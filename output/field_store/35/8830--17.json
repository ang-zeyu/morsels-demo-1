Then with his four  vessels,  two large and two small, he left the said port, which is  five degrees higher than the former port, and directed his course  west-southwest in search of the islands that he had discovered. He  took Pedro Merino Manrique as master-of-camp; his brother-in-law,  Lope de la Vega, as admiral; and Pedro Fernandez de Quiros as  chief pilot. Following the above-mentioned course he sailed to the  altitude of nine and one-half degrees, whence he sailed southwest by  west to fourteen degrees, where he changed his course to northwest  by west. On Friday, the twenty-first of the month of July, having  reached an altitude of ten long degrees, we sighted an island to  which the general gave the name of Madalena. [68] From a port of this  island, about seventy canoes came out, each containing three men,  or thereabout, while some came swimming and others on logs. There  were more than four hundred Indians, white and of a very agreeable  appearance, tall and strong, large-limbed, and so well made that  they by far surpassed us. [69] They had fine teeth, eyes, mouth,  hands and feet, and beautiful long flowing hair, while many of them  were very fair. Very handsome youths were to be seen among them;  all were naked and covered no part. Their bodies, legs, arms, hands,  and even some of their faces, were all marked after the fashion of  these Bissayans. And indeed, for a barbarous people, naked, and of  so little reason, one could not restrain himself, at sight of them,  from thanking God for having created them. And do not think this  exaggeration, for it was so. These people invited us to their port,  and were in turn invited to our flagship, and about forty of them  came aboard. In comparison with them we appeared to be men of less  than ordinary size. Among them was one who was thought to be a palmo  taller than the tallest man of our fleet, although we had in the  fleet men of more than average height. The general gave some of them  shirts and other things, which they accepted with much pleasure,  dancing after their fashion and calling others. But being annoyed  at the liberties that they took, for they were great thieves, the  general had a cannon fired, in order to frighten them. When they  heard it they all swam ashore, seized their weapons, and at the sound  of a conch threw a few stones at the ships and threatened us with  their lances, for they had no other weapons. Our men fired their  arquebuses at them from the ships and killed five or six of them,  whereat they stopped. Our fleet sailed on and we discovered three  other islands. This island has a circumference of about six leguas. We  passed it on its southern side. On that side it is high and slopes  precipitously to the sea, and has mountainous ravines where the  Indians dwell. There seemed to be many inhabitants, for we saw them  on the rocks and on the beach. And so we continued our course to the  other three islands. The first, to which was given the name San Pedro,  is about ten leguas from Magdalena, and like it extends northwest by  north. It has a circumference of about three leguas. The island is  beautiful, and rich in woods and fine fields. We did not ascertain  whether it was inhabited or not, for we did not stop there. To the  southeast and about five leguas from it lies another island to which  the general gave the name of Dominica. It is very sightly, and to  all appearances thickly populated, and has a circumference of about  fifteen leguas. To the south and a little more than one legua from  it lies another island with a circumference of about eight leguas,  which received the name of Sancta Cristina. Our fleet passed through  the channel that separates the one island from the other, for all that  we saw of these islands is clear sailing. On the west side of Sancta  Cristina, a good port was found, and there the fleet anchored. [70]  These Indians did not seem to me to resemble the first; but many  beautiful women were seen. I did not see the latter, but some who did  assured me that in their opinion, they are as beautiful as the women  in Lima, but light complexioned and not so tall--and the women in Lima  are very beautiful. The articles of food seen in that port were swine  and fowl, sugar-cane, excellent bananas, cocoanuts, and a fruit that  grows on high trees. Each of the last is as large as a good-sized  pineapple, and is excellent eating. Much of it was eaten green,  roasted, and boiled. When ripe it is indeed so sweet and good that,  in my estimation, there is no other that surpasses it. Scarcely any  of it, except a little husk, has to be thrown away. [71] There was  also another fruit with a flavor like that of chestnuts, but much  larger in size than six chestnuts put together; much of this fruit  was eaten roasted and boiled. Certain nuts with a very hard shell,  and very oily, were also found, which were eaten in great quantities,  and which, according to some, induced diarrhoea. We also saw some  Castilian pumpkins growing. Near the beach there is a fine cascade  of very clear water, which issues from a rock at the height of two  men. Its volume is about the width of four or five fingers. Then  near by there is a stream, from which the boats drew a full supply  of water. The Indians fled to the forests and rocks, where they  fortified themselves and tried to do some mischief, by throwing  stones and rolling down rocks, but they never wounded anyone, for  the master-of-camp restrained them, by placing outposts. The Indians  of this island, on seeing one of our negroes, made signs toward the  south, saying that there were men like him there, and that they were  wont to go there to fight; that the others were armed with arrows; and  that they make the journey thither in certain large canoes which they  possess. Since there was no interpreter, or much curiosity to learn  more, no further investigations were made, although, in my opinion,  this is impossible for Indians so remote, unless there be a chain of  islands; for their boats and their customs in other things show that  they have not come from any great distance.    This port lies in an altitude of nine and one-half degrees. The  adelantado ordered three crosses to be planted, and on Saturday, August  fifth, to weigh anchor and set sail southwest by west. We sailed with  easterly and east southeasterly winds, now southwest by west and now  northwest by west, for about four hundred leguas. One Sunday, August  twenty, we sighted four low islands with sandy beaches, abounding  in palms and other trees. On the southeast side, towards the north,  was seen a great sandbank. All four islands have a circuit of about  twelve leguas. Whether they were inhabited or not, we could not tell,  for we did not go to them. That year appeared to be one of talk, of  which I speak with anger. These islands lie in an altitude of ten and  three-quarters degrees. They were named San Bernardo, [72] because  they were discovered on that saint's day. Thenceforward we began to  meet southeasterly winds, which never failed us, and which seem to  prevail in those regions. With these winds we continued to sail always  in the said direction, never going above eleven or below ten degrees,  until Tuesday, August twenty-nine, when we discovered a round islet,  of about one legua in circumference, surrounded by reefs. We tried  to land there, so that the almiranta could take on wood and water, of  which there was great need, but could find no landing-place. We gave  it the name of La Solitaria [Solitary Island]. It lies in an altitude  of ten and two-thirds degrees, and is about one thousand five hundred  and thirty five leguas from Lima. [73] From this island we continued  to sail in the said course: a thing which drew a variety of opinions  from the men, some saying that we did not know where we were going,  and other things which did not fail to cause some hard feelings; but by  the mercy of God, at midnight on the eve of Nuestra Se√±ora de Setiembre  [Our Lady of September], we sighted an island of about ninety or one  hundred leguas in circumference, which extends almost east southeast  and west northwest, and lies about one thousand eight hundred leguas  from Lima. [74] The whole island is full of dense forests, even to  the highest ridges; and where it was not cleared for the Indians'  fields, not a palmo of earth could be seen. The ships anchored in a  port on the north side of the island, in ten degrees of latitude. About  seven leguas north of that port, there is a volcano with a very well  shaped cone, which ejects much fire from its summit, and from other  parts. The volcano is high and about three leguas in circumference. On  the side toward the sea it is very steep and quite bare, and offers  no landing; and it rumbles frequently and loudly within. Northeast of  this volcano are several small inhabited islets, surrounded by many  shoals. The distance to these islets is seven or eight leguas. The  shoals extend about northwest, and one who saw them said that they  were numerous. Around the large island were several small ones, and  as we sailed around them, we found that they were all inhabited,  even the large one. Within sight of this large island, and to the  southeast of it, we saw another island of no great size. This must  be the connecting link with the other islands. [75] After having put  into port at the great island Sancta Cruz, as it had been named, the  adelantado ordered Captain Don Lorenzo, his brother-in-law, to go with  the frigate in search of the almiranta, of which I have no favorable  conjectures, and which had disappeared on the night that we sighted the  island. It was sought on this and on two other occasions, but nothing  except the shoals above-mentioned were found. What was seen in the  way of food in this bay and port was swine, fowl, bananas, sugar-cane,  some two or three"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7005"],[0,"The Antiquary ‚Äî Complete (#15)"],[1,"provost of  Fairport (who, as we before noticed, was the father of our Antiquary)  sallied from his ancient burgh, heading a body of whig-burghers,  and seized at once, in the name of George II., upon the Castle of  Knockwinnock, and on the four carriage-horses, and person of the  proprietor. Sir Anthony was shortly after sent off to the Tower of  London by a secretary of state's warrant, and with him went his son,  Arthur, then a youth. But as nothing appeared like an overt act of  treason, both father and son were soon set at liberty, and returned to  their own mansion of Knockwinnock, to drink healths five fathoms deep,  and talk of their sufferings in the royal cause. This became so much a  matter of habit with Sir Arthur, that, even after his father's death,  the non-juring chaplain used to pray regularly for the restoration  of the rightful sovereign, for the downfall of the usurper, and for  deliverance from their cruel and bloodthirsty enemies; although all idea  of serious opposition to the House of Hanover had long mouldered away,  and this treasonable liturgy was kept up rather as a matter of form  than as conveying any distinct meaning. So much was this the case, that,  about the year 1770, upon a disputed election occurring in the county,  the worthy knight fairly gulped down the oaths of abjuration  and allegiance, in order to serve a candidate in whom he was  interested;--thus renouncing the heir for whose restoration he weekly  petitioned Heaven, and acknowledging the usurper whose dethronement he  had never ceased to pray for. And to add to this melancholy instance  of human inconsistency, Sir Arthur continued to pray for the House  of Stuart even after the family had been extinct, and when, in truth,  though in his theoretical loyalty he was pleased to regard them as  alive, yet, in all actual service and practical exertion, he was a most  zealous and devoted subject of George III.    In other respects, Sir Arthur Wardour lived like most country gentlemen  in Scotland, hunted and fished--gave and received dinners--attended races  and county meetings--was a deputy-lieutenant and trustee upon turnpike  acts. But, in his more advanced years, as he became too lazy or unwieldy  for field-sports, he supplied them by now and then reading Scottish  history; and, having gradually acquired a taste for antiquities, though  neither very deep nor very correct, he became a crony of his neighbour,  Mr. Oldbuck of Monkbarns, and a joint-labourer with him in his  antiquarian pursuits.    There were, however, points of difference between these two humourists,  which sometimes occasioned discord. The faith of Sir Arthur, as an  antiquary, was boundless, and Mr. Oldbuck (notwithstanding the affair  of the Praetorium at the Kaim of Kinprunes) was much more scrupulous in  receiving legends as current and authentic coin. Sir Arthur would have  deemed himself guilty of the crime of leze-majesty had he doubted the  existence of any single individual of that formidable head-roll of one  hundred and four kings of Scotland, received by Boethius, and rendered  classical by Buchanan, in virtue of whom James VI. claimed to rule his  ancient kingdom, and whose portraits still frown grimly upon the walls  of the gallery of Holyrood. Now Oldbuck, a shrewd and suspicious man,  and no respecter of divine hereditary right, was apt to cavil at this  sacred list, and to affirm, that the procession of the posterity  of Fergus through the pages of Scottish history, was as vain and  unsubstantial as the gleamy pageant of the descendants of Banquo through  the cavern of Hecate.    Another tender topic was the good fame of Queen Mary, of which the  knight was a most chivalrous assertor, while the esquire impugned it,  in spite both of her beauty and misfortunes. When, unhappily, their  conversation turned on yet later times, motives of discord occurred in  almost every page of history. Oldbuck was, upon principle, a staunch  Presbyterian, a ruling elder of the kirk, and a friend to revolution  principles and Protestant succession, while Sir Arthur was the very  reverse of all this. They agreed, it is true, in dutiful love and  allegiance to the sovereign who now fills* the throne; but this was  their only point of union.    * The reader will understand that this refers to the reign of our late  gracious Sovereign, George the Third.    It therefore often happened, that bickerings hot broke out between them,  in which Oldbuck was not always able to suppress his caustic humour,  while it would sometimes occur to the Baronet that the descendant of a  German printer, whose sires had \"sought the base fellowship of paltry  burghers,\" forgot himself, and took an unlicensed freedom of debate,  considering the rank and ancient descent of his antagonist. This, with  the old feud of the coach-horses, and the seizure of his manor-place and  tower of strength by Mr. Oldbuck's father, would at times rush upon his  mind, and inflame at once his cheeks and his arguments. And, lastly, as  Mr. Oldbuck thought his worthy friend and compeer was in some respects  little better than a fool, he was apt to come more near communicating  to him that unfavourable opinion, than the rules of modern politeness  warrant. In such cases they often parted in deep dudgeon, and with  something like a resolution to forbear each other's company in future:    But with the morning calm reflection came; and as each was sensible that  the society of the other had become, through habit, essential to  his comfort, the breach was speedily made up between them. On such  occasions, Oldbuck, considering that the Baronet's pettishness resembled  that of a child, usually showed his superior sense by compassionately  making the first advances to reconciliation. But it once or twice  happened that the aristocratic pride of the far-descended knight took  a flight too offensive to the feelings of the representative of the  typographer. In these cases, the breach between these two originals  might have been immortal, but for the kind exertion and interposition  of the Baronet's daughter, Miss Isabella Wardour, who, with a son, now  absent upon foreign and military service, formed his whole surviving  family. She was well aware how necessary Mr. Oldbuck was to her father's  amusement and comfort, and seldom failed to interpose with effect, when  the office of a mediator between them was rendered necessary by the  satirical shrewdness of the one, or the assumed superiority of the  other. Under Isabella's mild influence, the wrongs of Queen Mary were  forgotten by her father, and Mr. Oldbuck forgave the blasphemy which  reviled the memory of King William. However, as she used in general to  take her father's part playfully in these disputes, Oldbuck was wont to  call Isabella his fair enemy, though in fact he made more account of her  than any other of her sex, of whom, as we have seen, he, was no admirer.    There existed another connection betwixt these worthies, which had  alternately a repelling and attractive influence upon their intimacy.  Sir Arthur always wished to borrow; Mr. Oldbuck was not always willing  to lend. Mr. Oldbuck, per contra, always wished to be repaid with  regularity; Sir Arthur was not always, nor indeed often, prepared to  gratify this reasonable desire; and, in accomplishing an arrangement  between tendencies so opposite, little miffs would occasionally take  place. Still there was a spirit of mutual accommodation upon the whole,  and they dragged on like dogs in couples, with some difficulty and  occasional snarling, but without absolutely coming to a stand-still or  throttling each other.    Some little disagreement, such as we have mentioned, arising out of  business, or politics, had divided the houses of Knockwinnock and  Monkbarns, when the emissary of the latter arrived to discharge his  errand. In his ancient Gothic parlour, whose windows on one side looked  out upon the restless ocean, and, on the other, upon the long straight  avenue, was the Baronet seated, now turning over the leaves of a folio,  now casting a weary glance where the sun quivered on the dark-green  foliage and smooth trunks of the large and branching limes with which  the avenue was planted. At length, sight of joy! a moving object is  seen, and it gives rise to the usual inquiries, Who is it? and what can  be his errand? The old whitish-grey coat, the hobbling gait, the hat  half-slouched, half-cocked, announced the forlorn maker of periwigs, and  left for investigation only the second query. This was soon solved by a  servant entering the parlour,--\"A letter from Monkbarns, Sir Arthur.\"    Sir Arthur took the epistle with a due assumption of consequential  dignity.    \"Take the old man into the kitchen, and let him get some refreshment,\"  said the young lady, whose compassionate eye had remarked his thin grey  hair and wearied gait.    \"Mr. Oldbuck, my love, invites us to dinner on Tuesday the 17th,\" said  the Baronet, pausing;--\"he really seems to forget that he has not of late  conducted himself so civilly towards me as might have been expected.\"    \"Dear sir, you have so many advantages over poor Mr. Oldbuck, that no  wonder it should put him a little out of humour; but I know he has much  respect for your person and your conversation;--nothing would give him  more pain than to be wanting in any real attention.\"    \"True, true, Isabella; and one must allow for the original  descent;--something of the German boorishness still flows in the blood;  something of the whiggish and perverse opposition to established rank  and privilege. You may observe that he never has any advantage of me  in dispute, unless when he avails himself of a sort of pettifogging  intimacy with dates, names, and trifling matters of fact--a tiresome and  frivolous accuracy of memory, which is entirely owing to his mechanical  descent.\"    \"He must find it convenient in historical investigation, I should think,"]]]
