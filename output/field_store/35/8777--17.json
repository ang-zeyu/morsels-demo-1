Then, before he could stir or utter any protest, the golden-haired  princess whom he had come to rescue stooped, threw her arms around his  neck, and kissed him.    \"You darling, brave boy!\" she said. \"I think you have saved me from  madness.\"    Young Kerry, more flushed than ever, extricated himself, and:    \"You're not out of the mess yet,\" he protested. \"The only difference is  that I'm in it with you!\"    \"But where is your father?\"    \"I'm looking for him.\"    \"What!\"    \"Oh! he's about somewhere,\" Dan assured her confidently.    \"But, but----\" She was gazing at him wide-eyed, \"Didn't he send you  here?\"    \"You bet he didn't,\" returned young Kerry. \"I came here on my own  accord, and when I go you're coming with me. I can't make out how you  got here, anyway. Do you know whose house this is?\"    \"Oh, I do, I do!\"    \"Whose?\"    \"It belongs to a man called Chada.\"    \"Chada? Never heard of him. But I mean, what part of London is it in?\"    \"Whatever do you mean? It is in Limehouse, I believe. I don't  understand. You came here.\"    \"I didn't,\" said young Kerry cheerfully; \"I was fetched!\"    \"By your father?\"    \"Not on your life. By a couple of Chinks! I'll tell you something.\"  He raised his twinkling blue eyes. \"We are properly up against it. I  suppose you couldn't climb down a rain-pipe?\"          VII    RETRIBUTION        It was that dark, still, depressing hour of the night, when all life  is at its lowest ebb. In the low, strangely perfumed room of books Zani  Chada sat before his table, his yellow hands clutching the knobs on his  chair arms, his long, inscrutable eyes staring unseeingly before him.    Came a disturbance and the sound of voices, and Lou Chada, his son,  stood at the doorway. He still wore his evening clothes, but he no  longer looked smart. His glossy black hair was dishevelled, and his  handsome, olive face bore a hunted look. Panic was betoken by twitching  mouth and fear-bright eyes. He stopped, glaring at his father, and:    \"Why are you not gone?\" asked the latter sternly. \"Do you wish to wreck  me as well as yourself?\"    \"The police have posted a man opposite Kwee's house. I cannot get out  that way.\"    \"There was no one there when the boy was brought in.\"    \"No, but there is now. Father!\" He took a step forward. \"I'm trapped.  They sha'n't take me. You won't let them take me?\"    Zani Chada stirred not a muscle, but:    \"To-night,\" he said, \"your mad passion has brought ruin to both of us.  For the sake of a golden doll who is not worth the price of the jewels  she wears, you have placed yourself within reach of the hangman.\"    \"I was mad, I was mad,\" groaned the other.    \"But I, who was sane, am involved in the consequences,\" retorted his  father.    \"He will be silent at the price of the boy's life.\"    \"He may be,\" returned Zani Chada. \"I hate him, but he is a man. Had you  escaped, he might have consented to be silent. Once you are arrested,  nothing would silence him.\"    \"If the case is tried it will ruin Pat's reputation.\"    \"What a pity!\" said Zani Chada.    In some distant part of the house a gong was struck three times.    \"Go,\" commanded his father. \"Remain at Kwee's house until I send for  you. Let Ah Fang go to the room above and see that the woman is silent.  An outcry would ruin our last chance.\"    Lou Chada raised his hands, brushing the hair back from his wet  forehead, then, staring haggardly at his father, turned and ran from the  room.    A minute later Kerry was ushered in by the Chinese servant. The savage  face was set like a mask. Without removing his hat, he strode across  to the table and bent down so that fierce, wide-open blue eyes stared  closely into long, half-closed black ones.    \"I've got one thing to say,\" explained Kerry huskily. \"Whatever the  hangman may do to your slimy son, and whatever happens to the little  blonde fool he kidnapped, if you've laid a hand on my kid I'll kick you  to death, if I follow you round the world to do it.\"    Zani Chada made no reply, but his knuckles gleamed, so tightly did he  clutch the knobs on the chair arms. Kerry's savagery would have awed  any man, even though he had supposed it to be the idle threat of a  passionate man. But Zani Chada knew all men, and he knew this one. When  Daniel Kerry declared that in given circumstances he would kick Zani  Chada to death, he did not mean that he would shoot him, strangle him,  or even beat him with his fists; he meant precisely what he said--that  he would kick him to death--and Zani Chada knew it.    Thus there were some moments of tense silence during which the savage  face of the Chief Inspector drew even closer to the gaunt, yellow face  of the Eurasian. Finally:    \"Listen only for one moment,\" said Zani Chada. His voice had lost  its guttural intonation. He spoke softly, sibilantly. \"I, too, am a  father------\"    \"Don't mince words!\" shouted Kerry. \"You've kidnapped my boy. If I have  to tear your house down brick by brick I'll find him. And if you've hurt  one hair of his head--you know what to expect!\"    He quivered. The effort of suppression which he had imposed upon himself  was frightful to witness. Zani Chada, student of men, knew that in  despite of his own physical strength and of the hidden resources at his  beck, he stood nearer to primitive retribution than he had ever done.  Yet:    \"I understand,\" he continued. \"But you do not understand. Your boy is  not in this house. Oh! violence cannot avail! It can only make his loss  irreparable.\"    Kerry, nostrils distended, eyes glaring madly, bent over him.    \"Your scallywag of a son,\" he said hoarsely, \"has gone one step too far.  His adventures have twice before ended in murder--and you have covered  him. This time you can't do it. I'm not to be bought. We've stood for  the Far East in London long enough. Your cub hangs this time. Get me?  There'll be no bargaining. The woman's reputation won't stop me. My  kid's danger won't stop me. But if you try to use him as a lever I'll  boot you to your stinking yellow paradise and they'll check you in as  pulp.\"    \"You speak of three deaths,\" murmured Zani Chada.    Kerry clenched his teeth so tightly that his maxillary muscles protruded  to an abnormal degree. He thrust his clenched fists into his coat  pockets.    \"We all follow our vocations in life,\" resumed the Eurasian, \"to the  best of our abilities. But is professional kudos not too dearly bought  at the price of a loved one lost for ever? A far better bargain  would be, shall we say, ten thousand pounds, as the price of a silk  handkerchief------\"    Kerry's fierce blue eyes closed for a fraction of a second. Yet, in that  fraction of a second, he had visualized some of the things which ten  thousand pounds--a sum he could never hope to possess--would buy. He had  seen his home, as he would have it--and he had seen Dan there, safe and  happy at his mother's side. Was he entitled to disregard the happiness  of his wife, the life of his boy, the honourable name of Sir  Noel Rourke, because an outcast like Peters had come to a fitting  end--because a treacherous Malay and a renegade Chinaman had, earlier,  gone the same way, sped, as he suspected, by the same hand?    \"My resources are unusual,\" added Chada, speaking almost in a whisper.  \"I have cash to this amount in my safe------\"    So far he had proceeded when he was interrupted; and the cause of the  interruption was this:    A few moments earlier another dramatic encounter had taken place in a  distant part of the house. Kerry Junior, having scientifically tested  all the possible modes of egress from the room in which Lady Pat was  confined, had long ago desisted, and had exhausted his ingenuity in  plans which discussion had proved to be useless. In spite of the novelty  and the danger of his situation, nature was urging her laws. He was  growing sleepy. The crowning tragedy had been the discovery that he  could not regain the small, square window set high in the wall from  which he had dropped into this luxurious prison. Now, as the two sat  side by side upon a cushioned divan, the woman's arm about the boy's  shoulders, they were startled to hear, in the depths of the house, three  notes of a gong.    Young Kerry's sleepiness departed. He leapt to his feet as though  electrified.    \"What was that?\"    There was something horrifying in those gong notes in the stillness of  the night. Lady Pat's beautiful eyes grew glassy with fear.    \"I don't know,\" replied Dan. \"It seemed to come from below.\"    He ran to the door, drew the curtain aside, and pressed his ear against  one of the panels, listening intently. As he did so, his attitude grew  tense, his expression changed, then:    \"We're saved!\" he cried, turning a radiant face to the woman. \"I heard  my father's voice!\"    \"Oh, are you sure, are you sure?\"    \"Absolutely sure!\"    He bent to press his ear to the panel again, when a stifled cry from his  companion brought him swiftly to his feet. The second door in the room  had opened silently, and a small Chinaman, who carried himself with a  stoop, had entered, and now, a menacing expression upon his face, was  quickly approaching the boy.    What he had meant to do for ever remained in doubt, for young Kerry,  knowing his father to be in the house and seeing an open door before  him, took matters into his own hands. At the moment that the silent  Chinaman was about to throw his arms about him, the pride of the junior  school registered a most surprising left accurately on the point of Ah  Fang's jaw, following it up by a wilful transgression of Queensberry  rules in the form of a stomach punch which temporarily decided the  issue. Then:    \"Quick! quick!\" he cried breathlessly, grasping Lady Pat's hand. \"This  is where we run!\"    In such fashion was Zani Chada interrupted, the interruption taking the  form of a sudden, shrill outcry:    \"Dad! dad! Where are you, dad?\"    Kerry spun about as a man"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/571"],[0,"The 1995 CIA World Factbook (#15)"],[1,"country for cocaine   headed for the US and Europe     Economic aid:   recipient: US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $1 billion;   Western (non-US) countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments   (1970-89), $4.4 billion; Communist countries (1970-89), $718 million     Currency: 1 nuevo peso argentino = 100 centavos     Exchange rates: pesos per US$1 - 0.99870 (December 1994), 0.99901   (1994), 0.99895 (1993), 0.99064 (1992), 0.95355 (1991), 0.48759 (1990)     Fiscal year: calendar year    @Argentina:Transportation     Railroads:   total: 34,572 km   broad gauge: NA km 1.676-m gauge   standard gauge: NA km 1.435-m   narrow gauge: 400 km 0.750-m gauge; NA km 1.000-m gauge (209 km   electrified)     Highways:   total: 208,350 km   paved: 57,000 km   unpaved: gravel 39,500 km; improved/unimproved earth 111,850 km     Inland waterways: 11,000 km navigable     Pipelines: crude oil 4,090 km; petroleum products 2,900 km; natural   gas 9,918 km     Ports: Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Comodoro Rivadavia, Concepcion del   Uruguay, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Necochea, Rio Gallegos, Rosario,   Santa Fe, Ushuaia     Merchant marine:   total: 44 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 434,525 GRT/667,501 DWT   ships by type: bulk 3, cargo 21, chemical tanker 1, container 4, oil   tanker 8, railcar carrier 1, refrigerated cargo 5, roll-on/roll-off   cargo 1     Airports:   total: 1,602   with paved runways over 3,047 m: 5   with paved runways 2,438 to 3,047 m: 25   with paved runways 1,524 to 2,437 m: 55   with paved runways 914 to 1,523 m: 48   with paved runways under 914 m: 703   with unpaved runways over 3,047 m: 2   with unpaved runways 2,438 to 3,047 m: 1   with unpaved runways 1,524 to 2,438 m: 70   with unpaved runways 914 to 1,523 m: 693    @Argentina:Communications     Telephone system: 2,650,000 telephones; 12,000 public telephones; 78   telephones/1,000 persons; extensive modern system but many families do   not have telephones; microwave widely used; however, during   rainstorms, the telephone system frequently grounds out, even in   Buenos Aires   local: NA   intercity: microwave radio relay and domestic satellite network with   40 earth stations   international: 2 INTELSAT (Atlantic Ocean) earth stations     Radio:   broadcast stations: AM 171, FM 0, shortwave 13   radios: NA     Television:   broadcast stations: 231   televisions: NA    @Argentina:Defense Forces     Branches: Argentine Army, Navy of the Argentine Republic, Argentine   Air Force, National Gendarmerie, Argentine Naval Prefecture (Coast   Guard only), National Aeronautical Police Force     Manpower availability: males age 15-49 8,573,780; males fit for   military service 6,954,584; males reach military age (20) annually   301,166 (1995 est.)
