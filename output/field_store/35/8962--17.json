He then said, \"Shut the door,\" and the door  closed itself again.    Juan was not sure whether any one else was inside, but he was no  coward and besides he thought he might as well be murdered as starved  to death, so when the robbers had ridden away to a safe distance  without seeing him, he went boldly up to the cliff and said, \"Open  the door.\" The door opened as obediently to him as to the robber,  and he went in. He found himself inside a great cavern filled with  money, jewels, and rich stuffs of every kind.    Hastily gathering more than enough gold and jewels to make him rich,  he went outside, not forgetting to say, \"Close the door,\" and went  back to his house.    Having hidden all but a little of his new wealth, he wished to change  one or two of his gold pieces for silver so that he could buy something  to eat. He went to his brother's house to ask him for the favor,  but Pedro was not at home, and his wife, who was at least as mean as  Pedro, would not change the money. After a while Pedro came home, and  his wife told him that Juan had some money; and Pedro, hoping in turn  to gain some advantage, went to Juan's house and asked many questions  about the money. Juan told him that he had sold some wood in town and  had been paid in gold, but Pedro did not believe him and hid himself  under the house to listen. At night he heard Juan talking to his wife,  and found out the place and the password. Immediately taking three  horses to carry his spoils, he set out for the robbers' cave.    Once arrived, he went straight to the cliff and said, \"Open the door,\"  and the door opened immediately. He went inside and said, \"Close the  door,\" and the door closed tight. He gathered together fifteen great  bags of money, each all he could lift, and carried them to the door  ready to put on the horses. He found all the rich food and wine of  the robbers in the cave, and could not resist the temptation to make  merry at their expense; so he ate their food and drank their fine  wines till he was foolishly drunk. When he had reached this state,  he began to think of returning home. Beating on the door with both  hands, he cried out, \"Open, beast. Open, fool. May lightning blast  you if you do not open!\" and a hundred other foolish things, but  never once saying, \"Open the door.\"    While he was thus engaged, the robbers returned, and hearing them  coming he hid under a great pile of money with only his nose sticking  out. The robbers saw that some one had visited the cave in their  absence and hunted for the intruder till one of them discovered him  trembling under a heap of coin. With a shout they hauled him forth  and beat him until his flesh hung in ribbons. Then they split him into  halves and threw the body into the river, and cut his horses into bits,  [15] which they threw after him.    When Pedro did not return, his wife became anxious and told Juan  where he had gone. Juan stole quietly to the place by night, and  recovered the body, carried it home, and had the pieces sewn together  by the tailor.    Now the robbers knew that they had been robbed by some one else, and  so, when Pedro's body was taken away, the captain went to town to see  who had buried the body, and by inquiring, found that Juan had become  suddenly rich, and also that it was his brother who had been buried.    So the captain of the robbers went to Juan's house, where he found  a ball going on. Juan knew the captain again and that he was asking  many questions, so he made the captain welcome and gave him a great  deal to eat and drink. One of the servants came in and pretended  to admire the captain's sword till he got it into his own hands;  and then he began to give an exhibition of fencing, making the sword  whirl hither and thither and ending with a wonderful stroke that made  the captain's head roll on the floor.    A day or two later, the lieutenant also came to town, and began to make  inquiries concerning the captain. He soon found out that the captain  had been killed in Juan's house, but Juan now had soldiers on guard  at his door, so that it was necessary to use strategy. He went to  Juan and asked if he could start a \"tienda,\" or wine-shop, and Juan,  who recognized the lieutenant, said, \"Yes.\" Then the lieutenant went  away, soon returning with seven great casks, in each of which he had  seven men.    These he stored under Juan's house until such time as Juan, being  asleep, could be killed with certainty and little danger. When  this was done, he went into the house, intending to make Juan drunk  and then kill him as Juan had the captain. Juan, however, got the  lieutenant drunk first, and soon his head, like the captain's, rolled  on the floor.    The soldiers below, like all soldiers, wished to have a drink from  the great casks, and so one of them took a borer and bored into one of  the casks. As he did so, a voice whispered, \"Is Juan asleep yet?\" The  soldier replied, \"Not yet,\" and went and told Juan. The casks by  his order were all put into a boat, loaded with stones and chains,  and thrown into the sea. So perished the last of the robbers.    Juan, being no longer in fear of the robbers, often went to their  cave, and helped himself to everything that he wanted. He finally  became a very great and wealthy man. [16]      CHAPTER 13    The Covetous King and the Three Children.    There were once three orphan children, the oldest of whom was perhaps  ten years old, and the others but little things, almost babies. They  had a tiny little tumble-down house to live in, but very little to  eat. Said the eldest to his little brother and sister, \"I will go  yonder on the sands laid bare by the falling tide, and it may be that  I shall find something that we can eat.\" The little children begged  to go, too, and they all set out over the sands. Soon they found  a large living shell. \"Thanks be to God,\" said the boy, for he was  well instructed, \"we shall have something to eat.\" \"Take me home,  but do not cook me,\" said the shell, \"and I will work for you.\" Now  this was probably the Holy Virgin herself, in the form of a shell,  who had taken pity on the poor children. They took the shell home,  and there it spoke again. \"Put me into the rice pot, cover me up,  and you shall turn out plenty of boiled rice for all of you.\" And  they did so, and the boiled rice came from the pot. \"Now put me  into the other pot, and take out ulam.\" And they took out ulam in  abundance. \"Have you a clothes chest?\" asked the shell; but there  was none, so they put it into a box, and the box became filled with  clothing. Then the shell filled the spare room with rice, and last  of all filled another large box with money.    Now the king of this city was a cruel man, and he sent for the children  and told them that they must give up their money, their rice and all  to him and be poor again. \"O dear king,\" said the oldest child, \"will  you not leave us a little for our living?\" \"No,\" replied the king,  \"I will give you as much boiled rice as you need, and you ought to  be glad that you get it.\"    So the king sent ten soldiers to move the rice and the money, but,  as soon as they got it to the king's house, it returned to the  children. The soldiers worked a whole week without getting a grain  of rice or a piece of money to stay in the king's house. Then because  they were about to die from fatigue, the king sent ten more, and these  too failed. Then the king went himself, but when he tried to move  the money he fell down dead. The children, relieved from persecution,  lived long and happy lives and were always rich and influential people.      CHAPTER 14    The Silent Lover.    A long time ago, when the world was young, there lived a very bashful  young man. Not far from his house there lived the most beautiful young  woman in the world. The young woman had many suitors but rejected all,  wishing only for the love of the bashful young man. He in his turn  was accustomed to follow her about, longing for courage to declare his  love, but bashfulness always sealed his lips. At last, despairing of  ever making his unruly tongue tell of his passion, he took a dagger  and, following her to the bathing place on the river bank, he cut  out his own heart, cast it at her feet, and fell down lifeless. The  girl fled, terrified, and a crow pounced upon the heart, and carried  it to a hollow dao-tree, when it fell from his beak into the hollow  and there remained. But the love for the girl was so strong in the  heart that it became reanimated and clothed again with humanity in the  form of a little child. A hunter, pursuing the wild boar with dogs,  found the child crying from hunger at the foot of the dao-tree and,  being childless, took it home, and he and his old wife cared for it  as their own. The young woman, knowing now the love of the young man,  lived for his memory's sake, a widow, rejecting all suitors.    But from the child was never absent the image of his loved one, and at  last his love so wrought on his weak frame that he sickened. Knowing  that his end was near, he begged of his foster mother that, after his  death, she should leave him, and not be surprised if she could not  find him on her return. He also asked that on the third day she should  take whatever she should find in a certain compartment of the great  chest and give it to the girl without price. All this she promised,  realizing fully that this was not a natural child.    At last he died, and when his foster mother left the body, his great  love reanimated the body and it crept into the chest, becoming there  transformed into a beautifully carved casket of fragrant wood.    Obedient to his wishes, on the third day the old woman carried the  casket to the girl, giving it to her without price.    When the girl took the casket into her hands, its charm fascinated  her, and she clasped it tight and covered it with kisses. At last the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11029"],[0,"American Hero-Myths: A Study in the Native Religions of the Western Continent (#16)"],[1,"_zacuantototl_.]    As the fumes of the liquor still further disordered his reason, he called  his attendants and bade them hasten to his sister Quetzalpetlatl, who  dwelt on the Mountain Nonoalco, and bring her, that she too might taste  the divine liquor. The attendants hurried off and said to his sister:--    \"Noble lady, we have come for you. The high priest Quetzalcoatl awaits  you. It is his wish that you come and live with him.\"    She instantly obeyed and went with them. On her arrival Quetzalcoatl  seated her beside him and gave her to drink of the magical pulque.  Immediately she felt its influence, and Quetzalcoatl began to sing, in  drunken fashion--    \"Sister mine, beloved mine,    Quetzal--petlatl--tzin,  Come with me, drink with me,    'Tis no sin, sin, sin.\"    Soon they were so drunken that all reason was forgotten; they said no  prayers, they went not to the bath, and they sank asleep on the floor.[1]    [Footnote 1: It is not clear, at least in the translations, whether the  myth intimates an incestuous relation between Quetzalcoatl and his sister.  In the song he calls her \"Nohueltiuh,\" which means, strictly, \"My elder  sister;\" but Mendoza translates it \"Querida esposa mia.\" _Quetzalpetlatl_  means \"the Beautiful Carpet,\" _petlatl_ being the rug or mat used on  floors, etc. This would be a most appropriate figure of speech to describe  a rich tropical landscape, \"carpeted with flowers,\" as we say; and as the  earth is, in primitive cosmogony, older than the sun, I suspect that this  story of Quetzalcoatl and his sister refers to the sun sinking from  heaven, seemingly, into the earth. \"Los Nahoas,\" remarks Chavero,  \"figuraban la tierra en forma de un cuadrilatero dividido en pequenos  quatros, lo que semijaba una estera, _petlatl_\" (_Anales del Museo  Nacional_, Tom. ii, p. 248).]    Sad, indeed, was Quetzalcoatl the next morning.    \"I have sinned,\" he said; \"the stain on my name can never be erased. I am  not fit to rule this people. Let them build for me a habitation deep under  ground; let them bury my bright treasures in the earth; let them throw the  gleaming gold and shining stones into the holy fountain where I take my  daily bath.\"    All this was done, and Quetzalcoatl spent four days in his underground  tomb. When he came forth he wept and told his followers that the time had  come for him to depart for Tlapallan, the Red Land, Tlillan, the Dark  Land, and Tlatlallan, the Fire Land, all names of one locality.    He journeyed eastward until he came to a place where the sky, and land,  and water meet together.[1] There his attendants built a funeral pile, and  he threw himself into the flames. As his body burned his heart rose to  heaven, and after four days became the planet Venus.[2]    [Footnote 1: Designated in the Aztec original by the name _Teoapan  Ilhuicaatenco_, from _teotl_, divine, _atl_, water, _pan_, in or near,  _ilhuicac_, heaven, _atenco_, the waterside: \"Near the divine water, where  the sky meets the strand.\"]    [Footnote 2: The whole of this account is from the _Anales de  Cuauhtitlan_, pp. 16-22.]    That there is a profound moral significance in this fiction all will see;  but I am of opinion that it is accidental and adventitious. The means that  Tezcatlipoca employs to remove Quetzalcoatl refer to the two events that  mark the decline of day. The sun is reflected by a long lane of beams in  the surface waters of lake or sea; it loses the strength of its rays and  fails in vigor; while the evening mists, the dampness of approaching  dewfall, and the gathering clouds obscure its power and foretell the  extinction which will soon engulf the bright luminary. As Quetzalcoatl  cast his shining gold and precious stones into the water where he took his  nightly bath, or buried them in underground hiding places, so the sun  conceals his glories under the waters, or in the distant hills, into which  he seems to sink. As he disappears at certain seasons, the Star of Evening  shines brightly forth amid the lingering and fading rays, rising, as it  were, from the dying fires of the sunset.    To this it may be objected that the legend makes Quetzalcoatl journey  toward the East, and not toward the sunset. The explanation of this  apparent contradiction is easy. The Aztec sages had at some time  propounded to themselves the question of how the sun, which seems to set  in the West, can rise the next morning in the East? Mungo Parke tells us  that when he asked the desert Arabs this conundrum, they replied that the  inquiry was frivolous and childish, as being wholly beyond the capacities  of the human mind. The Aztecs did not think so, and had framed a definite  theory which overcame the difficulty. It was that, in fact, the sun only  advances to the zenith, and then returns to the East, from whence it  started. What we seem to see as the sun between the zenith and the western  horizon is, in reality, not the orb itself, but only its _brightness_, one  of its accidents, not its substance, to use the terms of metaphysics.  Hence to the Aztec astronomer and sage, the house of the sun is always  toward the East.[1]    [Footnote 1: Ramirez de Fuen-leal, _Historia_, cap. xx, p. 102.]    We need not have recourse even to this explanation. The sun, indeed,  disappears in the West; but his journey must necessarily be to the East,  for it is from that point that he always comes forth each morning. The  Light-God must necessarily daily return to the place whence he started.    The symbols of the mirror and the mystic drink are perfectly familiar in  Aryan sun-myths. The best known of the stories referring to the former is  the transparent tale of Narcissus forced by Nemesis to fall in love with  his own image reflected in the waters, and to pine away through  unsatisfied longing; or, as Pausanias tells the story, having lost his  twin sister (the morning twilight), he wasted his life in noting the  likeness of his own features to those of his beloved who had passed away.  \"The sun, as he looks down upon his own face reflected in a lake or sea,  sinks or dies at last, still gazing on it.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Sir George A. Cox, _The Science of Mythology and Folk Lore_,  p. 96.]    Some later writers say that the drink which Quetzalcoatl quaffed was to  confer immortality. This is not stated in the earliest versions of the  myth. The beverage is health-giving and intoxicating, and excites the  desire to seek Tlapallan, but not more. It does not, as the Soma of the  Vedas, endow with unending life.    Nevertheless, there is another myth which countenances this view and  explains it. It was told in the province of Meztitlan, a mountainous  country to the northwest of the province of Vera Cruz. Its inhabitants  spoke the Nahuatl tongue, but were never subject to the Montezumas. Their  chief god was Tezcatlipoca, and it was said of him that on one occasion he  slew Ometochtli (Two Rabbits), the god of wine, at the latter's own  request, he believing that he thus would be rendered immortal, and that  all others who drank of the beverage he presided over would die. His  death, they added, was indeed like the stupor of a drunkard, who, after  his lethargy has passed, rises healthy and well. In this sense of renewing  life after death, he presided over the native calendar, the count of years  beginning with Tochtli, the Rabbit.[1] Thus we see that this is a myth of  the returning seasons, and of nature waking to life again after the cold  months ushered in by the chill rains of the late autumn. The principle of  fertility is alone perennial, while each individual must perish and die.  The God of Wine in Mexico, as in Greece, is one with the mysterious force  of reproduction.    [Footnote 1: Gabriel de Chaves, _Relacion de la Provincia de Meztitlan_,  1556, in the _Colecion de Documentos Ineditos del Archivo de Indias_, Tom.  iv, p. 536.]    No writer has preserved such numerous traditions about the tricks of  Tezcatlipoca in Tollan, as Father Sahagun. They are, no doubt, almost  verbally reported as he was told them, and as he wrote his history first  in the Aztec tongue, they preserve all the quaintness of the original  tales. Some of them appear to be idle amplifications of story tellers,  while others are transparent myths. I shall translate a few of them quite  literally, beginning with that of the mystic beverage.    The time came for the luck of Quetzalcoatl and the Toltecs to end; for  there appeared against them three sorcerers, named Vitzilopochtli,  Titlacauan and Tlacauepan,[1] who practiced many villanies in the city of  Tullan. Titlacauan began them, assuming the disguise of an old man of  small stature and white hairs. With this figure he approached the palace  of Quetzalcoatl and said to the servants:--    [Footnote 1: Titlacauan was the common name of Tezcatlipoca. The three  sorcerers were really Quetzalcoatl's three brothers, representing the  three other cardinal points.]    \"I wish to see the King and speak to him.\"    \"Away with you, old man;\" said the servants. \"You cannot see him. He is  sick. You would only annoy him.\"    \"I must see him,\" answered the old man.    The servants said, \"Wait,\" and going in, they told Quetzalcoatl that an  old man wished to see him, adding, \"Sire, we put him out in vain; he  refuses to leave, and says that he absolutely must see you.\" Quetzalcoatl  answered:--    \"Let him in. I have been waiting his coming for a long time.\"    They admitted the old man and he entered the apartment of Quetzalcoatl,  and said to him:--    \"My lord and son, how are you? I have with me a medicine for you to  drink.\"    \"You are welcome, old man,\" replied Quetzalcoatl. \"I have been looking for  your arrival for many days.\"    \"Tell me how you are,\" asked the old man. \"How is your body and your  health?\"    \"I am very ill,\" answered Quetzalcoatl. \"My whole body pains me, and I  cannot move my hands or feet.\"    Then the old man said:--    \"Sire, look at this"]]]
