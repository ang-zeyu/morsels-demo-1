Any time  submarines are operating the airship can be available to seek them out.    Another result emerging from the fact of fleet operations was that  flying men and construction men, working together, became a closely knit  group. Engineers learned to fly ships, and flyers took their turn in the  shops. In building airships for the Navy, at the speed demanded by war  conditions, the control cars were built in the shop and the envelopes  cut out and fitted and cemented together in the balloon room. But  operating men, flyers and ground crew men, mechanics and riggers and  maintenance men took over from there, put the ships together--assembled  them, tested them out, delivered them to the Navy.        [Illustration: Lessons in streamlining gained from building and      flying blimps became useful when barrage balloons came into the      picture as a new defense weapon.]        [Illustration: The mooring mast made the blimps expeditionary craft,      eliminated the need for large ground crews, permitted more flying      days per month, increased safety.]        [Illustration: Floating Navy blimps and barrage balloons, with their      curious star-fish tails, give the service dock something of the      appearance of a giant aquarium.]        [Illustration: Principal use for the rigid airship in wartime is as      an airplane carrier, with half a dozen planes to extend its      reconnaissance range and determine the enemy's position.]    It was this co-ordination between men in green eye shades, working over  the drafting board and wind-tanned pilots, studying gray skies and  phosphorescent control boards, which enabled the organization to meet  the war emergency of large scale production of non-rigid airships.    There was another by-product result arising from the fact that the  company, even in the doldrum days, when there were few orders for ships,  had kept its engineers at work on research and its ships flying on  experimental missions. It all happened suddenly, a colorful circumstance  not often found in the sober humdrum of the business world.    A great plane manufacturer, having more defense work than its crowded  shops could handle, looked around for some company with experience in  the fabrication of light metal, to whom it could farm out some of the  details.    Goodyear Aircraft Corporation, the aeronautic subsidiary, was asked to  build tail surfaces for Martin bombers. A curious thing happened. Men  whose work had been primarily with airships, rather than airplanes  (omitting the quite different field of airplane tires, wheels, and  brakes) found themselves on familiar ground when they swung over to  heavier-than-air construction.    Here was the same problem of getting maximum strength with minimum  weight, of selection and treatment of light alloys, of intricate stress  calculations, and a hundred ingenious devices to measure those stresses,  enabling designers to turn out a scientifically designed structure. The  background was there--not to mention their experience and studies in  streamlined design--to reduce resistance, get maximum performance from  power plants.    The difference was that in the case of the airship savings in weight  mount fast, because of size. The importance of light weight and high  strength had come home to airship designers years before.    Their experience was directly applicable to the new field. Other orders  came in, from Curtiss, Consolidated, Grumman, and soon the huge plant  was humming with the production of parts for fighters and bombers.    Then a four-company arrangement was set up by the government to expand  airplane production still further, and after that an order for complete  planes. The original plant was now jam-packed with lathes and drills,  jigs and presses, and three huge new plants were built alongside and  across the road, and Goodyear Aircraft Corporation found itself with  thousands of men, building not only airships, but airplanes and airplane  parts as well.    Every large company took on new tasks in defense, but in this case  Goodyear was able to move quickly, and give unexpected support to the  airplane program by reason of its long research in a different field.  This result, it is true, grew chiefly out of research in rigid airships,  rather than non-rigids, but both played a part in another  instance--barrage balloons.    England was using them, might ask this country to supply some. The  American government too might have use for them. So, long before there  was even any hint of orders, Mr. Litchfield threw a new problem to the  engineers at Goodyear Aircraft and the operating men at Wingfoot  Lake--the job of designing an efficient barrage balloon. They were not  to make Chinese copies of foreign balloons, but draw on their experience  in lighter-than-air and see if principles and technique established  there could not be applied to design balloons which would ride with  maximum stability in gusty and unstable air. Men went to work,  designing, building, flying, observing, rejecting, altering, improving,  week after week, month after month, until several satisfactory types  were evolved. One of these was capable of flying at 15,000 feet, twice  the usual height. Orders began to come in, and the little group of men  and girls in the balloon room quickly grew into a large organization.  The department outgrew its quarters, took over room after room, expanded  to subsidiary plants outside Akron.    One instrument developed illustrates how the airship men were able to  utilize past experience in a new project.    Mounted alongside the winch on the ground, it gave exact information, as  often as was wanted, as to what the barrage balloon was doing, a mile or  three miles up.    This assembly included a moving picture camera, which continuously, or  at fixed intervals, or at any instant desired, by means of radio  control, would photograph recording dials and show these things: wind  velocity at the balloon, tension on cable, gas pressure inside the  balloon, temperature of confined gas, temperature and humidity of the  air surrounding the balloon, angle of attack at which the balloon faced  the wind, both fore and aft and from side to side, also a clock, which  showed the time the readings were recorded.    These pictures, when developed gave the engineers the data from which  they could modify designs and arrive at a type of balloon which would  ride most easily aloft, avoid undue tugging and surging on the  cable--incidentally permitting smaller gauge and weight cable to be used  for a given height with ample safety margin.    Perhaps the largest single result, however, growing out of the fleet  operations was that it had created manufacturing facilities, ships and  personnel on which the Navy could draw, as fully as it wanted, in  emergency, and with little more delay than the time it took for a man to  change his uniform.    Boettner, Sewell, Blair, Hobensack and Hill followed the others into the  service. Hobensack's ground crew in California signed up with him in a  body, and men from other ground crews, expert in rigging, in motors,  radio, in mooring out and maintenance joined up. In the end only Fickes  and Crum were left at Akron to build the new ships, and Sheppard,  Crosier and Massic to test-fly them, then ferry them to their  destinations.    The student pilots at Wingfoot Lake had finished their training just in  time. About half of them went immediately into the Navy, were  commissioned and sent to the various bases, the others remained at Akron  as replacements to the other pilots, in testing and delivery flights, or  on key posts in airship construction.    The experience accumulated by the blimp pilots under varying weather  conditions over the country proved useful to the Navy, particularly in  the expeditionary operations which coastal patrol would demand. It was  useful as well in helping train navy aviation cadets for the growing  airship fleet. Five of the pilots, Sewell, Boettner, Rieker, Stacy and  Smith had reached the rank of lieutenant commander by the end of 1942,  and Lange, full commander, had become commanding officer of a new Navy  station on the west coast. Two of the public relations men, Lieutenants  Petrie and Schetter, old airship troupers, followed the fliers into  uniform.    The airship service suffered its first casualty in 1942 when Lt.  Trotter, gallant and resourceful pilot of balloons and ships, was killed  in a collision, in which Lt. Comdr. Rounds also lost his life.    The Goodyear fleet passed out of existence with the war. The ships being  the same size as the Navy training ships, it was a simple matter to  change them over, paint the new name on their broad sides.    Facilities for ship construction became useful also in the new war. An  airship hangar is unlike any other structure in the world. It must be  broad and high and free of supporting girders. There were two large  airship docks at Akron, half a dozen smaller ones over the country. At  hand, too, was equipment for helium purification and storage, along with  radio and weather gear, mobile mooring masts and other specialized  equipment which only lighter-than-air uses. There was the balloon room,  too, with a wealth of experience dating back to the first World War, and  which with new jobs like building barrage balloons, rubber rafts and  assault boats grew to large dimension.    Wingfoot Lake was more than doubled in size, and the large airship dock,  occupied at first by heavier-than-air production, had to be changed back  later for airship assembly, to meet the Navy's mounting demands for  ships.

Responding under the same mask adopted by this knavish  elder, I said, \"The chief of Kingaru has called me a rich sultan. If I  am a rich sultan why comes not the chief with a rich present to me, that  he might get a rich return?\" Said he, with another leer of his wrinkled  visage, \"Kingaru is poor, there is no matama in the village.\" To which  I replied that since there was no matama in the village I would pay him  half a shukka, or a yard of cloth, which would be exactly equivalent to  his present; that if he preferred to call his small basketful a present,  I should be content to call my yard of cloth a present. With which logic  he was fain to be satisfied.    April 1st.--To-day the Expedition suffered a loss in the death of the  grey Arab horse presented by Seyd Burghash, Sultan of Zanzibar. The  night previous I had noticed that the horse was suffering. Bearing in  mind what has been so frequently asserted, namely, that no horses could  live in the interior of Africa because of the tsetse, I had him opened,  and the stomach, which I believed to be diseased, examined. Besides much  undigested matama and grass there were found twenty-five short, thick,  white worms, sticking like leeches into the coating of the stomach,  while the intestines were almost alive with the numbers of long white  worms. I was satisfied that neither man nor beast could long exist with  such a mass of corrupting life within him.    In order that the dead carcase might not taint the valley, I had it  buried deep in the ground, about a score of yards from the encampment.  From such a slight cause ensued a tremendous uproar from Kingaru--chief  of the village--who, with his brother-chiefs of neighbouring villages,  numbering in the aggregate two dozen wattled huts, had taken counsel  upon the best means of mulcting the Musungu of a full doti or two of  Merikani, and finally had arrived at the conviction that the act of  burying a dead horse in their soil without \"By your leave, sir,\" was  a grievous and fineable fault. Affecting great indignation at the  unpardonable omission, he, Kingaru, concluded to send to the Musungu  four of his young men to say to him that \"since you have buried your  horse in my ground, it is well; let him remain there; but you must pay  me two doti of Merikani.\" For reply the messengers were told to say to  the chief that I would prefer talking the matter over with himself face  to face, if he would condescend to visit me in my tent once again. As  the village was but a stone's throw from our encampment, before many  minutes had elapsed the wrinkled elder made his appearance at the door  of my tent with about half the village behind him.    The following dialogue which took place will serve to illustrate the  tempers of the people with whom I was about to have a year's trading  intercourse:    White Man.--\"Are you the great chief of Kingaru?\"    Kingaru.--\"Huh-uh. Yes.\"    W. M.--\"The great, great chief?\"    Kingaru.--\"Huh-uh. Yes.\"    W. M.--\"How many soldiers have you?\"    Kingaru.--\" Why?\"    W. M.--\"How many fighting men have you?\"    Kingaru.--\"None.\"    W. M.--\"Oh! I thought you might have a thousand men with you, by your  going to fine a strong white man, who has plenty of guns and soldiers,  two doti for burying a dead horse.\"    Kingaru (rather perplexed).--\"No; I have no soldiers. I have only a few  young men.\"    W. M.--\"Why do you come and make trouble, then?\"    Kingaru.--\"It was not I; it was my brothers who said to me, 'Come here,  come here, Kingaru, see what the white man has done! Has he not taken  possession of your soil, in that he has put his horse into your ground  without your permission? Come, go to him and see by what right.'  Therefore have I come to ask you, who gave you permission to use my soil  for a burying-ground?\"    W. M. \"I want no man's permission to do what is right. My horse died;  had I left him to fester and stink in your valley, sickness would visit  your village, your water would become unwholesome, and caravans would  not stop here for trade; for they would say, 'This is an unlucky spot,  let us go away.' But enough said: I understand you to say that you do  not want him buried in your ground; the error I have fallen into is  easily put right. This minute my soldiers shall dig him out again, and  cover up the soil as it was before; and the horse shall be left where he  died.\" (Then shouting to Bombay.) \"Ho! Bombay, take soldiers with jembes  to dig my horse out of the ground, drag him to where he died, and make  everything ready for a march to-morrow morning.\"    Kingaru, his voice considerably higher, and his head moving to and fro  with emotion, cries out, \"Akuna, akuna, bana!\"--\"No, no, master! Let not  the white man get angry. The horse is dead, and now lies buried; let him  remain so, since he is already there, and let us be friends again.\"    The Sheikh of Kingaru being thus brought to his senses, we bid each  other the friendly \"Kwaheri,\" and I was left alone to ruminate over my  loss. Barely half an hour had elapsed, it was 9 P.M., the camp was in  a semi-doze, when I heard deep groans issuing from one of the animals.  Upon inquiry as to what animal was suffering, I was surprised to hear  that it was my bay horse. With a bull's-eye lantern, I visited him, and  perceived that the pain was located in the stomach, but whether it was  from some poisonous plant he had eaten while out grazing, or from some  equine disease, I did not know. He discharged copious quantities of  loose matter, but there was nothing peculiar in its colour. The pain was  evidently very great, for his struggles were very violent. I was up all  night, hoping that it was but a temporary effect of some strange and  noxious plant; but at 6 o'clock the next morning, after a short period  of great agony, he also died; exactly fifteen hours after his companion.  When the stomach was opened, it was found that death was caused by the  internal rupture of a large cancer, which had affected the larger half  of the coating of his stomach, and had extended an inch or two up the  larynx. The contents of the stomach and intestines were deluged with the  yellow viscous efflux from the cancer.    I was thus deprived of both my horses, and that within the short space  of fifteen hours. With my limited knowledge of veterinary science,  however, strengthened by the actual and positive proofs obtained by the  dissection of the two stomachs, I can scarcely state that horses can  live to reach Unyanyembe, or that they can travel with ease through this  part of East Africa. But should I have occasion at some future day,  I should not hesitate to take four horses with me, though I should  certainly endeavour to ascertain previous to purchase whether they, were  perfectly sound and healthy, and to those travellers who cherish a good  horse I would say, \"Try one,\" and be not discouraged by my unfortunate  experiences.    The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of April passed, and nothing had we heard or  seen of the ever-lagging fourth caravan. In the meanwhile the list of  casualties was being augmented. Besides the loss of this precious time,  through the perverseness of the chief of the other caravan, and the  loss of my two horses, a pagazi carrying boat-fixtures improved the  opportunity, and deserted. Selim was struck down with a severe attack  of ague and fever, and was soon after followed by the cook, then by the  assistant cook and tailor, Abdul Kader. Finally, before the third day  was over, Bombay had rheumatism, Uledi (Grant's old valet) had a swollen  throat, Zaidi had the flux, Kingaru had the mukunguru; Khamisi, a  pagazi, suffered from a weakness of the loins; Farjalla had a bilious  fever; and before night closed Makoviga was very ill. Out of a force of  twenty-five men one had deserted, and ten were on the sick list, and the  presentiment that the ill-looking neighbourhood of Kingaru would prove  calamitous to me was verified.    On the 4th April Maganga and his people appeared, after being heralded  by musketry-shots and horn-blowing, the usual signs of an approaching  caravan in this land. His sick men were considerably improved, but they  required one more day of rest at Kingaru. In the afternoon he came to  lay siege to my generosity, by giving details of Soor Hadji Palloo's  heartless cheats upon him; but I informed him, that since I had left  Bagamoyo, I could no longer be generous; we were now in a land where  cloth was at a high premium; that I had no more cloth than I should need  to furnish food for myself and men; that he and his caravan had cost me  more money and trouble than any three caravans I had, as indeed was the  case. With this counter-statement he was obliged to be content. But I  again solved his pecuniary doubts by promising that, if he hurried his  caravan on to Unyanyembe, he should have no cause of complaint.    The 5th of April saw the fourth caravan vanish for once in our front,  with a fair promise that, however fast we should follow, we should not  see them the hither side of Sinbamwenni.    The following morning, in order to rouse my people from the sickened  torpitude they had lapsed into, I beat an exhilarating alarum on a  tin pan with an iron ladle, intimating that a sofari was about to be  undertaken. This had a very good effect, judging from the extraordinary  alacrity with which it was responded to. Before the sun rose we started.  The Kingaru villagers were out with the velocity of hawks for any rags  or refuse left behind us.    The long march to Imbiki, fifteen miles, proved that our protracted stay  at Kingaru had completely demoralized my soldiers and pagazis. Only  a few of them had strength enough to reach Imbiki before night. The  others, attending the laden donkeys, put in an appearance next morning,  in a lamentable state of mind and body.
