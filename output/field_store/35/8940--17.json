Then he ordained provosts and masters over them to set them  awork and put them to affliction of burdens. They builded to Pharaoh two  towns, Pithom and Raamses. How much more they oppressed them, so much  the more they increased and multiplied. The Egyptians hated the children  of Israel and put them to affliction, scorning and having envy at them,  and oppressed bitterly their life with hard work and sore labors of  tile and clay, and grieved all them in such works. Then Pharaoh  commanded to his people saying: Whatsomever is born of males cast ye  into the river, and what of women keep ye them and let ye them live.    After this was a man of the house of Levi went out and took a wife of  his kindred, which conceived and brought forth a son, and he saw him  elegant and fair, and hid him three months, and when he might no longer  hide him, took a little crib of rushes and wickers and pitched it with  glue and pitch, and put therein the child, and set it on the river, and  let it drive down in the stream, and the sister of the child standing  afar, considering what should fall thereof. And it happed that same  time, the daughter of king Pharaoh descended down to the river for to  wash her in the water, and her maidens went by the brink, which then,  when she saw the little crib or fiscelle she sent one of her maidens to  fetch and take it up, which so fetched and brought to her, and she saw  therein lying a fair child; and she having pity on it said: This is one  of the children of the Hebrews. To whom anon spake the sister of the  child: Wilt thou, said she, that I go and call thee a woman of the  Hebrews that shall and may nourish this child? She answered: Go thy way.  The maid went and called his mother, to whom Pharaoh's daughter said:  Take this child and nourish him to me, and I shall give to thee thy meed  and reward. The mother took her child and nourished it, and when it was  weaned and could go she delivered it to the daughter of king Pharaoh,  whom she received and adopted instead of a son and named him Moses,  saying that I took him out of the water. And he there grew and waxed a  pretty child. And as Josephus, Antiquitatum, saith: This daughter of  Pharaoh, which was named Termuthe, loved well Moses and reputed him as  her son by adoption, and on a day brought him to her father, who for his  beauty took him in his arms and made much of him, and set his diadem on  his head, wherein was his idol. And Moses anon took it, and cast it  under his feet and trod on it, wherefore the king was wroth, and  demanded of the great doctors and magicians what should fall of this  child. And they kalked on his nativity and said: This is he that shall  destroy thy reign and put it under foot, and shall rule and govern the  Hebrews. Wherefore the king anon decreed that he should be put to death.  But others said that Moses did it of childhood and ought not to die  therefore, and counselled to make thereof a proof, and so they did.    They set tofore him a platter full of coals burning, and a platter full  of cherries, and bade him eat, and he took and put the hot coals in his  mouth and burned his tongue, which letted his speech ever after; and  thus he escaped the death. Josephus saith that when Pharaoh would have  slain him, Termuthe, his daughter, plucked him away and saved him. Then  on a time as Moses was full grown, he went to his brethren, and saw the  affliction of them, and a man of Egypt smiting one of the Hebrews, his  brethren. And he looked hither and thither and saw no man. He smote the  Egyptian and slew him and hid him in the sand. And another day he went  out and found two of the Hebrews brawling and fighting together; then he  said to him that did wrong: Why smitest thou thy neighbor? which  answered: Who hath ordained thee prince and judge upon us? wilt thou  slay me as thou slewest that other day an Egyptian? Moses was afeard and  said to himself: How is this deed known and made open? Pharaoh heard  hereof and sought Moses for to slay him, which then fled from his sight  and dwelled in the land of Midian, and sat there by a pit side. The  priest of Midian had seven daughters which came thither for to draw  water, and to fill the vessels for to give drink to the flocks of the  sheep of their father. Then came on them the herdmen and put them from  it. Then rose Moses and defended the maidens and let them water their  sheep, which then returned to their father Jethro. And he said to them:  Why come ye now earlier than ye were wont to do? They said that a man of  Egypt hath delivered us from the hand of the herdmen, and also he drew  water for us and gave to the sheep drink. Where is he, said he, why left  ye the man after you? go call him that he may eat some bread with us.  Then Moses sware that he would dwell with him. And he took Zipporah one  of his daughters aad wedded her to his wife, which conceived and bare  him a son whom he called Gershom, saying: I was a stranger in a strange  land. She brought to him forth another son whom he named Eleazar,  saying: The God of my father is my helper and hath kept me from the  hand of Pharaoh.    Long time after this died the king of Egypt, and the children of Israel,  wailing, made great sorrow for the oppression of their labor, and cried  unto God for help. Their cry came unto God of their works, and God heard  their wailing, and remembered the promise he made with Abraham, Isaac,  and Jacob, and our Lord beheld the children of Israel and knew them.    Moses fed the sheep of Jethro his wife's father. When he had brought the  sheep into the innermost part of the desert he came unto the mount of  God, Oreb. Our Lord appeared to him in flame of fire in the midst of a  bush, and he saw the fire in the bush, and the bush burned not. Then  said Moses, I shall go and see this great vision why the bush burneth  not. Our Lord then beholding that he went for to see it, called him,  being in the bush, and said: Moses, Moses, which answered: I am here.  Then said our Lord: Approach no nearer hitherward. Take off thy shoon  from thy feet, the place that thou standest on is holy ground. And said  also: I am God of thy fathers, God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God  of Jacob. Moses then hid his face, and durst not look toward God. To  whom God said: I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I  have heard their cry of the hardness that they suffer in their works,  and I knowing the sorrow of them am descended to deliver them from the  hand of the Egyptians, and shall lead them from this land into a good  land and spacious, into a land that floweth milk and honey, unto the  places of Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and  Jebusites. The cry of the children of Israel is come to me, I have seen  their affliction, how they be oppressed of the Egyptians. But come to me  and I shall send thee unto Pharaoh that thou shalt lead the children of  Israel out of Egypt. Then Moses said to him: Who am I that shall go to  Pharaoh and lead the children out of Egypt? To whom God said: I shall be  with thee, and this shall be the sign that I send thee. When thou shalt  have led out my people of Egypt, thou shalt offer to God upon this hill.  Moses said unto God: Lo! if I go to the children of Israel and say to  them: God of your fathers hath sent me to you; if they say: What is his  name? what shall I say? Our Lord said to Moses: I am that I am. He said:  Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: He that is, sent me to  you, and yet shalt thou say to them: The Lord God of your fathers, God  of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, hath appeared to me saying:  This is my name for evermore, and this is my memorial from generation to  generation. Go and gather together the seniors and aged men of Israel,  and say to them: The Lord God of your fathers hath appeared to me, God  of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, saying: Visiting I have  visited you, and have seen all that is fallen in Egypt, and I shall lead  you out of the affliction of Egypt into the land of Canaan, Ethei, etc.,  unto the land flowing milk and honey, and they shall hear thy voice.  Thou shalt go and take with thee the seniors of Israel to the king of  Egypt, and shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews hath called us;  we shall go the journey of three days in wilderness that we may offer to  our Lord God. But I know well that the king of Egypt shall not suffer  you to go but by strong hand. I shall stretch out my hand and shall  smite Egypt in all my marvels that I shall do amid among them. After  that he shall let you go. I shall then give my grace to this people  tofore the Egyptians, and when ye shall go out ye shall not depart void,  nor with nought, but every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of  her hostess, vessels of silver and of gold, and clothes, and them shall  ye lay on your sons, and on your daughters, and ye shall rob Egypt. Then  Moses answered and said: They shall not believe me ne hear my voice, but  shall say: God hath not appeared to thee.    God said then to him: What is that thou holdest in thine hand? He  answered: A rod. Our Lord said: Cast it on the ground. He threw it down  and it turned into a serpent, whereof Moses was afeard and would have  fled. Our Lord said to him: Put forth thy hand and hold him by the tail;  he stretched forth his hand and held him, and it turned again into a  rod. To this, that they believe thee, that I have appeared to thee. And  yet our Lord said to him: Put thy hand into thy bosom, which, when he  hath put in, and drawn out again, it was like a leper's hand. Our Lord  bade him to withdraw it into his bosom again, and he drew it out and it  was then like that other flesh.

The scavenger beetle is one of the most useful of all insects, as it  effectually answers the object indicated by the name. Where they abound,  as at Kuruman, the villages are sweet and clean, for no sooner are  animal excretions dropped than, attracted by the scent, the scavengers  are heard coming booming up the wind. They roll away the droppings of  cattle at once, in round pieces often as large as billiard-balls; and  when they reach a place proper by its softness for the deposit of their  eggs and the safety of their young, they dig the soil out from beneath  the ball till they have quite let it down and covered it: they then lay  their eggs within the mass. While the larvae are growing, they devour  the inside of the ball before coming above ground to begin the world for  themselves. The beetles with their gigantic balls look like Atlas with  the world on his back; only they go backward, and, with their heads  down, push with the hind legs, as if a boy should roll a snow-ball with  his legs while standing on his head. As we recommend the eland to John  Bull, and the gigantic frog to France, we can confidently recommend this  beetle to the dirty Italian towns and our own Sanitary Commissioners.    In trying to benefit the tribes living under the Boers of the Cashan  Mountains, I twice performed a journey of about three hundred miles to  the eastward of Kolobeng. Sechele had become so obnoxious to the Boers  that, though anxious to accompany me in my journey, he dared not  trust himself among them. This did not arise from the crime of  cattle-stealing; for that crime, so common among the Caffres, was never  charged against his tribe, nor, indeed, against any Bechuana tribe. It  is, in fact, unknown in the country, except during actual warfare. His  independence and love of the English were his only faults. In my last  journey there, of about two hundred miles, on parting at the River  Marikwe he gave me two servants, \"to be,\" as he said, \"his arms to serve  me,\" and expressed regret that he could not come himself. \"Suppose we  went north,\" I said, \"would you come?\" He then told me the story  of Sebituane having saved his life, and expatiated on the far-famed  generosity of that really great man. This was the first time I had  thought of crossing the Desert to Lake Ngami.    The conduct of the Boers, who, as will be remembered, had sent a letter  designed to procure my removal out of the country, and their well-known  settled policy which I have already described, became more fully  developed on this than on any former occasion. When I spoke to Mr.  Hendrick Potgeiter of the danger of hindering the Gospel of Christ among  these poor savages, he became greatly excited, and called one of his  followers to answer me. He threatened to attack any tribe that might  receive a native teacher, yet he promised to use his influence to  prevent those under him from throwing obstacles in our way. I could  perceive plainly that nothing more could be done in that direction, so I  commenced collecting all the information I could about the desert, with  the intention of crossing it, if possible. Sekomi, the chief of the  Bamangwato, was acquainted with a route which he kept carefully to  himself, because the Lake country abounded in ivory, and he drew large  quantities thence periodically at but small cost to himself.    Sechele, who valued highly every thing European, and was always fully  alive to his own interest, was naturally anxious to get a share of that  inviting field. He was most anxious to visit Sebituane too, partly,  perhaps, from a wish to show off his new acquirements, but chiefly, I  believe, from having very exalted ideas of the benefits he would derive  from the liberality of that renowned chieftain. In age and family  Sechele is the elder and superior of Sekomi; for when the original  tribe broke up into Bamangwato, Bangwaketse, and Bakwains, the Bakwains  retained the hereditary chieftainship; so their chief, Sechele,  possesses certain advantages over Sekomi, the chief of the Bamangwato.  If the two were traveling or hunting together, Sechele would take, by  right, the heads of the game shot by Sekomi.    There are several vestiges, besides, of very ancient partitions and  lordships of tribes. The elder brother of Sechele's father, becoming  blind, gave over the chieftainship to Sechele's father. The descendants  of this man pay no tribute to Sechele, though he is the actual ruler,  and superior to the head of that family; and Sechele, while in every  other respect supreme, calls him Kosi, or Chief. The other tribes will  not begin to eat the early pumpkins of a new crop until they hear that  the Bahurutse have \"bitten it\", and there is a public ceremony on the  occasion--the son of the chief being the first to taste of the new  harvest.    Sechele, by my advice, sent men to Sekomi, asking leave for me to pass  along his path, accompanying the request with the present of an ox.  Sekomi's mother, who possesses great influence over him, refused  permission, because she had not been propitiated. This produced a  fresh message; and the most honorable man in the Bakwain tribe, next to  Sechele, was sent with an ox for both Sekomi and his mother. This, too,  was met by refusal. It was said, \"The Matebele, the mortal enemies of  the Bechuanas, are in the direction of the lake, and, should they kill  the white man, we shall incur great blame from all his nation.\"    The exact position of the Lake Ngami had, for half a century at least,  been correctly pointed out by the natives, who had visited it when rains  were more copious in the Desert than in more recent times, and many  attempts had been made to reach it by passing through the Desert in the  direction indicated; but it was found impossible, even for Griquas,  who, having some Bushman blood in them, may be supposed more capable of  enduring thirst than Europeans. It was clear, then, that our only chance  of success was by going round, instead of through, the Desert. The best  time for the attempt would have been about the end of the rainy season,  in March or April, for then we should have been likely to meet with  pools of rain-water, which always dry up during the rainless winter. I  communicated my intention to an African traveler, Colonel Steele, then  aid-de-camp to the Marquis of Tweedale at Madras, and he made it known  to two other gentlemen, whose friendship we had gained during their  African travel, namely, Major Vardon and Mr. Oswell. All of these  gentlemen were so enamored with African hunting and African discovery  that the two former must have envied the latter his good fortune in  being able to leave India to undertake afresh the pleasures and pains of  desert life. I believe Mr. Oswell came from his high position at a very  considerable pecuniary sacrifice, and with no other end in view but to  extend the boundaries of geographical knowledge. Before I knew of his  coming, I had arranged that the payment for the guides furnished by  Sechele should be the loan of my wagon, to bring back whatever ivory he  might obtain from the chief at the lake. When, at last, Mr. Oswell came,  bringing Mr. Murray with him, he undertook to defray the entire expenses  of the guides, and fully executed his generous intention.    Sechele himself would have come with us, but, fearing that the  much-talked-of assault of the Boers might take place during our absence,  and blame be attached to me for taking him away, I dissuaded him against  it by saying that he knew Mr. Oswell \"would be as determined as himself  to get through the Desert.\"    Before narrating the incidents of this journey, I may give some account  of the great Kalahari Desert, in order that the reader may understand in  some degree the nature of the difficulties we had to encounter.    The space from the Orange River in the south, lat. 29 Degrees, to Lake  Ngami in the north, and from about 24 Degrees east long. to near the  west coast, has been called a desert simply because it contains no  running water, and very little water in wells. It is by no means  destitute of vegetation and inhabitants, for it is covered with grass  and a great variety of creeping plants; besides which there are  large patches of bushes, and even trees. It is remarkably flat, but  interesected in different parts by the beds of ancient rivers; and  prodigious herds of certain antelopes, which require little or no water,  roam over the trackless plains. The inhabitants, Bushmen and Bakalahari,  prey on the game and on the countless rodentia and small species of  the feline race which subsist on these. In general, the soil is  light-colored soft sand, nearly pure silica. The beds of the ancient  rivers contain much alluvial soil; and as that is baked hard by the  burning sun, rain-water stands in pools in some of them for several  months in the year.    The quantity of grass which grows on this remarkable region is  astonishing, even to those who are familiar with India. It usually rises  in tufts with bare spaces between, or the intervals are occupied by  creeping plants, which, having their roots buried far beneath the soil,  feel little the effects of the scorching sun. The number of these which  have tuberous roots is very great; and their structure is intended to  supply nutriment and moisture, when, during the long droughts, they  can be obtained nowhere else. Here we have an example of a plant, not  generally tuber-bearing, becoming so under circumstances where that  appendage is necessary to act as a reservoir for preserving its life;  and the same thing occurs in Angola to a species of grape-bearing vine,  which is so furnished for the same purpose. The plant to which I  at present refer is one of the cucurbitaceae, which bears a small,  scarlet-colored, eatable cucumber. Another plant, named"]]]
