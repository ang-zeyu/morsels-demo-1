Amidst the pangs of such intestine strife,    Still think the present day the last of life;    Defer not 'till to-morrow to be wise,    To-morrow's sun to thee may never rise;    Or shou'd to-morrow chance to chear thy sight,    With her enliv'ning, and unlook'd-for light.    How grateful will appear her dawning rays!    Its favours unexpected doubly please.    Who thus can think, and who such thoughts pursues,    Content may keep his life, or calmly lose.    All proofs of this, thou may'st thyself receive,    When leisure from affairs will give thee leave.    Come, see thy friend retir'd, without regret,    Forgetting care, or striving to forget,    In easy contemplation, soothing time    With morals much, and now and then with rhyme;    Not so robust in body as in mind,    And always undejected, tho' declin'd;    Not wond'ring at the world's new wicked ways,    Compar'd with those of our fore-father's days:    For virtue now is neither more or less,    And vice is only vary'd in the dress:    Believe it, men have ever been the same,    And OVID'S GOLDEN AGE is but a dream.    We shall conclude the life of this eminent wit, with the testimony  of Mr. Pope in his favour, from the close of his postscript to the  translation of Homer: It is in every respect so honourable, that  it would be injurious to Mr. Congreve to omit it.--His words  are--'Instead of endeavouring to raise a vain monument to myself, let  me leave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one of the most  valuable men, as well as the finest writers of my age and country.  One who has tried, and knows by his own experience, how hard an  undertaking it is to do justice to Homer, and one who I'm sure  sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my labours. To him  therefore, having brought this long work to a conclusion, I desire to  dedicate it, and have the honour and satisfaction of placing together  in this manner, the names of Mr. Congreve and of    A. POPE.      [Footnote A: General Dictionary.]    [Footnote B: Wilson's Memoirs of Congreve.]    [Footnote C: Yet Maskwell purposely talks to himself, designing to be  overheard by Lord Touchwood; undoubtedly an error in the conduit, and  want of art in the author. This he seems here to forget, or would not  remember it.]           *       *       *       *       *          Sir JOHN VANBRUGH,      This Gentleman was descended from an antient family in Cheshire, which  came originally from France; though by the name it would appear to be  of Dutch extraction. He received a very liberal education, and became  eminent for his poetry, and skill in architecture, to both which  he discovered an early propension. It is somewhat remarkable in  the History of Poetry, that when the spirit of Tragedy, in a great  measure, declined, when Otway and Lee were dead, and Dryden was  approaching to old age, that Comedy should then begin to flourish; at  an AEra, which one would not have expected to prove auspicious to the  cause of mirth.    Much about the same time rose Mr. Congreve, and Sir John Vanbrugh;  who, without any invidious reflection on the genius of others, gave  a new life to the stage, and restored it to reputation, which before  their appearance had been for some time sinking. Happy would it have  been for the world, and some advantage to the memory of those comic  writers, if they had discovered their wit, without any mixture of  that licentiousness, which while it pleased, tended to corrupt  the audience. The first step our author made into life, was in the  character of an ensign in the army. He was possessed of a very ready  wit, and an agreeable elocution. He happened somewhere in his winter  quarters, to contract an acquaintance with Sir Thomas Skipwith,  and received a particular obligation from him. He had very early  discovered a taste for dramatic writing, to improve which he made  some attempts in that way, and had the draft or out-lines of two plays  lying by him, at the time his acquaintance commenced with Sir Thomas.  This gentleman possessed a large share in a Theatrical Patent, though  he very little concerned himself in the conduct of it; but that  he might not appear altogether remiss, he thought to procure some  advantage to the stage, by having our author's play, called the  Relapse, to be acted upon it. In this he was not disappointed, for  the Relapse succeeded beyond the warmest expectation, and raised  Vanbrugh's name very high amongst the writers for the stage.    Tho' this play met with greater applause, than the author expected,  yet it was not without its enemies. These were people of the graver  sort, who blamed the looseness of the scenes, and the unguarded  freedom of the dialect. These complaints induced Vanbrugh to make some  observations upon them in his preface, which he thus begins, 'To go  about to excuse half the defects this abortive brat is come into the  world with, would be to provoke the town with a long useless preface,  when 'tis, I doubt, sufficiently sour'd already, by a tedious play.    'I do therefore, with all the humility of a repenting sinner, confess  it wants every thing--but length, and in that I hope the severest  critics will be pleased to acknowledge, I have not been wanting. But  my modesty will sure attone for every thing, when the world shall know  it is so great, I am even to this day insensible of those two shining  graces, in the play (which some part of the town is pleased to  compliment me with) blasphemy and bawdy. For my part I cannot find  them out; if there were any obscene expressions upon the stage,  here they are in print; for I have dealt fairly, I have not sunk a  syllable, that could be ranged under that head, and yet I believe with  a steady faith, there is not one woman of real reputation in town, but  when she has read it impartially over in her closet, will find it so  innocent, she'll think it no affront to her prayer book, to lay it  upon the same shelf.'    Being encouraged by the success of the Relapse, he yielded to the  sollicitation of lord Hallifax, who had read some of the loose sheets  of his Provok'd Wife, to finish that piece; and after throwing  them into a proper form, gave the play to the Theatre in  Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. Though Sir John had a greater inclination to  serve the other company, yet the request of lord Hallifax, so eminent  a patron of the poets, could not be resisted. Sir Thomas Skipwith was  not offended at so reasonable a compliance, and the Provok'd Wife was  acted 1698, with success. Some critics likewise objected against this,  as a loose performance; and that it taught the married women how to  revenge themselves on their husbands, who should offend them.    The play has indeed this moral, that such husbands as resemble Sir  John Brute, may expect that neglected beauty, and abused virtue, may  be provoked to yield to the motives of revenge, and that the forcible  sollicitations of an agreeable person, who not only demonstrates  a value, but a passion for what the possessor slights, may be  sufficiently prevalent with an injured wife to forfeit her honour.    Though this event may often fall out, that the brutality of a husband  produces the infidelity of a wife, yet it need not be shewn upon the  stage; women are not generally so tame in their natures, as to bear  neglect with patience, and the natural resentments of the human  heart will without any other monitor point out the method of revenge.  Besides, every husband ought not to be deemed a brute, because a too  delicate, or ceremonious wife, shall, in the abundance of her caprice,  bestow upon him that appellation. Many women who have beheld this  representation, may have been stimulated to imitate lady Brute in her  method of revenge, without having suffered her provocation. This play  verifies the observation of Mr. Pope,      That Van wants grace, who never wanted wit.    The next play which Sir John Vanbrugh introduced upon the stage  was Aesop, a Comedy; in two Parts, acted at the Theatre-Royal in  Drury-Lane 1698. This was originally written in French, by Mr.  Boursart, about six years before; but the scenes of Sir Polidorus  Hogstye, the Players, the Senator, and the Beau, were added by our  author. This performance contains a great deal of general satire,  and useful morality; notwithstanding which, it met with but a cold  reception from the audience, and its run terminated in about 8 or 9  days. This seemed the more surprising to men of taste, as the French  comedy from which it was taken, was played to crowded audiences for  a month together. Sir John has rather improved upon the original by  adding new scenes, than suffered it to be diminished in a translation,  but the French and the English. taste was in that particular very  different. We cannot better account for the ill success of this  excellent piece, than in the words of Mr. Cibber's Apology for his own  Life, when speaking of this play, he has the following observation;  'The character that delivers precepts of wisdom, is, in some sort,  severe upon the auditor, for shewing him one wiser than himself; but  when folly is his object, he applauds himself for being wiser than the  coxcomb he laughs at, and who is not more pleased with an occasion to  commend, than to accuse himself?'    Sir John Vanbrugh, it is said, had great facility in writing, and is  not a little to be admired for the spirit, ease, and readiness,  with which he produced his plays. Notwithstanding his extraordinary  expedition, there is a clear and lively simplicity in his wit, that  is equally distant from the pedantry of learning, and the lowness of  scurrility. As the face of a fine lady, with her hair undressed, may  appear in the morning in its brightest glow of beauty; such were the  productions of Vanbrugh, adorned with only the negligent graces of  nature.    Mr. Cibber observes, that there is something so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12019"],[0,"Queen Hortense: A Life Picture of the Napoleonic Era (#16)"],[1,"made known to her, nor had she deemed any  defence or proof of her innocence at all necessary. She felt that there  were certain accusations against which to even undertake defence is to  admit their possibility, and which, therefore, could only be combated by  silence. The slanders that had been flung at her lay in a plane so far  beneath her, that they could not rise high enough to reach her, but fell  powerless at her feet, whence she did not deem it even worth her while  to thrust them.    But Bonaparte continued to feel outraged and wounded by this vile story,  and it annoyed him deeply to learn that these rumors were still spread  abroad, and that his foes still bestirred themselves to keep him ever on  the alert, and, if possible, to dim the lustre of his gloriously-won  laurels by the shadow of an infamous crime.    \"There are still rumors abroad of a _liaison_ between me and Hortense,\"  said he one day to Bourrienne. \"They have even invented the most  repulsive stories concerning her first infant. At the time, I thought  that these calumnies were circulated among the public because the  latter go earnestly desired that I might have a child to inherit my  name. But it is still spoken of, is it not?\"    \"Yes, general, it is still spoken of; and I confess that I did not  believe this calumny would be so long continued.\"    \"This is really abominable!\" exclaimed Bonaparte, his eyes flashing with  anger. \"You, Bourrienne, you best know what truth there is in it. You  have heard and seen all; not the smallest circumstance could escape you.  You were her confidant in her love-affair with Duroc. I expect you to  clear me of this infamous reproach if you should some day write my  history. Posterity shall not associate my name with such infamy. I shall  depend on you, Bourrienne, and you will at least admit that you have  never believed in this abominable calumny?\"    \"No, never, general.\"    \"I shall rely on you, Bourrienne, not only on my own account, but for  the sake of poor Hortense. She is, without this, unhappy enough, as is  my brother also. I am concerned about this, because I love them both,  and because this very circumstance gives color to the reports which idle  chatterboxes have circulated regarding my relations to her. Therefore,  bear this in mind when you write of me hereafter.\"    \"I shall do so, general; I shall tell the truth, but, unfortunately, I  can not compel the world to believe the truth.\"    Bourrienne has, at all events, kept his word, and spoken the truth.  With deep indignation he spurns the calumny with which it has been  attempted to sully the memory of Bonaparte and Hortense, even down to  our time; and, in his anger, he even forgets the elegant and considerate  language of the courteous diplomat, which is elsewhere always  characteristic of his writings.    \"He lies in his throat,\" says Bourrienne, \"who asserts that Bonaparte  entertained other feelings for Hortense than those a step-father should  entertain for his step-daughter! Hortense entertained for the first  consul a feeling of reverential fear. She always spoke to him  tremblingly. She never ventured to approach him with a petition. She was  in the habit of coming to me, and I then submitted her wishes; and only  when Bonaparte received them unfavorably did I mention the name of the  petitioner. 'The silly thing!' said the first consul; 'why does she not  speak to me herself? Is she afraid of me?' Napoleon always entertained a  fatherly affection for her; since his marriage, he loved her as a father  would have loved his child. I, who for years was a witness of her  actions in the most private relations of life, I declare that I have  never seen or heard the slightest circumstance that would tend to  convict her of a criminal intimacy. One must consider this calumny as  belonging to the category of those which malice so willingly circulates  about those persons whose career has been brilliant, and which credulity  and envy so willingly believe. I declare candidly that, if I entertained  the slightest doubt with regard to this horrible calumny, I would say  so. But Bonaparte is no more! Impartial history must not and shall not  give countenance to this reproach; she should not make of a father and  friend a libertine! Malicious and hostile authors have asserted,  without, however, adducing any proof, that a criminal intimacy existed  between Bonaparte and Hortense. A falsehood, an unworthy falsehood! And  this report has been generally current, not only in France, but  throughout all Europe. Alas! can it, then, be true that calumny  exercises so mighty a charm that, when it has once taken possession of a  man, he can never be freed from it again?\"        CHAPTER V.    KING OR EMPEROR.    Josephine's entreaties had been fruitless, or Bonaparte had, at least,  only yielded to them in their literal sense. She had said: \"I entreat  you, do not make yourself a king!\" Bonaparte did not make himself king,  he made himself emperor. He did not take up the crown that had fallen  from the head of the Bourbons; he created a new one for himself--a crown  which the French people and Senate had, however, offered him. The  revolution still stood a threatening spectre behind the French people;  its return was feared, and, since the discovery of the conspiracy of  Georges, Moreau, and Pichegru, the people anxiously asked themselves  what was to become of France if the conspirators should succeed in  murdering Bonaparte; and when the republic should again be sent adrift,  without a pilot, on the wild sea of revolution. The people demanded that  their institutions should be securely established and maintained, and  believed that this could only be accomplished by a dynasty--by a  monarchical form of government. The consulate for life must therefore be  changed into an hereditary empire. Had not Bonaparte himself said: \"One  can be emperor of a republic, but not king of a republic; these two  terms are incompatible!\" They desired to make Napoleon emperor, because  they flattered themselves that in so doing they should still be able to  preserve the republic.    On the 18th of May, of the year 1804, the plan that had been so long and  carefully prepared was carried into execution. On the 18th of May, the  Senate repaired to St. Cloud, to entreat Bonaparte, in the name of the  people and army, to accept the imperial dignity, and exchange the Roman  chair of a consul for the French throne of an emperor.    Cambaceres, the late second consul of the republic, stood at the head of  the Senate, and upon him devolved the duty of imparting to Bonaparte the  wishes of the French people. Cambaceres--who, as a member of the  Convention, had voted for the condemnation of Louis XVI., in order that  royalty should be forever banished from French soil--this same  Cambaceres, was now the first to salute Bonaparte with \"imperial  majesty,\" and with the little word, so full of significance, \"sire.\" He  rewarded Cambaceres, for this by writing to him on the game day, and  appointing him high constable of the empire, as the first act of his  imperial rule. In this letter, the first document in which Bonaparte  signed himself merely Napoleon, the emperor retained the republican  style of writing. He addressed Cambaceres, as \"citizen consul,\" and  followed the revolutionary method of reckoning time, his letter being  dated \"the 20th Floreal, of the year 12.\"    The second act of the emperor, on the first day of his new dignity, was  to invest the members of his family also with new dignities, and to  confer upon them the rank of Princes of France, with the title \"imperial  highness.\" Moreover, he made his brother Joseph prince elector, and his  brother Louis connetable. On the same day it devolved upon Louis, in his  new dignity, to present the generals and staff officers to the emperor,  and then to conduct them to the empress--the Empress Josephine.    The prophecy of the negress of Martinique was now fulfilled. Josephine  was \"more than a queen.\" But Josephine, in the midst of the splendor of  her new dignity, could only think, with an anxious heart, of the  prophecy of the clairvoyante of Paris, who had told her, \"You will wear  a crown, but only for a short time.\" She felt that this wondrous fortune  could not last long--that the new emperor would have to do as the kings  or old had done, and sacrifice his dearest possession to Fate, in order  to appease the hungry demons of vengeance and envy; and that he would,  therefore, sacrifice her, in order to secure the perpetuity of his  fortune and dynasty.    It was this that weighed down the heart of the new empress, and made her  shrink in alarm from her new grandeur. It was, therefore, with a feeling  of deep anxiety that she took possession of the new titles and honors  that Fate had showered upon her, as from an inexhaustible horn of  plenty. With a degree of alarm, and almost with shame, she heard herself  addressed with the titles with which she had addressed the Queen of  France years before, in these same halls, when she came to the Tuileries  as Marquise de Beauharnais, to do homage to the beautiful Marie  Antoinette. She had died on the scaffold and now Josephine was the  \"majesty\" that sat enthroned in the Tuileries, her brilliant court  assembled around her, while in a retired nook of England the legitimate  King of France was leading a lonely and gloomy life.    Josephine, as we have said, was a good royalist; and, as empress, she  still mourned over the fate of the unfortunate Bourbons, and esteemed it  her sacred duty to assist and advise those who, true to their principles  and duties, had followed the royal family, or had emigrated, in order  that they might, at least, not be compelled to do homage to the new  system. Her purse was always at the service of the emigrants; and, if  Josephine continually made debts, in spite of her enormous monthly  allowance, her extravagance was not alone"]]]
