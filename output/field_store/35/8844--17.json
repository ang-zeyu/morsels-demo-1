You are an Englishman?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Already six Englishman have sought me, and each of the six died a  terrible death. What says the book?--                      \"A terrible death on this green earth,                     With never the slightest chance of heaven;                     Let him curse the day--the hour of his birth,                     The English victim numbered seven.\"    \"And you are _Number Seven,_ Mr. Mole. May all the powers of  heaven and earth preserve me from such a terrible doom as yours.\"    Mr. Mole almost fainted when the magician uttered such fearful words  respecting his (Mole's) fate.    Harry Girdwood, however, handed him a rum flask, and a good pull at  that restored his nerves.    \"Pooh!\" said he, \"I don't believe a word he uttered.\"    \"Still sceptical?\" said the magician. \"But to convince you of my power,  I will show you any thing you like in my magic mirror.\"    \"Very well, then, I should like to see Harkaway and Harvey at this  present moment--just to ascertain what they are doing--that will be a  test.\"    He chuckled as he said this.    But as he spoke the magic mirror grew light, and two figures were seen,  set, as it were, in a frame.    Jack Harkaway the elder, was seated in an arm-chair reading; beside him  stood his constant companion, Dick Harvey.    The latter's figure was the more remarkable of the two, and the  attitude was not merely characteristic, but it was startlingly like  life.    One hand was in his pocket; the other was at his face, the thumb  pointing at his nose, the fingers outstretched towards the audience.    \"What do you think of that?\" asked Harry Girdwood, in low tones.    \"Marvellous!\" cried Mole; \"that is Harkaway and Harvey, sure enough.  Harvey has got something the matter with his nose.\"    \"No,\" whispered Harry, \"he's taking a sight at you.\"    \"So he is. Just like Harvey. Harvey!\" he called out.    The mirror darkened, and the figures faded away from the sight upon the  instant.    \"Do you desire still another proof of my skill?\" asked the wizard.    \"Well you can, if you like, tell me something more about myself; but  don't put yourself to any trouble.\"    The wizard leant over his book earnestly for a consider able time.    \"I see here,\" said he, \"that you have contrived to keep one important  matter secret from your friends.\"    \"What?\"    \"The hairs of your head are numbered,\" continued the wizard.    Mr. Mole changed colour.    \"How--what?\"    \"By the barber; you wear a wig.\"    \"Oh, no--no!\" exclaimed Harry Girdwood, positively, \"You are wrong  there, sir, I assure you. Is he not, Mr. Mole?\"    \"Of course he is.\"    \"Will you see for yourself, unbelieving boy?\"    \"Yes,\" said Harry.    \"Where--say, where shall my familiar take it?\"    \"Up to the ceiling.\"    Mr. Mole groaned.    At the self-same instant out went the lights; a heavy hand was placed  upon Mr. Mole's head, and hey, presto! his wig was seen dancing about  at the ceiling, glittering with a phosphorescent light upon it.    Mr. Mole looked up, gave one awful yell, then made for the door, and  flew away as fast as his wooden legs would carry him.    And his yells continued, for all along his route young Jack had  sprinkled a plentiful supply of crackers, which exploded as he ran.    An unearthly chorus, sounding like the discordant laughter of invisible  fiends greeted his retreat, and he never stopped until he had got home,  panting and gasping for breath.    As soon as he was out of the room Harry Girdwood locked the door.    \"Come forth, my merry devils!\" he shouted. \"Old Mole's gone.\"    The curtain was drawn back, and in came Dick Harvey and Jack Harkaway,  carrying lights.    The wizard threw back his head dress and long horsehair wig, and showed  the grinning face of young Jack himself.    \"Bravo, Jack,\" said his comrade, Harry; \"you did it ever so much better  than the other conjuror did.\"    \"Was he frightened?\" inquired young Jack.    \"Poor old Mole! I never saw him so alarmed before.\"    Harvey and old Jack enjoyed the fun every bit as much as the boys.    \"My opinion is,\" said the elder Harkaway, laughing, \"that the triumph  of the whole job was in the dancing wig.\"    \"It was beautifully done,\" said Harvey.    \"I nearly missed it,\" said Harry Girdwood laughing, \"for you put out  the lights so suddenly that I couldn't find the string, and then I  nearly dug the hook into his head as well as his wig; and as for the  phosphorus, I gave him a dab with it upon the nose.\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\"    Every thing had been carefully arranged beforehand, it need hardly be  said, and a cord, with a fish-hook at the end of it, was run over a  small wheel fixed in the ceiling.    Harry held the other end of the cord, and as soon as the darkness and  confusion came, he drove the hook into poor old Mole's wig, while he  rubbed it dexterously with phosphorus, and then with a jerk he hauled  it up to the ceiling, where he set it dancing about, to the  indescribable horror of Mole.          CHAPTER XII.    WHEREIN MR. MOLE IS CRUELLY USED--THE GARDEN FETE--SUNDAY AND  MONDAY GIVE AN ENTERTAINMENT--ANOTHER LOOK INTO THE MAGIC  MIRROR--STUDIES OF NATURAL HISTORY--AN INVOLUNTARY PERFORMER.      When Isaac Mole had time to reflect coolly upon what had occurred,  doubts arose in his mind.    In spite of the seemingly inexplicable nature of the phenomena which he  had witnessed, he felt that Harkaway, father or son, must know  something of it.    Dick Harvey, he was morally sure, was in it.    If any thing fell, Harkaway would start up, on which Harvey or young  Jack would immediately inquire anxiously if he were startled, solely  for the purpose of leading up to Mole's words at the wizard's house.    \"Startled--nervous! Never; iron nerves, sir--adamant!\"    Upon these occasions, Mr. Mole would glide away from Harkaway's room  without a word, leaving his tormentors to have their grin out all to  themselves.    All they could do they could not make him drop a word of allusion to  the events just narrated.    On that topic he was utterly dumb. Day and night the worthy Isaac Mole  brooded over one solitary topic.    Revenge.    \"I'll teach 'em,\" he said; \"I'll let them know what it is to play  practical jokes with a man like me.\"    The last straw breaks the camel's back. The last indignity on his wig  proved too much for Isaac Mole, for he had until that fatal day at the  magician's, been fondly hugging himself in the delusion that the secret  was all his own.    The talk was tortured and twisted about so as to make it bear upon the  sorest subject for the poor old gentleman.    \"Dash my wig, Mr. Mole!\" Harvey would say; \"let's take a short country  excursion. You know the advantages of change of _hair.\"_    If a suggestion were wanting for the dinner of the day, a voice was  ready to advocate \"jugged hare.\"    \"That's very well,\" said Harkaway, \"but where can you get one in these  parts?\"    \"That's it,\" chimed in Harvey; \"as Mrs. Glasse says, first catch your  _hair,_ eh, Mr. Mole?\"    Mole winced.    \"It's not always easy to catch it, is it, Mr. Mole?\" said Harry  Girdwood, slyly.    \"Not if it flies too high,\" said young Jack.    This chaff goaded poor old Mole to fury, coming as it did from the  boys.    \"Really,\" he said, with a lofty sneer, \"I don't see what you have to  laugh at in the idle nonsense of these children.\"    This made them grin more than ever.    \"The wit of the rising generation,\" sneered Mole.    \"Mr. Mole would like the young generation never to rise, I think,\" said  Harry Girdwood.    \"That's it,\" laughed Harkaway; \"Mr. Mole was always so conservative in  his ideas.\"    \"Let me see, dad,\" said young Jack, looking puzzled; \"Conservative,  why, that means a Tory.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But, Mr. Mole, I thought that you always were a Whig.\"    Such a storm of laughter greeted this sally, that Mr. Mole could not  stand up against it.    Looking daggers at every body, he trudged out of the room, digging his  walking stick fiercely as he went.    Now at the door, who should he meet but Sunday, grinning from ear to  ear?    \"I'm not going to be fooled by you, you infernal black pudding,\" cried  Mole, exasperated beyond measure.    \"Yah, yah,\" grinned the mirthful Caesar Augustus, holding his sides.    \"Take that,\" cried Mole.    Sunday did take it.    It was not a pleasant dose, for \"that,\" in this instance, meant a  severe crack across the head with old Mole's walking stick.    Sunday rubbed his poll.    Happily the thick wool with which it was garnished saved the skull from  much danger, and a nigger's head is proverbially tough.    But yet Sunday did not relish the indignity.    \"You dam wooden-legged ole tief,\" he shouted out; \"I'll gib it to yar  for dis hyar.\"    And so, full of revengeful thoughts, the darkey sought his friend  Monday.    And they set to work plotting, with what result the next day  showed--much to the old gentleman's disgust.           *       *       *       *       *    They mustered a good round dinner-party upon the following day.    In front of the summer house was an object which excited Mr. Mole's  curiosity considerably.    One of the ladies asked what it was there for.    \"I don't know exactly what it is,\" replied Harkaway; \"something of  Monday's, I think, Dick.\"    \"I believe so,\" replied Harvey, carelessly.    \"They are going to give us an entertainment of some kind,\" said young  Jack.    The cloth having been cleared, Monday came forward, and bowing gravely,  addressed the company.    \"Ladies and gentlemen--\"    \"Hear, hear!\" from Mole, who, thinking himself free from attack,  determined to try a bit of chaff upon his own account.    \"Thank you, sar,\" said Monday, bowing gracefully to Mole.    \"Ladies and gentlemen--\"    \"Bravo, bravo!\" shouted Mole; \"exceedingly bravo.\"    \"Folks generally--sane and insane\"--here he bowed in a very marked  manner at Mr. Mole.    \"Hear, hear!\" cried Dick.    \"My entertainment is just a-gwi"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7346"],[0,"Among Malay Pirates : a Tale of Adventure and Peril (#15)"],[1,"soon as possible. We shall have to get out the  anchors and heave on them. We put on a full head of steam and drove her  two or three hundred yards through the mud before she finally brought  up. I wanted to get as near to you as possible, in order to clear the  woods round you.\"    By two o'clock the whole ship's company were on board again, and set  to work to get her off; but it was not until after some hours' exertion  that the Serpent was again afloat. She was at once turned round, steamed  down to the mouth of the creek, and cast anchor opposite the village.        CHAPTER IX.      The party landed at the village the next morning, but found it entirely  deserted.    \"It is most important that we should take a prisoner, Ferguson,\" the  captain said, as he and the first lieutenant paced up and down the  quarterdeck; \"we must catch the two prahus if we can. At present we  don't know whether they have gone up or down the river, and it would  be absolutely useless for us to wait until we get some clew to their  whereabouts. After we have finished with them, we will go up the other  branch, and try to find the two we know to be up there. I should not  like to leave our work unfinished.\"    \"Certainly not, sir. I am afraid, though, it is of no use landing to try  to get hold of a prisoner. No doubt the woods are full of them. There  are the townspeople and those who came to help them; and though many of  those who tried to swim ashore from the sunken boats may have been  taken by the alligators, still the greater portion must have landed all  right.\"    \"I should think, Mr. Ferguson, that it would be a good plan to send a  party of twenty men on shore after nightfall and to distribute them, two  men to a hut. Possibly two or three of the Malays may come down to the  village before morning, either to fetch valuables they may have left  behind, or to see whether we are still here. They may come tonight,  or they may come some time tomorrow, crawling through the plantations  behind the houses. At any rate, I will wait here a day or two on the  chance.\"    \"Whom shall I send with the men, sir?\"    \"You had better send Parkhurst and Balderson; they will have more  authority among the men than the younger midshipmen. The men better take  three days' cooked provisions on shore and ten small kegs of water, one  for each hut. I will give Parkhurst his instructions before he lands.\"    \"Now, Mr. Parkhurst,\" he said, when the boat was lowered soon after  dark, \"you must bear in mind that the greatest vigilance will be  necessary. Choose ten huts close together. One man in each hut must be  always awake; there must be no talking above a whisper; and during  the daytime no one must leave his hut on any account whatever. After  nightfall you and Mr. Balderson will move from hut to hut, to see that a  vigilant watch is kept. You must, of course, take watch and watch, night  and day. You must remember that not only is it most important that a  native should be captured, but you must be on your guard against an  attack on yourselves. It is quite conceivable that a party may come down  to see if there are any of us in the village.    \"In case of attack, you must gather in one hut, and fire three shots as  a signal to us; a musket shot will be fired in return. When you hear it,  every man must throw himself down, for the guns will be already loaded  with grape, and I shall fire a broadside towards the spot where I have  heard your signal.    \"As soon as the broadside is fired, make down to the shore, occupy a  house close to the water, and keep the Malays off till the boats come  ashore to fetch you off. Your crew has been very carefully picked. I  have consulted the warrant officers, and they have selected the most  taciturn men in the ship. There is to be no smoking; of course the men  can chew as much as they like; but the smell of tobacco smoke would at  once deter any native from entering a hut. If a Malay should come in and  try to escape, he must be fired on as he runs away; but the men are to  aim at his legs.\"    The instructions were carried out. A small hole was bored in the back  of each of the huts, so that a constant watch could be kept up unseen  by the closest observer in the forest, a hundred yards behind. The night  passed off quietly, as did the next day. The men slept and watched by  turns. On the afternoon of the second day, a native was seen moving  cautiously from tree to tree along the edge of the forest. As soon as it  was dark, Dick, whose watch it was, crawled cautiously from hut to hut.    \"That fellow we saw today may come at any moment,\" he said. \"If one of  you see him coming, the other must place himself close to the door, and  if he enters, throw himself upon him and hold his arms tightly till the  others come up to help. Keep your rope handy to twist round him, and  remember these fellows are as slippery as eels.\"    Having made the round, he returned to the hut in the center of the  others that he and Harry occupied. Half an hour later, they heard a  sudden outcry from the hut next to them, and rushing in, found the two  men there struggling with a Malay. With their aid he was speedily bound;  then the men were called from the other huts, and the whole party ran  down to the water's edge, where Harry hailed the ship. A boat put off  at once, and they were taken on board. The prisoner was led to  the captain's cabin, and there examined through the medium of the  interpreter. He refused to answer any questions until, by the captain's  orders, he was taken on deck again and a noose placed round his neck,  and the interpreter told him that, unless he spoke, he was to be hauled  up to the yard's arm. The man was still silent.    \"Tighten the strain very gradually,\" the captain said to the sailors  holding the other end of the rope. \"Raise him two or three feet above  the deck, and then, when the doctor holds up his hand, lower him at once  again.\"    This was done. The man, though half strangled, was still conscious, and  on the noose being loosened, and Soh Hay saying that, unless he spoke,  he would be again run up, he said, as soon as he got his breath, that he  would answer any question. On being taken to the cabin, he said that the  prahus had gone down the river, and had ascended the other arm. They had  only gone a few miles above the town, for one had been so injured that  there had been difficulty in keeping her afloat, and it was necessary to  run her into a creek in order to repair her before going up farther.    Half an hour later steam was up, and before morning the Serpent lay off  the mouth of the creek which the Malay pointed out as the one that the  prahu had entered. The second officer was this time placed in command  of the boats, he himself going in the launch, the third officer took the  first cutter, the two midshipmen the second. No time was lost in making  preparations, for it was desirable to capture the prahu before she was  aware that the Serpent had left her position in the other river. For  a mile the boats rowed up the creek, which narrowed until they were  obliged to go in single file. It widened suddenly, and as the launch  dashed through, a shower of balls tore up the water round her; while at  the same moment a great tree fell across the creek, completely barring  their retreat, and narrowly shaving the stern of the midshipmen's boat,  which was the last in the line. Fortunately the launch had escaped  serious injury, and with a shout of \"Treachery,\" Lieutenant Hopkins drew  his pistol to put a ball through the head of their guide, but as he did  so, the man sprang overboard and dived towards the shore.    \"Row, men; we have all our work cut out for us. There are three prahus  ahead; steer for the center one, coxswain.\"    With a cheer the men bent to their oars, and dashed at the prahu which,  as was evident by patches of plank freshly fastened to her side, was one  of those that had before escaped them.    \"Follow me,\" the lieutenant shouted to the boat behind; \"we must take  them one by one.\" The three boats dashed at the pirate craft, which was  crowded with men, regardless of the fire from the other two vessels.  The launch steered for her stem, the first cutter for her bow, while  the midshipmen swept round her, and boarded her on the opposite side. A  furious contest took place on her deck, the Malays being so confused  by being assailed at three points simultaneously that the midshipmen's  party were enabled to gain a footing with but very slight resistance.  The shouts of the Malays near them brought many running from the other  points, and the parties there gained a footing with comparatively little  loss. Then a desperate struggle began; but the Malays were unable to  withstand the furious attack of the British, and ere long began to leap  overboard and swim to the other craft, which were both coming to their  aid.    The launch's gun had not been fired, and, calling to Dick, Harry leaped  down into the boat. The two midshipmen trained the gun upon the nearest  prahu, and aiming at the waterline, fired it when the craft was within  twenty feet of them. A moment later its impetus brought it against the  side of the launch, which was crushed like an eggshell between it and  the captured prahu, the two midshipmen springing on board just in time.  It was the Malays' turn to board now, that of the British to prevent  them; the musketry of the sailors and marines for a time kept the enemy  off, but they strove desperately to gain a footing on board, until a  loud cry was heard, and the craft into which the midshipmen had fired  sank suddenly, and a loud cheer broke from the British.    The two midshipmen were engaged with the other pirate, from whom a cry  of dismay arose at seeing the disappearance of their friends.    \"Now, lads, follow me,\" Harry shouted as the Malays strove to push their  craft away. Followed by a dozen sailors, they leaped on to her"]]]
