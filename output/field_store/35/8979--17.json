Good to me? No ma'm--no  good there. And if you didn't work he'd see what was the matter. Lived  near Coffeyville in Upshaw county. That's whar my husband found me. I  was living with my aunt and uncle. They said the reason I had such a  good gift makin' quilts was cause my mother was a seamstress.    \"I cooked 'fore I married and I could make my own dresses, piece quilts  and quilt. That's mostly what I done. No laundry work. I never did farm  till I was married. After we went to Chicago in 1922, I took care of  other folks chillun, colored folks, while they was working in laundries  and factories. I sure has worked. I ain't nobody to what I was when I  was first married. I knowed how to turn, but I don't know whar to turn  now--I ain't able.    \"I use to could plow just as good as any man. I could put that dirt up  against that cotton and corn. I'd mold it up. Lay it by? Yes ma'm I'd  lay it by, too.    \"They didn't send me to school but they learned me how to work.    \"I had a quilt book with a lot o' different patterns but I loaned it to  a woman and she carried it to Oklahoma.

He said they use to go fishing and that Gracie always took her  quilt pieces along and if the fish were not biting she would sew. She  showed me twenty-two finished quilt tops, each of a different design and  several of the same design, or about thirty quilts in all. Two were  entirely of silk, two of applique design which called \"laid work\". They  were folded up in a trunk and as she took them out and spread them on  the bed for me to see she told me the name of the design. The following  are the names of the designs:      1. Breakfast Dish    2. Sawtooth (silk)    3. Tulip design (Laid work)    4. \"Prickle\" Pear    5. Little Boy's Breeches    6. Birds All Over the Elements    7. Drunkard's Path    8.

Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Hettie Mitchell (mulatto)                      Brinkley, Arkansas  Age: 69      \"I am sixty-nine years old. I was raised in Dyersburg, Tennessee. I can  tell you a few things mother told us. My own grandma on mother's side  was in South Carolina. She was stole when a child and brought to  Tennessee in a covered wagon. Her mother died from the grief of it. She  was hired out to nurse for these people. The people that stole her was  named Spence. She was a house woman for them till freedom. She was never  sold. Spences was not cruel people. Mother was never sold. She was the  mother of twelve and raised nine to a good age--more than grown. The  Spences seemed to always care for her children. When I go to Dyersburg  they always want us to come to see them and they treat us mighty well.    \"Mother was light. She said she had Indian strain (blood) but father was  very light and it was white blood but he never discussed it before his  children. So I can't tell you excepting he said he was owned by the  Brittians in South Carolina. He said his mother died soon after he was  sold. He was sold to a nigger trader and come in the gang to Memphis,  Tennessee and was put on the block and auctioned off to the highest  bidder. He was a farm hand.    \"Mother married father when she was nineteen years old. She was a house  girl. She lived close to her old mistress. She was very, very old before  she died she nearly stayed at my mother's house. Her mind wasn't right  and mother understood how to take care of her and was kind to her. The  Spences heard about grandma. They wrote and visited years after when  mother was a girl.    \"The way that father found out about his kin folks was this: One day a  creek was named and he told the white man, 'I was born close to that  creek and played there in the white sand and water when I was a little  boy.' The white man asked his name, said he knew the creek well too.  Father told him he never was named till he was sold and they named him  Sam--Sam Barnett. He was sold to Barnett in Memphis. But his dear own  mother called him 'Candy.' The white man found out about his people for  him and they found out his own dear mother died that same year he was  taken from South Carolina from grief. He heard from some of his people  from that time on till he died.    \"I worked on the farm in Tennessee till I married. I ironed, washed, and  have kept my own house and done the work that goes along with raising a  small family. We own our home. We have saved all we could along. I have  never had a real hard time like some I know. I guess my time is at hand  now. I don't know which way to turn since my husband got down sick.    \"I don't vote. Seem like it used to not be a nice place for women to go  where voting was taking place. Now they go mix up and vote. That is one  big change. Time is changing and changing the people. Maybe it is the  people is changing up the world as time goes by. We colored folks look  to the white folks to know the way to do. We have always done it.\"          Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Mary Mitchell, Hazen, Arkansas  Age: 60      \"I was born in Trenton, Tennessee. My parents had five children. They  were named William and Charlotte Wells. My father ran away and left my  mother with all the children to raise. By birth mother was a  Mississippian. She had been a nurse and my father was a timber man and  farmer. My mother said she had her hardest time raising her little  children. She was taken from her parents when a small girl and put on a  block and sold. She never said if her owners was bad to her, but she  said they was rough on Uncle Peter. He would fight. She said they would  tie Uncle Peter and whoop him with a strap. From what she said there was  a gang of slaves on Mr. Wade's place. He owned her. I never heard her  mention freedom but she said they had a big farm bell on a tall post in  the back yard and they had a horn to blow. It was a whistle made of a  cow's horn.    \"She said they was all afraid of the Ku Klux. They would ride across the  field and they could see that they was around, but they never come up  close to them.\"          Circumstances of Interview  STATE--Arkansas  NAME OF WORKER--Bernice Bowden  ADDRESS--1006 Oak Street, Pine Bluff, Arkansas  DATE--November 3, 1938  SUBJECT--Exslaves  [TR: Repetitive information deleted from subsequent pages.]      1.

Text of Interview    \"I was born down here on White River near Arkansas Post, August, 1849. I  belonged to Thomas Mitchel and when they (Yankees) took Arkansas Post,  our owners gathered us up and my young master took us to Texas and he  sold me to an Irishman named John McInish in Marshall for $1500. $500 in  gold and the rest in Confederate money. They called it the new issue.    \"I was twelve years old then and I stayed in Texas till I was  forty-eight. I was at Tyler, Texas when they freed us. When they took us  to Texas they left my mother and baby sister here in Arkansas, down here  on Oak Log Bayou. I never saw her again and when I came back here to  Arkansas, they said she had been dead twenty-eight years. Never did hear  of my father again.    \"I'm supposed to be part Creek Indian. Don't know how much. We have one  son, a farmer, lives across the river.

When they got near it, so that  the people could hear them, they began to cry and mourn.    \"Why is this?\" they were asked. \"Why are you mourning? Where is your  husband?\"    \"He is dead,\" they replied. \"Five days ago he went out to hunt, and he  never came back.\" And they cried and mourned again.    When the man fell into the pit, he was hurt. After a while he tried to get  out, but he was so badly bruised he could not climb up. A wolf, travelling  along, came to the pit and saw him, and pitied him. _Ah-h-w-o-o-o-o!  Ah-h-w-o-o-o-o!_ he howled, and when the other wolves heard him they all  came running to see what was the matter. There came also many coyotes,  badgers, and kit-foxes.    \"In this hole,\" said the wolf, \"is my find. Here is a fallen-in man. Let us  dig him out, and we will have him for our brother.\"    They all thought the wolf spoke well, and began to dig. In a little while  they had a hole close to the man. Then the wolf who found him said, \"Hold  on; I want to speak a few words to you.\" All the animals listening, he  continued, \"We will all have this man for our brother, but I found him, so  I think he ought to live with us big wolves.\" All the others said that this  was well; so the wolf went into the hole, and tearing down the rest of the  dirt, dragged the almost dead man out. They gave him a kidney to eat, and  when he was able to walk a little, the big wolves took him to their  home. Here there was a very old blind wolf, who had powerful medicine. He  cured the man, and made his head and hands look like those of a wolf. The  rest of his body was not changed.    In those days the people used to make holes in the pis'kun walls and set  snares, and when wolves and other animals came to steal meat, they were  caught by the neck. One night the wolves all went down to the pis'kun to  steal meat, and when they got close to it, the man-wolf said: \"Stand here a  little while. I will go down and fix the places, so you will not be  caught.\" He went on and sprung all the snares; then he went back and called  the wolves and others,--the coyotes, badgers, and foxes,--and they all went  in the pis'kun and feasted, and took meat to carry home.    In the morning the people were surprised to find the meat gone, and their  nooses all drawn out. They wondered how it could have been done. For many  nights the nooses were drawn and the meat stolen; but once, when the wolves  went there to steal, they found only the meat of a scabby bull, and the  man-wolf was angry, and cried out: \"Bad-you-give-us-o-o-o!  Bad-you-give-us-o-o-o-o!\"    The people heard him, and said: \"It is a man-wolf who has done all this. We  will catch him.\" So they put pemmican and nice back fat in the pis'kun, and  many hid close by. After dark the wolves came again, and when the man-wolf  saw the good food, he ran to it and began eating. Then the people all  rushed in and caught him with ropes and took him to a lodge. When they got  inside to the light of the fire, they knew at once who it was. They said,  \"This is the man who was lost.\"    \"No,\" said the man, \"I was not lost. My wives tried to kill me. They dug a  deep hole, and I fell into it, and I was hurt so badly that I could not get  out; but the wolves took pity on me and helped me, or I would have died  there.\"    When the people heard this, they were angry, and they told the man to do  something.    \"You say well,\" he replied. \"I give those women to the _I-kun-uh'-kah-tsi;_  they know what to do.\"    After that night the two women were never seen again.        THE FAST RUNNERS      Once, long ago, the antelope and the deer met on the prairie. At this time  both of them had galls and both dew claws. They began to talk together, and  each was telling the other what he could do. Each one told how fast he  could run, and before long they were disputing as to which could run the  faster. Neither would allow that the other could beat him, so they agreed  that they would have a race to decide which was the swifter, and they bet  their galls on the race. When they ran, the antelope proved the faster  runner, and beat the deer and took his gall.    Then the deer said: \"Yes, you have beaten me on the prairie, but that is  not where I live. I only go out there sometimes to feed, or when I am  travelling around. We ought to have another race in the timber. That is my  home, and there I can run faster than you can.\"    The antelope felt very big because he had beaten the deer in the race, and  he thought wherever they might be, he could run faster than the deer. So he  agreed to race in the timber, and on this race they bet their dew claws.    They ran through the thick timber, among the brush and over fallen logs,  and this time the antelope ran slowly, because he was not used to this kind  of travelling, and the deer easily beat him, and took his dew claws.    Since then the deer has had no gall, and the antelope no dew claws.    [NOTE. A version of the first portion of this story is current among the  Pawnees, and has been printed in Pawnee Hero Stories and Folk Tales.]        TWO WAR TRAILS      I    Many years ago there lived in the Blood camp a boy named Screech Owl  (A'-tsi-tsi). He was rather a lonely boy, and did not care to go with other  boys. He liked better to be by himself. Often he would go off alone, and  stay out all night away from the camp. He used to pray to all kinds of  birds and animals that he saw, and ask them to take pity on him and help  him, saying that he wanted to be a warrior. He never used paint. He was a  fine looking young man, and he thought it was foolish to use paint to make  oneself good looking.    When Screech Owl was about fourteen years old, a large party of Blackfeet  were starting to war against the Crees and the Assinaboines. The young man  said to his father: \"Father, with this war party many of my cousins are  going. I think that now I am old enough to go to war, and I would like to  join them.\" His father said, \"My son, I am willing; you may go.\" So he  joined the party.    His father gave his son his own war horse, a black horse with a white spot  on its side--a very fast horse. He offered him arms, but the boy refused  them all, except a little trapping axe. He said, \"I think this hatchet will  be all that I shall need.\" Just as they were about to start, his father  gave the boy his own war headdress. This was not a war bonnet, but a plume  made of small feathers, the feathers of thunder birds, for the thunder bird  was his father's medicine. He said to the boy, \"Now, my son, when you go  into battle, put this plume in your head, and wear it as I have worn it.\"    The party started and travelled north-east, and at length they came to  where Fort Pitt now stands, on the Saskatchewan River. When they had got  down below Fort Pitt, they saw three riders, going out hunting. These men  had not seen the war party. The Blackfeet started around the men, so as to  head them off when they should run. When they saw the men, the Screech Owl  got off his horse, and took off all his clothes, and put on his father's  war plume, and began to ride around, singing his father's war song. The  older warriors were getting ready for the attack, and when they saw this  young boy acting in this way, they thought he was making fun of the older  men, and they said: \"Here, look at this boy! Has he no shame? He had better  stay behind.\" When they got on their horses, they told him to stay behind,  and they charged the Crees. But the boy, instead of staying behind, charged  with them, and took the lead, for he had the best horse of all. He, a boy,  was leading the war party, and still singing his war song.    The three Crees began to run, and the boy kept gaining on them. They did  not want to separate, they kept together; and as the boy was getting closer  and closer, the last one turned in his saddle and shot at the Screech Owl,  but missed him. As the Cree fired, the boy whipped up his horse, and rode  up beside the Cree and struck him with his little trapping axe, and knocked  him off his horse. He paid no attention to the man that he had struck, but  rode on to the next Cree. As he came up with him, the Cree raised his gun  and fired, but just as he did so, the Blackfoot dropped down on the other  side of his horse, and the ball passed over him. He straightened up on his  horse, rode up by the Cree, and as he passed, knocked him off his horse  with his axe. When he knocked the second Cree off his horse, the Blackfeet,  who were following, whooped in triumph and to encourage him, shouting,  \"_A-wah-heh'_\" (Take courage). The boy was still singing his father's war  song.    By this time, the main body of the Blackfeet were catching up with him. He  whipped his horse on both sides, and rode on after the third Cree, who was  also whipping his horse as hard as he could, and trying to get  away. Meantime, some of the Blackfeet had stopped to count _coup_ on and  scalp the two dead Crees, and to catch the two ponies. Screech Owl at last  got near to the third Cree, who kept aiming his gun at him. The boy did not  want to get too close, until the Cree had fired his gun, but he was gaining  a little, and all the time was throwing himself from side to side on his  horse, so as to make it harder for the Cree to hit him. When he had nearly  overtaken the enemy, the Cree turned, raised his gun and fired; but the boy  had thrown himself down behind his horse, and again the ball passed over  him. He raised himself up on his horse, and rushed on the Cree, and struck  him in the side of the body with his axe, and then again, and with the  second blow, he knocked him off his horse.    The boy rode on a little further, stopped, and jumped off his horse, while  the rest of the Blackfeet had come up and were killing the fallen man. He  stood off to one side and watched"]]]
