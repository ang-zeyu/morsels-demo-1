Towards evening she  came home with her apron filled with all manner of flowers; but her hair  was quite wet, and hung all matted about her shoulders. (My God, my God,  was everything to come together to destroy me, wretched man that I am!) I  asked, therefore, where she had been that her hair was so wet and matted:  whereupon she answered that she had gathered flowers round the Koelpin, and  from thence she had gone down to the sea-shore, where she had bathed in  the sea, seeing that it was very hot and no one could see her. Thus, said  she, jesting, she should appear before his Majesty to-morrow doubly a  clean maid. This displeased me at the time, and I looked grave, although I  said nought.    Next morning at six o'clock all the people were already at the Giant's  Stone, men, women, and children. _Summa_, everybody that was able to walk  was there. At eight o'clock my daughter was already dressed in all her  bravery, namely, a blue silken gown, with a yellow apron and kerchief, and  a yellow hair-net, with a garland of blue and yellow flowers round her  head. It was not long before my young lord arrived, finely dressed, as  became a nobleman. He wanted to inquire, as he said, by which road I  should go up to the Stone with my daughter, seeing that his father, Hans  von Nienkerken, _item_ Wittich Appelmann and the Lepels of Gnitze, were  also going, and that there was much people on all the high roads, as  though a fair was being held. But I straightway perceived that all he  wanted was to see my daughter, inasmuch as he presently occupied himself  about her, and began chattering with her in the Latin again. He made her  repeat to him the _carmen_ to his Majesty; whereupon he, in the person of  the king, answered her: \"_Dulcissima et venustissima puella, quae mihi in  coloribus caeli, ut angelus Domini appares utinam semper mecum esses,  nunquam mihi male caderet_\"; whereupon she grew red, as likewise did I,  but from vexation, as may be easily guessed. I therefore begged that his  lordship would but go forward toward the Stone, seeing that my daughter  had yet to help me on with my surplice; whereupon, however, he answered  that he would wait for us the while in the chamber, and that we might then  go together. _Summa_, I blessed myself from this young lord; but what  could I do? As he would not go, I was forced to wink at it all; and before  long we went up to the Stone, where I straight-way chose three sturdy  fellows from the crowd, and sent them up the steeple, that they might  begin to ring the bells as soon as they should see me get up upon the  Stone and wave my napkin. This they promised to do, and straightway  departed; whereupon I sat down on the Stone with my daughter, thinking  that the young lord would surely stand apart, as became his dignity;  albeit he did not, but sat down with us on the Stone. And we three sat  there all alone, and all the folk looked at us, but none drew near to see  my child's fine clothes, not even the young lasses, as is their wont to  do; but this I did not observe till afterwards, when I heard how matters  stood with us even then. Towards nine o'clock Hans von Nienkerken and  Wittich Appelmann galloped up, and old Nienkerken called to his son in an  angry voice: and seeing that the young lord heard him not, he rode up to  the Stone, and cried out so loud that all the folk might hear, \"Canst thou  not hearken, boy, when thy father calls thee?\" Whereupon Ruediger followed  him in much displeasure, and we saw from a distance how the old lord  seemed to threaten his son, and spat out before him; but knew not what  this might signify: we were to learn it soon enough, though, more's the  pity! Soon after the two Lepels of Gnitze came from the Damerow; and the  noblemen saluted one other on the green sward close beside us, but without  looking on us. And I heard the Lepels say that nought could yet be seen of  his Majesty, but that the coastguard fleet around Ruden was in motion, and  that several hundred ships were sailing this way. As soon as this news was  known, all the folk ran to the sea-shore (which is but a step from the  Stone); and the noblemen rode thither too, all save Wittich, who had  dismounted, and who, when he saw that I sent old Paasch his boy up into a  tall oak-tree to look out for the king, straightway busied himself about  my daughter again, who now sat all alone upon the Stone: \"Why had she not  taken his huntsman? and whether she would not change her mind on the  matter and have him now, or else come into service with him (the Sheriff)  himself? for that if she would not, he believed she might be sorry for it  one day.\" Whereupon she answered him (as she told me), that there was but  one thing she was sorry for, namely, that his lordship would take so much  useless pains upon her; whereupon she rose with all haste and came to  where I stood under the tree, looking after the lad who was climbing up  it. But our old Ilse said that he swore a great curse when my daughter  turned her back upon him, and went straightway into the alder-grove close  by the high road, where stood the old witch Lizzie Kolken.    Meanwhile I went with my daughter to the sea-shore, and found it quite  true that the whole fleet was sailing over from Ruden and Oie towards  Wollin, and several ships passed so close before us that we could see the  soldiers standing upon them and the flashing of their arms. _Item_, we  heard the horses neigh and the soldiery laugh. On one ship, too, they were  drumming, and on another cattle lowed and sheep bleated. Whilst we yet  gazed we saw smoke come out from one of the ships, followed by a great  noise, and presently we were aware of the ball bounding over the water,  which foamed and splashed on either side, and coming straight towards us.  Hereupon the crowd ran away on every side with loud cries, and we plainly  heard the soldiery in the ships laugh thereat. But the ball flew up and  struck into the midst of an oak hard by Paasch his boy, so that nearly two  cartloads of boughs fell to the earth with a great crash, and covered all  the road by which his Majesty was to come. Hereupon the boy would stop no  longer in the tree, however much I exhorted him thereto, but cried out to  us as he came down that a great troop of soldiers was marching out of the  forest by Damerow, and that likely enough the king was among them.  Hereupon the Sheriff ordered the road to be cleared forthwith, and this  was some time a-doing, seeing that the thick boughs were stuck fast in the  trees all around; the nobles, as soon as all was made ready, would have  ridden to meet his Majesty, but stayed still on the little green sward,  because we already heard the noise of horses, carriages, and voices close  to us in the forest.    It was not long before the cannons broke through the brushwood with the  three guides seated upon them. And seeing that one of them was known to me  (it was Stoffer Krauthahn of Peenemuende), I drew near and begged him that  he would tell me when the king should come. But he answered that he was  going forward with the cannon to Coserow, and that I was only to watch for  a tall dark man, with a hat and feather and a gold chain round his neck,  for that that was the king, and that he rode next after the great standard  whereon was a yellow lion.    Wherefore I narrowly watched the procession as it wound out of the forest.  And next after the artillery came the Finnish and Lapland bowmen, who went  clothed all in furs, although it was now the height of summer, whereat I  greatly wondered. After these there came much people, but I know not what  they were. Presently I espied over the hazel-tree which stood in my way so  that I could not see everything as soon as it came forth out of the  coppice, the great flag with the lion on it, and behind that the head of a  very dark man with a golden chain round his neck, whereupon straightway I  judged this must be the king. I therefore waved my napkin toward the  steeple, whereupon the bells forthwith rang out, and while the dark man  rode nearer to us, I pulled off my skull-cap, fell upon my knees, and led  the Ambrosian hymn of praise, and all the people plucked their hats from  their heads and knelt down on the ground all around, singing after me;  men, women, and children, save only the nobles, who stood still on the  green sward, and did not take off their hats and behave with attention  until they saw that his Majesty drew in his horse. (It was a coal-black  charger, and stopped with its two fore-feet right upon my field, which I  took as a sign of good fortune.) When we had finished, the Sheriff quickly  got off his horse, and would have approached the king with his three  guides, who followed after him; _item_, I had taken my child by the hand,  and would also have drawn near to the king. Howbeit, his Majesty motioned  away the Sheriff and beckoned us to approach, whereupon I wished his  Majesty joy in the Latin tongue, and extolled his magnanimous heart,  seeing that he had deigned to visit German ground for the protection and  aid of poor persecuted Christendom; and praised it as a sign from God that  such had happened on this the high festival of our poor church, and I  prayed his Majesty graciously to receive what my daughter desired to  present to him; whereupon his Majesty looked on her and smiled pleasantly.  Such gracious bearing made her bold again, albeit she trembled visibly  just before, and she reached him a blue and yellow wreath, whereon lay the  _carmen_, saying, \"_Accipe hanc vilem coronam et haec_\" whereupon she  began to recite the _carmen_. Meanwhile his Majesty grew more and more  gracious, looking now on her and now on the _carmen_, and nodded with  especial kindness"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8745"],[0,"Wulf the Saxon: A Story of the Norman Conquest (#15)"],[1,"go down together, the rope is strong enough?\" Beorn  asked.    \"It is strong enough, but we had better go separately, Beorn; we  are neither of us accustomed to climb ropes, and if the upper one  were to slip down too fast he might knock the other off the rope.  It makes no matter who goes first. I will if you like, only mind  if you hear a footstep approaching let yourself down at once whether  I am off the rope or not. Be sure and twist your legs tightly round  it, or it will run through your fingers.\"    Taking hold of the rope he at once swung himself over, and without  much difficulty reached the bottom in safety. He had scarcely done  so when Beorn came down beside him with a rush.    \"What made you come down like that, you narrowly missed coming on  my head?\"    \"I believe I have cut my fingers to the bone,\" Beorn groaned; \"I  feel as if I were holding a bar of hot iron. You had scarcely started  before I heard voices; they were evidently those of men going their  rounds, so I caught hold of the rope and swung myself off, but  before I got my legs fairly round the rope I began to slip, and  though I gripped it as hard as I could I could not stop myself, but  slid down like lightning.\"    \"Hush!\" Wulf whispered, \"they are coming along above.\" The voices  came nearer until they sounded directly overhead Wulf knew that it  was very unlikely they would notice the rope in the dark, but he  felt much relieved as he heard them pass on. He waited until they  could no longer be heard.    \"Now, Beorn, we can safely be off.\"    It was muddy at the bottom of the fosse, but not so deep as they  thought it would be, and they scrambled up the opposite side and  then struck across the country south. Presently they came upon a  road, which they followed, until after three hours' walking they  reached the Authie river, at a spot where the bank was broken down.    \"This must be a ford, we had best try to wade across. Anyhow there  cannot be very many yards to swim, and we can both manage that.\"    They found that the bottom was pebbly, and that even in the middle  the water was not much above their waists.    \"That is something done, at any rate,\" Beorn said. \"Now which way  shall we go? This road we are on seems to lead south and we cannot  do better than follow it, the stars give us light enough, now that  our eyes are accustomed to the darkness.\"    \"Yes, we can keep this road, which is no doubt that by which we  travelled before, as far as the village which I heard them call  Noyelle, then we shall have to strike off to the left, for that  place was not far from Abbeville, and shall have to follow the Somme  up some distance, unless we can find means of crossing it.\"    \"I should think we had better leave the road before we get to the  village, so as to be well away from it. If any peasant were going  to work early and caught sight of us he would be sure to mention  it to any horseman who might come along searching for us. I noticed  that there were several woods on our right as we rode along.\"    \"That would be the safest way, no doubt,\" Wulf agreed. \"Fortunately  we can do without food for to-morrow\"--for both had managed to get  some supper after they had finished in the hall,--\"and having made  up my mind to escape to-night I hid away a large piece of bread  under my smock. We can manage very well on that.\"    Accordingly after an hour's walking they left the road and bore to  the south-west. But little of the land was cultivated, and they  were fortunate in not coming upon any woodland until light began  to break in the sky. Then they made their way to the nearest wood,  went in for some distance and then threw themselves down, and in a  few minutes were fast asleep. Accustomed to judge time by the  position of the sun, they saw when they awoke that it was already  past noon, and after eating a few mouthfuls of bread they continued  their journey. For the most part their course lay among woods, and  they did not venture across an open piece of country until after a  careful examination to see that no one was in sight.    Shortly after starting they caught sight of a village in the distance,  which they afterwards learned was St. Riguier, but with these  exceptions saw no human habitation. Late in the afternoon they came  down on the bank of the Somme. This was thickly covered with long  reeds and rushes, and among these they sat down and ate the rest  of their bread, confident that however vigilant the search they  would not be traced.    \"This is a very different matter to the last crossing,\" Beorn said.  \"This is a wide river, and I fear that I could not swim across it.\"    \"Nor should I like to try. But fortunately there is no occasion for  us to trust to swimming; for we can pull up or break off a number  of these great rushes and make them into two bunches; these will  give us ample support for our passage.\"    \"So they will, Wulf; I should never have thought of that.\"    Two large bundles were soon made, the reeds being tied together by  a tough climber that wreathed itself everywhere among them, and as  soon as it was quite dark they went down to the water's edge, and  found to their satisfaction that the reeds possessed ample buoyancy  for their purpose. Wading in they started swimming, resting their  chests on the reeds and striking out with their legs, and in a few  minutes were on the southern bank of the river.    \"Now we must make to the east of south,\" Wulf said. \"I should say  if we walk steadily all night we shall be beyond the territory of  this vile count. I hope before long we shall strike on some road  leading in the right direction, for if we get among the woods again  we shall be able to make no progress. But any road we may come upon  going at all in the right direction is likely to lead to Rouen.\"    \"How far is it, do you think?\"    \"I have a very vague idea. The prior had a map of Normandy, and on  this he pointed out to me how the duchy had grown since William  came as a boy to be its duke. I can remember the general position  of the town, but not more than that. I should think from the Somme  to Rouen must be over seventy miles and less than a hundred, but  more closely than that I cannot guess.\"    They came upon no road before morning, but as the country was open  they made good progress, and when they lay down in a thicket as the  day was breaking they calculated that they must be nearly thirty  miles south of the Somme.    \"I feel that I want sleep,\" Beorn said, \"but still more that I want  food. If it is another sixty miles to Rouen I know not how we are  going to travel the distance fasting.\"    \"No, we must get some food to morrow or rather to day, Beorn. We  have nothing of any value to offer for it. They searched us too  closely for anything to escape them. We dare not go into any town  or village until we are quite sure that we are beyond the count's  territories, but we might enter some solitary hut and pray for a  piece of bread for charity, or we can walk all day, by which time  we shall surely be well beyond the Count of Ponthieu's territory,  and could boldly go into a town. If we are seized, we can demand  to be sent to Rouen, saying we are bearers of an important message  to Duke William, and even if they do not send us straight on, they  would hardly keep us without food.\"    After sleeping for four or five hours they again started, and after  walking some miles came upon a herdsman's cottage The man was out,  and his wife looked with surprise at the two lads, whose garments,  though stained by sea water and travel, were evidently those of  youths of a class above the common. Beorn addressed her in her own  language, and told her that they were wayfarers who had lost their  road and were grievously in need of food. She at once invited them  to come in, and set before them some black bread and some cheese  made from goats' milk. They learned to their satisfaction that they  had long passed the limits of Ponthieu, and that Rouen was distant  about fifty miles.    \"The road from Amiens lies five miles to the east,\" she said; \"but  it would be shorter for you to keep due south, for it inclines in  that direction. You will strike it after seven miles' walking, and  after that you cannot miss your way.\"    After warmly thanking the woman for her hospitality the lads again  started, feeling greatly strengthened and refreshed by their meal;  but want of sleep told upon them, and when they got within sight  of the road they again lay down, and slept until the sun was setting.  Resuming their journey they followed the road, and before morning  crossed over a range of hills, and presently arrived at a small  hamlet close to which was a monastery. Towards this they directed  their steps, and seating themselves on the ground near the door,  waited until it was unbarred.    \"You are early wayfarers, my sons,\" the monk who opened the gates  said as they went up, \"and you seem to have travelled far.\"    \"That have we, father, and are sorely in need of food.\"    The hospitality of the monasteries was unbounded, and the monk at  once led them into the kitchen, where bread, meat, and wine were  placed before them.    \"Truly you were hungry,\" the monk said smilingly as he watched their  onslaught upon the joint.    \"We were well-nigh starving, father. For two days we have had nought  to eat save a crust of bread we had brought with us, and some that  a shepherd's wife bestowed upon us out of charity, and we have  walked from near Hesdin.\"    \"I do not ask out of curiosity, my sons,\" the monk said after a  pause, \"and you know it is not our custom to question wayfarers who  come in to ask our hospitality; but it is strange to see two youths,  who by their dress and manner seem to belong to a superior station,  in so pitiable a state as you are, and wandering alone, as it would  seem, penniless through the country.
