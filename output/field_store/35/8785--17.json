ALLIDA.        Having known the writer of this book for a number of years, and knowing  the many privations and mortifications she has had to pass through, I  the more willingly add my testimony to the truth of her assertions. She  is one of that class, who by some are considered not only as little  lower than the angels, but far beneath them; but I have long since  learned that we are not to look at the color of the hair, the eyes, or  the skin, for the man or woman; their life is the criterion we are to  judge by. The writer of this book has seemed to be a child of  misfortune.    Early in life she was deprived of her parents, and all those endearing  associations to which childhood clings. Indeed, she may be said not to  have had that happy period; for, being taken from home so young, and  placed where she had nothing to love or cling to, I often wonder she had  not grown up a MONSTER; and those very people calling themselves  Christians, (the good Lord deliver me from such,) and they likewise  ruined her health by hard work, both in the field and house. She was  indeed a slave, in every sense of the word; and a lonely one, too.    But she has found some friends in this degraded world, that were willing  to do by others as they would have others do by them; that were willing  she should live, and have an existence on the earth with them. She has  never enjoyed any degree of comfortable health since she was eighteen  years of age, and a great deal of the time has been confined to her room  and bed. She is now trying to write a book; and I hope the public will  look favorably on it, and patronize the same, for she is a worthy woman.    Her own health being poor, and having a child to care for, (for, by the  way, she has been married,) and she wishes to educate him; in her  sickness he has been taken from her, and sent to the county farm,  because she could not pay his board every week; but as soon as she was  able, she took him from that PLACE, and now he has a home where he is  contented and happy, and where he is considered as good as those he is  with. He is an intelligent, smart boy, and no doubt will make a smart  man, if he is rightly managed. He is beloved by his playmates, and by  all the friends of the family; for the family do not recognize those as  friends who do not include him in their family, or as one of them, and  his mother as a daughter--for they treat her as such; and she certainly  deserves all the affection and kindness that is bestowed upon her, and  they are always happy to have her visit them whenever she will. They are  not wealthy, but the latch-string is always out when suffering humanity  needs a shelter; the last loaf they are willing to divide with those  more needy than themselves, remembering these words, Do good as we have  opportunity; and we can always find opportunity, if we have the  disposition.    And now I would say, I hope those who call themselves friends of our  dark-skinned brethren, will lend a helping hand, and assist our sister,  not in giving, but in buying a book; the expense is trifling, and the  reward of doing good is great. Our duty is to our fellow-beings, and  when we let an opportunity pass, we know not what we lose. Therefore we  should do with all our might what our hands find to do; and remember the  words of Him who went about doing good, that inasmuch as ye have done a  good deed to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to  me; and even a cup of water is not forgotten. Therefore, let us work  while the day lasts, and we shall in no wise lose our reward.    MARGARETTA THORN.    MILFORD, JULY 20th, 1859.        Feeling a deep interest in the welfare of the writer of this book, and  hoping that its circulation will be extensive, I wish to say a few words  in her behalf. I have been acquainted with her for several years, and  have always found her worthy the esteem of all friends of humanity; one  whose soul is alive to the work to which she puts her hand.. Although  her complexion is a little darker than my own, I esteem it a privilege  to associate with her, and assist her whenever an opportunity presents  itself. It is with this motive that I write these few lines, knowing  this book must be interesting to all who have any knowledge of the  writer's character, or wish to have. I hope no one will refuse to aid  her in her work, as she is worthy the sympathy of all Christians, and  those who have a spark of humanity in their breasts.    Thinking it unnecessary for me to write a long epistle, I will close by  bidding her God speed.    C. D.

But the difference in  the banks, though an unending alternation between two appearances,  is weird.    At high-water you do not see the mangroves displaying their ankles  in the way that shocked Captain Lugard.  They look most respectable,  their foliage rising densely in a wall irregularly striped here and  there by the white line of an aerial root, coming straight down into  the water from some upper branch as straight as a plummet, in the  strange, knowing way an aerial root of a mangrove does, keeping the  hard straight line until it gets some two feet above water-level,  and then spreading out into blunt fingers with which to dip into the  water and grasp the mud.  Banks indeed at high water can hardly be  said to exist, the water stretching away into the mangrove swamps  for miles and miles, and you can then go, in a suitable small canoe,  away among these swamps as far as you please.    This is a fascinating pursuit.  But it is a pleasure to be indulged  in with caution; for one thing, you are certain to come across  crocodiles.  Now a crocodile drifting down in deep water, or lying  asleep with its jaws open on a sand-bank in the sun, is a  picturesque adornment to the landscape when you are on the deck of a  steamer, and you can write home about it and frighten your relations  on your behalf; but when you are away among the swamps in a small  dug-out canoe, and that crocodile and his relations are awake--a  thing he makes a point of being at flood tide because of fish coming  along--and when he has got his foot upon his native heath--that is  to say, his tail within holding reach of his native mud--he is  highly interesting, and you may not be able to write home about him-  -and you get frightened on your own behalf; for crocodiles can, and  often do, in such places, grab at people in small canoes.  I have  known of several natives losing their lives in this way; some native  villages are approachable from the main river by a short cut, as it  were, through the mangrove swamps, and the inhabitants of such  villages will now and then go across this way with small canoes  instead of by the constant channel to the village, which is almost  always winding.  In addition to this unpleasantness you are liable--  until you realise the danger from experience, or have native advice  on the point--to get tide-trapped away in the swamps, the water  falling round you when you are away in some deep pool or lagoon, and  you find you cannot get back to the main river.  Of course if you  really want a truly safe investment in Fame, and really care about  Posterity, and Posterity's Science, you will jump over into the  black batter-like, stinking slime, cheered by the thought of the  terrific sensation you will produce 20,000 years hence, and the care  you will be taken of then by your fellow-creatures, in a museum.  But if you are a mere ordinary person of a retiring nature, like me,  you stop in your lagoon until the tide rises again; most of your  attention is directed to dealing with an \"at home\" to crocodiles and  mangrove flies, and with the fearful stench of the slime round you.  What little time you have over you will employ in wondering why you  came to West Africa, and why, after having reached this point of  folly, you need have gone and painted the lily and adorned the rose,  by being such a colossal ass as to come fooling about in mangrove  swamps.    Still, even if your own peculiar tastes and avocations do not take  you in small dug-out canoes into the heart of the swamps, you can  observe the difference in the local scenery made by the flowing of  the tide when you are on a vessel stuck on a sand-bank, in the Rio  del Rey for example.  Moreover, as you will have little else to  attend to, save mosquitoes and mangrove flies, when in such a  situation, you may as well pursue the study.  At the ebb gradually  the foliage of the lower branches of the mangroves grows wet and  muddy, until there is a great black band about three feet deep above  the surface of the water in all directions; gradually a network of  gray-white roots rises up, and below this again, gradually, a slope  of smooth and lead-grey slime.  The effect is not in the least as if  the water had fallen, but as if the mangroves had, with one accord,  risen up out of it, and into it again they seem silently to sink  when the flood comes.  But by this more safe, if still unpleasant,  method of observing mangrove-swamps, you miss seeing in full the  make of them, for away in their fastnesses the mangroves raise their  branches far above the reach of tide line, and the great gray roots  of the older trees are always sticking up in mid-air.  But, fringing  the rivers, there is always a hedge of younger mangroves whose lower  branches get immersed.    At corners here and there from the river face you can see the land  being made from the waters.  A mud-bank forms off it, a mangrove  seed lights on it, and the thing's done.  Well! not done, perhaps,  but begun; for if the bank is high enough to get exposed at low  water, this pioneer mangrove grows.  He has a wretched existence  though.  You have only got to look at his dwarfed attenuated form to  see this.  He gets joined by a few more bold spirits and they  struggle on together, their network of roots stopping abundance of  mud, and by good chance now and then a consignment of miscellaneous  debris of palm leaves, or a floating tree-trunk, but they always die  before they attain any considerable height.  Still even in death  they collect.  Their bare white stems remaining like a net gripped  in the mud, so that these pioneer mangrove heroes may be said to  have laid down their lives to make that mud-bank fit for  colonisation, for the time gradually comes when other mangroves can  and do colonise on it, and flourish, extending their territory  steadily; and the mud-bank joins up with, and becomes a part of,  Africa.    Right away on the inland fringe of the swamp--you may go some  hundreds of miles before you get there--you can see the rest of the  process.  The mangroves there have risen up, and dried the mud to an  extent that is more than good for themselves, have over civilised  that mud in fact, and so the brackish waters of the tide--which,  although their enemy when too deep or too strong in salt, is  essential to their existence--cannot get to their roots.  They have  done this gradually, as a mangrove does all things, but they have  done it, and down on to that mud come a whole set of palms from the  old mainland, who in their early colonisation days go through  similarly trying experiences.  First the screw-pines come and live  among them; then the wine-palm and various creepers, and then the  oil-palm; and the debris of these plants being greater and making  better soil than dead mangroves, they work quicker and the mangrove  is doomed.  Soon the salt waters are shut right out, the mangrove  dies, and that bit of Africa is made.  It is very interesting to get  into these regions; you see along the river-bank a rich, thick,  lovely wall of soft-wooded plants, and behind this you find great  stretches of death;--miles and miles sometimes of gaunt white  mangrove skeletons standing on gray stuff that is not yet earth and  is no longer slime, and through the crust of which you can sink into  rotting putrefaction.  Yet, long after you are dead, buried, and  forgotten, this will become a forest of soft-wooded plants and  palms; and finally of hard-wooded trees.  Districts of this  description you will find in great sweeps of Kama country for  example, and in the rich low regions up to the base of the Sierra  del Cristal and the Rumby range.    You often hear the utter lifelessness of mangrove-swamps commented  on; why I do not know, for they are fairly heavily stocked with  fauna, though the species are comparatively few.  There are the  crocodiles, more of them than any one wants; there are quantities of  flies, particularly the big silent mangrove-fly which lays an egg in  you under the skin; the egg becomes a maggot and stays there until  it feels fit to enter into external life.  Then there are \"slimy  things that crawl with legs upon a slimy sea,\" and any quantity of  hopping mud-fish, and crabs, and a certain mollusc, and in the water  various kinds of cat-fish.  Birdless they are save for the flocks of  gray parrots that pass over them at evening, hoarsely squarking; and  save for this squarking of the parrots the swamps are silent all the  day, at least during the dry season; in the wet season there is no  silence night or day in West Africa, but that roar of the descending  deluge of rain that is more monotonous and more gloomy than any  silence can be.  In the morning you do not hear the long, low,  mellow whistle of the plantain-eaters calling up the dawn, nor in  the evening the clock-bird nor the Handel-Festival-sized choruses of  frogs, or the crickets, that carry on their vesper controversy of  \"she did\"--\"she didn't\" so fiercely on hard land.    But the mangrove-swamp follows the general rule for West Africa, and  night in it is noisier than the day.  After dark it is full of  noises; grunts from I know not what, splashes from jumping fish, the  peculiar whirr of rushing crabs, and quaint creaking and groaning  sounds from the trees; and--above all in eeriness--the strange whine  and sighing cough of crocodiles.    Great regions of mangrove-swamps are a characteristic feature of the  West African Coast.  The first of these lies north of Sierra Leone;  then they occur, but of smaller dimensions--just fringes of river-  outfalls--until"]]]
