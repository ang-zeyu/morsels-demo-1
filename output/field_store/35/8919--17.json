[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],[0,"The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#15)"],[1," to be soiled, I want to do all the soiling myself. It  is very different with a manuscript, which cannot be too old or too dowdy.  These are its graces. Dr. Neubauer once said to me, \"I take no interest in  a girl who has seen more than seventeen years, nor in a manuscript that has  seen less than seven hundred.\" Alonzo of Aragon was wont to say in  commendation of age, that \"age appeared to be best in four things: old wood  to burn; old wine to drink; old friends to trust; and old authors to read.\"    This, however, is not my present point, for I have too much consideration  for my readers to attempt to embroil them in the old \"battle of the books\"  that raged round the silly question whether the ancients or the moderns  wrote better. I am discussing the age, not of the author, but of the copy.  As a critic, as an admirer of old printing, as an archeologist, I feel  regard for the _editio princeps_, but as a lover I prefer the cheap  reprint. Old manuscripts certainly have their charm, but they must have  been written at least before the invention of printing. Otherwise a  manuscript is an anachronism--it recalls too readily the editorial  \"declined with thanks.\" At best, the autograph original of a modern work is  a literary curiosity, it reveals the author's mechanism, not his mind. But  old manuscripts are in a different case; their age has increased their  charm, mellowed and confirmed their graces, whether they be canonical  books, which \"defile the hand\" in the Rabbinical sense, or Genizah-grimed  fragments, which soil the fingers more literally. And when the dust of ages  is removed, these old-world relics renew their youth, and stand forth as  witnesses to Israel's unshakable devotion to his heritage.    I have confessed to one Philistine habit; let me plead guilty to another. I  prefer to read a book rather than hear a lecture, because in the case of  the book I can turn to the last page first. I do like to know before I  start whether _he_ marries _her_ in the end or not. You cannot do this with  a spoken discourse, for you have to wait the lecturer's pleasure, and may  discover to your chagrin, not only that the end is very long in coming, but  that when it does come, it is of such a nature that, had you foreseen it,  you would certainly not have been present at the beginning. The real  interest of a love story is its process: though you may read the  consummation first, you are still anxious as to the course of the  courtship. But, in sober earnest, those people err who censure readers for  trying to peep at the last page first. For this much-abused habit has a  deep significance when applied to life. You will remember the ritual rule,  \"It is the custom of all Israel for the reader of the Scroll of Esther to  read and spread out the Scroll like a letter, to make the miracle visible.\"  I remember hearing a sermon just before Purim, in Vienna, and the Jewish  preacher gave an admirable homiletic explanation of this rule. He pointed  out that in the story of Esther the fate of the Jews has very dark moments,  destruction faces them, and hope is remote. But in the end? In the end all  goes well. Now, by spreading out the Megillah in folds, displaying the end  with the beginning, \"the miracle is made visible.\" Once Lord Salisbury,  when some timid Englishmen regarded the approach of the Russians to India  as a menace, told his countrymen to use large-scale maps, for these would  convince them that the Russians were not so near India after all. We Jews  suffer from the same nervousness. We need to use large-scale charts of  human history. We need to read history in centuries, not in years. Then we  should see things in their true perspective, with God changeless, as men  move down the ringing grooves of change. We should then be fuller of  content and confidence. We might gain a glimpse of the Divine plan, and  might perhaps get out of our habit of crying \"All is lost\" at every passing  persecution. As if never before had there been weeping for a night! As if  there had not always been abounding joy the morning after! Then let us,  like God Himself, try to see the end in the beginning, let us spread out  the Scroll, so that the glory of the finish may transfigure and illumine  the gloom and sadness of the intermediate course, and thus \"the miracle\" of  God's providential love will be \"made visible\" to all who have eyes to see  it.    What strikes a real lover of books when he casts his eye over the fine  things that have been said about reading, is this: there is too much said  about profit, about advantage. \"Reading,\" said Bacon, \"maketh a full man,\"  and reading has been justified a thousand times on this famous plea. But,  some one else, I forget who, says, \"You may as well expect to become strong  by always eating, as wise by always reading.\" Herbert Spencer was once  blamed by a friend for reading so little. Spencer replied, \"If I read as  much as you do, I should know as little as you do.\" Too many of the  eulogies of books are utilitarian. A book has been termed \"the home  traveller's ship or horse,\" and libraries, \"the wardrobes of literature.\"  Another favorite phrase is Montaigne's, \"'Tis the best viaticum for this  human journey,\" a phrase paralleled by the Rabbinic use of the Biblical  \"provender for the way.\" \"The aliment of youth, the comfort of old age,\" so  Cicero terms books. \"The sick man is not to be pitied when he has his cure  in his sleeve\"--that is where they used to carry their books. But I cannot  go through the long list of the beautiful, yet inadequate, similes that  abound in the works of great men, many of which can be read in the  \"Book-Lover's Enchiridion,\" to which I have already alluded.    One constant comparison is of books to friends. This is perhaps best worked  out in one of the Epistles of Erasmus, which the \"Enchiridion\" omits: \"You  want to know what I am doing. I devote myself to my friends, with whom I  enjoy the most delightful intercourse. With them I shut myself in some  corner, where I avoid the gaping crowd, and either speak to them in sweet  whispers, or listen to their gentle voices, talking with them as with  myself. Can anything be more convenient than this? They never hide their  own secrets, while they keep sacred whatever is entrusted to them. They  speak when bidden, and when not bidden they hold their tongue. They talk of  what you wish, and as long as you wish; do not flatter, feign nothing, keep  back nothing, freely tell you of your faults, and take no man's character  away. What they say is either amusing or wholesome. In prosperity they  moderate, in affliction they console; they do not vary with fortune, they  follow you in all dangers, and last out to the very grave. Nothing can be  more candid than their relations with one another. I visit them from time  to time, now choosing one companion and now another, with perfect  impartiality. With these humble friends, I bury myself in seclusion. What  wealth or what sceptres would I take in exchange for this tranquil life?\"    Tranquillity is a not unworthy characteristic of the scholar, but, taking  Erasmus at his word, would he not have been even a greater man than he was,  had he been less tranquil and more strenuous? His great role in the history  of European culture would have been greater still, had he been readier to  bear the rubs which come from rough contact with the world. I will not,  however, allow myself to be led off into this alluring digression, whether  books or experience make a man wiser. Books may simply turn a man into a  \"learned fool,\" and, on the other hand, experience may equally fail to  teach any of the lessons of wisdom. As Moore says:      My only books    Were woman's looks,    And folly's all they taught me.    The so-called men of the world often know little enough of the world of  men. It is a delusion to think that the business man is necessarily  business-like. Your business man is often the most un-business-like  creature imaginable. For practical ability, give me the man of letters.  Life among books often leads to insight into the book of life. At Cambridge  we speak of the reading men and the sporting men. Sir Richard Jebb, when he  went to Cambridge, was asked, \"Do you mean to be a sporting man or a  reading man?\" He replied, \"Neither! I want to be a man who reads.\" Marcus  Aurelius, the scholar and philosopher, was not the least efficient of the  Emperors of Rome. James Martineau was right when he said that the student  not only becomes a better man, but he also becomes a better student, when  he concerns himself with the practical affairs of life as well as with his  books. And the idea cuts both ways. We should be better men of business if  we were also men of books. It is not necessary to recall that the ancient  Rabbis were not professional bookmen. They were smiths and ploughmen,  traders and merchants, and their businesses and their trades were idealized  and ennobled--and, may we not add, their handiwork improved?--by the  expenditure of their leisure in the schools and libraries of Jerusalem.    And so all the foregoing comparisons between books and other objects of  utility or delight, charming though some of these comparisons are, fail to  satisfy one. One feels that the old Jewish conception is the only  completely true one: that conception which came to its climax in the  appointment of a benediction to be uttered before beginning to read a book  of the Law.    The real solace of books comes from the sense of service, to be rendered or  received; and one must enter that holy of holies, the library, with a  grateful benediction on one's lip, and humility and reverence and joy in  one's soul. Of all the writers about books, Charles Lamb, in his playful  way, comes nearest to this old-world, yet imperishable, ideal of the Jewish  sages. He says: \"I own that I am disposed to say grace upon twenty other  occasions in the course of the day"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],[0,"Introductory American History (#15)"],[1,"way of governing    themselves than either the Greeks or the Romans. We call it the    representative system. If a Roman citizen who lived far from Rome wanted    to take part in the elections, he was obliged to leave his farm or his    business and travel to Rome, for only the citizens who were at Rome    could have a share in making the laws. It never occurred to the Romans    that the citizens outside of Rome could send some of their number as    representatives to Rome. The formation of the English parliament was an    important step towards what we mean in America by \"government of the    people, for the people, and by the people.\"            QUESTIONS        1. Mention the names of heroes or hero-kings of the Middle Ages.      What stories have you learned about these heroes?        2. Who was the hero-king of the English? How did he early show his      love of books? What did he do to help his people to a knowledge      of books?        3. How did he succeed better than other kings in driving back the      Danes?

If the English    succeeded better than other Europeans in learning how to govern    themselves, one reason was that the Channel protected them from attack,    and they could quarrel with their king without running much risk that    their enemies in other countries would take advantage of the quarrel to    seize their lands or attempt to conquer them.      The French were not so well placed. France also was not united like    England, and whole districts called counties or duchies were almost    independent of the king, being ruled by their counts and dukes. In    France it would not have been wise for the people to quarrel with the    king, for he was their natural protector against cruel lords. Germany    and Italy were even more divided, with not only counties and duchies,    but also cities nearly as independent as the ancient cities of Greece.      The Europeans on the Continent did many things which the English were    doing, and some of these were so well done that the English were ready    to accept these Europeans as their teachers. The memory of what the    Greeks and the Romans had done remained longer in southern France and    Italy because so many buildings were still standing which reminded    Frenchmen and Italians of the people who built them.      [Illustration: A MONK COPYING MANUSCRIPT BOOKS]    CLASSES OF PEOPLE. The people of Europe, as well as of England,    were divided into two classes, nobles and peasants. The clergy seemed to    form another class because there were so many of them. Besides the    parish priests and the bishops there were thousands of monks, who were    persons who chose to dwell together in monasteries under the rule of an    abbot or a prior, rather than live among ordinary people where men were    so often tempted to do wrong or were so likely to be wronged by others.    The monks worked on the farms of the monasteries, or studied in the    libraries, or prayed and fasted. For a long time the men who knew how to    read were nearly always monks or priests. Outside of the monasteries or    the bishops' houses there were few books.    THE NOBLES. The nobles were either knights, barons, counts, or    dukes. In England there were also earls. Many mediaeval nobles ruled    like kings, but over a smaller territory. They gained their power    because they were rich in land and could support many men who were ready    to follow them in battle, or because in the constant wars they proved    themselves able to keep anything they took, whether it was a hilltop or    a town. Timid and peaceable people were often glad to put themselves    under the protection of such a fighter, who saved them from being robbed    by other fighting nobles.      In this way the nobles served a good purpose until the kings, who were    at first only very successful nobles, were able to bring nobles as well    as peasants under their own rule and to compel every one to obey the    same laws. After this the nobles became what we call an aristocracy,    proud of their family history, generally living in better houses and    owning more land than their neighbors, but with little power    over others.

Soldiers' Lodgings]      [Illustration: PIERREFONDS--ONE OF THE GREAT CASTLES OF FRANCE]    CASTLES. For safety, kings and nobles in the Middle Ages were    obliged to build strong stone forts or fortified houses called castles.    They were often placed on a hilltop or on an island or in a spot where    approach to the walls could be made difficult by a broad canal, or moat,    filled with water. At different places along the walls were towers, and    within the outer ring of walls a great tower, or keep, which was hard to    capture even after the rest of the castle had been entered by the enemy.    These castles were gloomy places to live in until, centuries later,    their inner walls were pierced with windows. Many are still standing,    others are interesting heaps of ruins.    KNIGHTHOOD. The lords of the castles were occupied mostly in    hunting or fighting. They fought to keep other lords from interfering    with them or to win for themselves more lands and power. They hunted    that they might have meat for their tables. In later times, when it was    not so necessary to kill animals for food, they hunted as a sport.    Fighting also ceased to be the chief occupation, although the nobles    were expected to accompany the king in his wars.      From boyhood the sons of nobles, unless they entered the Church as    priests or monks, were taught the art of fighting. A boy was sent to the    castle of another lord, where he served as a page, waiting on the lord    at table or running errands. He was trained to ride a horse boldly and    to be skilful with the sword and the lance. When his education was    finished he was usually made a knight, an event which took place with    many interesting ceremonies.      The young man bathed, as a sign that he was pure. The weapons and arms    for his use were blessed by a priest and laid on the altar of the    church, and near them he knelt and prayed all night. In the final    ceremony a sword was girded upon him and he received a slight blow on    the neck from the sword of some knight, or perhaps of the king. His    armor covered him from head to foot in metal, and sometimes his horse    was also covered with metal plates. When he was fully armed, he was    expected to show his skill to the lords and ladies who were present.    THE DUTIES OF A KNIGHT. The duties of the knight were to defend the    weak, to protect women from wrong, to be faithful to his lord and king,    and to be courteous even to an enemy. A knight true to these duties was    called \"chivalrous,\" a word which means very much what we mean by the    word \"gentlemanly.\" There were many wicked knights, but we must not    forget that the good knights taught courtesy, faithfulness in keeping    promises, respect for women, courage, self-sacrifice, and honor.      [Illustration: A Knight in Armor Thirteenth century]    THE PEASANTS. Most of the people were peasants or townsmen. There    were few towns, because many had been burned by the barbarian tribes    which broke into the Roman Empire, or had been destroyed in the later    wars. The peasants were crowded in villages close to the walls of some    castle or monastery. They paid dearly for the protection which the lord    of the castle or the abbot of the monastery gave them, for they were    obliged to work on his lands three days or more each week, and to bring    him eggs, chickens, and a little money several times a year. They also    gave him a part of their harvest.    THE TOWNSMEN. At first the towns belonged to lords, or abbots, or    bishops, but many towns drove out their lords and ruled themselves or    received officers from the king. When they ruled themselves, their towns    were called communes. The citizens agreed that whenever the town bell    was rung they would gather together. Any one who was absent was fined.    For "]]]
