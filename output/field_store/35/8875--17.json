The Count, greatly astonished, says: \"How is that?  Where didst thou get him?\" \"A knight whom I esteem highly gave him to  me, sire,\" says he. \"I have conducted him within this town, and he  is lodged at a burgher's house. He is a very courteous knight and the  handsomest man I ever saw. Even if I had given you my word and oath,  I could not half tell you how handsome he is.\" The Count replies: \"I  suppose and presume that he is not more handsome than I am.\" \"Upon my  word, sire,\" the sergeant says, \"you are very handsome and a gentleman.  There is not a knight in this country, a native of this land, whom you  do not excel in favour. But I dare maintain concerning this one that  he is fairer than you, if he were not beaten black and blue beneath his  hauberk, and bruised. In the forest he has been fighting single-handed  with eight knights, and leads away their eight horses. And there comes  with him a lady so fair that never lady was half so fair as she.\" [128]  When the Count hears this news, the desire takes him to go and see if  this is true or false. \"I never heard such a thing,\" says he; \"take me  now to his lodging-place, for certainly I wish to know if thou dost lie  or speak the truth.\" He replies: \"Right gladly, sire. This is the way  and the path to follow, for it is not far from here.\" \"I am anxious to  see them,\" says the Count. Then he comes down, and the squire gets off  his horse, and makes the Count mount in his place. Then he ran ahead  to tell Erec that the Count was coming to visit him. Erec's lodging was  rich indeed--the kind to which he was accustomed. There were many tapers  and candles lighted all about. The Count came attended by only three  companions. Erec, who was of gracious manners, rose to meet him, and  exclaimed: \"Welcome, sire!\" And the Count returned his salutation. They  both sat down side by side upon a soft white couch, where they chat with  each other. The Count makes him an offer and urges him to consent to  accept from him a guarantee for the payment of his expenses in the  town. But Erec does not deign to accept, saying he is well supplied with  money, and has no need to accept aught from him. They speak long of many  things, but the Count constantly glances about in the other direction,  where he caught sight of the lady. Because of her manifest beauty, he  fixed all his thought on her. He looked at her as much as he could;  he coveted her, and she pleased him so that her beauty filled him with  love. Very craftily he asked Erec for permission to speak with her.  \"Sire,\" he says \"I ask a favour of you, and may it not displease you. As  an act of courtesy and as a pleasure, I would fain sit by yonder lady's  side. With good intent I came to see you both, and you should see no  harm in that. I wish to present to the lady my service in all respects.  Know well that for love of you I would do whatever may please her.\" Erec  was not in the least jealous and suspected no evil or treachery. \"Sire,\"  says he, \"I have no objection. You may sit down and talk with her. Don't  think that I have any objection. I give you permission willingly.\" The  lady was seated about two spear-lengths away from him. And the Count  took his seat close beside her on a low stool. Prudent and courteous,  the lady turned toward him. \"Alas,\" quoth he, \"how grieved I am to see  you in such humble state! I am sorry and feel great distress. But if you  would believe my word, you could have honour and great advantage, and  much wealth would accrue to you. Such beauty as yours is entitled to  great honour and distinction. I would make you my mistress, if it should  please you and be your will; you would be my mistress dear and lady over  all my land. When I deign to woo you thus, you ought not to disdain my  suit. I know and perceive that your lord does not love and esteem you.  If you will remain with me, you would be mated with a worthy lord.\"  \"Sire,\" says Enide, \"your proposal is vain. It cannot be. Ah! better  that I were yet unborn, or burnt upon a fire of thorns and my ashes  scattered abroad than that I should ever in any wise be false to my  lord, or conceive any felony or treachery toward him. You have made a  great mistake in making such a proposal to me. I shall not agree to it  in any wise.\" The Count's ire began to rise. \"You disdain to love me,  lady?\" says he; \"upon my word, you are too proud. Neither for flattery  nor for prayer you will do my will? It is surely true that a woman's  pride mounts the more one prays and flatters her; but whoever insults  and dishonours her will often find her more tractable. I give you my  word that if you do not do my will there soon will be some sword-play  here. Rightly or wrongly, I will have your lord slain right here before  your eyes.\" \"Ah, sire,\" says Enide, \"there is a better way than that you  say. You would commit a wicked and treacherous deed if you killed him  thus. Calm yourself again, I pray; for I will do your pleasure. You  may regard me as all your own, for I am yours and wish to be. I did not  speak as I did from pride, but to learn and prove if I could find in you  the true love of a sincere heart. But I would not at any price have you  commit an act of treason. My lord is not on his guard; and if you should  kill him thus, you would do a very ugly deed, and I should have the  blame for it. Every one in the land would say that it had been done with  my consent. Go and rest until the morrow, when my lord shall be about  to rise. Then you can better do him harm without blame and without  reproach.\" With her heart's thoughts her words do not agree. \"Sire,\"  says she, \"believe me now! Have no anxiety; but send here to-morrow your  knights and squires and have me carried away by force. My lord will rush  to my defence, for he is proud and bold enough. Either in earnest or in  jest, have him seized and treated ill, or strike his head off, if you  will. I have led this life now long enough; to tell the truth. I like  not the company of this my lord. Rather would I feel your body lying  beside me in a bed. And since we have reached this point, of my love you  may rest assured.\" The Count replies: \"It is well, my lady! God bless  the hour that you were born; in great estate you shall be held.\" \"Sire,\"  says she, \"indeed, I believe it. And yet I would fain have your word  that you will always hold me dear; I could not believe you otherwise.\"  Glad and merry, the Count replies: \"See here, my faith I will pledge to  you loyally as a Count, Madame, that I shall do all your behests. Have  no further fear of that. All you want you shall always have.\" Then she  took his plighted word; but little she valued or cared for it, except  therewith to save her lord. Well she knows how to deceive a fool, when  she puts her mind upon it. Better it were to lie to him than that her  lord should be cut off. The Count now rose from her side, and commends  her to God a hundred times. But of little use to him will be the faith  which she has pledged to him. Erec knew nothing at all of this that they  were plotting to work his death; but God will be able to lend him aid,  and I think He will do so. Now Erec is in great peril, and does not know  that he must be on his guard. The Count's intentions are very base in  planning to steal away his wife and kill him when he is without defence.  In treacherous guise he takes his leave: \"To God I commend you,\" says  he, and Erec replies: \"And so do I you, sire.\" Thus they separated.  Already a good part of the night was passed. Out of the way, in one of  the rooms, two beds were made upon the floor. In one of them Erec lays  him down, in the other Enide went to rest. Full of grief and anxiety,  she never closed her eyes that night, but remained on watch for her  lord's sake; for from what she had seen of the Count, she knew him to be  full of wickedness. She knows full well that if he once gets possession  of her lord, he will not fail to do him harm. He may be sure of being  killed: so for his sake she is in distress. All night she must needs  keep her vigil; but before the dawn, if she can bring it about, and if  her lord will take her word, they will be ready to depart.    (Vv. 3459-3662.) Erec slept all night long securely until daylight. Then  Enide realised and suspected that she might hesitate too long. Her heart  was tender toward her lord, like a good and loyal lady. Her heart was  neither deceitful nor false. So she rises and makes ready, and drew near  to her lord to wake him up. \"Ah, sire,\" says she, \"I crave your  pardon. Rise quickly now, for you are betrayed beyond all doubt, though  guiltless and free from any crime. The Count is a proven traitor, and  if he can but catch you here, you will never get away without his having  cut you in pieces. He hates you because he desires me. But if it please  God, who knows all things, you shall be neither slain nor caught. Last  evening he would have killed you had I not assured him that I would be  his mistress and his wife. You will see him return here soon: he wants  to seize me and keep me here and kill you if he can find you.\" Now Erec  learns how loyal his wife is to him. \"Lady,\" says he, \"have our horses  quickly saddled; then run and call our host, and tell him quickly to  come here. Treason has been long abroad.\" Now the horses are saddled,  and the lady summoned the host. Erec has armed and dressed himself, and  into his presence came the host. \"Sire,\" said he, \"what haste is this,  that you are risen at such an hour, before the day and the sun appear?\"  Erec replies that he has a long road and a full day before him, and  therefore he has made ready to set out, having it much upon his mind;  and he added: \"Sire, you have nor yet handed me any statement of my  expenses. You have received me with honour and kindness, and therein  great merit redounds to you.

Then he seized a stick which lay conveniently near, and began  to rain blows down upon their heads, shoulders, and sides, all the time  dancing first on one leg, then on the other, and crying,    \"Villains! rascals! here are the hundred pounds I promised. How do you  like them? I' faith, you'll get all that's in the bag.\"    Whack! whack! whack! whack! went the stick, emphasizing each word. Howls  of pain might have gone up from the sufferers, but they had too much  meal in their throats for that. Their one thought was to flee, and they  stumbled off blindly down the road, the beggar following them a little  way to give them a few parting love-taps.    \"Fare ye well, my masters,\" he said finally turning the other way; \"and  when next I come along the Barnesdale road, I hope you will be able to  tell gold from meal dust!\"    With this he departed, an easy victor, and again went whistling on his  way, while the three outlaws rubbed the meal out of their eyes and began  to catch their breath again.    As soon as they could look around them clearly, they beheld Robin  Hood leaning against a tree trunk and surveying them smilingly. He had  recovered his own spirits in full measure, on seeing their plight.    \"God save ye, gossips!\" he said, \"ye must, in sooth, have gone the wrong  way and been to the mill, from the looks of your clothes.\"    Then when they looked shamefaced and answered never a word, he went on,  in a soft voice,    \"Did ye see aught of that bold beggar I sent you for, lately?\"    \"In sooth, master,\" responded Much the miller's son, \"we heard more of  him than we saw him. He filled us so full of meal that I shall sweat  meal for a week. I was born in a mill, and had the smell of meal in my  nostrils from my very birth, you might say, and yet never before did I  see such a quantity of the stuff in so small space.\"    And he sneezed violently.    \"How was that?\" asked Robin demurely.    \"Why we laid hold of the beggar, as you did order, when he offered to  pay for his release out of the bag he carried upon his back.\"    \"The same I coveted,\" quoth Robin as if to himself.    \"So we agreed to this,\" went on Much, \"and spread a cloak down, and he  opened his bag and shook it thereon. Instantly a great cloud of meal  filled the air, whereby we could neither see nor breathe; and in the  midst of this cloud he vanished like a wizard.\"    \"But not before he left certain black and blue spots, to be remembered  by, I see,\" commented Robin.    \"He was in league with the evil one,\" said one of the widow's sons,  rubbing himself ruefully.    Then Robin laughed outright, and sat him down upon the gnarled root of a  tree, to finish his merriment.    \"Four bold outlaws, put to rout by a sorry beggar!\" cried he. \"I can  laugh at ye, my men, for I am in the same boat with ye. But 'twould  never do to have this tale get abroad--even in the greenwood--how that  we could not hold our own with the odds in our favor. So let us have  this little laugh all to ourselves, and no one else need be the wiser!\"    The others saw the point of this, and felt better directly, despite  their itching desire to get hold of the beggar again. And none of the  four ever told of the adventure.    But the beggar must have boasted of it at the next tavern; or a little  bird perched among the branches of a neighboring oak must have sung  of it. For it got abroad, as such tales will, and was put into a right  droll ballad which, I warrant you, the four outlaws did not like to  hear.          CHAPTER XI    HOW ROBIN HOOD FOUGHT GUY OF GISBORNE         \"I dwell by dale and down,\" quoth he,       \"And Robin to take I'm sworn;       And when I am called by my right name,       I am Guy of good Gisborne.\"    Some weeks passed after the rescue of the widow's three sons; weeks  spent by the Sheriff in the vain effort to entrap Robin Hood and his  men. For Robin's name and deeds had come to the King's ears, in London  town, and he sent word to the Sheriff to capture the outlaw, under  penalty of losing his office. So the Sheriff tried every manner of means  to surprise Robin Hood in the forest, but always without success. And he  increased the price put upon Robin's head, in the hope that the best men  of the kingdom could be induced to try their skill at a capture.    Now there was a certain Guy of Gisborne, a hireling knight of the King's  army, who heard of Robin and of the price upon his head. Sir Guy was one  of the best men at the bow and the sword in all the King's service.  But his heart was black and treacherous. He obtained the King's leave  forthwith to seek out the forester; and armed with the King's scroll he  came before the Sheriff at Nottingham.    \"I have come to capture Robin Hood,\" quoth he, \"and mean to have him,  dead or alive.\"    \"Right gladly would I aid you,\" answered the Sheriff, \"even if the  King's seal were not sufficient warrant. How many men need you?\"    \"None,\" replied Sir Guy, \"for I am convinced that forces of men can  never come at the bold robber. I must needs go alone. But do you hold  your men in readiness at Barnesdale, and when you hear a blast from this  silver bugle, come quickly, for I shall have the sly Robin within my  clutches.\"    \"Very good,\" said the Sheriff. \"Marry, it shall be done.\" And he set  about giving orders, while Guy of Gisborne sallied forth disguised.    Now as luck would have it, Will Scarlet and Little John had gone to  Barnesdale that very day to buy suits of Lincoln green for certain of  the yeomen who had come out at the knees and elbows. But not deeming it  best for both of them to run their necks into a noose, together, they  parted just outside the town, and Will went within the gates, while John  tarried and watched at the brow of the hill on the outside.    Presently whom should he see but this same Will flying madly forth from  the gates again, closely pursued by the Sheriff and threescore men. Over  the moat Will sprang, through the bushes and briars, across the swamp,  over stocks and stones, up the woodland roads in long leaps like a  scared jack rabbit. And after him puffed the Sheriff and his men, their  force scattering out in the flight as one man would tumble head-first  into a ditch, another mire up in the swamp, another trip over a rolling  stone, and still others sit down on the roadside and gasp for wind like  fish out of water.    Little John could not forbear laughing heartily at the scene, though  he knew that 'twould be anything but a laughing matter if Will should  stumble. And in truth one man was like to come upon him. It was  William-a-Trent, the best runner among the Sheriff's men. He had come  within twenty feet of Scarlet and was leaping upon him with long bounds  like a greyhound, when John rose up quickly, drew his bow and let fly  one of his fatal shafts. It would have been better for William-a-Trent  to have been abed with sorrow--says the ballad--than to be that day in  the greenwood slade to meet with Little John's arrow. He had run his  last race.    The others halted a moment in consternation, when the shaft came  hurtling down from the hill; but looking up they beheld none save Little  John, and with a cry of fierce joy they turned upon him. Meanwhile Will  Scarlet had reached the brow of the hill and sped down the other side.    \"I'll just send one more little message of regret to the Sheriff,\" said  Little John, \"before I join Will.\"    But this foolhardy deed was his undoing, for just as the arrow left the  string, the good yew bow that had never before failed him snapped in  twain.    \"Woe worth, woe worth thee, wicked wood, that ere thou grew on a  tree!\" cursed Little John, and planted his feet resolutely in the earth  resolved to sell the path dearly; for the soldiers were now so close  upon him that he dared not turn.    And a right good account of himself he gave that day, dealing with  each man as he came up according to his merit. And so winded were the  pursuers when they reached the top of the hill that he laid out the  first ten of them right and left with huge blows of his brawny fist.    But if five men can do more than three, a score can overcome one.    A body of archers stood off at a prudent distance and covered Little  John with their arrows.    \"Now yield you!\" panted the Sheriff. \"Yield you, Little John, or Reynold  Greenleaf, or whatever else name you carry this day! Yield you, or some  few of these shafts will reach your heart!\"    \"Marry, my heart has been touched by your words ere now,\" said Little  John; \"and I yield me.\"    So the Sheriff's men laid hold of Little John and bound him fast with  many cords, so fearful were they lest he should escape. And the Sheriff  laughed aloud in glee, and thought of how he should avenge his stolen  plate, and determined to make a good day's work of it.    \"By the Saints!\" he said, \"you shall be drawn by dale and down, and  hanged high on a hill in Barnesdale this very day.\"    \"Hang and be hanged!\" retorted the prisoner. \"You may fail of your  purpose if it be Heaven's will.\"    Back down the hill and across the moor went the company speedily, for  they feared a rescue. And as they went the stragglers joined them. Here  a man got up feebly out of the ditch and rubbed his pate and fell in  like a chicken with the pip going for its dinner. Yonder came hobbling  a man with a lame ankle, or another with his shins torn by the briars or  another with his jacket all muddy from the marsh. So in truth it was  a tatterdemalion crew that limped and straggled and wandered back into  Barnesdale that day. Yet all were merry, for the Sheriff had promised  them flagons of wine, and moreover they were to hang speedily the  boldest outlaw in England, next to Robin Hood himself.    The gallows was quickly put up and a new rope provided.    \"Now up with you!\" commanded the Sheriff,"]]]
