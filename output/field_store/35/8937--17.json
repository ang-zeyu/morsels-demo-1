Let me do the rest now,\" said Duane.    The old outlaw eyed him sarcastically.    \"Thet 'd be turrible now, wouldn't it? If you want to know, why, I'm in  bad already. I didn't tell you thet Alloway called me last night. He's  gettin' wise pretty quick.\"    \"Euchre, you're going with me?\" queried Duane, suddenly divining the  truth.    \"Wal, I reckon. Either to hell or safe over the mountain! I wisht I was  a gun-fighter. I hate to leave here without takin' a peg at Jackrabbit  Benson. Now, Buck, you do some hard figgerin' while I go nosin' round.  It's pretty early, which 's all the better.\"    Euchre put on his sombrero, and as he went out Duane saw that he wore  a gun-and-cartridge belt. It was the first time Duane had ever seen the  outlaw armed.    Duane packed his few belongings into his saddlebags, and then carried  the saddles out to the corral. An abundance of alfalfa in the corral  showed that the horses had fared well. They had gotten almost fat during  his stay in the valley. He watered them, put on the saddles loosely  cinched, and then the bridles. His next move was to fill the two canvas  water-bottles. That done, he returned to the cabin to wait.    At the moment he felt no excitement or agitation of any kind. There was  no more thinking and planning to do. The hour had arrived, and he was  ready. He understood perfectly the desperate chances he must take.  His thoughts became confined to Euchre and the surprising loyalty and  goodness in the hardened old outlaw. Time passed slowly. Duane kept  glancing at his watch. He hoped to start the thing and get away before  the outlaws were out of their beds. Finally he heard the shuffle of  Euchre's boots on the hard path. The sound was quicker than usual.    When Euchre came around the corner of the cabin Duane was not so  astounded as he was concerned to see the outlaw white and shaking. Sweat  dripped from him. He had a wild look.    \"Luck ours--so-fur, Buck!\" he panted.    \"You don't look it,\" replied Duane.    \"I'm turrible sick. Jest killed a man. Fust one I ever killed!\"    \"Who?\" asked Duane, startled.    \"Jackrabbit Benson. An' sick as I am, I'm gloryin' in it. I went nosin'  round up the road. Saw Alloway goin' into Deger's. He's thick with the  Degers. Reckon he's askin' questions. Anyway, I was sure glad to see him  away from Bland's. An' he didn't see me. When I dropped into Benson's  there wasn't nobody there but Jackrabbit an' some greasers he was  startin' to work. Benson never had no use fer me. An' he up an' said he  wouldn't give a two-bit piece fer my life. I asked him why.    \"'You're double-crossin' the boss an' Chess,' he said.    \"'Jack, what 'd you give fer your own life?' I asked him.    \"He straightened up surprised an' mean-lookin'. An' I let him have it,  plumb center! He wilted, an' the greasers run. I reckon I'll never sleep  again. But I had to do it.\"    Duane asked if the shot had attracted any attention outside.    \"I didn't see anybody but the greasers, an' I sure looked sharp. Comin'  back I cut across through the cottonwoods past Bland's cabin. I meant to  keep out of sight, but somehow I had an idee I might find out if Bland  was awake yet. Sure enough I run plumb into Beppo, the boy who tends  Bland's hosses. Beppo likes me. An' when I inquired of his boss he said  Bland had been up all night fightin' with the Senora. An', Buck, here's  how I figger. Bland couldn't let up last night. He was sore, an' he went  after Kate again, tryin' to wear her down. Jest as likely he might have  went after Jennie, with wuss intentions. Anyway, he an' Kate must have  had it hot an' heavy. We're pretty lucky.\"    \"It seems so. Well, I'm going,\" said Duane, tersely.    \"Lucky! I should smiler Bland's been up all night after a most draggin'  ride home. He'll be fagged out this mornin', sleepy, sore, an' he won't  be expectin' hell before breakfast. Now, you walk over to his house.  Meet him how you like. Thet's your game. But I'm suggestin', if he comes  out an' you want to parley, you can jest say you'd thought over his  proposition an' was ready to join his band, or you ain't. You'll have  to kill him, an' it 'd save time to go fer your gun on sight. Might be  wise, too, fer it's likely he'll do thet same.\"    \"How about the horses?\"    \"I'll fetch them an' come along about two minnits behind you. 'Pears to  me you ought to have the job done an' Jennie outside by the time I git  there. Once on them hosses, we can ride out of camp before Alloway or  anybody else gits into action. Jennie ain't much heavier than a rabbit.  Thet big black will carry you both.\"    \"All right. But once more let me persuade you to stay--not to mix any  more in this,\" said Duane, earnestly.    \"Nope. I'm goin'. You heard what Benson told me. Alloway wouldn't give  me the benefit of any doubts. Buck, a last word--look out fer thet Bland  woman!\"    Duane merely nodded, and then, saying that the horses were ready, he  strode away through the grove. Accounting for the short cut across grove  and field, it was about five minutes' walk up to Bland's house. To  Duane it seemed long in time and distance, and he had difficulty in  restraining his pace. As he walked there came a gradual and subtle  change in his feelings. Again he was going out to meet a man in  conflict. He could have avoided this meeting. But despite the fact of  his courting the encounter he had not as yet felt that hot, inexplicable  rush of blood. The motive of this deadly action was not personal, and  somehow that made a difference.    No outlaws were in sight. He saw several Mexican herders with cattle.  Blue columns of smoke curled up over some of the cabins. The fragrant  smell of it reminded Duane of his home and cutting wood for the stove.  He noted a cloud of creamy mist rising above the river, dissolving in  the sunlight.    Then he entered Bland's lane.    While yet some distance from the cabin he heard loud, angry voices of  man and woman. Bland and Kate still quarreling! He took a quick survey  of the surroundings. There was now not even a Mexican in sight. Then  he hurried a little. Halfway down the lane he turned his head to peer  through the cottonwoods. This time he saw Euchre coming with the horses.  There was no indication that the old outlaw might lose his nerve at the  end. Duane had feared this.    Duane now changed his walk to a leisurely saunter. He reached the porch  and then distinguished what was said inside the cabin.    \"If you do, Bland, by Heaven I'll fix you and her!\" That was panted out  in Kate Bland's full voice.    \"Let me looser I'm going in there, I tell you!\" replied Bland, hoarsely.    \"What for?\"    \"I want to make a little love to her. Ha! ha! It'll be fun to have the  laugh on her new lover.\"    \"You lie!\" cried Kate Bland.    \"I'm not saying what I'll do to her AFTERWARD!\" His voice grew hoarser  with passion. \"Let me go now!\"    \"No! no! I won't let you go. You'll choke the--the truth out of  her--you'll kill her.\"    \"The TRUTH!\" hissed Bland.    \"Yes. I lied. Jen lied. But she lied to save me. You needn't--murder  her--for that.\"    Bland cursed horribly. Then followed a wrestling sound of bodies in  violent straining contact--the scrape of feet--the jangle of spurs--a  crash of sliding table or chair, and then the cry of a woman in pain.    Duane stepped into the open door, inside the room. Kate Bland lay half  across a table where she had been flung, and she was trying to get to  her feet. Bland's back was turned. He had opened the door into Jennie's  room and had one foot across the threshold. Duane caught the girl's low,  shuddering cry. Then he called out loud and clear.    With cat-like swiftness Bland wheeled, then froze on the threshold.  His sight, quick as his action, caught Duane's menacing unmistakable  position.    Bland's big frame filled the door. He was in a bad place to reach for  his gun. But he would not have time for a step. Duane read in his eyes  the desperate calculation of chances. For a fleeting instant Bland  shifted his glance to his wife. Then his whole body seemed to vibrate  with the swing of his arm.    Duane shot him. He fell forward, his gun exploding as it hit into the  floor, and dropped loose from stretching fingers. Duane stood over him,  stooped to turn him on his back. Bland looked up with clouded gaze, then  gasped his last.    \"Duane, you've killed him!\" cried Kate Bland, huskily. \"I knew you'd  have to!\"    She staggered against the wall, her eyes dilating, her strong hands  clenching, her face slowly whitening. She appeared shocked, half  stunned, but showed no grief.    \"Jennie!\" called Duane, sharply.    \"Oh--Duane!\" came a halting reply.    \"Yes. Come out. Hurry!\"    She came out with uneven steps, seeing only him, and she stumbled over  Bland's body. Duane caught her arm, swung her behind him. He feared  the woman when she realized how she had been duped. His action was  protective, and his movement toward the door equally as significant.    \"Duane,\" cried Mrs. Bland.    It was no time for talk. Duane edged on, keeping Jennie behind him. At  that moment there was a pounding of iron-shod hoofs out in the lane.  Kate Bland bounded to the door. When she turned back her amazement was  changing to realization.    \"Where 're you taking Jen?\" she cried, her voice like a man's. \"Get out  of my way,\" replied Duane. His look perhaps, without speech, was enough  for her. In an instant she was transformed into a fury.    \"You hound! All the time you were fooling me! You made love to me! You  let me believe--you swore you loved me! Now I see what was queer about  you. All for that girl! But you can't have her. You'll never leave here  alive. Give me that girl! Let me--get at her! She'll never win any more  men in this camp.\"    She was a powerful woman, and it took all Duane's strength to ward off  her onslaughts. She clawed at Jennie over his upheld "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10317"],[0,"Betty Gordon at Boarding School; Or, The Treasure of Indian Chasm (#16)"],[1,"to greater effort.    \"Come on,\" cried Betty gaily, taking the gymnasium steps two at a time.  \"Come, girls--this afternoon we go rowing. I've my 'stiffcut,' as Mr.  Peabody used to call it, and we've all passed. Oh, it's cloudy!\"    She looked at the sky disappointedly. When they had gone into the pool an  hour before the sun had been shining brightly, but now the gray clouds  were thick overhead and the air was chilly.    \"Who cares for the weather?\" said Bobby scornfully. \"Guess it will take  more than a little rain to stop me! I've been crazy to take a row-boat  out for three weeks.\"    \"Perhaps it will clear,\" contributed the optimistic Louise.    But after lunch the sky was still overcast.    \"Don't be silly--it won't rain,\" urged Bobby, as her chums demurred.  \"Next Saturday it may be too cold. Oh, come on, girls.\"    Thus incited, they went down to the wharf and made their choice of boats.  Norma and Alice wanted to take out a canoe, and they offered to paddle  for Libbie, who seemed disinclined to exercise. Betty had wondered once  or twice if the girl were ill, for she seemed very nervous, jumped if a  door slammed or some one spoke to her suddenly, and in the morning looked  as if she had not slept well.    Betty and Bobby selected a flat-bottomed row-boat and for passenger they  took Frances, who offered to help row if they became tired.    Louise and Constance chose another canoe.    They headed north, and once out in the center of the lake, paddled  and rowed steadily. Betty's rowing experience was limited, but Bobby  was proud of her \"stroke,\" and soon taught her chum the secret of  handling the oars.    \"Ship ahoy!\" shouted Bobby presently.    Libbie jumped and looked ahead anxiously.    \"It's only the boys,\" she said dully.    An eight-oared rowing shell shot down to them, and the freckled-faced  coxswain, Gilbert Lane, one of the boys the girls had met at Bob and  Tommy's \"party,\" grinned cheerfully.    \"Where you going?\" he asked, resting a friendly hand on the  rowboat's rim.    Bobby described an arc with her oar that incidentally showered the  questioner with shining water drops.    \"We're out for adventure,\" she answered airily.    \"Just got our swimming certificates to-day,\" volunteered Betty.    Bob flashed her a congratulatory smile.    \"Race you to the end of the lake?\" suggested Tommy Tucker.    Bobby regarded him with magnificent scorn.    \"As if eight of you couldn't beat two!\" she said significantly. \"I never  heard such talk! Why you'd have a walk!\" she added.    The boys shouted with laughter.    \"You're a poet, Bobby,\" declared Tommy. \"Tennyson had nothing on  you--had he, Libbie?\"    Libbie turned her dark eyes on him and frowned a little.    \"I wasn't listening,\" she said indifferently.    \"Well, anyway, row up to the end of the lake, will you?\" suggested  Gilbert. \"With drill night ahead of us, we want a little brightness to  remember the day by.\"    Canoes, rowboat and shell swept on up the lake, and when the scrubby  pines that bordered the narrow peak of the north shore were in sight,  Bobby glanced back over her shoulder at Betty.    \"You're spattering me,\" she complained.    \"I thinks it's beginning to rain,\" said Betty mildly, and even as she  spoke, Louise called to them:    \"Girls, it's beginning to pour!\"    A sudden blast of wind struck them, blowing the rain against their backs.    \"Keep on rowing!\" shouted Bob's voice. \"We'll have to land and walk back.  You girls can never beat back against this storm. We're almost to the  shore now.\"    A few minutes more and the boats touched shore. The boys were out in an  instant and helped the girls to land.    \"We'll carry up the boats--don't you think that is best, Tommy?\" shouted  Bob. \"If we carry them up high enough and leave them, they will be  perfectly safe.\"    The wind and the rain made shouting necessary if one's voice were to  carry above the storm. The boys lifted the light boats and carried them  into the woods, turning them over so that the keels were up.    \"Now the question is,\" said Bob, who seemed by common consent to have  been elected leader, \"shall we walk along the shore and get drenched, or  take a chance of finding our way through the woods?\"    To their astonishment, Libbie burst into a fit of hysterical weeping.    \"Don't go through the woods,\" she begged, her teeth chattering. \"We'll  fall into that awful Indian Chasm.\"    Bobby's heart reproached her for her thoughtless joke and she put an arm  around her cousin.    \"Libbie, you never thought I was serious about pushing you into the  chasm, did you?\" she asked anxiously. \"Is that what has been making you  act so queerly ever since? I was only fooling.\"    So, thought Betty, Bobby, too, had noticed Libbie's unnatural behavior.    \"Oh, it isn't that,\" sobbed Libbie. \"I can't explain--but if we go  through the woods, I'm sure I shall go crazy.\"    \"Well, then, that settles it,\" said Bob comfortably. \"Better to be  drowned than to go crazy. Can you turn up your sweater collars, girls? I  wish we'd brought some raincoats along.\"    Splashing and stumbling, they followed Bob down to the shore and began  the weary walk that would lead them back to the school. After fifteen  minutes' steady walking they came to a dense undergrowth that was  impossible to penetrate.    \"No use, we'll have to make a cut through the woods,\" announced Bob. \"Up  this way and over, ought to bring us out right.\"    He was so cheerful and patient that the tired, rain-soaked girls could  not do otherwise than follow his example. Libbie was crying silently, but  the others tramped along cheerfully, singing, at Betty's suggestion, old  college and school songs.    \"Look here, Bob,\" said Tommy Tucker in an undertone, \"I don't think we're  going in the right direction. Don't you say it would be better to take  the girls to that deserted cabin we found the other day and leave them  there while we explore a bit? They're getting soaked through, and Libbie  Littell is fixing to have hysterics. Leave a couple of the boys with 'em,  so they won't be afraid, and then we'll locate the right trail and take  'em over it home in a hurry.\"    This suggestion sounded like good, common-sense to Bob, and he said so.    \"Betty could walk ten miles and be all right,\" he declared proudly, \"and  I think Bobby is good for a hike, too. But Frances Martin can't see when  the rain gets on her glasses, and, as you say, something is the matter  with Libbie. So let's make for the cabin, quick.\"    The Salsette boys had explored the woods pretty thoroughly, and on a  recent expedition Bob and his chums had stumbled on an old one-room  cabin, buried deep in the woods and evidently unoccupied for years. It  was not far from the end of the lake, and toward it they now led the  girls, explaining as they went what they intended to do.    \"We'll be all right,\" said Betty at once. \"I think if Libbie can sit down  and rest she'll feel better, too. And if you all want to go and hunt for  the trail, you needn't worry about us.\"    \"Oh, Sydney and I intend to stay,\" Gilbert Lane assured her quickly. (The  boys had settled that among themselves.) \"We'll be handy in case any  Indians or the like come after you.\"    Betty gave him a warning glance, for Libbie looked frightened. Surely  something was wrong with the girl!    The cabin door was open and the interior was comparatively dry. There was  no furniture, but three or four old packing boxes furnished the girls  with seats. Bob and five of his friends disappeared, whistling. Gilbert  and Sydney were investigating the ramshackle fireplace to see what the  prospects were for starting a fire when a shriek from Libbie brought them  to their feet.    \"A ghost!\" cried the girl. \"A ghost! Over there in the corner!\"    Frances Martin gave a cry, and Betty and Bobby went white. Even Gilbert  afterward confessed that his scalp prickled when a figure stepped forward  from a narrow closet against the wall.    \"Ugh! Howdy!\" he grunted, and they saw that he was a very old and very  dirty Indian.    \"Rain,\" he said slowly, pointing to the door. \"Stop soon now. Go  get supper.\"    He shuffled over the doorsill and at the edge he turned.    \"Howdy!\" he said, apparently with some vague idea of farewell.  \"Much rain!\"    Petrified, they watched him hobble away through the woods.          CHAPTER XVIII    LIBBIE'S SECRET      Gilbert Lane was the first to recover his voice.    \"Well, what do you know about that!\" he ejaculated. \"The old bird was  here all the time.\"    \"Are--are--are there any more of them?\" stammered Louise.    \"No, that old fellow is the only Indian for miles around,\" said Gilbert  carelessly. \"He was left behind, the fellows at school say, when that  band stole the Macklin treasure. They had a grudge against him, it seems,  and they tripped him and left him with a broken leg. He worked around on  different farms for years and now does a day's work often enough to keep  him in food. Queer old dick, I guess.\"    \"What makes you girls look so funny?\" demanded Sydney. \"You're not afraid  now, are you? That Indian won't come back--he was more afraid of us than  we were of him. I figure out he was asleep when we came in and the noise  woke him up. What are you smiling about?\"    \"My grandmother is Mrs. Marcia Macklin,\" explained Norma. \"And you see  it was her gold and silver and jewels the Indians stole. I wonder what he  would have said if we had told him?\"    \"Gee, is that so?\" asked Sydney, ignoring the latter half of Norma's  sentence. \"And is all that stuff down in the chasm yet?\"    \"As far as we know, it is,\" said Norma. \"And likely to remain there,\" she  added, with a sigh.    Bob and the boys returned in less than half an hour, to announce that  they had found the right road and were prepared to pilot the girls  expeditiously homeward. Libbie's cheeks were unnaturally flushed and she  looked miserable, but she refused to let Bob and Tommy carry her by"]]]
