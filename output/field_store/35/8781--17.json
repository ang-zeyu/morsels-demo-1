All were busy,  and it was not until after eleven that evening that they turned  in.    The day for the departure from Boma dawned bright and clear, and  Cujo appeared with his assistants while they were still eating  breakfast.    \"Werry good day for um journey,\" he said, with a grin.  \"Make good  many miles if nothing go wrong.\"    \"You can't do any too well for me,\" answered Dick.  \"I hope our  expedition into the interior is both short and successful.\"    At eight o'clock they were off.  At first they had thought to go  on horseback; but this was abandoned by the advice of the native,  who declared that horses would prove more of a drag than a help in  many places.    \"Horse canno' climb tree bridge,\" he explained.  \"No climb high  rock, no go around bad hill. We go on foot an' make better time.\"    The town was soon left behind and they struck a highway which for  several miles afforded easy traveling.  On all sides were dense  groves of tropical growth, palms, mangoes, and the like, with  enormous vines festooned from one tree to the next.  Underneath  were a great variety, of ferns and mosses, the homes of countless  insects and small animals.  The ground was black and wherever  turned up gave forth a sickly odor of decayed vegetation.    \"That is regular fever territory,\" explained Randolph Rover.  \"Boys, do not sleep on the ground if you can possibly avoid it.  I  sincerely trust that none of us take the tropical fever.\"    \"If I feel it coming on I'll take a good dose of quinine,\"  declared Tom.    Fortunately they had brought along a good supply of that valuable  drug.    Two days traveling passed without special incident.  On one side  of the highway was the broad river, which glinted like molten lead  in the sunshine.  They could not travel very close to its bank,  for here the ground was uncertain. Once Sam left the highway to  get a better view of the stream, and, before Cujo noticed it,  found himself up to his knees in a muck which stuck to him like so  much glue.    \"Hi! help me out!\" roared the youngest Rover, and all of the party  turned, to behold him waving his hand frantically toward them.    \"He dun got stuck in de mud!\" exclaimed Aleck, and started to go  to Sam's assistance, when Cujo called him back.    \"Must be werry careful,\" said the native.  \"Ground bad over  dare--lose life if urn don't have a care.  Wait fo' me.\"  And he  approached Sam by a circuitous route over the tufts of grass  which grew like so many dots amid the swamp.  Soon he was close  enough to throw the youth the end of a rope he carried.  The pull  that, followed nearly took Sam's arms out by the sockets; but the  boy was saved, to return to the others of the party with an  experience which was destined to be very useful to him in, the  future.    \"It will teach me to be careful of where I am going after this,\"  he declared.  \"Why, that bog looked almost as safe as the ground  over here!\"    \"Tropical places are all full of just such treacherous swamps,\"  returned Randolph Rover.  \"It will be wise for all of us to  remember that we are now in a strange territory and that we must  have our eyes and ears wide open.\"    At half-past eleven they came to a halt for dinner.  The sun was  now almost overhead, and they were glad enough to seek the shelter  of a number of palms standing in front of a--native hostelry.    \"We will rest here until two o'clock,\" said Mr. Rover.  \"It is all  out of the question to travel in the heat of the day, as we did  yesterday, in such a climate as this.  Even the natives cannot  stand that.\"    They found the hostelry presided over by a short, fat native who  scarcely spoke a word of English.  But he could speak French, and  Mr. Rover spoke to him in that language, while Cujo carried on a  talk in the native tongue.  The midday repast was cooked over a  fire built between several stones.  The boys watched the cooking  process with interest and were surprised to find, when it came to  eating, that the food prepared tasted so good.  They had antelope  steak and a generous supply of native bread, and pure cocoa, which  Tom declared as good as chocolate.    After the meal they took it easy in a number of grass hammocks  stretched beneath the wide spreading palms surrounding the wayside  inn, if such it might be called.  Aleck and Cujo fell to smoking  and telling each other stories, while the Rovers dozed away, lulled  to sleep by the warm, gentle breeze which was blowing.    \"I don't wonder the natives are lazy,\" remarked Dick, when his  uncle aroused him.  \"I rarely slept in the daytime at home, and  here I fell off without half trying.\"    \"The climate is very enervating, Dick.  That is why this section  of the globe makes little or no progress toward civilization.  Energetic men come here, with the best intention in the world of  hustling, as it is termed, but soon their ambition oozes out of  them like--well, like molasses out of a barrel lying on a hot  dock in the sun.    \"A good comparison,\" laughed Dick.    \"Come, Tom; come, Sam!\" he called out, and soon the party was on  its way again.    The highway was still broad, but now it was not as even as before,  and here and there they had to leap over just such a treacherous  swamp as had caused Sam so much trouble.  \"It's a good thing we  didn't bring the horses,\" said Mr. Rover.  \"I didn't think so  before, but I do now.\"    The jungle was filled with countless birds, of all sorts, sizes,  and colors.  Some of these sang in a fairly tuneful fashion, but  the majority uttered only sounds which were as painful to the  hearing as they were tiresome.    \"The sound is enough to drive a nervous fellow crazy,\" declared  Tom.  \"It's a good thing nature fixed it so that a man can't grow  up nervous here.\"    \"Perhaps those outrageous cries are meant to wake a chap up,\"  suggested Dick.    \"I've a good mind to shoot some of the little pests.\"    \"You may take a few shots later on and see what you can bring down  for supper,\" answered his uncle.  \"But just now let us push on as  fast as we can.\"    \"Yes,\" put in Tom.  \"Remember we are out here to find father, not  to hunt.\"    \"As if I would ever forget that,\" answered Dick, with a  reproachful glance.    They were now traveling a bit of a hill which took them, temporarily,  out of sight of the Congo.  Cujo declared this was a short route  and much better to travel than the other.  The way was through a  forest of African teak wood, immense trees which seemed to tower  to the very skies.    \"They are as large as the immense trees of California of which you  have all heard,\" remarked Randolph Rover.  \"It is a very useful  wood, used extensively in ship building.\"    \"After all, I think a boat on the Congo would have been better to  use than shoe leather,\" said Sam, who was beginning to grow tired.    \"No use a boat when come to falls,\" grinned Cujo.  \"Soon come to  dem, too.\"    Aleck had been dragging behind, carrying a heavy load, to which  he was unaccustomed.  Now he rejoined the others with the  announcement that another party was in their rear.    \"They are on foot, too,\" he said.  \"Cujo whar you dun t'ink da be  gwine?\"    \"To the next settlement, maybe,\" was Randolph Rover's comment,  and Cujo nodded.    They waited a bit for the other party to come up, but it did not,  and, after walking back, Cujo returned with the announcement that  they were nowhere in sight.    \"Perhaps they turned off on a side road,\" said Tom, and there the  matter was dropped, to be brought to their notice very forcibly  that night.    Evening found them at another hostelry, presided over by a  Frenchman who had a giant negress for a wife.  The pair were a  crafty looking couple, and did not at all please the Rovers.    \"Perhaps we may as well sleep with one eye open tonight,\" said  Randolph Rover, upon retiring.  \"We are in a strange country, and  it's good advice to consider every man an enemy until he proves  himself a friend.\"    The hostelry was divided into half a dozen rooms, all on the  ground floor.  The Rovers were placed in two adjoining apartments,  while the natives and Aleck were quartered in an addition of  bamboo in the rear.    \"Keep your eyes and ears open, Aleck,\" whispered Dick, on  separating from the faithful colored man.  \"And if you find  anything wrong let us know at once.\"    \"Do you suspect anyt'ing, Massah Rober?\" was Pop's anxious  question.    \"I do and I don't.  Something in the air seems to tell me that  everything is not as it should be.\"    \"Dat Frenchman don't look like no angel, sah,\" and Aleck shook his  head doubtfully.    \"You're right, Aleck, and his wife is a terror, or else I miss my  guess.\"    \"Dat's right, Massah Rober; nebber saw sech sharp eyes.  Yes, I'll  look out-fo' my own sake as well as fo' de sake ob Ye and de  rest,\" concluded Aleck.          CHAPTER XVII    THE ATTACK AT THE HOSTELRY      The night was exceptionally cool for that locality; and, utterly  worn out by their tiresome journey, all of the Rovers slept more  soundly than they had anticipated.    But not for long.  Dick had scarcely dropped off when he heard a  noise at the doorway, which was covered with a rough grass  curtain.    \"Who is there?\" he demanded, sitting up.    \"Dat's all right,\" came in a whisper from Aleck.  \"Is dat yo',  Massah Dick?\"    \"Yes, Aleck.  What brings you?\"    \"I dun discovered somet'ing, sah.\"    \"What?\"    \"Dat udder party dun come up an' is in de woods back ob dis,  house.\"    \"In camp?\"    \"No; dare is a Frenchman wot is talkin' to dah chap wot runs dis  shebang, sah.\"    \"Perhaps he wants accommodations,\" mused Dick.    \"Can't say about dat, sah.  But de fellers who come up hab a lot  ob ropes wid 'em.\"    \"That's certainly queer.\"    \"What's the row?\" came sleepily from Tom, and presently Randolph  Rover and Sam"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5780"],[0,"The Rover Boys at School; Or, The Cadets of Putnam Hall (#15)"],[1,"fly.  \"I prefer a quiet wedding,  and no time is better than the present.  I shall at once resign my  position at Putnam Hall and come to live here.\"    Dora Stanhope's lip curled in scorn.  She saw through Josiah  Crabtree's motives, even though her mother did not.    \"If you wish to marry my mother, why do you not make preparations  to support her?\" she said.    \"Dora!\" cried Mrs. Stanhope pleadingly.    \"I mean what I say, mother.  He intends to marry you and then make  you support him, out of the proceeds of this farm.\"    \"You are entirely mistaken,\" interrupted Josiah Crabtree.  \"Perhaps you do not know that I am worth, in bank stocks and in  bonds, between twenty and thirty thousand dollars.\"    \"I would like to see the stocks and bonds,\" said the girl.    \"So would I,\" whispered Fred to Sam.  \"I'll wager he isn't worth a  thousand dollars all told although they say he is a good deal of a  miser.\"    \"Dora, do not insult Mr. Crabtree.  If you wish to come along and  see the ceremony performed, put on your things....\"    \"I do not wish to go.\"    \"Very well, then; you had best return to the house.\"    \"It is a shame!\" cried the girl, and burst into tears.    \"We will be back by seven o'clock,\" said Josiah Crabtree, and led  the widow down the garden path to where the carriage was standing.    \"I wish I could stop this wedding,\" whispered Sam to his chum.    \"I am with you on that,\" returned Fred.    \"Creation, here come the hounds!  Just the thing!\"    He looked at Sam, and his chum, instantly understood.  Leaving the  porch at a bound, they ran across the garden.    \"Hurrah! we have you!\" yelled Larry Colby, as he rushed up,  followed by Tom, Dick, and a dozen of the other big cadets.    \"Quick, this way!\" cried Sam.  \"Do you see that carriage?\"    \"Of course we do,\" answered Tom.    \"It contains Mrs. Stanhope and old Crabtree.  They are going to  drive off and get married against Dora Stanhope's wishes.\"    \"Phew!\" came in a low whistle from the eldest of the Rover Boys.    \"We ought to stop this affair,\" went on Fred.    \"Old Crabby is going to get married!\" came in a shout.  \"Come on,  let us go along!\"    And pell-mell went the boys after the carriage, which had just  turned from the horse-block with the teacher and Mrs. Stanhope  inside, and a farmhand named Borgy on the front seat.          CHAPTER XIV    JOSIAH CRABTREE IN DIFFICULTY      Dora Stanhope had witnessed the approach of the boys, and now she  came out into the garden again and confronted them.  She blushed  prettily upon seeing Dick and several others with whom she was  acquainted.    \"I understand that Mr. Crabtree is about to be married,\" said Dick  in a low tone.    \"Yes, he insists on marrying my mother this afternoon.  He has  been at her about this for several months,\" answered Dora between  her sobs.    \"Evidently you oppose the marriage.\"    \"I--I hate Mr. Crabtree!\" came almost fiercely.  \"He is--is  nothing like my poor dead papa was.\"    \"I believe you, Dora,\" answered Dick.  \"I don't see what your  mother can find in him to like.  We hate him at the academy.\"    \"I know it--and I imagine Captain Putnam is preparing to get rid of  him, for I heard he was corresponding with a teacher in Buffalo--one  who has been head master in a military academy out in that vicinity.\"    \"Indeed!  I hope we do get clear of him--and I wish you could  get clear of him too.\"    \"It doesn't seem as if I could,\" sighed Dora.  \"He has wound my  mother right around his finger, so to speak.  But what are those  other boys going to do?\"  And she pointed to the balance of the  cadets, who were following closely upon the wheels of the  carriage, which had turned into the highway leading to Cedarville.    \"I'll go after them and see,\" said Dick, and turned to leave.  Then he came to a halt and turned back.  \"Dora, I am awfully sorry  for you,\" he whispered.  \"If I can ever do anything for you, don't  hesitate to call on me.\"    \"I'll remember that, Dick,\" she replied gratefully, but never  dreamed of how much she would one day require his aid.    When Dick joined the crowd he found it on all sides of the  carriage, shouting and hurrahing wildly.  At first Josiah Crabtree  pretended to pay no attention, but presently he spoke to the  driver, and the turnout came to a halt.    \"Students, what does this unseemly conduct mean?\" he demanded  harshly.    \"Why, Mr. Crabtree, is that you!\" exclaimed Frank Harrington in  pretended surprise.    \"Yes, Harrington.  I say, what does it mean?\"    \"We are out playing hare and hounds, sir.\"    \"But you are following this carriage.\"    \"Oh, no, sir, we are following the paper scent, sir,\" answered  Larry Colby, and pointed to the pieces of paper, which Fred  Harrison was slyly dropping just in front of the horses.    \"Then our carriage is on the trail,\" sighed Josiah Crabtree.  \"It  is very annoying.\"    \"Oh, it doesn't bother us much, sir,\" answered Frank coolly.    \"Bother you!  It is myself and Mrs. Stanhope to whom I referred.  Make the hares take another course.\"    \"Can't do that, sir, until we catch them.\"    \"But why must you keep so close to this carriage?\"    \"I don't know, sir.  Perhaps it is the carriage which is keeping  close to us.\"    Josiah Crabtree looked more angry than ever.  He spoke to the  driver, with a view to increasing the speed of the team, but Borgy  had entered into the spirit of the fun at hand, and he was,  moreover, a great friend of Dora, and he shook his head.  \"Couldn't do it sir,\" he said.  \"I wouldn't want to run the risk  of winding them.\"    \"Do you mean to say they cannot outrun these boys?\" demanded the  head assistant at Putnam Hall.    \"Hardly, sir--the lads is uncommonly good runners,\" answered  Borgy meekly.    \"I will show you how to manage them!\" ejaculated Josiah Crabtree,  and stepped over to the front seat.    \"Oh, Josiah, be careful!\" pleaded Mrs. Stanhope.    \"I know how to drive horses, so don't worry,\" answered Crabtree,  and took up both reins and whip.  Before Borgy could stop him he  had given one of the horses a smart cut on the flank.    The steed was a spirited one and not used to the whip, and  scarcely had the lash landed than he gave a wild leap into the  air, came down, and broke into a mad run, dragging his mate with  him.  A second later the carriage struck a stone, bounced up, and  Borgy was pitched out, to land in the midst of some bushes growing  by the roadside.    The bolting of the team proved almost fatal to the boys in front,  who scattered just in time to let horses and carriage pass them  with lightning-like speed.  Then the cadets gathered together and  stared blankly at one another.    \"It's a runaway!\"    \"Serves old Crabby right, for hitting the horse!\"    \"Yes, but he and the lady may be killed!\"    Such were some of the cries.  As soon as they could recover, the  whole party made after the carriage, now disappearing around a  bend.    \"They'll never get around the next turn alive!\" said Captain Harry  Blossom, who was running beside Tom.  Soon Dick joined the pair.    In the meantime Josiah Crabtree was filled with terror over the  sudden turn of affairs.  He dropped the whip and tugged first at  one rein and then the other.    \"Whoa! whoa!\" he cried in a hoarse whisper.  \"Whoa!\"    But instead of slackening their speed, the team moved on faster  than ever, the carriage rocking violently from side to side.    \"We will be killed!\" moaned Mrs. Stanhope.  \"Oh, why did I not  take Dora's advice and have a regular wedding, as she proposed!\"    \"I will--will stop them!\" panted Crabtree.  \"Whoa, you brutes,  whoa!\"    \"Whoa, Peter; whoa, Jack!\" added Mrs. Stanhope timidly.    For an instant the horses seemed to take notice of the lady's  voice, but only for an instant; then they went on as fast as ever,  around another bend, and down a rocky stretch, lined on either  side with trees and bushes.    Suddenly there came a crash, as a wheel came off the carriage.  Then came a second crash and Mrs. Stanhope was hurled forth among  some bushes.  But the turnout continued on its way, Josiah  Crabtree clinging to the wreck, until at last he too was hurled  forth, to fly up among some tree branches and remain there for the  best part of ten minutes.    When the crowd of cadets reached Mrs. Stanhope they found the lady  unconscious and evidently suffering from a broken arm.  Several of  them, including Dick, Tom, and Sam, did what they could for her,  while others ran off to find Josiah Crabtree and to summon a  doctor.    It was several minutes before the head assistant at Putnam Hall  could be helped out of the tree.  He came down in fear and  trembling, so overcome he could scarcely stand.    \"How--how is Mrs. Stanhope?\" was his, first question.    \"We don't know,\" answered several of the cadets, and Josiah  Crabtree hobbled back to find out.    The shades of night had long fallen when Mrs. Stanhope was  conveyed to her home, and a doctor was brought from Cedarville and  the Lanings were informed of what had happened.  The doctor said  that a rib as well as the left arm had been fractured, and that  the lady must be kept quiet for at least two months.  At once Dora  set about doing what she could for her mother, and Nellie Laning  remained at the homestead to assist her.  No one seemed to care  about Josiah Crabtree, and he was allowed to hobble back to Putnam  Hall on foot.    \"It was the fault of those boys,\" he muttered to himself.  \"I'll  get even with them, see if I don't!\"    But his chances of \"getting even\" while at the academy were  speedily nipped in the bud by Captain Putnam, who did not say  anything on Sunday, but interviewed the head assistant early on  the day following.    \"It is perhaps needless for us to go into the details of what has  occurred, Mr. Crabtree,\" said the owner of the Hall.  \"Your  contract with me comes to an end next month.  I will pay you in  full tomorrow and then I wish you to remove yourself and your"]]]
