There must be a great deal of printing always going on in the Bank  of France, seeing that in 1868 they issued 2,711 000 notes, of an  aggregate value of 904,750,000 francs (averaging about L13 each), and  burned 1,927,192, value 768,854,900 francs.    It _sounds_ a very dreadful thing for 30,000,000 sterling in bank notes  to be willfully burned in one year. But there is always a phoenix to  rise from its ashes; the bank can regenerate as fast as it kills. The  Bank of France, in 1846, put in circulation a beautiful crimson printed  note for 5,000 francs; but the French people did not like notes of so  high a denomination, and all but a very few of this kind have been  returned and canceled. On one occasion, a superb individual, wishing to  pay a dowry in handsome style, obtained twelve notes of 5,000 francs  each for the purpose; but they were returned the very next day by the  banker, who much preferred smaller notes for his general purposes. The  notes now regularly kept in circulation in France are those of 1,000,  500, 100, and 50 francs.           *       *       *       *       *          WHAT THE NEWSPAPERS SAY.      A VALUABLE PAPER.--Of all the journals published in the United States,  for the mechanic and scientific man, there is nothing that will in any  way compare with the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, published by Munn & Co., of 37  Park Row, New York. Whether as a work of reference, a record of current  scientific development, or as an organ and exponent of our inventors, it  stands alone for the general ability of its conduct, the voluminousness  and variety of its contents, the exactitude and extent of its knowledge,  and the correctness of its information. The SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN is a  credit at once to the press and our country, and the small price of  a yearly subscription ($3), purchases, it is quite safe to say, the  largest amount of solid value to be procured for a like expenditure in  the world. With our more intelligent mechanics it has long been a great  favorite, while to the inventor it is absolutely indispensable. It has  had many imitators and competitors in its day, but they have nearly all  died the natural death of a feeble inferiority.--_Argus_ (Brooklyn, N.  Y.)           *       *       *       *       *    THE GREAT JOURNAL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE.--There is a place in the  periodical literature of America which is occupied by only one journal;  namely, the well-known SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.    It is almost indispensable to a well-balanced intelligence, that a  certain proportion of its reading should be devoted to the industrial  arts and sciences, those natural manifestations of the high mental  development of the age. Every number of the journal has sixteen imperial  pages, embellished with engravings, as illustrations, which are gems of  art in themselves. It is most ably edited, and its usefulness is not  impaired by technical terms nor dry details.--_Milwaukee Sentinel._           *       *       *       *       *    THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.--This paper is the oldest in its peculiar  province in the United States, and was, for many years, the only one.  More recently others have arisen, and are following in its footsteps;  but the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN still maintains its position as the best  American journal of the inventive arts. Its Patent Office department  alone is invaluable to inventors, while its editorial articles,  illustrations, etc., give not only information, but a constant stimulus  to the productive faculty.--_Mobile Register_.           *       *       *       *       *    Among the papers which we could not very well do without is the  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, issued from the well-known office of Munn & Co., 37  Park Row, New York. Carefully edited, nicely printed, well illustrated,  it is not only a complete record of the progress of useful inventions,  but a trustworthy guide to many of the scientific topics that enlist  attention at the present day. No one can be a reader of this most  valuable journal, without being kept well informed as to current matters  of scientific discovery.--_Congregationalist_ (Boston).           *       *       *       *       *    THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.--In another column we publish the prospectus of  this great paper, and would direct our readers to it.

As much has been said of late about the mode of preserving eggs, it may  not be uninteresting to say a few words about the Chinese methods, as  related by a French chemist, M. Paul Champion, who has lately visited  that country, and published a very interesting book on the ancient and  modern industries of that curious people. A very common method is to  place the eggs in a mixture of clay and water; the clay hardens around  the eggs, and is said to preserve them good for a considerable time. But  another and much more elaborate method is also commonly practiced. An  infusion of three pounds of tea is made in boiling water, and to this  are added three pounds of quicklime (or seven pounds when the operation  is performed in winter), nine pounds of sea-salt, and seven pounds of  ashes of burnt oak finely powdered. This is all well mixed together  into a smooth paste by means of a wooden spatula, and then each egg is  covered with it by hand, gloves being worn to prevent the corrosive  action of the lime on the hands. When the eggs are all covered with the  mixture, they are rolled in a mass of straw ashes, and then placed in  baskets with balls of rice--boiled, we presume--to keep the eggs from  touching each other. About 100 to 150 eggs are placed in one basket. In  about three months the whole becomes hardened into a crust, and then the  eggs are sent to market; the retail price of such eggs is generally less  than a penny each. These eggs are highly esteemed in China, and always  served in good houses; but they have undergone a strange transformation,  which certainly would not recommend them to English palates; the yolk  has assumed a decidedly green tinge, and the white is set. When broken,  they emit that unpleasant sulphurous smell which would certainly cause  their instant banishment from our breakfast-tables. However, the Chinese  are admitted, even by Frenchmen, to be great _gourmets_; and we can  only say, therefore, that in questions of eating there is certainly no  disputing about tastes.           *       *       *       *       *          STEAM BOILER INSPECTION.      Mr. Alfred Guthrie, U.S. Inspector, informs us that the following  resolution was recently adopted by the Board of Supervising Inspectors:    Resolved, That a special committee be appointed, to whom shall be  referred the subject-matter of steam boiler explosions, who shall be  requested to take up the subject in all its varied complications, and  present the result of their inquiries, with their opinions of the real  causes of such explosions, accompanied by such information as may be  of practical benefit and general interest, to be reported at the next  annual meeting of the board for its consideration.    Mr. Guthrie, whose address will be at Washington, D.C. until January 10,  desires to receive suggestions from practical engineers upon the subject  of boiler explosions.           *       *       *       *       *          EDITORIAL SUMMARY.      Darkness of complexion has been attributed to the sun's power from  the age of Solomon to this day. \"Look not upon me because I am black,  because the sun hath looked upon me.\" And there cannot be a doubt that,  to a certain degree, the opinion is well founded--the invisible rays in  the solar beams, which change vegetable color, and have been employed  with such remarkable effect on the daguerreotype, act upon every  substance on which they fall, producing mysterious and wonderful changes  in their molecular state, man not excepted.           *       *       *       *       *    The three companies under whose protection Chinese are brought into  California, keep an accurate account of the condition and employment  of the persons they import. From these books it appears that 138,000  Chinese have been brought into California. Of these, 10,426 have died,  57,323 have returned to China, and about 91,000 still remain on the  Pacific coast. But only 41,000 live in California. Of these 41,000,  9,300 are women, children, old and decrepit, or criminals confined in  the jails. The California authorities have at length decided to admit  Chinese testimony in the courts.           *       *       *       *       *    One of our subscribers residing in Maine has read our article \"How to  Spend the Winter Evenings,\" and writes to us that up in his section they  have no trouble on that score. As soon as the day's work is over the  inhabitants commence the job of trying to get their rooms warm, and as  soon as a comfortable temperature is reached it is time to go to bed.           *      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8997"],[0,"Ritchie's Fabulae Faciles: A First Latin Reader (#15)"],[1,"rocks followed him as he moved.  By his playing he even prevailed upon Pluto to give back his dead wife  Eurydice.    Théseum, a mythical hero, whose exploits resemble and rival those of  Hercules. The most famous of them was the killing of the Minotaur.  Theseus was the national hero of Athens.    Castorem, the famous tamer of horses and brother of Pollux, the boxer.  Read Macaulay's _Lays of Ancient Rome, The Battle of the Lake Regillus_.    10. quós, the subject of esse. Its antecedent is eós, line 11. The  relative frequently precedes in Latin, but the antecedent must be  translated first.    16. Argonautae. Notice the composition of this word.    24. déicerentur, part of the result clause.    26. arbitrátí. See the note on 25, 27.    égredí. See the note on 22, 18.    27. púgnátum est. See the note on 20 4.    36. 5. Postrídié éius diéí, 'the next day,' more literally 'on the day  following that day.' This idea may be expressed by _postrídié_ alone, and  the fuller expression is simply more formal.    9. in ancorís, 'at anchor.'    10. habérent. See the note on 34, 6.    11. ex Argonautís. See the note on 33, 6.    13. Quí, 'he.' See the note on _quibus_, 20, 1.    dum quaerit, 'while looking for.' The present indicative with _dum_ is  often to be translated by a present participle.    15. vídissent. We say 'saw,' but Latin makes it plain that the seeing  (and falling in love) came before the attempt to persuade.    eí. Keep a list of all intransitive verbs which are used with the dative.    16. negáret. This verb is commonly used instead of _dícó_ when a negative  statement follows; when thus used, it should be translated by 'say' with  the appropriate negative, here 'said that he would not.'    37. 1. praebuisset, subjunctive in a subordinate clause of indirect  discourse.    2. supplicí. See the note on 7, 8.    6. accubuerat. The Romans reclined at table, supporting themselves on the  left arm and taking the food with the right hand. They naturally  represented others as eating in the same way.    appositum, 'that had been placed before him.' See the note on  _exanimátum_, 14, 4.    7. Quó ... morerétur, 'and so it came to pass that Phineus was nearly  dying of starvation,' literally 'that not much was wanting but that  Phineus would die.' Ut ... abesset is a clause of result, the subject of  factum est; quin ... morerétur is a form of subordinate clause with  subjunctive verb used after certain negative expressions; famé is  ablative of cause. Notice that _famés_ has a fifth-declension ablative,  but is otherwise of the third declension.    9. Rés male sé habébat, 'the situation was desperate.' What is the  literal meaning?    12. opíniónem virtútis, 'reputation for bravery.'    13. quín ferrent. Negative expressions of doubt are regularly followed by  _quín_ and the subjunctive.    16. quantó in perículó. See the note on 11, 25.    suae rés, 'his affairs.' See the note on _rés_, 13, 8.    17. repperissent. Phineus used the future perfect indicative.    22. nihil, used adverbially.    23. áera. See the note on 4, 11.    27. Hóc factó, 'when this had been accomplished.' See the note on 34, 4.  The ablative absolute is often used instead of a subordinate clause of  time, cause, condition, or the like.    38. 1. referret. See the note on 6, 16.    3. eó cónsilió. See the note on 28, 1.    4. né quis, 'that no one.' 'Negative clauses of purpose and negative  clauses of result may be distinguished by the negative: _né, né quís_,  etc., for purpose; _ut nón, ut némó_, etc., for result.    parvó interválló, 'a short distance apart,' ablative absolute. See the  note on 34, 1.    5. in medium spatium, 'between them.'    7. quid faciendum esset, 'what was to be done.' The gerundive is used  with _sum_ to denote necessary action. This is called the passive  periphrastic conjugation.    8. sublátís ... solvit, 'weighed anchor and put to sea.' What is the  literal translation? The ablative absolute is often best translated by a  coördinate verb, and this requires a change of voice, for the lack of a  perfect active participle in Latin is the reason for the use of the  ablative absolute in such cases. If there were a perfect active  participle, it would stand in the nominative, modifying the subject, as  we have found the perfect participle of deponent verbs doing.    11. réctá ... spatium, 'straight between them.'    12. caudá tantum ámissá, 'having lost only its tail-feathers.' Notice  that we change the voice, as in line 8, and that the use of the ablative  absolute is resorted to here for the same reason as in that passage. Make  sure at this point that you know three ways in which the ablative  absolute may be translated, as in this passage, as in line 8, and as  suggested in the note on 37, 27.    14. concurrerent, 'could rush together.' See the note on _possent_, 27,  20.    intellegentés, equivalent to _cum intellegerent_.    17. dís, the usual form of the dative and ablative plural of _deus_, as  _dí_ of the nominative plural.    quórum, equivalent to _cum eórum_. A relative clause of cause, like a  _cum_-clause of cause, has its verb in the subjunctive.    27. negábat. See the note on 36, 16.    39. 1. tráditúrum. In infinitives formed with participles _esse_ is often  omitted,    prius. See the note on 27, 25.    3. Prímum. See the note on 12, 16.    4. iungendí erant. See the note on 38, 7.    8. reí bene gerendae, 'of accomplishing his mission.' What is the literal  meaning?    10. rem aegré ferébat, 'she was greatly distressed.' What is the literal  meaning?    12. Quae ... essent. See the note on 29, 23.    13. medicínae, objective genitive.    14. Mediá nocte. See the note on 9, 5.    ínsciente patre, 'without the knowledge of her father,' ablative  absolute.    15. vénit. See the note on 3, 13.    17. quod ... cónfírmáret, a relative clause of purpose.    19. essent, subjunctive in informal indirect discourse, or by attraction  to oblineret.    20. hominibus. See the note on 34, 24.    21. mágnitúdine et víribus, ablative of specification.    40. 2. nihil valére, 'prevailed not.'    5. quá in ré. See the note on 11, 25.    6. cónfécerit. See the note on 19, 22.    8. quós. See the note on _quíbus_, 20, 1.    9. autem. See the note on 5, 8.    10. essent, subjunctive by attraction.    11. quódam, 'some.'    16. gígnerentur, 'should be born.' With dum, 'until,' the subjunctive is  used of action anticipated, as with _antequam_ (see the note on  _possent_, 27, 20).    19. omnibus agrí partibus. See the note on 18, 6.    20. mírum in modum = _míró modó_.    25. nesció cúr, 'for some reason.' See the note on 33, 14.    28. núlló negótió, 'with no trouble,' 'without difficulty.'    41. 3. quín tulisset. See the note on 37, 13.    15. quam prímum, 'as soon as possible.' See the note on 23, 2.    16. ávectúrum. See the note on _tráditúrum_, 39, 1.    17. Postrídié éius diéí. See the note on 36, 5.    19. locó. The antecedent is frequently thus repeated in the relative  clause.    21. quí ... essent, 'to guard the ship.' See the note on 13, 16.    22. ipse. See the note on 21, 19.    27. quídam. This word may sometimes be rendered by the indefinite  article.    28. démónstrávimus. See the note on _nárrávimus_, 14, 17.    42. 5. dormit. See the note on _fugit_, 4, 25.    12. aliquí. Learn from the vocabulary the difference between _aliquís_  and _aliquí_.    mátúrandum sibi, 'they ought to hasten,' more literally 'haste ought to  be made by them'; mátúrandum (_esse_) is the impersonal passive, and sibi  the so-called dative of the agent. With the gerundive the person who has  the thing to do is regularly expressed in the dative.    16. mírátí. See the note on 25, 27.    20. dís. See the note on 38, 17.    21. événisset. See the note on _accépissent_, 26, 21.    23. vigiliá. The Romans divided the day from sunrise to sunset into  twelve hours (_hórae_), the night from sunset to sunrise into four  watches (_vigiliae_).    24. neque enim. See the note on 7, 12.    25. inimícó animó, ablative of description.    43. 2. hóc dolóre, 'this anger,' _i.e_. 'anger at this.'    Návem longam, 'war-galley,' 'man-of-war.' The adjective contrasts the  shape of the man-of-war with that of the merchantman.    4. fugientís, used as a noun, 'the fugitives.'    6. quá, ablative of means.    7. quá, 'as,' but in the same construction as eádem celeritáte.    8. Quo ... caperentur. See the note on 37, 7.    9. neque ... posset, 'for the distance between them was not greater than  a javelin could be thrown.' What is the literal translation? The clause  quó ... posset denotes result; the distance was not _so great that_ a  javelin could not be thrown from one ship to the other.    11. vídisset. See the note on 36, 15.    15. fugiéns, 'when she fled.' See the note on _fessus_, 23, 15.    18. fílí. See the note on 7, 8.    19. Neque ... fefellit, 'and Medea was not mistaken.' What is the literal  meaning?    20. ubi prímum, 'as soon as,' literally 'when first.'    24. prius, not to be rendered until quam is reached. The two words  together mean 'before,' more literally 'earlier than,' 'sooner than,'  They are sometimes written together (_priusquam_).    25. nihil ... esse, 'that it would be of no advantage to him.'    44. 5. pollicitus erat. Verbs of promising do not usually take in Latin  the simple present infinitive, as in English, but the construction of  indirect discourse.    10. mihi. The dative of reference is often used in Latin where we should  use a possessive in English. Translate here as if the word were _meus_,  modifying diés.    11. Liceat mihi, 'permit me,' literally 'let it be permitted to me.'  Commands and entreaties in the third person are regularly expressed in  the subjunctive.    dum vívam, 'so long as I live.' The verb with _dum_ 'so long as' is not  restricted to the present, as with _dum_ 'while,' but any tense of the  indicative may be used. We have here the future indicative, or the  present"]]]
