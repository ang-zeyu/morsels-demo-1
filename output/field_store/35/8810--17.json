Dolph reflected, next morning, that these things had been  ordered to bring together the two branches of the family and disclose the  whereabouts of the treasure that it should inherit. So full was he of  this idea that he went back to New Amsterdam by the first schooner, to  the surprise of the Heer and the regret of his daughter.    After the truant had been received with execrations by the doctor and  with delight by his mother, who believed that spooks had run off with  him, and with astonishment, as a hero of romance, by the public, he made  for the haunted premises at the first opportunity and began to angle at  the disused well. Presently he found his hook entangled in something at  the bottom, and on lifting slowly he discovered that he had secured a  fine silver porringer, with lid held down by twisted wire. It was the  work of a moment to wrench off the lid, when he found the vessel to be  filled with golden pieces. His fishing that day was attended with such  luck as never fell to an angler before, for there were other pieces of  plate down there, all engraved with the Spiegel arms and all containing  treasure.    By encouraging the most dreadful stories about the spot, in order to keep  the people wide away from it, he accomplished the removal of his prizes  bit by bit from their place of concealment to his home. His unaccounted  absence in Albany and his dealings with the dead had prepared his  neighbors for any change in himself or his condition, and now that he  always had a bottle of schnapps for the men and a pot of tea for the  women, and was good to his mother, they said that they had always known  that when he changed it would be for the better,--at which his old  detractors lifted their eyebrows significantly--and when asked to dinner  by him they always accepted.    Moreover, they made merry when the day came round for his wedding with  the little maid of Albany. They likewise elected him a member of the  corporation, to which he bequeathed some of the Spiegel plate and often  helped the other city fathers to empty the big punch-bowl. Indeed, it was  at one of these corporation feasts that he died of apoplexy. He was  buried with honors in the yard of the Dutch church in Garden Street.          THE KNELL AT THE WEDDING    A young New Yorker had laid such siege to the heart of a certain  belle--this was back in the Knickerbocker days when people married for  love--that everybody said the banns were as good as published; but  everybody did not know, for one fine morning my lady went to church with  another gentleman--not her father, though old enough to be--and when the  two came out they were man and wife. The elderly man was rich. After the  first paroxysm of rage and disappointment had passed, the lover withdrew  from the world and devoted himself to study; nor when he learned that she  had become a widow, with comfortable belongings derived from the estate  of the late lamented, did he renew acquaintance with her, and he smiled  bitterly when he heard of her second marriage to a young adventurer who  led her a wretched life, but atoned for his sins, in a measure, by dying  soon enough afterward to leave a part of her fortune unspent.    In the lapse of time the doubly widowed returned to New York, where she  met again the lover of her youth. Mr. Ellenwood had acquired the reserve  of a scholar, and had often puzzled his friends with his eccentricities;  but after a few meetings with the object of his young affection he came  out of his glooms, and with respectful formality laid again at her feet  the heart she had trampled on forty years before. Though both of them  were well on in life, the news of their engagement made little of a  sensation. The widow was still fair; the wooer was quiet, refined, and  courtly, and the union of their fortunes would assure a competence for  the years that might be left to them. The church of St. Paul, on  Broadway, was appointed for the wedding, and it was a whim of the groom  that his bride should meet him there. At the appointed hour a company of  the curious had assembled in the edifice; a rattle of wheels was heard,  and a bevy of bridesmaids and friends in hoop, patch, velvet, silk,  powder, swords, and buckles walked down the aisle; but just as the bride  had come within the door, out of the sunlight that streamed so  brilliantly on the mounded turf and tombstones in the churchyard, the  bell in the steeple gave a single boom.    The bride walked to the altar, and as she took her place before it  another clang resounded from the belfry. The bridegroom was not there.  Again and again the brazen throat and iron tongue sent out a doleful  knell, and faces grew pale and anxious, for the meaning of it could not  be guessed. With eyes fixed on the marble tomb of her first husband, the  woman tremblingly awaited the solution of the mystery, until the door was  darkened by something that made her catch her breath--a funeral. The  organ began a solemn dirge as a black-cloaked cortege came through the  aisle, and it was with amazement that the bride discovered it to be  formed of her oldest friends,--bent, withered; paired, man and woman, as  in mockery--while behind, with white face, gleaming eyes, disordered  hair, and halting step, came the bridegroom, in his shroud.    \"Come,\" he said,--\"let us be married. The coffins are ready. Then, home  to the tomb.\"    \"Cruel!\" murmured the woman.    \"Now, Heaven judge which of us has been cruel. Forty years ago you took  away my faith, destroyed my hopes, and gave to others your youth and  beauty. Our lives have nearly run their course, so I am come to wed you  as with funeral rites.\" Then, in a softer manner, he took her hand, and  said, \"All is forgiven. If we cannot live together we will at least be  wedded in death. Time is almost at its end. We will marry for eternity.  Come.\" And tenderly embracing her, he led her forward. Hard as was the  ordeal, confusing, frightening, humiliating, the bride came through it a  better woman.    \"It is true,\" she said, \"I have been vain and worldly, but now, in my  age, the truest love I ever knew has come back to me. It is a holy love.  I will cherish it forever.\" Their eyes met, and they saw each other  through tears. Solemnly the clergyman read the marriage service, and when  it was concluded the low threnody that had come from the organ in key  with the measured clang of the bell, merged into a nobler motive, until  at last the funeral measures were lost in a burst of exultant harmony.  Sobs of pent feeling and sighs of relief were heard as the bridal party  moved away, and when the newmade wife and husband reached the portal the  bell was silent and the sun was shining.          ROISTERING DIRCK VAN DARA    In the days when most of New York stood below Grand Street, a roistering  fellow used to make the rounds of the taverns nightly, accompanied by a  friend named Rooney. This brave drinker was Dirck Van Dara, one of the  last of those swag-bellied topers that made merry with such solemnity  before the English seized their unoffending town. It chanced that Dirck  and his chum were out later than usual one night, and by eleven o'clock,  when all good people were abed, a drizzle set in that drove the watch to  sleep in doorways and left Broadway tenantless. As the two choice spirits  reeled out of a hostelry near Wall Street and saw the lights go out in  the tap-room windows they started up town to their homes in Leonard  Street, but hardly had they come abreast of old St. Paul's when a strange  thing stayed them: crying was heard in the churchyard and a  phosphorescent light shone among the tombs. Rooney was sober in a moment,  but not so Dirck Van Dara, who shouted, \"Here is sport, friend Rooney.  Let's climb the wall. If the dead are for a dance, we will take partners  and show them how pigeons' wings are cut nowadays.\"    \"No,\" exclaimed the other; \"those must perish who go among the dead when  they come out of their graves. I've heard that if you get into their  clutches, you must stay in purgatory for a hundred years, and no priest  can pray you out.\"    \"Bah! old wives' tales! Come on!\" And pulling his friend with him, they  were over the fence. \"Hello! what have we here?\" As he spoke a haggard  thing arose from behind a tombstone, a witchlike creature, with rags  falling about her wasted form and hair that almost hid her face. The  twain were set a-sneezing by the fumes of sulphur, and Rooney swore  afterwards that there were little things at the end of the yard with  grinning faces and lights on the ends of their tails. Old Hollands are  heady. Dirck began to chaff the beldam on her dilapidation, but she  stopped his talk by dipping something from a caldron behind her and  flinging it over both of her visitors. Whatever it was, it burned  outrageously, and with a yell of pain they leaped the wall more briskly  than they had jumped it the other way, and were soon in full flight. They  had not gone far when the clock struck twelve.    \"Arrah! there's a crowd of them coming after,\" panted Rooney. \"Ave Mary!  I've heard that if you die with witch broth being thrown over you, you're  done for in the next world, as well as this. Let us get to Father  Donagan's. Wow!\"    As he made this exclamation the fugitives found their way opposed by a  woman, who looked at them with immodest eyes and said, \"Dirck Van Dara,  your sire, in wig and bob, turned us Cyprians out of New York, after  ducking us in the Collect. But we forgive him, and to prove it we ask you  to our festival.\"    At the stroke of midnight the street before the church had swarmed with a  motley throng, that now came onward, waving torches that sparkled like  stars. They formed a ring about Dirck and began to dance, and he, nothing  loth, seized the nymph who had addressed him and joined in the revel. Not  a soul was out or awake except themselves, and no words were said as the  dance went"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6622"],[0,"Legends That Every Child Should Know; a Selection of the Great Legends of All (#15)"],[1," was next asked whence he came. He replied that he was  a native of Ephesus, 'if this be Ephesus.'    \"'Send for your relations--your parents, if they live here,' ordered the  governor.    \"'They live here certainly,' replied the youth; and he mentioned their  names. No such names were known in the town. Then the governor  exclaimed, 'How dare you say that this money belonged to your parents  when it dates back three hundred and seventy-seven years, and is as old  as the beginning of the reign of Decius, and it is utterly unlike our  modern coinage? Do you think to impose on the old men and sages of  Ephesus? Believe me, I shall make you suffer the severities of the law  till you show where you made the discovery.'    \"'I implore you,' cried Malchus, 'in the name of God, answer me a few  questions, and then I will answer yours. Where is the Emperor Decius  gone to?'    \"The bishop answered,'My son, there is no emperor of that name; he who  was thus called died long ago.'    \"Malchus replied, 'All I hear perplexes me more and more. Follow me, and  I will show you my comrades, fled with me into a cave of Mount Celion,  only yesterday, to escape the cruelty of Decius. I will lead you to  them.'    \"The bishop turned to the governor. 'The hand of God is here,' he said.  Then they followed, and a great crowd after them. And Malchus entered  first into the cavern to his companions, and the bishop after him. And  there they saw the martyrs seated in the cave, with their faces fresh  and blooming as roses; so all fell down and glorified God. The bishop  and the governor sent notice to Theodosius, and he hurried to Ephesus.  All the inhabitants met him and conducted him to the cavern. As soon as  the saints beheld the Emperor, their faces shone like the sun, and the  Emperor gave thanks unto God, and embraced them, and said, 'I see you,  as though I saw the Saviour restoring Lazarus.' Maximian replied,  'Believe us! for the faith's sake, God has resuscitated us before the  great resurrection day, in order that you may believe firmly in the  resurrection of the dead. For as the child is in its mother's womb  living and not suffering, so have we lived without suffering, fast  asleep.' And having thus spoken, they bowed their heads, and their souls  returned to their Maker. The Emperor, rising, bent over them and  embraced them weeping. He gave them orders for golden reliquaries to be  made, but that night they appeared to him in a dream, and said that  hitherto they had slept in the earth, and that in the earth they desired  to sleep on till God should raise them again.\"          CHAPTER VII    GUY OF WARWICK      Of all the nobles of Britain none was so strong as Rohand, Earl of  Warwick, Rockingham, and Oxford. He made just laws, and made them to be  obeyed; nor king nor baron in the land could buy his favour with fine  words or gold, or shield the wrong-doer from his punishment. Passing  fair was Felice, his daughter, like some stately marble shaft of perfect  mould; haughty was she as the great gerfalcon which spurns the earth and  towers up into the noon to look the burning sun in the face. Wise  masters, hoar with learning, came out from Toulouse to teach her the  seven arts and sciences, until there was not her like for wisdom  anywhere.    Earl Rohand had a favourite page, named Guy, son of his just and upright  steward, Segard of Wallingford; a brave and fearless youth, of strong  and well-knit frame, whom Heraud of Ardenne, his tutor, taught betimes  to just with lance and sword, and how to hunt with hawk and hound by  wood and river side.    It was the feast of Pentecost, when by old custom every maiden chose her  love and every knight his leman. Guy, clad in a new silken dress, being  made cup-bearer at the banquet table, saw for the first time the  beautiful Felice, as, kneeling, he offered the golden ewer and basin and  demask napkin to wash her finger-tips before the banquet. Thenceforward  he became so love-stricken with her beauty that he heard not the music  of the glee-men, saw neither games nor tourneys, but dured in a dream,  like one crazed, all through the fourteen days festival. Knights and  fair dames praised his handsome figure and well grown sinewy limbs; he  heeded not--but once Felice gave him a courteous word as he offered her  the wine-cup; he blushed and stammered and spilled the wine, and was  rebuked for awkwardness.    The feast being over, Guy went away to his chamber, and there fell into  a great love-sickness. Hopeless it seemed for a vassal to love one so  far above him as his sovereign's daughter; so he gave himself up to  despair, and his disease grew so sore that the most skilful leeches of  Earl Rohand's court were unable to cure his complaint. In vain they let  him of blood or gave him salve or potion. \"There is no medicine of any  avail,\" the leeches said. Guy murmured, \"Felice: if one might find and  bring Felice to me, I yet might live.\" \"Felice?\" the leeches said among  themselves, and shook their heads, \"It is not in the herbal. Felice?  Felix? No, there is no plant of that name.\"    \"No herb is Felice,\" sighing answered Guy, \"but a flower--the fairest  flower that grows.\"    \"He is light-headed,\" they said. \"The flower Felice? He seeks perchance  the flower of happiness, growing in the garden of the blessed, away in  Paradise. He is surely near his end.\"    \"It is truly Paradise where Felice is,\" Guy answered,    \"You hear? You see,\" the leeches whispered one to another. \"Come, let us  go; for we can be of no more good.\"    Night came, and being left alone Guy thought to rise up from his bed and  drag himself into the presence of his mistress, there to die at her  feet. So weak was he become, he scarce could stand, but fainted many  times upon the way.    Now Felice had heard many whisperings how Guy was dying for love of her,  since her handmaidens had compassion on the youth, and sought to turn  her heart toward him; but Felice was in no mind to have a page for a  lover. Howbeit on this very night she had a dream, wherein being  straitly enjoined to entreat the youth with kindness as the only way to  save a life which would hereafter be of great service to the world, she  arose and came to a bower in the garden where Guy lay swooning on the  floor. Felice would not stoop to help him, but her maids having restored  him to his senses, Guy fell at her feet and poured out all his love  before her. Never a word answered Felice, but stood calmly regarding him  with haughty coldness. Then said one of her maids, \"O lady! were I the  richest king's daughter in the land, I could not turn away from love so  strong and true.\" Felice rebuked her, saying, \"Could not? Silly child,  see that your soft heart do not prove your shame.\" So with a tingling  cheek the maid withdrew abashed. Then said Felice to Guy, \"Why kneel  there weeping like a girl? Get up, and show if there is the making of a  man in you. Hear what I have to say. The swan mates not with the  swallow, and I will never wed beneath me. Prove that your love is not  presumption. Show yourself my peer. For I could love a brave and valiant  knight before whose spear men bowed as to a king, nor would I ask his  parentage, prouder far to know that my children took their nobleness  from a self-made nobleman. But a weeping, love-sick page! No! Go, fight  and battle--show me something that you do that I can love. Meantime I  look for such a lover, and I care not if his name be Guy the page.\"    Then Guy took heart and said, \"Lady, I ask no better boon than to have  you for witness of what love for you can do.\"    Felice answered, \"Deeds, not words. Be strong and valiant. I will watch  and I will wait.\"    Then Guy took leave of his mistress and in the course of a few days  regained his health, to the surprise of all the court, but more  especially of the leeches who had given him over for dead, and coming to  Earl Rohand, entreated him to make him a knight. To this Earl Rohand  having agreed, Guy was knighted at the next feast of Holy Trinity with a  dubbing worthy a king's son; and they brought him rich armour, and a  good sword and spear and shield, and a noble steed with costly  trappings, together with rich silken cloaks and mantles fur-trimmed, and  of great price. Then bidding farewell to Segard his father, Sir Guy left  Warwick with Heraud his tutor, and Sir Thorold and Sir Urry for company,  and having reached the nearest seaport, set sail for Normandy in search  of adventures wherein to prove his valour.    They came to Rouen, and whilst they tarried at an inn a tournament was  proclaimed in honour of the fair Blancheflor, daughter to Regnier,  Emperor of Germany, and the prize was the hand of the Princess, a white  horse, two white hounds, and a white falcon. So Sir Guy and his  companions rode into the lists, where was a great company of proven  knights and champions. Three days they tourneyed, but none could  withstand Sir Guy's strong arm. He overthrew Otho Duke of Pavia, Sir  Garie the Emperor's son, Regnier Duke of Sessoyne, the Duke of Lowayne,  and many more, till not a man was left who dared encounter him; and  being master of the field, he was adjudged the prize. The horse and  hounds and falcon he sent by two messengers to Felice in England as  trophies of his valour. Then he knelt before the beautiful Princess  Blancheflor and said, \"Lady, I battle in honour of my mistress, the  peerless Felice, and am her servant,\" whereat the Emperor and his  daughter, admiring his constancy, loaded him with rich presents and  allowed him to depart.    Sir Guy then travelled through Spain, Lombardy, and Almayne, into far  lands; and wheresoever a tournament was held, there he went and justed,  coming out victor from them all; till the fame of his exploits spread  over Christendom. So a year passed, and he returned to England  unconquered, and renowned as the most valiant knight of his time. A  while he sojourned in London"]]]
