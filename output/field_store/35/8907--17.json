I want the fastest car  going, and you seem to have it.\"    \"I hadn't thought of manufacturing them for sale,\" said the young  inventor. \"If I do, I'll let you know.\"    \"I wish you would. My! I had no idea you could beat me, but you  did--fair and square.\"    There was some more talk, and then Mr. Layton started on, after  exacting from Tom a further promise to let him know if any electrics  were to be made for sale.    \"You certainly have a wonderful car,\" complimented Ned, as he and his  chum took a short cut to Shopton.    \"Well, I'm not quite satisfied with it,\" declared Tom.    \"Why not?\"    \"Well, I've set a hundred miles an hour as my limit. I didn't make but  eighty to-day. I've got to have more speed if I go up against the crowd  that will race for the touring club's prize.\"    \"Can you make a hundred miles?\"    \"I think so. I've got to change my gears, though, and use heavier  fuses. I was afraid every second that one of the fuses would melt, and  leave me stranded. But they stood pretty well. Of course, when the car,  geared as it is now, has been run a little longer it will go faster,  but it won't come up to a hundred miles an hour. That's what I want,  and that's what I'm going to get,\" and the lad looked very determined.    Ned was taken to the bank, and, as Tom turned his machine around, to go  home, he saw, standing on the steps of the new bank, which was almost  across the street from the old one, Andy Foger, and the bully's father.  The red-haired lad laughed at Tom's rough looking car, and said  something to his parent, but Mr. Foger did not notice Tom. Not that  this caused our hero any uneasiness, however.    But, as he swung away from the bank, he saw, coming up the street a  figure that instantly attracted his attention. It was that of Mr. Berg,  and Tom at once recalled the night he had pursued the submarine agent,  and torn loose his watch charm. Mr. Berg was evidently going to enter  the new bank, for, at the sight of the former agent, Mr. Foger  descended the steps, and went to meet him.    Tom, however, had decided upon a plan of action. He steered his machine  in toward the curb, ran up the steel wind-shield, and called:    \"Mr. Berg!\"    \"Eh? What's that?\" asked the agent, in some surprise. Then, as he  caught sight of Tom, and recognized him, he added: \"I'm very busy now,  my young friend. You'll have to excuse me.\"    \"I won't detain you a moment,\" went on Tom, casually. \"I have something  of yours that I wish to return to you.\"    \"Something of mine?\" Mr. Berg was evidently puzzled. He approached the  electric car, in spite of the fact that Mr. Foger was calling him.  \"Something of mine? What is it?\"    \"This!\" exclaimed Tom suddenly, extending the compass watch charm,  which he always carried with him of late.    \"That! Where did you get that. I lost it--\"    Mr. Berg paused in some confusion.    \"I grabbed it off your watch chain the night you were hiding in our  shrubbery, and tripped me into the brook,\" answered the lad, looking  the man squarely in the eye.    \"Hiding? Tripped you? Grabbed that off my chain--\" stammered Mr. Berg.  He had taken the charm up in his fingers, but now he quickly dropped it  back into Tom's hand. \"I guess you're mistaken,\" he added quickly.  \"That's not mine. I never had one--I--er--that's not mine--at  least--Oh, you'll have to excuse me, young man, I'm in a hurry, and I  have an important engagement!\" and with that Mr. Berg wheeled off, and  joined Mr. Foger, who stood on the sidewalk, waiting for him.    \"I thought sure it was yours,\" said Tom, easily. \"Perhaps Mr. Foger  will keep it in one of the safety-deposit boxes of his bank, until the  owner claims it,\" and he looked at the banker.    \"What's that?\" asked Andy's father.    \"This watch charm which I grabbed off Mr. Berg's chain the night he was  sneaking around our house, and crossed the electric wires,\" went on the  lad.    \"Don't listen to him. He doesn't know what he is saying!\" exclaimed the  former submarine boat agent. \"It's not my charm.  He's crazy!\"    \"Oh, am I?\" thought Tom, with a grim look on his face. \"Well, we'll see  about that, Mr. Berg,\" and, putting the charm back in his pocket, Tom  swung his machine toward home, while the agent and the banker entered  the new institution.    \"So they're getting chummy,\" mused Tom. \"Andy and Berg were friends  when Andy shut me up in the submarine tank, and now Berg comes here to  do business, and Foger and his associates are trying to put the old  bank out of business. I wonder if there's any connection there? I must  keep my eyes open. Berg is an unscrupulous man, and so is Andy's  father, to say nothing of the red-haired bully himself. He had nerve to  deny that was his charm. Well, maybe I'll catch him some day.\"    Tom spent a busy week making new adjustments to his electric car,  changing the gear and providing for heavier fuses. He was planning for  another trip on the road, as the time for the great race was drawing  near, and he wanted the mechanism to be in perfect shape.    One evening, as he was preparing for a short night trip to Mansburg,  where he had promised to call for Miss Nestor, Tom left his machine  standing in the road in front of the house, while he went back to get a  robe, as it threatened to be chilly.    As he came back to enter the car, he saw some one standing near it.    \"Is that you, Ned?\" he called. \"Come, take a spin.\"    Hardly had he spoken than there sounded from the machine a whirr that  told of the current being turned on.    \"Don't do that!\" cried Tom, knowing at once that it could not be Ned,  who never meddled with the machinery.    A blinding flash and a loud report followed, and Tom saw some one leap  from his car, and try to run away. But the figure stumbled, and, a  moment later the young inventor was upon him, grappling with him.    \"Here! Let me go!\" cried a voice, and Tom uttered an exclamation of  surprise.    \"Andy Foger!\" he cried. \"I've caught you! You tried to damage my car!\"    \"Yes, and I'm hurt, too!\" whined Andy. \"My father will sue you for  damages if I die.\"    \"No danger of that; you're too mean,\" murmured Tom, as he maintained a  tight grip on the bully.    \"You let me go!\" demanded Andy, squirming to get away.    \"Wait until I see what damage you've done,\" retorted the young  inventor. \"The worst, though, would be the blowing out of a fuse, for I  had the gear disconnected. You wait a minute now. Maybe it's you who'll  have to pay damages.\"    \"You let me go!\" fairly screamed Andy, and he aimed a blow at Tom. It  caught our hero on the chest and Tom's fighting blood was up in an  instant. He drew back his left hand, and delivered a blow that landed  fairly on Andy's right eye. The bully staggered and went down in the  dust.    \"There!\" cried Tom, righteously angry. \"That will teach you not to try  to damage my car, and then hit me into the bargain! Now clear out,  before I give you some more!\"    Whining and blubbering Andy arose to his feet.    \"You just wait. I'll get square with you for this,\" he threatened.    \"You can accept part of that as pay for what you did in the tar and  feathering game,\" added Tom. Then, as Andy moved in front of one of the  electric side lamps on the car, Tom uttered a whistle of surprise. For  both of Andy's eyes were bruised and swollen, though Tom had only hit  him once.    \"Look at me!\" cried the bully, more squint-eyed than ever.  \"Look at  me! You hit me in one eye, and that explosion hit me in the other! My  father will sue you for this.\"    As he hurried off down the road Tom understood. Andy coming along, had  seen Tom's car standing there, and, thinking to do some mischief, had  climbed in, and turned on the power. Perhaps he hoped it would run into  the roadside ditch and be smashed. But as the gear was out, turning on  the electric current had a different effect. As the bully pulled the  handle over too quickly, throwing almost the entire force of the  battery into the wires at once, the load was too heavy for them. A  safety fuse blew out, causing the flare and the explosion, and a piece  of the soft lead-like metal had hit the red-haired lad in the eye.  Tom's fist had completed the work on the other optic, and for several  days thereafter Andy Foger remained in seclusion. When he did go out  there were many embarrassing questions put to him, as to when he had  had the fight. Andy didn't care to answer. As for Tom, it did not take  long to put a new fuse in his car, and he greatly enjoyed his ride with  Miss Nestor that night.          CHAPTER XVI    TROUBLE AT THE BANK      Coming in rather late from his trip to Mansburg, and thinking of some  things he and Miss Nestor had talked about, Tom was rather surprised,  on reaching the house, to see a light in his father's particular room,  where the aged inventor did his reading and his planning of new devices.    \"Dad's up rather late,\" said Tom to himself. \"I wonder if he's studying  over some new machine.\"    The lad ran his auto into the temporary garage he had built for it, and  connected the wires of a burglar alarm he had arranged, to give warning  in case any of his enemies should seek to damage the car.    Tom encountered Garret Jackson, the aged inventor who was going his  rounds, seeing that everything was all right about the various shops.    \"Anybody with my father, Garret?\" asked the lad. \"I see he's still up.\"    \"Yes,\" was the rather unexpected reply. \"Mr. Damon is with him.  They've been in your father's room all the evening--ever since you went  away in the car.\"    \"Anything the matter?\" inquired the young inventor, a bit anxious, as  he thought of the Happy Harry gang.    \"Well, I don't know,\" and the engineer seemed puzzled. \"They called me  in once to know if everything was all right outside, and to inquire if  you were back. I saw, then, that they were busy figuring over  something, but I didn't take much notice. Only I heard Mr. Damon say:  'There's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/953"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel; Or, The Hidden City of the Andes (#15)"],[1,"two.\"    \"I shall be very glad to have you,\" the bald-headed scientist remarked.    Tom's second blast was even more successful than the first, and enough  of the hard rock was loosed and pulverized to give the Indian laborers  ten days' work in removing it from the tunnel.    Then, as the services of the young inventor would not be needed for a  week or more, he decided to go on a little trip with Professor Bumper.    \"I'll come too,\" said Mr. Damon. \"One of the sub-contractors whose men  are gathering the cinchona bark for our firm has his headquarters in  the region where you are going, and I can go over there and see why he  isn't up to the mark.\"    Accordingly, preparations having been made to spend a week in camp in  the forests of the Andes, Tom and his party set off one morning.  Professor Bumper's Indian helpers would do the hard work, and, of  course, Koku, who went wherever Tom went, would be on hand in case some  feat of strength were needed.    It was a blind search, this hunt for a lost city, and as much luck  might be expected going in one direction as in another; so the party  had no fixed point toward which to travel. Only Mr. Damon stipulated  that he wanted to reach a certain village, and they planned to include  that on their route.    Tom Swift took his electric rifle with him, and with it he was able to  bring down a couple of deer which formed a welcome addition to the camp  fare.    The rifle was a source of great wonder to the Peruvians.  They were  familiar with ordinary firearms, and some of them possessed  old-fashioned guns. But Tom's electric weapon, which made not a sound,  but killed with the swiftness of light, was awesome to them. The  interpreter accompanying Professor Bumper confided privately to Tom  that the other Indians regarded the young inventor as a devil who  could, if he wished, slay by the mere winking of an eye.    Mr. Damon located the quinine-gathering force he was anxious to see,  and, through the interpreter, told the chief that more bark must be  brought in to keep up to the terms of the contract.    But something seemed to be the matter. The Indian chief was indifferent  to the interpreted demands of Mr. Damon, and that gentleman, though he  blessed any number of animate and inanimate objects, seemed to make no  impression.    \"No got men to gather bark, him say,\" translated the interpreter.    \"Hasn't got any men!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Why, look at all the lazy  beggars around the village.\"    This was true enough, for there were any number of able-bodied Indians  lolling in the shade.    \"Him say him no got,\" repeated the translator, doggedly.    At that moment screams arose back of one the grass huts, and a child  ran out into the open, followed by a savage dog which was snapping at  the little one's bare legs.    \"Bless my rat trap!\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"A mad dog!\"    Shouts and cries arose from among the Indians. Women screamed, and  those who had children gathered them up in their arms to run to  shelter. The men threw all sorts of missiles at the infuriated animal,  but seemed afraid to approach it to knock it over with a club, or to go  to the relief of the frightened child which was now only a few feet  ahead of the animal, running in a circle.    \"Me git him!\" cried Koku, jumping forward.    \"No,  Wait!\" exclaimed Tom Swift. \"You can kill the dog all right,  Koku,\" he said, \"but a scratch from his tooth might be fatal. I'll fix  him!\"    Snatching his electric rifle from the Indian bearer who carried it, Tom  took quick aim. There was no flash, no report and no puff of smoke, but  the dog suddenly crumpled up in a heap, and, with a dying yelp, rolled  to one side.  The child was saved.    The little one, aware that something had happened, turned and saw the  stretched out form of its enemy. Then, sobbing and crying, it ran  toward its mother who had just heard the news.    While the mothers gathered about the child, and while the older boys  and girls made a ring at a respectful distance from the dog, there was  activity noticed among the men of the village. They began hurrying out  along the forest paths.    \"Where are they going?\" asked Tom. \"Is there some trouble?  Was that a  sacred dog, and did I get in bad by killing it?\"    The interpreter and the native chief conversed rapidly for a moment and  then the former, turning to Tom, said:    \"Men go git cinchona bark now. Plenty get for him,\" and he pointed to  Mr. Damon. \"They no like stay in village. T'ink yo' got lightning in  yo' pocket,\" and he pointed to the electric rifle.    \"Oh, I see!\" laughed Tom. \"They think I'm a sort of wizard. Well, so I  am. Tell them if they don't get lots of quinine bark I'll have to stay  here until all the mad dogs are shot.\"    The interpreter translated, and when the chief had ceased replying, Tom  and the others were told:    \"Plenty bark git. Plenty much. Yo' go away with yo' lightning. All  right now.\"    \"Well, it's a good thing I keeled over that dog,\" Tom said. \"It was the  best object lesson I could give them.\"    And from then on there was no more trouble in this district about  getting a supply of the medicinal bark.    A week passed and Professor Bumper was no nearer finding the lost city  than he had been at first. Reluctantly, he returned to the tunnel camp  to get more provisions.    \"And then I'll start out again,\" he said.    \"We'll go with you some other time,\" promised Tom. \"But now I expect  I'll have to get another blast ready.\"    He found the debris brought down by the second one all removed, and in  a few days, preparations for exploding more of the powder were under  way.    Many holes had been drilled in the face of the cliff of hard rock, and  the charges tamped in. Electric wires connected them, and they were run  out to the tunnel mouth where the switch was located.    This was done late one afternoon, and it was planned to set off the  blast at the close of the working day, to allow all night for the fumes  to be blown away by the current of air in the tunnel.    \"Get the men out, Tim,\" said Tom, when all was ready.    \"All right, sor,\" was the answer, and the Irish foreman went back  toward the far end of the bore to tell the last shift of laborers to  come out so the blast could be set off.    But in a little while Tim came running back with a queer look on his  face.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Tom. \"Why didn't you bring the men with you?\"    \"Because, sor, they're not there!\"    \"Not in the tunnel? Why, they were working there a little while ago,  when I made the last connection!\"    \"I know they were, but they've disappeared.\"    \"Disappeared?\"    \"Yis sir. There's no way out except at this end an' you didn't see thim  come out: did you?\"    \"Then they've disappeared! That's all there is to it! Bad goin's on,  thot's what it is, sor! Bad!\" and Tim shook his head mournfully.          Chapter XV    Frightened Indians      \"There must be some mistake,\" said Tom, wondering if the Irish foreman  were given to joking. Yet he did not seem that kind of man.    \"Mistake? How can there be a mistake, sor? I wint in there to tell th'  black imps t' come out, but they're not there to tell!\"    \"What's the trouble?\" asked Job Titus, coming out of the office near  the tunnel mouth. \"What's wrong, Tom?\"    \"Why, I sent Tim in to tell the men to come out, as I was going to set  off a blast, but he says the men aren't in there. And I'm sure the last  shift hasn't come out.\"    By this time Koku, Mr. Damon and Walter Titus had come up to find out  what the trouble was.    \"The min have disappeared--that's all there is to it!\" Tim said.    \"Perhaps they have missed their way--the lights may have gone out, and  they might have wandered into some abandoned cutting,\" suggested Tom.    \"There aren't any abandoned cuttin's,\" declared Tim. \"It's a straight  bore, not a shaft of any kind. I've looked everywhere, and th' min  aren't there I tell ye!\"    \"Are the lights going?\" asked Job. \"You might have missed them in the  dark, Tim.\"    \"The lights are going all right, Mr. Titus,\" said the young man in  charge of the electrical arrangements. \"The dynamo hasn't been stopped  to-day.\"    \"Come on, we'll have a look,\" proposed Walter Titus.  \"There must be  some mistake. Hold back the blast, Tom.\"    \"All right,\" and the young inventor disconnected the electrical  detonating switch. \"I'll come along and have a look too,\" he added.  \"Don't let anybody meddle with the wires, Jack,\" he said to the young  Englishman who was in charge of the dynamo.    Into the dimly-lit tunnel advanced the party of investigators, with Tim  Sullivan in the lead.    \"Not a man could I find!\" he said, murmuring to himself.  \"Not a man!  An' I mind th' time in Oireland whin th' little people made vanish a  whole village like this, jist bekase ould Mike Maguire uprooted a bed  of shamrocks.\"    \"That's enough of your superstitions, Tim,\" warned Job Titus. \"If some  of the other Indians hear you go on this way they'll desert as they did  once before.\"    \"Did they do that?\" asked Tom.    \"Yes, we had trouble that way when we first began the work. The place  here was a howling wilderness then, and there were lots of pumas around.    \"A puma is a small sized lion, you know, not specially dangerous unless  cornered. Well, some of the men had their families here with them, and  a couple of children disappeared. The story got started that there was  a big puma--the king of them all--carrying off the little ones, and my  brother and I awoke one morning to find every laborer missing. They  departed bag and baggage. Afraid of the pumas.\"    \"What did you do?\"    \"Well, we organized ourselves and our white helpers into a hunting  party and killed a lot of the beasts. There wasn't any big one though.\"    \"And what had become of the children?\"    \"They weren't eaten at all. They had wandered off into the woods, and  some natives found them and took care of them.  Eventually, they got"]]]
