[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8190"],[0,"A Wodehouse Miscellany: Articles & Stories (#15)"],[1,"e. Mrs. Craye has been dead  some years. Then came the smash. It happened through the old man. Most  people, if you ask them, will tell you that he ought to be in  Bloomingdale; and I'm not sure they're not right. At any rate, one  morning he came down to breakfast, lifted the first cover on the  sideboard, said in a sort of despairing way, \"Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Curse  all eggs!\" and walked out of the room. Nobody thought much of it till  about an hour afterward, when they found that he had packed a grip,  left the house, and caught the train to New York. Next day they got a  letter from him, saying that he was off to Europe, never to return,  and that all communications were to be addressed to his lawyers. And  from that day on none of them had seen him. He wrote occasionally,  generally from Paris; and that was all.    Well, directly news of this got about, down swooped a series of aunts  to grab the helm. They didn't stay long. Florence had them out, one  after the other, in no time. If any lingering doubt remained in their  minds, don't you know, as to who was going to be boss at home, it  wasn't her fault. Since then she has run the show.    I went to Madison Avenue. It was one of the aunts' houses. There was  no sign of the aunt when I called--she had probably climbed a tree and  pulled it up after her--but Florence was there.    She is a tall woman with what, I believe, is called \"a presence.\" Her  eyes are bright and black, and have a way of getting right inside you,  don't you know, and running up and down your spine. She has a deep  voice. She is about ten years older than Duggie's brother Edwin, who  is six years older than Duggie.    \"Good afternoon,\" she said. \"Sit down.\"    I poured myself into a chair.    \"Reginald,\" she said, \"what is this I hear about Douglas?\"    I said I didn't know.    \"He says that you introduced him.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"To this woman--this Mrs. Darrell.\"    \"Mrs. Darrell?\"    My memory's pretty rocky, and the name conveyed nothing to me.    She pulled out a letter.    \"Yes,\" she said, \"Mrs. Dorothy Darrell.\"    \"Great Scott! Dorothea!\"    Her eyes resumed their spine drill.    \"Who is she?\"    \"Only a palmist.\"    \"Only a palmist!\" Her voice absolutely boomed. \"Well, my brother  Douglas is engaged to be married to her.\"    \"Many happy returns of the day,\" I said.    I don't know why I said it. It wasn't what I meant to say. I'm not  sure I meant to say anything.    She glared at me. By this time I was pure jelly. I simply flowed about  the chair.    \"You are facetious, Reginald,\" she said.    \"No, no, no,\" I shouted. \"It slipped out. I wouldn't be facetious for  worlds.\"    \"I am glad. It is no laughing matter. Have you any suggestions?\"    \"Suggestions?\"    \"You don't imagine it can be allowed to go on? The engagement must be  broken, of course. But how?\"    \"Why don't you tell him he mustn't?\"    \"I shall naturally express my strong disapproval, but it may not be  effective. When out of the reach of my personal influence, my wretched  brother is self-willed to a degree.\"    I saw what she meant. Good old Duggie wasn't going to have those eyes  patrolling his spine if he knew it. He meant to keep away and conduct  this business by letter. There was going to be no personal interview  with sister, if he had to dodge about America like a snipe.    We sat for a long time without speaking. Then I became rather subtle.  I had a brain-wave and saw my way to making things right for Dug and  at the same time squaring myself with Florence. After all, I thought,  the old boy couldn't keep away from home for the rest of his life. He  would have to go there sooner or later. And my scheme made it pleasant  and easy for him.    \"I'll tell you what I should do if I were you,\" I said. \"I'm not sure  I didn't read some book or see some play somewhere or other where they  tried it on, and it worked all right. Fellow got engaged to a girl,  and the family didn't like it, but, instead of kicking, they pretended  to be tickled to pieces, and had the fellow and the girl down to visit  them. And then, after the fellow had seen the girl with the home  circle as a background, don't you know, he came to the conclusion that  it wouldn't do, and broke off the engagement.\"    It seemed to strike her.    \"I hardly expected so sensible a suggestion from you, Reginald,\" she  said. \"It is a very good plan. It shows that you really have a  definite substratum of intelligence; and it is all the more deplorable  that you should idle your way through the world as you do, when you  might be performing some really useful work.\"    That was Florence all over. Even when she patted you on the head, she  had to do it with her knuckles.    \"I will invite them down next week,\" she went on. \"You had better  come, too.\"    \"It's awfully kind of you, but the fact is----\"    \"Next Wednesday. Take the three-forty-seven.\"    I met Duggie next day. He was looking happy, but puzzled, like a man  who has found a dime on the street and is wondering if there's a  string tied to it. I congratulated him on his engagement.    \"Reggie,\" he said, \"a queer thing has happened. I feel as if I'd  trodden on the last step when it wasn't there. I've just had a letter  from my sister Florence asking me to bring Dorothy home on Wednesday.  Florence doesn't seem to object to the idea of the engagement at all;  and I'd expected that I'd have to call out the police reserves when  she heard of it. I believe there's a catch somewhere.\"    I tapped him on the breastbone.    \"There is, Dug,\" I said, \"and I'll tell you what it is. I saw her  yesterday, and I can put you next to the game. She thinks that if you  see Mrs. Darrell mingling with the home circle, you'll see flaws in  her which you don't see when you don't see her mingling with the home  circle, don't you see? Do you see now?\"    He laughed--heroically, don't you know.    \"I'm afraid she'll be disappointed. Love like mine is not dependent on  environment.\"    Which wasn't bad, I thought, if it was his own.    I said good-by to him, and toddled along rather pleased with myself.  It seemed to me that I had handled his affairs in a pretty masterly  manner for a chap who's supposed to be one of the biggest chumps in  New York.    Well, of course, the thing was an absolute fliver, as I ought to have  guessed it would be. Whatever could have induced me to think that a  fellow like poor old Dug stood a dog's chance against a determined  female like his sister Florence, I can't imagine. It was like  expecting a rabbit to put up a show with a python. From the very start  there was only one possible end to the thing. To a woman like  Florence, who had trained herself as tough as whalebone by years of  scrapping with her father and occasional by-battles with aunts, it was  as easy as killing rats with a stick.    I was sorry for Mrs. Darrell. She was a really good sort and, as a  matter of fact, just the kind of wife who would have done old Duggie a  bit of good. And on her own ground I shouldn't wonder if she might not  have made a fight for it. But now she hadn't a chance. Poor old Duggie  was just like so much putty in Florence's hands when he couldn't get  away from her. You could see the sawdust trickling out of Love's Young  Dream in a steady flow.    I took Mrs. Darrell for a walk one afternoon, to see if I couldn't  cheer her up a bit, but it wasn't much good. She hardly spoke a word  till we were on our way home. Then she said with a sort of jerk: \"I'm  going back to New York tomorrow, Mr. Pepper.\"    I suppose I ought to have pretended to be surprised, but I couldn't  work it.    \"I'm afraid you've had a bad time,\" I said. \"I'm very sorry.\"    She laughed.    \"Thank you,\" she said. \"It's nice of you to be sympathetic instead of  tactful. You're rather a dear, Mr. Pepper.\"    I hadn't any remarks to make. I whacked at a nettle with my stick.    \"I shall break off my engagement after dinner, so that Douglas can  have a good night's rest. I'm afraid he has been brooding on the  future a good deal. It will be a great relief to him.\"    \"Oh, no,\" I said.    \"Oh, yes. I know exactly how he feels. He thought he could carry me  off, but he finds he overestimated his powers. He has remembered that  he is a Craye. I imagine that the fact has been pointed out to him.\"    \"If you ask my opinion,\" I said--I was feeling pretty sore about  it--\"that woman Florence is an absolute cat.\"    \"My dear Mr. Pepper, I wouldn't have dreamed of asking your opinion on  such a delicate subject. But I'm glad to have it. Thank you very much.  Do I strike you as a vindictive woman, Mr. Pepper?\"    \"I don't think you do,\" I said.    \"By nature I don't think I am. But I'm feeling a little vindictive  just at present.\"    She stopped suddenly.    \"I don't know why I'm boring you like this, Mr. Pepper,\" she said.  \"For goodness' sake let's be cheerful. Say something bright.\"    I was going to take a whirl at it, but she started in to talk, and  talked all the rest of the way. She seemed to have cheered up a whole  lot.    She left next day. I gather she fired Duggie as per schedule, for the  old boy looked distinctly brighter, and Florence wore an off-duty  expression and was quite decently civil. Mrs. Darrell bore up all  right. She avoided Duggie, of course, and put in most of the time  talking to Edwin. He evidently appreciated it, for I had never seen  him look so nearly happy before.    I went back to New York directly afterward, and I hadn't been there  much more than a week when a most remarkably queer thing happened.  Turning in at Hammerstein's for half an hour one evening, whom should  I meet but brother Edwin, quite fairly festive, with a fat cigar in  his mouth. \"Hello, Reggie,\" he said.    \"What are you doing here?\" I said.    \"I had to come up to New York to look up a life of Hilary de Craye at  the library. I believe Mister Man was a sort of ancestor.\"    \"This isn't the library.\"    \"I was beginning to guess as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8220"],[0,"Remarks (#15)"],[1,"good cider. This cider when put into a  brandy flask that has not been drained too dry, and allowed to stand until  Christmas, puts a great deal of expression into a country dance. I have  tried it once myself, so that I could write it up for your valuable paper.    People who were present at that dance, and who saw me frolic around there  like a thing of life, say that it was well worth the price of admission.  Stone fence always flies right to the weakest spot. So it goes right to my  head and makes me eccentric.    The violin virtuoso who \"fiddled,\" \"called off\" and acted as justice of  the peace that evening, said that I threw aside all reserve and entered  with great zest into the dance, and seemed to enjoy it much better than  those who danced in the same set with me. Since that, the very sight of a  common crab apple makes my head reel. I learned afterward that this cider  had frozen, so that the alleged cider which we drank that night was the  clear, old-fashioned brandy, which of course would not freeze.    We should strive, however, to lead such lives that we will never be  ashamed to look a cider barrel square in the bung.    [Illustration]          Literary Freaks.    People who write for a livelihood get some queer propositions from those  who have crude ideas about the operation of the literary machine. There is  a prevailing idea among those who have never dabbled in literature very  much, that the divine afflatus works a good deal like a corn sheller. This  is erroneous.    To put a bushel of words into the hopper and have them come out a poem or  a sermon, is a more complicated process than it would seem to the casual  observer.    I can hardly be called literary, though I admit that my tastes lie in that  direction, and yet I have had some singular experiences in that line. For  instance, last year I received flattering overtures from three young men  who wanted me to write speeches for them to deliver on the Fourth of July.  They could do it themselves, but hadn't the time. If I would write the  speeches they would be willing to revise them. They seemed to think it  would be a good idea to write the speeches a little longer than necessary  and then the poorer parts of the effort could be cut out. Various prices  were set on these efforts, from a dollar to \"the kindest regards.\" People  who have squeezed through one of our adult winters in this latitude,  subsisting on kind regards, will please communicate with the writer,  stating how they like it.    One gentleman, who was in the confectionery business, wanted a lot of  \"humorous notices wrote for to put into conversation candy.\" It was a big  temptation to write something that would be in every lady's mouth, but I  refrained. Writing gum drop epitaphs may properly belong to the domain of  literature, but I doubt it. Surely I do not want to be haughty and above  my business, but it seems to me that this is irrelevant.    Another man wanted me to write a \"piece for his boy to speak,\" and if I  would do so, I could come to his house some Saturday night and stay over  Sunday. He said that the boy was \"a perfect little case to carry on and  folks didn't know whether he would develop into a condemb fool or a  youmerist.\" So he wanted a piece of one of them tomfoolery kind for the  little cuss to speak the last day of school.    [Illustration: HIS MOTTO.]    A coal dealer who had risen to affluence by selling coal to the poor by  apothecaries' weight, wrote to ask me for a design to be used as a family  crest and a motto to emblazon on his arms. I told him I had run out of  crests, but that \"weight for the wagon, we'll all take a ride,\" would be a  good motto; or he might use the following: \"The fuel and his money are  soon parted.\" He might emblazon this on his arms, or tattoo it on any  other part of his system where he thought it would be becoming to his  complexion. I never heard from him again, and I do not know whether he was  offended or not.    Two young men in Massachusetts wrote me a letter in which they said they  \"had a good thing on mother.\" They wanted it written up in a facetious  vein. They said that their father had been on the coast a few weeks  before, engaged in the eeling industry. Being a good man, but partially  full, he had mingled himself in the flowing tide and got drowned. Finally,  after several days' search, the neighbors came in sadly and told the old  lady thai they had found all that was mortal of James, and there were two  eels in the remains. They asked for further instructions as to deceased.  The old lady swabbed out her weeping eyes, braced herself against the sink  and told the men to \"bring in the eels and set him again.\"    The boys thought that if this could be properly written up, \"it would be a  mighty good joke on mother.\" I was greatly shocked when I received this  letter. It seemed to me heartless for young men to speak lightly of their  widowed mother's great woe. I wrote them how I felt about it, and rebuked  them severely for treating their mother's grief so lightly. Also for  trying to impose upon me with an old chestnut.          A Father's Advice to His Son.    My dear Henry.--Your pensive favor of the 20th inst., asking for more  means with which to persecute your studies, and also a young man from  Ohio, is at hand and carefully noted.    I would not be ashamed to have you show the foregoing sentence to your  teacher, if it could be worked, in a quiet way, so as not to look  egotistic on my part. I think myself that it is pretty fair for a man that  never had any advantages.    But, Henry, why will you insist on fighting the young man from Ohio? It is  not only rude and wrong, but you invariably get licked. There's where the  enormity of the thing comes in.    It was this young man from Ohio, named Williams, that you hazed last year,  or at least that's what I gether from a letter sent me by your warden. He  maintains that you started in to mix Mr. Williams up with the campus in  some way, and that in some way Mr. Williams resented it and got his fangs  tangled up in the bridge of your nose.    You never wrote this to me or to your mother, but I know how busy you are  with your studies, and I hope you won't ever neglect your books just to  write to us.    Your warden, or whoever he is, said that Mr. Williams also hung a  hand-painted marine view over your eye and put an extra eyelid on one of  your ears.    I wish that, if you get time, you would write us about it, because, if  there's anything I can do for you in the arnica line, I would be pleased  to do so.    The president also says that in the scuffle you and Mr. Williams swapped  belts as follows, to-wit: That Williams snatched off the belt of your  little Norfolk jacket, and then gave you one in the eye.    From this I gether that the old prez, as you faseshusly call him, is an  youmorist. He is not a very good penman, however; though, so far, his  words have all been spelled correct.    I would hate to see you permanently injured, Henry, but I hope that when  you try to tramp on the toes of a good boy simply because you are a  seanyour and he is a fresh, as you frequently state, that he will arise  and rip your little pleated jacket up the back and make your spinal colyum  look like a corderoy bridge in the spring tra la. (This is from a Japan  show I was to last week.)    Why should a seanyour in a colledge tromp onto the young chaps that come  in there to learn? Have you forgot how I fatted up the old cow and beefed  her so that you could go and monkey with youclid and algebray? Have you  forgot how the other boys pulled you through a mill pond and made you  tobogin down hill in a salt barrel with brads in it? Do you remember how  your mother went down there to nuss you for two weeks and I stayed to  home, and done my own work and the housework too and cooked my own vittles  for the whole two weeks?    And now, Henry, you call yourself a seanyour, and therefore, because you  are simply older in crime, you want to muss up Mr. Williams's features so  that his mother will have to come over and nuss him. I am glad that your  little pleated coat is ripped up the back, Henry, under the circumstances,  and I am also glad that you are wearing the belt--over your off eye. If  there's anything I can do to add to the hilarity of the occasion, please  let me know and I will tend to it.    The lop-horned heifer is a parent once more, and I am trying in my poor,  weak way to learn her wayward offspring how to drink out of a patent pail  without pushing your old father over into the hay-mow. He is a cute little  quadruped, with a wild desire to have fun at my expense. He loves to  swaller a part of my coat-tail Sunday morning, when I am dressed up, and  then return it to me in a moist condition. He seems to know that when I  address the sabbath school the children will see the joke and enjoy it.    Your mother is about the same, trying in her meek way to adjust herself to  a new set of teeth that are a size too large for her. She has one large  bunion in the roof of her mouth already, but is still resolved to hold out  faithful, and hopes these few lines will find you enjoying the same great  blessing.    You will find inclosed a dark-blue money-order for four eighty-five. It is  money that I had set aside to pay my taxes, but there is no novelty about  paying taxes. I've done that before, so it don't thrill me as it used to.    Give my congratulations to Mr. Williams. He has got the elements of  greatness to a wonderful degree. If I happened to be participating in that  colledge of yours, I would gently but firmly decline to be tromped onto.    So good-bye for this time.    Your Father.          Eccentricity in Lunch.    Over at Kasota Junction, the other day, I found a living curiosity. He was  a man of about medium height, perhaps 45 years of age, of a quiet  disposition, and not noticeable or peculiar in his general manner. He runs  the"]]]
