You may make a very plain veal pie simply of veal chops, sliced  onions, and potatoes pared and quartered. Season with pepper and  salt, and fill up the dish with water.      CALF'S HEAD DREST PLAIN    Wash the head in warm water. Then lay it in clean hot water and  let it soak awhile. This will blanch it. Take out the brains and  the black part of the eyes. Tie the head in a cloth, and put it  into a large fish-kettle, with plenty of cold water, and add some  salt to throw up the scum, which must be taken off as it rises.  Let the head boil gently about three hours.    Put eight or ten sage leaves, and as much parsley, into a small  sauce-pan with a little water, and boil them half an hour. Then  chop them fine, and set them ready on a plate. Wash the brains  well in two warm waters, and then soak them for an hour in a basin  of cold water with a little salt in it. Remove the skin and  strings, and then put the brains into a stew-pan with plenty of  cold water, and let them boil gently for a quarter of an hour,  skimming them well. Take them out, chop them, and mix them with  the sage and parsley leaves, two table-spoonfuls of melted butter,  and the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, and pepper and salt to  your taste. Then put the mixture into a sauce-pan and set it on  coals to warm.    Take up the head when it is sufficiently boiled, score it in  diamonds, brush it all over with beaten egg, and strew it with a  mixture of grated bread-crumbs, and chopped sage and parsley.  Stick a few bits of butter over it, and set it in a Dutch oven to  brown. Serve it up with the brains laid round it. Or you may send  to table the brains and the tongue in a small separate dish,  having first trimmed the tongue and cut off the roots. Have also  parsley-sauce in a boat. You may garnish with very thin small  slices of broiled ham, curled up.    If you get a calf's head with the hair on, sprinkle it all over  with pounded rosin, and dip it into boiling water. This will make  the hairs scrape off easily.      CALF'S HEAD HASHED.    Take a calf's head and a set of feet, and boil them until tender,  having first removed the brains. Then cut the flesh off the head  and feet in slices from the bone, and put both meat and bones into  a stew-pan with a bunch of sweet herbs, some sliced onions, and  pepper and salt to your taste; also a large piece of butter rolled  in flour, and a little water. After it has stewed awhile slowly  till the flavour is well extracted from the herbs and onions, take  out the meat, season it a little with cayenne pepper, and lay it  in a dish. Strain the gravy in which it was stewed, and stir into  it two glasses of madeira, and the juice and grated peel of a  lemon. Having poured some of the gravy over the meat, lay a piece  of butter on the top, set it in an oven and bake it brown.    In the mean time, having cleaned and washed the brains (skinning  them and removing the strings) parboil them in a sauce-pan, and  then make them into balls with chopped sweet herbs, grated bread-crumbs,  grated lemon-peel, nutmeg, and beaten yolk of egg. Fry  them in lard and butter mixed; and send them to table laid round  the meat (which should have the tongue placed on the top) and  garnish with sliced lemon. Warm the remaining gravy in a small  sauce-pan on hot coals, and stir into it the beaten yolk of an egg  a minute before you take it from the fire. Send it to table in a  boat.      CHITTERLINGS OR CALF'S TRIPE.    See that the chitterlings are very nice and white. Wash them, cut  them into pieces, and put them into a stew-pan with pepper and  salt to your taste, and about two quarts of water. Boil them two  hours or more. In the mean time, peel eight or ten white onions,  and throw them whole into a sauce-pan with plenty of water. Boil  them slowly till quite soft; then drain them in a cullender, and  mash them. Wipe out your sauce-pan, and put in the mashed onions  with a piece of butter, two table-spoonfuls of cream or rich milk,  some nutmeg, and a very little salt. Sprinkle in a little flour,  set the pan on hot coals (keeping it well covered) and give it one  boil up.    When the chitterlings are quite tender all through, take them up  and drain them. Place in the bottom of a dish a slice or two of  buttered toast with all the crust cut off. Lay the chitterlings on  the toast, and send them to table with the stewed onions in a  sauce-boat. When you take the chitterlings on your plate season  them with pepper and vinegar.    This, if properly prepared, is a very nice dish.      TO FRY CALF'S FEET.    Having first boiled them till tender, cut them in two, and (having  taken out the large bones) season the feet with pepper and salt,  and dredge them well with flour. Strew some chopped parsley or  sweet marjoram over them, and fry them of a light brown in lard or  butter. Serve them up with parsley-sauce.      TO FRY CALF'S LIVER.    Cut the liver into thin slices. Season it with pepper, salt,  chopped sweet herbs, and parsley. Dredge it with flour, and fry it  brown in lard or dripping. See that it is thoroughly done before  you send it to table. Serve it up with its own gravy.    Some slices of cold boiled ham fried with it will be found an  improvement.    You may dress a calf's heart in the same manner.      LARDED CALF'S LIVER.    Take a calf's liver and wash it well. Cut into long slips the fat  of some bacon or salt pork, and insert it all through the surface  of the liver by means of a larding-pin. Put the liver into a pot  with a table-spoonful of lard, a little water, and a few tomatas,  or some tomata catchup; adding one large or two small onions  minced fine, and some sweet marjoram leaves rubbed very fine. The  sweet marjoram will crumble more easily if you first dry it before  the fire on a plate.    Having put in all these ingredients, set the pot on hot coals in  the corner of the fire-place, and keep it stewing, regularly and  slowly, for four hours. Send the liver to table with the gravy  round it.      TO ROAST SWEET-BREADS.    Take four fine sweet-breads, and having trimmed them nicely,  parboil them, and then lay them in a pan of cold water till they  become cool. Afterwards dry them in a cloth. Put some butter into  a sauce-pan, set it on hot coals, and melt and skim it. When it is  quite clear, take it off. Have ready some beaten egg in one dish,  and some grated bread-crumbs in another. Skewer each sweet-bread,  and fasten them on a spit. Then glaze them all over with egg, and  sprinkle them with bread-crumbs. Spread on some of the clarified  butter, and then another coat of crumbs. Roast them before a clear  fire, at least a quarter of an hour. Have ready some nice veal  gravy flavoured with lemon-juice, and pour it round the sweet-breads  before you send them to table.      LARDED SWEET-BREADS.    Parboil three or four of the largest sweet-breads you can get.  This should be done as soon as they are brought in, as few things  spoil more rapidly if not cooked at once. When half boiled, lay  them in cold water. Prepare a force-meat of grated bread, lemon-peel,  butter, salt, pepper, and nutmeg mixed with beaten yolk of  egg. Cut open the sweet-breads and stuff them with it, fastening  them afterwards with a skewer, or tying them round with  packthread. Have ready some slips of bacon-fat, and some slips of  lemon-peel cut about the thickness of very small straws. Lard the  sweet-breads with them in alternate rows of bacon and lemon-peel,  drawing them through with a larding-needle. Do it regularly and  handsomely. Then put the sweet-breads into a Dutch oven, and bake  them brown. Serve them up with veal gravy flavoured with a glass  of Madeira, and enriched with beaten yolk of egg stirred in at the  last.      MARBLED VEAL.    Having boiled and skinned two fine smoked tongues, cut them to  pieces and pound them to a paste in a mortar, moistening them with  plenty of butter as you proceed. Have ready an equal quantity of  the lean of veal stewed and cut into very small pieces. Pound the  veal also in a mortar, adding butter to it by degrees. The tongue  and veal must be kept separate till both have been pounded. Then  fill your potting cans with lumps of the veal and tongue, pressed  down hard, and so placed, that when cut, the mixture will look  variegated or marbled. Close the cans with veal; again press it  down very hard, and finish by pouring on clarified butter. Cover  the cans closely, and keep them in a dry place. It maybe eaten at  tea or supper. Send it to table cut in slices.    You may use it for sandwiches.          MUTTON AND LAMB.      GENERAL REMARKS.    The fore-quarter of a sheep contains the neck, breast, and  shoulder; and the hind-quarter the loin and leg. The two loins  together are called the chine or saddle. The flesh of good mutton  is of a bright red, and a close grain, and the fat firm and quite  white. The meat will feel tender and springy when you squeeze it  with your fingers. The vein in the neck of the fore-quarter should  be of a fine blue.    Lamb is always roasted; generally a whole quarter at once. In  carving lamb, the first thing done is to separate the shoulder  from the breast, or the leg from the loin.    If the weather is cold enough to allow it, mutton is more tender  after being kept a few days.      TO ROAST MUTTON.    Mutton should be roasted with a quick brisk fire. Every part  should be trimmed off that cannot be eaten. Wash the meat well.  The skin should be taken off and skewered on again before the meat  is put on the spit; this will make it more juicy. Otherwise tie  paper over the fat, having soaked the twine in water to prevent  the string from burning. Put a little salt and water into the  dripping-pan, to baste the meat at first, then use its own gravy  for that purpose. A quarter of an hour before you think it will be  done, take off the skin or paper, dredge the meat very lightly  with flour, and baste it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9628"],[0,"Buried Cities: Pompeii, Olympia, Mycenae (Complete) (#15)"],[1,"over and over. I wept because  I was not a Greek. I said to myself, 'I will see Greece! I will study  Greek. I will work hard. I will make a bankful of money. Then I will  go to Greece. I will uncover Troy-city and see Priam's palace. I  will uncover Mycenae and see Agamemnon's grave.' I have come. I have  uncovered Troy. Now I am here. I will come again and bring workmen with  me. You shall see wonders.\" He walked excitedly around and around the  ruins. He told stories of the old city. He asked his wife to recite  the old tales of Homer. She half sang the beautiful Greek words. Her  husband's eyes grew wet as he listened.    This man's name was Dr. Henry Schliemann. He kept his word. He went  away but he came again in a few years. He hired men and horse-carts. He  rented houses in the little village. Myceae was a busy place again after  three thousand years. More than a hundred men were digging on the top  of this hill. They wore the fezes and kilts of the modern Greek. Little  two-wheeled horse-carts creaked about, loading and dumping.    Some of the men were working about the wall near the stone lions.    \"This is the great gate of the city,\" said Dr. Schliemann. \"Here the  king and his warriors used to march through, thousands of years ago. But  it is filled up with dirt. We must clear it out. We must get down to the  very stones they trod.\"    But it was slow work. The men found the earth full of great stone  blocks. They had to dig around them carefully, so that Dr. Schliemann  might see what they were.    \"How did so many great stones come here?\" they said among themselves.    Then Dr. Schliemann told them. He pointed to the wall above the gate.    \"Once, long, long ago,\" he said, \"the warriors of Mycenae stood up  there. Down here stood an army--the men of Argos, their enemies. The men  of Argos battered at the gate. They shot arrows at the men of Mycenae,  and the men of Mycenae shot at the Argives, and they threw down great  stones upon them. See, here is one of those broken stones, and here, and  here. After a long time the people of Mycenae had no food left in their  city. Their warriors fainted from hunger. Then the Argives beat down the  gate. They rushed into the city and drove out the people. They did not  want men ever again to live in Mycenae, so they took crowbars and tried  to tear down the wall. A few stones they knocked off. See, here, and  here, and here they are, where they fell off the wall. But these great  stones are very heavy. This one must weigh a hundred twenty tons,--more  than all the people of your village. So the Argives gave up the attempt,  and there stand the walls yet. Then the rain washed down the dirt from  the hill and covered these great stones, and now we are digging them out  again.\"    The men worked at the gateway for many weeks. At last all the dirt and  the blocks had been cleared away. The tall gateway stood open. A hole  was in the stone door-casing at top and bottom. Schliemann put his hand  into it.    \"See!\" he cried. \"Here turned the wooden hinge of the gate.\"    He pointed to another large hole on the side of the casing. \"Here the  gatekeeper thrust in the beam to hold the gate shut.\"    Just inside the gate he found the little room where the keeper had  stayed. He found also two little sentry boxes high up on the wall. Here  guards had stood and looked over the country, keeping watch against  enemies. From the gate the wall bent around the edge of the hilltop,  shutting it in. In two places had been towers for watchmen. Inside this  great wall the king's palace and a few houses had been safe. Outside,  other houses had been built. But in time of war all the people had  flocked into the fortress. The gate had been shut. The warriors had  stood on the wall to defend their city.    But while some of Dr. Schliemann's men were digging at the gateway and  the wall, others were working outside the city. They were making a great  hole, a hundred and thirteen feet square. They put the dirt into baskets  and carried it to the little carts to be hauled away. And always Dr.  Schliemann and his wife worked with them. From morning until dusk every  day they were there. It was August, and the sun was hot. The wind blew  dust into their faces and made their eyes sore, and yet they were happy.  Every day they found some little thing that excited them,--a terra cotta  goblet, a broken piece of a bone lyre, a bronze ax, the ashes of an  ancient fire.    At first Dr. Schliemann and his wife had fingered over every spadeful  of dirt. There might be something precious in it. \"Dig carefully,  carefully!\" Dr. Schliemann had said to the workmen. \"Nothing must be  broken. Nothing must be lost. I must see everything. Perhaps a bit of a  broken vase may tell a wonderful story.\"    But during this work of many weeks he had taught his workmen how to dig.  Now each man looked over every spadeful of earth himself, as he dug it  up. He took out every scrap of stone or wood or pottery or metal and  gave it to Schliemann or his wife. So the excavators had only to study  these things and to tell the men where to work. When a man struck some  new thing with his spade, he called out. Then the excavators ran to  that place and dug with their own hands. When anything was found, Dr.  Schliemann sent it to the village. There it was kept in a house under  guard. At night Dr. Schliemann drew plans of Mycenae. He read again old  Greek books about the city. As he read he studied his plans. He wrote  and wrote.    \"As soon as possible, I must tell the world about what we find,\" he said  to his wife. \"People will love my book, because they love the stories of  Homer.\"    There had been four months of hard work. A few precious things had  been uncovered,--a few of bronze and clay, a few of gold, some carved  gravestones. But were these the wonders Schliemann had promised? Was  this to be all? They had dug down more than twenty feet. A few more  days, and they would probably reach the solid rock. There could be  nothing below that. November was rainy and disagreeable. The men had to  work in the mud and wet. There was much disappointment on the hilltop.    Then one day a spade grated on gravel. Once before that had happened,  and they had found gold below. They called out to Dr. Schliemann. He and  his wife came quickly. Fire leaped into Schliemann's eyes.    \"Stop!\" he said. \"Now I will dig. Spades are too clumsy.\"    So he and his wife dropped upon their knees in the mud. They dug with  their knives. Carefully, bit by bit, they lifted the dirt. All at once  there was a glint of gold.    \"Do not touch it!\" cried Schliemann, \"we must see it all at once. What  will it be?\"    So they dug on. The men stood about watching. Every now and then they  shouted out, when some wonderful thing was uncovered, and Schliemann  would stop work and cry,    \"Did not I tell you? Is it not worth the work?\"    At last they had lifted off all the earth and gravel. There was a great  mass of golden things--golden hairpins, and bracelets, and great golden  earrings like wreaths of yellow flowers, and necklaces with pictures  of warriors embossed in the gold, and brooches in the shape of stags'  heads. There were gold covers for buttons, and every one was molded into  some beautiful design of crest or circle or flower or cuttle-fish.    And among them lay the bones of three persons. Across the forehead of  one was a diadem of gold, worked into designs of flowers. \"See!\" cried  Schliemann, \"these are queens. See their crowns, their scepters.\"    For near the hands lay golden scepters, with crystal balls.    And there were golden boxes with covers. Perhaps long ago, one of these  queens had kept her jewels in them. There was a golden drinking cup with  swimming fish on its sides. There were vases of bronze and silver and  gold. There was a pile of gold and amber beads, lying where they had  fallen when the string had rotted away from the queenly neck. And  scattered all over the bodies and under them were thin flakes of gold in  the shapes of flowers, butterflies, grasshoppers, swans, eagles, leaves.  It seemed as though a golden tree had shed its leaves into the grave.    \"Think! Think! Think!\" cried Schliemann. \"These delicate lovely things  have lain buried here for three thousand years. You have pastured your  sheep above them. Once queens wore them and walked the streets we are  uncovering.\"    The news of the find spread like wildfire over the country. Thousands of  people came to visit the buried city. It was the most wonderful treasure  that had ever been found. The king of Athens sent soldiers to guard the  place. They camped on the acropolis. Their fires blazed there at night.  Schliemann telegraphed to the king:    \"With great joy I announce to your majesty that I have discovered  the tombs which old stories say are the graves of Agamemnon and his  followers. I have found in them great treasures in the shape of ancient  things in pure gold. These treasures, alone, are enough to fill a great  museum. It will be the most wonderful collection in the world. During  the centuries to come it will draw visitors from all over the earth to  Greece. I am working for the joy of the work, not for money. So I give  this treasure, with much happiness, to Greece. May it be the corner  stone of great good fortune for her.\"    The work went on, and soon they found another grave, even more  wonderful. Here lay five people--two of them women, three of them  warriors. Golden masks covered the faces of the men. Two wore golden  breastplates. The gold clasp of the greave was still around one knee.  Near one man lay a golden crown and a sceptre, and a sword belt of gold.  There was a heap of stone arrowheads, and a pile of twenty bronze swords  and daggers. One had a picture of a lion hunt inlaid in gold. The wooden  handles of the swords and daggers were rotted away, but the gold nails  that had fastened them lay there, and the gold"]]]
