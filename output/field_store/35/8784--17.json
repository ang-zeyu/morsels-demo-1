[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#15)"],[1," We speak of whatever is given in sensation, or is of the same  nature as things given in sensation, as a _particular_; by opposition  to this, a _universal_ will be anything which may be shared by many  particulars, and has those characteristics which, as we saw, distinguish  justice and whiteness from just acts and white things.    When we examine common words, we find that, broadly speaking, proper  names stand for particulars, while other substantives, adjectives,  prepositions, and verbs stand for universals. Pronouns stand for  particulars, but are ambiguous: it is only by the context or the  circumstances that we know what particulars they stand for. The word  'now' stands for a particular, namely the present moment; but like  pronouns, it stands for an ambiguous particular, because the present is  always changing.    It will be seen that no sentence can be made up without at least one  word which denotes a universal. The nearest approach would be some such  statement as 'I like this'. But even here the word 'like' denotes  a universal, for I may like other things, and other people may like  things. Thus all truths involve universals, and all knowledge of truths  involves acquaintance with universals.    Seeing that nearly all the words to be found in the dictionary stand  for universals, it is strange that hardly anybody except students of  philosophy ever realizes that there are such entities as universals. We  do not naturally dwell upon those words in a sentence which do not stand  for particulars; and if we are forced to dwell upon a word which stands  for a universal, we naturally think of it as standing for some one of  the particulars that come under the universal. When, for example, we  hear the sentence, 'Charles I's head was cut off', we may naturally  enough think of Charles I, of Charles I's head, and of the operation  of cutting off _his_ head, which are all particulars; but we do not  naturally dwell upon what is meant by the word 'head' or the word  'cut', which is a universal: We feel such words to be incomplete and  insubstantial; they seem to demand a context before anything can be  done with them. Hence we succeed in avoiding all notice of universals as  such, until the study of philosophy forces them upon our attention.    Even among philosophers, we may say, broadly, that only those universals  which are named by adjectives or substantives have been much or often  recognized, while those named by verbs and prepositions have been  usually overlooked. This omission has had a very great effect upon  philosophy; it is hardly too much to say that most metaphysics, since  Spinoza, has been largely determined by it. The way this has occurred  is, in outline, as follows: Speaking generally, adjectives and common  nouns express qualities or properties of single things, whereas  prepositions and verbs tend to express relations between two or more  things. Thus the neglect of prepositions and verbs led to the belief  that every proposition can be regarded as attributing a property to a  single thing, rather than as expressing a relation between two or more  things. Hence it was supposed that, ultimately, there can be no such  entities as relations between things. Hence either there can be only  one thing in the universe, or, if there are many things, they cannot  possibly interact in any way, since any interaction would be a relation,  and relations are impossible.    The first of these views, advocated by Spinoza and held in our own day  by Bradley and many other philosophers, is called _monism_; the second,  advocated by Leibniz but not very common nowadays, is called _monadism_,  because each of the isolated things is called a _monad_. Both these  opposing philosophies, interesting as they are, result, in my opinion,  from an undue attention to one sort of universals, namely the sort  represented by adjectives and substantives rather than by verbs and  prepositions.    As a matter of fact, if any one were anxious to deny altogether that  there are such things as universals, we should find that we cannot  strictly prove that there are such entities as _qualities_, i.e. the  universals represented by adjectives and substantives, whereas we  can prove that there must be _relations_, i.e. the sort of universals  generally represented by verbs and prepositions. Let us take in  illustration the universal _whiteness_. If we believe that there is such  a universal, we shall say that things are white because they have the  quality of whiteness. This view, however, was strenuously denied by  Berkeley and Hume, who have been followed in this by later empiricists.  The form which their denial took was to deny that there are such things  as 'abstract ideas '. When we want to think of whiteness, they said, we  form an image of some particular white thing, and reason concerning this  particular, taking care not to deduce anything concerning it which we  cannot see to be equally true of any other white thing. As an account of  our actual mental processes, this is no doubt largely true. In geometry,  for example, when we wish to prove something about all triangles, we  draw a particular triangle and reason about it, taking care not to use  any characteristic which it does not share with other triangles. The  beginner, in order to avoid error, often finds it useful to draw several  triangles, as unlike each other as possible, in order to make sure that  his reasoning is equally applicable to all of them. But a difficulty  emerges as soon as we ask ourselves how we know that a thing is white  or a triangle. If we wish to avoid the universals _whiteness_ and  _triangularity_, we shall choose some particular patch of white or some  particular triangle, and say that anything is white or a triangle if it  has the right sort of resemblance to our chosen particular. But then the  resemblance required will have to be a universal. Since there are many  white things, the resemblance must hold between many pairs of particular  white things; and this is the characteristic of a universal. It will be  useless to say that there is a different resemblance for each pair, for  then we shall have to say that these resemblances resemble each other,  and thus at last we shall be forced to admit resemblance as a universal.  The relation of resemblance, therefore, must be a true universal. And  having been forced to admit this universal, we find that it is no longer  worth while to invent difficult and unplausible theories to avoid the  admission of such universals as whiteness and triangularity.    Berkeley and Hume failed to perceive this refutation of their rejection  of 'abstract ideas', because, like their adversaries, they only thought  of _qualities_, and altogether ignored _relations_ as universals. We  have therefore here another respect in which the rationalists appear to  have been in the right as against the empiricists, although, owing to  the neglect or denial of relations, the deductions made by rationalists  were, if anything, more apt to be mistaken than those made by  empiricists.    Having now seen that there must be such entities as universals, the next  point to be proved is that their being is not merely mental. By this is  meant that whatever being belongs to them is independent of their being  thought of or in any way apprehended by minds. We have already touched  on this subject at the end of the preceding chapter, but we must now  consider more fully what sort of being it is that belongs to universals.    Consider such a proposition as 'Edinburgh is north of London'. Here we  have a relation between two places, and it seems plain that the relation  subsists independently of our knowledge of it. When we come to know that  Edinburgh is north of London, we come to know something which has to  do only with Edinburgh and London: we do not cause the truth of the  proposition by coming to know it, on the contrary we merely apprehend a  fact which was there before we knew it. The part of the earth's surface  where Edinburgh stands would be north of the part where London stands,  even if there were no human being to know about north and south, and  even if there were no minds at all in the universe. This is, of course,  denied by many philosophers, either for Berkeley's reasons or for  Kant's. But we have already considered these reasons, and decided that  they are inadequate. We may therefore now assume it to be true that  nothing mental is presupposed in the fact that Edinburgh is north of  London. But this fact involves the relation 'north of', which is a  universal; and it would be impossible for the whole fact to involve  nothing mental if the relation 'north of', which is a constituent part  of the fact, did involve anything mental. Hence we must admit that the  relation, like the terms it relates, is not dependent upon thought, but  belongs to the independent world which thought apprehends but does not  create.    This conclusion, however, is met by the difficulty that the relation  'north of' does not seem to _exist_ in the same sense in which Edinburgh  and London exist. If we ask 'Where and when does this relation exist?'  the answer must be 'Nowhere and nowhen'. There is no place or time where  we can find the relation 'north of'. It does not exist in Edinburgh any  more than in London, for it relates the two and is neutral as between  them. Nor can we say that it exists at any particular time. Now  everything that can be apprehended by the senses or by introspection  exists at some particular time. Hence the relation 'north of' is  radically different from such things. It is neither in space nor in  time, neither material nor mental; yet it is something.    It is largely the very peculiar kind of being that belongs to universals  which has led many people to suppose that they are really mental. We  can think _of_ a universal, and our thinking then exists in a perfectly  ordinary sense, like any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],[0,"The Woman in White (#15)"],[1,"s; it's just said to be for Miss Fairlie,\" answered the lad,  holding out the letter as he spoke.    Miss Halcombe took it from him and looked at the address.    \"A strange handwriting,\" she said to herself.  \"Who can Laura's  correspondent be? Where did you get this?\" she continued, addressing  the gardener.    \"Well, miss,\" said the lad, \"I just got it from a woman.\"    \"What woman?\"    \"A woman well stricken in age.\"    \"Oh, an old woman.  Any one you knew?\"    \"I canna' tak' it on mysel' to say that she was other than a stranger  to me.\"    \"Which way did she go?\"    \"That gate,\" said the under-gardener, turning with great deliberation  towards the south, and embracing the whole of that part of England with  one comprehensive sweep of his arm.    \"Curious,\" said Miss Halcombe; \"I suppose it must be a begging-letter.  There,\" she added, handing the letter back to the lad, \"take it to the  house, and give it to one of the servants.  And now, Mr. Hartright, if  you have no objection, let us walk this way.\"    She led me across the lawn, along the same path by which I had followed  her on the day after my arrival at Limmeridge.    At the little summer-house, in which Laura Fairlie and I had first seen  each other, she stopped, and broke the silence which she had steadily  maintained while we were walking together.    \"What I have to say to you I can say here.\"    With those words she entered the summer-house, took one of the chairs  at the little round table inside, and signed to me to take the other.  I suspected what was coming when she spoke to me in the breakfast-room;  I felt certain of it now.    \"Mr. Hartright,\" she said, \"I am going to begin by making a frank  avowal to you.  I am going to say--without phrase-making, which I  detest, or paying compliments, which I heartily despise--that I have  come, in the course of your residence with us, to feel a strong  friendly regard for you.  I was predisposed in your favour when you  first told me of your conduct towards that unhappy woman whom you met  under such remarkable circumstances.  Your management of the affair  might not have been prudent, but it showed the self-control, the  delicacy, and the compassion of a man who was naturally a gentleman.  It made me expect good things from you, and you have not disappointed  my expectations.\"    She paused--but held up her hand at the same time, as a sign that she  awaited no answer from me before she proceeded.  When I entered the  summer-house, no thought was in me of the woman in white.  But now,  Miss Halcombe's own words had put the memory of my adventure back in my  mind.  It remained there throughout the interview--remained, and not  without a result.    \"As your friend,\" she proceeded, \"I am going to tell you, at once, in  my own plain, blunt, downright language, that I have discovered your  secret--without help or hint, mind, from any one else.  Mr. Hartright,  you have thoughtlessly allowed yourself to form an attachment--a  serious and devoted attachment I am afraid--to my sister Laura.  I  don't put you to the pain of confessing it in so many words, because I  see and know that you are too honest to deny it.  I don't even blame  you--I pity you for opening your heart to a hopeless affection.  You  have not attempted to take any underhand advantage--you have not spoken  to my sister in secret. You are guilty of weakness and want of  attention to your own best interests, but of nothing worse.  If you had  acted, in any single respect, less delicately and less modestly, I  should have told you to leave the house without an instant's notice, or  an instant's consultation of anybody.  As it is, I blame the misfortune  of your years and your position--I don't blame YOU.  Shake hands--I  have given you pain; I am going to give you more, but there is no help  for it--shake hands with your friend, Marian Halcombe, first.\"    The sudden kindness--the warm, high-minded, fearless sympathy which met  me on such mercifully equal terms, which appealed with such delicate  and generous abruptness straight to my heart, my honour, and my  courage, overcame me in an instant.  I tried to look at her when she  took my hand, but my eyes were dim.  I tried to thank her, but my voice  failed me.    \"Listen to me,\" she said, considerately avoiding all notice of my loss  of self-control.  \"Listen to me, and let us get it over at once.  It is  a real true relief to me that I am not obliged, in what I have now to  say, to enter into the question--the hard and cruel question as I think  it--of social inequalities. Circumstances which will try you to the  quick, spare me the ungracious necessity of paining a man who has lived  in friendly intimacy under the same roof with myself by any humiliating  reference to matters of rank and station.  You must leave Limmeridge  House, Mr. Hartright, before more harm is done.  It is my duty to say  that to you; and it would be equally my duty to say it, under precisely  the same serious necessity, if you were the representative of the  oldest and wealthiest family in England. You must leave us, not because  you are a teacher of drawing----\"    She waited a moment, turned her face full on me, and reaching across  the table, laid her hand firmly on my arm.    \"Not because you are a teacher of drawing,\" she repeated, \"but because  Laura Fairlie is engaged to be married.\"    The last word went like a bullet to my heart.  My arm lost all  sensation of the hand that grasped it.  I never moved and never spoke.  The sharp autumn breeze that scattered the dead leaves at our feet came  as cold to me, on a sudden, as if my own mad hopes were dead leaves  too, whirled away by the wind like the rest. Hopes! Betrothed, or not  betrothed, she was equally far from me. Would other men have remembered  that in my place? Not if they had loved her as I did.    The pang passed, and nothing but the dull numbing pain of it remained.  I felt Miss Halcombe's hand again, tightening its hold on my arm--I  raised my head and looked at her.  Her large black eyes were rooted on  me, watching the white change on my face, which I felt, and which she  saw.    \"Crush it!\" she said.  \"Here, where you first saw her, crush it! Don't  shrink under it like a woman.  Tear it out; trample it under foot like  a man!\"    The suppressed vehemence with which she spoke, the strength which her  will--concentrated in the look she fixed on me, and in the hold on my  arm that she had not yet relinquished--communicated to mine, steadied  me.  We both waited for a minute in silence.  At the end of that time I  had justified her generous faith in my manhood--I had, outwardly at  least, recovered my self-control.    \"Are you yourself again?\"    \"Enough myself, Miss Halcombe, to ask your pardon and hers. Enough  myself to be guided by your advice, and to prove my gratitude in that  way, if I can prove it in no other.\"    \"You have proved it already,\" she answered, \"by those words. Mr.  Hartright, concealment is at an end between us.  I cannot affect to  hide from you what my sister has unconsciously shown to me. You must  leave us for her sake, as well as for your own.  Your presence here,  your necessary intimacy with us, harmless as it has been, God knows, in  all other respects, has unsteadied her and made her wretched.  I, who  love her better than my own life--I, who have learnt to believe in that  pure, noble, innocent nature as I believe in my religion--know but too  well the secret misery of self-reproach that she has been suffering  since the first shadow of a feeling disloyal to her marriage engagement  entered her heart in spite of her.  I don't say--it would be useless to  attempt to say it after what has happened--that her engagement has ever  had a strong hold on her affections.  It is an engagement of honour,  not of love; her father sanctioned it on his deathbed, two years since;  she herself neither welcomed it nor shrank from it--she was content to  make it.  Till you came here she was in the position of hundreds of  other women, who marry men without being greatly attracted to them or  greatly repelled by them, and who learn to love them (when they don't  learn to hate!) after marriage, instead of before.  I hope more  earnestly than words can say--and you should have the self-sacrificing  courage to hope too--that the new thoughts and feelings which have  disturbed the old calmness and the old content have not taken root too  deeply to be ever removed. Your absence (if I had less belief in your  honour, and your courage, and your sense, I should not trust to them as  I am trusting now) your absence will help my efforts, and time will  help us all three.  It is something to know that my first confidence in  you was not all misplaced.  It is something to know that you will not  be less honest, less manly, less considerate towards the pupil whose  relation to yourself you have had the misfortune to forget, than  towards the stranger and the outcast whose appeal to you was not made  in vain.\"    Again the chance reference to the woman in white! Was there no  possibility of speaking of Miss Fairlie and of me without raising the  memory of Anne Catherick, and setting her between us like a fatality  that it was hopeless to avoid?    \"Tell me what apology I can make to Mr. Fairlie for breaking my  engagement,\" I said.  \"Tell me when to go after that apology is  accepted.  I promise implicit obedience to you and to your advice.\"    \"Time is every way of importance,\" she answered.  \"You heard me refer  this morning to Monday next, and to the necessity of setting the purple  room in order.  The visitor whom we expect on Monday----\"    I could not wait for her to be more explicit.  Knowing what I knew now,  the memory of Miss Fairlie's look and manner at the breakfast-table  told me that the expected visitor at Limmeridge House was her future  husband.  I tried to force it back; but something rose within me at  that moment stronger"]]]
