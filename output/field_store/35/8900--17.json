The French in 1812 had no 24-pounder frigates, for the very good  reason that they had all fallen victims to the English 18-pounder's;  but in July of that year a Danish frigate, the _Nayaden_, which  carried long 24's, was destroyed by the English ship _Dictator_, 64.    The British frigates were of several rates. The lowest rated 32,  carrying in all 40 guns, 26 long 12's on the main-deck and 14  24-pound carronades on the spar-deck--a broadside of 324 pounds.  [Footnote: In all these vessels there were generally two long 6's  or 9's substituted for the bow-chase carronades.] The 36-gun  frigates, like the _Phoebe_, carried 46 guns, 26 long 18's on the  gun-deck and 32-pound carronades above. The 38-gun frigates, like  the _Macedonian_, carried 48 or 49 guns, long 18's below and  32-pound carronades above. The 32-gun frigates, then, presented in  broadside 13 long 12's below and 7 24-pound carronades above; the  38-gun frigates, 14 long 18's below and 10 32-pound carronades  above; so that a 44-gun frigate would naturally present 15 long  24's and 12 42-pound carronades above, as the _United States_ did  at first. The rate was perfectly proper, for French, British, and  Danes already possessed 24-pounder frigates; and there was really  less disparity between the force and rate of a 44 that carried 54  guns than there was in a 38 that carried 49, or, like the  _Shannon_, 52. Nor was this all. Two of our three victories were  won by the _Constitution_, which only carried 32-pound carronades,  and once 54 and once 52 guns; and as two thirds of the work was  thus done by this vessel, I shall now compare her with the largest  British frigates. Her broadside force consisted of 15 long 24's on  the main-deck, and on the spar-deck one long 24, and in one case  10, in the other 11 32-pound carronades--a broadside of 704 or 736  pounds. [Footnote: Nominally; in reality about 7 per cent, less on  account of the short weight in the metal.] There was then in the  British navy the _Acasta_, 40, carrying in broadside 15 long 18's  and 11 32-pound carronades; when the spar-deck batteries are equal,  the addition of 90 pounds to the main-deck broadside (which is all  the superiority of the _Constitution_ over the _Acasta_) is  certainly not enough to make the distinction between a frigate and  a disguised 74. But not considering the _Acasta_, there were in the  British navy three 24-pounder frigates, the _Cornwallis_,  _Indefatigable_, and _Endymion_. We only came in contact with the  latter in 1815, when the _Constitution_ had but 52 guns. The  _Endymion_ then had an armament of 28 long 24's, 2 long 18's, and  20 32-pound carronades, making a broadside of 674 pounds, [Footnote:  According to James 664 pounds; he omits the chase guns for no  reason.] or including a shifting 24-pound carronade, of 698  pounds--just _six pounds_, or 1 per cent, less than the force of  that \"disguised line-of-battle ship\" the _Constitution_! As the  _Endymion_ only rated as a 40, and the _Constitution_ as a 44, it  was in reality the former and not the latter which was underrated.  I have taken the _Constitution_, because the British had more to  do with her than they did with our other two 44's taken together.  The latter were both of heavier metal than the _Constitution_,  carrying 42-pound carronades. In 1812 the _United States_ carried  her full 54 guns, throwing a broadside of 846 pounds; when captured,  the _President_ carried 53, having substituted a 24-pound carronade  for two of her 42's, and her broadside amounted to 828 pounds, or  16 per cent _nominal_, and, on account of the short weight of her  shot, 9 per cent, _real_ excess over the _Endymion_. If this  difference made her a line-of-battle ship, then the _Endymion_ was  doubly a line-of-battle ship compared to the _Congress_ or  _Constellation_. Moreover, the American commanders found their  42-pound carronades too heavy; as I have said the _Constitution_  only mounted 32's, and the _United States_ landed 6 of her guns.  When, in 1813, she attempted to break the blockade, she carried  but 48 guns, throwing a broadside of 720 pounds--just 3 per cent  more than the _Endymion_. [Footnote: It was on account of this  difference of 3 per cent that Captain Hardy refused to allow the  _Endymion_ to meet the _States_ (James, vi. p. 470). This was  during the course of some challenges and counter-challenges which  ended in nothing, Decatur in his turn being unwilling to have the  _Macedonian_ meet the _Statira_, unless the latter should agree  not to take on a picked crew. He was perfectly right in this; but  he ought never to have sent the challenge at all, as two ships but  an hour or two out of port would be at a frightful disadvantage  in a fight.] If our frigates were line-of-battle ships the disguise  was certainly marvellously complete, and they had a number of  companions equally disguised in the British ranks.    The 44's were thus _true frigates_, with one complete battery of  long guns and one interrupted one of carronades. That they were  better than any other frigates was highly creditable to our  ingenuity and national skill. We cannot, perhaps, lay claim to  the invention and first use of the heavy frigate, for 24-pounder  frigates were already in the service of at least three nations,  and the French 36-pound carronnade, in use on their spar-decks,  threw a heavier ball than our 42-pounder. But we had enlarged and  perfected the heavy frigate, and were the first nation that ever  used it effectively. The French _Forte_ and the Danish _Nayaden_  shared the fate of ships carrying guns of lighter calibre; and  the British 24-pounders, like the _Endymion_, had never accomplished  any thing. Hitherto there had been a strong feeling, especially  in England, that an 18-pound gun was as effective as a 24- in  arming a frigate; we made a complete revolution in this respect.  England had been building only 18-pounder vessels when she ought  to have been building 24-pounders. It was greatly to our credit  that our average frigate was superior to the average British frigate;  exactly as it was to our discredit that the _Essex_ was so  ineffectively armed. Captain Porter owed his defeat chiefly to his  ineffective guns, but also to having lost his topmast, to the  weather being unfavorable, and, still more, to the admirable  skill with which Hilyar used his superior armament. The _Java_,  _Macedonian_, and _Guerrière_ owed their defeat partly to their  lighter guns, but much more to the fact that their captains and  seamen did not display either as good seamanship or as good gunnery  as their foes. Inferiority in armament was a factor to be taken  into account in all the four cases, but it was more marked in that  of the _Essex_ than in the other three; it would have been fairer  for Porter to say that he had been captured by a line-of-battle  ship, than for the captain of the _Java_ to make that assertion.  In this last case the forces of the two ships compared almost  exactly as their rates. A 44 was matched against a 38; it was not  surprising that she should win, but it _was_ surprising that she  should win with ease and impunity. The long 24's on the  _Constitution's_ gun-deck no more made her a line-of-battle ship  than the 32-pound carronades mounted on an English frigate's  quarter-deck and forecastle made _her_ a line-of-battle ship when  opposed to a Frenchman with only 8's and 6's on his spar-deck.  When, a few years before, the English _Phoebe_ had captured the  French _Nereide_, their broadsides were respectively 407 and 258  pounds, a greater disparity than in any of our successful fights;  yet no author thought of claiming that the _Phoebe_ was any thing  but a frigate. So with the _Clyde_, throwing 425 lbs., which took  the _Vestale_, throwing but 246. The facts were that 18-pounder  frigates had captured 12-pounders, exactly as our 24-pounders in  turn captured the 18-pounders.    Shortly before Great Britain declared war on us, one of her  18-pounder frigates, the _San Florenzo_, throwing 476 lbs. in a  broadside, captured the 12-pounder French frigate _Psyché_, whose  broadside was only 246 lbs. The force of the former was thus  almost double that of the latter, yet the battle was long and  desperate, the English losing 48 and the French 124 men. This  conflict, then, reflected as much credit on the skill and seamanship  of the defeated as of the victorious side; the difference in loss  could fairly be ascribed to the difference in weight of metal.  But where, as in the famous ship-duels of 1812, the difference in  force is only a fifth, instead of a half and yet the slaughter,  instead of being as five is to two, is as six to one, then the  victory is certainly to be ascribed as much to superiority in skill  as to superiority in force. But, on the other hand, it should always  be remembered that there was a very decided superiority in force.  It is a very discreditable feature of many of our naval histories  that they utterly ignore this superiority, seeming ashamed to  confess that it existed. In reality it was something to be proud  of. It was highly to the credit of the United States that her  frigates were of better make and armament than any others; it  always speaks well for a nation's energy and capacity that any of  her implements of warfare are of superior kind. This is a perfectly  legitimate reason for pride.    It spoke well for the Prussians in 1866 that they opposed  breech-loaders to the muzzle-loaders of the Austrians; but it would  be folly to give all the credit of the victory to the breech-loaders  and none to Moltke and his lieutenants. Thus, it must remembered  that two things contributed to our victories. One was the excellent  make and armament of our ships; the other was the skilful seamanship,  excellent discipline, and superb gunnery of the men who were in  them.

'What the devil business has he to stop up so late!' muttered Sim,  passing into the workshop, and setting it down upon the forge. 'Here's  half the night gone already. There's only one good that has ever come to  me, out of this cursed old rusty mechanical trade, and that's this piece  of ironmongery, upon my soul!'    As he spoke, he drew from the right hand, or rather right leg pocket of  his smalls, a clumsy large-sized key, which he inserted cautiously in  the lock his master had secured, and softly opened the door. That done,  he replaced his piece of secret workmanship in his pocket; and leaving  the lamp burning, and closing the door carefully and without noise,  stole out into the street--as little suspected by the locksmith in his  sound deep sleep, as by Barnaby himself in his phantom-haunted dreams.        Chapter 8      Clear of the locksmith's house, Sim Tappertit laid aside his cautious  manner, and assuming in its stead that of a ruffling, swaggering, roving  blade, who would rather kill a man than otherwise, and eat him too if  needful, made the best of his way along the darkened streets.    Half pausing for an instant now and then to smite his pocket and assure  himself of the safety of his master key, he hurried on to Barbican, and  turning into one of the narrowest of the narrow streets which diverged  from that centre, slackened his pace and wiped his heated brow, as if  the termination of his walk were near at hand.    It was not a very choice spot for midnight expeditions, being in truth  one of more than questionable character, and of an appearance by no  means inviting. From the main street he had entered, itself little  better than an alley, a low-browed doorway led into a blind court, or  yard, profoundly dark, unpaved, and reeking with stagnant odours. Into  this ill-favoured pit, the locksmith's vagrant 'prentice groped his way;  and stopping at a house from whose defaced and rotten front the rude  effigy of a bottle swung to and fro like some gibbeted malefactor,  struck thrice upon an iron grating with his foot. After listening in  vain for some response to his signal, Mr Tappertit became impatient, and  struck the grating thrice again.    A further delay ensued, but it was not of long duration. The ground  seemed to open at his feet, and a ragged head appeared.    'Is that the captain?' said a voice as ragged as the head.    'Yes,' replied Mr Tappertit haughtily, descending as he spoke, 'who  should it be?'    'It's so late, we gave you up,' returned the voice, as its owner stopped  to shut and fasten the grating. 'You're late, sir.'    'Lead on,' said Mr Tappertit, with a gloomy majesty, 'and make remarks  when I require you. Forward!'    This latter word of command was perhaps somewhat theatrical and  unnecessary, inasmuch as the descent was by a very narrow, steep, and  slippery flight of steps, and any rashness or departure from the beaten  track must have ended in a yawning water-butt. But Mr Tappertit being,  like some other great commanders, favourable to strong effects, and  personal display, cried 'Forward!' again, in the hoarsest voice he could  assume; and led the way, with folded arms and knitted brows, to the  cellar down below, where there was a small copper fixed in one corner,  a chair or two, a form and table, a glimmering fire, and a truckle-bed,  covered with a ragged patchwork rug.    'Welcome, noble captain!' cried a lanky figure, rising as from a nap.    The captain nodded. Then, throwing off his outer coat, he stood composed  in all his dignity, and eyed his follower over.    'What news to-night?' he asked, when he had looked into his very soul.    'Nothing particular,' replied the other, stretching himself--and he was  so long already that it was quite alarming to see him do it--'how come  you to be so late?'    'No matter,' was all the captain deigned to say in answer. 'Is the room  prepared?'    'It is,' replied the follower.    'The comrade--is he here?'    'Yes. And a sprinkling of the others--you hear 'em?'    'Playing skittles!' said the captain moodily. 'Light-hearted revellers!'    There was no doubt respecting the particular amusement in which these  heedless spirits were indulging, for even in the close and stifling  atmosphere of the vault, the noise sounded like distant thunder. It  certainly appeared, at first sight, a singular spot to choose, for that  or any other purpose of relaxation, if the other cellars answered to  the one in which this brief colloquy took place; for the floors were of  sodden earth, the walls and roof of damp bare brick tapestried with  the tracks of snails and slugs; the air was sickening, tainted, and  offensive. It seemed, from one strong flavour which was uppermost among  the various odours of the place, that it had, at no very distant period,  been used as a storehouse for cheeses; a circumstance which, while it  accounted for the greasy moisture that hung about it, was agreeably  suggestive of rats. It was naturally damp besides, and little trees of  fungus sprung from every mouldering corner.    The proprietor of this charming retreat, and owner of the ragged head  before mentioned--for he wore an old tie-wig as bare and frowzy as a  stunted hearth-broom--had by this time joined them; and stood a little  apart, rubbing his hands, wagging his hoary bristled chin, and smiling  in silence. His eyes were closed; but had they been wide open, it would  have been easy to tell, from the attentive expression of the face he  turned towards them--pale and unwholesome as might be expected in one  of his underground existence--and from a certain anxious raising and  quivering of the lids, that he was blind.    'Even Stagg hath been asleep,' said the long comrade, nodding towards  this person.    'Sound, captain, sound!' cried the blind man; 'what does my noble  captain drink--is it brandy, rum, usquebaugh? Is it soaked gunpowder, or  blazing oil? Give it a name, heart of oak, and we'd get it for you, if  it was wine from a bishop's cellar, or melted gold from King George's  mint.'    'See,' said Mr Tappertit haughtily, 'that it's something strong, and  comes quick; and so long as you take care of that, you may bring it from  the devil's cellar, if you like.'    'Boldly said, noble captain!' rejoined the blind man. 'Spoken like the  'Prentices' Glory. Ha, ha! From the devil's cellar! A brave joke! The  captain joketh. Ha, ha, ha!'    'I'll tell you what, my fine feller,' said Mr Tappertit, eyeing the  host over as he walked to a closet, and took out a bottle and glass as  carelessly as if he had been in full possession of his sight, 'if you  make that row, you'll find that the captain's very far from joking, and  so I tell you.'    'He's got his eyes on me!' cried Stagg, stopping short on his way back,  and affecting to screen his face with the bottle. 'I feel 'em though I  can't see 'em. Take 'em off, noble captain. Remove 'em, for they pierce  like gimlets.'    Mr Tappertit smiled grimly at his comrade; and twisting out one more  look--a kind of ocular screw--under the influence of which the blind man  feigned to undergo great anguish and torture, bade him, in a softened  tone, approach, and hold his peace.    'I obey you, captain,' cried Stagg, drawing close to him and filling  out a bumper without spilling a drop, by reason that he held his little  finger at the brim of the glass, and stopped at the instant the liquor  touched it, 'drink, noble governor. Death to all masters, life to all  'prentices, and love to all fair damsels. Drink, brave general, and warm  your gallant heart!'    Mr Tappertit condescended to take the glass from his outstretched hand.  Stagg then dropped on one knee, and gently smoothed the calves of his  legs, with an air of humble admiration.    'That I had but eyes!' he cried, 'to behold my captain's symmetrical  proportions! That I had but eyes, to look upon these twin invaders of  domestic peace!'    'Get out!' said Mr Tappertit, glancing downward at his favourite limbs.  'Go along, will you, Stagg!'    'When I touch my own afterwards,' cried the host, smiting them  reproachfully, 'I hate 'em. Comparatively speaking, they've no more  shape than wooden legs, beside these models of my noble captain's.'    'Yours!' exclaimed Mr Tappertit. 'No, I should think not. Don't talk  about those precious old toothpicks in the same breath with mine; that's  rather too much. Here. Take the glass. Benjamin. Lead on. To business!'    With these words, he folded his arms again; and frowning with a sullen  majesty, passed with his companion through a little door at the upper  end of the cellar, and disappeared; leaving Stagg to his private  meditations.    The vault they entered, strewn with sawdust and dimly lighted, was  between the outer one from which they had just come, and that in which  the skittle-players were diverting themselves; as was manifested by  the increased noise and clamour of tongues, which was suddenly stopped,  however, and replaced by a dead silence, at a signal from the long  comrade. Then, this young gentleman, going to a little cupboard,  returned with a thigh-bone, which in former times must have been part  and parcel of some individual at least as long as himself, and placed  the same in the hands of Mr Tappertit; who, receiving it as a sceptre  and staff of authority, cocked his three-cornered hat fiercely on the  top of his head, and mounted a large table, whereon a chair of state,  cheerfully ornamented with a couple of skulls, was placed ready for his  reception.    He had no sooner assumed this position, than another young gentleman  appeared, bearing in his arms a huge clasped book, who made him a  profound obeisance, and delivering it to the long comrade, advanced to  the table, and turning his back upon it, stood there Atlas-wise. Then,  the long"]]]
