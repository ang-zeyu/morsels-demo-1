John was  on intimate terms with his nephew, Otho IV., Emperor of Germany and the  foe of Philip Augustus, who had supported against him Frederick II., his  rival for the empire.  They prepared in concert for a grand attack upon  the King of France, and they had won over to their coalition some of his  most important vassals, amongst others, Renaud de Dampierre, Count of  Boulogne.  Philip determined to divert their attack, whilst anticipating  it, by an unexpected enterprise--the invasion of England itself.  Circumstances seemed favorable.  King John, by his oppression and his  perfidy, had drawn upon him the hatred and contempt of his people; and  the barons of England, supported and guided by the Archbishop of  Canterbury, Stephen Langton, had commenced against him the struggle which  was to be ended some years afterwards by the forced concession of Magna  Charta, that foundation-stone of English liberties.  John, having been  embroiled for five years past with the court of Rome, affected to defy  the excommunication which the pope had hurled at him, and of which the  King of France had been asked by several prelates of the English Church  to insure the efficient working.  On the 8th of April, 1213, Philip  convoked, at Soissons, his principal vassals or allies, explained to them  the grounds of his design against the King of England, and, by a sort of  special confederation, they bound themselves, all of them, to support  him.  One of the most considerable vassals, however, the sometime regent  of France during the minority of Philip, Ferrand, Count of Flanders, did  not attend the meeting to which he had been summoned, and declared his  intention of taking no part in the war against England.  \"By all the  saints of France,\" cried Philip, \"either France shall become Flanders, or  Flanders France!\"  And, all the while pressing forward the equipment of a  large fleet collected at Calais for the invasion of England, he entered  Flanders, besieged and took several of the richest cities in the country,  Cassel, Ypres, Bruges, and Courtrai, and pitched his camp before the  walls of Ghent, \"to lower,\" as he said, \"the pride of the men of Ghent  and make them bend their necks beneath the yoke of kings.\"  But he heard  that John Lackland, after making his peace with the court of Rome through  acceptance of all the conditions and all the humiliations it had thought  proper to impose upon him, had just landed at Rochelle, and was exciting  a serious insurrection amongst the lords of Saintonge and Poitou.  At the  same time Philip's fleet, having been attacked in Calais roads by that of  John, had been half destroyed or captured; and the other half had been  forced to take shelter in the harbor of Damme, where it was strictly  blockaded.  Philip, forthwith adopting a twofold and energetic  resolution, ordered his son Philip to go and put down the insurrection of  the Poitevines on the banks of the Loire, and himself took in hand the  war in Flanders, which was of the most consequence, considering the  quality of the foe and the designs they proclaimed.  They had at their  head the Emperor Otho IV., who had already won the reputation of a brave  and able soldier; and they numbered in their ranks several of the  greatest lords, German, Flemish, and Dutch, and Hugh de Boves, the most  dreaded of those adventurers in the pay of wealthy princes who were known  at that time by the name of roadsters (routiers, mercenaries).  They  proposed, it was said, to dismember France; and a promise to that effect  had been made by the Emperor Otho to his principal chieftains assembled  in secret conference.  \"It is against Philip himself, and him alone,\" he  had said to them, \"that we must direct all our efforts; it is he who must  be slain first of all, for it is he alone who opposes us and makes  himself our foe in everything.  When he is dead, you will be able to  subdue and divide the kingdom according to our pleasure; as for thee,  Renaud, thou shalt take Peronne and all Vermandois; Hugh shall be master  of Beauvais, Salisbury of Dreux, Conrad of Mantes, together with Vexin,  and as for thee, Ferranti, thou shalt have Paris.\"    The two armies marched over the Low Countries and Flanders, seeking out  both of them the most favorable position for commencing the attack.  On  Sunday, the 27th of August, 1214, Philip had halted near the bridge of  Bouvines, not far from Lille, and was resting under an ash beside a small  chapel dedicated to St. Peter.  There came running to him a messenger,  sent by Guerin, Bishop of Senlis, his confidant in war as well as  government, and brought him word that his rear-guard, attacked by the  Emperor Otho, was not sufficient to resist him.  Philip went into the  chapel, said a short prayer, and cried as he came out, \"Haste we forward  to the rescue of our comrades!\"  Then he put on his armor, mounted his  horse, and made swiftly for the point of attack, amidst the shouts of all  those who were about him, \"To arms! to arms!\"    [Illustration: BATTLE OF BOUVINES----81]    Both armies numbered in their ranks not only all the feudal chivalry on  the two sides, but burgher-forces, those from the majority of the great  cities of Flanders being for Otho, and those from sixteen towns or  communes of France for Philip Augustus.  It was not, as we have seen, the  first time that the forces from the French rural districts had taken part  in the king's wars; Louis the Fat had often received their aid against  the tyrannical and turbulent lords of his small kingdom; but since the  reign of Louis the Fat the organization and importance of the communes  had made great progress in France; and it was not only rural communes,  but considerable cities, such as Amiens, Arras, Beauvais, Compiegne, and  Soissons, which sent to the army of Philip Augustus bodies of men in  large numbers and ready trained to arms.  Contemporary historians put the  army of Otho at one hundred thousand, and that of Philip Augustus at from  fifty to sixty thousand men; but amongst modern historians one of the  most eminent, M. Sismondi, reduces them both to some fifteen or twenty  thousand.  One would say that the reduction is as excessive as the  original estimate.  However that may be, the communal forces evidently  filled an important place in the king's army at Bouvines, and maintained  it brilliantly.  So soon as Philip had placed himself at the head of the  first line of his troops, \"the men of Soissons,\" says William the Breton,  who was present at the battle, \"being impatient and inflamed by the words  of Bishop Guerin, let out their horses at the full speed of their legs,  and attacked the enemy.  But the Flemish knights prick not forward to the  encounter, indignant that the first charge against them was not made by  knights, as would have been seemly, and remain motionless at their post.  The men of Soissons, meanwhile, see no need of dealing softly with them  and humoring them, so thrust them roughly, upset them from their horses,  slay a many of them, and force them to leave their place or defend  themselves, willy nilly.  At last, the Chevalier Eustace, scorning the  burghers and proud of his illustrious ancestors, moves out into the  middle of the plain, and with haughty voice, roars, \"Death to the  French!\"  The battle soon became general and obstinate; it was a  multitude of hand-to-hand fights in the midst of a confused melley.  In this melley, the knights of the Emperor Otho did not forget the  instructions he had given them before the engagement: they sought out the  King of France himself, to aim their blows at him; and ere long they knew  him by the presence of the royal standard, and made their way almost up  to him.  The communes, and chiefly those of Corbeil, Amiens, Beauvais,  Compiegne, and Arras, thereupon pierced through the battalions of the  knights and placed themselves in front of the king, when some German  infantry crept up round Philip, and with hooks and light lances threw him  down from his horse; but a small body of knights who had remained by him  overthrew, dispersed, and slew these infantry, and the king, recovering  himself more quickly than had been expected, leaped upon another horse,  and dashed again into the melley.  Then danger threatened the Emperor  Otho in his turn.  The French drove back those about him, and came right  up to him; a sword thrust, delivered with vigor, entered the brain of  Otho's horse; the horse, mortally wounded, reared up and turned his head  in the direction whence he had come; and the emperor, thus carried away,  showed his back to the French, and was off in full flight.  \"Ye will see  his face no more to-day,\" said Philip to his followers: and he said  truly.  In vain did William des Barres, the first knight of his day in  strength, and valor, and renown, dash off in pursuit of the emperor;  twice he was on the point of seizing him, but Otho escaped, thanks to the  swiftness of his horse and the great number of his German knights, who,  whilst their emperor was flying, were fighting to a miracle.  But their  bravery saved only their master; the battle of Bouvines was lost for the  Anglo-Germano-Flemish coalition.  It was still prolonged for several  hours; but in the evening it was over, and the prisoners of note were  conducted to Philip Augustus.  There were five counts, Ferrand of  Flanders, Renaud of Boulogne, William of Salisbury, a natural brother of  King John, Otho of Tecklemburg, and Conrad of Dartmund; and twenty-five  barons \"bearing their own standard to battle.\"  Philip Augustus spared  all their lives; sent away the Earl of Salisbury to his brother, confined  the Count of Boulogne at Peronne, where he was subjected \"to very  rigorous imprisonment, with chains so short that he could scarce move one  step,\" and as for the Count of Flanders, his sometime regent, Philip  dragged him in chains in his train,    [Il"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#16)"],[1,"into the town.  After his departure his partisans forced the  barrier, charged the dumbfounded Burgundians, sent them flying along the  road to Bray, and returning on to the bridge would have cast the body of  Duke John, after stripping it, into the river; but the minister of  Montereau withstood them, and had it carried to a mill near the bridge.  \"Next day he was put in a pauper's shell, with nothing on but his shirt  and drawers, and was subsequently interred at the church of Notre-Dame de  Montereau, without winding-sheet and without pall over his grave.\"    [Illustration: '\"Into the River!\"'----77]    The enmities of the Orleannese and the Armagnacs had obtained  satisfaction; but they were transferred to the hearts of the Burgundians.  After twelve years of public crime and misfortune the murder of Louis of  Orleans had been avenged; and should not that of John of Burgundy be, in  its turn?  Wherever the direct power or the indirect influence of the  Duke of Burgundy was predominant, there was a burst of indignation and  vindictive passion.  As soon as the Count of Charolais, Philip,  afterwards called the Good, heard at Ghent, where he happened at that  time to be, of his father's murder, he was proclaimed Duke of Burgundy.  \"Michelle,\" said he to his wife, sister of the _dauphin_, Charles, \"your  brother has murdered my father.\"  The princess burst into tears; but the  new duke calmed her by saying that nothing could alter the love and  confidence he felt towards her.  At Troyes Queen Isabel showed more anger  than any one else against her son, the _dauphin_; and she got a letter  written by King Charles VI. to the dowager Duchess of Burgundy, begging  her, her and her children, \"to set in motion all their relatives,  friends, and vassals to avenge Duke John.\"  At Paris, on the 12th of  September, the next day but one after the murder, the chancellor, the  parliament, the provost royal, the provost of tradesmen, and all the  councillors and officers of the king assembled, \"together with great  number of nobles and burgesses and a great multitude of people,\" who all  swore \"to oppose with their bodies and all their might the enterprise of  the criminal breakers of the peace, and to prosecute the cause of  vengeance and reparation against those who were guilty of the death and  homicide of the late Duke of Burgundy.\"  Independently of party-passion,  such was, in Northern and Eastern France, the general and spontaneous  sentiment of the people.  The _dauphin_ and his councillors, in order to  explain and justify their act, wrote in all directions to say that,  during the interview, Duke John had answered the _dauphin_ \"with mad  words .  .  .  He had felt for his sword in order to attack and outrage  our person, the which, as we have since found out, he aspired to place in  subjection .  .  .  but, through his own madness, met death instead.\"  But these assertions found little credence, and one of the two knights  who were singled out by the _dauphin_ to accompany him on to the bridge  of Montereau, Sire de Barbazan, who had been a friend of the Duke of  Orleans and of the Count of Armagnac, said vehemently to the authors of  the plot, \"You have destroyed our master's honor and heritage, and I  would rather have died than be present at this day's work, even though I  had not been there to no purpose.\"  But it was not long before an event,  easy to foresee, counterbalanced this general impression and restored  credit and strength to the _dauphin_ and his party.  Henry V., King of  England, as soon as he heard about the murder of Duke John, set himself  to work to derive from it all the advantages he anticipated.  \"A great  loss,\" said he, \"is the Duke of Burgundy; he was a good and true knight  and an honorable prince; but through his death we are by God's help at  the summit of our wishes.  We shall thus, in spite of all Frenchmen,  possess Dame Catherine, whom we have so much desired.\"  As early as the  24th of September, 1419, Henry V. gave full powers to certain of his  people to treat \"with the illustrious city of Paris and the other towns  in adherence to the said city.\"  On the 17th of October was opened at  Arras a congress between the plenipotentiaries of England and those of  Burgundy.  On the 20th of November a special truce was granted to the  Parisians, whilst Henry V., in concert with Duke Philip of Burgundy, was  prosecuting the war against the _dauphin_.  On the 2d of December the  bases were laid of an agreement between the English and the Burgundians.  The preliminaries of the treaty, which was drawn up in accordance with  these bases, were signed on the 9th of April, 1420, by King Charles VI.,  and on the 20th communicated at Paris by the chancellor of France to the  parliament and to all the religious and civil, royal and municipal  authorities of the capital.  After this communication, the chancellor and  the premier president of parliament went with these preliminaries to  Henry V. at Pontoise, where he set out with a division of his army for  Troyes, where the treaty, definitive and complete, was at last signed and  promulgated in the cathedral of Troyes, on the 21st of May, 1420.    Of the twenty-eight articles in this treaty, five contained its essential  points and fixed its character: 1st. The King of France, Charles VI.,  gave his daughter Catherine in marriage to Henry V., King of England.  2d. \"Our son, King Henry, shall place no hinderance or trouble in the way  of our holding and possessing as long as we live, and as at the present  time, the crown, the kingly dignity of France, and all the revenues,  proceeds, and profits which are attached thereto for the maintenance of  our state and the charges of the kingdom.  3d. It is agreed that  immediately after our death, and from that time forward, the crown and  kingdom of France, with all their rights and appurtenances, shall belong  perpetually and shall be continued to our son King Henry and his heirs.  4th. Whereas we are, at most times, prevented from advising by ourselves  and from taking part in the disposal of the affairs of our kingdom, the  power and the practice of governing and ordering the commonweal shall  belong and shall be continued, during our life, to our son King Henry,  with the counsel of the nobles and sages of the kingdom who shall obey us  and shall desire the honor and advantage of the said kingdom.  5th. Our  son King Henry shall strive with all his might, and as soon as possible,  to bring back to their obedience to us, all and each of the towns,  cities, castles, places, districts, and persons in our kingdom that  belong to the party commonly called of the _dauphin_ or Armagnac.\"    This substitution, in the near future, of an English for the French  kingship; this relinquishment, in the present, of the government of  France to the hands of an English prince nominated to become before long  her king; this authority given to the English prince to prosecute in  France, against the _dauphin_ of France, a civil war; this complete  abdication of all the rights and duties of the kingship, of paternity  and of national independence; and, to sum up all in one word, this  anti-French state-stroke accomplished by a king of France, with the  co-operation of him who was the greatest amongst French lords, to the  advantage of a foreign sovereign--there was surely in this enough to  excite the most ardent and most legitimate national feelings.  They did  not show themselves promptly or with a blaze.  The fourteenth and  fifteenth centuries, after so many military and civil troubles, had  great weaknesses and deep-seated corruption in mind and character.  Nevertheless the revulsion against the treaty of Troyes was real and  serious, even in the very heart of the party attached to the Duke of  Burgundy.  He was obliged to lay upon several of his servants formal  injunctions to swear to this peace, which seemed to them treason.  He had  great difficulty in winning John of Luxembourg and his brother Louis,  Bishop of Therouenne, over to it.  \"It is your will,\" said they; \"we will  take this oath; but if we do, we will keep it to the hour of death.\"  Many less powerful lords, who had lived a long while in the household of  Duke John the Fearless, quitted his son, and sorrowfully returned to  their own homes.  They were treated as Armagnacs, but they persisted in  calling themselves good and loyal Frenchmen.  In the duchy of Burgundy  the majority of the towns refused to take the oath to the King of  England.  The most decisive and the most helpful proof of this awakening  of national feeling was the ease experienced by the _dauphin_, who was  one day to be Charles VII., in maintaining the war which, after the  treaty of Troyes, was, in his father's and his mother's name, made upon  him by the King of England and the Duke of Burgundy.  This war lasted  more than three years.  Several towns, amongst others, Melun, Crotoy,  Meaux, and St. Riquier, offered an obstinate resistance to the attacks of  the English and Burgundians.  On the 23d of March, 1421, the _dauphin_'s  troops, commanded by Sire de la Fayette, gained a signal victory over  those of Henry V., whose brother, the Duke of Clarence, was killed in  action.  It was in Perche, Anjou, Maine, on the banks of the Loire, and  in Southern France, that the _dauphin_ found most of his enterprising and  devoted partisans.  The sojourn made by Henry V. at Paris, in December,  1420, with his wife, Queen Catherine, King Charles VI., Queen Isabel, and  the Duke of Burgundy, was not, in spite of galas and acclamations, a  substantial and durable success for him.  His dignified but haughty  manners did not please the French; and he either could not or would not  render them more easy and amiable, even with men of note who were  necessary to him.  Marshal Isle-Adam one day went to see him in camp on  war-business.  The king considered that he did not present himself with "]]]
