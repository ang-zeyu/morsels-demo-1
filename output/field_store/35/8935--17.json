[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10163"],[0,"Mohammedanism (#16)"],[1," regard the khalifs as their leaders, because they  walked in worldly ways, they have constituted themselves independently  beside and even above them; and the rulers have been obliged to conclude a  silent contract with them, each party binding itself to remain within its  own limits.[1] If this contract be observed, the legists not only are ready  to acknowledge the bad rulers of the world, but even to preach loyalty  towards them to the laity.    The most supremely popular part of the ideal of Islam, the reduction of  the whole world to Moslim authority, can only be attempted by a political  power. Notwithstanding the destructive criticism of all Moslim princes and  state officials by the canonists, it was only from them that they could  expect measures to uphold and extend the power of Islam; and on this  account they continually cherished the ideal of the Khalifate.    [Footnote 1: That the Khalifate is in no way to be compared with the  Papacy, that Islam has never regarded the Khalif as its spiritual head, I  have repeatedly explained since 1882 (in \"Nieuwe Bijdragen tot de kennis  van den Islam,\" in _Bijdr. tot de Taal, Landen Volkenkunde van Nederl.  Indie_, Volgr. 4, Deel vi, in an article, \"De Islam,\" in _De Gids_, May,  1886, in _Questions Diplomatiques et Coloniales_, 5me annee, No. 106,  etc.). I am pleased to find the same views expressed by Prof. M. Hartmann  in _Die Welt des Islams_, Bd. i., pp. 147-8.]    In the first centuries it was the duty of Mohammedans who had become  isolated, and who had for instance been conquered by \"unbelievers,\" to do  _\"hijrah,\" i.e._, emigration for Allah's sake, as the converted Arabs had  done in Mohammed's time by emigrating to Medina to strengthen the ranks of  the Faithful. This soon became impracticable, so that the legists relaxed  the prescription by concessions to \"the force of necessity.\" Resignation  was thus permitted, even recommended; but the submission to non-Musulmans  was always to be regarded as temporary and abnormal. Although the _partes  infidelium_ have grown larger and larger, the eye must be kept fixed upon  the centre, the Khalifate, where every movement towards improvement must  begin. A Western state that admits any authority of a khalif over its  Mohammedan subjects, thus acknowledges, _not_ the authority of a pope of  the Moslim Church, but in simple ignorance is feeding political programs,  which, however vain, always have the power of stirring Mohammedan masses to  confusion and excitement.    Of late years Mohammedan statesmen in their intercourse with their Western  colleagues are glad to take the latter's point of view; and, in discussion,  accept the comparison of the Khalifate with the Papacy, because they are  aware that only in this form the Khalifate can be made acceptable to powers  who have Mohammedan subjects. But for these subjects the Khalif is then  their true prince, who is temporarily hindered in the exercise of his  government, but whose right is acknowledged even by their unbelieving  masters.    In yet another respect the canonists need the aid of the temporal rulers.  An alert police is counted by them amongst the indispensable means of  securing purity of doctrine and life. They count it to the credit of  princes and governors that they enforced by violent measures seclusion and  veiling of the women, abstinence from drinking, and that they punished by  flogging the negligent with regard to fasting or attending public worship.  The political decay of Islam, the increasing number of Mohammedans under  foreign rule, appears to them, therefore, doubly dangerous, as they have  little faith in the proof of Islam's spiritual goods against life in a  freedom which to them means license.    They find that every political change, in these terrible times, is to the  prejudice of Islam, one Moslim people after another losing its independent  existence; and they regard it as equally dangerous that Moslim princes are  induced to accommodate their policy and government to new international  ideas of individual freedom, which threaten the very life of Islam. They  see the antagonism to all foreign ideas, formerly considered as a virtue  by every true Moslim, daily losing ground, and they are filled with  consternation by observing in their own ranks the contamination of  modernist ideas. The brilliant development of the system of Islam followed  the establishment of its material power; so the rapid decline of that  political power which we are witnessing makes the question urgent, whether  Islam has a spiritual essence able to survive the fall of such a material  support. It is certainly not the canonists who will detect the kernel;  \"verily we are God's and verily to Him do we return,\" they cry in helpless  amazement, and their consolation is in the old prayer: \"And lay not on us,  O our Lord, that for which we have no strength, but blot out our sins and  forgive us and have mercy upon us. Thou art our Master; grant us then to  conquer the Unbelievers!\"        IV    ISLAM AND MODERN THOUGHT      One of the most powerful factors of religious life in its higher forms is  the need of man to find in this world of changing things an imperishable  essence, to separate the eternal from the temporal and then to attach  himself to the former. Where the possibility of this operation is despaired  of, there may arise a pessimism, which finds no path of liberation from the  painful vicissitudes of life other than the annihilation of individuality.  A firm belief in a sphere of life freed from the category of time, together  with the conviction that the poetic images of that superior world current  among mankind are images and nothing else, is likely to give rise to  definitions of the Absolute by purely negative attributes and to mental  efforts having for their object the absorption of individual existence  in the indescribable infinite. Generally speaking, a high development of  intellectual life, especially an intimate acquaintance with different  religious systems, is not favourable to the continuance of elaborate  conceptions of things eternal; it will rather increase the tendency to  deprive the idea of the Transcendent of all colour and definiteness.    The naive ideas concerning the other world in the clear-cut form outlined  for them by previous generations are most likely to remain unchanged in a  religious community where intellectual intercourse is chiefly limited to  that between members of the community. There the belief is fostered that  things most appreciated and cherished in this fading world by mankind will  have an enduring existence in a world to come, and that the best of the  changing phenomena of life are eternal and will continue free from that  change, which is the principal cause of human misery. Material death will  be followed by awakening to a purer life, the idealized continuation of  life on earth, and for this reason already during this life the faithful  will find their delight in those things which they know to be everlasting.    The less faith is submitted to the control of intellect, the more numerous  the objects will be to which durable value is attributed. This is true for  different individuals as well as for one religious community as compared to  another. There are Christians attached only to the spirit of the Gospel,  Mohammedans attached only to the spirit of the Qoran. Others give a place  in their world of imperishable things to a particular translation of the  Bible in its old-fashioned orthography or to a written Qoran in preference  to a printed one. Orthodox Judaism and orthodox Islam have marked with the  stamp of eternity codes of law, whose influence has worked as an impediment  to the life of the adherents of those religions and to the free intercourse  of other people with them as well. So the Roman Catholic and many  Protestant Churches have in their organizations and in their dogmatic  systems eternalized institutions and ideas whose unchangeableness has come  to retard spiritual progress.    Among all conservative factors of human life religion must necessarily be  the most conservative, were it only because its aim is precisely to store  up and keep under its guardianship the treasures destined for eternity to  which we have alluded. Now, every new period in the history of civilization  obliges a religious community to undertake a general revision of the  contents of its treasury. It is unavoidable that the guardians on such  occasions should be in a certain measure disappointed, for they find that  some of, the goods under their care have given way to the wasting influence  of time, whilst others are in a state which gives rise to serious doubt as  to their right of being classified with lasting treasures. In reality the  loss is only an apparent one; far from impoverishing the community, it  enhances the solidity of its possessions. What remains after the sifting  process may be less imposing to the inexperienced mind; gradually the  consideration gains ground that what has been rejected was nothing but  useless rubbish which had been wrongly valued.    Sometimes it may happen that the general movement of spiritual progress  goes almost too fast, so that one revision of the stores of religion is  immediately followed by another. Then dissension is likely to arise among  the adherents of a religion; some of them come to the conclusion that there  must be an end of sifting and think it better to lock up the treasuries  once for all and to stop the dangerous enquiries; whereas others begin to  entertain doubt concerning the value even of such goods as do not yet show  any trace of decay.    The treasuries of Islam are excessively full of rubbish that has become  entirely useless; and for nine or ten centuries they have not been  submitted to a revision deserving that name. If we wish to understand the  whole or any important part of the system of Islam, we must always begin by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#16)"],[1,"opportunity to disquiet the  masses and excite them to senseless delirium.    \"It is obvious that we shall not join in this game. We exercise our most  careful judgment before publishing anything; in these serious times we  must decline to speculate in the thirst for sensation which has been  bred in the public. Rather, on the contrary, we must beg our readers  always to accept all news, WHICH NOW EMANATE ALMOST ENTIRELY FROM  OFFICIAL SOURCES,[61] with the necessary reserve.\"[62]    [Footnote 61: The emphasis is mine. Author.]    [Footnote 62: _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, August 7th.]    The author has ventured to lead his readers on a mad-brained chase after  non-existent motor-cars and mythical French gold. He hopes that his  readers' patience has not been exhausted, because the ride may prove an  instructive education in German methods and the standards of truth  accepted in a country where only might is right.    The object in view, in submitting these modern fairy-tales to the  British public, is to lay bare the pillars of truth which support the  Fatherland. During the first month of the war there was an outbreak of  brutality in Germany; contemporaneously with these horrors some million  members of the same nation flooded Belgium with dread deeds of an  indescribable nature. This is a noteworthy coincidence.    We have seen how Germans treat Germans, which makes it easier to  comprehend how Germans treated Belgians. The present chapter gives a  picture of how the German Press is worked, how popular opinion is  created and blood-lust awakened. When dealing with Germany's defence of  her Belgian horrors, we shall find that her entire case rests alone upon  the utterances of her oracles of truth: Wolff's Telegraphic Bureau and  Germany's venal, lying newspapers.    That was the reason for this mad joy-ride from end to end of the German  Empire, and that is the only apology which the author has to make for  introducing the latest contributions to Germanic mythology into an  otherwise serious work.    Incidentally we have observed that German civilians were permitted to  bear arms and did not hesitate to use them \"in defence of the  Fatherland,\" as Edmund Edel put it. The civilians were doubtless  inspired by the noble desire to grab French gold. Yet when Belgian  civilians--as Wolff's Bureau alleges--dared to defend their homes, wives  and children against the most treacherous and dastardly invasion in the  world's history--then, of course, Germany was perfectly justified in  murdering all and sundry, burning towns and hamlets and laying waste a  fertile land.          CHAPTER VI    THE DEBACLE OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS      In the second paragraph of the Social Democratic programme published  after the Halle Congress in 1890, we read: \"The German workmen's  socialistic party, although working for the present on national lines,  is aware of the international character of the workmen's movement, and  is determined to fulfil all duties accruing thereby to the working  classes, in order to make the brotherhood of all men a reality.\"    At that meeting--the first to be held after the repeal of Bismarck's  anti-socialist law--the president claimed that they had secured more  votes at the Reichstag election than any other party; they were the  strongest political party in Germany.    Since that year they have consistently increased their power, till in  the present Reichstag they have no fewer than one hundred and eleven  members, giving them almost an absolute majority.    It seems an irony of fate that at Halle in 1890 one of the speakers who  dilated on international brotherhood and the inseparable bonds which  bound Belgian and German workmen--was a Belgian delegate! Singer, in  reporting on the doings of the representatives in the Reichstag, said:  \"We consider peace among the nations to be an indispensable preliminary  for the improvement of social conditions. We vote against expenditure  for military purposes, because we are convinced that this continuous  arming, accompanied by the constant improvement of murderous weapons,  must be ended. It is contradictory to the civilizing task of the nations  for them to be armed to the teeth, lying in wait for the moment when  they can devour each other.    \"Militarism is an evil for the nations; its burdens cannot be borne for  ever, and even to-day the nations are collapsing under them. Modern  conditions are unbearable; out of them spring ever-increasing armaments,  and at last a time will come when war must break out, because the state  of modern armed peace will one day have become impossible.\"    Another authoritative pronouncement from the report[63] of the Social  Democratic Congress in Erfurt, 1891, deserves mention. It is a passage  from a speech delivered by the elder Liebknecht in the Reichstag: \"As  regards the defence of the Fatherland all parties will be united when it  is necessary to meet an outside enemy. In that moment no party will  shirk its duty.\"    [Footnote 63: \"Protokoll ueber die Verhandlungen des Parteitags der Soz.  Dem. Partei Deutschlands zu Erfurt, 1891.\"]    This is an instance of what Germans call _Rueckversicherung_, or a  covering insurance. Having pledged themselves never to leave the  Fatherland in the lurch--and the pledge was repeated on many  occasions--they were free to babble to French, English and Italian  Socialists about the blessings of internationalism, general strikes, and  eternal peace. But there is no single instance on record to show that  German Socialists considered any other benefits of internationalism,  except those which served the purposes of their own nationalism.    At Halle, 1890, Liebknecht said: \"These ideas are indisputably correct.  Nobody,[64] no matter how enthusiastic he may be for the international  cause, will dare to maintain that we have no national duties. National  and international are not opposing principles. The word 'national' must  be rightly understood. It includes only a certain, limited portion of  international humanity. The part belongs to the whole, and international  merely means going beyond the boundary-posts of the nation, the narrower  limits of the native land; to extend one's horizon to include the whole;  to consider humanity as one family and the world as a home.\"    [Footnote 64: Liebknecht was wrong. There are dupes who hold that their  international obligations come before their national duties, and  unfortunately in the ranks of these traitors, English M.P.'s may be  found, who receive L400 per annum from the British State, presumably to  aid them in injuring the British cause.]    The error into which British Socialists have fallen--or been led--is  their attitude towards militarism. German Democrats have never denounced  the bearing of arms; they have admitted that arms will always be  necessary, pre-supposing that the world continues along the same lines  of development as heretofore.    They have only objected to the existing _form_[65] of militarism, but  otherwise they have always been unanimous that military training should  be compulsory and universal. Their British _Genossen_ (comrades) have  either misunderstood or wilfully perverted these teachings. German  Socialists have unswervingly insisted upon every man learning the use of  arms, while their British followers have preached absolute disarmament  and done their utmost to betray this country into weakening herself  below the minimum necessary to guard the land, and to maintain the  country's pledges to the world.    [Footnote 65: Kautsky: \"Die Internationalitaet und der Krieg\" (Vorwaerts  Publishing House, Berlin, 1915), p. 26. \"We have fought against the  military system not to make the land defenceless, but in order to  introduce another system in its place, which will give us the necessary  guarantees that the army will always be the tool of the civil  authorities and never their master. When the latter is the case we call  such a condition 'militarism,' and it is against that alone that we  fight.\" Seeing that military power is absolutely subordinated to the  civil authorities in the case of Great Britain (Mutiny Acts), then  according to the principles of German Socialists their British  colleagues were wrong in all the efforts which they have made against  the armed powers of these islands.]    In Halle, Herr Bebel made this statement: \"I have already made it clear  that I consider the efforts of the so-called peace friends towards  disarmament to be useless (_aussichtslos_), because it is unthinkable  that the rival States would agree to legal restrictions concerning  disarmament. If such were made, each would endeavour by secret  preparations to out-do the other. War and national enmity are necessary  products of society, and the existing class distinctions.\"    The Germans were quite logical in this matter; in effect they said--the  existing States and forms of government make militarism necessary, and  war inevitable. Therefore we declare war to the knife on every existing  government, including Russian Czarism, British constitutionalism, German  autocracy and American republicanism. They are one and all rotten,  unjust and inhuman. Our programme includes their complete overthrow and  the erection in their stead of a _Volksstaat_ (People's State).    The position is perfectly simple, and to those who are sufficiently  ignorant and naive this programme promises an universal salvation, as  delirious in its joy as that expected by African races when bending the  knee before images of wood and stone. German Socialists are pledged just  as irrevocably to the doctrines of brute force as are the Junker and  military powers in the German Fatherland. What is their industrial and  class warfare but an attempt to enforce the doctrine of might is right?    In the official programme drawn up at Erfurt, 1891, there is a paragraph  stating a claim for _uneingeschraenktes Koalitionsrecht_ (absolute and"]]]
