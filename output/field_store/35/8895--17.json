It was after sundown before I reached the creek  and camped. I have named this creek Davenport Creek, after the Honourable  Mr. Davenport, M.L.C.    Monday, 30th May, Davenport Creek. Started at sunrise determined to  follow down the creek, for I think there must be water somewhere before  it enters the plain. The flow is to the east. At five miles came upon a  beautiful spring in the bed of the creek, for which I am truly thankful.  I have named this The Spring of Hope. It is a little brackish, not from  salt, but soda, and runs a good stream of water. I have lived upon far  worse water than this: to me it is of the utmost importance, and keeps my  retreat open. I can go from here to Adelaide at any time of the year, and  in any sort of season. Camped for the rest of the day. Latitude, 28  degrees 33 minutes 34 seconds.    Tuesday, 31st May, The Spring of Hope. Shoeing horses, and repairing  various things.    Wednesday, 1st June, The Spring of Hope. Not being satisfied with my  hurried view of the salt clay-pan that I visited on the 25th ultimo, I  have sent Muller to-day to examine it for springs, before I proceed to  the north-west. On a further examination of this water, I find a very  large portion of magnesia in it, and also salt, but very little. Muller  has returned, having been down the creek, and, as I expected, has found a  small spring of very good water on the banks of the salt creek. I expect  there will be others. I shall move down there to-morrow and examine it. I  expect we have fallen upon the line of springs again, which I hope will  continue towards the north. No rain seems to have fallen here for a long  time.    Thursday, 2nd June, The Spring of Hope. Started at 9 o'clock for the  springs, and arrived there in the afternoon. Travelled over a stony but  very good feeding country, which became better as we approached the  springs. There is a creek with a large water hole, and around the small  hills are numerous springs. On the banks of the creek and round the  springs an immense quantity of rushes, bulrushes, and other water-plants  are growing. The quantity of land they cover is very great, amounting to  several square miles. Some of the springs are choked up, others are  running, though not so active as those further to the south. Round about  them there is a thin crust of saltpetre, magnesia, and salt. The water of  these springs is very good, but that of the creek is a little brackish,  but will do very well for cattle. Some of the holes in the creek are  rather salt. There is enough of good water for the largest station in the  colony. Round the small hill, where I am now camped, there are twelve  springs, and the water is first-rate. I have named them Hawker Springs,  after G.C. Hawker, Esquire, M.L.A.* (* Now the Honourable G.C. Hawker,  Speaker of the House of Assembly at Adelaide.) The hills are composed of  slate, mica, quartz (resembling those of the gold country), and  ironstone. Latitude, 28 degrees 24 minutes 17 seconds. One of the horses  seems to be very unwell to-day; he has endeavoured to lie down two or  three times during the journey, but I hope he will be better by the  morning.    Friday, 3rd June, Hawker Springs. I find that the horse is too unwell to  proceed. I shall give him another day, for fear I should lose him  altogether. I sent Muller to see if there are any springs round the hill  about six miles to the east. He states that the creek flows past that  hill, and on towards other hills of the same kind. The springs continue  to within half a mile of the hill, where he found two large springs  running over, covered with long reeds. I do not doubt but that they still  continue on towards the lake, (wherever that may be), which I intend to  examine on my return.    Saturday, 4th June, Hawker Springs. This morning the horse does not look  much better, but still I must push on. Started at 8 towards the highest  point of the next range. At one mile struck a gum creek coming from the  Davenport range, and running to the north of east; the bed sandy and  grassy. At four miles another gum creek of the same description, with the  gum-trees stunted. At eight miles and a half struck three creeks joining  at about a quarter of a mile to the east; the centre one is gum, and the  other two myall. At twelve miles changed my course to 29 degrees to  examine three dark-coloured hills, where I think there will be springs.  At a mile and a quarter came upon a small batch of springs round the  north side of the hills in a broad grassy valley, with plenty of good  water. Changed my course again to 318 degrees towards the highest point  of the range. At one mile a myall and gum creek; at three miles another  gum creek; at seven miles a very large and broad gum creek, spread out  into numerous channels. I have not the least doubt but there is water  above and below, judging from the number of tracks of natives and emus  that have been up and down the creek. As this is the largest creek that I  have passed, and is likely to become as good as Chambers Creek, which it  very much resembles, I have called it The Blyth, after the Honourable  Arthur Blyth. I have named the range to the east The Hanson Range, after  the Honourable R.D. Hanson. At nine miles and a half attained the highest  point of the range, and built a cone of stones thereon, and have named it  Mount Younghusband, after the Honourable William Younghusband. From it I  had a good view of the surrounding country, which seems to be plentifully  supplied with springs. To the north-west is another isolated range like  this; I should think it is about seven hundred feet high. I have named it  Mount Kingston, after the Honourable G.S. Kingston, Speaker of the House  of Assembly. To the north the broken ranges continue, and in the distance  there is a long flat-topped range, broken in some places. It seems to be  closing upon my course on the last bearing. I cannot judge of the  distance, the mirage being so great. Descended from the mount, and  proceeded on a bearing of 336 degrees towards a spring that I saw from  the top. As we were rounding the mount to the east, we found eight  springs before we halted, in a distance of three miles; some were  running, and others were choked up, but soft and boggy. At dark arrived  at another batch of springs--not those that I intended going to--they are  on the banks of a small creek, close to and coming from the range; they  are not so active as the others, and taste a little brackish; they are  coated with soda, saltpetre, and salt. The horse seems to be very ill; he  has again attempted to lie down two or three times. I cannot imagine what  is the matter with him.    Sunday, 5th June, Mount Younghusband. I must remain where I am to-day;  the horse is so bad that he cannot proceed; he neither eats nor drinks. I  have sent Muller to the west side of the mount to see the extent of the  springs; they are on the banks of a creek which has brackish water in it,  large and deep, and a great quantity of rushes. The water comes from the  limestone banks which are covered with soda. He rode round the mount: it  is all the same, and the feed is splendid right to the top of the mount.  It is a wonderful country, scarcely to be believed. I have had one of the  springs opened to-day, and the water to-night tastes excellent; it could  not be better. Native tracks about; I am surprised we see none of them;  we are passing old fires constantly. Latitude, 28 degrees 1 minute 32  seconds.    Monday, 6th June, Mount Younghusband. The horses being some distance off,  and my horse requiring a shoe, I was unable to make a start until 10  o'clock, on a bearing of 307 degrees 45 minutes, passing Mount Kingston  on the south-west side. At three-quarters of a mile came upon the springs  that I intended to have camped at on Saturday night: they are flowing in  a stream strong enough to supply any number of cattle. I named them The  Barrow Springs, after J.U. Barrow, Esquire, M.L.A. At four miles and a  half struck a large broad valley, in which are the largest springs I have  yet seen. The flow of water from them is immense, coming in numerous  streams, and the country around is beautiful. I have named these The  Freeling Springs, after the Honourable Major Freeling, M.L.C. After  leaving the springs I ascended a rough stony hill, to have a view of  them, but I could not see them all, their extent is so great. They extend  to under the Kingston range, and how much further I do not know. From  this point I changed my course to 322 degrees. I can just see the top of  a distant range, for which I will go on that bearing. At one mile and a  half crossed a broad gum salt creek, coming from the west, with a  quantity of salt water in it. I have named this Peake Creek, after C.J.  Peake, Esquire, M.L.A. After crossing this, we travelled over low rises  with quartz, ironstone, and slate; the quartz predominating. Herrgott and  Muller, who have both been long in the Victoria gold diggings, say that  they have not seen any place that resembles those diggings so much as  this does. The country seems as if it were covered with snow, from the  quantity of quartz. At eleven miles passed a brackish water creek and  salt lagoon; searched for springs but could find none, although reeds and  rushes abound, but no water on the surface. I thence proceeded  three-quarters of a mile, and struck a gum creek with a number of  channels and very long water holes, but the water is brackish; it might  do for cattle. This I have named The Neale, after J.B. Neale, Esquire,  M.L.A. I think by following it down, there will be a large quantity of  water, and good, and that it will become a very important creek. No  person could wish for a better country for feed than that we have passed  over"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8914"],[0,"England, My England (#15)"],[1,"a furtive, haggard look; his eyes were as if glazed with  misery.    'I'm so glad,' she said, in sheer perplexity.    'Yes,' said Maurice.    He was indeed so glad. Isabel took his hand with both hers, and held it  fast.    'You'll be happier now, dear,' she said.    But she was watching Bertie. She knew that he had one desire--to escape  from this intimacy, this friendship, which had been thrust upon him. He  could not bear it that he had been touched by the blind man, his insane  reserve broken in. He was like a mollusk whose shell is broken.          _MONKEY NUTS_      At first Joe thought the job O.K. He was loading hay on the trucks, along  with Albert, the corporal. The two men were pleasantly billeted in a  cottage not far from the station: they were their own masters, for Joe  never thought of Albert as a master. And the little sidings of the tiny  village station was as pleasant a place as you could wish for. On one  side, beyond the line, stretched the woods: on the other, the near side,  across a green smooth field red houses were dotted among flowering apple  trees. The weather being sunny, work being easy, Albert, a real good pal,  what life could be better! After Flanders, it was heaven itself.    Albert, the corporal, was a clean-shaven, shrewd-looking fellow of about  forty. He seemed to think his one aim in life was to be full of fun and  nonsense. In repose, his face looked a little withered, old. He was a  very good pal to Joe, steady, decent and grave under all his 'mischief';  for his mischief was only his laborious way of skirting his own _ennui_.    Joe was much younger than Albert--only twenty-three. He was a tallish,  quiet youth, pleasant looking. He was of a slightly better class than his  corporal, more personable. Careful about his appearance, he shaved every  day. 'I haven't got much of a face,' said Albert. 'If I was to shave  every day like you, Joe, I should have none.'    There was plenty of life in the little goods-yard: three porter youths,  a continual come and go of farm wagons bringing hay, wagons with timber  from the woods, coal carts loading at the trucks. The black coal seemed  to make the place sleepier, hotter. Round the big white gate the  station-master's children played and his white chickens walked, whilst  the stationmaster himself, a young man getting too fat, helped his wife  to peg out the washing on the clothes line in the meadow.    The great boat-shaped wagons came up from Playcross with the hay. At  first the farm-men waggoned it. On the third day one of the land-girls  appeared with the first load, drawing to a standstill easily at the head  of her two great horses. She was a buxom girl, young, in linen overalls  and gaiters. Her face was ruddy, she had large blue eyes.    'Now that's the waggoner for us, boys,' said the corporal loudly.    'Whoa!' she said to her horses; and then to the corporal: 'Which boys do  you mean?'    'We are the pick of the bunch. That's Joe, my pal. Don't you let on that  my name's Albert,' said the corporal to his private. 'I'm the corporal.'    'And I'm Miss Stokes,' said the land-girl coolly, 'if that's all the boys  you are.'    'You know you couldn't want more, Miss Stokes,' said Albert politely.  Joe, who was bare-headed, whose grey flannel sleeves were rolled up to  the elbow, and whose shirt was open at the breast, looked modestly aside  as if he had no part in the affair.    'Are you on this job regular, then?' said the corporal to Miss Stokes.    'I don't know for sure,' she said, pushing a piece of hair under her hat,  and attending to her splendid horses.    'Oh, make it a certainty,' said Albert.    She did not reply. She turned and looked over the two men coolly. She was  pretty, moderately blonde, with crisp hair, a good skin, and large blue  eyes. She was strong, too, and the work went on leisurely and easily.    'Now!' said the corporal, stopping as usual to look round, 'pleasant  company makes work a pleasure--don't hurry it, boys.' He stood on the  truck surveying the world. That was one of his great and absorbing  occupations: to stand and look out on things in general. Joe, also  standing on the truck, also turned round to look what was to be seen. But  he could not become blankly absorbed, as Albert could.    Miss Stokes watched the two men from under her broad felt hat. She had  seen hundreds of Alberts, khaki soldiers standing in loose attitudes,  absorbed in watching nothing in particular. She had seen also a good many  Joes, quiet, good-looking young soldiers with half-averted faces. But  there was something in the turn of Joe's head, and something in his  quiet, tender-looking form, young and fresh--which attracted her eye. As  she watched him closely from below, he turned as if he felt her, and his  dark-blue eye met her straight, light-blue gaze. He faltered and turned  aside again and looked as if he were going to fall off the truck. A  slight flush mounted under the girl's full, ruddy face. She liked him.    Always, after this, when she came into the sidings with her team, it was  Joe she looked for. She acknowledged to herself that she was sweet on  him. But Albert did all the talking. He was so full of fun and nonsense.  Joe was a very shy bird, very brief and remote in his answers. Miss  Stokes was driven to indulge in repartee with Albert, but she fixed her  magnetic attention on the younger fellow. Joe would talk with Albert, and  laugh at his jokes. But Miss Stokes could get little out of him. She had  to depend on her silent forces. They were more effective than might be  imagined.    Suddenly, on Saturday afternoon, at about two o'clock, Joe received a  bolt from the blue--a telegram: 'Meet me Belbury Station 6.00 p.m. today.  M.S.' He knew at once who M.S. was. His heart melted, he felt weak as if  he had had a blow.    'What's the trouble, boy?' asked Albert anxiously.    'No--no trouble--it's to meet somebody.' Joe lifted his dark-blue eyes in  confusion towards his corporal.    'Meet somebody!' repeated the corporal, watching his young pal with keen  blue eyes. 'It's all right, then; nothing wrong?'    'No--nothing wrong. I'm not going,' said Joe.    Albert was old and shrewd enough to see that nothing more should be said  before the housewife. He also saw that Joe did not want to take him into  confidence. So he held his peace, though he was piqued.    The two soldiers went into town, smartened up. Albert knew a fair  number of the boys round about; there would be plenty of gossip in the  market-place, plenty of lounging in groups on the Bath Road, watching the  Saturday evening shoppers. Then a modest drink or two, and the movies.  They passed an agreeable, casual, nothing-in-particular evening, with  which Joe was quite satisfied. He thought of Belbury Station, and of  M.S. waiting there. He had not the faintest intention of meeting her. And  he had not the faintest intention of telling Albert.    And yet, when the two men were in their bedroom, half undressed, Joe  suddenly held out the telegram to his corporal, saying: 'What d'you think  of that?'    Albert was just unbuttoning his braces. He desisted, took the telegram  form, and turned towards the candle to read it.    '_Meet me Belbury Station 6.00 p.m. today. M.S._,' he read, _sotto voce_.  His face took on its fun-and-nonsense look.    'Who's M.S.?' he asked, looking shrewdly at Joe.    'You know as well as I do,' said Joe, non-committal.    'M.S.,' repeated Albert. 'Blamed if I know, boy. Is it a woman?'    The conversation was carried on in tiny voices, for fear of disturbing  the householders.    'I don't know,' said Joe, turning. He looked full at Albert, the two men  looked straight into each other's eyes. There was a lurking grin in each  of them.    'Well, I'm--_blamed_!' said Albert at last, throwing the telegram down  emphatically on the bed.    'Wha-at?' said Joe, grinning rather sheepishly, his eyes clouded none the  less.    Albert sat on the bed and proceeded to undress, nodding his head with  mock gravity all the while. Joe watched him foolishly.    'What?' he repeated faintly.    Albert looked up at him with a knowing look.    'If that isn't coming it quick, boy!' he said. 'What the blazes! What ha'  you bin doing?'    'Nothing!' said Joe.    Albert slowly shook his head as he sat on the side of the bed.    'Don't happen to me when I've bin doin' nothing,' he said. And he  proceeded to pull off his stockings.    Joe turned away, looking at himself in the mirror as he unbuttoned his  tunic.    'You didn't want to keep the appointment?' Albert asked, in a changed  voice, from the bedside.    Joe did not answer for a moment. Then he said:    'I made no appointment.'    'I'm not saying you did, boy. Don't be nasty about it. I mean you didn't  want to answer the--unknown person's summons--shall I put it that way?'    'No,' said Joe.    'What was the deterring motive?' asked Albert, who was now lying on his  back in bed.    'Oh,' said Joe, suddenly looking round rather haughtily. 'I didn't want  to.' He had a well-balanced head, and could take on a sudden distant  bearing.    'Didn't want to--didn't cotton on, like. Well--_they be artful, the  women_--' he mimicked his landlord. 'Come on into bed, boy. Don't loiter  about as if you'd lost something.'    Albert turned over, to sleep.    On Monday Miss Stokes turned up as usual, striding beside her team. Her  'whoa!' was resonant and challenging, she looked up at the truck as her  steeds came to a standstill. Joe had turned aside, and had his face  averted from her. She glanced him over--save for his slender succulent  tenderness she would have despised him. She sized him up in a steady  look. Then she turned to Albert, who was looking down at her and smiling  in his mischievous turn. She knew his aspects by now. She looked straight  back at him, though her eyes were hot. He saluted her.    'Beautiful morning, Miss Stokes.'    'Very!' she replied.    'Handsome"]]]
