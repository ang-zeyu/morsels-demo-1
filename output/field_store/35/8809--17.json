It occurred instantly to her, that  Jenny had scarce ever been out of her own house while she lived with  her. The leaning over the chair, the sudden starting up, the Latin,  the smile, and many other things, rushed upon her all at once. The  satisfaction her husband expressed in the departure of Jenny, appeared  now to be only dissembled; again, in the same instant, to be real; but  yet to confirm her jealousy, proceeding from satiety, and a hundred  other bad causes. In a word, she was convinced of her husband's guilt,  and immediately left the assembly in confusion.    As fair Grimalkin, who, though the youngest of the feline family,  degenerates not in ferocity from the elder branches of her house, and  though inferior in strength, is equal in fierceness to the noble tiger  himself, when a little mouse, whom it hath long tormented in sport,  escapes from her clutches for a while, frets, scolds, growls, swears;  but if the trunk, or box, behind which the mouse lay hid be again  removed, she flies like lightning on her prey, and, with envenomed  wrath, bites, scratches, mumbles, and tears the little animal.    Not with less fury did Mrs Partridge fly on the poor pedagogue. Her  tongue, teeth, and hands, fell all upon him at once. His wig was in an  instant torn from his head, his shirt from his back, and from his face  descended five streams of blood, denoting the number of claws with  which nature had unhappily armed the enemy.    Mr Partridge acted for some time on the defensive only; indeed he  attempted only to guard his face with his hands; but as he found that  his antagonist abated nothing of her rage, he thought he might, at  least, endeavour to disarm her, or rather to confine her arms; in  doing which her cap fell off in the struggle, and her hair being too  short to reach her shoulders, erected itself on her head; her stays  likewise, which were laced through one single hole at the bottom,  burst open; and her breasts, which were much more redundant than her  hair, hung down below her middle; her face was likewise marked with  the blood of her husband: her teeth gnashed with rage; and fire, such  as sparkles from a smith's forge, darted from her eyes. So that,  altogether, this Amazonian heroine might have been an object of terror  to a much bolder man than Mr Partridge.    He had, at length, the good fortune, by getting possession of her  arms, to render those weapons which she wore at the ends of her  fingers useless; which she no sooner perceived, than the softness of  her sex prevailed over her rage, and she presently dissolved in tears,  which soon after concluded in a fit.    That small share of sense which Mr Partridge had hitherto preserved  through this scene of fury, of the cause of which he was hitherto  ignorant, now utterly abandoned him. He ran instantly into the street,  hallowing out that his wife was in the agonies of death, and  beseeching the neighbours to fly with the utmost haste to her  assistance. Several good women obeyed his summons, who entering his  house, and applying the usual remedies on such occasions, Mrs  Partridge was at length, to the great joy of her husband, brought to  herself.    As soon as she had a little recollected her spirits, and somewhat  composed herself with a cordial, she began to inform the company of  the manifold injuries she had received from her husband; who, she  said, was not contented to injure her in her bed; but, upon her  upbraiding him with it, had treated her in the cruelest manner  imaginable; had tore her cap and hair from her head, and her stays  from her body, giving her, at the same time, several blows, the marks  of which she should carry to the grave.    The poor man, who bore on his face many more visible marks of the  indignation of his wife, stood in silent astonishment at this  accusation; which the reader will, I believe, bear witness for him,  had greatly exceeded the truth; for indeed he had not struck her once;  and this silence being interpreted to be a confession of the charge by  the whole court, they all began at once, _una voce_, to rebuke and  revile him, repeating often, that none but a coward ever struck a  woman.    Mr Partridge bore all this patiently; but when his wife appealed to  the blood on her face, as an evidence of his barbarity, he could not  help laying claim to his own blood, for so it really was; as he  thought it very unnatural, that this should rise up (as we are taught  that of a murdered person often doth) in vengeance against him.    To this the women made no other answer, than that it was a pity it had  not come from his heart, instead of his face; all declaring, that, if  their husbands should lift their hands against them, they would have  their hearts' bloods out of their bodies.    After much admonition for what was past, and much good advice to Mr  Partridge for his future behaviour, the company at length departed,  and left the husband and wife to a personal conference together, in  which Mr Partridge soon learned the cause of all his sufferings.        Chapter v.    Containing much matter to exercise the judgment and reflection of the  reader.      I believe it is a true observation, that few secrets are divulged to  one person only; but certainly, it would be next to a miracle that a  fact of this kind should be known to a whole parish, and not transpire  any farther.    And, indeed, a very few days had past, before the country, to use a  common phrase, rung of the schoolmaster of Little Baddington; who was  said to have beaten his wife in the most cruel manner. Nay, in some  places it was reported he had murdered her; in others, that he had  broke her arms; in others, her legs: in short, there was scarce an  injury which can be done to a human creature, but what Mrs Partridge  was somewhere or other affirmed to have received from her husband.    The cause of this quarrel was likewise variously reported; for as some  people said that Mrs Partridge had caught her husband in bed with his  maid, so many other reasons, of a very different kind, went abroad.  Nay, some transferred the guilt to the wife, and the jealousy to the  husband.    Mrs Wilkins had long ago heard of this quarrel; but, as a different  cause from the true one had reached her ears, she thought proper to  conceal it; and the rather, perhaps, as the blame was universally laid  on Mr Partridge; and his wife, when she was servant to Mr Allworthy,  had in something offended Mrs Wilkins, who was not of a very forgiving  temper.    But Mrs Wilkins, whose eyes could see objects at a distance, and who  could very well look forward a few years into futurity, had perceived  a strong likelihood of Captain Blifil's being hereafter her master;  and as she plainly discerned that the captain bore no great goodwill  to the little foundling, she fancied it would be rendering him an  agreeable service, if she could make any discoveries that might lessen  the affection which Mr Allworthy seemed to have contracted for this  child, and which gave visible uneasiness to the captain, who could not  entirely conceal it even before Allworthy himself; though his wife,  who acted her part much better in public, frequently recommended to  him her own example, of conniving at the folly of her brother, which,  she said, she at least as well perceived, and as much resented, as any  other possibly could.    Mrs Wilkins having therefore, by accident, gotten a true scent of the  above story,--though long after it had happened, failed not to satisfy  herself thoroughly of all the particulars; and then acquainted the  captain, that she had at last discovered the true father of the little  bastard, which she was sorry, she said, to see her master lose his  reputation in the country, by taking so much notice of.    The captain chid her for the conclusion of her speech, as an improper  assurance in judging of her master's actions: for if his honour, or  his understanding, would have suffered the captain to make an alliance  with Mrs Wilkins, his pride would by no means have admitted it. And to  say the truth, there is no conduct less politic, than to enter into  any confederacy with your friend's servants against their master: for  by these means you afterwards become the slave of these very servants;  by whom you are constantly liable to be betrayed. And this  consideration, perhaps it was, which prevented Captain Blifil from  being more explicit with Mrs Wilkins, or from encouraging the abuse  which she had bestowed on Allworthy.    But though he declared no satisfaction to Mrs Wilkins at this  discovery, he enjoyed not a little from it in his own mind, and  resolved to make the best use of it he was able.    He kept this matter a long time concealed within his own breast, in  hopes that Mr Allworthy might hear it from some other person; but Mrs  Wilkins, whether she resented the captain's behaviour, or whether his  cunning was beyond her, and she feared the discovery might displease  him, never afterwards opened her lips about the matter.    I have thought it somewhat strange, upon reflection, that the  housekeeper never acquainted Mrs Blifil with this news, as women are  more inclined to communicate all pieces of intelligence to their own  sex, than to ours. The only way, as it appears to me, of solving this  difficulty, is, by imputing it to that distance which was now grown  between the lady and the housekeeper: whether this arose from a  jealousy in Mrs Blifil, that Wilkins showed too great a respect to the  foundling; for while she was endeavouring to ruin the little infant,  in order to ingratiate herself with the captain, she was every day  more and more commending it before Allworthy, as his fondness for it  every day increased. This, notwithstanding all the care she took at  other times to express the direct contrary to Mrs Blifil, perhaps  offended that delicate lady,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6603"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage : 600-1776 King Aethelbert - King George III (#15)"],[1,"ordered the  form of proof, such as compurgatory oath and ordeal. They were  customarily thegns, often twelve in number. They, as well as the  king and the earl, received part of the profits of justice.  Summary procedure was followed when a criminal was caught in the  act or seized after a hue and cry. Every freeman over age twelve  had to be in a hundred and had to follow the hue and cry.    \"No one shall make distraint [seizure of personal property out of  the possession of an alleged wrong-doer into the custody of the  party injured, to procure a satisfaction for a wrong committed] of  property until he has appealed for justice in the hundred court  and shire court\".    In 997, King Ethelred in a law code ordered the sheriff and twelve  leading magnates of each shire to swear to accuse no innocent man,  nor conceal any guilty one. This was the germ of the later assize,  and later still the jury.    The integrity of the judicial system was protected by certain  penalties: for swearing a false oath, bot as determined by a  cleric who has heard his confession, or, if he has not confessed,  denial of burial in consecrated ground. Also a perjurer lost his  oath-worthiness. Swearing a false oath or perjury was also  punishable by loss of one's hand or half one's wergeld. A lord  denying justice, as by upholding an evil-doing thegn of his,  had  to pay 120s. to the king for his disobedience. Furthermore, if a  lord protected a theow of his who had stolen, he had to forfeit  the theow and pay his wer, for the first offense, and he was  liable for all he property, for subsequent offenses. There was a  bot for anyone harboring a convicted offender. If anyone failed to  attend the gemot thrice after being summoned, he was to pay the  king a fine for his disobedience. If he did not pay this fine or  do right, the chief men of the burh were to ride to him, and take  all his property to put into surety. If he did not know of a  person who would be his surety, he was to be imprisoned. Failing  that, he was to be killed. But if he escaped, anyone who harbored  him, knowing him to be a fugitive, would be liable pay his wer.  Anyone who avenged a thief without wounding anyone, had to pay the  king 120s. as wite for the assault.    \"And if anyone is so rich or belongs to so powerful a kindred,  that he cannot be restrained from crime or from protecting and  harboring criminals, he shall be led out of his native district  with his wife and children, and all his goods, to any part of the  kingdom which the King chooses, be he noble or commoner, whoever  he may be - with the provision that he shall never return to his  native district. And henceforth, let him never be encountered by  anyone in that district; otherwise he shall be treated as a thief  caught in the act.\"    This lawsuit between a son and his mother over land was heard at a  shire-meeting: \"Here it is declared in this document that a shire-  meeting sat at Aylton in King Cnut's time. There were present  Bishop AEthelstan and Earl Ranig and Edwin, the Earl's son, and  Leofwine, Wulfsige's son, and Thurkil the White; and Tofi the  Proud came there on the King's business, and Bryning the sheriff  was present, and AEthelweard of Frome and Leofwine of Frome and  Godric of Stoke and all the thegns of Herefordshire. Then Edwin,  Enneawnes son, came traveling to the meeting and sued his own  mother for a certain piece of land, namely Wellington and Cradley.  Then the bishop asked whose business it was to answer for his  mother, and Thurkil the White replied that it was his business to  do so, if he knew the claim. As he did not know the claim, three  thegns were chosen from the meeting [to ride] to the place where  she was, namely at Fawley, and these were Leofwine of Frome and  AEthelsige the Red and Winsige the seaman, and when they came to  her they asked her what claim she had to the lands for which her  son was suing her. Then she said that she had no land that in any  way belonged to him, and was strongly incensed against her son,  and summoned to her kinswoman, Leofflaed, Thurkil's wife, and in  front of them said to her as follows: 'Here sits Leofflaed, my  kinswoman, to whom, after my death, I grant my land and my gold,  my clothing and my raiment and all that I possess.' And then she  said to the thegns: 'Act like thegns, and duly announce my message  to the meeting before all the worthy men, and tell them to whom I  have granted my land and all my property, and not a thing to my  own son, and ask them to be witnesses of this.' And they did so;  they rode to the meeting and informed all the worthy men of the  charge that she had laid upon them. Then Thurkil the White stood  up in the meeting and asked all the thegns to give his wife the  lands unreservedly which her kinswoman had granted her, and they  did so. Then Thurkil rode to St. AEthelbert's minister, with the  consent and cognizance of the whole assembly, and had it recorded  in a gospel book.\"    Courts controlled by lords of large private estates had various  kinds of jurisdiction recognized by the King: sac and soke  [possession of legal powers of execution and profits of justice  held by a noble or institution over inhabitants and tenants of the  estate, exercised through a private court], toll [right to collect  a payment on the sale of cattle and property] and team [right to  hold a court to determine the honesty of a man accused of illegal  possession of cattle], infangenetheof [the authority to judge and  to hang and take the chattels of a thief caught on the property],  and utfangenetheof [the authority to judge and to hand and take  the chattels of a thief dwelling out of his liberty, and  committing theft without the same, if he were caught within the  lord's property]. Some lords were even given jurisdiction over  breach of the royal peace, ambush and treacherous manslaughter,  harboring of outlaws, forced entry into a residence, and failure  to answer a military summons. Often this court's jurisdiction  overlapped that of the hundred court and sometimes a whole hundred  had passed under the jurisdiction of an abbot, bishop, or earl.    A lord and his noble lady, or his steward, presided at this court.  The law was administered here on the same principles as at the  hundred court. Judges of the leet of the court of a large private  estate were chosen from the constables and four representatives  selected from each community, village, or town.    Before a dispute went to the hundred court, it might be taken care  of by the head tithing man, e;.g. cases between vills, between  neighbors, and some compensations and settlements, namely  concerning pastures, meadows, harvests, and contests between  neighbors.    The vill [similar to village] was the smallest community for  judicial purposes. There were several vills in a hundred.    In London, the Hustings Court met weekly and decided such issues  as wills and bequests and commerce matters. The folk-mote of all  citizens met three times a year. Each ward had a leet court [for  minor criminal matters].    The king and his witan decided the complaints and issues of the  nobility and those cases which had not received justice in the  hundred or shire court. The witan had a criminal jurisdiction and  could imprison or outlaw a person. The witan could even compel the  king to return any land he might have unjustly taken. Specially  punishable by the king was \"oferhyrnesse\": contempt of the king's  law. It covered refusal of justice, neglect of summons to gemot or  pursuit of thieves, disobedience to the king's offiers, sounding  the king's coin, accepting another man's dependent without his  leave, buying outside markets, and refusing to pay Peter's pence.    The forests were peculiarly subject to the absolute will of the  king. They were outside the common law. Their unique customs and  laws protected the peace of the animals rather than the king's  subjects. Only special officials on special commissions heard  their cases.    The form of oaths for compurgation were specified for theft of  cattle, unsoundness of property bought, and money owed for a sale.  The defendant denied the accusation by sweating that \"By the Lord,  I am guiltless, both in deed and counsel, and of the charge of  which ... accuses me.\" A compurgator swore that \"By the Lord, the  oath is clean and unperjured which ... has sworn.\". A witness swore  that \"In the name of Almighty God, as I here for ... in true witness  stand, unbidden and unbought, so I with my eyes over-saw, and with  my ears over-heard, that which I with him say.\"    If a theow man was guilty at the ordeal, he was not only to give  compensation, but was to be scourged thrice, or a second geld be  given; and be the wite of half value for theows.                                     - - - Chapter 4 - - -                                - The Times: 1066-1100 -    William came from Normandy to conquer England. He claimed that the  former King, Edward, the Confessor, had promised the throne to him  when they were growing up together in Normandy, if Edward became  King of England and had no children. The Conquerer's men and  horses came in boats powered by oars and sails. The conquest did  not take long because of the superiority of his military expertise  to that of the English. He organized his army into three groups:  archers with bows and arrows, horsemen with swords and stirrups,  and footmen with hand weapons. Each group played a specific role  in a strategy planned in advance. The English army was only  composed of footmen with hand weapons such as spears and shields.  They fought in a line holding up their shields to overlap each  other ane form a shieldwall. The defeat of the English was thought  to have been presaged by a comet.
