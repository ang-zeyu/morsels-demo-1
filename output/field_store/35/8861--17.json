He insinuated, that a change  so great must have been prompted by motives of a singular and momentous  kind.    No answer, or an answer wide of the purpose, was generally made to these  insinuations. Britons and Spaniards, he said, are votaries of the same  Deity, and square their faith by the same precepts; their ideas are  drawn from the same fountains of literature, and they speak dialects of  the same tongue; their government and laws have more resemblances than  differences; they were formerly provinces of the same civil, and till  lately, of the same religious, Empire.    As to the motives which induce men to change the place of their abode,  these must unavoidably be fleeting and mutable. If not bound to one spot  by conjugal or parental ties, or by the nature of that employment to  which we are indebted for subsistence, the inducements to change are far  more numerous and powerful, than opposite inducements.    He spoke as if desirous of shewing that he was not aware of the tendency  of Pleyel's remarks; yet, certain tokens were apparent, that proved him  by no means wanting in penetration. These tokens were to be read in his  countenance, and not in his words. When any thing was said, indicating  curiosity in us, the gloom of his countenance was deepened, his eyes  sunk to the ground, and his wonted air was not resumed without visible  struggle. Hence, it was obvious to infer, that some incidents of  his life were reflected on by him with regret; and that, since these  incidents were carefully concealed, and even that regret which flowed  from them laboriously stifled, they had not been merely disastrous. The  secrecy that was observed appeared not designed to provoke or baffle the  inquisitive, but was prompted by the shame, or by the prudence of guilt.    These ideas, which were adopted by Pleyel and my brother, as well as  myself, hindered us from employing more direct means for accomplishing  our wishes. Questions might have been put in such terms, that no room  should be left for the pretence of misapprehension, and if modesty  merely had been the obstacle, such questions would not have been  wanting; but we considered, that, if the disclosure were productive of  pain or disgrace, it was inhuman to extort it.    Amidst the various topics that were discussed in his presence, allusions  were, of course, made to the inexplicable events that had lately  happened. At those times, the words and looks of this man were objects  of my particular attention. The subject was extraordinary; and any  one whose experience or reflections could throw any light upon it, was  entitled to my gratitude. As this man was enlightened by reading and  travel, I listened with eagerness to the remarks which he should make.    At first, I entertained a kind of apprehension, that the tale would be  heard by him with incredulity and secret ridicule. I had formerly heard  stories that resembled this in some of their mysterious circumstances,  but they were, commonly, heard by me with contempt. I was doubtful,  whether the same impression would not now be made on the mind of our  guest; but I was mistaken in my fears.    He heard them with seriousness, and without any marks either of  surprize or incredulity. He pursued, with visible pleasure, that kind  of disquisition which was naturally suggested by them. His fancy was  eminently vigorous and prolific, and if he did not persuade us, that  human beings are, sometimes, admitted to a sensible intercourse with the  author of nature, he, at least, won over our inclination to the cause.  He merely deduced, from his own reasonings, that such intercourse  was probable; but confessed that, though he was acquainted with many  instances somewhat similar to those which had been related by us, none  of them were perfectly exempted from the suspicion of human agency.    On being requested to relate these instances, he amused us with many  curious details. His narratives were constructed with so much skill,  and rehearsed with so much energy, that all the effects of a dramatic  exhibition were frequently produced by them. Those that were most  coherent and most minute, and, of consequence, least entitled to credit,  were yet rendered probable by the exquisite art of this rhetorician. For  every difficulty that was suggested, a ready and plausible solution  was furnished. Mysterious voices had always a share in producing  the catastrophe, but they were always to be explained on some known  principles, either as reflected into a focus, or communicated through  a tube. I could not but remark that his narratives, however complex or  marvellous, contained no instance sufficiently parallel to those that  had befallen ourselves, and in which the solution was applicable to our  own case.    My brother was a much more sanguine reasoner than our guest. Even  in some of the facts which were related by Carwin, he maintained the  probability of celestial interference, when the latter was disposed to  deny it, and had found, as he imagined, footsteps of an human agent.  Pleyel was by no means equally credulous. He scrupled not to deny faith  to any testimony but that of his senses, and allowed the facts which had  lately been supported by this testimony, not to mould his belief, but  merely to give birth to doubts.    It was soon observed that Carwin adopted, in some degree, a similar  distinction. A tale of this kind, related by others, he would believe,  provided it was explicable upon known principles; but that such notices  were actually communicated by beings of an higher order, he would  believe only when his own ears were assailed in a manner which could not  be otherwise accounted for. Civility forbad him to contradict my brother  or myself, but his understanding refused to acquiesce in our testimony.  Besides, he was disposed to question whether the voices heard in the  temple, at the foot of the hill, and in my closet, were not really  uttered by human organs. On this supposition he was desired to explain  how the effect was produced.    He answered, that the power of mimickry was very common. Catharine's  voice might easily be imitated by one at the foot of the hill, who would  find no difficulty in eluding, by flight, the search of Wieland. The  tidings of the death of the Saxon lady were uttered by one near at hand,  who overheard the conversation, who conjectured her death, and whose  conjecture happened to accord with the truth. That the voice appeared to  come from the cieling was to be considered as an illusion of the fancy.  The cry for help, heard in the hall on the night of my adventure, was to  be ascribed to an human creature, who actually stood in the hall when he  uttered it. It was of no moment, he said, that we could not explain by  what motives he that made the signal was led hither. How imperfectly  acquainted were we with the condition and designs of the beings that  surrounded us? The city was near at hand, and thousands might there  exist whose powers and purposes might easily explain whatever was  mysterious in this transaction. As to the closet dialogue, he was  obliged to adopt one of two suppositions, and affirm either that it was  fashioned in my own fancy, or that it actually took place between two  persons in the closet.    Such was Carwin's mode of explaining these appearances. It is such,  perhaps, as would commend itself as most plausible to the most sagacious  minds, but it was insufficient to impart conviction to us. As to the  treason that was meditated against me, it was doubtless just to conclude  that it was either real or imaginary; but that it was real was attested  by the mysterious warning in the summer-house, the secret of which I had  hitherto locked up in my own breast.    A month passed away in this kind of intercourse. As to Carwin, our  ignorance was in no degree enlightened respecting his genuine character  and views. Appearances were uniform. No man possessed a larger store of  knowledge, or a greater degree of skill in the communication of it to  others; Hence he was regarded as an inestimable addition to our society.  Considering the distance of my brother's house from the city, he was  frequently prevailed upon to pass the night where he spent the evening.  Two days seldom elapsed without a visit from him; hence he was regarded  as a kind of inmate of the house. He entered and departed without  ceremony. When he arrived he received an unaffected welcome, and when he  chose to retire, no importunities were used to induce him to remain.    The temple was the principal scene of our social enjoyments; yet the  felicity that we tasted when assembled in this asylum, was but the  gleam of a former sun-shine. Carwin never parted with his gravity.  The inscrutableness of his character, and the uncertainty whether his  fellowship tended to good or to evil, were seldom absent from our minds.  This circumstance powerfully contributed to sadden us.    My heart was the seat of growing disquietudes. This change in one who  had formerly been characterized by all the exuberances of soul, could  not fail to be remarked by my friends. My brother was always a pattern  of solemnity. My sister was clay, moulded by the circumstances in which  she happened to be placed. There was but one whose deportment remains  to be described as being of importance to our happiness. Had Pleyel  likewise dismissed his vivacity?    He was as whimsical and jestful as ever, but he was not happy. The  truth, in this respect, was of too much importance to me not to make me  a vigilant observer. His mirth was easily perceived to be the fruit  of exertion. When his thoughts wandered from the company, an air of  dissatisfaction and impatience stole across his features. Even the  punctuality and frequency of his visits were somewhat lessened. It may  be supposed that my own uneasiness"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7937"],[0,"Journal of an African Cruiser (#15)"],[1," was (a chief known to have taken a leading part in the affray), he  at first professed ignorance, but, on being hard pressed, offered to go  and seek him. He was informed, however, that he could not be permitted to  retire, but must produce Nippoo on the spot, or be taken to America.    The council went on. The depositions of three colonists were taken, and  the facts in the case brought out. They were substantially in accordance  with the narrative already given in this Journal; and, upon full  investigation, Captain Burke was decided to have been the aggressor. The  proceedings of the Fishmen had been fierce and savage, but were redeemed  by a quality of wild justice, and exhibited them altogether in a better  light than the white men.    This affair being adjusted, the business of the palaver might be  considered at an end, so far as the American squadron had any immediate  connection with it. But there were points of importance to be settled,  between the natives and the colonists. It was the interest of the latter,  that the Fishmen, residing in the neighborhood of the settlement, should  be ejected from their land, which would certainly be a very desirable  acquisition to the emigrants. It seems, that the land originally belonged  to the Sinoe tribe, whose head-quarters are four miles inland. Several  years ago, long before the arrival of the emigrants, this tribe gave  permission to a horde of Fishmen to occupy the site, but apparently  without relinquishing their own property in the soil. Feeble at first, the  tenants wore a friendly demeanor towards their landlords, and made  themselves useful, until, gradually acquiring strength, they became  insolent, and assumed an attitude of independence. Setting the interior  tribe, of whom they held the land, at defiance, these Fishmen put an  interdict upon their trading with foreigners, except through their own  agency. Eight or ten years ago, however, the inland natives sold the land  to the Colonization Society, subject to the incumbrance of the Fishmen's  occupancy, during good behavior; a condition which the colonists likewise  pledged themselves to the Fishmen to observe, unless the conduct of the  latter should nullify it.    For the last two or three years, the settlement at Sinoe, being neglected  by the Mississippi Society, under whose patronage it was established, has  dwindled and grown weaker in numbers and spirit. The Fishmen, with their  characteristic audacity, have assumed a bolder aspect, and, besides  committing many depredations on the property of the colonists, have  murdered two or three of their number. The murderers, it is true, were  delivered up by the tribe, and punished at the discretion of the Monrovian  authorities; but the colonists at Sinoe felt themselves too feeble to  redress their lighter wrongs, and therefore refrained from demanding  satisfaction. About a month since, an addition of sixty new emigrants was  made to the seventy, already established there. Considering themselves now  adequate to act on the offensive, they determined to drive off the  Fishmen. In this purpose they were confirmed by the Monrovian government;  and it was a part of the governor's business, at the palaver, to provide  for its execution.    Governor Roberts exhibited much sagacity and diplomatic shrewdness in  accomplishing his object. It was obviously important to obtain the  assistance of the Bushmen, in expelling and keeping away the Fishmen.  They, however, were unwilling to take part in the matter, alleging their  fears as an excuse; although it might probably be a stronger reason, that  they could trade more advantageously with merchant-vessels, through the  medium of the Fishmen, than by the agency of the colonists.    But the interposition of the American Commodore, and the affair of the  murder, afforded the Governor the advantage of mixing up that question  with the colonial one; so as to give the natives the impression that  everything was done at the instance and under the authority of our armed  force. This vantage-ground he skilfully made use of, yet not without its  being perceived, by the native politicians, that the question of expelling  the Fishmen was essentially distinct from that of the murder of Captain  Burke's seamen. Davis the interpreter, and one of the headmen of the Sinoe  tribe, inquired why the Commodore did not first talk his palaver, and then  the Governor in turn talk his. It did not suit his excellency's views to  answer; and the question was evaded. By this ingenious policy, the Bushmen  were induced to promise their aid in ridding the settlement of its  troublesome neighbors; while the Fishmen, overawed by the presence of a  force friendly to the colonists, submitted to their expulsion with a  quietude that could not, under other circumstances, have been expected.  Doubtless, they had forfeited their claim to the land by non-observance of  the conditions on which they held it; yet, in some points, the affair had  remarkably the aspect of a forcible acquisition of territory by the  colonists.    No time was lost in carrying the decree of the palaver into execution.  Apprehending hostilities from the squadron, the Fishmen had already  removed most of their property, as well as their women and children, and  had evacuated the town. Governor Roberts, Mr. Brown, Doctor Day, late  government agent, together with a few colonists, repaired to the place and  directed its demolition. This was partially effected by the natives, of  whom some hundreds from the interior were present. They cut down and  unroofed many of the dwellings; and the Governor left directions to burn  every house, if the Fishmen should attempt to re-occupy the town. This  wild horde, therefore, may be considered as permanently ejected from the  ground which they held on so singular a tenure; and thus terminated an  affair which throws a strong light on many of the characteristics of the  natives, and likewise on the relations between them and the emigrants.    _December_ 3.--We sailed, at two o'clock A.M., for Settra Kroo, fifteen  miles down the coast. Anchored at eleven A.M. A boat being sent ashore,  brought news of the death of Mr. Sawyer, the missionary. He left a wife,  now the only white person at the place.    4.--The boats landed at Settra Kroo, to settle a palaver. The matter in  question was the violence offered by the natives to Captain Brown, master  of an American vessel, in striking and attempting to kill him. They  admitted the fact, begged pardon, and agreed to pay ten bullocks, four  sheep, and some fowls, or the value thereof, to Captain Brown, and further  to permit him to trade without payment of the usual \"dash.\" This town is  said to be very superior to any other native settlement on the coast; and  the people are the best informed, most intelligent, and the finest in  personal appearance, that we have met with.    Dined on shore. Mrs. Sawyer presided at the table, although her husband  was buried only yesterday. It is impossible not to look with admiration at  this lady, whose husband and only child have fallen victims to the  climate, yet who believes it her duty to remain alone, upon a barbarous  coast, in a position which perhaps no other woman ever voluntarily  occupied. She is faithful to her trust, as the companion of him who fell  at his post, and is doubtless happy in obedience to the unworldly motives  that guide her determination. Yet I cannot reconcile myself to the idea of  a woman sharing the martyrdom, which seems a proper, and not an  undesirable fate (so it come in the line of his duty) for a man. I doubt  the expediency of sending missionary ladies to perish here. Indeed, it may  well be questioned whether a missionary ought, in any country, to be a  married man. The care of a family must distract his attention and weaken  his efficiency; and herein, it may be, consists one great advantage which  the Catholic missionary possesses over the Protestant. He can penetrate  into the interior; he can sleep in the hut, and eat the simple food of a  native. But, if there be a wife and children, they must have houses and a  thousand other comforts, which are not only expensive and difficult to  obtain, but are clogs to keep the missionary down to one spot. I know how  much the toil and suffering of man is alleviated, in these far-off  regions, by the tenderness of woman. But the missionary is, by his  profession, a devoted man; he seeks, in this life, not his own happiness,  but the eternal good of others. Compare him with the members of my own  profession. We are sustained by no such lofty faith as must be supposed to  animate him, yet we find it possible to spend years upon the barren deep,  exposed to every variety of climate, and seeking peril wherever it may be  found--and all without the aid of woman's ministrations. Can a man, vowed  to the service of a Divine Master, think it much to practise similar  self-denial?    5.--This morning, while performing my ablutions with a large sponge, a  centipede, four and a half inches long, crawled out of one of the  orifices, and, ran over my hand. The venomous reptile was killed, without  any harm being done. It had probably been hidden in one of a number of  large land-shells, which I brought on board a day or two ago. His touch  upon my hand was the most disagreeable sensation that I have yet  experienced in Africa.    For a month past it has rained almost every night, but only three or four  times during the day. The tornadoes have not troubled us, and the regular  land and sea-breezes prevail.    6.--At 4 P. M., anchored off Cape Palmas. The Decatur had hardly clewed up  her top-sails, when she was directed by signal to make sail again. Shortly  afterwards, a boat from the frigate brought us intelligence that there is  trouble here between the natives and the colonists. The boats are ordered  to be in readiness to go ashore to-morrow, in order to settle a palaver."]]]
