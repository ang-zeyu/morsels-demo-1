[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5946"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 2, Complete (#15)"],[1,"--when Don Quixote and  Sancho quitted the wood and entered El Toboso. The town was in deep  silence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the broad  of their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, though Sancho  would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in the  darkness an excuse for his blundering. All over the place nothing was to  be heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears of Don  Quixote and troubled the heart of Sancho. Now and then an ass brayed,  pigs grunted, cats mewed, and the various noises they made seemed louder  in the silence of the night; all which the enamoured knight took to be of  evil omen; nevertheless he said to Sancho, \"Sancho, my son, lead on to  the palace of Dulcinea, it may be that we shall find her awake.\"    \"Body of the sun! what palace am I to lead to,\" said Sancho, \"when what I  saw her highness in was only a very little house?\"    \"Most likely she had then withdrawn into some small apartment of her  palace,\" said Don Quixote, \"to amuse herself with damsels, as great  ladies and princesses are accustomed to do.\"    \"Senor,\" said Sancho, \"if your worship will have it in spite of me that  the house of my lady Dulcinea is a palace, is this an hour, think you, to  find the door open; and will it be right for us to go knocking till they  hear us and open the door; making a disturbance and confusion all through  the household? Are we going, do you fancy, to the house of our wenches,  like gallants who come and knock and go in at any hour, however late it  may be?\"    \"Let us first of all find out the palace for certain,\" replied Don  Quixote, \"and then I will tell thee, Sancho, what we had best do; but  look, Sancho, for either I see badly, or that dark mass that one sees  from here should be Dulcinea's palace.\"    \"Then let your worship lead the way,\" said Sancho, \"perhaps it may be so;  though I see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands, I'll believe it  as much as I believe it is daylight now.\"    Don Quixote took the lead, and having gone a matter of two hundred paces  he came upon the mass that produced the shade, and found it was a great  tower, and then he perceived that the building in question was no palace,  but the chief church of the town, and said he, \"It's the church we have  lit upon, Sancho.\"    \"So I see,\" said Sancho, \"and God grant we may not light upon our graves;  it is no good sign to find oneself wandering in a graveyard at this time  of night; and that, after my telling your worship, if I don't mistake,  that the house of this lady will be in an alley without an outlet.\"    \"The curse of God on thee for a blockhead!\" said Don Quixote; \"where hast  thou ever heard of castles and royal palaces being built in alleys  without an outlet?\"    \"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"every country has a way of its own; perhaps  here in El Toboso it is the way to build palaces and grand buildings in  alleys; so I entreat your worship to let me search about among these  streets or alleys before me, and perhaps, in some corner or other, I may  stumble on this palace--and I wish I saw the dogs eating it for leading  us such a dance.\"    \"Speak respectfully of what belongs to my lady, Sancho,\" said Don  Quixote; \"let us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope after  the bucket.\"    \"I'll hold my tongue,\" said Sancho, \"but how am I to take it patiently  when your worship wants me, with only once seeing the house of our  mistress, to know always, and find it in the middle of the night, when  your worship can't find it, who must have seen it thousands of times?\"    \"Thou wilt drive me to desperation, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote. \"Look  here, heretic, have I not told thee a thousand times that I have never  once in my life seen the peerless Dulcinea or crossed the threshold of  her palace, and that I am enamoured solely by hearsay and by the great  reputation she bears for beauty and discretion?\"    \"I hear it now,\" returned Sancho; \"and I may tell you that if you have  not seen her, no more have I.\"    \"That cannot be,\" said Don Quixote, \"for, at any rate, thou saidst, on  bringing back the answer to the letter I sent by thee, that thou sawest  her sifting wheat.\"    \"Don't mind that, senor,\" said Sancho; \"I must tell you that my seeing  her and the answer I brought you back were by hearsay too, for I can no  more tell who the lady Dulcinea is than I can hit the sky.\"    \"Sancho, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"there are times for jests and times  when jests are out of place; if I tell thee that I have neither seen nor  spoken to the lady of my heart, it is no reason why thou shouldst say  thou hast not spoken to her or seen her, when the contrary is the case,  as thou well knowest.\"    While the two were engaged in this conversation, they perceived some one  with a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood, and from the  noise the plough made, as it dragged along the ground, they guessed him  to be some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to his work, and  so it proved to be. He came along singing the ballad that says--    Ill did ye fare, ye men of France, In Roncesvalles chase--    \"May I die, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, when he heard him, \"if any good  will come to us to-night! Dost thou not hear what that clown is singing?\"    \"I do,\" said Sancho, \"but what has Roncesvalles chase to do with what we  have in hand? He might just as well be singing the ballad of Calainos,  for any good or ill that can come to us in our business.\"    By this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him, \"Can  you tell me, worthy friend, and God speed you, whereabouts here is the  palace of the peerless princess Dona Dulcinea del Toboso?\"    \"Senor,\" replied the lad, \"I am a stranger, and I have been only a few  days in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. In that house  opposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan, and both  or either of them will be able to give your worship some account of this  lady princess, for they have a list of all the people of El Toboso;  though it is my belief there is not a princess living in the whole of it;  many ladies there are, of quality, and in her own house each of them may  be a princess.\"    \"Well, then, she I am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,\"  said Don Quixote.    \"May be so,\" replied the lad; \"God be with you, for here comes the  daylight;\" and without waiting for any more of his questions, he whipped  on his mules.    Sancho, seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied, said to  him, \"Senor, daylight will be here before long, and it will not do for us  to let the sun find us in the street; it will be better for us to quit  the city, and for your worship to hide in some forest in the  neighbourhood, and I will come back in the daytime, and I won't leave a  nook or corner of the whole village that I won't search for the house,  castle, or palace, of my lady, and it will be hard luck for me if I don't  find it; and as soon as I have found it I will speak to her grace, and  tell her where and how your worship is waiting for her to arrange some  plan for you to see her without any damage to her honour and reputation.\"    \"Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou hast delivered a thousand sentences  condensed in the compass of a few words; I thank thee for the advice thou  hast given me, and take it most gladly. Come, my son, let us go look for  some place where I may hide, while thou dost return, as thou sayest, to  seek, and speak with my lady, from whose discretion and courtesy I look  for favours more than miraculous.\"    Sancho was in a fever to get his master out of the town, lest he should  discover the falsehood of the reply he had brought to him in the Sierra  Morena on behalf of Dulcinea; so he hastened their departure, which they  took at once, and two miles out of the village they found a forest or  thicket wherein Don Quixote ensconced himself, while Sancho returned to  the city to speak to Dulcinea, in which embassy things befell him which  demand fresh attention and a new chapter.          CHAPTER X.    WHEREIN IS RELATED THE CRAFTY DEVICE SANCHO ADOPTED TO ENCHANT THE LADY  DULCINEA, AND OTHER INCIDENTS AS LUDICROUS AS THEY ARE TRUE      When the author of this great history comes to relate what is set down in  this chapter he says he would have preferred to pass it over in silence,  fearing it would not be believed, because here Don Quixote's madness  reaches the confines of the greatest that can be conceived, and even goes  a couple of bowshots beyond the greatest. But after all, though still  under the same fear and apprehension, he has recorded it without adding  to the story or leaving out a particle of the truth, and entirely  disregarding the charges of falsehood that might be brought against him;  and he was right, for the truth may run fine but will not break, and  always rises above falsehood as oil above water; and so, going on with  his story, he says that as soon as Don Quixote had ensconced himself in  the forest, oak grove, or wood near El Toboso, he bade Sancho return to  the city, and not come into his presence again without having first  spoken on his behalf to his lady, and begged of her that it might be her  good pleasure to permit herself to be seen by her enslaved knight, and  deign to bestow her blessing upon him, so that he might thereby hope for  a happy issue in all his encounters and difficult enterprises. Sancho  undertook to execute the task according to the instructions, and to bring  back an answer as good as the one he brought back before.    \"Go, my son,\" said Don Quixote, \"and be not dazed when thou findest  thyself exposed to the light of that sun of beauty thou art going to  seek. Happy thou, above all the squires in the world! Bear in mind, and  let it not escape thy memory, how she receives thee; if she changes  colour while thou art giving her my message; if she is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/597"],[0,"The Story of Burnt Njal: The Great Icelandic Tribune, Jurist, and Counsellor (#15)"],[1,"smoke right up to him, but he was  eager at his work, and saw him not.  Brynjolf gave him a stroke  on the head with his axe, and he turned so quick round that  Brynjolf loosed his hold of the axe, and Atli grasped the spear,  and hurled it after him.  Then Brynjolf cast himself down on the  ground, but the spear flew away over him.    \"Lucky for thee that I was not ready for thee,\" says Atli, \"but  now Hallgerda will be well pleased, for thou wilt tell her of my  death; but it is a comfort to know that thou wilt have the same  fate soon; but come now take thy axe which has been here.\"    He answered him never a word, nor did he take the axe before he  was dead.  Then he rode up to the house on Thorolfsfell, and told  of the slaying, and after that rode home and told Hallgerda.  She  sent men to Bergthorsknoll, and let them tell Bergthora that now  Kol's slaying was paid for.    After that Hallgerda sent a man to the Thing to tell Gunnar of  Atli's killing.    Gunnar stood up, and Kolskegg with him, and Kolskegg said,  \"Unthrifty will Hallgerda's kinsmen be to thee.\"    Then they go to see Njal, and Gunnar said, \"I have to tell thee  of Atli's killing.\"  He told him also who slew him, and went on,  \"And now I will bid thee atonement for the deed, and thou shalt  make the award thyself.\"    Njal said, \"We two have always meant never to come to strife  about anything; but still I cannot make him out a thrall.\"    Gunnar said that was all right, and stretched out his hand.    Njal named his witnesses, and they made peace on those terms.    Skarphedinn said, \"Hallgerda does not let our housecarles die  of old age.\"    Gunnar said, \"Thy mother will take care that blow goes for blow  between the houses.\"    \"Ay, ay,\" says Njal, \"there will be enough of that work.\"    After that Njal fixed the price at a hundred in silver, but  Gunnar paid it down at once.  Many who stood by said that the  award was high; Gunnar got wroth, and said that a full atonement  was often paid for those who were no brisker men than Atli.    With that they rode home from the Thing.    Bergthora said to Njal when she saw the money, \"Thou thinkest  thou hast fulfilled thy promise, but now my promise is still  behind.\"    \"There is no need that thou shouldst fulfil it,\" says Njal.    \"Nay,\" says she, \"thou hast guessed it would be so; and so it  shall be.\"    Hallgerda said to Gunnar, \"Hast thou paid a hundred in silver for  Atli's slaying, and made him a free man?\"    \"He was free before,\" says Gunnar, \"and besides, I will not make  Njal's household outlaws who have forfeited their rights.\"    \"There's not a pin to choose between you,\" she said, \"for both of  you are so blate?\"    \"That's as things prove,\" says he.    Then Gunnar was for a long time very short with her, till she  gave way to him; and now all was still for the rest of that year;  in the spring Njal did not increase his household, and now men  ride to the Thing about summer.        39. THE SLAYING OF BRYNJOLF THE UNRULY    There was a man named Thord, he was surnamed Freedmanson.  Sigtrygg was his father's name, and he had been the freedman of  Asgerd, and he was drowned in Markfleet.  That was why Thord was  with Njal afterwards.  He was a tall man and a strong, and he had  fostered all Njal's sons.  He had set his heart on Gudfinna  Thorolf's daughter, Njal's kinswoman; she was housekeeper at home  there, and was then with child.    Now Bergthora came to talk with Thord Freedmanson; she said,  \"Thou shalt go to kill Brynjolf, Hallgerda's kinsman.\"    \"I am no man-slayer,\" he says, \"but still I will do whatever thou  wilt.\"    \"This is my will,\" she says.    After that he went up to Lithend, and made them call Hallgerda  out, and asked where Brynjolf might be.    \"What's thy will with him,\" she says.    \"I want him to tell me where he has hidden Atli's body; I have  heard say that he has buried it badly.\"    She pointed to him and said he was down yonder in Acretongue.    \"Take heed,\" says Thord, \"that the same thing does not befall him  as befell Atli.\"    \"Thou art no man-slayer,\" she says, \"and so naught will come of  it even if ye two do meet.\"    \"Never have I seen man's blood, nor do I know how I should feel  if I did,\" he says, and gallops out of the \"town\" and down to  Acretongue.    Rannveig, Gunnar's mother, had heard their talk.    \"Thou goadest his mind much, Hallgerda,\" she says, \"but I think  him a dauntless man, and that thy kinsman will find.\"    They met on the beaten way, Thord and Brynjolf; and Thord said,  \"Guard thee, Brynjolf, for I will do no dastard's deed by thee.\"    Brynjolf rode at Thord, and smote at him with his axe.  He smote  at him at the same time with his axe, and hewed in sunder the  haft just above Brynjolf's hands, and then hewed at him at once a  second time, and struck him on the collar-bone, and the blow went  straight into his trunk.  Then he fell from horseback, and was  dead on the spot.    Thord met Hallgerda's herdsman, and gave out the slaying as done  by his hand, and said where he lay, and bade him tell Hallgerda  of the slaying.  After that he rode home to Bergthorsknoll, and  told Bergthora of the slaying, and other people too.    \"Good luck go with thy hands,\" she said.    The herdsman told Hallgerda of the slaying; she was snappish at  it, and said much ill would come of it, if she might have her  way.        40. GUNNAR AND NJAL MAKE PEACE ABOUT BRYNJOLF'S SLAYING    Now these tidings come to the Thing, and Njal made them tell him  the tale thrice, and then he said, \"More men now become man-  slayers than I weened.\"    Skarphedinn spoke, \"That man, though, must have been twice fey,\"  he says, \"who lost his life by our foster-father's hand, who has  never seen man's blood.  And many would think that we brothers  would sooner have done this deed with the turn of temper that we  have.\"    \"Scant space wilt thou have,\" says Njal, \"ere the like befalls  thee; but need will drive thee to it.\"    Then they went to meet Gunnar, and told him of the slaying.  Gunnar spoke and said that was little man-scathe, \"but yet he was  a free man.\"    Njal offered to make peace at once, and Gunnar said yes, and he  was to settle the terms himself.  He made his award there and  then, and laid it at one hundred in silver.  Njal paid down the  money on the spot, and they were at peace after that.        41. SIGMUND COMES OUT TO ICELAND    There was a man whose name was Sigmund.  He was the son of Lambi,  the son of Sighvat the Red.  He was a great voyager, and a comely  and a courteous man; tall too, and strong.  He was a man of proud  spirit, and a good skald, and well trained in most feats of  strength.  He was noisy and boisterous, and given to jibes and  mocking.  He made the land east in Homfirth.  Skiolld was the  name of his fellow-traveller; he was a Swedish man, and ill to do  with.  They took horse and rode from the east out of Hornfirth,  and did not draw bridle before they came to Lithend, in the  Fleetlithe.  Gunnar gave them a hearty welcome, for the bonds of  kinship were close between them.  Gunnar begged Sigmund to stay  there that winter, and Sigmund said he would take the offer if  Skiolld his fellow might be there too.    \"Well, I have been so told about him,\" said Gunnar, \"that he is  no betterer of thy temper; but as it is, thou rather needest to  have it bettered.  This, too, is a bad house to stay at, and I  would just give both of you a bit of advice, my kinsman, not to  fire up at the egging on of my wife Hallgerda; for she takes much  in hand that is far from my will.\"    \"His hands are clean who warns another,\" says Sigmund.    \"Then mind the advice given thee,\" says Gunnar, \"for thou art  sure to be sore tried; and go along always with me, and lean upon  my counsel.\"    After that they were in Gunnar's company.  Hallgerda was good to  Sigmund; and it soon came about that things grew so warm that she  loaded him with money, and tended him no worse than her own  husband; and many talked about that, and did not know what lay  under it.    One day Hallgerda said to Gunnar, \"It is not good to be content  with that hundred in silver which thou tookest for my kinsman  Brynjolf.  I shall avenge him if I may,\" she says.    Gunnar said he had no mind to bandy words with her, and went  away.  He met Kolskegg, and said to him, \"Go and see Njal; and  tell him that Thord must be ware of himself though peace has been  made for, methinks, there is faithlessness somewhere.\"    He rode off and told Njal, but Njal told Thord, and Kolskegg rode  home, and Njal thanked them for their faithfulness.    Once on a time they two were out in the \"town,\" Njal and Thord; a  he-goat was wont to go up and down in the \"town,\" and no one was  allowed to drive him away.  Then Thord spoke and said, \"Well,  this is a wondrous thing!\"    \"What is it that thou see'st that seems after a wondrous  fashion?\" says Njal.    \"Methinks the goat lies here in the hollow, and he is all one  gore of blood.\"    Njal said that there was no goat there, nor anything else.    \"What is it then?\" says Thord.    \"Thou must be a `fey' man,\" says Njal, \"and thou must have seen  the fetch that follows thee, and now be ware of thyself.\"    \"That will stand me in no stead,\" says Thord, \"if death is doomed  for me.\"    Then Hallgerda came to talk with Thrain Sigfus' son, and said, \"I  would think thee my son-in-law indeed,\" she says, \"if thou  slayest Thord Freedmanson.\"    \"I will not do that,\" he says, \"for then I shall have the wrath  of my kinsman Gunnar; and besides, great things hang on this  deed, for this slaying would soon be avenged.\"    \"Who will avenge it?\" she asks; \"is it the beardless carle?\"    \"Not so,\" says he, \"his sons will avenge it.\"    After that they talked long and low, and no man knew what counsel  they took together.    Once it happened that Gunnar was not at home, but those  companions were.  Thrain had come in from Gritwater, and then he  and they"]]]
