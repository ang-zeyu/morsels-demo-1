So far, therefore, as they were consistent with the  objects of the Jewish law, the customs of Palestine and the laws of  Egypt would doubtless be traceable in the Mosaic system.\" (Smith's  Bible Dictionary, p. 1602.)    3. _Basic Principle of the Law of Moses:_ \"The basis of human society  is ordinarily sought, by law or philosophy, either in the rights  of the individual, and the partial delegation of them to political  authorities; or in the mutual needs of men, and the relations which  spring from them; or in the actual existence of power of man over man,  whether arising from natural relationship, or from benefits conferred,  or from physical or intellectual ascendency. The maintenance of society  is supposed to depend on a \"social compact\" between governors and  subjects; a compact, true as an abstract idea, but untrue if supposed  to have been a historical reality. The Mosaic Law seeks the basis  of its polity, first, in the absolute sovereignty of God, next in  the relationship of each individual to God, and through God to his  countrymen. It is clear that such a doctrine, while it contradicts  none of the common theories, yet lies beneath them all, and shows  why each of them, being only a secondary deduction from an ultimate  truth, cannot be in itself sufficient; and, if it claims to be the  whole truth, will become an absurdity. It is the doctrine which is  insisted upon and developed in the whole series of prophecy; and which  is brought to its perfection only when applied to that universal and  spiritual kingdom for which the Mosaic system was a preparation.\"  (Smith's Bible Dictionary, p. 1607).    4. _Israel and the Law:_ \"It was indeed often neglected [the Law] and  even forgotten. Its fundamental assertion of the Theocracy was violated  by the natural course of human selfishness (Jer. xxxiv. 12-17); till  at last, in the reign of Josiah, its very existence was unknown, and  its discovery was to the king and the people as a second publication;  yet still it formed the standard from which they knowingly departed,  and to which they constantly returned; and to it, therefore, all which  was peculiar in their national and individual character was due. Its  direct influence was probably greatest in the periods before the  establishment of the kingdom, and after the Babylonish captivity. The  last act of Joshua was to bind the Israelites to it as the charter of  their occupation of the conquered land (Josh. xxiv. 24-27); and, in the  semi-anarchical period of the judges, the Law and the Tabernacle were  the only centers of anything like national unity. The establishment of  the kingdom was due to an impatience of this position, and a desire for  a visible and personal center of authority, much the same in nature as  that which plunged them so often in idolatry. The people were warned (I  Sam. xii. 6-25) that it involved much danger of their forgetting and  rejecting the main principle of the Law--that \"Jehovah their God was  their King.\" The truth of the prediction was soon shown. Even under  Solomon, as soon as the monarchy became one of great splendor and  power, it assumed a heathenish and polytheistic character, breaking the  Law, both by its dishonor towards God, and its forbidden tyranny over  man.\" (Smith's Bible Dictionary, p. 1609.)    5. _The Gospel and the Law:_ \"Abraham received the Priesthood from  Melchisedek, who received it through the lineage of his fathers, even  till Noah; * * * * This greater Priesthood administereth the gospel  and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of  the knowledge of God. Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power  of godliness is manifest; and without the ordinances thereof, and the  authority of the Priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest  unto men in the flesh; for without this no man can see the face of  God, even the Father, and live. Now this Moses plainly taught to the  children of Israel in the wilderness, and sought diligently to sanctify  his people that they might behold the face of God; but they hardened  their hearts and could not endure his presence, therefore the Lord in  his wrath (for his anger was kindled against them) swore that they  should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is  the fulness of his glory. Therefore he took Moses out of their midst,  and the Holy Priesthood also; and the lesser Priesthood continued,  which Priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of angels and the  preparatory gospel.\" (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 84.)    The above quotation from the 84th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants  throws much light, not only upon the Pentateuch, but upon the whole of  the Old Testament, the law of Moses, and the whole polity and history  of Israel. In the light of the truth the said quotation reveals, it is  to be seen that \"when the Lord took the children of Israel from the  land of Egypt to make of them a people for himself, he presented them  first with the gospel of Christ, with all its mercy and inspiring love  and gentleness; but they would not live in accordance with its high  moral precepts, nor reflect in their lives its spiritual excellence.  Accordingly, a less perfect law was given to Israel; a law which in  the New Testament is called \"the law of carnal commandments;\" a law  more in keeping with the status of their moral development; a law which  breathed less of mercy, forgiveness and love, and more of exacting,  relentless justice; demanding an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a  tooth--and this was to be their schoolmaster, to prepare them for the  more excellent law of the gospel of Christ. Many things in that law  of the Old Testament are confessedly imperfect, and must not be taken  as reflecting the full glory and excellence of the Divine wisdom or  goodness. On the contrary it is plainly stated, and that too by the  voice of inspiration in the New Testament, that it was a law carnal  and imperfect, and yet, withal, demanding a higher excellence than the  people of those days seemed able to attain.    In proof that the gospel was first offered to ancient Israel, and then  because of transgression the law of carnal commandments, I invite the  reader's attention to the following Scriptures: Heb., latter part of  chap. iii, in connection with Heb. iv: 1, 2; I Cor. x. 1-4; and Gal.  iii; also Doc. & Cov., sec. 84; see also the chapter on \"History of the  Gospel\" in The Gospel (Roberts), pp. 86, 87.    6. _The Song of Moses:_ \"This song is some hundred years the oldest  poem in the world. There is a sublimity and beauty in the language  that is unexampled. But its unrivalled superiority arises not solely  from the splendor of the diction. Its poetical excellencies have often  drawn forth the admiration of the best judges, while the character of  the event commemorated, and its being prompted by divine inspiration,  contribute to give to it an interest and sublimity peculiar to itself.\"  (Commentary, Explanatory and Critical, p. 59.)

The orang is distinctly an animal of more serene temper and more  philosophic mind than the chimpanzee. This has led some authors  erroneously to pronounce the orang an animal of morose and  sluggish disposition, and mentally inferior to the chimpanzee.  After a close personal acquaintance with about forty captive  orangs of various sizes, I am convinced that the facts do not  warrant that conclusion. The orang-utans of the New York  Zoological Park certainly have been as cheerful in disposition, as  fond of exercise and as fertile in droll performances as our  chimpanzees. Even though the mind of the chimpanzee does act more  quickly than that of its rival, and even though its movements are  usually more rapid and more precise, the mind of the orang carries  that animal precisely as far. Moreover, in its native jungles the  orang habitually builds for itself a very comfortable nest on  which to rest and sleep, which the chimpanzee ordinarily does not  do.    I think that the exact mental status of an anthropoid ape is best  revealed by an attempt to train it to do some particular thing, in  a manner that the trainer elects. Usually about five lessons,  carefully observed, will afford a good index of the pupil's mental  capabilities. Some chimpanzees are too nervous to be taught, some  are too obstinate, and others are too impatient of restraint. Some  orang-utans are hopelessly indifferent to the business in hand,  and refuse to become interested in it. I think that no orang is  too dull to learn to sit at a table, and eat with the utensils  that are usually considered sacred to man's use, but the majority  of them care only for the food, and take no interest in the  function. On the other hand, the average chimpanzee is as restless  as a newly-caught eel, and its mind is dominated by a desire to  climb far beyond the reach of restraining hands, and to do almost  anything save that which is particularly desired.    Among the twenty or more orangs which up to 1922 have been  exhibited in the Zoological Park, two stand out with special  prominence, by reason of their unusual mental qualities. They  differed widely from each other. One was a born actor and  imitator, who loved human partnership in his daily affairs. The  other was an original thinker and reasoner, with a genius for  invention, and at all times impatient of training and restraint.  The first was named Rajah, the latter was called Dohong.    Rajah was a male orang, and about four years of age when received  by us. His high and broad forehead, large eyes and general breadth  of cranium and jaw marked him at once as belonging to the higher  caste of orangs. Dealers and experts have no difficulty in  recognizing at one glance an orang that has a good brain and good  general physique from those which are thin-headed, narrow-jawed,  weak in body and unlikely to live long.    At the Zoological Park we have tested out the orang-utan's  susceptibility to training, and proven that the task is so simple  and easy that even amateurs can accomplish much in a short time.  Desiring that several of our orangs should perform in public, we  instructed the primate keepers to proceed along certain lines and  educate them to that idea. Naturally, the performance was laid out  to match our own possibilities. In a public park, where only a  very little time can be devoted to training, we do not linger long  over an animal that is either stupid or obstinate. Those which  cannot be trained easily and quickly are promptly set aside as  ineligible.    Without any great amount of labor, and with no real difficulty,  our orangs were trained to perform the following simple acts:    1. To sit at table, and eat and drink like humans. This involved  eating sliced bananas with a fork, pouring out milk from a teapot  into a teacup, drinking out of a teacup, drinking out of a beer-  bottle, using a toothpick, striking a match, lighting a cigarette,  smoking and spitting like a man.    2. To ride a tricycle, or bicycle.    3. To put on a pair of trousers, adjust the suspenders, put on a  sweater or coat, and a cap, reversing the whole operation after  the performance.    4. To drive nails with a hammer.    5. Use a key to lock and unlock a padlock. The animal most  proficient in this became able to select the right Yale key out of  a bunch of half a dozen or more, with as much quickness and  precision as the average man displays.    The orang Dohong learned to pedal and to guide a tricycle in about  three lessons. He caught the two ideas almost instantly, and soon  brought his muscles under control sufficiently to ride  successfully, even under difficult conditions.    It was quickly recognized that our Rajah was a particularly good  subject, and with him the keepers went farther than with the four  others. From the first moment, the training operations were to him  both interesting and agreeable. The animal enjoyed the work, and  he entered into it so heartily that in two weeks he was ready to  dine in public, somewhat after the manner of human beings.    A platform eight feet in height was erected in front of the  Reptile House, and upon it were placed a table, a high chair such  as small children use, and various dishes. To the platform a step-  ladder led upward from the ground. Every day at four o'clock lusty  Rajah was carried to the exhibition space, and set free upon the  ground. Forthwith the keepers proceeded to dress him in trousers,  vest, coat and cap. The moment the last button had been fastened  and the cap placed upon his head, he would promptly walk to the  ladder, climb up to the platform, and in the most business-like  way imaginable, seat himself in his chair at the table, all ready  to dine.    He used a napkin, ate his soup with a spoon, speared and conveyed  his sliced bananas with his fork, poured milk from a teapot into  his teacup, and drank from his cup with great enjoyment and  decorum. When he took a drink (of tea) from a suspicious-looking  black bottle, the audience always laughed. When he elevated the  empty bottle to one eye and looked far into it, they roared; and  when he finally took a toothpick and gravely placed it in his  mouth, his auditors were delighted. Several times during the  progress of each meal, Rajah would pause and benignly gaze down  upon the crowd, like a self-satisfied judge on his bench.    Not once did Rajah spoil this exhibition, which was continued  throughout an entire summer, nor commit any overt act of  impatience, indifference or meanness. The flighty, nervous temper  of the chimpanzee was delightfully absent. The most remarkable  feature of it all was his very evident enjoyment of his part of  the performance, and his sense of responsibility to us and to his  audiences.    Rajah easily and quickly learned to ride a tricycle, and guide it  himself. But for his untimely death, through a remarkable invasion  of a microscopic parasite (_Balentidium coli_) imported from  the Galapagos Islands by elephant tortoises, his mind would have  been developed much farther. Since his death, in 1902, we have had  other orang-utans that were successfully taught to dine, but none  of them entered into the business with the same hearty zest which  characterized Rajah, and made his performances so interesting.    We now come to a consideration of simian mental traits of very  different character. Another male orang, named Dohong, of the  same age and intellectual caste as Rajah, developed a faculty for  mechanics and invention which not only challenged our admiration,  but also created much work for our carpenters. He discovered, or  invented,  as you please, the lever as a mechanical force,--as fairly  and squarely as Archimedes discovered the principle of the screw.  Moreover, he delighted in the use of the new power thus acquired,  quite as much as the successful inventor usually does. At the same  time, two very bright chimpanzees of his own age, and with the  same opportunities, discovered nothing.    [Illustration caption: THUMB-PRINT OF AN ORANG-UTAN  A group of fourteen experts in the New York City Departement of  Criminal Records were unable to recognise this thumb print as  anything else than that of a man]    [Illustration caption: \"RAJAH,\" THE ACTOR ORANG-UTAN  In three lessons he learned to ride a tricycle]    Dohong was of a reflective turn of mind, and never was entirely  willing to learn the things that his keepers sought to teach him.  To him, dining at a table was tiresomely dull, and the donning of  fashionable clothing was a frivolous pastime, On the other hand,  the interior of his cage, and his gymnastic appliances of ropes,  trapeze and horizontal bars, all interested him greatly. Every  square inch of surface, and every piece of material in his  apartment, was carefully investigated, many times over.    When three years old he discovered his own strength, and at first  he used it good-naturedly to hector his cage-mate, a female  chimpanzee smaller than himself. That, however, was of trifling  interest. The day on which he made the discovery that he could  break the wooden one and one-half inch horizontal bars that were  held out from his cage walls on cast iron brackets, was for him a  great day. Before his discovery was noted by the keepers he had  joyfully destroyed two bars, and with a broken piece used as a  lever was attacking a third. These bars were promptly replaced by  larger bars, of harder wood, but screwed to the same cast-iron  brackets that had carried the first series.    For a time, the heavier bars endured; but in an evil moment the  ape swung his trapeze bar, of two-inch oak, far over to one side  of his cage, and applied the bar as a lever, inside of a  horizontal bar and from above. The new force was too much for the  cast-iron brackets, and one by one they gave way. Some were"]]]
