BURLEIGH.  Its perpetrator and its base contriver!    AUBESPINE.  Please you, my lord, to bring me to the queen,  That I may lay the warm congratulations  Of my imperial master at her feet.    BURLEIGH.  There is no need of this.    AUBESPINE (officiously).                My Lord of Burleigh,  I know my duty.    BURLEIGH.           Sir, your duty is  To quit, and that without delay, this kingdom.    AUBESPINE (stepping back with surprise).  What! How is this?    BURLEIGH.             The sacred character  Of an ambassador to-day protects you,  But not to-morrow.    AUBESPINE.            What's my crime?    BURLEIGH.                     Should I  Once name it, there were then no pardon for it.    AUBESPINE.  I hope, my lord, my charge's privilege----    BURLEIGH.  Screens not a traitor.    LEICESTER and KENT.              Traitor! How?    AUBESPINE.                      My Lord,  Consider well----    BURLEIGH.           Your passport was discovered  In the assassin's pocket.    KENT.                Righteous heaven!    AUBESPINE.  Sir, many passports are subscribed by me;  I cannot know the secret thoughts of men.    BURLEIGH.  He in your house confessed, and was absolved.    AUBESPINE.  My house is open----    BURLEIGH.            To our enemies.    AUBESPINE.  I claim a strict inquiry.    BURLEIGH.                Tremble at it.    AUBESPINE.  My monarch in my person is insulted,  He will annul the marriage contract.    BURLEIGH.                     That  My royal mistress has annulled already;  England will not unite herself with France.  My Lord of Kent, I give to you the charge  To see Count Aubespine embarked in safety.  The furious populace has stormed his palace,  Where a whole arsenal of arms was found;  Should he be found, they'll tear him limb from limb,  Conceal him till the fury is abated--  You answer for his life.    AUBESPINE.                I go--I leave  This kingdom where they sport with public treaties  And trample on the laws of nations. Yet  My monarch, be assured, will vent his rage  In direst vengeance!    BURLEIGH.             Let him seek it here.       [Exeunt KENT and AUBESPINE.        SCENE III.       LEICESTER, BURLEIGH.    LEICESTER.  And thus you loose yourself the knot of union  Which you officiously, uncalled for, bound!  You have deserved but little of your country,  My lord; this trouble was superfluous.    BURLEIGH.  My aim was good, though fate declared against it;  Happy is he who has so fair a conscience!    LEICESTER.  Well know we the mysterious mien of Burleigh  When he is on the hunt for deeds of treason.  Now you are in your element, my lord;  A monstrous outrage has been just committed,  And darkness veils as yet its perpetrators:  Now will a court of inquisition rise;  Each word, each look be weighed; men's very thoughts  Be summoned to the bar. You are, my lord,  The mighty man, the Atlas of the state,  All England's weight lies upon your shoulders.    BURLEIGH.  In you, my lord, I recognize my master;  For such a victory as your eloquence  Has gained I cannot boast.    LEICESTER.                What means your lordship?    BURLEIGH.  You were the man who knew, behind my back,  To lure the queen to Fotheringay Castle.    LEICESTER.  Behind your back! When did I fear to act  Before your face?    BURLEIGH.            You led her majesty?  Oh, no--you led her not--it was the queen  Who was so gracious as to lead you thither.    LEICESTER.  What mean you, my lord, by that?    BURLEIGH.                   The noble part  You forced the queen to play! The glorious triumph  Which you prepared for her! Too gracious princess!  So shamelessly, so wantonly to mock  Thy unsuspecting goodness, to betray thee  So pitiless to thy exulting foe!  This, then, is the magnanimity, the grace  Which suddenly possessed you in the council!  The Stuart is for this so despicable,  So weak an enemy, that it would scarce  Be worth the pains to stain us with her blood.  A specious plan! and sharply pointed too;  'Tis only pity this sharp point is broken.    LEICESTER.  Unworthy wretch! this instant follow me,  And answer at the throne this insolence.    BURLEIGH.  You'll find me there, my lord; and look you well  That there your eloquence desert you not.                       [Exit.        SCENE IV.       LEICESTER alone, then MORTIMER.    LEICESTER.  I am detected! All my plot's disclosed!  How has my evil genius tracked my steps!  Alas! if he has proofs, if she should learn  That I have held a secret correspondence  With her worst enemy; how criminal  Shall I appear to her! How false will then  My counsel seem, and all the fatal pains  I took to lure the queen to Fotheringay!  I've shamefully betrayed, I have exposed her  To her detested enemy's revilings!  Oh! never, never can she pardon that.  All will appear as if premeditated.  The bitter turn of this sad interview,  The triumph and the tauntings of her rival;  Yes, e'en the murderous hand which had prepared  A bloody, monstrous, unexpected fate;  All, all will be ascribed to my suggestions!  I see no rescue! nowhere--ha! Who comes?       [MORTIMER enters in the most violent uneasiness,     and looks with apprehension round him.    MORTIMER.  Lord Leicester! Is it you! Are we alone?    LEICESTER.  Ill-fated wretch, away! What seek you here?    MORTIMER.  They are upon our track--upon yours, too;  Be vigilant!    LEICESTER.         Away, away!    MORTIMER.                They know  That private conferences have been held  At Aubespine's----    LEICESTER.           What's that to me?    MORTIMER.                     They know, too,  That the assassin----    LEICESTER.             That is your affair--  Audacious wretch! to dare to mix my name  In your detested outrage: go; defend  Your bloody deeds yourself!    MORTIMER.                 But only hear me.    LEICESTER (violently enraged).  Down, down to hell! Why cling you at my heels  Like an infernal spirit! I disclaim you;  I know you not; I make no common cause  With murderers!    MORTIMER.           You will not hear me, then!  I came to warn you; you too are detected.    LEICESTER.  How! What?    MORTIMER.         Lord Burleigh went to Fotheringay  Just as the luckless deed had been attempted;  Searched with strict scrutiny the queen's apartments,  And found there----    LEICESTER.            What?    MORTIMER.               A letter which the queen  Had just addressed to you----    LEICESTER.                 Unhappy woman!    MORTIMER.  In which she calls on you to keep your word,  Renews the promise of her hand, and mentions  The picture which she sent you.    LEICESTER.                   Death and hell!    MORTIMER.  Lord Burleigh has the letter.    LEICESTER.                  I am lost!       [During the following speech of MORTIMER, LEICESTER     goes up and down as in despair.    MORTIMER.  Improve the moment; be beforehand with him,  And save yourself--save her! An oath can clear  Your fame; contrive excuses to avert  The worst. I am disarmed, can do no more;  My comrades are dispersed--to pieces fallen  Our whole confederacy. For Scotland I  To rally such new friends as there I may.  'Tis now your turn, my lord; try what your weight,  What bold assurance can effect.    LEICESTER (stops suddenly as if resolved).                   I will.       [Goes to the door, opens it, and calls.    Who waits without? Guards! seize this wretched traitor!       [To the officer, who comes in with soldiers.    And guard him closely! A most dreadful plot  Is brought to light--I'll to her majesty.    MORTIMER (stands for a time petrified with wonder; collects himself soon,       and follows LEICESTER with his looks expressive of the most       sovereign contempt).  Infamous wretch! But I deserve it all.  Who told me then to trust this practised villain?  Now o'er my head he strides, and on my fall  He builds the bridge of safety! be it so;  Go, save thyself--my lips are sealed forever;  I will not join even thee in my destruction;  I would not own thee, no, not even in death;  Life is the faithless villain's only good!       [To the officer of the guard, who steps forward to seize him.    What wilt thou, slave of tyranny, with me?  I laugh to scorn thy threatenings; I am free.       [Drawing a dagger.    OFFICER.  He's armed; rush in and wrest his weapon from him.       [They rush upon him, he defends himself.    MORTIMER (raising his voice).  And in this latest moment shall my heart  Expand itself in freedom, and my tongue  Shall break this long constraint. Curse and destruction  Light on you all who have betrayed your faith,  Your God, and your true sovereign! Who, alike  To earthly Mary false as to the heavenly,  Have sold your duties to this bastard queen!    OFFICER.  Hear you these blasphemies? Rush forward--seize him.    MORTIMER.  Beloved queen! I could not set thee free;  Yet take a lesson from me how to die.  Mary, thou holy one, O! pray for me!  And take me to thy heavenly home on high.

To lure me thither! trifle with me thus!  The traitor! Thus to lead me, as in triumph,  Into the presence of his paramour!  Oh, Burleigh! ne'er was woman so deceived.    BURLEIGH.

Now from this source issue for man two opposite exigencies, the two  fundamental laws of sensuous-rational nature. The first has for its  object absolute reality; it must make a world of what is only form,  manifest all that in it is only a force. The second law has for its  object absolute formality; it must destroy in him all that is only world,  and carry out harmony in all changes. In other terms, he must manifest  all that is internal, and give form to all that is external. Considered  in its most lofty accomplishment, this twofold labor brings back to the  idea of humanity, which was my starting-point.          LETTER XII.      This twofold labor or task, which consists in making the necessary pass  into reality in us and in making out of us reality subject to the law of  necessity, is urged upon us as a duty by two opposing forces, which are  justly styled impulsions or instincts, because they impel us to realize  their object. The first of these impulsions, which I shall call the  sensuous instinct, issues from the physical existence of man, or from  sensuous nature; and it is this instinct which tends to enclose him in  the limits of time, and to make of him a material being; I do not say to  give him matter, for to do that a certain free activity of the  personality would be necessary, which, receiving matter, distinguishes it  from the Ego, or what is permanent. By matter I only understand in this  place the change or reality that fills time. Consequently the instinct  requires that there should be change, and that time should contain  something. This simply filled state of time is named sensation, and it  is only in this state that physical existence manifests itself.    As all that is in time is successive, it follows by that fact alone that  something is: all the remainder is excluded. When one note on an  instrument is touched, among all those that it virtually offers, this  note alone is real. When man is actually modified, the infinite  possibility of all his modifications is limited to this single mode of  existence. Thus, then, the exclusive action of sensuous impulsion has  for its necessary consequence the narrowest limitation. In this state  man is only a unity of magnitude, a complete moment in time; or, to speak  more correctly, he is not, for his personality is suppressed as long as  sensation holds sway over him and carries time along with it.    This instinct extends its domains over the entire sphere of the finite in  man, and as form is only revealed in matter, and the absolute by means of  its limits, the total manifestation of human nature is connected on a  close analysis with the sensuous instinct. But though it is only this  instinct that awakens and develops what exists virtually in man, it is  nevertheless this very instinct which renders his perfection impossible.  It binds down to the world of sense by indestructible ties the spirit  that tends higher, and it calls back to the limits of the present,  abstraction which had its free development in the sphere of the infinite.  No doubt, thought can escape it for a moment, and a firm will  victoriously resist its exigencies: but soon compressed nature resumes  her rights to give an imperious reality to our existence, to give it  contents, substance, knowledge, and an aim for our activity.    The second impulsion, which may be named the formal instinct, issues from  the absolute existence of man, or from his rational nature, and tends to  set free, and bring harmony into the diversity of its manifestations, and  to maintain personality notwithstanding all the changes of state. As  this personality, being an absolute and indivisible unity, can never be  in contradiction with itself, as we are ourselves forever, this  impulsion, which tends to maintain personality, can never exact in one  time anything but what it exacts and requires forever. It therefore  decides for always what it decides now, and orders now what it orders  forever. Hence it embraces the whole series of times, or what comes to  the same thing, it suppresses time and change. It wishes the real to be  necessary and eternal, and it wishes the eternal and the necessary to be  real; in other terms, it tends to truth and justice.    If the sensuous instinct only produces accidents, the formal instinct  gives laws, laws for every judgment when it is a question of knowledge,  laws for every will when it is a question of action. Whether, therefore,  we recognize an object or conceive an objective value to a state of the  subject, whether we act in virtue of knowledge or make of the objective  the determining principle of our state; in both cases we withdraw this  state from the jurisdiction of time, and we attribute to it reality for  all men and for all time, that is, universality and necessity. Feeling  can only say: \"That is true for this subject and at this moment,\" and  there may come another moment, another subject, which withdraws the  affirmation from the actual feeling. But when once thought pronounces  and says: \"That is,\" it decides forever and ever, and the validity of its  decision is guaranteed by the personality itself, which defies all  change. Inclination can only say: \"That is good for your individuality  and present necessity\"; but the changing current of affairs will sweep  them away, and what you ardently desire to-day will form the object of  your aversion to-morrow. But when the moral feeling says: \"That ought to  be,\" it decides forever. If you confess the truth because it is the  truth, and if you practise justice because it is justice, you have made  of a particular case the law of all possible cases, and treated one  moment of your life as eternity.    Accordingly, when the formal impulse holds sway and the pure object acts  in us, the being attains its highest expansion, all barriers disappear,  and from the unity of magnitude in which man was enclosed by a narrow  sensuousness, he rises to the unity of idea, which embraces and keeps  subject the entire sphere of phenomena. During this operation we are no  longer in time, but time is in us with its infinite succession. We are  no longer individuals but a species; the judgment of all spirits is  expressed by our own, and the choice of all hearts is represented by our  own act.          LETTER XIII.      On a first survey, nothing appears more opposed than these two  impulsions; one having for its object change, the other immutability, and  yet it is these two notions that exhaust the notion of humanity, and a  third fundamental impulsion, holding a medium between them, is quite  inconceivable. How then shall we re-establish the unity of human nature,  a unity that appears completely destroyed by this primitive and radical  opposition?    I admit these two tendencies are contradictory, but it should be noticed  that they are not so in the same objects. But things that do not meet  cannot come into collision. No doubt the sensuous impulsion desires  change; but it does not wish that it should extend to personality and its  field, nor that there should be a change of principles. The formal  impulsion seeks unity and permanence, but it does not wish the condition  to remain fixed with the person, that there should be identity of  feeling. Therefore these two impulsions are not divided by nature, and  if, nevertheless, they appear so, it is because they have become divided  by transgressing nature freely, by ignoring themselves, and by  confounding their spheres. The office of culture is to watch over them  and to secure to each one its proper limits; therefore culture has to  give equal justice to both, and to defend not only the rational impulsion  against the sensuous, but also the latter against the former. Hence she  has to act a twofold part: first, to protect sense against the attacks of  freedom; secondly, to secure personality against the power of sensations.  One of these ends is attained by the cultivation of the sensuous, the  other by that of reason.    Since the world is developed in time, or change, the perfection of the  faculty that places men in relation with the world will necessarily be  the greatest possible mutability and extensiveness. Since personality is  permanence in change, the perfection of this faculty, which must be  opposed to change, will be the greatest possible freedom of action  (autonomy) and intensity. The more the receptivity is developed under  manifold aspects, the more it is movable and offers surfaces to  phenomena, the larger is the part of the world seized upon by man, and  the more virtualities he develops in himself. Again, in proportion as  man gains strength and depth, and depth and reason gain in freedom, in  that proportion man takes in a larger share of the world, and throws out  forms outside himself. Therefore his culture will consist, first, in  placing his receptivity in contact with the world in the greatest number  of points possible, and in raising passivity, to the highest exponent on  the side of feeling; secondly, in procuring for the determining faculty  the greatest possible amount of independence, in relation to the  receptive power, and in raising activity to the highest degree on the  side of reason. By the union of these two qualities man will associate  the highest degree of self-spontaneity (autonomy) and of freedom with the  fullest plenitude of existence, and instead of abandoning himself to the  world so as to get lost in it, he will rather absorb it in himself, with  all the infinitude of its phenomena, and subject it to the unity of his  reason.    But man can invert this relation, and thus fail in attaining his  destination in two ways. He can hand over to the passive force the  intensity demanded by the active force; he can encroach by material  impulsion on "]]]
