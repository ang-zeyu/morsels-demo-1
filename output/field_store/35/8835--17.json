The shed cut out within three weeks and the two sundowners took the  track again, Brummy with two pounds odd in his pocket--he having  negotiated his cheque at the shed.    But now there was suspicion, envy, and distrust in the hearts of those  two wayfarers. Brummy was now a bloated capitalist, and proud, and  anxious to get rid of Swampy--at least Swampy thought so. He thought  that the least that Brummy might have done was to have shared the  \"stuff\" with him.    \"Look here, Brummy,\" he said reproachfully, \"we've shared and shared  alike, and----\"    \"We never shared money,\" said Brummy, decidedly.    \"Do you think I want yer blasted money?\" retorted Swampy, indignantly.  \"When did I ever ask yer for a sprat? Tell me that!\"    \"You wouldn't have got it if you had asked,\" said Brummy,  uncompromisingly. \"Look here!\" with vehemence. \"Didn't I keep yer in  tobacco and buy yer gory pants? What are you naggin' about anyway?\"    \"Well,\" said Swampy, \"all I was goin' to say was that yer might let me  carry one of them quids in case you lost one--yer know you're careless  and lose things; or in case anything happened to you.\"    \"I ain't going to lose it--if that's all that's fretting you,\" said  Brummy, \"and there ain't nothing going to happen to me--and don't you  forget it.\"    \"That's all the thanks I get for givin' yer my gory job,\" said Swampy,  savagely. \"I won't be sick a soft fool agen, I can tell yer.\"    Brummy was silent, and Swampy dropped behind. He brooded darkly,  and it's a bad thing for a man to brood in the bush. He was reg'lar  disgusted with Brummy. He'd allers acted straight to him, and Brummy  had acted like a \"cow.\" He'd stand it no longer; but he'd have some  satisfaction. He wouldn't be a fool. If Brummy was mean skunk enough to  act to a mate like that, Swampy would be even with him; he would wait  till Brummy was asleep, collar the stuff, and clear. It was his job,  anyway, and the money was his by rights. He'd have his rights.    Brummy, who carried the billy, gave Swampy a long tramp before he camped  and made a fire. They had tea in silence, and smoked moodily apart until  Brummy turned in. They usually slept on the ground, with a few leaves  under them, or on the sand where there was any, each wrapped in his own  blankets, and with their spare clothes, or rags rather, for pillows.  Presently Swampy turned in and pretended to sleep, but he lay awake  watching, and listening to Brummy's breathing. When he thought it was  safe he moved cautiously and slipped his hand under Brummy's head, but  Brummy's old pocket-book--in which he carried some dirty old letters in  a woman's handwriting--was not there. All next day Swampy watched Brummy  sharply every time he put his hands into his pockets, to try and find  out in which pocket he kept his money. Brummy seemed very cheerful and  sociable, even considerate, to his mate all day, and Swampy pretended to  be happy. They yarned more than they had done for many a day. Brummy was  a heavy sleeper, and that night Swampy went over him carefully and felt  all his pockets, but without success. Next day Brummy seemed in high  spirits--they were nearing Bourke, where they intended to loaf round  the pubs for a week or two. On the third night Swampy waited till about  midnight, and then searched Brummy, every inch of him he could get at,  and tickled him, with a straw of grass till he turned over, and ran his  hands over the other side of him, and over his feet (Brummy slept with  his socks on), and looked in his boots, and in the billy and in the  tucker-bags, and felt in every tuft of grass round the camp, and under  every bush, and down a hollow stump, and up a hollow log: but there  was no pocket-book. Brummy couldn't have lost the money and kept it  dark--he'd have gone back to look for it at once. Perhaps he'd thrown  away the book and sewn the money in his clothes somewhere. Swampy crept  back to him and felt the lining of his hat, and was running his hand  over Brummy's chest when Brummy suddenly started to snore, and Swampy  desisted without loss of time. He crept back to bed, breathing short,  and thought hard. It struck him that there was something aggressive  about that snore. He began to suspect that Brummy was up to his little  game, and it pained him.    Next morning Brummy was decidedly frivolous. At any other time Swampy  would have put it down to a \"touch o' the sun,\" but now he felt a  growing conviction that Brummy knew what he'd been up to the last three  nights, and the more he thought of it the more it pained him--till at  last he could stand it no longer.    \"Look here, Brummy,\" he said frankly, \"where the hell do you keep that  flamin' stuff o' yourn? I been tryin' to git at it ever since we left  West-o'-Sunday.\"    \"I know you have, Swampy,\" said Brummy, affectionately--as if he  considered that Swampy had done his best in the interests of mateship.    \"I _knowed_ yer knowed!\" exclaimed Swampy, triumphantly. \"But where the  blazes did yer put it?\"    \"Under _your_ head, Swampy, old man,\" said Brummy, cheerfully.    Swampy was hurt now. He commented in the language that used to be used  by the bullock-punchers of the good days as they pranced up and down by  their teams and lammed into the bullocks with saplings and crow-bars,  and called on them to lift a heavy load out of a bog in the bed of a  muddy creek.    \"Never mind, Swampy!\" said Brummy, soothingly, as his mate paused and  tried to remember worse oaths. \"It wasn't your fault.\"    But they parted at Bourke. Swampy had allers acted straight ter  Brummy--share 'n' share alike. He'd do as much for a mate as any other  man, an' put up with as much from a mate. He had put up with a lot from  Brummy: he'd picked him up on the track and learned him all he knowed;  Brummy would have starved many a time if it hadn't been for Swampy;  Swampy had learned him how to \"battle.\" He'd stick to Brummy yet, but he  couldn't stand ingratitude. He hated low cunnin' an' suspicion, and when  a gory mate got suspicious of his own old mate and wouldn't trust him,  an' took to plantin' his crimson money--it was time to leave him.          A SKETCH OF MATESHIP      Bill and Jim, professional shearers, were coming into Bourke from the  Queensland side. They were horsemen and had two packhorses. At the last  camp before Bourke Jim's packhorse got disgusted and home-sick during  the night and started back for the place where he was foaled. Jim was  little more than a new-chum jackaroo; he was no bushman and generally  got lost when he went down the next gully. Bill was a bushman, so it was  decided that he should go back to look for the horse.    Now Bill was going to sell his packhorse, a well-bred mare, in Bourke,  and he was anxious to get her into the yards before the horse sales  were over; this was to be the last day of the sales. Jim was the  best \"barracker\" of the two; he had great imagination; he was a very  entertaining story-teller and conversationalist in social life, and a  glib and a most impressive liar in business, so it was decided that he  should hurry on into Bourke with the mare and sell her for Bill. Seven  pounds, reserve.    Next day Bill turned up with the missing horse and saw Jim standing  against a veranda-post of the Carriers' Arms, with his hat down over his  eyes, and thoughtfully spitting in the dust. Bill rode over to him.    \"'Ullo, Jim.\"    \"'Ullo, Bill. I see you got him.\"    \"Yes, I got him.\"    Pause.    \"Where'd yer find him?\"    \"'Bout ten mile back. Near Ford's Bridge. He was just feedin' along.\"    Pause. Jim shifted his feet and spat in the dust.    \"Well,\" said Bill at last. \"How did you get on, Jim?\"    \"Oh, all right,\" said Jim. \"I sold the mare.\"    \"That's right,\" said Bill. \"How much did she fetch?\"    \"Eight quid;\" then, rousing himself a little and showing some emotion,  \"An' I could 'a' got ten quid for her if I hadn't been a dam' fool.\"    \"Oh, that's good enough,\" said Bill.    \"I could 'a' got ten quid if I'd 'a' waited.\"    \"Well, it's no use cryin'. Eight quid is good enough. Did you get the  stuff?\"    \"Oh, yes. They parted all right. If I hadn't been such a dam' fool an'  rushed it, there was a feller that would 'a' given ten quid for that  mare.\"    \"Well, don't break yer back about it,\" said Bill. \"Eight is good  enough.\"    \"Yes. But I could 'a' got ten,\" said Jim, languidly, putting his hand in  his pocket.    Pause. Bill sat waiting for him to hand over the money; but Jim withdrew  his hand empty, stretched, and said:    \"Ah, well, Bill, I done it in. Lend us a couple o' notes.\"    Jim had been drinking and gambling all night and he'd lost the eight  pounds as well as his own money.    Bill didn't explode. What was the use? He should have known that Jim  wasn't to be trusted with money in town. It was he who had been the  fool. He sighed and lent Jim a pound, and they went in to have a drink.    Now it strikes me that if this had happened in a civilized country (like  England) Bill would have had Jim arrested and jailed for larceny as a  bailee, or embezzlement, or whatever it was. And would Bill or Jim or  the world have been any better for it?          ON THE TUCKER TRACK: A STEELMAN STORY      Steelman and Smith, professional wanderers from New Zealand, took a run  over to Australia one year to have a look at the country, and drifted  out back, and played cards and \"headin' 'em\" at the shearing-sheds  (while pretending to be strangers to each other), and sold eye-water and  unpatented medicine, and worked the tucker tracks. They struck a streak  of bad luck at West-o'-Sunday Station, where they were advised (by the  boss and about fifty excited shearers) to go east, and not to stop  till they reached the coast. They were tramping along the track towards  Bourke; they were very hard up and had to \"battle\" for tucker and  tobacco along the track. They came to a lonely shanty, about two camps  west"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7070"],[0,"The Treasure of the Incas: A Story of Adventure in Peru (#15)"],[1,"Colombia, and Peru.\"    \"I suppose they will be fighting all round some day?\"    \"Yes, and it will interfere with my business. Certainly we are better  off than when the Spaniards were here; but the taxes are heavy, and  things don't go as people expected they would when we got rid of the  Spaniards. All the governments seem jealous of each other. I don't take  any interest in these matters except so far as they interfere with  trade. If every man would attend to his own affairs it would be better  for us all.\"    \"I suppose so, Dias; but one can hardly expect a country that has been  so many years governed by a foreign power to get accustomed all at once  to governing itself.\"    \"Now, senor, I shall be glad if you will go with me and look at the  stores that are already collected. I think you will find that  everything is ready.\"          CHAPTER V    AMONG THE MOUNTAIN      Two days later the mules were brought round to the door at sunrise, and  Harry and his brother sallied out from the hotel, dressed for the first  time in the Peruvian costume. They were both warmly clothed. On their  heads were felt hats with broad brims, which could be pulled down and  tied over the ears, both for warmth and to prevent their being blown  away by the fierce winds that sweep down the gorges. A thick poncho of  llama wool fell from their shoulders to their knees, and loosely tied  round their necks were thick and brightly-coloured scarves. They wore  high boots, and carried large knives stuck in a strap below the knee.  The rifles were fastened at the bow of their saddles, and their  wallets, with provisions for the day, were strapped behind. By the  advice of Dias each had in his pocket a large pair of green goggles, to  protect their eyes from the glare of sun and snow. They tied these on  before coming downstairs, and both agreed that had they met  unexpectedly in the street they would have passed each other without  the slightest recognition.    \"It is a pity, Harry,\" Bertie said seriously, \"that you did not have  your portrait taken to send home to a certain young lady. You see, she  would then have been able to hang it up in her room and worship it  privately, without anyone having the slightest idea that it was her  absent lover.\"    \"You young scamp,\" Harry said, \"I will pull your ears for you.\"    \"If you attempt anything of the sort, I shall tie the brim of my hat  tightly over them. I really think it is very ungrateful of you not to  take my advice in the spirit in which I gave it.\"    \"If you intend to go on like this, Bert, I shall leave you behind.\"    \"You can't do it.\"    \"Oh, yes, I can! I might give you in charge for some crime or other;  and in lack of evidence, the expenditure of a few dollars would, I have  no doubt, be sufficient to induce the judge, magistrate, or whatever  they call him, to give you six months' imprisonment.\"    \"Then you are an unnatural brother, and I will make no more suggestions  for your good.\"    So they had come downstairs laughing, though feeling a little shy at  their appearance as they issued out of the courtyard. Speedily,  however, they gained courage as they saw that passers-by paid no  attention to them.    They had spent the previous afternoon in packing the bundles, in which  every item was put away so that it could be got at readily, and in  making sure that nothing had been omitted. The five baggage mules were  fastened one behind another, and Jose stood at the head of the leading  one. As they came out Dias swung his wife on to a cushion strapped  behind his saddle, and mounted himself before her. Harry and his  brother climbed into theirs. They had both refused to put on the heavy  and cruel spurs worn by the Peruvians, but had, at the earnest request  of the Indian, put them in their saddle-bags.    \"You will want them,\" he said. \"You need not use them cruelly, but you  must give your mules an occasional prick to let them know that you have  spurs.\"    On leaving the town the road ran up the valley of the Rimac, a small  river, but of vital importance to the country through which it passes,  as small canals branching from it irrigate the land.    \"The Spaniards have done some good here at least,\" Harry said to Dias,  who was riding beside him.    \"Some of these canals were constructed in their time, but the rest  existed long before they came here, and, indeed, long before the Incas  came. The Incas' work lies chiefly beyond the mountains; on this side  almost all the great ruins are of cities and fortresses built by the  old people. Cuzco was the Incas' capital, and almost all the towns  between the two ranges of the Andes were their work. It is true that  they conquered the people down to the sea, but they do not seem to have  cared to live here. The treasures of Pachacamac and the other places on  the plains were those of the old people and the old religion. The  inhabitants of the plains are for the most part descendants of those  people. The Incas were strong and powerful, but they were not numerous.  That was why the Spaniards conquered them so easily. The old people,  who regarded them as their masters, did not care to fight for them,  just as the Peruvians did not care to fight for the Spaniards.\"    \"I expect it was a good deal like the Normans in England,\" Bertie put  in. \"They conquered the Saxons because they were better armed and  better disciplined, but they were few in number in comparison with the  number they governed, and in their quarrels with each other the bulk of  the people stood aloof; and it was only when the Normans began their  wars in France and Scotland, and were obliged to enlist Saxon archers  and soldiers, that the two began to unite and to become one people.\"    \"I have no doubt that was so, Bertie; but you are breaking our  agreement that you should speak in Spanish only.\"    \"Oh, bother! you know very well that I cannot talk in it yet, and you  surely do not expect that I am going to ride along without opening my  lips.\"    \"I know you too well to expect that,\" Harry laughed, \"and will allow an  occasional outbreak. Still, do try to talk Spanish, however bad it may  be. You have got cheek enough in other things, and cheek goes a long  way in learning to talk a foreign language. You have been four months  at your Spanish books, and should certainly begin to put simple  sentences together.\"    \"But that is just what one does not learn from books,\" the lad said.  \"At any rate, not from such books as I have been working at. I could do  a high-flown sentence, and offer to kiss your hand and to declare that  all I have is at your disposal. But if I wanted to say, 'When are we  going to halt for dinner? I am feeling very peckish,' I should be  stumped altogether.\"    \"Well, you must get as near as you can, Bertie. I dare say you cannot  turn slang into Spanish; but you can find other words to express your  meaning, and when you cannot hit on a word you must use an English one.  Your best plan is to move along on the other side of Dias, and chat to  his wife.\"    \"What have I got to say to her?\"    \"Anything you like. You can begin by asking her if she has ever gone a  long journey with her husband before, how far we shall go  to-day--things of that sort.\"    \"Well, I will try anyhow. I suppose I must. But you go on talking to  Dias, else I shall think that you are both laughing at me.\"    Five miles from Lima they passed through the little village of Quiraz.  Beyond this they came upon many cotton plantations, and in the ravines  by the side of the valley or among the ruins of Indian towns were  several large fortresses. They also passed the remains of an old  Spanish town and several haciendas, where many cattle and horses were  grazing. They were ascending steadily, and after passing Santa Clara,  eleven miles from Lima, the valley narrowed and became little more than  a ravine. On either side were rents made in the hills by earthquakes,  and immense boulders and stones were scattered about at the bottom of  the narrow gorge. Four hours' travelling brought them to Chosica, where  the valley widened again near the foot of the hills.    Here they halted for the day. There was an inn here which Dias assured  them was clean and comfortable, and they therefore took a couple of  rooms for the night in preference to unpacking their tents.    \"It is just as well not to begin that till we get farther away,\" Harry  said. \"We have met any number of laden mules coming down, and if we  were to camp here we should cause general curiosity.\"    He accordingly ordered dinner for himself and his brother, Dias  preferring to take his meal in a large room used by passing muleteers.  The fare was as good as they had had at the hotel at Lima.    \"I am not sorry that we halted here,\" Bertie said; \"I feel as stiff as  a poker.\"    \"I think you got on very well, Bertie, with Mrs. Dias. I did not hear  what you were saying, but you seemed to be doing stunningly.\"    \"She did most of the talking. I asked her to speak slowly, as I did not  manage to catch the sense of what she said. She seems full of fun, and  a jolly little woman altogether. She generally understood what I meant,  and though she could not help laughing sometimes, she did it so  good-temperedly that one did not feel put out. Each time I spoke she  corrected me, told me what I ought to have said, and made me say it  after her. I think I shall get on fairly well at the end of a few  weeks.\"    \"I am sure you will, Bertie; the trouble is only at the beginning, and  now that you have once broken the ice, you will progress like a house  on fire.\"    There were still four hours of daylight after they had finished their  meal, so they went out with Dias to explore one of the numerous  burying-grounds round the village. It consisted of sunken chambers. In  these were bones, with remains of the mats in which the bodies had been  clothed. These wrappings resembled small sacks, and they remarked that"]]]
