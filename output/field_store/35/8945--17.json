Moreover, M. Albert Lambert explained that the  Prince, who only meant to stay in Liverpool a few days, was on his way  to Chicago, where he wished to visit Princess Anna Semionicz, his  sister, who was married to Mr. Girwan, the great copper king and  multi-millionaire.    \"Yet, as I told you before, in spite of all these undoubted securities,  suspicion of the wealthy Russian Prince lurked in the minds of most  Liverpudlians who came in business contact with him. He had been at the  North-Western two days when he sent his secretary to Window and  Vassall, the jewellers of Bold Street, with a request that they would  kindly send a representative round to the hotel with some nice pieces of  jewellery, diamonds and pearls chiefly, which he was desirous of taking  as a present to his sister in Chicago.    \"Mr. Winslow took the order from M. Albert with a pleasant bow. Then he  went to his inner office and consulted with his partner, Mr. Vassall, as  to the best course to adopt. Both the gentlemen were desirous of doing  business, for business had been very slack lately: neither wished to  refuse a possible customer, or to offend Mr. Pettitt, the manager of the  North-Western, who had recommended them to the Prince. But that foreign  title and the vulgar little French secretary stuck in the throats of the  two pompous and worthy Liverpool jewellers, and together they agreed,  firstly, that no credit should be given; and, secondly, that if a cheque  or even a banker's draft were tendered, the jewels were not to be given  up until that cheque or draft was cashed.    \"Then came the question as to who should take the jewels to the hotel.  It was altogether against business etiquette for the senior partners to  do such errands themselves; moreover, it was thought that it would be  easier for a clerk to explain, without giving undue offence, that he  could not take the responsibility of a cheque or draft, without having  cashed it previously to giving up the jewels.    \"Then there was the question of the probable necessity of conferring in  a foreign tongue. The head assistant, Charles Needham, who had been in  the employ of Winslow and Vassall for over twelve years, was, in true  British fashion, ignorant of any language save his own; it was therefore  decided to dispatch Mr. Schwarz, a young German clerk lately arrived, on  the delicate errand.    \"Mr. Schwarz was Mr. Winslow's nephew and godson, a sister of that  gentleman having married the head of the great German firm of Schwarz &  Co., silversmiths, of Hamburg and Berlin.    \"The young man had soon become a great favourite with his uncle, whose  heir he would presumably be, as Mr. Winslow had no children.    \"At first Mr. Vassall made some demur about sending Mr. Schwarz with so  many valuable jewels alone in a city which he had not yet had the time  to study thoroughly; but finally he allowed himself to be persuaded by  his senior partner, and a fine selection of necklaces, pendants,  bracelets, and rings, amounting in value to over L16,000, having been  made, it was decided that Mr. Schwarz should go to the North-Western in  a cab the next day at about three o'clock in the afternoon. This he  accordingly did, the following day being a Thursday.    \"Business went on in the shop as usual under the direction of the head  assistant, until about seven o'clock, when Mr. Winslow returned from his  club, where he usually spent an hour over the papers every afternoon,  and at once asked for his nephew. To his astonishment Mr. Needham  informed him that Mr. Schwarz had not yet returned. This seemed a little  strange, and Mr. Winslow, with a slightly anxious look in his face, went  into the inner office in order to consult his junior partner. Mr.  Vassall offered to go round to the hotel and interview Mr. Pettitt.    \"'I was beginning to get anxious myself,' he said, 'but did not quite  like to say so. I have been in over half an hour, hoping every moment  that you would come in, and that perhaps you could give me some  reassuring news. I thought that perhaps you had met Mr. Schwarz, and  were coming back together.'    \"However, Mr. Vassall walked round to the hotel and interviewed the hall  porter. The latter perfectly well remembered Mr. Schwarz sending in his  card to Prince Semionicz.    \"'At what time was that?' asked Mr. Vassall.    \"'About ten minutes past three, sir, when he came; it was about an hour  later when he left.'    \"'When he left?' gasped, more than said, Mr. Vassall.    \"'Yes, sir. Mr. Schwarz left here about a quarter before four, sir.'    \"'Are you quite sure?'    \"'Quite sure. Mr. Pettitt was in the hall when he left, and he asked him  something about business. Mr. Schwarz laughed and said, \"not bad.\" I  hope there's nothing wrong, sir,' added the man.    \"'Oh--er--nothing--thank you. Can I see Mr. Pettitt?'    \"'Certainly, sir.'    \"Mr. Pettitt, the manager of the hotel, shared Mr. Vassall's anxiety,  immediately he heard that the young German had not yet returned home.    \"'I spoke to him a little before four o'clock. We had just switched on  the electric light, which we always do these winter months at that hour.  But I shouldn't worry myself, Mr. Vassall; the young man may have seen  to some business on his way home. You'll probably find him in when you  go back.'    \"Apparently somewhat reassured, Mr. Vassall thanked Mr. Pettitt and  hurried back to the shop, only to find that Mr. Schwarz had not  returned, though it was now close on eight o'clock.    \"Mr. Winslow looked so haggard and upset that it would have been cruel  to heap reproaches upon his other troubles or to utter so much as the  faintest suspicion that young Schwarz's permanent disappearance with  L16,000 in jewels and money was within the bounds of probability.    \"There was one chance left, but under the circumstances a very slight  one indeed. The Winslows' private house was up the Birkenhead end of the  town. Young Schwarz had been living with them ever since his arrival in  Liverpool, and he may have--either not feeling well or for some other  reason--gone straight home without calling at the shop. It was unlikely,  as valuable jewellery was never kept at the private house, but--it just  might have happened.    \"It would be useless,\" continued the man in the corner, \"and decidedly  uninteresting, were I to relate to you Messrs. Winslow's and Vassall's  further anxieties with regard to the missing young man. Suffice it to  say that on reaching his private house Mr. Winslow found that his godson  had neither returned nor sent any telegraphic message of any kind.    \"Not wishing to needlessly alarm his wife, Mr. Winslow made an attempt  at eating his dinner, but directly after that he hurried back to the  North-Western Hotel, and asked to see Prince Semionicz. The Prince was  at the theatre with his secretary, and probably would not be home until  nearly midnight.    \"Mr. Winslow, then, not knowing what to think, nor yet what to fear, and  in spite of the horror he felt of giving publicity to his nephew's  disappearance, thought it his duty to go round to the police-station and  interview the inspector. It is wonderful how quickly news of that type  travels in a large city like Liverpool. Already the morning papers of  the following day were full of the latest sensation: 'Mysterious  disappearance of a well-known tradesman.'    \"Mr. Winslow found a copy of the paper containing the sensational  announcement on his breakfast-table. It lay side by side with a letter  addressed to him in his nephew's handwriting, which had been posted in  Liverpool.    \"Mr. Winslow placed that letter, written to him by his nephew, into the  hands of the police. Its contents, therefore, quickly became public  property. The astounding statements made therein by Mr. Schwarz created,  in quiet, businesslike Liverpool, a sensation which has seldom been  equalled.    \"It appears that the young fellow did call on Prince Semionicz at a  quarter past three on Wednesday, December 10th, with a bag full of  jewels, amounting in value to some L16,000. The Prince duly admired, and  finally selected from among the ornaments a necklace, pendant, and  bracelet, the whole being priced by Mr. Schwarz, according to his  instructions, at L10,500. Prince Semionicz was most prompt and  businesslike in his dealings.    \"'You will require immediate payment for these, of course,' he said in  perfect English, 'and I know you business men prefer solid cash to  cheques, especially when dealing with foreigners. I always provide  myself with plenty of Bank of England notes in consequence,' he added  with a pleasant smile, 'as L10,500 in gold would perhaps be a little  inconvenient to carry. If you will kindly make out the receipt, my  secretary, M. Lambert, will settle all business matters with you.'    \"He thereupon took the jewels he had selected and locked them up in his  dressing-case, the beautiful silver fillings of which Mr. Schwarz just  caught a short glimpse of. Then, having been accommodated with paper and  ink, the young jeweller made out the account and receipt, whilst M.  Lambert, the secretary, counted out before him 105 crisp Bank of England  notes of L100 each. Then, with a final bow to his exceedingly urbane and  eminently satisfactory customer, Mr. Schwarz took his leave. In the hall  he saw and spoke to Mr. Pettitt, and then he went out into the street.    \"He had just left the hotel and was about to cross towards St. George's  Hall when "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#16)"],[1,"arms and prudent policy of Egbert at last  effected what had been so often attempted in vain by so many princes  [n].  Kent, Northumberland, and Mercia, which had successively aspired  to general dominion, were now incorporated in his empire, and the  other subordinate kingdoms seemed willingly to share the same fate.  His territories were nearly of the same extent with what is now  properly called England; and a favourable prospect was afforded to the  Anglo-Saxons, of establishing a civilized monarchy, possessed of  tranquillity within itself, and secure against foreign invasion.  This  great event happened in the year 827 [o].  [FN [n] Chron. Sax. p. 71.  [o] Ibid.]    The Saxons, though they had been so long settled in the island, seem  not as yet to have been much improved beyond their German ancestors,  either in arts, civility, knowledge, humanity, justice, or obedience  to the laws.  Even Christianity, though it opened the way to  connexions between them and the more polished states of Europe, had  not hitherto been very effectual in banishing their ignorance, or  softening their barbarous manners.  As they received that doctrine  through the corrupted channels of Rome, it carried along with it a  great mixture of credulity and superstition, equally destructive to  the understanding and to morals.  The reverence towards saints and  relics seems to have almost supplanted the adoration of the Supreme  Being.  Monastic observances were esteemed more meritorious than the  active virtues; the knowledge of natural causes were neglected from  the universal belief of miraculous interpositions and judgments;  bounty to the church atoned for every violence against society; and  the remorses for cruelty, murder, treachery, assassination, and the  more robust vices, were appeased, not by amendment of life, but by  penances, servility to the monks, and an abject and illiberal devotion  [p].  The reverence for the clergy had been carried to such a height,  that, wherever a person appeared in a sacerdotal habit, though on the  high way, the people flocked around him, and, showing him all marks of  profound respect, received every word he uttered as the most sacred  oracle [q].  Even the military virtues, so inherent in all the Saxon  tribes, began to be neglected; and the nobility, preferring the  security and sloth of the cloister to the tumults and glory of war,  valued themselves chiefly on endowing monasteries, of which they  assumed the government [r].  The several kings, too, being extremely  impoverished by continual benefactions to the church to which the  states of their kingdoms had weakly assented, could bestow no rewards  on valour or military services, and retained not even sufficient  influence to support their government [s].  [FN [p] These abuses were common to all the European churches, but the  priests in Italy, Spain, and Gaul made some atonement for them, by  other advantages which they rendered society.  For several ages, they  were almost all Romans, or, in other words, the ancient natives, and  they preserved the Roman language and laws, with some remains of the  former civility.  But the priests in the Heptarchy, after the first  missionaries, were wholly Saxons, and almost as ignorant and barbarous  as the laity.  They contributed, therefore, little to the improvement  of society in knowledge or the arts.  [q] Bede, lib 3. cap. 26.  [r]  Ibid. lib. 5. cap. 23.  Epistola Bedae ad Egbert.  [s] Bedae Epist. ad  Egbert.]    Another inconvenience which attended this corrupt species of  Christianity, was the superstitious attachment to Rome, and the  gradual subjection of the kingdom to a foreign jurisdiction.  The  Britons, having never acknowledged any subordination to the Roman  pontiff, had conducted all ecclesiastical government by their domestic  synods and councils [t]; but the Saxons, receiving their religion from  Roman monks, were taught at the same time a profound reverence for  that see, and were naturally led to regard it as the capital of their  religion.  Pilgrimages to Rome were represented as the most  meritorious acts of devotion.  Not only noblemen and ladies of rank  undertook this tedious journey [u], but kings themselves, abdicating  their crowns, sought for a secure passport to heaven at the feet of  the Roman pontiff; new relics, perpetually sent from that endless mint  of superstition, and magnified by lying miracles, invented in  convents, operated on the astonished minds of the multitude; and every  prince has attained the eulogies of the monks, the only historians of  those ages, not in proportion to his civil and military virtues, but  to his devoted attachment towards their order, and his superstitious  reverence for Rome.  [FN [t] Append. to Bede, numb. 10. ex edit, 1722.  Spellm. Conc. p.  108, 109.  [u] Bede, lib. 5. c. 7.]    The sovereign pontiff, encouraged by this blindness and submissive  disposition of the people, advanced every day in his encroachments on  the independence of the English churches.  Wilfrid, Bishop of  Lindisferne, the sole prelate of the Northumbrian kingdom, increased  this subjection in the eighth century, by his making an appeal to Rome  against the decisions of an English synod, which had abridged his  diocese by the erection of some new bishoprics [w].  Agatho, the pope,  readily embraced this precedent of an appeal to his court; and  Wilfrid, though the haughtiest and most luxurious prelate of his age  [x], having obtained with the people the character of sanctity, was  thus able to lay the foundation of this papal pretension.  [FN [w] See Appendix to Bede, numb. 19.  Higden, lib. 5.  [x] Eddius,  vita Vilfr. sec. 24, 60]    The great topic by which Wilfrid confounded the imaginations of men  was, that St. Peter, to whose custody the keys of heaven were  intrusted, would certainly refuse admittance to every one who should  be wanting in respect to his successor.  This conceit, well suited to  vulgar conceptions, made great impression on the people during several  ages, and has not even at present lost all influence in the catholic  countries.    Had this abject superstition produced general peace and tranquillity,  it had made some atonement for the ill attending it; but besides the  usual avidity of men for power and riches, frivolous controversies in  theology were engendered by it, which were so much the more fatal, as  they admitted not, like the others, of any final determination from  established possession.  The disputes excited in Britain were of the  most ridiculous kind, and entirely worthy of those ignorant and  barbarous ages.  There were some intricacies, observed by all the  Christian churches, in adjusting the day of keeping Easter, which  depended on a complicated consideration of the course of the sun and  moon: and it happened that the missionaries, who had converted the  Scots and Britons, had followed a different calendar from that which  was observed at Rome in the age when Augustine converted the Saxons.  The priests also of all the Christian churches were accustomed to  shave part of their head; but the form given to this tonsure was  different in the former from what was practised in the latter.  The  Scots and Britons pleaded the antiquity of THEIR usages; the Romans,  and their disciples, the Saxons, insisted on the universality of  THEIRS.  That Easter must necessarily be kept by a rule, which  comprehended both the day of the year and age of the moon, was agreed  by all; that the tonsure of a priest could not be omitted without the  utmost impiety, was a point undisputed; but the Romans and Saxons  called their antagonists schismatics, because they celebrated Easter  on the very day of the full moon in March, if that day fell on a  Sunday, instead of waiting till the Sunday following; and because they  shaved the forepart of their head from ear to ear, instead of making  that tonsure on the crown of the head, and in a circular form.  In  order to render their antagonists odious, they affirmed, that once in  seven years, they concurred with the Jews in the time of celebrating  that festival [y]; and that they might recommend their own form of  tonsure, they maintained that it imitated symbolically the crown of  thorns worn by Christ in his passion, whereas the other form was  invented by Simon Magus, without any regard to that representation  [z].  These controversies had, from the beginning, excited such  animosity between the British and Romish priests, that, instead of  concurring in their endeavours to convert the idolatrous Saxons, they  refused all communion together, and each regarded his opponent as no  better than a pagan [a].  The dispute lasted more than a century, and  was at last finished, not by men's discovering the folly of it, which  would have been too great an effort for human reason to accomplish,  but by the entire prevalence of the Romish ritual over the Scotch and  British [b].  Wilfrid, Bishop of Lindisferne, acquired great merit,  both with the court of Rome and with all the Southern Saxons, by  expelling the quartodeciman schism, as it was called, from the  Northumbrian kingdom, into which the neighbourhood of the Scots had  formerly introduced it [c].  [FN [y] Bede, lib. 2. cap. 19.  [z] Ibid. lib. 5. cap. 21.  Eddius,  Sec. 24.  [a] Bede, lib. 2. cap. 2. 4. 20.  Eddius, Sec. 12.  [b]  Bede, lib. 5. cap. 16, 22.  [c] Bede, lib. 3. cap. 25.  Eddius, Sec.  12]    Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury, called, in the year 680, a synod  at Hatfield, consisting of all the bishops in Britain [d], where was  accepted and ratified the decree of the Lateran council, summoned by  Martin, against the heresy of the Monothelites.  The council and synod  maintained, in opposition to these heretics, that though the divine  and human nature in Christ made but one person, yet they had different  inclinations, wills, acts, and sentiments, and that the unity of the  person implied not unity in "]]]
