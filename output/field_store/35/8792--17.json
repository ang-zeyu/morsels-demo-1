About this time we had arrived near Columbus, where the roads were so  bad, Elder Rigdon's health so poor, and the time so fast approaching  when it was necessary for the committee to be in Washington, that I  started in the stage with Judge Higbee on the most expeditious route to  Washington City, leaving Brothers Rockwell, Rigdon, and Foster, to come  on at their leisure in the carriage.    Elder Brigham Young and company went to Fairport, where they waited for  a steamboat until Tuesday.    Elder Parley P. Pratt and company sold their horses and carriage at  Detroit, and went on to New York City by steamboats, the canal and  railway.    From New York, Elder Parley P. Pratt wrote me on {22} the 22nd,  directed to Commerce, from which I quote the following:        _Excerpt from Parley P. Pratt's Letter to the Prophet_.        The churches in these parts are prospering greatly, and are firm      in the faith, and increasing in numbers continually. The Church in      New York and Brooklyn now numbers from one hundred and fifty to      two hundred members, and additions are being made every week. A      general conference was held in this city on Tuesday and Wednesday      of this week. Elders present: Orson Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, Samuel      James, Benjamin Winchester, Elders Foster, Layne, Jenks, Brown,      Benedict, and myself. Priests present: Addison Everett, Birge, and      Vanvelver. Many branches of the Church in the region round about      were represented; several hundred members in all, and the numbers      still increasing. Great opportunities are open for preaching, and      crowded houses are the order of the day.        I have also received letters from Maine and from Michigan, with      joyful accounts of the spread of the work of the Lord. You would      now find churches of the Saints in Philadelphia, in Albany, in      Brooklyn, in New York, in Jersey, in Pennsylvania, on Long Island,      and in various other places all around us. Our New York meetings      are now held three times every Sabbath in Columbia Hall, Grand      Street, a few doors east of the Bowery; it is very central,      and one of the best places in the city; it will hold nearly a      thousand people, and is well filled with attentive hearers.      Brother Winchester has a good hall well fitted up in Philadelphia,      where stated meetings are held--several every week, with crowded      audiences.        In short the truth is spreading more rapidly than ever before,      in every direction, far and near. There is a great call for our      books. I am now reprinting the Voice of Warning, The History of      the Missouri Persecution, and my Poems. There is a great call for      hymn-books, but none to be had. I wish Sister Smith would add to      the old collection such new ones as is best, and republish them      immediately. If means and facilities are lacking in the west,      send it here, and it shall be nicely done for her; and at least      one thousand would immediately sell in these parts wholesale and      retail. The Book of Mormon is not to be had in this part of the      vineyard for love or money; hundreds are wanting in various parts      hereabouts, but there is truly a famine in that respect.        The conference took into consideration the pressing calls for      this book, and have appointed a committee to raise means for the      publication of the same, and also to publish it if we can obtain      leave from you, who hold the copyright. Any hymn-book which Sister      Smith or the Church will favor us with, shall also be published on      similar conditions.        Parley P. Pratt.    {23} [Sidenote: First Issue of the \"Times and Seasons.\"]    Some time this month the first number of the _Times and Seasons_, a  monthly religious paper, in pamphlet form, was published at Commerce,  Hancock County, Illinois, by my brother Don Carlos Smith and Ebenezer  Robinson, under the firm name of Robinson & Smith, Publishers.    _Tuesday, 26_.--At one in the afternoon, Elder Brigham Young and  company went on board the steamer _Columbus_, at Fairport, and went on  towards Buffalo.    [Sidenote: The Elements Obey.]    _Wednesday, 27._--About 1 o'clock this morning the wind arose, when  Elder Brigham Young went on deck, prayed to the Father in the name of  Jesus, when he felt to command the wind and the waves to cease, and  permit them to proceed on their journey in safety. The winds abated,  and he gave glory, honor, and praise to the God who rules all things.  Arriving in Buffalo in the morning, they took the stage for Batavia.    [Sidenote: The Prophet's Adventure En Route to Washington.]    While on the mountains some distance from Washington, our coachman  stepped into a public house to take his grog, when the horses took  fright and ran down the hill at full speed. I persuaded my fellow  travelers to be quiet and retain their seats, but had to hold one woman  to prevent her throwing her infant out of the coach. The passengers  were exceedingly agitated, but I used every persuasion to calm their  feelings; and opening the door, I secured my hold on the side of the  coach the best way I could, and succeeded in placing myself in the  coachman's seat, and reining up the horses, after they had run some two  or three miles, and neither coach, horses, or passengers received any  injury. My course was spoken of in the highest terms of commendation,  as being one of the most daring and heroic deeds, and no language could  express the gratitude of the passengers, when they found themselves  safe, and the horses quiet. There were some members of Congress with  us, who proposed naming the incident to that body, believing they would  reward such {24} conduct by some public act; but on inquiring my name,  to mention as the author of their safety, and finding it to be Joseph  Smith the \"Mormon Prophet,\" as they called me, I heard no more of their  praise, gratitude, or reward.    _Thursday, 28_.--I arrived in Washington City this morning, and put up  at the corner of Missouri and Third streets.    This evening, Elder Brigham Young and company (except Elder Kimball,  who stopped at Byron to visit his sister) rode to Rochester in the  steam cars, and from thence rode all night in a horse coach, and  arrived at ten in the morning on Friday, 29th, at Auburn, New York.  Elders Taylor and Turley proceeded on their way to New York.    The following is a copy of our petition to Congress for redress of our  Missouri grievances:        The Saint's Petition to Congress.        _To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America, in Congress assembled_:        Your petitioners, Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, and Elias Higbee,      would most respectfully represent, that they have been delegated,      by their brethren and fellow-citizens, known as \"Latter-day      Saints\" (commonly called Mormons), to prepare and present to you      a statement of their wrongs, and a prayer for their relief, which      they now have the honor to submit to the consideration of your      Honorable Body.        In the summer of 1831, a portion of the society above-named      commenced a settlement in the county of Jackson, in the state of      Missouri. The individuals making that settlement had emigrated from      almost every state in the Union to the lovely spot in the Far West,      with the hope of improving their condition, of building houses      for themselves and posterity, and of erecting temples, where they      and theirs might worship their Creator according to the dictates      of their conscience. Though they had wandered far from the homes      of their childhood, still they had been taught to believe, that a      citizen born in any one state in this great Republic, might remove      to another and enjoy all the rights and immunities of citizens of      the state of his adoption--that wherever waved the American flag,      beneath its stars and stripes an American citizen might look for      protection and justice, for liberty in person and in conscience.        {25} They bought farms, built houses, and erected churches. Some      tilled the earth, others bought and sold merchandise, and others      again toiled as mechanics. They were industrious and moral, and      they prospered, and though often persecuted and vilified for their      difference in religious opinion from their fellow citizens, they      were happy; they saw their society increasing in numbers, their      farms teemed with plenty, and they fondly looked forward to a      future, big with hope. That there was prejudice against them, they      knew; that slanders were propagated against them, they deplored;      yet they felt that these were unjust; and hoped that time, and      uprightness of life, would enable them to outlive them. While      the summer of peace, happiness, and hope shone over the infant      settlement of the Saints, the cloud was gathering, unseen by them,      that bore in its bosom the thunderbolt of destruction.        On the 20th of July, 1833, around their peaceful village a mob      gathered, to the surprise and terror of the quiet \"Mormons\"--why,      they knew not; they had broken no law, they had harmed no man, in      deed or thought. Why they were thus threatened, they knew not.      Soon a committee from the mob called upon the leading \"Mormons\"      of the place; they announced that the store, the printing office,      and the shops must be closed, and that forthwith every \"Mormon\"      must leave the county. The message was so terrible, so unexpected,      that the \"Mormons\" asked time for deliberation and consultation,      which being refused, the brethren were severally asked, \"Are you      willing to abandon your home?\" The reply was, \"We will not go;\"      which determination being reported to the committee of the mob,      one of them replied that he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60736"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 5 (#15)"],[1,"   observance of this commandment, is evident; for you yourselves know      that this is that which was spoken by the Lord, in the parable      of the tares of the field, who promised, that in the harvest he      would say to the servant \"gather the wheat into my barn;\" the      signs of the times proclaim this--the end of the world; and thus      admonish us to the performance of this duty. \"Yet notwithstanding      the Spirit testifieth of these things, and you desire with great      anxiety to gather with the Saints; yet are many of you hindered      even to this day;\" so that _to will_ to obey the commandment is      present; but how to perform, you find not. Feeling, therefore, the      {16} responsibility binding on you to observe the statutes and      commandments of the Lord, and living in the midst of a generation      that are ignorant of what the mind of the Lord is concerning His      people, and of the things that belong to their peace; we are well      aware of the embarrassments under which many of you labor in      endeavoring to obey the laws pertaining to your salvation. It is      then no marvel that in this day when darkness covers the earth, and      gross darkness the people, that this generation who know not the      day of their visitation, nor the dispensation of the fullness of      times in which they live, should mock at the gathering together of      the Saints for salvation, as did the antediluvians at the mighty      work of righteous Noah, in building an ark in the midst of the      land, for the salvation of his home by water; seeing then that such      \"blindness hath happened to the Gentile world, which to them is an      evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation,\" and that of      God, think it not strange that you should have to pass through the      like afflictions which all your brethren the saints in all ages      have done before you; to be reviled, persecuted, and hated of all      men, for the name of Christ and the Gospel's sake, is the portion      which all saints have had to partake, who have gone before you. You      then can expect no better things than that there be men of corrupt      minds, reprobate concerning the truth, who will evil entreat you,      and unjustly despoil you of your property and embarrass you in      pecuniary matters, and render it the more difficult to obey the      command to gather with the Saints; pretending to do God's service,      \"whose judgment now lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth      not.\"        But, brethren, with all these considerations before you, in      relation to your afflictions, we think it expedient to admonish      you, that you bear, and forbear, as becometh Saints, and having      done all that is lawful and right, to obtain justice of those that      injure you, wherein you come short of obtaining it, commit the      residue to the just judgment of God, and shake off the dust of your      feet as a testimony of having done so.        Finally, brethren, as it is reported unto us, that there be      some who have not done that which is lawful and right, but have      designedly done injury to their neighbor or creditor by fraud, or      otherwise, thinking to find protection with us in such iniquity;      let all such be warned and certified, that with them we have no      fellowship, when known to be such, until all reasonable measures      are taken to make just restitution to those unjustly injured. Now,      therefore, let this epistle be read in all the branches of the      Church, as testimony, that as representatives thereof, we have      taken righteousness for the girdle of our loins, and faithfulness      for the girdle of our reins, \"and that for Zion's sake we will not      rest; and for Jerusalem's sake we will not hold our peace, until      the {17} righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the      salvation thereof, as a lamp that burneth.\"        Your brethren and servants in the kingdom and patience of Jesus.

ACTIONS IN RELATION TO JOHN C. BENNETT ET AL.--THE PROPHET'S  INSTRUCTIONS TO THE RELIEF SOCIETY--TREATISE ON THE \"HOLY  GHOST\"--WILLIAM LAW'S DEFENSE OF THE SAINTS--THE PROPHET'S ADDRESS TO  THE CHURCH.    _Monday, May 23, 1842_.--I called a special session of the city  council, at which Dimick B. Huntington was elected coroner of the city  of Nauvoo.    [Sidenote: The Fall of Chauncey L. Higbee.]    _Tuesday, 24_.--Chauncey L. Higbee was cut off from the Church by the  High Council, for unchaste and unvirtuous conduct towards certain  females, and for teaching it was right, if kept secret, &c. He was also  put under $200 bonds to keep the peace, on my complaint against him for  slander, before Ebenezer Robinson, justice of the peace.    _Wednesday, 25_.--I spent the day in counseling the Bishops, and  assisting them to expose iniquity.    Notice was this day given to John C. Bennett, that the First  Presidency, Twelve, and Bishops had withdrawn fellowship from him, and  were about to publish him in the paper, but on his humbling himself,  and begging we would spare him from the paper, for his mother's sake,  the notice was withdrawn from the paper.    [Sidenote: Confessions of John C. Bennett.]    _Thursday, 26_.--This forenoon I attended a meeting of nearly a hundred  of the brethren in the Lodge Room, to whom John C. Bennett acknowledged  his wicked and licentious conduct toward certain females in Nauvoo,  and that he was worthy of the severest chastisements, and cried like a  {19} child, and begged that he might be spared, in any possible way; so  deep was his apparent sense of his guilt and unfitness for respectable  society; so deeply did he feign, or really feel contrition for the  moment, that he was forgiven still. I plead for mercy for him.    [Sidenote: The Prophet's Political Attitude.]    At one p. m. I attended a large and respectable meeting of the citizens  of Nauvoo, near the Temple, and addressed them on the principles of  government, at considerable length, showing that I did not intend to  vote the Whig or Democratic ticket as such, but would go for those who  would support good order, &c.    The meeting nominated candidates for senators, representatives, and  other officers, and expressed their entire disapprobation of the  _Quincy Whig_, relative to my being concerned against Governor Boggs.    I met with the Ladies' Relief Society, and gave them a short address; a  synopsis was reported by Miss E. R. Snow.    _Address of the Prophet to the Relief Society_.        President Joseph Smith read the 14th chapter of Ezekiel--said the      Lord had declared by the Prophet, that the people should each one      stand for himself, and depend on no man or men in that state of      corruption of the Jewish church--that righteous persons could only      deliver their own souls--applied it to the present state of the      Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--said if the people      departed from the Lord, they must fall--that they were depending on      the Prophet, hence were darkened in their minds, in consequence of      neglecting the duties devolving upon themselves, envious towards      the innocent, while they afflict the virtuous with their shafts of      envy.        There is another error which opens a door for the adversary to      enter. As females possess refined feelings and sensitiveness, they      are also subject to overmuch zeal, which must ever prove dangerous,      and cause them to be rigid in a religious capacity--[they] should      be armed with mercy, notwithstanding the iniquity among us.        Said he had been instrumental in bringing iniquity to light--it was      a melancholy thought and awful that so many should place themselves      under the condemnation of the devil, and going to perdition.      With {20} deep feeling he said that they are fellow mortals, we      loved them once, shall we not encourage them to reformation? We      have not [yet] forgiven them seventy times seven, as our Savior      directed; perhaps we have not forgiven them once. There is now      a day of salvation to such as repent and reform;--and they who      repent not should be cast out from this society; yet we should woo      them to return to God, lest they escape not the damnation of hell!      Where there is a mountain top, there is also a valley--we should      act in all things on a proper medium to every immortal spirit.      Notwithstanding the unworthy are among us, the virtuous should      not, from self importance, grieve and oppress needlessly, those      unfortunate ones--even these should be encouraged to hereafter live      to be honored by this society, who are the best portions of the      community. Said he had two things to recommend to the members of      this society, to put a double watch over the tongue: no organized      body can exist without this at all. All organized bodies have their      peculiar evils, weaknesses and difficulties, the object is to make      those not so good reform and return to the path of virtue that they      may be numbered with the good, and even hold the keys of power,      which will influence to virtue and goodness--should chasten and      reprove, and keep it all in silence, not even mention them again;      then you will be established in power, virtue, and holiness, and      the wrath of God will be turned away.        I have one request to make of the President and members of the      society, that you search yourselves--the tongue is"]]]
