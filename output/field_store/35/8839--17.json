[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],[0,"While the Billy Boils (#15)"],[1,"stood up, stretched himself, and looked dolefully from his  heavy swag to the wide, hot, shadeless cotton-bush plain ahead.    \"Oh, yes,\" he yawned, \"I stopped at home for a week, and then they began  to growl because I couldn't get any work to do.\"    The mate guffawed and Mitchell grinned. They shouldered the swags, with  the pup on top of Mitchell's, took up their billies and water-bags,  turned their unshaven faces to the wide, hazy distance, and left the  timber behind them.          IN A DRY SEASON      Draw a wire fence and a few ragged gums, and add some scattered sheep  running away from the train. Then you'll have the bush all along the New  South Wales western line from Bathurst on.    The railway towns consist of a public house and a general store, with a  square tank and a school-house on piles in the nearer distance. The tank  stands at the end of the school and is not many times smaller than the  building itself. It is safe to call the pub \"The Railway Hotel,\" and the  store \"The Railway Stores,\" with an \"s.\" A couple of patient, ungroomed  hacks are probably standing outside the pub, while their masters  are inside having a drink--several drinks. Also it's safe to draw a  sundowner sitting listlessly on a bench on the veranda, reading the  _Bulletin_. The Railway Stores seem to exist only in the shadow of the  pub, and it is impossible to conceive either as being independent of  the other. There is sometimes a small, oblong weather-board  building--unpainted, and generally leaning in one of the eight possible  directions, and perhaps with a twist in another--which, from its  half-obliterated sign, seems to have started as a rival to the Railway  Stores; but the shutters are up and the place empty.    The only town I saw that differed much from the above consisted of a  box-bark humpy with a clay chimney, and a woman standing at the door  throwing out the wash-up water.    By way of variety, the artist might make a water-colour sketch of a  fettler's tent on the line, with a billy hanging over the fire in front,  and three fettlers standing round filling their pipes.    Slop sac suits, red faces, and old-fashioned, flat-brimmed hats, with  wire round the brims, begin to drop into the train on the other side of  Bathurst; and here and there a hat with three inches of crape round the  crown, which perhaps signifies death in the family at some remote date,  and perhaps doesn't. Sometimes, I believe, it only means grease under  the band. I notice that when a bushman puts crape round his hat he  generally leaves it there till the hat wears out, or another friend  dies. In the latter case, he buys a new piece of crape. This outward  sign of bereavement usually has a jolly red face beneath it. Death is  about the only cheerful thing in the bush.    We crossed the Macquarie--a narrow, muddy gutter with a dog swimming  across, and three goats interested.    A little farther on we saw the first sundowner. He carried a Royal  Alfred, and had a billy in one hand and a stick in the other. He was  dressed in a tail-coat turned yellow, a print shirt, and a pair of  moleskin trousers, with big square calico patches on the knees; and his  old straw hat was covered with calico. Suddenly he slipped his swag,  dropped his billy, and ran forward, boldly flourishing the stick. I  thought that he was mad, and was about to attack the train, but he  wasn't; he was only killing a snake. I didn't have time to see whether  he cooked the snake or not--perhaps he only thought of Adam.    Somebody told me that the country was very dry on the other side of  Nevertire. It is. I wouldn't like to sit down on it any where. The  least horrible spot in the bush, in a dry season, is where the bush  isn't--where it has been cleared away and a green crop is trying to  grow. They talk of settling people on the land! Better settle _in_ it.  I'd rather settle on the water; at least, until some gigantic system of  irrigation is perfected in the West.    Along about Byrock we saw the first shearers. They dress like the  unemployed, but differ from that body in their looks of independence.  They sat on trucks and wool-bales and the fence, watching the train,  and hailed Bill, and Jim, and Tom, and asked how those individuals were  getting on.    Here we came across soft felt hats with straps round the crowns, and  full-bearded faces under them. Also a splendid-looking black tracker in  a masher uniform and a pair of Wellington boots.    One or two square-cuts and stand-up collars struggle dismally through to  the bitter end. Often a member of the unemployed starts cheerfully  out, with a letter from the Government Labour Bureau in his pocket, and  nothing else. He has an idea that the station where he has the job will  be within easy walking distance of Bourke. Perhaps he thinks there'll  be a cart or a buggy waiting for him. He travels for a night and day  without a bite to eat, and, on arrival, he finds that the station is  eighty or a hundred miles away. Then he has to explain matters to  a publican and a coach-driver. God bless the publican and the  coach-driver! God forgive our social system!    Native industry was represented at one place along the line by three  tiles, a chimney-pot, and a length of piping on a slab.    Somebody said to me, \"Yer wanter go out back, young man, if yer wanter  see the country. Yer wanter get away from the line.\" I don't wanter;  I've been there.    You could go to the brink of eternity so far as Australia is concerned  and yet meet an animated mummy of a swagman who will talk of going \"out  back.\" Out upon the out-back fiend!    About Byrock we met the bush liar in all his glory. He was dressed  like--like a bush larrikin. His name was Jim. He had been to a ball  where some blank had \"touched\" his blanky overcoat. The overcoat had  a cheque for ten \"quid\" in the pocket. He didn't seem to feel the  loss much. \"Wot's ten quid?\" He'd been everywhere, including the Gulf  country. He still had three or four sheds to go to. He had telegrams in  his pocket from half a dozen squatters and supers offering him pens on  any terms. He didn't give a blank whether he took them or no. He thought  at first he had the telegrams on him but found that he had left them  in the pocket of the overcoat aforesaid. He had learned butchering in a  day. He was a bit of a scrapper himself and talked a lot about the ring.  At the last station where he shore he gave the super the father of a  hiding. The super was a big chap, about six-foot-three, and had knocked  out Paddy Somebody in one round. He worked with a man who shore four  hundred sheep in nine hours.    Here a quiet-looking bushman in a corner of the carriage grew restless,  and presently he opened his mouth and took the liar down in about three  minutes.    At 5.30 we saw a long line of camels moving out across the sunset.  There's something snaky about camels. They remind me of turtles and  goannas.    Somebody said, \"Here's Bourke.\"          HE'D COME BACK      The yarn was all lies, I suppose; but it wasn't bad. A city bushman told  it, of course, and he told it in the travellers' hut.    \"As true's God hears me I never meant to desert her in cold blood,\" he  said. \"We'd only been married about two years, and we'd got along grand  together; but times was hard, and I had to jump at the first chance of a  job, and leave her with her people, an' go up-country.\"    He paused and fumbled with his pipe until all ears were brought to bear  on him.    \"She was a beauty, and no mistake; she was far too good for me--I often  wondered how she came to have a chap like me.\"    He paused again, and the others thought over it--and wondered too,  perhaps.    The joker opened his lips to speak, but altered his mind about it.    \"Well, I travelled up into Queensland, and worked back into Victoria 'n'  South Australia, an' I wrote home pretty reg'lar and sent what money  I could. Last I got down on to the south-western coast of South  Australia--an' there I got mixed up with another woman--you know what  that means, boys?\"    Sympathetic silence.    \"Well, this went on for two years, and then the other woman drove me to  drink. You know what a woman can do when the devil's in her?\"    Sound between a sigh and a groan from Lally Thompson. \"My oath,\" he  said, sadly.    \"You should have made it _three_ years, Jack,\" interposed the joker;  \"you said two years before.\" But he was suppressed.    \"Well, I got free of them both, at last--drink and the woman, I  mean; but it took another--it took a couple of years to pull myself  straight--\"    Here the joker opened his mouth again, but was warmly requested to shut  it.    \"Then, chaps, I got thinking. My conscience began to hurt me, and--and  hurt worse every day. It nearly drove me to drink again. Ah, boys, a  man--if he is a man--can't expect to wrong a woman and escape scot-free  in the end.\" (Sigh from Lally Thompson.) \"It's the one thing that always  comes home to a man, sooner or later--you know what that means, boys.\"    Lally Thompson: \"My oath!\"    The joker: \"Dry up yer crimson oath! What do you know about women?\"    Cries of \"Order!\"    \"Well,\" continued the story-teller, \"I got thinking. I heard that my  wife had broken her heart when I left her, and that made matters worse.  I began to feel very bad about it. I felt mean. I felt disgusted with  myself. I pictured my poor, ill-treated, little wife and children in  misery and poverty, and my conscience wouldn't let me rest night or  day\"--(Lally Thompson seemed greatly moved)--\"so at last I made up my  mind to be a man, and make--what's the word?\"    \"Reparation,\" suggested the joker.    \"Yes, so I slaved like a nigger for a year or so, got a few pounds  together and went to find my wife. I found out that she was living in  a cottage in Burwood, Sydney, and struggling through the winter on what  she'd saved from the money her father left her.    \"I got a shave and dressed up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7188"],[0,"Higher Lessons in English: A work on English grammar and composition (#15)"],[1,"===============          |    Explanation.--_To_, in each of these phrases, shows no relation--it serves  merely to introduce. The complements _good_ and _great_ are adjectives used  abstractly, having no noun to relate to.    11. To bear our fate is to conquer it.  12. To be entirely just in our estimate of others is impossible.  13. The noblest vengeance is to forgive.  14. He seemed to be innocent.    +Explanation+.--The infinitive phrase here performs the office of an  adjective. _To be innocent = innocent_.    15. The blind men's dogs appeared to know him.  16. We should learn to govern ourselves.    +Explanation+.--The infinitive phrase is here used as an object complement.    17. Each hill attempts to ape her voice.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 41.    INFINITIVES--CONTINUED.    Analysis.    The +infinitive phrase+ may be used +after a preposition+ as the +principal  term+ of another phrase.    1. My friend is about to leave me.                   \\to                  \\ leave | me                   \\-------'----            \\ about    |             \\        / \\              \\-----------------                  |   friend | is \\ / \\  ========|=====================     \\My  |    +Explanation+.--The preposition _about_ introduces the phrase used as  attribute complement; the principal part is the infinitive phrase _to leave  me_.    2. Paul was now about to open his mouth.  3. No way remains but to go on.    +Explanation+.--_But_ is here a preposition.    The +infinitive+ and its +assumed subject+ may form the +principal term+ in  a phrase introduced by the preposition +for+.    4. For us to know our faults is profitable.              us          -------            |   \\to    \\       |    \\ know  | faults     \\For   |     \\------'--------      \\    / \\               \\our       \\-------           |          / \\  |  is  \\  profitable  =============|======================               |    +Explanation+.--_For_ introduces the subject phrase; the principal part of  the entire phrase is _us to know our faults;_ the principal word is _us_,  which is modified by the phrase _to know our faults_.    5. God never made his work for man to mend.    +Explanation+.---The principal term of the phrase _for man to mend_ is not  _man_, but _man to mend_.    6. For a man to be proud of his learning is the greatest ignorance.    The +infinitive phrase+ may be used as an +explanatory modifier.+    7. It is easy to find fault.      \\to   \\ find | fault    \\-----'------       |  It (/ \\) | is \\ easy  =========|===========           |    +Explanation+.--The infinitive phrase _to find fault_ explains the subject  _it_. Read the sentence without _it_, and you will see the real nature of  the phrase. This use of _it_ as a substitute for the real subject is a very  common idiom of our language. It allows the real subject to follow the  verb, and thus gives the sentence balance of parts.    8. It is not the way to argue down a vice to tell lies about it.  9. It is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.  10. It is not all of life to live.  11. This task, to teach the young, may become delightful.    The +infinitive phrase+ may be used as +objective complement.+    12. He made me wait.    +Explanation+.--The infinitive _wait_ (here used without _to_) completes  _made_ and relates to _me_. _He made-wait me = He detained me_.    See \"Introductory Hints,\" Lesson 31, and participles used as objective  complements, Lesson 37. Compare _I saw him do it_ with _I saw him doing  it_. Compare also _He made the stick bend_--equaling _He made-bend _(=  bent) _the stick_--with _He made the stick straight_--equaling _He  made-straight _(= straightened) _the stick_.    The relation of these objective complements to _me, him_, and _stick_ may  be more clearly seen by changing the form of the verb, thus: I was made _to  wait_; He was seen _to do it_, He was seen _doing it_; The stick was made  _to bend_; The stick was made _straight_.    13.We found the report to be true. [Footnote: Some prefer to treat _the     report to be true_ as an object clause because it is equivalent to the     clause _that the report is true_. But many expressions logically     equivalent are entirely different in grammatical construction; as, I     desire _his promotion_; I desire _him to be promoted_; I desire _that he     should be promoted_. Besides, to teach that _him_ is the subject, and     _to be promoted_ the predicate, of a     clause would certainly be confusing.]            \\to           \\ be    \\ true            \\--------------                  |  We | found  /  / \\  |  report  ===|==========================     |    14. He commanded the bridge to be lowered. [Footnote: Notice the difference      in construction between this sentence and the sentence _He commanded      him to lower the bridge_. _Him_ represents the one to whom the command      is given, and _to lower the bridge_ is the object complement. This last      sentence = He commanded _him that he should lower the bridge_. Compare      _He told me to go_ with _He told (to) me a story_; also _He taught me      to read_ with _He taught (to) me reading._ In such sentences as (13)      and (14) it may not always be expedient to demand that the pupil shall      trace the exact relations of the infinitive phrase to the preceding      noun and to the predicate verb. If preferred, in such cases, the      infinitive and its assumed subject may be treated as a kind of phrase      object, equivalent to a clause. This construction is similar to the      Latin \"accusative with the infinitive.\"]    15. I saw the leaves stir. [Footnote: See pages 68 and 69, foot-note.]    +Explanation+.--_Stir_ is an infinitive without the _to_.    16. Being persuaded by Poppaesa, Hero caused his mother, Agrippina, to be      assassinated.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 42.    INFINITIVES--CONTINUED.    Analysis.    The +infinitive phrase+ may be used +independently+. [Footnote: These  infinitive phrases can be expanded into dependent clauses. See Lesson 79.    For the infinitive after _as, than_, etc., see Lesson 63. Participles and  infinitives unite with other verbs to make compound forms; as, have  _walked_, shall _walk_.]    +Explanation+.--In the diagram the independent element must stand by  itself.    1. England's debt, to put it in round numbers, is $4,000,000,000.  2. Every object has several faces, so to speak.  3. To make a long story short, Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette were     executed.    Infinitives and Participles.    MISCELLANEOUS.    4. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord.  5. We require clothing in the summer to protect the body from the heat of     the sun.  6. Rip Van Winkle could not account for everything's having changed so.  7. This sentence is not too difficult for me to analyze.  8. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole,  9. Conscience, her first law broken, wounded lies.  10. To be, or not to be,--that is the question.  11. I supposed him to be a gentleman.  12. Food, keeping the body in health by making it warm and repairing its      waste, is a necessity.  13. I will teach you the trick to prevent your being cheated another time.  14. She threatened to go beyond the sea, to throw herself out of the      window, to drown herself.  15. Busied with public affairs, the council would sit for hours smoking and      watching the smoke curl from their pipes to the ceiling.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 43.    COMPOSITION--THE INFINITIVE.    +Direction+.--_Change the infinitives in these sentences into participles,  and the participles into infinitives_:--    Notice that _to_, the only preposition used with the infinitive, is changed  to _toward, for, of, at, in,_ or _on_, when the infinitive is changed to a  participle.    1. I am inclined to believe it.  2. I am ashamed to be seen there.  3. She will be grieved to hear it.  4. They trembled to hear such words.  5. It will serve for amusing the children.  6. There is a time to laugh.  7. I rejoice to hear it.  8. You are prompt to obey.  9. They delight to do it.  10. I am surprised at seeing you.  11. Stones are used in ballasting vessels.    +Direction+.--_Improve these sentences by changing the participles into  infinitives, and the infinitives into participles_:--    1. We began ascending the mountain.  2. He did not recollect to have paid it.  3. I commenced to write a letter.  4. It is inconvenient being poor.  5. It is not wise complaining.    +Direction+.--_Vary these sentences as in the model_:--    +Model+.--_Rising early_ is healthful; _To rise_ early is healthful; _It_  is healthful _to rise_ early; _For one to rise_ early is healthful.    (Notice that the explanatory phrase after _it_ is not set off by the  comma.)    1. Reading good books is profitable.  2. Equivocating is disgraceful.  3. Slandering is base.  4. Indorsing another's paper is dangerous.  5. Swearing is sinful.    +Direction.+--_Write nine sentences, in three of which the infinitive  phrase shall be used as an adjective, in three as an adverb, and in three  as a noun_.    +Direction.+--_Write eight sentences in which these verbs shall be followed  by an infinitive without the to_:--    +Model.+--We _saw_ the sun _sink_ behind the mountain.    Bid, dare, feel, hear, let, make, need, and see.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 44.    WORDS AND PHRASES USED INDEPENDENTLY.    +Introductory Hints.+--In this Lesson we wish to notice words and phrases  that in certain uses have no grammatical connection with the rest of the  sentence.    _The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars. Dear Brutus_ serves only to  arrest attention, and is independent by address.    _Poor man! he never came back again. Poor man_ is independent by  exclamation.    _Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me_. _Rod_ and _staff_ simply call  attention to the objects before anything is said of"]]]
