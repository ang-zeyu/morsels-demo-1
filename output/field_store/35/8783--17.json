Tell them that I know that  Agnes de Lucines loathes me, that I know that she loves him. I know that  I cannot win her save by threatening him. But you are wrong, citizen  Lepine,\" he continued, speaking more and more calmly as his passions of  hatred and of love seemed more and more to hold him in their grip; \"you  are wrong if you think that she will not strike a bargain with me in  order to save the life of Fabrice, whom she loves. Agnes de Lucines will  be my wife within the month, or Arnould Fabrice's head will fall under  the guillotine, and you, my interfering friend, may go to the devil, if  you please.\"    \"That would be but a tame proceeding, citizen, after my visit to you,\"  said the old man, with unruffled sang-froid. \"But let me, in my turn,  assure you of this, citizen Heriot,\" he added, \"that Mlle. de Lucines  will never be your wife, that Arnould Fabrice will not end his valuable  life under the guillotine--and that you will never be allowed to use  against him the cowardly and stolen weapon which you possess.\"    Heriot laughed--a low, cynical laugh and shrugged his thin shoulders:    \"And who will prevent me, I pray you?\" he asked sarcastically.    The old man made no immediate reply, but he came just a step or two  closer to the citizen-deputy and, suddenly drawing himself up to his  full height, he looked for one brief moment down upon the mean and  sordid figure of the ex-valet. To Heriot it seemed as if the whole man  had become transfigured; the shabby old scarecrow looked all of a sudden  like a brilliant and powerful personality; from his eyes there flashed  down a look of supreme contempt and of supreme pride, and Heriot--unable  to understand this metamorphosis which was more apparent to his inner  consciousness than to his outward sight, felt his knees shake under him  and all the blood rush back to his heart in an agony of superstitious  terror.    From somewhere there came to his ear the sound of two words: \"I will!\"  in reply to his own defiant query. Surely those words uttered by a man  conscious of power and of strength could never have been spoken by the  dilapidated old scarecrow who earned a precarious living by writing  letters for ignorant folk.    But before he could recover some semblance of presence of mind citizen  Lepine had gone, and only a loud and merry laugh seemed to echo through  the squalid room.    Heriot shook off the remnant of his own senseless terror; he tore open  the door of the bedroom and shouted to Rondeau, who truly was thinking  that the citizen-deputy had gone mad:    \"After him!--after him! Quick! curse you!\" he cried.    \"After whom?\" gasped the man.    \"The man who was here just now--an aristo.\"    \"I saw no one--but the Public Letter-Writer, old Lepine--I know him  well---\"    \"Curse you for a fool!\" shouted Heriot savagely, \"the man who was here  was that cursed Englishman--the one whom they call the Scarlet  Pimpernel. Run after him--stop him, I say!\"    \"Too late, citizen,\" said the other placidly; \"whoever was here before  is certainly half-way down the street by now.\"      III    \"No use, Ffoulkes,\" said Sir Percy Blakeney to his friend half-an-hour  later, \"the man's passions of hatred and desire are greater than his  greed.\"    The two men were sitting together in one of Sir Percy Blakeney's many  lodgings--the one in the Rue des Petits Peres--and Sir Percy had just  put Sir Andrew Ffoulkes au fait with the whole sad story of Arnould  Fabrice's danger and Agnes de Lucines' despair.    \"You could do nothing with the brute, then?\" queried Sir Andrew.    \"Nothing,\" replied Blakeney. \"He refused all bribes, and violence would  not have helped me, for what I wanted was not to knock him down, but to  get hold of the letters.\"    \"Well, after all, he might have sold you the letters and then denounced  Fabrice just the same.\"    \"No, without actual proofs he could not do that. Arnould Fabrice is not  a man against whom a mere denunciation would suffice. He has the  grudging respect of every faction in the National Assembly. Nothing but  irrefutable proof would prevail against him--and bring him to the  guillotine.\"    \"Why not get Fabrice and Mlle. de Lucines safely over to England?\"    \"Fabrice would not come. He is not of the stuff that emigres are made  of. He is not an aristocrat; he is a republican by conviction, and a  demmed honest one at that. He would scorn to run away, and Agnes de  Lucines would not go without him.\"    \"Then what can we do?\"    \"Filch those letters from that brute Heriot,\" said Blakeney calmly.    \"House-breaking, you mean!\" commented Sir Andrew Ffoulkes dryly.    \"Petty theft, shall we say?\" retorted Sir Percy. \"I can bribe the lout  who has charge of Heriot's rooms to introduce us into his master's  sanctum this evening when the National Assembly is sitting and the  citizen-deputy safely out of the way.\"    And the two men--one of whom was the most intimate friend of the Prince  of Wales and the acknowledged darling of London society--thereupon fell  to discussing plans for surreptitiously entering a man's room and  committing larceny, which in normal times would entail, if discovered, a  long term of imprisonment, but which, in these days, in Paris, and  perpetrated against a member of the National Assembly, would certainly  be punished by death.      IV    Citizen Rondeau, whose business it was to look after the creature  comforts of deputy Heriot, was standing in the antichambre facing the  two visitors whom he had just introduced into his master's apartments,  and idly turning a couple of gold coins over and over between his grimy  fingers.    \"And mind, you are to see nothing and hear nothing of what goes on in  the next room,\" said the taller of the two strangers; \"and when we go  there'll be another couple of louis for you. Is that understood?\"    \"Yes! it's understood,\" grunted Rondeau sullenly; \"but I am running  great risks. The citizen-deputy sometimes returns at ten o'clock, but  sometimes at nine.... I never know.\"    \"It is now seven,\" rejoined the other; \"we'll be gone long before nine.\"    \"Well,\" said Rondeau surlily, \"I go out now for my supper. I'll return  in half an hour, but at half-past eight you must clear out.\"    Then he added with a sneer:    \"Citizens Legros and Desgas usually come back with deputy Heriot of  nights, and citizens Jeanniot and Bompard come in from next door for a  game of cards. You wouldn't stand much chance if you were caught here.\"    \"Not with you to back up so formidable a quintette of stalwarts,\"  assented the tall visitor gaily. \"But we won't trouble about that just  now. We have a couple of hours before us in which to do all that we  want. So au revoir, friend Rondeau ... two more louis for your  complaisance, remember, when we have accomplished our purpose.\"    Rondeau muttered something more, but the two strangers paid no further  heed to him; they had already walked to the next room, leaving Rondeau  in the antichambre.    Sir Percy Blakeney did not pause in the sitting-room where an oil lamp  suspended from the ceiling threw a feeble circle of light above the  centre table. He went straight through to the bedroom. Here, too, a  small lamp was burning which only lit up a small portion of the  room--the writing-desk and the oak chest--leaving the corners and the  alcove, with its partially drawn curtains, in complete shadow.    Blakeney pointed to the oak chest and to the desk.    \"You tackle the chest, Ffoulkes, and I will go for the desk,\" he said  quietly, as soon as he had taken a rapid survey of the room. \"You have  your tools?\"    Ffoulkes nodded, and anon in this squalid room, ill-lit, ill-ventilated,  barely furnished, was presented one of the most curious spectacles of  these strange and troublous times: two English gentlemen, the  acknowledged dandies of London drawing-rooms, busy picking locks and  filing hinges like any common house-thieves.    Neither of them spoke, and a strange hush fell over the room--a hush  only broken by the click of metal against metal, and the deep breathing  of the two men bending to their task. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes was working  with a file on the padlocks of the oak chest, and Sir Percy Blakeney,  with a bunch of skeleton keys, was opening the drawers of the  writing-desk. These, when finally opened, revealed nothing of any  importance; but when anon Sir Andrew was able to lift the lid of the oak  chest, he disclosed an innumerable quantity of papers and documents tied  up in neat bundles, docketed and piled up in rows and tiers to the very  top of the chest.    \"Quick to work, Ffoulkes,\" said Blakeney, as in response to his friend's  call he drew a chair forward and, seating himself beside the chest,  started on the task of looking through the hundreds of bundles which lay  before him. \"It will take us all our time to look through these.\"    Together now the two men set to work--methodically and quietly--piling  up on the floor beside them the bundles of papers which they had already  examined, and delving into the oak chest for others. No sound was heard  save the crackling of crisp paper and an occasional ejaculation from  either of them when they came upon some proof or other of Heriot's  propensity for blackmail.    \"Agnes de Lucines is not the only one whom this brute is terrorising,\"  murmured Blakeney once between his teeth; \"I marvel that the man ever  feels safe, alone in these lodgings, with no one but that weak-kneed  Rondeau to protect him. He must have scores of enemies in this city who  would gladly put a dagger in his heart or a bullet through his back.\"    They had been at work for close on half an hour when an exclamation of  triumph, quickly smothered, escaped Sir Percy's lips.    \"By Gad, Ffoulkes!\" he said, \"I believe I have got what we want!\"    With quick, capable hands he turned over a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5817"],[0,"The Clockmaker — or, the Sayings and Doings of Samuel Slick, of Slickville (#15)"],[1," there may be  something wrong in all these things, (and it cant be  otherwise in natur) in Council, Banks, House of Assembly,  and Lawyers: but change them all, and its an even chance  if you don't get worse ones in their room. It is in  politics as in horses; when a man has a beast that's near  about up to the notch, he'd better not swap him; if he  does, he's een amost sure to get one not so good as his  own. My rule is, I'd rather keep a critter whose faults  I do know, than change him for a beast whose faults I  dont know.    No. XV    The Dancing Master Abroad.    I wish that are black heifer in the kitchen would give  over singing that are everlastin dismal tune, said the  Clockmaker, it makes my head ache. You've heerd a song  afore now, said he, hav'nt you, till you was fairly sick  of it? for I have, I vow. The last time I was in Rhode  Island, (all the galls sing there, and its generally  allowed there's no such singers any where; they beat the  EYE-talians a long chalk--they sing so high some on em,  they go clear out o' hearin sometimes, like a lark) well,  you heerd nothin but 'Oh no, we never mention her,' well,  I grew so plaguy tired of it, I used to say to myself,  I'd sooner see it, than heer tell of it, I vow, I wish  to gracious you 'would never mention her,' for it makes  me feel ugly to hear that same thing for ever and ever  and amen that way. Well, they've got a cant phrase here,  'the schoolmaster is abroad,' and every feller tells you  that fifty times a day. There was a chap said to me not  long ago, at Truro, Mr. Slick, this Country is rapidly  improving, 'the schoolmaster is abroad now,' and he looked  as knowin as though he had found a mate's nest. So I  should think, said I, and it would jist be about as well,  I guess, if he'd stay to home and mind his business, for  your folks are so consoomedly ignorant, I reckon he's  abroad een amost all his time. I hope when he returns,  he'll be the better of his travels, and that's more nor  many of our young folks are who go 'abroad,' for they  import more airs and nonsense, than they dispose of one  while, I tell you--some of the stock remains on hand all  the rest of their lives. There's nothin I hate so much  as cant, of all kinds, its a sure sign of a tricky  disposition. If you see a feller cant in religion, clap  your hand into your pocket, and lay right hold of your  puss, or he'll steal it as sure as you're alive; and if  a man cant in politics, he'll sell you if he gets a  chance, you may depend. Law and physic are jist the same,  and every mite and morsel as bad. If a lawyer takes to  cantin, its like the fox preachin to the geese, he'll  eat up his whole congregation; and if a doctor takes to  it, he's a quack as sure as rates. The Lord have massy  on you, for he wont. I'd sooner trust my chance with a  naked hook any time, than one that's half covered with  bad bait. The fish will sometimes swaller the one, without  thinkin, but they get frightened at tother, turn tail  and off like a shot. Now, to change the tune, I'll give  the Blue Noses a new phrase. They'll have an election  most likely next year, and then 'the dancin master will  be abroad.' A candidate is a most particular polite man,  a noddin here, and a bowin there, and a shakin hands all  round. Nothin improves a man's manners like an election.  'The dancin master's abroad then;' nothin gives the paces  equal to that, it makes them as squirmy as an eel, they  cross hands and back agin, set to their partners and  right and left in great style, and slick it off at the  eend, with a real complete bow, and a smile for all the  world as sweet as a cat makes at a pan of new milk. Then  they get as full of compliments as a dog is full of  fleas--enquirin how the old lady is to home, and the  little boy that made such a wonderful smart answer, they  never can forget it till next time; a praisin a man's  farm to the nines, and a tellin of him, how scandalous  the road that leads to his location has been neglected,  and how much he wants to find a real complete hand that  can build a bridge over his brook, and axin him if HE  ever built one. When he gets the hook baited with the  right fly, and the simple critter begins to jump out of  water arter it, all mouth and gills, he winds up the  reel, and takes leave, a thinkin to himself 'now you see  what's to the eend of my line, I guess I'll know where  to find you when I want you.'    There's no sort of fishin requires so much practice as  this. When bait is scarce one worm must answer for several  fish. A handful of oats in a pan, arter it brings one  horse up in a pastur for the bridle, serves for another,  a shakin of it, is better than a givin of it, it saves  the grain for another time. It's a poor business arter  all is electioneering, and when 'the Dancin Master is  abroad,' he's as apt to teach a man to cut capers and  get larfed at as any thing else. It tante every one that's  soople enough to dance real complete. Politicks take a  great deal of time, and grinds away a man's honesty near  about as fast as cleaning a knife with brick dust, 'it  takes its steel out.' What does a critter get arter all  for it in this country, why nothin but expense and  disappointment. As King Solomon says, (and that are man  was up to a thing or two, you may depend, tho' our  professor did say he warn't so knowin as Uncle Sam,) it's  all vanity and vexation of spirit.    I raised a four year old colt once, half blood, a perfect  pictur of a horse, and a genuine clipper, could gallop  like the wind; a real daisy, a perfect doll, had an eye  like a weasel, and nostril like Commodore Rodgers's  speakin trumpet. Well, I took it down to the races at  New York, and father he went along with me; for says he,  Sam, you don't know every thing, I guess, you hant cut  your wisdom teeth yet, and you are goin among them that's  had 'em through their gums this while past. Well, when  we gets to the races, father he gets colt and puts him  in an old waggon, with a worn out Dutch harness, and  breast band; he looked like Old Nick, that's a fact. Then  he fastened a head martingale on, and buckled it to the  girths atwixt his fore legs. Says I, father, what on  airth are you at? I vow I feel ashamed to be seen with  such a catamaran as that, and colt looks like old Saytan  himself--no soul would know him. I guess I warn't born  yesterday, says he, let me be, I know what I am at. I  guess I'll slip it into 'em afore I've done as slick as  a whistle. I guess I can see as far into a mill stone  as the best on 'em. Well, father never entered the horse  at all, but stood by and see'd the races, and the winnin  horse was followed about by the matter of two or three  thousand people, a praisin of him and admirin him. They  seemed as if they never had see'd a horse afore. The  owner of him was all up on eend a boastin of him, and a  stumpin the course to produce a horse to run agin him  for four hundred dollars. Father goes up to him, lookin  as soft as dough, and as meechin as you please, and says  he, friend, it tante every one that has four hundred  dollars--its a plaguy sight of money, I tell you; would  you run for one hundred dollars, and give me a little  start? if you would, I'd try my colt out of my old waggon  agin you, I vow. Let's look at your horse, says he; so  away they went, and a proper sight of people arter them  to look at colt, and when they see'd him they sot up such  a larf, I felt een a most ready to cry for spite. Says  I to myself; what can possess the old man to act arter  that fashion, I do believe he has taken leave of his  senses. You need'nt larf, says Father, he's smarter than  he looks; our Minister's old horse, Captain Jack, is  reckoned as quick a beast of his age as any in our  location, and that are colt can beat him for a lick of  a quarter of a mile quite easy--I see'd it myself. Well,  they larfed agin louder than before, and says father, if  you dispute my word, try me; what odds will you give?  Two to one, says the owner--800 to 400 dollars. Well,  that's a great deal of money, aint it, says father, if  I was to lose it I'd look pretty foolish, would'nt I.  How folks would pass their jokes at me when I went home  again. You would'nt take that are waggon and harness  for fifty dollars of it, would you? says he. Well, says  the other, sooner than disappoint you, as you seem to  have set your mind on losing your money, I don't care if  I do.    As soon as it was settled, father drives off to the  stables, and then returns mounted, with a red silk pocket  handkerchief tied round his head, and colt a looking like  himself as proud as a nabob, chock full of spring like  the wire eend of a bran new pair of trowser galluses--one  said that's a plaguy nice lookin colt that old feller  has arter all, that horse will show play for it yet, says  a third; and I heard one feller say, I guess that's a  regular Yankee trick, a complete take in. They had a  fair start for it, and off they sot, father took the lead  and kept it, and won the race, tho' it was a pretty tight  scratch, for father was too old to ride colt, he was near  about the matter of seventy years old. Well when the colt  was walked round after the race, there was an amasin  crowd arter him, and several wanted to buy him; but, says  father, how am I to get home without him, and what shall  I do with that are waggon and harness so far as I be from  Slickville. So he kept them in talk, till he felt their  pulses pretty well, and at last he closed with a Southerner  for 700 dollars, and we returned, having made a considerable  good spec of colt. Says father to me, Sam says he, you  seed the crowd a follerin the winnin horse, when we came  there, did'nt you? yes Sir, said I, I did. Well, when  colt beat him, no one follered him at all, but come a  crowded about HIM. That's popularity, said he, soon won,  soon lost--cried up sky high one minute, and deserted  the next or"]]]
