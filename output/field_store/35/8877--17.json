The Rheer Hamaturwa had heard of my  intention to journey westwards, and would be in readiness to descend  upon and intercept our march, kill Sumunter, and destroy the whole of  us; indeed, they had sent messages to that effect.                                      Chapter IV.

On my walking amongst the tombs, and inspecting the  crosses[20] at their heads, the interpreter rebuked me for  sacrilegious motives, and desired me to come away, lest the  Dulbahantas should find it out, and be angry with me. Besides this, I  daily tried to draw Sumunter, like a badger, from his hut, which was  four miles distant from my tent, but without effect. He and his wife,  two dwarf sisters (little bits of things, who, the interpreter said,  were too small to be of any use), and some children, all lived  together in a small beehive hut, so low that they had to crawl in on  all-fours, and so small that it was marvellous how they could turn  round in it. At length to-day he arrived in a sullen angry mood, and  said, haughtily, he was displeased at my trying to force him into  compliance, as if I had the power to make him move unless he chose. It  was impossible to keep one's temper under such constant provocation;  so I abused him vehemently, and warned him off the camp, again  repeating he had abused his commission, as well as the Government  authorities who engaged him,--and entreated he would \"get away,\" and  let me take my chance of proceeding how I could, for his presence  simply made my position one of purgatory. He laughed in scorn, wishing  to know if I thought I could do anything without him,--and said he had  only to turn his back an instant, and the Dulbahantas were ready to  devour me. I still persisted; and then he said, \"If you say go once  more, I take you at your word; and see you to the consequences.\"    My resolution was fixed; for I plainly saw I could not by any  possibility be worse off. He now tried frightening me by assembling  the Dulbahantas to confirm his words, making them say they only  permitted my residence there out of the love they bore to their  brother Sumunter, and that they certainly would kill me if he once  left the place. They did not fear guns. The English could not reach  them; besides, their fathers had driven Christians from these lands;  and if an army was to attack them, they would assemble so many  cavalry, and ride in such rapidity around them, that their gunners  could not take aim in consequence of the clouds of dust which this  feat would occasion. In addition to this, they thought the English  only efficacious behind walls; else, why did they not take revenge  upon the Arabs at Lahej, two years ago, for the murder of an officer?  They had often heard of the English threatening and preparing to do  it, but somehow they never carried their intention into execution. I  treated these vain bombastic words with the contempt which they  deserved,--but said, I only wanted Sumunter to take me on, or  otherwise to leave me to my fate. They then tried weakening my party  by bribing Farhan to side with them and leave; but the noble-hearted  Seedi disclosed their treachery, and gallantly said he would share  misfortunes with me, and fight, if necessary, to the last extremity.    Imam, tame-hearted Indian, got in a dreadful fright, and implored I  would compromise the matter; for by this time all the camels had been  driven away; and the Warsingali moved off with Sumunter, saying I  brought the rupture by my obstinacy on my own head, and that as soon  as they were out of sight, the Dulbahantas would walk in and kill us  all in a heap. I then loaded all the guns, and, giving one to each of  the servants, sat on the boxes waiting to see the up-shot. I was  clearly outmanoeuvred--unable to move or get anything--but still was,  to use their own expression, \"obstinate.\" After proceeding a certain  distance, the retiring band, with Sumunter at their head, sitting  fully equipped with spear and shield on his war-steed, came to a halt,  and invited the interpreter to meet them, presuming, they said, there  might be some mistake, and therefore they wished to open negotiations  afresh. Sumunter then gave me back my own words, saying, \"If the Sahib  would only say he wished me to take him to Berbera, I will give some  small presents to the Akils of the Dulbahantas as a passport for him,  and proceed at once;\" for they were only endeavouring to feel my  disposition towards them, and did not intend desertion, if I was not  irredeemably incensed against them. They then came back, and work  began afresh, by the distribution of presents, which, as is usual when  no man can bear to see the smallest trifle slip from his grasp to be  given to another, was a matter of no small difficulty in adjusting. If  the Dulbahantas did not succeed in skinning me of all my effects, they  naturally thought the next tribe would; and a whole day was consumed  in wrangling and disputing how much they should get. This ended by my  giving one musket, thirteen tobes, and my reserve silk turban; and now  I was at liberty to quit Jid Ali.    11th.--At 10 A.M. we were loaded, and commenced the journey westward;  whilst the Abban said he would bid his friends adieu at home, and  bring five horses with him to Biyn Hablé, where he would meet us on  the following day. The track led us across a flat alluvial plain,  still in the valley, which was well covered with a thick growth of  acacias, and dry short grass, nipped short by cattle. After walking  five miles, we arrived at our destination, not far from a well, and  made a ring-fence of prickly boughs.    Here for the last time I boiled the thermometer, to ascertain the  altitude of the plateau along my line of march, and found its average  height was 3913 feet: the minimum, at Rhut Tug, being 3077 feet--and  the maximum, at Yubbé Tug, 4498 feet.    The following day two Dulbahantas paid us a visit, and demanded to  know by whose authority we had come upon their grounds; we were  trespassers, and must pay our footing. The ground was theirs, and they  recognised no authority over them. What I had given at the last place  was no concern of theirs, but I must give them also a quantity of  cloth equivalent to it. This being refused as a preposterous  imposition, they turned hastily away, and, tossing their heads, said,  I might soon expect to see them again in larger numbers, when they  would help themselves. Moreover, for my satisfaction, they could  assure me that a number of men, who had learned which road I was bent  on travelling, were fast gathering on ahead, to oppose my advance. In  the evening the Abban arrived, bringing only two ponies with him.    17th.--It would be needless to recount all the varied incidents of the  next five days which were wasted here, by the thousand and one stories  which the Abban produced to fritter away my time near his home, and  swindle me out of my property. The time had now arrived when by  appointment I should have been at Berbera; and as I was not then aware  at what time the fair usually broke up, I felt much afraid of being  too late to join my companions. Sometimes Sumunter raised my hopes by  saying he would certainly proceed on a certain date; and when that day  arrived, the journey was deferred again, but not without severe rows,  so exactly like the past ones as to be unworthy of description. One  day we were ready, and I was to pass through any people that might  fall in the way by giving large credits on Aden under his security,  when the tide was turned again in another moment by the arrival of  some accomplices, who dropped in like unexpected evils, to say the  southern Dulbahantas had gained a great victory, slaughtering men and  cattle, and the road to Berbera would be thronged with people, so that  advance would be impossible for the present. This was a settler to my  westward march; and now I thought of escaping from this land of  robbers by turning northwards, and marching over the hills to Bunder  Héis, where I could either ship off, or march along the coast to  Berbera.    Negotiations were then set on foot with the Rheer Hamaturwa, and  several of their Akils came at my bidding, but were as implacable  about obliging a stranger as any of their neighbours. The whole  distance was not three days' travel; still they said I should not see  their country, and acknowledged themselves a lawless band, who would  take everything from me if I ventured there: adding, if the Warsingali  and Dulbahantas, who were stronger than themselves, would only  withdraw from me one day, they would come down at once, and demolish  my whole camp. They then demanded cloths for the trouble I had given  them, but, not receiving any, retired in huge disgust.    18th.--In final despair I faced about, and marched north-easterly, by  a new route, to reach Bunder Gori again, to ship for Aden, as there  only could I be certain of finding a vessel to convey me over the  Gulf. After six miles' march across the head of the valley, we arrived  at Mirhiddo Kraal, on elevated ground, and found a large party  assembled there. Some of them were the Rheer Hamaturwa, with whom I  tried again for permission to cross their hills, but this time by the  gap at the head of the valley in front of Bunder Jedid. This they were  ready to permit, and give"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8419"],[0,"The Journals of Lewis and Clark, 1804-1806 (#15)"],[1,"by some one of  their rispective messes; they are exempted also from pitching the tents  of the mess, collecting firewood, and forks poles &c. for cooking and  drying such fresh meat as may be furnished them; those duties are to be  also performed by the other members of the mess.
