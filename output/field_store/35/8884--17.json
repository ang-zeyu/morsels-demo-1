It is surrounded by a high wall, in which are a number of  port-holes, for musketry to fire through; in case of an attack. Every  man's possession is likewise surrounded by a wall; the whole forming so  many distinct citadels; and amongst a people unacquainted with the use of  artillery, these walls answer all the purposes of stronger  fortifications. To the westward of the town is a small river, on the  banks of which the natives raise great plenty of tobacco and onions.    The same evening Madiboo the Bushreen, who had accompanied me from  Pisania, went to pay a visit to his father and mother, who dwelt at a  neighbouring town called Dramanet. He was joined by my other attendant  the blacksmith; and as soon as it was dark, I was invited to see the  sports of the inhabitants, it being their custom, on the arrival of  strangers, to welcome them by diversions of different kinds. I found a  great crowd surrounding a party who were dancing, by the light of some  large fires, to the music of four drums, which were beat with great  exactness and uniformity. The dances, however, consisted more in wanton  gestures than in muscular exertion or graceful attitudes. The ladies vied  with each other in displaying the most voluptuous movements imaginable.    December 25th. About two o'clock in the morning a number of horsemen came  into the town, and having awakened my landlord, talked to him for some  time in the Serawoolli tongue; after which they dismounted, and came to  the Bentang, on which I had made my bed. One of them thinking that I was  asleep, attempted to steal the musket that lay by me on the mat; but  finding that he could not effect his purpose undiscovered, he desisted:  and the strangers sat down by me till daylight.    I could now easily perceive, by the countenance of my interpreter,  Johnson, that something very unpleasant was in agitation. I was likewise  surprised to see Madiboo and the blacksmith so soon returned. On  inquiring the reason, Madiboo informed me that as they were dancing at  Dramanet, ten horsemen, belonging to Batcheri, king of the country, with  his second son at their head, had arrived there, inquiring if the white  man had passed: and on being told that I was at Joag, they rode off  without stopping. Madiboo added, that on hearing this, he and the  blacksmith hastened back to give me notice of their coming. Whilst I was  listening to this narrative, the ten horsemen mentioned by Madiboo  arrived; and coming to the Bentang, dismounted and seated themselves with  those who had come before, the whole being about twenty in number,  forming a circle round me, and each man holding his musket in his hand. I  took this opportunity to observe to my landlord, that as I did not  understand the Serawoolli tongue, I hoped, whatever the men had to say  they would speak in Mandingo. To this they agreed; and a short man,  loaded with a remarkable number of saphies, opened the business in a very  long harangue, informing me that I had entered the king's town without  having first paid the duties, or giving any present to the king, and  that, according to the laws of the country, my people, cattle, and  baggage, were forfeited.  He added, that they had received orders from  the king to conduct me to Maana,[8] the place of his residence; and if I  refused to come with them, their orders were to bring me by force; upon  his saying which, all of them rose up and asked me if I was ready. It  would have been equally vain and imprudent in me to have resisted or  irritated such a body of men; I therefore affected to comply with their  commands, and begged them only to stop a little until I had given my  horse a feed of corn, and settled matters with my landlord. The poor  blacksmith, who was a native of Kasson, mistook this feigned compliance  for a real intention, and taking me away from the company, told me that  he had always behaved towards me as if I had been his father and master;  and he hoped I would not entirely ruin him, by going to Maana; adding,  that as there was every reason to believe a war would soon take place  between Kasson and Kajaaga, he should not only lose his little property,  the savings of four years industry, but should certainly be detained and  sold as a slave, unless his friends had an opportunity of paying two  slaves for his redemption. I saw this reasoning in its full force, and  determined to do my utmost to preserve the blacksmith from so dreadful a  fate. I therefore told the king's son that I was ready to go with him,  upon condition that the blacksmith, who was an inhabitant of a distant  kingdom, and entirely unconnected with me, should be allowed to stay at  Joag till my return: to this they all objected; and insisted, that as we  had all acted contrary to the laws, we were all equally answerable for  our conduct.      [8] Maana is within a short distance of the ruins of Fort St. Joseph,      on the Senegal river, formerly a French factory.    I now took my landlord aside, and giving him a small present of  gunpowder, asked his advice in so critical a situation. He was decidedly  of opinion that I ought not to go to the king: he was fully convinced, he  said, that if the king should discover anything valuable in my  possession, he would not be over scrupulous about the means of obtaining  it. This made me the more solicitous to conciliate matters with the  king's people; and I began by observing, that what I had done did not  proceed from any want of respect towards the king, nor from any wish to  violate his laws, but wholly from my own inexperience and ignorance,  being a stranger, totally unacquainted with the laws and customs of their  country. I had indeed entered the king's frontier, without knowing that I  was to pay the duties beforehand, but I was ready to pay them now; which  I thought was all that they could reasonably demand. I then tendered  them, as a present to the king, the five drachms of gold which the King  of Bondou had given me: this they accepted, but insisted on examining my  baggage, which I opposed in vain. The bundles were opened; but the men  were much disappointed in not finding in them so much gold and amber as  they expected; they made up the deficiency, however, by taking whatever  things they fancied; and after wrangling and debating with me till  sunset, they departed, having first robbed me of half my goods. These  proceedings dispirited my people, and our fortitude was not strengthened  by a very indifferent supper, after a long fast. Madiboo begged me to  turn back; Johnson laughed at the thoughts of proceeding without money,  and the blacksmith was afraid to be seen, or even to speak, lest any one  should discover him to be a native of Kasson. In this disposition we  passed the night by the side of a dim fire, and our situation the next  day was very perplexing: it was impossible to procure provisions without  money, and I knew that if I produced any beads or amber, the king would  immediately hear of it, and I should probably lose the few effects I had  concealed. We therefore resolved to combat hunger for the day, and wait  some favourable opportunity of purchasing or begging provisions.    Towards evening, as I was sitting upon the Bentang, chewing straws, an  old female slave, passing by with a basket upon her head, asked me _if I  had got my dinner_. As I thought she only laughed at me, I gave her no  answer; but my boy, who was sitting close by, answered for me, and told  her that the king's people had robbed me of all my money. On hearing  this, the good old woman, with a look of unaffected benevolence,  immediately took the basket from her head, and showing me that it  contained ground nuts, asked me if I could eat them; being answered in  the affirmative, she presented me with a few handfuls, and walked away  before I had time to thank her for this seasonable supply. This trifling  circumstance gave me peculiar satisfaction. I reflected with pleasure on  the conduct of this poor untutored slave, who, without examining into my  character or circumstances, listened implicitly to the dictates of her  own heart. Experience had taught her that hunger was painful, and her own  distresses made her commiserate those of others.    The old woman had scarcely left me, when I received information that a  nephew of Demba Sego Jalla, the Mandingo King of Kasson, was coming to  pay me a visit. He had been sent on an embassy to Batcheri, King of  Kajaaga, to endeavour to settle the disputes which had arisen between his  uncle and the latter; but after debating the matter four days without  success, he was now on his return; and hearing that a white man was at  Joag, in his way to Kasson, curiosity brought him to see me. I  represented to him my situation and distresses; when he frankly offered  me his protection, and said he would be my guide to Kasson, (provided I  would set out the next morning,) and be answerable for my safety. I  readily and gratefully accepted his offer; and was ready, with my  attendants, by daylight on the morning of the 27th of December.    My protector, whose name was Demba Sego, probably after his uncle, had a  numerous retinue. Our company at leaving Joag consisted of thirty persons  and six loaded asses; and we rode on cheerfully enough for some hours,  without any remarkable occurrence, until we came to a species of tree,  for which my interpreter, Johnson, had made frequent inquiry. On finding  it, he desired us to stop; and producing a white chicken, which he had  purchased at Joag for the purpose, he tied it by the leg to one of the  branches, and then told us we might now safely proceed, for that our  journey would be prosperous. This circumstance is mentioned merely to  illustrate the disposition of the Negroes, and to show the power of  superstition over their minds; for although this man had resided seven  years in England, it was evident that he still retained the prejudices  and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8565"],[0,"A Book of German Lyrics (#15)"],[1,"is good.          SCHILLER    Friedrich Schiller was born in Marbach, Württemberg, November 10, 1759.  His short life was one great heroic struggle. His first inclination was  to study for the ministry, but the rigorous and arbitrary discipline of  the Duke Karl Eugen, whose school the boy as the son of an officer had to  enter, considered neither aptitude nor desire, and thus Schiller had to  study medicine and become an army surgeon. That he might shape his own  destiny he fled from Württemberg in 1782. The following years, in which  Schiller gradually gained the recognition he deserved, were a bitter  battle against poverty; and when in 1789 he had been made professor of  history in Jena, only two years passed before illness forced him to  resign. At that moment generous friends came to his aid, and from now on  Schiller could live for his ideals.    As he had mastered the field of history, he now for years put his entire  energy into the study of philosophy to round out his _Weltanschauung_  (his view of life) and his personality. Even as he worked, he knew that  his years were numbered, but his indomitable will forced the weak body to  do its bidding, and the best of Schiller's dramas, the greatest of his  philosophical poems, were written in these years of illness. Thus  Schiller proved himself the master of his fate, the captain of his soul.  Only a few weeks before his death he wrote to Wilhelm von Humboldt, _\"Am  Ende sind wir doch beide Idealisten, und würden uns schämen, uns  nachsagen zu lassen, daß die Dinge uns formten und wir nicht die Dinge.\"_  (\"After all both of us are idealists and would be ashamed to have it  reported of us that the things fashioned us and not we the things.\")  There was in Schiller, as Goethe said, _ein Zug nach dem Höheren_, a  trend toward higher things. Schiller died in Weimar, May 9, 1805.    As a poet Schiller is in many respects the exact counterpart of Goethe.  The latter's lyric verse is the direct result of his everyday experience;  his real domain is the simple lyric, _das Lied_.  Schiller, however,  confessed that lyric poetry in the narrower sense was not his province,  but his exile. Hardly ever did an everyday experience move him to song,  and he is at his best in the realm of philosophic poetry, where he has no  equal. This philosophic tendency predominates even in his ballads, which  are often the embodiment of a philosophical or ethical idea. While they  lack the subtle lyrical atmosphere of Goethe's, they are distinguished by  rhetorical vigor and dramatic life. Their very structure is dramatic, as  an analysis of 18 and 19 will show.      18. Ibykus, a Greek lyric poet of the sixth century B.C., bom in Rhegium,  a city in Southern Italy.        1. The Isthmian Games were celebrated every two years on the Isthmus      of Corinth in honor of Poseidon (Neptune), god of the sea.        6. Apollo, the god of song, archery and the sun (hence also called      Helios, 71).        10. _AKRORINTH_, the citadel of Corinth, situated on a mountain above      the city.        11. The pine was sacred to Poseidon. A wreath of pine was the award      of victory in the games (54).        23. _DER GASTLICHE._ Zeus, to whom hospitality was sacred.        61. _PRYTANE_, _m._--_en_, prytanis, the chief magistrate.        82. _BÜHNE_, here used for the tiers of seats for the spectators.      Compare _Schaugerüste_, 95.        91. _KEKROPS' STADT_==Athens. Kekrops, the legendary founder of the      state of Athens. _AULIS_, a harbor in Boeotia.        92. _PHOKIS_, territory in Greece to the west of Boeotia.        103. _RIESENMAß_. Since the Greek actors wore buskins and a long      mask, the gigantic stature of the chorus is in itself no indubitable      proof of the supernatural origin of this chorus.  Thus the spectators      are unable to decide, whether they actually see the Eumenides or only      a chorus impersonating them. This is the meaning of 145 and 146. This      doubt yields to certainty as the action progresses (170 ff.).        117. _sense beguiling_, _heart deluding_.        118. _ERINNYEN_ or _Eumeniden_. _Eumenides_, are the avenging      goddesses of Greek mythology, the Furies.        150. _weaves the dark entangled net of fate_.        173. _GEROCHEN_, common form is _gerächt_.        182. _DIE SZENE_==Greek _skaene_ [Greek: skaenae], _the stage_.      19. The problem of the limitation of human knowledge and of the human  mind, already touched upon in Genesis 2, 17, had been brought into  prominence in Schiller's time by the philosopher Kant. He had defined the  limitations of the human mind: we can have no real knowledge of things  themselves, but can know only the impressions that things make on our  senses; furthermore our knowledge is limited to the finite, we have no  knowledge of the Infinite, the Absolute. Schiller, not satisfied with the  mere fact, in this poem expresses the conviction that there must be an  ethical reason for this necessity, a reason that is beyond our ken.  Compare also the beautiful words of Lessing: _\"Nicht die Wahrheit, in  deren Besitz irgend ein Mensch ist, oder zu sein vermeinet, sondern die  aufrichtige Mühe, die er angewandt hat, hinter die Wahrheit zu kommen,  macht den Wert des Menschen. Denn nicht durch den Besitz, sondern durch  die Nachforschung der Wahrheit erweitern sich seine Kräfte, worin allein  seine immer wachsende Vollkommenheit bestehet. Der Besitz macht ruhig,  träge, stolz._    \"_Wenn Gott in seiner Rechten alle Wahrheit, und in seiner Linken den  einzigen immer regen Trieb nach Wahrheit, obschon mit dem Zusatze, mich  immer und ewig zu irren, verschlossen hielte, und spräche zu mir: wähle!  Ich fiele ihm mit Demut in seine Linke, und sagte: Vater, gib! die reine  Wahrheit ist ja doch nur für dich allein!\"_          SAIS, city in ancient Egypt, seat of a famous shrine to Isis.      ÄGYPTENLAND, _Ägypten_==Egypt.        6. HIEROPHANT, [Greek: hierophantaes] (_literally_, the interpreter      of the holy), _hierophant_, a priest, the teacher of religious      mysteries.        61. _a thrill of heat and cold surges through his frame._        64. IN SEINEM INNERN, _in his heart_ or _within him_.        65. DEN ALLHEILIGEN, _the most holy (God)_. _All_ here has an      intensifying meaning.        81. WAR DAHIN, _was gone_.          UHLAND    Ludwig Uhland was born April 26, 1787, in Tübingen, where his father and  both his grandfathers had been connected with the University. Uhland took  up the profession of law, but his heart's desire led him to the study of  the older German poetry and folklore, and from 1830 to 1832 he occupied  the chair of German Literature in Tübingen. He also took an active part  in the political life of his time in the interest of liberal tendencies  and a united Germany. He died in Tubingen, November 13, 1862. His poetry  is for the most part a product of his earlier years. Reserved and  retiring to a fault, Uhland in his lyrics but rarely gives us directly  his own emotional life, preferring to let the shepherd, the soldier, the  mountain lad speak. The type of the simple folksong predominates, and  from the _VOLKSLIED_ Uhland introduced into modern verse the modified  Nibelungen stanza and the rhymed couplet. In his ballads Uhland prefers  older historical subjects, as in _Taillefer_, that rarest jewel among his  ballads; or at least uses an historic setting, as in the more popular  _Des Sängers Fluch_.      21.--6. _Mutterhaus_, i.e., source.        18. RUFE ZU, _call to them_.        22.

EINMAL, _sometime_.      24.--7. SICH INS FELD MACHEN, to start out into the field. Compare _sich  auf den Weg machen_, _to start out_.      25.--67. MIT JEDEM TAG, compare English, _with every passing day_.      27.--3. IN FREIER HAND, _with free_, i.e., _unsupported, hand_.        4. ERFAND = _fand_.        8. SOLL GEHOLFEN SEIN, _it shall be remedied_.      29.--1. ZOGEN ... WOHL, render _did journey_.        2. BEI, _at the house of_; _bei einer Frau Wirtin_, _at the inn of      mine hostess_.        3. HAT SIE, third person singular as formal direct address      (obsolete).        13. DECKTE DEN SCHLEIER ZU, _covered her face with the veil_.        14. DAZU, _while doing this_.        17. HUB, archaic for _hob_.        18. AN, archaic for _auf_.      30.--2. NIT, dialectal for _nicht_.        5. IN GLEICHEM SCHRITT UND TRITT, _keeping step_.        6.
