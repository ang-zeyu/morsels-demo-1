            for it is their perpetual possession.    03:025:035 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with             thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a             stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.    03:025:036 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that             thy brother may live with thee.    03:025:037 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy             victuals for increase.    03:025:038 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the             land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your             God.    03:025:039 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be             sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a             bondservant:    03:025:040 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with             thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.    03:025:041 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children             with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the             possession of his fathers shall he return.    03:025:042 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the             land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.    03:025:043 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy             God.    03:025:044 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,             shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them             shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.    03:025:045 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn             among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that             are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be             your possession.    03:025:046 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children             after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be             your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of             Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.    03:025:047 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy             brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto             the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the             stranger's family:    03:025:048 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his             brethren may redeem him:    03:025:049 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any             that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or             if he be able, he may redeem himself.    03:025:050 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year             that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price             of his sale shall be according unto the number of years,             according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with             him.    03:025:051 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he             shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money             that he was bought for.    03:025:052 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile,             then he shall count with him, and according unto his years             shall he give him again the price of his redemption.    03:025:053 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the             other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.    03:025:054 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out             in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.    03:025:055 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my             servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am             the LORD your God.    03:026:001 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you             up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of             stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD             your God.    03:026:002 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am             the LORD.    03:026:003 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do             them;    03:026:004 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall             yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield             their fruit.    03:026:005 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the             vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat             your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.    03:026:006 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and             none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of             the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.    03:026:007 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before             you by the sword.    03:026:008 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you             shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall             before you by the sword.    03:026:009 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and             multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.    03:026:010 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of             the new.    03:026:011 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor             you.    03:026:012 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall             be my people.    03:026:013 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the             land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen;

I will even appoint over you             terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume             the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your             seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.    03:026:017 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain             before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you;             and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.    03:026:018 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I             will punish you seven times more for your sins.    03:026:019 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your             heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:    03:026:020 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall             not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land             yield their fruits.    03:026:021 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me;             I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to             your sins.    03:026:022 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of             your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in             number; and your high ways shall be desolate.    03:026:023 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will             walk contrary unto me;    03:026:024 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you             yet seven times for your sins.    03:026:025 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the             quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together             within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and             ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.    03:026:026 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women             shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you             your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be             satisfied.    03:026:027 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk             contrary unto me;    03:026:028 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even             I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.    03:026:029 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your             daughters shall ye eat.    03:026:030 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,             and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my             soul shall abhor you.    03:026:031 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries             unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet             odours.    03:026:032 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies             which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.    03:026:033 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a             sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your             cities waste.    03:026:034 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth             desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land;

But while their meat             was yet in their mouths,    19:078:031 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,             and smote down the chosen men of Israel.    19:078:032 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his             wondrous works.    19:078:033 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years             in trouble.    19:078:034 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and             enquired early after God.    19:078:035 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God             their redeemer.    19:078:036 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they             lied unto him with their tongues.    19:078:037 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they             stedfast in his covenant.    19:078:038 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and             destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away,             and did not stir up all his wrath.    19:078:039 For he remembered that"]]]
