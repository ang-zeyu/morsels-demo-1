Go and report  punctually to their worships, on whose sentence hangs life or death what  you shall hear and see. This ruby I drew from the finger of a minister,  whom I stretched at the feet of his prince, during the chase. He had  fawned himself up from the lowest dregs, to be the first favorite;--the  ruin of his neighbor was his ladder to greatness--orphans' tears helped  him to mount it. This diamond I took from a lord treasurer, who sold  offices of honor and trust to the highest bidder, and drove the sorrowing  patriot from his door. This opal I wear in honor of a priest of your  cloth, whom I dispatched with my own hand, after he had publicly deplored  in his pulpit the waning power of the Inquisition. I could tell you more  stories about my rings, but that I repent the words I have already wasted  upon you--    FATHER DOM. O Pharaoh! Pharaoh!    CHARLES. Do you hear it? Did you mark that sigh? Does he not stand  there as if he were imploring fire from heaven to descend and destroy  this troop of Korah? He pronounces judgment with a shrug of the  shoulders, and eternal damnation with a Christian \"Alas!\" Is it  possible for humanity to be so utterly blind? He who has the hundred  eyes of Argus to spy out the faults of his brother--can he be so totally  blind to his own? They thunder forth from their clouds about gentleness  and forbearance, while they sacrifice human victims to the God of love  as if he were the fiery Moloch. They preach the love of one's neighbor,  while they drive the aged and blind with curses from their door. They  rave against covetousness; yet for the sake of gold they have  depopulated Peru, and yoked the natives, like cattle, to their chariots.  They rack their brains in wonder to account for the creation of a Judas  Iscariot, yet the best of them would betray the whole Trinity for ten  shekels. Out upon you, Pharisees! ye falsifiers of truth! ye apes of  Deity! You are not ashamed to kneel before crucifixes and altars; you  lacerate your backs with thongs, and mortify your flesh with fasting;  and with these pitiful mummeries you think, fools as you are, to veil  the eyes of Him whom, with the same breath, you address as the  Omniscient, just as the great are the most bitterly mocked by those who  flatter them while they pretend to hate flatterers. You boast of your  honesty and your exemplary conduct; but the God who sees through your  hearts would be wroth with Him that made you, were He not the same that  had also created the monsters of the Nile. Away with him out of my  sight!    FATHER DOM. That such a miscreant should be so proud!    CHARLES. That's not all. Now I will speak proudly. Go and tell the  right worshipful justices--who set men's lives upon the cast of a die--  I am not one of those thieves who conspire with sleep and midnight, and  play the hero and the lordling on a scaling-ladder. What I have done I  shall no doubt hereafter be doomed to read in the register of heaven;  but with his miserable ministers of earth I will waste no more words.  Tell your masters that my trade is retribution--vengeance my occupation!  (He turns his back upon him.)    FATHER DOM. Then you despise mercy and forbearance?---Be it so, I have  done with you. (Turning to the troop.) Now then, sirs, you shall hear  what the high powers direct me to make known to you!--If you will  instantly deliver up to me this condemned malefactor, bound hand and  foot, you shall receive a full pardon--your enormities shall be entirely  blotted out, even from memory. The holy church will receive you, like  lost sheep, with renewed love, into her maternal bosom, and the road to  honorable employment shall be open to you all. (With a triumphant  smile.) Now sir! how does your majesty relish this? Come on! bind him!  and you are free!    CHARLES. Do you hear that? Do you hear it? What startles you? Why do  you hesitate? They offer you freedom--you that are already their  prisoners. They grant you your lives, and that is no idle pretence, for  it is clear you are already condemned felons. They promise you honor  and emolument; and, on the other hand, what can you hope for, even  should you be victorious to-day, but disgrace, and curses, and  persecution? They ensure you the pardon of Heaven; you that are  actually damned. There is not a single hair on any of you that is not  already bespoke in hell. Do you still hesitate? are you staggered? Is  it so difficult, then, to choose between heaven and hell?--Do put in a  word, father!    FATHER DOM. (aside.) Is the fellow crazy? (Aloud.) Perhaps you are  afraid that this is a trap to catch you alive?--Read it yourselves!  Here--is the general pardon fully signed. (He hands a paper to  SCHWEITZER.) Can you still doubt?    CHARLES. Only see! only see! What more can you require? Signed with  their own hands! It is mercy beyond all bounds! Or are you afraid of  their breaking their word, because you have heard it said that no faith  need be kept with traitors? Dismiss that fear! Policy alone would  constrain them to keep their word, even though it should merely have  been pledged to old Nick. Who hereafter would believe them? How could  they trade with it a second time? I would take my oath upon it that  they mean it sincerely. They know that I am the man who has goaded you  on and incited you; they believe you innocent. They look upon your  crimes as so many juvenile errors--exuberances of rashness. It is I  alone they want. I must pay the penalty. Is it not so, father?    FATHER DOM. What devil incarnate is it that speaks out of him? Of  course it is so--of course. The fellow turns my brain.    CHARLES. What! no answer yet? Do you think it possible to cut your way  through yon phalanx? Only look round you! just look round! You surely  do not reckon upon that; that were indeed a childish conceit--Or do you  flatter yourselves that you will fall like heroes, because you saw that  I rejoiced in the prospect of the fight? Oh, do not console yourself  with the thought! You are not MOOR. You are miserable thieves!  wretched tools of my great designs! despicable as the rope in the hand  of the hangman! No! no! Thieves do not fall like heroes. Life must be  the hope of thieves, for something fearful has to follow. Thieves may  well be allowed to quake at the fear of death. Hark! Do you hear their  horns echoing through the forest? See there! how their glittering  sabres threaten! What! are you still irresolute? are you mad? are you  insane? It is unpardonable. Do you imagine I shall thank you for my  life? I disdain your sacrifice!    FATHER DOM. (in utter amazement). I shall go mad! I must be gone!  Was the like ever heard of?    CHARLES. Or are you afraid that I shall stab myself, and so by suicide  put an end to the bargain, which only holds good if I am given up alive?  No, comrades! that is a vain fear. Here, I fling away my dagger, and my  pistols, and this phial of poison, which might have been a treasure to  me. I am so wretched that I have lost the power even over my own life.  What! still in suspense? Or do you think, perhaps, that I shall stand  on my defence when you try to seize me? See here! I bind my right hand  to this oak-branch; now I am quite defenceless, a child may overpower  me. Who is the first to desert his captain in the hour of need?    ROLLER (with wild energy). And what though hell encircle us with  ninefold coils! (Brandishing his sword.) Who is the coward that will  betray his captain?    SCHWEITZER (tears the pardon and flings the pieces into FATHER DOMINIC'S  face). Pardon be in our bullets! Away with thee, rascal! Tell your  senate that you could not find a single traitor in all Moor's camp.  Huzza! Huzza! Save the captain!    ALL (shouting). Huzza! Save the captain! Save him! Save our noble  captain!    CHARLES (releasing his hand from the tree, joyfully). Now we are free,  comrades! I feel a host in this single arm! Death or liberty! At the  least they shall not take a man of us alive!          [They sound the signal for attack; noise and tumult.              Exeunt with drawn swords.]                           ACT III.          SCENE I.--AMELIA in the garden, playing the guitar.         Bright as an angel from Walhalla's hall,        More beautiful than aught of earth was he!       Heaven-mild his look, as sunbeams when they fall,        Reflected from a calm cerulean sea.         His warm embrace--oh, ravishing delight!        With heart to heart the fiery pulses danced--       Our every sense wrap'd in ecstatic night--        Our souls in blissful harmony entranced.         His kisses--oh, what paradise of feeling!        E'en as two flames which round each other twine--       Or flood of seraph harp-tones gently stealing        In one soft swell, away to realms divine!         They rushed, commingled, melted, soul in soul!        Lips glued to lips, with burning tremor bound!       Cold earth dissolved, and love without control        Absorbed all sense of worldly things around!         He's gone!--forever gone! Alas! in vain        My bleeding heart in bitter anguish sighs;       To me is left alone this world of pain,        And mortal life in hopeless sorrow dies.                     Enter FRANCIS.    FRANCIS. Here again already, perverse enthusiast? You stole away from  the festive banquet, and marred the mirthful pleasures of my guests.    AMELIA. 'Tis pity, truly, to mar such innocent pleasures! Shame on  them! The funeral knell that tolled over your father's grave must still  be ringing in your ears--    FRANCIS. Wilt thou sorrow, then, forever? Let the dead sleep in peace,  and do thou make the living happy! I come--    AMELIA. And when do you go again?    FRANCIS. Alas! Look not on me thus sorrowfully! You wound me, Amelia.  I come to tell you--    AMELIA. To tell me, I suppose, that Francis von Moor has become lord  and master here.    FRANCIS.

Then you shall shield my breast and I will yours;  Thus each be strengthened by the others' aid!  Yet wherefore talk we while our native land  Is still to alien tyranny a prey?  First let us sweep the foeman from the soil,  Then reconcile our difference in peace!       [After a moment's pause.    How! You are silent! Not a word for me?  And have I yet no title to your trust?  Then must I force my way, despite your will,  Into the league you secretly have formed.  You've held a Diet on the Rootli,--I  Know this,--know all that was transacted there!  And though I was not trusted with your secret,  I still have kept it like a sacred pledge.  Trust me, I never was my country's foe,  Nor would I ever have ranged myself against you!  Yet you did wrong to put your rising off.  Time presses! We must strike, and swiftly, too!  Already Tell has fallen a sacrifice  To your delay.    STAUFFACHER.          We swore to wait till Christmas.    RUDENZ.  I was not there,--I did not take the oath.  If you delay I will not!    MELCHTHAL.               What! You would----    RUDENZ.  I count me now among the country's fathers,  And to protect you is my foremost duty.    FURST.  Within the earth to lay these dear remains,  That is your nearest and most sacred duty.    RUDENZ.  When we have set the country free, we'll place  Our fresh, victorious wreaths upon his bier.  Oh, my dear friends, 'tis not your cause alone!  I have a cause to battle with the tyrants  That more concerns myself. Know, that my Bertha  Has disappeared,--been carried off by stealth,  Stolen from amongst us by their ruffian bands!    STAUFFACHER.  And has the tyrant dared so fell an outrage  Against a lady free and nobly born?    RUDENZ.  Alas! my friends, I promised help to you,  And I must first implore it for myself?  She that I love is stolen--is forced away,  And who knows where the tyrant has concealed her.  Or with what outrages his ruffian crew  May force her into nuptials she detests?  Forsake me not! Oh help me to her rescue!  She loves you! Well, oh well, has she deserved  That all should rush to arms in her behalf.    STAUFFACHER.  What course do you propose?    RUDENZ.                 Alas! I know not.  In the dark mystery that shrouds her fate,  In the dread agony of this suspense,  Where I can grasp at naught of certainty,  One single ray of comfort beams upon me.  From out the ruins of the tyrant's power  Alone can she be rescued from the grave.  Their strongholds must be levelled! Everyone,  Ere we can pierce into her gloomy prison.    MELCHTHAL.  Come, lead us on! We follow! Why defer  Until to-morrow what to-day may do?  Tell's arm was free when we at Rootli swore,  This foul enormity was yet undone.  And change of circumstance brings change of law.  Who such a coward as to waver still?    RUDENZ (to WALTER FURST).  Meanwhile to arms, and wait in readiness  The fiery signal on the mountain-tops.  For swifter than a boat can scour the lake  Shall you have tidings of our victory;  And when you see the welcome flames ascend,  Then, like the lightning, swoop upon the foe,  And lay the despots and their creatures low!        SCENE III.       The pass near Kuessnacht, sloping down from behind, with     rocks on either side. The travellers are visible upon the     heights, before they appear on the stage. Rocks all round     the stage. Upon one of the foremost a projecting cliff     overgrown with brushwood.    TELL (enters with his crossbow).  Here through this deep defile he needs must pass;  There leads no other road to Kuessnacht; here  I'll do it; the opportunity is good.  Yon alder tree stands well for my concealment,  Thence my avenging shaft will surely reach him.  The straitness of the path forbids pursuit.  Now, Gessler, balance thine account with Heaven!  Thou must away from earth, thy sand is run.  I led a peaceful, inoffensive life;  My bow was bent on forest game alone,  And my pure soul was free from thoughts of murder.  But thou hast scared me from my dream of peace;  The milk of human kindness thou hast turned  To rankling poison in my breast, and made  Appalling deeds familiar to my soul.  He who could make his own child's head his mark  Can speed his arrow to his foeman's heart.    My children dear, my loved and faithful wife,  Must be protected, tyrant, from thy fury!  When last I drew my bow, with trembling hand,  And thou, with murderous joy, a father forced  To level at his child; when, all in vain,  Writhing before thee, I implored thy mercy,  Then in the agony of my soul I vowed  A fearful oath, which met God's ear alone,  That when my bow next winged an arrow's flight  Its aim should be thy heart. The vow I made  Amid the hellish torments of that moment  I hold a sacred debt, and I will pay it.    Thou art my lord, my emperor's delegate,  Yet would the emperor not have stretched his power  So far as thou. He sent thee to these Cantons  To deal forth law, stern law, for he is angered;  But not to wanton with unbridled will  In every cruelty, with fiendlike joy:  There is a God to punish and avenge.    Come forth, thou bringer once of bitter pangs,  My precious jewel now, my chiefest treasure;  A mark I'll set thee, which the cry of grief  Could never penetrate, but thou shalt pierce it.  And thou, my trusty bowstring, that so oft  Has served me faithfully in sportive scenes,  Desert me not in this most serious hour--  Only be true this once, my own good cord,  That has so often winged the biting shaft:--  For shouldst thou fly successless from my hand,  I have no second to send after thee.       [Travellers pass over the stage.    I'll sit me down upon this bench of stone,  Hewn for the wayworn traveller's brief repose--  For here there is no home. Each hurries by  The other, with quick step and careless look,  Nor stays to question of his grief. Here goes  The merchant, full of care--the pilgrim next,  With slender scrip--and then the pious monk,  The scowling robber, and the jovial player,  The carrier with his heavy-laden horse,  That comes to us from the far haunts of men;  For every road conducts to the world's end.  They all push onwards--every man intent  On his own several business--mine is murder.       [Sits down.    Time was, my dearest children, when with joy  You hailed your father's safe return to home  From his long mountain toils; for when he came  He ever brought some little present with him.  A lovely Alpine flower--a curious bird--  Or elf-boat found by wanderers on the hills.  But now he goes in quest of other game:  In the wild pass he sits, and broods on murder;  And watches for the life-blood of his foe,  But still his thoughts are fixed on you alone,  Dear children. 'Tis to guard your innocence,  To shield you from the tyrant's fell revenge,  He bends his bow to do a deed of blood!       [Rises.    Well--I am watching for a noble prey--  Does not the huntsman, with severest toil,  Roam for whole days amid the winter's cold,  Leap with a daring bound from rock to rock,--  And climb the jagged, slippery steeps, to which  His limbs are glued by his own streaming blood;  And all this but to gain a wretched chamois.  A far more precious prize is now my aim--  The heart of that dire foe who would destroy me.       [Sprightly music heard in the distance, which     comes gradually nearer.    From my first years of boyhood I have used  The bow--been practised in the archer's feats;  The bull's-eye many a time my shafts have hit,  And many a goodly prize have I brought home,  Won in the games of skill. This day I'll make  My master-shot, and win the highest prize  Within the whole circumference of the mountains.       [A marriage train passes over the stage, and goes up     the pass. TELL gazes at it, leaning on his bow. He     is joined by STUSSI, the Ranger.    STUSSI.  There goes the bridal party of the steward  Of Moerlischachen's cloister. He is rich!  And has some ten good pastures on the Alps.  He goes to fetch his bride from Imisee,  There will be revelry to-night at Kuessnacht.  Come with us--every honest man's invited.    TELL.  A gloomy guest fits not a wedding feast.    STUSSI.  If grief oppress you, dash it from your heart!  Bear with your lot. The times are heavy now,  And we must snatch at pleasure while we can.  Here 'tis a bridal, there a burial.    TELL.  And oft the one treads close upon the other.    STUSSI.  So runs the world at present. Everywhere  We meet with woe and misery enough.  There's been a slide of earth in Glarus, and  A whole side of the Glaernisch has fallen in.    TELL.  Strange! And do even the hills begin to totter?  There is stability for naught on earth.    STUSSI.  Strange tidings, too, we hear from other parts.  I spoke with one but now, that came from Baden,  Who said a knight was on his way to court,  And as he rode along a swarm of wasps  Surrounded him, and settling on his horse,  So fiercely stung the beast that it fell dead,  And he proceeded to the court on foot.    TELL.  Even the weak are furnished with a sting.       [ARMGART (enters with several children, and places     herself at the entrance of the pass).    STUSSI.  'Tis thought to bode disaster to the country,  Some horrid deed against the course of nature.    TELL.  Why, every day brings forth such fearful deeds;  There needs no miracle to tell their coming.    STUSSI.  Too true! He's blessed who tills his field in peace,  And sits untroubled by his own fireside.    TELL.  The very meekest cannot rest in quiet,  Unless it suits with his ill neighbor's humor.       [TELL looks frequently with restless expectation     towards the top of the pass.    STUSSI.  So fare you well! You're waiting some one here?    TELL.  I am.    STUSSI.      A pleasant meeting with your friends!  You are from Uri, are you not? His grace  The governor's expected thence to-day.    TRAVELLER (entering).  Look not to see the governor to-day.  The streams are flooded by the heavy rains,  And all the"]]]
