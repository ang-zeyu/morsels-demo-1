For the tourist who wants to \"see it all,\" it is an  excellent and most comfortable central headquarters.    [Illustration: A VILLAGE STREET _Calvario, Havana Province_]    From Villa Clara it is only a short run to Cienfuegos, the \"city of a  hundred fires,\" a modern place, only about a hundred years old. There is  every probability that Columbus entered the harbor in 1494, and perhaps  no less probability that Ocampo entered in 1508, on his voyage around the  island. The harbor extends inland for several miles, with an irregular  shore line, behind which rises a border line of hills. The city itself  is some four or five miles from the entrance to the harbor. It came into  existence, and still exists, chiefly by reason of the sugar business. It  is an important outlet for that industry, and many estates are in its near  vicinity. The old city of Trinidad is reached, by boat, from Cienfuegos, or  rather its port city, Casilda, is so reached. Presumably, it was the port  city that Velasquez founded in 1514, a location a few miles inland  being chosen later, as being less exposed to attacks by the pirates and  freebooters who infested the Caribbean Sea for many years. It is said that  Cortes landed here and recruited his forces on his way to Mexico, in 1518.  The city itself stands on the lower slopes of the hills that form its  highly effective background. Its streets are narrow and tortuous. Like most  of the cities of the island, and most of the cities of the world, it has  its humble homes of the poor, and its mansions of the rich. Immediately  behind it stands a hill with an elevation of about nine hundred feet above  sea-level. Its name indicates the reason for its application, _La Vigia_,  the \"lookout,\" or the \"watch-tower.\" From its summit, we may assume that  the people of earlier times scanned the horizon for any sign of approaching  pirates by whom they might be attacked. It serves a more satisfactory  purpose nowadays in that it affords one of the loveliest panoramic views to  be found anywhere in Cuba. Not far away, and accessible from the city, is  the Pico de Potrerillo, about 3,000 feet elevation, the highest point in  Central Cuba. Northeast of Trinidad, and reached by rail from Villa Clara,  is Sancti Spiritus, Trinidad's rival in antiquity, both having been  founded, by Velasquez, in the same year. Here also are narrow, crooked  streets in a city of no mean attractions, although it lacks the picturesque  charm of its rival in age. It is an inland city, about twenty-five miles  from the coast, but even that did not protect it from attack by the  pirates. It was several times the victim of their depredations.          VII    _AROUND THE ISLAND: Continued_      The next city, eastward, is Camaguey, in many ways doubtless the best  worth a visit, next to Havana, of any city on the island. It is a place  of interesting history and, for me personally, a place of somewhat mixed  recollections. The history may wait until I have told my story. I think  it must have been on my third visit to the island, early in 1902. On my  arrival in Havana, I met my friend Charles M. Pepper, a fellow laborer in  the newspaper field. He at once informed me that he and I were to start the  next morning for a three or four weeks' journey around the island. It was  news to me, and the fact that my baggage, excepting the suitcase that I  carried, had failed to come on the boat that brought me, led me to demur.  My objections were overruled on the ground that we could carry little  baggage anyway, and all that was needed could be bought before starting, or  along the way. The next morning saw us on the early train for Matanzas. We  spent a week or ten days in that city, in Cardenas, Sagua, Santa Clara, and  Cienfuegos, renewing former acquaintance and noting the changes effected by  the restoration from the war period. That was before the completion of the  Cuba Railway. To get to Camaguey, then known as Puerto Principe, we took  the steamer at Cienfuegos and journeyed along the coast to Jucaro. There,  because of shallow water, we were dropped into a shore boat some four or  five miles from the coast, and there our troubles began. Fortunately, it  was early morning. We got something to eat and some coffee, which is almost  invariably good in Cuba, but when we meet nowadays we have a laugh over  that breakfast at Jucaro. I don't know, and really don't care, what the  place is now. After some hours of waiting, we secured passage in an  antiquated little car attached to a freight train carrying supplies and  structural material to Ciego de Avila, for use by the railway then being  built in both directions, eastward and westward from that point. The line  that there crosses the island from north to south was built in the time  of the Ten Years' War (1868-1878) as a barrier against the revolutionists  operating in eastern Cuba. It was restored for use in the revolution of  1895, but its blockhouses at every kilometre, and its barbed wire tangles,  were entirely ineffective against Gomez and Maceo and other leaders, all of  whom crossed it at their own sweet will, although not without an occasional  vicious little contest. We reached Ciego de Avila soon after noon, and had  to wait there over night for a further advance. The place is now a thriving  little city, but it was then a somewhat sprawling village with a building  that was called a hotel. But we got food and drink and beds, all that is  really necessary for experienced campaigners. For the next two days, Old  Man Trouble made himself our personal companion and did not lose sight of  us for a single minute.    Through personal acquaintance with the railway officials, we obtained  permission to travel over the line, on any and all trains, as far as it was  then built, some forty miles or so toward Camaguey. Through them, also, we  arranged for saddle horses to meet us at railhead for the remainder of the  journey. There were no trains except construction trains carrying rails,  ties, lumber, and other materials. We boarded the first one out in the  morning. We had our choice of riding on any of those commodities that we  might select. There was not even a caboose. We chose a car of lumber as the  most promising. For four or five hours we crawled through that country,  roasting and broiling on that pile of planks, but the ties and the rails  were even hotter. The only way we could keep a place cool enough to sit on  was by sitting on it. I once occupied a stateroom next to the steamer's  funnel. I have seen, day after day, the pitch bubble between the planks of  a steamer's deck in the Indian Ocean. I have been in other places that I  thought plenty hot enough, but never have I been so thoroughly cooked as  were my companion and I perched on the lumber pile. On top of that, or  rather on top of us, there poured a constant rain of cinders from the  locomotive puffing away a few cars ahead of us. The road-bed was rough, and  at times we had to hang on for our very lives. We can laugh about it now,  but, at the time, it was no joke. At last we reached the end of the line,  somewhere in a hot Cuban forest, but there were no horses. We watched the  operation of railway building, and took turns in anathematizing, in every  language of which we had any knowledge, the abandoned ruffian who failed to  appear with those horses. Before night, we were almost ready to wish that  he had died on the way. At last he came. Our baggage was loaded on a  pack-horse; we mounted and rode gallantly on our way. We had about thirty  miles to cover by that or some other means of locomotion. Before we had  gone a mile, we developed a clear understanding of the reasons for the sale  of those horses by the Government of the United States, but why the United  States Army ever bought them for cavalry mounts we could not even imagine.  There was no road. Most of the way we followed the partly constructed  road-bed for the new railway, making frequent detours, through field or  jungle, to get around gaps or places of impossible roughness. Before we had  covered two miles, we began to wish that the man who sent those horses, a  Spaniard, by the way, might be doomed to ride them through all eternity  under the saddles with which they were equipped. We were sorry enough for  the poor brutes, but sorrier still for ourselves. For several days, I  limped in misery from a long row of savage blisters raised on my leg  by rawhide knots with which my saddle had been repaired. An hour after  starting, we were overtaken by a heavy thunder-shower. At nightfall, after  having covered about fifteen wretched miles, we reached a construction camp  where an American nobleman, disguised as a section-boss, gave us food and  lodging in the little palm-leaf shack that served as his temporary home. It  was barely big enough for one, but he made it do for three.    [Illustration: STREET AND CHURCH _Camaguey_]    Early in the morning, we resumed our journey, plodding along as best we  could over a half-graded \"right-of-way.\" A couple of hours brought us to  a larger construction camp where we halted for such relief as we could  secure. We then were some twelve or fourteen miles from our destination. We  discussed the wisdom of making the rest of the way on foot, as preferable  to that particular kind of saddle-work, leaving our baggage to come along  with the horses when it might. But fortune smiled, or it may have been just  a grimace. Word came that a team, two horses and a wagon, would go to the  city that afternoon, and there would be room for us. We told our pilot,  the man with the horses, just what we thought of him and all his miserable  ancestors, gave him a couple of _pesos_, and rejoiced over our prospects of  better fortune. But it proved to be only an escape from the fire into  the frying-pan. I have driven over many miles of South African _veldt_,  straight \"across lots,\" in all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1149"],[0,"From London to Land's End (#16)"],[1,"little more to say but that from thence the road lies to  Plymouth, distance about six miles.    Plymouth is indeed a town of consideration, and of great importance to  the public.  The situation of it between two very large inlets of the  sea, and in the bottom of a large bay, which is very remarkable for the  advantage of navigation.  The Sound or Bay is compassed on every side  with hills, and the shore generally steep and rocky, though the anchorage  is good, and it is pretty safe riding.  In the entrance to this bay lies  a large and most dangerous rock, which at high-water is covered, but at  low-tide lies bare, where many a good ship has been lost, even in the  view of safety, and many a ship's crew drowned in the night, before help  could be had for them.    Upon this rock (which was called the Eddystone, from its situation) the  famous Mr. Winstanley undertook to build a lighthouse for the direction  of sailors, and with great art and expedition finished it; which  work--considering its height, the magnitude of its building, and the  little hold there was by which it was possible to fasten it to the  rock--stood to admiration, and bore out many a bitter storm.    Mr. Winstanley often visited, and frequently strengthened, the building  by new works, and was so confident of its firmness and stability that he  usually said he only desired to be in it when a storm should happen; for  many people had told him it would certainly fall if it came to blow a  little harder than ordinary.    But he happened at last to be in it once too often--namely, when that  dreadful tempest blew, November 27, 1703.  This tempest began on the  Wednesday before, and blew with such violence, and shook the lighthouse  so much, that, as they told me there, Mr. Winstanley would fain have been  on shore, and made signals for help; but no boats durst go off to him;  and, to finish the tragedy, on the Friday, November 26, when the tempest  was so redoubled that it became a terror to the whole nation, the first  sight there seaward that the people of Plymouth were presented with in  the morning after the storm was the bare Eddystone, the lighthouse being  gone; in which Mr. Winstanley and all that were with him perished, and  were never seen or heard of since.  But that which was a worse loss still  was that, a few days after, a merchant's ship called the _Winchelsea_,  homeward bound from Virginia, not knowing the Eddystone lighthouse was  down, for want of the light that should have been seen, run foul of the  rock itself, and was lost with all her lading and most of her men.  But  there is now another light-house built on the same rock.    What other disasters happened at the same time in the Sound and in the  roads about Plymouth is not my business; they are also published in other  books, to which I refer.    One thing which I was a witness to on a former journey to this place, I  cannot omit.  It was the next year after that great storm, and but a  little sooner in the year, being in August; I was at Plymouth, and  walking on the Hoo (which is a plain on the edge of the sea, looking to  the road), I observed the evening so serene, so calm, so bright, and the  sea so smooth, that a finer sight, I think, I never saw.  There was very  little wind, but what was, seemed to be westerly; and about an hour  after, it blew a little breeze at south-west, with which wind there came  into the Sound that night and the next morning a fleet of fourteen sail  of ships from Barbadoes, richly laden for London.  Having been long at  sea, most of the captains and passengers came on shore to refresh  themselves, as is usual after such tedious voyages; and the ships rode  all in the Sound on that side next to Catwater.  As is customary upon  safe arriving to their native country, there was a general joy and  rejoicing both on board and on shore.    The next day the wind began to freshen, especially in the afternoon, and  the sea to be disturbed, and very hard it blew at night; but all was well  for that time.  But the night after, it blew a dreadful storm (not much  inferior, for the time it lasted, to the storm mentioned above which blew  down the lighthouse on the Eddystone).  About mid-night the noise,  indeed, was very dreadful, what with the rearing of the sea and of the  wind, intermixed with the firing of guns for help from the ships, the  cries of the seamen and people on shore, and (which was worse) the cries  of those which were driven on shore by the tempest and dashed in pieces.  In a word, all the fleet except three, or thereabouts, were dashed to  pieces against the rocks and sunk in the sea, most of the men being  drowned.  Those three who were saved, received so much damage that their  lading was almost all spoiled.  One ship in the dark of the night, the  men not knowing where they were, run into Catwater, and run on shore  there; by which she was, however, saved from shipwreck, and the lives of  her crew were saved also.    This was a melancholy morning indeed.  Nothing was to be seen but wrecks  of the ships and a foaming, furious sea in that very place where they  rode all in joy and triumph but the evening before.  The captains,  passengers, and officers who were, as I have said, gone on shore, between  the joy of saving their lives, and the affliction of having lost their  ships, their cargoes, and their friends, were objects indeed worth our  compassion and observation.  And there was a great variety of the  passions to be observed in them--now lamenting their losses, their giving  thanks for their deliverance.  Many of the passengers had lost their all,  and were, as they expressed themselves, \"utterly undone.\"  They were, I  say, now lamenting their losses with violent excesses of grief; then  giving thanks for their lives, and that they should be brought on shore,  as it were, on purpose to be saved from death; then again in tears for  such as were drowned.  The various cases were indeed very affecting, and,  in many things, very instructing.    As I say, Plymouth lies in the bottom of this Sound, in the centre  between the two waters, so there lies against it, in the same position,  an island, which they call St. Nicholas, on which there is a castle which  commands the entrance into Hamoaze, and indeed that also into Catwater in  some degree.  In this island the famous General Lambert, one of  Cromwell's great agents or officers in the rebellion, was imprisoned for  life, and lived many years there.    On the shore over against this island is the citadel of Plymouth, a small  but regular fortification, inaccessible by sea, but not exceeding strong  by land, except that they say the works are of a stone hard as marble,  and would not soon yield to the batteries of an enemy--but that is a  language our modern engineers now laugh at.    The town stands above this, upon the same rock, and lies sloping on the  side of it, towards the east--the inlet of the sea which is called  Catwater, and which is a harbour capable of receiving any number of ships  and of any size, washing the eastern shore of the town, where they have a  kind of natural mole or haven, with a quay and all other conveniences for  bringing in vessels for loading and unloading; nor is the trade carried  on here inconsiderable in itself, or the number of merchants small.    The other inlet of the sea, as I term it, is on the other side of the  town, and is called Hamoaze, being the mouth of the River Tamar, a  considerable river which parts the two counties of Devon and Cornwall.  Here (the war with France making it necessary that the ships of war  should have a retreat nearer hand than at Portsmouth) the late King  William ordered a wet dock--with yards, dry docks, launches, and  conveniences of all kinds for building and repairing of ships--to be  built; and with these followed necessarily the building of store-houses  and warehouses for the rigging, sails, naval and military stores, &c., of  such ships as may be appointed to be laid up there, as now several are;  with very handsome houses for the commissioners, clerks, and officers of  all kinds usual in the king's yards, to dwell in.  It is, in short, now  become as complete an arsenal or yard for building and fitting men-of-war  as any the Government are masters of, and perhaps much more convenient  than some of them, though not so large.    The building of these things, with the addition of rope-walks and mast-  yards, &c., as it brought abundance of trades-people and workmen to the  place, so they began by little and little to build houses on the lands  adjacent, till at length there appeared a very handsome street, spacious  and large, and as well inhabited; and so many houses are since added that  it is become a considerable town, and must of consequence in time draw  abundance of people from Plymouth itself.    However, the town of Plymouth is, and will always be, a very considerable  town, while that excellent harbour makes it such a general port for the  receiving all the fleets of merchants' ships from the southward (as from  Spain, Italy, the West Indies, &c.), who generally make it the first port  to put in at for refreshment, or safety from either weather or enemies.    The town is populous and wealthy, having, as above, several considerable  merchants and abundance of wealthy shopkeepers, whose trade depends upon  supplying the sea-faring people that upon so many occasions put into that  port.  As for gentlemen--I mean, those that are such by family and birth  and way of living--it cannot be expected to find many such in a town  merely depending on trade, shipping, and sea-faring business; yet I found  here some men of value (persons of liberal education, general knowledge,  and excellent behaviour), whose society obliges me to say that a  gentleman might find very agreeable company in Plymouth.    From Plymouth we pass the Tamar over a ferry to Saltash--a little, poor,  shattered town, the"]]]
