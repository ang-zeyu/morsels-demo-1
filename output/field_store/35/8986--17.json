Two  places kept the return postage she had enclosed and sent the manuscript  back collect. Scenario writing became a rather expensive amusement,  instead of a bringer of fortune. In spite of all this, she kept on  writing scenarios, for the fascination of the game had her in its grip,  and she would never be satisfied until she succeeded. Lessons were  thrust into the background of her mind by the throng of \"scene-plots,\"  \"leaders,\" \"bust-scenes,\" \"inserts,\" \"synopses,\" etc., that flashed  through her head continually.    To write steadily night after night, after the lessons had been gotten  out of the way, was a great tax on her young strength. Nyoda was  inflexible about her stopping typewriting at nine o'clock, but she went  home and wrote by hand until midnight. Nyoda was over at the house one  afternoon when Migwan was settling down to get her lessons, and saw her  take a dose from a phial.    \"What are you taking medicine for?\" she asked.    \"Oh, this is just something to tone me up,\" replied Migwan.    \"What is it?\" insisted Nyoda.    \"It's strychnine,\" said Migwan.    \"Strychnine!\" said Nyoda in a horrified voice. \"Who taught you to take  strychnine as a stimulant?\"    \"Mabel Collins did,\" answered Migwan. \"She said she always took it when  she had a dance on for every night in the week and couldn't keep up any  other way, and it made her feel fine.\" Mabel Collins belonged to what  the class called the \"fast bunch.\"    \"I'll have a talk with Mabel Collins,\" said Nyoda with a resolute gleam  in her eye. \"And, remember, no more of this 'tonic' for you. I knew  girls in college who took strychnine to keep themselves going through  examinations or other occasions of great physical strain, and they have  suffered for it ever since. If you are doing so much that you can't  'keep up' any other way than by taking powerful medicines, it is time  you 'kept down.' Fresh air and regular sleep are all the tonic you need.  You stay away from that typewriter for a whole week and go to bed at  nine o'clock every night. I'm coming down to tuck you in. Now remember!\"  And with this solemn warning Nyoda left her.          CHAPTER VIII.      SAHWAH MAKES A BASKET.    The game between the Washington High School and the Carnegie Mechanics  Institute, which was to decide the girls' basketball championship of the  city, was scheduled for the 15th of February. Up until this year  Washington High had never come within sight of the championship. Then  this season something had happened to the Varsity team which had made it  a power to be reckoned with among the schools of the city. That  something was Sahwah. Thanks to her playing, Washington High had not  lost a single game so far. Her being put on the team was purely due to  chance. Sahwah was a Junior and the Varsity team were all Seniors. She  was a member of the \"scrub\" or practice team and an ardent devotee of  the sport. During one of the early games of the season Sahwah was  sitting on the side lines attentively watching every bit of play.    The game was going against the Washington, due to the fact that their  forwards were too slow to break through the guarding of the rival team.  Sahwah saw the weakness and tingled with a desire to get into the game  and do some speed work. As by a miracle the chance was given her. One of  the forwards strained her finger slightly and was taken from the game.  Her substitute, who had been sitting next to Sahwah, had left her seat  and gone to the other end of the gymnasium. The instructor, who was  acting as referee, in her excitement mistook Sahwah for the substitute  and called her out on the floor. Sahwah wondered but obeyed instantly  and went into the game as forward. Then the spectators began to sit up  and take notice. Sahwah had not been two minutes on the floor when she  made a basket right between the arms of the tall guard. The ripple of  surprise had hardly died away before she had made another. Then the  baskets followed thick and fast. In five minutes of play she had tied  the score. The guards could hardly believe their eyes when they saw this  lithe girl slipping like an eel through their defense and caging the  ball with a sure hand every time. The game ended with an overwhelming  victory for the Washingtons and there was a new star forward on the  horizon. Sahwah was changed from the practice team to the Varsity.    From that time forward Washington High forged steadily ahead in the race  for the championship and as yet had no defeat on its record. However,  Washington had a formidable rival in the Carnegie Mechanics Institute,  which was also undefeated so far. The Mechanicals were slightly older  girls and were known as a whirlwind team. Sahwah, who foresaw long ago  that the supreme struggle would be between the Washingtons and the  Mechanicals, attended the games played by the Mechanicals whenever she  could and studied their style of playing. \"Star players, every one,\" was  her deduction, \"but weak on team work.\" Sahwah was not so dazzled by her  own excellence as a player that she could not recognize greatness in a  rival, and she readily admitted that one of the girls who guarded for  the Mechanicals was the best guard she had ever seen. This was Marie  Lanning, whose cousin Joe was in Sahwah's class at Washington High.  Sahwah knew instinctively that when the struggle came she would go up  against this girl. The game would really be between these two.  Washington's hope lay in Sahwah's ability to make baskets, and the hope  of the Mechanicals was Marie's ability to keep her from making them. So  she studied Marie's guarding until she knew the places where she could  break through.    Marie Lanning also knew that it was Sahwah she would have to deal with.  But there was a difference in the attitude of the girls toward each  other. Sahwah regarded Marie as her opponent, but she respected her  prowess. She had no personal resentment against Marie for being a good  guard; she looked upon her as an enemy merely because she belonged to a  rival school. Marie on the other hand actually hated Sahwah. Before  Sahwah appeared on the scene she had been the greatest player in the  Athletic Association, the heroine of every game. She was pointed out  everywhere she went as \"Marie Lanning, the basketball player.\" Now some  of her glory was dimmed, for another star had risen, Sarah Ann Brewster,  the whirlwind forward of the Washington High team, was threatening to  overshadow her. It was a distinctly personal matter with her. Sahwah  wanted to win that game so her school would have the championship; Marie  wanted to win it for her own glory. She did not really believe that  Sahwah was as great as she was made out. It was only because she had  never run against a great guard that she had been able to roll up the  score for Washington so many times. Well, she would find out a thing or  two when she played the Mechanicals, Marie reflected complacently. She  had never seen Sahwah play, and if any one had suggested that it would  be a good thing to watch her tactics she would have been very scornful.  She was confident in her own powers.    Then there came a rather important game of Washington High's on a night  when Marie was visiting her cousin Joe. He had tickets for the game and  took her along. Now for the first time she beheld her foe. After  watching Sahwah's marvelous shots at the basket and the confusion of the  girl who was guarding her, Marie began to feel uneasy. It now seemed to  her that Sahwah's powers had been underestimated in the reports instead  of over-estimated. The game ended just as all the others had done, with  a great score for Washington High and Sahwah the idol of the hour. Marie  looked on with a slight sneer when Sahwah, after the game was over,  frankly congratulated the losing team on their playing, which had been  pretty good throughout. \"Do you know,\" said Sahwah straightforwardly,  \"that if you had had a little better team work, I don't believe we could  have beaten you.\"    \"Any day we could have won with you in the game,\" said one of the  losers, \"the way you can shoot that ball into the basket.\"    Without being at all puffed up by this compliment, Sahwah proceeded to  make her point. \"My throwing the ball into the basket wasn't what won  the game,\" she said simply, \"it was the fact that I had it to throw.  It's all due to the girls who see that I get it. It's team work that  wins every time and not individual starring.\" Thus was Sahwah in the  habit of disclaiming the credit of victory.    Joe brought up Marie Lanning and introduced her. \"So this is my deadly  enemy,\" said Sahwah pleasantly. Marie acknowledged the introduction  politely, but while her lips smiled her eyes had a steely glitter.  Sahwah was surrounded by a crowd of admiring friends at this time and  there was no chance for further conversation, and she did not become  aware of Marie's animosity. \"We'll meet again,\" Sahwah said meaningly,  with a pleasant laugh, as Marie and Joe turned to go. \"That is,\" she  added with a humorous twinkle, \"if I don't go down in my studies and get  myself debarred from playing.\"    \"Fine chance of your going down,\" said Joe.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" laughed Sahwah; \"it all depends on whether I get my  Physics notebook in by the First.\" A shout of laughter greeted this  remark. The idea of Sahwah's getting herself debarred on account of her  studies was too funny for words.    \"Well,\" said Joe to Marie when they were outside the building, \"that's  the girl you're going to have to play against. What do you think of  her?\" In his heart Joe thought that his cousin Marie would have no  trouble holding Sahwah down.    \"She's a great deal faster than I thought,\" said Marie with a thoughtful  frown.    \"But you can beat her, can't you?\" asked Joe anxiously. \"You've got to.  I've staked my whole winter's allowance that you would win the  championship.\"    \"I didn't know that you were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11734"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 460, October 25, 1884 (#16)"],[1,"in contact is inconsistent with stability. There is a further  condition, upon which I cannot enter into detail just now, but which may be  understood in a general way when I say that it is a condition of either  uniform or of increasing molecular rotation from the surface inward,  analogous to the condition that the density of a liquid, resting for  example under the influence of gravity, must either be uniform or must be  greater below than above for stability of equilibrium. All that I have said  in favor of the model vortex gas composed of perforated solids with fluid  circulations through them holds without modification for the purely  hydro-kinetic model, composed of either Helmholtz cored vortex rings or of  coreless vortices, and we are now troubled with no such difficulty as that  of the impacts between solids. Whether, however, when the vortex theory of  gases is thoroughly worked out, it will or will not be found to fail in a  manner analogous to the failure which I have already pointed out in  connection with the kinetic theory of gases composed of little elastic  solid molecules, I cannot at present undertake to speak with certainty. It  seems to me most probable that the vortex theory cannot fail in any such  way, because all I have been able to find out hitherto regarding the  vibration of vortices,[2] whether cored or coreless, does not seem to imply  the liability of translational or impulsive energies of the individual  vortices becoming lost in energy of smaller and smaller vibrations.    [Footnote 1: Investigations respecting coreless vortices will be found in a  paper by the author, \"Vibrations of a Columnar Vortex,\" _Proc_. R.S.E.,  March 1, 1880; and a paper by Hicks, recently read before the Royal  Society.]    [Footnote 2: See papers by the author \"On Vortex Motion.\" _Trans_. R.S.E.  April, 1867, and \"Vortex Statics,\" _Proc_. R.S.E. December, 1875; also a  paper by J.J. Thomson, B.A., \"On the Vibrations of a Vortex Ring,\" _Trans_.  R.S. December, 1881, and his valuable book on \"Vortex Motion.\"]    As a step toward kinetic theory of matter, it is certainly most interesting  to remark that in the quasi-elasticity, elasticity looking like that of an  India-rubber band, which we see in a vibrating smoke-ring launched from an  elliptic aperture, or in two smoke-rings which were circular, but which  have become deformed from circularity by mutual collision, we have in  reality a virtual elasticity in matter devoid of elasticity, and even  devoid of rigidity, the virtual elasticity being due to motion, and  generated by the generation of motion.           *       *       *       *       *          APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY TO TRAMWAYS.    By M. HOLROYD SMITH.      Last year, when I had the pleasure of reading a paper before you on my new  system of electric tramways, I ventured to express the hope that before  twelve months had passed, \"to be able to report progress,\" and I am happy  to say that notwithstanding the wearisome delay and time lost in fruitless  negotiations, and the hundred and one difficulties within and without that  have beset me, I am able to appear before you again and tell you of  advance.    [Illustration: FIG. 1]    Practical men know well that there is a wide difference between a model and  a full sized machine; and when I decided to construct a full sized tramcar  and lay out a full sized track, I found it necessary to make many  alterations of detail, my chief difficulty being so to design my work as to  facilitate construction and allow of compensation for that inaccuracy of  workmanship which I have come to regard as inevitable.    In order to satisfy the directors of a tramway company of the practical  nature of my system before disturbing their lines, I have laid, in a field  near the works of Messrs. Smith, Baker & Co., Manchester, a track 110 yards  long, 4 ft. 81/2 in. gauge, and I have constructed a full sized street  tramcar to run thereon. My negotiations being with a company in a town  where there are no steep gradients, and where the coefficient of friction  of ordinary wheels would be sufficient for all tractive purposes, I thought  it better to avoid the complication involved in employing a large central  wheel with a broad surface specially designed for hilly districts, and with  which I had mounted a gradient of one in sixteen.    [Illustration: FIG. 2]    But as the line in question was laid with all the curves unnecessarily  quick, even those in the \"pass-bies,\" I thought it expedient to employ  differential gear, as illustrated at D, Fig. 1, which is a sketch plan  showing the mechanism employed. M is a Siemens electric motor running at  650 revolutions per minute; E is a combination of box gearing, frictional  clutch, and chain pinion, and from this pinion a steel chain passes around  the chain-wheel, H, which is free to revolve upon the axle, and carries  within it the differential pinion, gearing with the bevel-wheel, B squared, keyed  upon the sleeve of the loose tram-wheel, T squared, and with the bevel-wheel, B,  keyed upon the axle, to which the other tram-wheel, T, is attached. To the  other tram-wheels no gear is connected; one of them is fast to the axle,  and the other runs loose, but to them the brake is applied in the usual  manner.    The electric current from the collector passes, by means of a copper wire,  and a switch upon the dashboard of the car, and resistance coils placed  under the seats, to the motor, and from the motor by means of an adjustable  clip (illustrated in diagram, Fig. 2) to the axles, and by them through the  four wheels to the rails, which form the return circuit.    [Illustration: FIG. 3]    I have designed many modifications of the track, but it is, perhaps, best  at present to describe only that which I have in actual use, and it is  illustrated in diagram, Fig. 3, which is a sectional and perspective view  of the central channel. L is the surface of the road, and SS are the  sleepers, CC are the chairs which hold the angle iron, AA forming the  longitudinally slotted center rail and the electric lead, which consists of  two half-tubes of copper insulated from the chairs by the blocks, I, I. A  special brass clamp, free to slide upon the tube, is employed for this  purpose, and the same form of clamp serves to join the two ends of the  copper tubes together and to make electric contact. Two half-tubes instead  of one slotted tube have been employed, in order to leave a free passage  for dirt or wet to fall through the slot in the center rail to the drain  space, G. Between chair and chair hewn granite or artificial stone is  employed, formed, as shown in the drawing, to complete the surface of the  road and to form a continuous channel or drain. In order that this drain  may not become choked, at suitable intervals, in the length of the track,  sump holes are formed as illustrated in diagram, Fig. 4 These sump holes  have a well for the accumulation of mud, and are also connected with the  main street drain, so that water can freely pass away. The hand holes  afford facility for easily removing the dirt.    In a complete track these hand holes would occasionally be wider than shown  here, for the purpose of removing or fixing the collector, Fig. 5, which  consists of two sets of spirally fluted rollers free to revolve upon  spindles, which are held by knuckle-joints drawn together by spiral  springs; by this means the pressure of the rollers against the inside of  the tube is constantly maintained, and should any obstruction occur in the  tube the spiral flute causes it to revolve, thus automatically cleansing  the tubes.    [Illustration: FIG. 4]    The collector is provided with two steel plates, which pass through the  slit in the center rail; the lower ends of these plates are clamped by the  upper frame of the collector, insulating material being interposed, and the  upper ends are held in two iron cheeks. Between these steel plates  insulated copper strips are held, electrically connected with the collector  and with the adjustable clip mounted upon the iron cheeks; this clip holds  the terminal on the end of the wire (leading to the motor) firmly enough  for use, the cheeks being also provided with studs for the attachment of  leather straps hooked on to the framework of the car, one for the forward  and one for backward movement of the collector. These straps are strong  enough for the ordinary haulage of the collector, and for the removal of  pebbles and dirt that may get into the slit; but should any absolute block  occur then they break and the terminal is withdrawn from the clip; the  electric contact being thereby broken the car stops, the obstruction can  then be removed and the collector reconnected without damage and with  little delay.    [Illustration: FIG. 5]    In order to secure continuity of the center rail throughout the length of  the track, and still provide for the removal of the collector at frequent  intervals, the framework of the collector is so made that, by slackening  the side-bolts, the steel plates can be drawn upward and the collector  itself withdrawn sideways through the hand holes, one of the half-tubes  being removed for the purpose.    Fig. 6 illustrates another arrangement that I have constructed, both of  collector and method of collecting.    [Illustration: FIG. 6]    As before mentioned, the arrangement now described has been carried out in  a field near the works of Messrs. Smith, Baker & Co., Cornbrook Telegraph  Works, Manchester, and its working efficiency has been most satisfactory.  After a week of rain and during drenching showers the car ran with the same  speed and under the same control as when the ground was dry.    This I account for by the theory that when the rails are wet and the tubes  moist the better contact made compensates for the slight leakage that may  occur.    At the commencement of my paper I promised to confine myself to work done;  "]]]
