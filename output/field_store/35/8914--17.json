Gryphus pointed with his finger to the bed on which the martyr had  suffered so much, who on that day had rendered his soul to God. Then,  taking up his cresset, he quitted the cell.    Thus left alone, Cornelius threw himself on his bed, but he slept not,  he kept his eye fixed on the narrow window, barred with iron, which  looked on the Buytenhof; and in this way saw from behind the trees that  first pale beam of light which morning sheds on the earth as a white  mantle.    Now and then during the night horses had galloped at a smart pace over  the Buytenhof, the heavy tramp of the patrols had resounded from the  pavement, and the slow matches of the arquebuses, flaring in the east  wind, had thrown up at intervals a sudden glare as far as to the panes  of his window.    But when the rising sun began to gild the coping stones at the gable  ends of the houses, Cornelius, eager to know whether there was any  living creature about him, approached the window, and cast a sad look  round the circular yard before him.    At the end of the yard a dark mass, tinted with a dingy blue by the  morning dawn, rose before him, its dark outlines standing out in  contrast to the houses already illuminated by the pale light of early  morning.    Cornelius recognised the gibbet.    On it were suspended two shapeless trunks, which indeed were no more  than bleeding skeletons.    The good people of the Hague had chopped off the flesh of its victims,  but faithfully carried the remainder to the gibbet, to have a pretext  for a double inscription written on a huge placard, on which Cornelius;  with the keen sight of a young man of twenty-eight, was able to read the  following lines, daubed by the coarse brush of a sign-painter:--    \"Here are hanging the great rogue of the name of John de Witt, and the  little rogue Cornelius de Witt, his brother, two enemies of the people,  but great friends of the king of France.\"    Cornelius uttered a cry of horror, and in the agony of his frantic  terror knocked with his hands and feet at the door so violently and  continuously, that Gryphus, with his huge bunch of keys in his hand, ran  furiously up.    The jailer opened the door, with terrible imprecations against the  prisoner who disturbed him at an hour which Master Gryphus was not  accustomed to be aroused.    \"Well, now, by my soul, he is mad, this new De Witt,\" he cried, \"but all  those De Witts have the devil in them.\"    \"Master, master,\" cried Cornelius, seizing the jailer by the arm and  dragging him towards the window,--\"master, what have I read down there?\"    \"Where down there?\"    \"On that placard.\"    And, trembling, pale, and gasping for breath, he pointed to the gibbet  at the other side of the yard, with the cynical inscription surmounting  it.    Gryphus broke out into a laugh.    \"Eh! eh!\" he answered, \"so, you have read it. Well, my good sir, that's  what people will get for corresponding with the enemies of his Highness  the Prince of Orange.\"    \"The brothers De Witt are murdered!\" Cornelius muttered, with the cold  sweat on his brow, and sank on his bed, his arms hanging by his side,  and his eyes closed.    \"The brothers De Witt have been judged by the people,\" said Gryphus;  \"you call that murdered, do you? well, I call it executed.\"    And seeing that the prisoner was not only quiet, but entirely prostrate  and senseless, he rushed from the cell, violently slamming the door, and  noisily drawing the bolts.    Recovering his consciousness, Cornelius found himself alone, and  recognised the room where he was,--\"the family cell,\" as Gryphus had  called it,--as the fatal passage leading to ignominious death.    And as he was a philosopher, and, more than that, as he was a Christian,  he began to pray for the soul of his godfather, then for that of the  Grand Pensionary, and at last submitted with resignation to all the  sufferings which God might ordain for him.    Then turning again to the concerns of earth, and having satisfied  himself that he was alone in his dungeon, he drew from his breast the  three bulbs of the black tulip, and concealed them behind a block of  stone, on which the traditional water-jug of the prison was standing, in  the darkest corner of his cell.    Useless labour of so many years! such sweet hopes crushed; his discovery  was, after all, to lead to naught, just as his own career was to be cut  short. Here, in his prison, there was not a trace of vegetation, not an  atom of soil, not a ray of sunshine.    At this thought Cornelius fell into a gloomy despair, from which he was  only aroused by an extraordinary circumstance.    What was this circumstance?    We shall inform the reader in our next chapter.          Chapter 10. The Jailer's Daughter      On the same evening Gryphus, as he brought the prisoner his mess,  slipped on the damp flags whilst opening the door of the cell, and fell,  in the attempt to steady himself, on his hand; but as it was turned the  wrong way, he broke his arm just above the wrist.    Cornelius rushed forward towards the jailer, but Gryphus, who was not  yet aware of the serious nature of his injury, called out to him,--    \"It is nothing: don't you stir.\"    He then tried to support himself on his arm, but the bone gave way; then  only he felt the pain, and uttered a cry.    When he became aware that his arm was broken, this man, so harsh to  others, fell swooning on the threshold, where he remained motionless and  cold, as if dead.    During all this time the door of the cell stood open and Cornelius found  himself almost free. But the thought never entered his mind of profiting  by this accident; he had seen from the manner in which the arm was bent,  and from the noise it made in bending, that the bone was fractured, and  that the patient must be in great pain; and now he thought of nothing  else but of administering relief to the sufferer, however little  benevolent the man had shown himself during their short interview.    At the noise of Gryphus's fall, and at the cry which escaped him, a  hasty step was heard on the staircase, and immediately after a lovely  apparition presented itself to the eyes of Cornelius.    It was the beautiful young Frisian, who, seeing her father stretched on  the ground, and the prisoner bending over him, uttered a faint cry, as  in the first fright she thought Gryphus, whose brutality she well knew,  had fallen in consequence of a struggle between him and the prisoner.    Cornelius understood what was passing in the mind of the girl, at the  very moment when the suspicion arose in her heart.    But one moment told her the true state of the case and, ashamed of her  first thoughts, she cast her beautiful eyes, wet with tears, on the  young man, and said to him,--    \"I beg your pardon, and thank you, sir; the first for what I have  thought, and the second for what you are doing.\"    Cornelius blushed, and said, \"I am but doing my duty as a Christian in  helping my neighbour.\"    \"Yes, and affording him your help this evening, you have forgotten the  abuse which he heaped on you this morning. Oh, sir! this is more than  humanity,--this is indeed Christian charity.\"    Cornelius cast his eyes on the beautiful girl, quite astonished to hear  from the mouth of one so humble such a noble and feeling speech.    But he had no time to express his surprise. Gryphus recovered from his  swoon, opened his eyes, and as his brutality was returning with his  senses, he growled \"That's it, a fellow is in a hurry to bring to a  prisoner his supper, and falls and breaks his arm, and is left lying on  the ground.\"    \"Hush, my father,\" said Rosa, \"you are unjust to this gentleman, whom I  found endeavouring to give you his aid.\"    \"His aid?\" Gryphus replied, with a doubtful air.    \"It is quite true, master! I am quite ready to help you still more.\"    \"You!\" said Gryphus, \"are you a medical man?\"    \"It was formerly my profession.\"    \"And so you would be able to set my arm?\"    \"Perfectly.\"    \"And what would you need to do it? let us hear.\"    \"Two splinters of wood, and some linen for a bandage.\"    \"Do you hear, Rosa?\" said Gryphus, \"the prisoner is going to set my arm,  that's a saving; come, assist me to get up, I feel as heavy as lead.\"    Rosa lent the sufferer her shoulder; he put his unhurt arm around her  neck, and making an effort, got on his legs, whilst Cornelius, to save  him a walk, pushed a chair towards him.    Gryphus sat down; then, turning towards his daughter, he said,--    \"Well, didn't you hear? go and fetch what is wanted.\"    Rosa went down, and immediately after returned with two staves of a  small barrel and a large roll of linen bandage.    Cornelius had made use of the intervening moments to take off the man's  coat, and to tuck up his shirt sleeve.    \"Is this what you require, sir?\" asked Rosa.    \"Yes, mademoiselle,\" answered Cornelius, looking at the things she had  brought,--\"yes, that's right. Now push this table, whilst I support the  arm of your father.\"    Rosa pushed the table, Cornelius placed the broken arm on it so as  to make it flat, and with perfect skill set the bone, adjusted the  splinters, and fastened the bandages.    At the last touch, the jailer fainted a second time.    \"Go and fetch vinegar, mademoiselle,\" said Cornelius; \"we will bathe his  temples, and he will recover.\"    But, instead of acting up to the doctor's prescription, Rosa, after  having satisfied herself that her father was still unconscious,  approached Cornelius and said,--    \"Service for service, sir.\"    \"What do you mean, my pretty child?\" said Cornelius.    \"I mean to say, sir, that the judge who is to examine you to-morrow has  inquired to-day for the room in which you are confined, and, on being  told that you are occupying the cell of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],[0,"Independent Bohemia (#15)"],[1,"zecho-Slovak Council  without the powers of a real government. At the beginning of the war the  Czecho-Slovaks not only had no government of their own, but not even any  united organisation. And if we realise that to-day, after three and a half  years of strenuous effort, the National Council are recognised by the  Allies as the Provisional Government of Bohemia with the right of  exercising all powers appertaining to a real government, including the  control of an army as large as Great Britain had at the outbreak of the  war, it must be admitted that the action of the Czecho-Slovaks abroad was  crowned with wonderful success.    In Russia the difficulties with which the National Council had to cope were  especially grave, and mainly for two reasons. In the first place, the  Czecho-Slovak prisoners who voluntarily surrendered were scattered all over  Russia. It was extremely difficult even to get into touch with them. In  addition there was a lack of good-will on the part of the old Russian  Government. Thus very often these prisoners, who regarded Russia as  Bohemia's elder brother and liberator, were sadly disillusioned when they  were left under the supervision of some German officers, and thousands of  them died from starvation. Nevertheless they never despaired. Eager to  fight for the Allies, many of them entered the Yugoslav Division which  fought so gallantly in the Dobrudja. Nearly all the Czech officers in this  division were decorated with the highest Russian, Serbian and Rumanian  orders. Half of them committed suicide, however, during the retreat rather  than fall into the hands of the enemy.    It was not until after the Russian Revolution, and especially after the  arrival of Professor Masaryk in Russia in May, 1917, that the Czecho-Slovak  army in Russia became a reality.    The Czecho-Slovaks have been mentioned in Russian official _communiques_ of  February 2, 1916, and March 29, 1917. The most glorious part was taken by  the Czecho-Slovak Brigade during the last Russian offensive in July, 1917,  in which the Czechs showed manifestly the indomitable spirit that animates  them. Since every Czech fighting on the side of the Entente is shot, if he  is captured by the Austrians, the Czechs everywhere fight to the bitter  end, and rather commit suicide than be captured by their enemies. For this  reason they are justly feared by the Germans. As in the Hussite wars, the  sight of their caps and the sound of their songs struck terror in the  hearts of the Germans and Magyars. At the battle of Zborov on July 2, 1917,  the Czechs gave the whole world proof of their bravery. Determined to win  or fall, they launched an attack almost without ammunition, with bayonets  and hand-grenades--and they gained a victory over an enemy vastly superior  in numbers.    According to the official Russian _communique_:        \"On July 2, at about three o'clock in the afternoon, after a severe and      stubborn battle, the gallant troops of the Czecho-Slovak Brigade      occupied the strongly fortified enemy position on the heights to the      west and south-west of the village of Zborov and the fortified village      of Koroszylow. Three lines of enemy trenches were penetrated. The enemy      has retired across the Little Strypa. The Czecho-Slovak Brigade      captured sixty-two officers and 3150 soldiers, fifteen guns and many      machine guns. Many of the captured guns were turned against the enemy.\"    Finally, however, when the Russians refused to fight, the Czechs had to  retire as well. General Brussiloff declared:        \"The Czecho-Slovaks, perfidiously abandoned at Tarnopol by our      infantry, fought in such a way that the world ought to fall on its      knees before them.\"    2. The spontaneous and unanimous political action of the Czecho-Slovaks  abroad became co-ordinated when Professor Masaryk escaped from Austria and  placed himself at the head of the movement.    _Professor Masaryk_, the distinguished Czech leader and scholar, whose name  we have already mentioned in the preceding chapters, went to Italy in  December, 1914, and although he desired once more to return to Austria  before leaving finally for France, he found it too dangerous, as the reign  of terror had already been established in Bohemia. He accordingly went to  Switzerland and afterwards on to France and England. In October, 1915, he  was appointed lecturer at the newly founded School of Slavonic Studies at  King's College, University of London. Mr. Asquith, then Prime Minister, who  was prevented through indisposition from presiding at Professor Masaryk's  inaugural lecture on October 19, 1915, sent the following message to  the meeting:        \"I congratulate King's College on Professor Masaryk's appointment, and      I can assure him that we welcome his advent to London both as a      teacher--the influence of whose power and learning is felt throughout      the Slav world--and as a man to whose personal qualities of candour,      courage and strength we are all glad to pay a tribute. We believe that      his presence here will be a link to strengthen the sympathy which      unites the people of Russia and Great Britain.\"        \"First and foremost the Allies are fighting for the liberties of small      nations, to the end that they may be left in future free from the      tyranny of their more powerful neighbours to develop their own national      life and institutions. Above all, to-day our thoughts and our      sympathies are moved towards Serbia, whose undaunted courage wins day      by day our unbounded sympathy and admiration.\"    During the lecture on the Problem of Small Nations in the European Crisis,  Professor Masaryk outlined his political programme which he has ever since  insisted the Allies should adopt, to destroy the German plans of  Mitteleuropa. He declared:        \"Great Britain came into this war to protect little Belgium, and now      with her Allies she is faced by the task of protecting Serbia. This      evolution of the war is almost logical, for Germany's aim is and was      Berlin--Bagdad, the employment of the nations of Austria-Hungary as      helpless instruments, and the subjection of the smaller nations which      form that peculiar zone between the west and east of Europe. _Poland,      Bohemia, Serbo-Croatia (the South Slavs) are the natural adversaries of      Germany_, of her _Drang nach Osten_; to liberate and strengthen these      smaller nations is the only real check upon Prussia. Free Poland,      Bohemia and Serbo-Croatia would be so-called buffer states, their      organisation would facilitate and promote the formation of a Magyar      state, of Greater Rumania, of Bulgaria, Greece and the rest of the      smaller nations. If this horrible war, with its countless victims, has      any meaning, it can only be found in the liberation of the small      nations who are menaced by Germany's eagerness for conquest and her      thirst for the dominion of Asia. The Oriental question is to be solved      on the Rhine, Moldau and Vistula, not only on the Danube, Vardar and      Maritza.\"    Soon afterwards Professor Masaryk issued a proclamation signed by  representatives of all Czecho-Slovaks abroad, the full text of which reads  as follows:        \"We come before the political public at a moment when the retreat of      the victorious Russian army is exploited against Russia and her Allies.      We take the side of the struggling Slav nations and their Allies      without regard to which party will be victorious, simply because the      Allies' cause is just. The decision as to which party in this fatal      struggle is defending the right, is a question of principle and      political morality which to-day cannot be evaded by any honest and      clear-thinking politician nor by any self-conscious nation. But we are      prompted to step forward also by our vivid sense of Slav solidarity: we      express our ardent sympathies to our brother Serbs and Russians, as      well as to our brother Poles, so heavily struck by the war. We believe      in the ultimate victory of the Slavs and their Allies, and we are      convinced that this victory will contribute towards the welfare of the      whole of Europe and humanity. The spiteful anti-Slav attitude of      Ferdinand the Koburg and his government cannot retard the victory of a      just cause.        \"The Czech nation made an alliance with Hungary and the Austrian      Germans by a free election of a Habsburg to the throne of the kingdom      of Bohemia in 1526; but the dynasty created through a systematic      centralisation and germanisation a unitary absolutist state, thus      violating their treaty guaranteeing the independence of the Bohemian      State within and without. The Czech nation, exhausted by the European      and Habsburg anti-reformation, has only since the Czech regeneration at      the end of the eighteenth century been able to resist this violence. It      was especially the revolution of 1848 which challenged it.        \"The revolution was crushed, and the secured rights of nations,      especially of the Czechs, were again sacrificed to absolutism which,      however, was shattered by the war of 1859, and replaced by an      incomplete constitutionalism. Then Vienna gave way to the Magyars. But      the Czechs had to content themselves with solemn promises that were      never kept. The Czech nation started a struggle of passive opposition.      Later on it also took an active part in the new parliament, but whether      in parliament or in the diets, it always claimed its historic right of      independence and struggled against the German-Magyar dualism. The      attempts made to come to an understanding were frustrated by the      obstinate spirit of domination of the Germans and Magyars.        \"The present war has only accentuated the Czecho-Slovak opposition to      Austria-Hungary.
