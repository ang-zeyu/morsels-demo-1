I  submit that it is not very easy--and I have gone into the question  very carefully--to divide these lower castes and to classify them.  Statisticians would be charged with putting too many into either one  or the other division, wherever you choose to draw the line. I know  the force of the argument, and am willing to attach to it whatever  weight it deserves. I wish some of my friends in this country would  study the figures of what are called the lower castes, because they  would then see the enormous difficulty and absurdity of applying to  India the same principles that are excellent guides to us Westerns who  have been bred on the pure milk of the Benthamite word--one man one  vote and every man a vote. That dream, by the way, is not quite  realised even in this country; but the idea of insisting on a  principle of that sort is irrational to anybody who reflects on this  multiplicity and variety of race and castes.    Then there is the question of the joint electorate--what is called the  mixed electoral college. I was very glad to read this paragraph in the  paper that you were good enough to send to me. You recognise the very  principle that was at the back of our minds, when we came to the  conclusion about mixed electoral college. You say:--\"In common with  other well-wishers of India, the Committee look forward to a time when  the development of a true spirit of compromise, or the fusion of  the races, may make principles indicated by his Lordship capable of  practical application without sacrificing the interests of any of  the nationalities, or giving political ascendency to one to the  disadvantage of the others. But the Committee venture to think that,  however ready the country may be for constitutional reforms, the  interests of the two great communities of India must be considered  and dealt with separately.\" Therefore, to begin with, the difference  between us in principle about the joint electorate is only this: we  are guilty of nothing worse than that we were premature, in the views  of these gentlemen--we were impatient idealists. You say to me, \"It is  very fine; we hope it will all come true; but you are premature;  we must wait.\" Still, though premature, I observe that your own  suggestion in one of those papers adopts and accepts the principle of  the scheme outlined in our despatch. It is quite true to say, \"Oh,  but you are vague in your despatch.\" Yes, a despatch is not a Bill.  A Minister writing a despatch does not put in all the clauses and  sections and subsections and schedules. It is the business of a  Minister composing a despatch like mine of November 27, 1908, to  indicate only general lines--general enough to make the substance and  body of the scheme intelligible, but still general. I should like to  say a word about the despatch. It is constantly assumed that in the  despatch we prescribed and ordered the introduction of the joint  electoral college. If any of you will be good enough to look at the  words, you will find that no language of that sort--no law of the  Medes and Persians--is to be found in it. If you refer to paragraph 12  you will see that our language is this:--    \"I suggest for your consideration that the object in view might be  better secured, at any rate in the more advanced provinces in India,  by a modification of the system of popular electorate founded on the  principle of electoral colleges.\"    You see it was merely a suggestion thrown out for the Government of  India, not a direction of the Mede and Persian stamp. You say, \"That  for the purpose of electing members to the Provincial Councils,  electoral colleges should be constituted on lines suggested by his  Lordship, composed exclusively of Mahomedans whose numbers and mode of  grouping should be fixed by executive authority.\" This comes within  the principle of my despatch, and we shall see--I hope very  speedily--whether the Government of India discover objections to its  practicability. Mark, electoral colleges \"composed exclusively of  Mahomedans whose members and mode of grouping should be fixed by  executive authority\"--that is a proposition which is not outside the  despatch. Whether practicable or not, it is a matter for discussion  between us here and the Government in India.    The aim of the Government and yours is identical--that there shall  be (to quote Mr. Ameer Ali's words) \"adequate, real, and genuine  Mahomedan representation.\" Now, where is the difference between us?  The machinery we commended, you do not think possible. As I have  told you, the language of the despatch does not insist upon a mixed  electoral college. It would be no departure in substance from the  purpose of our suggestion, that there should be a separate Mahomedan  electorate--an electorate exclusively Mahomedan; and in view of  the wide and remote distances, and difficulties of organisation in  consequence of those distances in the area constituting a large  province, I am not sure that this is not one of those cases where  election by two stages would not be convenient, and so there might be  a separate electoral college exclusively Mahomedan. That is, I take  it, in accordance with your own proposal. There are various methods by  which it could be done. In the first place, an election exclusively  Mahomedan might be direct into the legislative council. To this it  may be said that it would be impossible by reason of distance. In the  second place, you could have an election by separate communities to a  local board, and the local board should be the electoral college, the  Mahomedans separating themselves from the other members of the board  for that purpose. Thirdly, the members of the local board, the  communities being separate in the same way, could return a member for  the electoral college. Fourthly, you might have a direct election to  an electoral college by the community, and this electoral college  would return a representative to the legislative council. These, you  see, are four different expedients which well deserve consideration  for attaining our end.    I go to the next point, the apprehensions lest if we based our system  on numerical strength alone, a great injustice would be done to  your community. Of course we all considered that, from the Viceroy  downwards. Whether your apprehensions are well founded or not, it is  the business of those who call themselves statesmen to take those  apprehensions into account, and to do the best we can in setting up  a working system to allay and meet such apprehensions. If you take  numerical strength as your basis, in the Punjab and Eastern Bengal  Mahomedans are in a decisive majority. In the Punjab the Moslem  population is 53 per cent. to 38 per cent. Hindu. In Eastern Bengal 58  per cent. are Moslem and 37 per cent. are Hindu. Therefore, in those  two provinces, on the numerical basis alone, the Mahomedans will  secure sufficient representation. In Madras, on the other hand,  the Hindus are 89 per cent. against 6 per cent. of Moslems, and,  therefore, numbers would give no adequate representation to Moslem  opinion. In Bombay the Moslems are in the ratio of 3-3/4 to 14  millions--20 per cent. to 77 per cent. The conditions are very complex  in Bombay, and I need not labour the details of this complexity. I am  inclined to agree with those who think that it might be left to  the local Government to take other elements into view required or  suggested by local conditions. Coming to the United Provinces, there  the Moslems are 6-3/4 millions to 40-3/4 Hindus--14 per cent. to 85  per cent. This ratio of numerical strength no more represents the  proportion in the elements of weight and importance, than in Eastern  Bengal does the Hindu ratio of 37 per cent. to 58 per cent. of  Moslems. You may set off each of those two cases against the other.  Then there is the great province of Bengal, where the Moslems are  one-quarter of the Hindus--9 millions to 39 millions--18 per cent. to  77 per cent.    We all see, then, that the problem presents extraordinary difficulty.  How are you going in a case like the United Provinces, for example, to  secure that adequate and substantial representation, which it is the  interest and the desire of the Government for its own sake to secure.  No fair-minded Moslem would deny in Eastern Bengal, any more than a  fair-minded non-Moslem would deny it in the United Provinces, that  there is no easy solution. You see, gentlemen, I do not despair  of finding a fair-minded man in a controversy of this kind. From  information that reaches me I do not at all despair of meeting  fair-minded critics of both communities, in spite of the sharp  antagonism that exists on many matters between them. But, whatever may  be the case with Mahomedans and Hindus, there is one body of men  who are bound to keep a fair mind, and that is the Government. The  Government are bound, whatever you may do among yourselves, strictly,  and I will even say sternly, to insist on overcoming all obstacles  in a spirit of absolute equity. Now, what is the object of the  Government? It is that the Legislative Councils should represent truly  and effectively, with a reasonable approach to the balance of real  social forces, the wishes and needs of the communities themselves.  That is the object of the Government, and in face of a great problem  of that kind, algebra, arithmetic, geometry, logic--none of these  things will do your business for you. You have to look at it widely  and away from those sciences, excellent in their place, but not of  much service when you are solving awkward political riddles. I think  if you allow some method of leaving to a local authority the power of  adding to the number of representatives from the Mahomedan community,  or the Hindu community, as the case may be, that might be a possible  and prudent way of getting through this embarrassment. Let us all be  clear of one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#16)"],[1,"presents. I have watched them under many tempting circumstances,  and never found them steal. It is my firm conviction that dishonesty  is chiefly the effect of neglect. No child can be _born_ a _thief_,  in the strict sense of the term. In many schools, too, there are  fruit-trees planted in the play-ground, to which the children will not  do the least injury, nor will they touch the fruit. Flowers in pots,  such as geraniums, auriculas, and other plants, are placed in the  middle of the play-ground, without the least danger of being injured.  Such is their respect to private property.    Another instance particularly excited my notice amongst the children  in the first establishments in London. They were permitted to bring  their dinners with them, and there were boxes in the school to put  them in. Every child in the school had access to these boxes, for they  were never locked, and yet I never knew a child to lose his dinner, or  any part of it, notwithstanding many of the children, to my knowledge,  had been kept extremely short of food. I have known an instance of a  slice of bread and butter being left in the box for several weeks, by  some child that could not eat it, but none of the other children would  dare to touch it. I have found in the boxes two or three pieces of  bread, as hard as possible, and as a proof that many were hungry, and  that it did not remain there because they could not eat it, but out of  pure honesty, I have offered it to some of the children, and they have  eaten it in that state. Cold potatoes, pieces of fat, &c., were not  unacceptable to them when given; but sooner than take any thing  without leave, they have actually left it to spoil. These are facts  which shew, that notwithstanding all the disadvantages to which the  poor children are exposed, their character may be so far formed as to  produce the effects above described. \"Would you take a piece of bread  out of this box that did not belong to you?\" said I to the children  one day. \"No, sir,\" replied a little girl of four years old. \"Why  not?\" \"Because,\" said the child, \"it would be thieving.\" \"Well, but  suppose no one saw you?\" Before I could speak another word, a number  of the children answered, \"God can see everything that we do.\" \"Yes,\"  added another little boy, \"if you steal a cherry, or a piece of  pencil, it is wicked.\" \"To be sure,\" added another, \"it is wicked to  steal any thing.\"    I cannot do better than introduce in this place the opinion of Judge  Bosanquet, on the subject of the education of the infant poor; and  some valuable hints will likewise be found in his remarks on prison  discipline. It is an extract from a charge to the jury delivered at  the Gloucester assizes for April, 1823. \"Gentlemen, I have reason to  believe, that the offences for trial on this occasion, are rather less  than usual at this season, and, to whatever the diminution of crime  may be ascribed, I cannot forbear earnestly to press upon your  attention, a constant perseverance in two things, _which, above all  others, are calculated to diminish crime_,--the first is an unremitted  attention to the education of the children of the poor, and of all  classes of society, in the principles of true morality and sound  religion; the next is the constant and regular employment of such  persons as may be sentenced to imprisonment, in such labour as may be  adapted to their respective ages and conditions. I believe that these  observations may be considered as quite superfluous in this county,  and therefore I have taken the liberty of using the word perseverance,  because I believe your attention is already strongly drawn to that  subject, and it requires no exhortation of mine to induce your  attention to it. I am not quite sure whether in the gaol for this  city, the same means are provided for the employment of those persons  sentenced to terms of imprisonment, which are provided in the gaol  for the county. The magistrates for the city are equally desirous of  promoting the education of all the poor under their care, I have no  doubt; and I do hope and trust, if the means of labour have not been  provided in their gaol, that no time will be lost in providing those  means by which imprisonment may be made a real punishment, by which  offenders may be reformed during their imprisonment, and by which the  idle and dissolute may be prevented from any inclination to return  there.\"[A]    [Footnote A: From the time the judge referred to made the above  remarks, other judges, down to the present time, have added similar  sentiments. From 1823, until 1852, proof upon proof, has been added,  to show us the advantage of early training; and though much has been  cramming, and not training, still the results have been good. What  would they have been had the schooling given, really been _training?_  and what, if the training of children had been studied as _art_, if  the public looked on the teachers as artists, and treated them with  the consideration they deserve? Anticipations cannot be too sanguine  in estimating the results that must accrue to society from a system of  spiritual, intellectual, and moral culture, becoming universal, and  worked out by minds who will, I am sure hereafter, be able fully to  develope, from study, and practice of the _art_ of teaching, the great  principles of spiritual truths, intellectual vigour, and the moral  strength of the coming generations, which have been allowed to remain  in a state of torpor in the present.]    I have hitherto only being considering the _prudential_ motives which  should induce us to promote the education of the poor. I have shown,  that it will be for the benefit of society, inasmuch as it is likely  to decrease the number of those who transgress its laws--that it will  prove a greater security to our persons and property than laws or  prisons afford. But there are other motives which, if these selfish  ones were wholly wanting, might be sufficient to advocate, in every  humane heart, the same course of conduct. If the duty of promoting  honesty amongst the labouring classes did not exist, that of  increasing happiness and piety amongst them would not be the less  imperative. That there is much room for an augmentation of both, few,  I think, will be inclined to deny; the less so in proportion as  they have had the greater opportunity of ascertaining their actual  condition.    Let us now for a few moments consider how great a blessing an infant  school is, even when regarded as a mere asylum to take charge of the  child's bodily welfare. I have mentioned before, that the poor are  unable to take that care of their children which their tender age  requires, on account of their occupations; and have shewn, that it is  almost certain, that the children of such persons will learn every  species of vice. But there are other kinds of dangers which more  immediately affect the body, and are the cause of more accidents  than people in general imagine. I shall here notice some of the most  prominent, and hope to be able to convince the unprejudiced mind, that  it would be a charity to take charge of the infant poor, even leaving  the idea of their learning any thing good at school entirely out of  the question; and surely those persons, who disapprove of educating  the poor at all, will see the propriety of keeping, if possible, their  children safe from accidents, and preserving the lives of many little  ones, who would otherwise be lost to their country, from their falling  a prey to surrounding dangers.    It is well known that many poor people are obliged to live in garrets,  three or four stories high, with a family of six or seven children;  and it will not appear improbable that, when the children are left by  themselves, they should frequently meet with accidents by tumbling  down stairs; some breaking their backs, others their legs or arms;  and to this cause alone, perhaps, may be traced a vast number of the  cripples that daily appear as mendicants in our streets. When the  poor parents return from their daily labour, they sometimes have the  mortification of finding that one, or probably two, of their children,  are gone to an hospital; which of course makes them unhappy, and  unfits them for going through their daily labour. This dead weight,  which is continually on the minds of parents, is frequently the cause  of their being unable to please their employers, and the consequence  sometimes is, they are thrown out of work altogether; whereas, if  they were certain that their children were taken care of, they would  proceed with their daily labour cheerfully, and be enabled to give  more satisfaction to their employers than they otherwise can do.    Other parents I have known, who, when obliged to go out, have locked  their children in a room to prevent them from getting into the street,  or falling down stairs, and who have taken every precaution, as  they imagined, to protect their children; but the little creatures,  perhaps, after fretting and crying for hours at being thus confined,  have ventured to get up to the window, in order to see what was  passing in the street, when one, over-reaching itself, has fallen out  and been killed on the spot. A gentleman said, at a public meeting at  Exeter, when referring to this subject, \"I have myself, twice in my  life, nearly occasioned the death of children. In one instance, a  child left to itself, ran out of the hedge by the road-side; I was  fortunately able to stop, and found the child, unconscious of its  escape, raising its hands to the reins of the horse. And on another  occasion, my horse threw a child down, and I had but just time to pull  up, and prevent the wheels from passing over the infant's head.\" And  it was stated in a Bristol paper, that in the short space of _one  fortnight, seven_ children were taken to the infirmary of that city so  dreadfully burnt that four of them died.
