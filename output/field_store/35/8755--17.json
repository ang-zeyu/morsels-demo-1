But I have  children of my own, who long for a visit from Santa Claus, and I have  come to beg that you will favor them hereafter as you do other  children.\"    Claus was pleased with this speech, for Castle Braun was the only place  he had never visited, and he gladly promised to bring presents to the  Baron's children the next Christmas Eve.    The Baron went away contented, and Claus kept his promise faithfully.    Thus did this man, through very goodness, conquer the hearts of all;  and it is no wonder he was ever merry and gay, for there was no home in  the wide world where he was not welcomed more royally than any king.          OLD AGE        1.  The Mantle of Immortality    And now we come to a turning-point in the career of Santa Claus, and it  is my duty to relate the most remarkable that has happened since the  world began or mankind was created.    We have followed the life of Claus from the time he was found a  helpless infant by the Wood-Nymph Necile and reared to manhood in the  great Forest of Burzee.  And we know how he began to make toys for  children and how, with the assistance and goodwill of the immortals, he  was able to distribute them to the little ones throughout the world.    For many years he carried on this noble work; for the simple,  hard-working life he led gave him perfect health and strength.  And  doubtless a man can live longer in the beautiful Laughing Valley, where  there are no cares and everything is peaceful and merry, than in any  other part of the world.    But when many years had rolled away Santa Claus grew old.  The long  beard of golden brown that once covered his cheeks and chin gradually  became gray, and finally turned to pure white.  His hair was white,  too, and there were wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, which showed  plainly when he laughed.  He had never been a very tall man, and now he  became fat, and waddled very much like a duck when he walked.  But in  spite of these things he remained as lively as ever, and was just as  jolly and gay, and his kind eyes sparkled as brightly as they did that  first day when he came to the Laughing Valley.    Yet a time is sure to come when every mortal who has grown old and  lived his life is required to leave this world for another; so it is no  wonder that, after Santa Claus had driven his reindeer on many and many  a Christmas Eve, those stanch friends finally whispered among  themselves that they had probably drawn his sledge for the last time.    Then all the Forest of Burzee became sad and all the Laughing Valley  was hushed; for every living thing that had known Claus had used to  love him and to brighten at the sound of his footsteps or the notes of  his merry whistle.    No doubt the old man's strength was at last exhausted, for he made no  more toys, but lay on his bed as in a dream.    The Nymph Necile, she who had reared him and been his foster-mother,  was still youthful and strong and beautiful, and it seemed to her but a  short time since this aged, gray-bearded man had lain in her arms and  smiled on her with his innocent, baby lips.    In this is shown the difference between mortals and immortals.    It was fortunate that the great Ak came to the Forest at this time.  Necile sought him with troubled eyes and told him of the fate that  threatened their friend Claus.    At once the Master became grave, and he leaned upon his ax and stroked  his grizzled beard thoughtfully for many minutes.  Then suddenly he  stood up straight, and poised his powerful head with firm resolve, and  stretched out his great right arm as if determined on doing some mighty  deed.  For a thought had come to him so grand in its conception that  all the world might well bow before the Master Woodsman and honor his  name forever!    It is well known that when the great Ak once undertakes to do a thing  he never hesitates an instant.  Now he summoned his fleetest  messengers, and sent them in a flash to many parts of the earth.  And  when they were gone he turned to the anxious Necile and comforted her,  saying:    \"Be of good heart, my child; our friend still lives.  And now run to  your Queen and tell her that I have summoned a council of all the  immortals of the world to meet with me here in Burzee this night.  If  they obey, and harken unto my words, Claus will drive his reindeer for  countless ages yet to come.\"    At midnight there was a wondrous scene in the ancient Forest of Burzee,  where for the first time in many centuries the rulers of the immortals  who inhabit the earth were gathered together.    There was the Queen of the Water Sprites, whose beautiful form was as  clear as crystal but continually dripped water on the bank of moss  where she sat.  And beside her was the King of the Sleep Fays, who  carried a wand from the end of which a fine dust fell all around, so  that no mortal could keep awake long enough to see him, as mortal eyes  were sure to close in sleep as soon as the dust filled them.  And next  to him sat the Gnome King, whose people inhabit all that region under  the earth's surface, where they guard the precious metals and the jewel  stones that lie buried in rock and ore.  At his right hand stood the  King of the Sound Imps, who had wings on his feet, for his people are  swift to carry all sounds that are made.  When they are busy they carry  the sounds but short distances, for there are many of them; but  sometimes they speed with the sounds to places miles and miles away  from where they are made.  The King of the Sound Imps had an anxious  and careworn face, for most people have no consideration for his Imps  and, especially the boys and girls, make a great many unnecessary  sounds which the Imps are obliged to carry when they might be better  employed.    The next in the circle of immortals was the King of the Wind Demons,  slender of frame, restless and uneasy at being confined to one place  for even an hour.  Once in a while he would leave his place and circle  around the glade, and each time he did this the Fairy Queen was obliged  to untangle the flowing locks of her golden hair and tuck them back of  her pink ears.  But she did not complain, for it was not often that the  King of the Wind Demons came into the heart of the Forest.  After the  Fairy Queen, whose home you know was in old Burzee, came the King of  the Light Elves, with his two Princes, Flash and Twilight, at his back.  He never went anywhere without his Princes, for they were so  mischievous that he dared not let them wander alone.    Prince Flash bore a lightning-bolt in his right hand and a horn of  gunpowder in his left, and his bright eyes roved constantly around, as  if he longed to use his blinding flashes.  Prince Twilight held a great  snuffer in one hand and a big black cloak in the other, and it is well  known that unless Twilight is carefully watched the snuffers or the  cloak will throw everything into darkness, and Darkness is the greatest  enemy the King of the Light Elves has.    In addition to the immortals I have named were the King of the Knooks,  who had come from his home in the jungles of India; and the King of the  Ryls, who lived among the gay flowers and luscious fruits of Valencia.  Sweet Queen Zurline of the Wood-Nymphs completed the circle of  immortals.    But in the center of the circle sat three others who possessed powers  so great that all the Kings and Queens showed them reverence.    These were Ak, the Master Woodsman of the World, who rules the forests  and the orchards and the groves; and Kern, the Master Husbandman of the  World, who rules the grain fields and the meadows and the gardens; and  Bo, the Master Mariner of the World, who rules the seas and all the  craft that float thereon.  And all other immortals are more or less  subject to these three.    When all had assembled the Master Woodsman of the World stood up to  address them, since he himself had summoned them to the council.    Very clearly he told them the story of Claus, beginning at the time  when as a babe he had been adopted a child of the Forest, and telling  of his noble and generous nature and his life-long labors to make  children happy.    \"And now,\" said Ak, \"when he had won the love of all the world, the  Spirit of Death is hovering over him.  Of all men who have inhabited  the earth none other so well deserves immortality, for such a life can  not be spared so long as there are children of mankind to miss him and  to grieve over his loss.  We immortals are the servants of the world,  and to serve the world we were permitted in the Beginning to exist.  But what one of us is more worthy of immortality than this man Claus,  who so sweetly ministers to the little children?\"    He paused and glanced around the circle, to find every immortal  listening to him eagerly and nodding approval.  Finally the King of the  Wind Demons, who had been whistling softly to himself, cried out:    \"What is your desire, O Ak?\"    \"To bestow upon Claus the Mantle of Immortality!\" said Ak, boldly.    That this demand was wholly unexpected was proved by the immortals  springing to their feet and looking into each other's face with dismay  and then upon Ak with wonder.  For it was a grave matter, this parting  with the Mantle of Immortality.    The Queen of the Water Sprites spoke in her low, clear voice, and the  words sounded like raindrops splashing upon a window-pane.    \"In all the world there is but one Mantle of Immortality,\" she said.    The King of the Sound Fays added:    \"It has existed since the Beginning, and no mortal has ever dared to  claim it.\"    And the Master Mariner of the World arose and stretched his limbs,  saying:    \"Only by the vote of every immortal can it be bestowed upon a mortal.\"    \"I know all this,\" answered Ak, quietly.  \"But the Mantle exists, and  if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5201"],[0,"Don Juan Tenorio (#15)"],[1,"       that it might happen,  que se acelerase el día                 that the day for my vows  de mi profesión, temblé                 might come quickly, I trembled  y sentí del corazón                     and I felt in my heart  acelerarse el vaivén,                   excitement quicken,  teñírseme el semblante                  my face become discolored  de amarilla palidez.                    with yellowish pallor.  ¡Ay de mí...! ¡Pero mi dueña            Ah me!
