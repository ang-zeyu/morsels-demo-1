Such laws are brought about by organizations with a \"purpose\". The  members are anxious to make everyone else conform to their ideas and  habits. Such laws as Sunday laws, liquor laws and the like are examples.  Then, too, every state or nation carries a large list of laws that men  have so long violated and ignored, that they virtually are dead. To  violate these brings no feeling of wrong, but only serves to make men  doubt the evil of violating any law.    It is never easy to get a Legislature to repeal a law. Generally some  organization or committee of people is interested in keeping it alive,  and the members of the Legislature fear losing their votes. Social ideas  are always changing. No laws or customs are eternal. The ordinary man,  and especially the man under the normal, cannot keep up with all the  shifting of a changing world. There is always a fraction of a community  agitating for something new and gradually forcing the Legislature to put  it into law, even against the will of the majority and against the  sentiment of a large class of the community. The organization that wants  something done is always aggressive. The man who wants to prevent it  from being done is seldom unduly active or even alarmed. Many  organizations are eager to get statutes on the books. One seldom hears  of a society or club that is active in getting laws repealed. The  constant change of law, the constant fixing of new values in place of  old ones, is necessary to social life. This means putting new wine into  old bottles, and wine that is much too strong for the bottles. Everybody  can see why some particular law might be violated without a sense of  guilt, but they cannot see how a law they believe in can be violated  without serious obliquity.    Apart from this, there have always been crimes that were not of the  class that implied moral wrong. The acts of the revolutionist who saw,  or thought he saw, visions of something better; the man who is inspired  by the love of his fellow-man and who has no personal ends to gain; the  man who in his devotion to an idea or a person risks his life or liberty  or property or reputation, has never been classed with those who violate  the law for selfish ends. The line of revolutionists, from the beginning  of organized government down to the birth of the United States and even  to the present time, furnishes ample proof of this. And still the  unsuccessful revolutionist meets with the severest penalties. To him  failure generally means death. Men who are fired with zeal for all new  causes are forever running foul of the law. Social organization, like  biological organization, is conservative. All things that live are  imbued with the will to live and they take all means in their power to  go on living. The philosopher can neither quarrel with the idealist who  makes the sacrifice nor the organization that preserves itself while it  can; he only recognizes what is true.    Men have always been obliged to fight to preserve liberty. Constitutions  and laws do not safeguard liberty. It can be preserved only by a  tolerant people, and this means eternal conflict. Emerson said that the  good citizen must not be over-obedient to law. Freedom is always  trampled on in times of stress. The United States suffered serious  encroachments on liberty during the Civil War. During the last war,  these encroachments were greater than any American could have possibly  dreamed; and so far there seems little immediate chance for change.  Still the philosopher does not complain. He sees human passion for what  it is, a great emotion that holds men in its grasp, a feeling that  nothing can stand against. Opposition is destroyed by force, and often  blind, cruel, unreasoning force. Sometimes even worse, this force is  created for selfish ends. There are always those who will use the  strongest and highest emotions of men to serve their private, sordid  ends. Changing social systems, new political ideas, the labor cause, all  movements for religious, social or political change have their zealots;  they are met by the force of convention and conservatism ready to defend  itself, and the clash is inevitable. It is easy to distinguish this sort  of action from the things done by those who are known as criminals.  Their acts are done to serve personal ends. Society may always punish  both, but all men of right ideas will understand that the motive is  different, the equipment and capacity of the men are different, and they  are only in the same class because they each violate the law and are  each responsive to emotions and to feelings that are of sufficient  strength to compel action.          XVI    THE LAW AND THE CRIMINAL      If one were ill with a specific disease and he were sent to a hospital,  every person who touched him, from the time his disease was known until  he was discharged, would use all possible effort to bring him back to  health. Physiology and psychology alike would be used to effect a cure.  Not only would he be given surroundings for regaining health and ample  physical treatment, but he would be helped by appeals in the way of  praise and encouragement, even to the extent of downright falsehood  about his condition, to aid in his recovery.    If such is done of \"disease,\" why not of \"crime\"? Not only is it clear  that crime is a disease whose root is in heredity and environment, but  it is clear that with most men, at least when young, by improving  environment or adding to knowledge and experience, it is curable. Still  with the unfortunate accused of crimes or misdemeanors, from the moment  the attention of the officers is drawn to him until his final  destruction, everything is done to prevent his recovery and to aggravate  and make fatal his disease.    The young boy of the congested districts, who tries to indulge his  normal impulses for play, is driven from every vacant lot; he is  forbidden normal activity by the police; he has no place of his own; he  grows to regard all officers as his enemies instead of his friends; he  is taken into court, where the most well-meaning judge lectures him  about his duties to his parents and threatens him with the dire evils  that the future holds in store for him, unless he reforms. If he is  released, nothing is done by society to give him a better environment  where he can succeed. He is turned out with his old comrades and into  his old life, and is then supposed by strength of will to overcome these  surroundings, a thing which can be done by no person, however strong he  may be.    For the graver things, the boy or man is taken to the police station.  There he is photographed and his name and family record taken down even  before he has had a hearing or a trial. He is handled by officers who  may do the best they can, but who by training and experience and for  lack of time and facilities are not fitted for their important  positions. I say this in spite of the fact that my experience has taught  me that policemen, as a rule, are kindly and human. From the police  station the offender is lodged in jail. Here is huddled together a great  mass of human wreckage, a large part of it being the product of  imperfect heredities acted upon by impossible environments. However  short the time he stays, and however wide his experience, the first  offender learns things he never knew before, and takes another degree in  the life that an evil destiny has prepared for him. In the jail he is  fed much like the animals in the zoo. In many prisons the jailer is  making what money he can by the amount he can save on each prisoner he  feeds above the rate the law allows of twenty-five or fifty cents a day.  In a short time the prisoner's misery and grief turn to bitterness and  hate; hatred of jailer, of officers, of society, of existing things, of  the fate that overshadows his life. There is only one thing that offers  him opportunity and that is a life of crime. He is indicted and  prosecuted. The prosecuting attorney is equipped with money and provided  with ample detectives and assistants to make it impossible for the  prisoner to escape. Everyone believes him guilty from the time of his  arrest. The black marks of his life have been recorded at schools, in  police stations and examining courts. The good marks are not there and  would not be competent evidence if they were. Theoretically the State's  Attorney is as much bound to protect him as to prosecute him, but the  State's Attorney has the psychology that leads to a belief of guilt, and  when he forms that belief his duty follows, which is to land the victim  in prison. It is not only his duty to land him in jail, but the office  of the State's Attorney is usually a stepping-stone to something else,  and he must make a record and be talked about. The public is interested  only in sending bad folks to jail.    No doubt there are very few State's Attorneys who would knowingly  prosecute unless they believed a man guilty of the offense, but it is  easy for a State's Attorney to believe in guilt. Every man's daily life  is largely made up of acts from which a presumption of either guilt or  innocence can be inferred, depending upon the attitude of the one who  draws the inference.    To a State's Attorney or his assistants the case is one that he should  win. All cases should be won. Even though he means to be fair, his  psychology is to win. No lawyer interested in a result can be fair. The  lawyer is an advocate trying to show that his side is right and trying  to win the case. The fact that he represents the State makes no  difference in his psychology. In fact, he always tells the jury that he  represents the State and is as much interested in protecting the  defendant as in protecting society. He does this so that the jury will  give his statements more weight than the statements of the lawyer for  the defense, and this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12058"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#16)"],[1,"regenerate ones of that place will be  virtuous and steady in observing their respective duties. Indeed, in the  country where the sons of Pandu may have taken up their abode during  this thirteenth year of their exile, the people will be contented and  cheerful, pure in conduct and without misery of any kind. Devoted to  gods and guests and the worship of these with their whole soul, they  will be fond of giving away, and filled with great energy, they will all  be observant of eternal virtue. There where king Yudhishthira resides,  the people, eschewing all that is evil, will be desirous of achieving  only what is good. Always observant of sacrifices and pure vows, and  hating untruth in speech, the people of the place where king  Yudhishthira may reside will always be desirous of obtaining what is  good, auspicious and beneficial. There where Yudhishthira resides, the  people will certainly be desirous of achieving what is good, and their  hearts will always incline towards virtue, and their vows being  agreeable they themselves are ever-engaged in the acquisition of  religious merit. O child, that son of Pritha in whom are intelligence  and charity, the highest tranquillity and undoubted forgiveness, modesty  and prosperity, and fame and great energy and a love for all creatures,  is incapable of being found out (now that he hath concealed himself)  even by Brahmanas, let alone ordinary persons. The wise Yudhishthira is  living in close disguise in regions whose characteristics I have  described. Regarding his excellent mode of life, I dare not say anything  more. Reflecting well upon all this, do without loss of time what thou  mayst think to be beneficial, O prince of the Kuru race, if indeed, thou  hast any faith in me.'\"        [21] This is a very difficult sloka. I am not sure that I have      understood it alright. Both Nilakantha and Arjuna Misra are      silent. Instead of depending, however, on my own intelligence, I      have consulted several friends who have read the _Mahabharata_      thoroughly. The grammatical structure is easy. The only      difficulty consists in the second half of the sloka. The      meaning, however, I have given is consistent with the tenor of      Bhishma's advice.        [22] Indicating the unobstructed completion of the sacrifice.      SECTION XXIX    Vaisampayana said, \"Then Saradwata's son, Kripa said, 'What the aged  Bhishma hath said concerning the Pandavas is reasonable, suited to the  occasion, consistent with virtue and profit, agreeable to the ear,  fraught with sound reason, and worthy of him. Listen also to what I  would say on this subject. It behoveth thee to ascertain the track they  have followed and their abode also by means of spies,[23] and to adopt  that policy which may bring about thy welfare. O child, he that is  solicitous of his welfare should not disregard even an ordinary foe.  What shall I say, then, O child, of the Pandavas who are thorough  masters of all weapons in battle. When, therefore, the time cometh for  the reappearance of the high-souled Pandavas, who, having entered the  forest,[24] are now passing their days in close disguise, thou shouldst  ascertain thy strength both in thy own kingdom and in those of other  kings. Without doubt, the return of the Pandavas is at hand. When their  promised term of exile is over, the illustrious and mighty sons of  Pritha, endued with immeasurable prowess, will come hither bursting with  energy. Do thou, therefore, in order to conclude an advantageous treaty  with them, have recourse to sound policy and address thyself to increase  thy forces and improve thy treasury. O child, ascertaining all these,  reckon thou thy own strength in respect of all thy allies weak and  strong.[25] Ascertaining the efficiency, and weakness, and indifference  of thy forces, as also who amongst them are well-affected and who are  disaffected, we should either fight the foe or make treaty with him.  Having recourse to the arts of conciliation, disunion, chastisement,  bribery, presents and fair behaviour, attack thy foes and subdue the  weak by might, and win over thy allies and troops and by soft speeches.  When thou hast (by these means) strengthened thy army and filled thy  treasury, entire success will be thine. When thou hast done all this,  thou wilt be able to fight with powerful enemies that may present  themselves, let alone the sons of Pandu deficient in troops and animals  of their own. By adopting all these expedients according to the customs  of thy order, thou wilt, O foremost of men, attain enduring happiness in  due time!'\"        [23] The word _tirtha_ here means, as Nilakantha rightly      explains spies and not holy spots.        [24] _Satram_ is explained by Nilakantha to mean here 'false      disguise.' I think, however, such an interpretation to be      far-fetched. It evidently means 'forest',--the use of      'pravisteshu' in connection with it almost settles the point.        [25] This sloka is not correctly printed in any of the texts      that I have seen. The reading that I adopt is that the second      word is the participle of the root _budh_ and not the      instrumental of _budhi_; the last word again of the second line      is a compound of _valavatsu_ and _avaleshu_ instead of (as      printed in many books) _valavatswavaleshu_. Any other reading      would certainly be incorrect. I have not consulted the Bombay      text.      SECTION XXX    Vaisampayana said, \"Discomfited before, O monarch, many a time and oft  by Matsya's _Suta_ Kichaka aided by the Matsyas and the Salyas, the  mighty king of the Trigartas, Susarman, who owned innumerable cars,  regarding the opportunity to be a favourable one, then spoke the  following words without losing a moment. And, O monarch, forcibly  vanquished along with his relatives by the mighty Kichaka, king  Susarman, eyeing Karna in askance, spoke these words unto Duryodhana,  'My kingdom hath many a time been forcibly invaded by the king of the  Matsyas. The mighty Kichaka was that king's generalissimo. Crooked and  wrathful and of wicked soul, of prowess famed over all the world, sinful  in deeds and highly cruel, that wretch, however, hath been slain by the  Gandharvas. Kichaka being dead, king Virata, shorn of pride and his  refuge gone, will, I imagine, lose all courage. I think we ought now to  invade that kingdom, if it pleases thee, O sinless one, as also the  illustrious Karna and all the Kauravas. The accident that hath happened  is, I imagine, a favourable one for us. Let us, therefore, repair to  Virata's kingdom abounding in corn. We will appropriate his gems and  other wealth of diverse kinds, and let us go to share with each other as  regards his villages and kingdom. Or, invading his city by force, let us  carry off by thousands his excellent kine of various species. Uniting, O  king, the forces of the Kauravas and the Trigartas, let us lift his  cattle in droves. Or, uniting our forces well, we will check his power  by forcing him to sue for peace. Or, destroying his entire host, we will  bring Matsya under subjection. Having brought him under subjection by  just means, we will live in our kingdom happily, while thy power also  will, without doubt, be enhanced.' Hearing these words of Susarman,  Karna addressed the king, saying, 'Susarman hath spoken well; the  opportunity is favourable and promises to be profitable to us.  Therefore, if it pleases thee, O sinless one, let us, drawing up our  forces in battle array and marshalling them in divisions, speedily set  out. Or, let the expedition be managed as Saradwata's son Kripa, the  preceptor Drona, and the wise and aged grandsire of the Kurus may think.  Consulting with each other, let us, O lord of earth, speedily set out to  attain our end. What business have we with the sons of Pandu, destitute  as they are of wealth, might, and prowess? They have either disappeared  for good or have gone to the abode of _Yama_. We will, O king, repair  without anxiety to Virata's city, and plunder his cattle and other  wealth of diverse kinds.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Accepting these words of Karna, the son of  Surya, king Duryodhana speedily commanded his brother Duhsasana, born  immediately after him and always obedient to his wishes, saying,  'Consulting with the elders, array without delay, our forces. We will  with all the Kauravas go to the appointed place. Let also the mighty  warrior, king Susarman, accompanied by a sufficient force with vehicles  and animals, set out with the Trigartas for the dominions of Matsyas.  And let Susarman proceed first, carefully concealing his intention.  Following in their wake, we will set out the day after in close array,  for the prosperous dominions of king Matsya. Let the Trigartas, however,  suddenly repair to the city of Virata, and coming upon the cowherds,  seize that immense wealth (of kine). We also marching in two divisions,  will seize thousands of excellent kine furnished with auspicious  marks.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Then, O Lord of earth, those warriors, the  Trigartas, accompanied by their infantry of terrible prowess, marched  towards the south-eastern direction, intending to wage hostilities with  Virata from the desire of seizing his kine. And Susarman set out on the  seventh day of the dark fortnight for seizing the kine. And then, O  king, on the eighth day following of the dark fortnight, the Kauravas  also accompanied by all their troops, began to seize the kine by  thousands.\"      SECTION XXXI    Vaisampayana said, \"O mighty king, entering into king Virata's service,  and dwelling in disguise in his excellent city, the high-souled Pandavas  of immeasurable prowess, completed the promised period of non-discovery.  And after Kichaka had been slain, that slayer of hostile heroes, the  mighty king Virata began to rest his hopes on the sons of Kunti.
