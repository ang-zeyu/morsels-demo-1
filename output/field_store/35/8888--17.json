The groan of an overwrought soul  escaped him.    \"I can't do it!\"    He sprang to his feet.    \"I won't do it.\"    A smooth voice from behind him spoke.    \"I think you are quite right, sir--if I may make the remark.\"    Roland had hardly ever been so startled in his life. In the first place,  he was not aware of having uttered his thoughts aloud; in the second, he  had imagined that he was alone in the room. And so, a moment before, he  had been.    But the owner of the voice possessed, among other qualities, the  cat-like faculty of entering a room perfectly noiselessly--a fact which  had won for him, in the course of a long career in the service of the  best families, the flattering position of star witness in a number of  England's raciest divorce-cases.    Mr. Teal, the butler--for it was no less a celebrity who had broken in  on Roland's reverie--was a long, thin man of a somewhat priestly cast of  countenance. He lacked that air of reproving hauteur which many butlers  possess, and it was for this reason that Roland had felt drawn to him  during the black days of his stay at Evenwood Towers. Teal had been  uncommonly nice to him on the whole. He had seemed to Roland, stricken  by interviews with his host and Lady Kimbuck, the only human thing in  the place.    He liked Teal. On the other hand, Teal was certainly taking a liberty.  He could, if he so pleased, tell Teal to go to the deuce. Technically,  he had the right to freeze Teal with a look.    He did neither of these things. He was feeling very lonely and very  forlorn in a strange and depressing world, and Teal's voice and manner  were soothing.    \"Hearing you speak, and seeing nobody else in the room,\" went on the  butler, \"I thought for a moment that you were addressing me.\"    This was not true, and Roland knew it was not true. Instinct told him  that Teal knew that he knew it was not true; but he did not press the  point.    \"What do you mean--you think I am quite right?\" he said. \"You don't know  what I was thinking about.\"    Teal smiled indulgently.    \"On the contrary, sir. A child could have guessed it. You have just  come to the decision--in my opinion a thoroughly sensible one--that your  engagement to her ladyship can not be allowed to go on. You are quite  right, sir. It won't do.\"    Personal magnetism covers a multitude of sins. Roland was perfectly well  aware that he ought not to be standing here chatting over his and Lady  Eva's intimate affairs with a butler; but such was Teal's magnetism that  he was quite unable to do the right thing and tell him to mind his own  business. \"Teal, you forget yourself!\" would have covered the situation.  Roland, however, was physically incapable of saying \"Teal, you forget  yourself!\" The bird knows all the time that he ought not to stand  talking to the snake, but he is incapable of ending the conversation.  Roland was conscious of a momentary wish that he was the sort of man who  could tell butlers that they forgot themselves. But then that sort  of man would never be in this sort of trouble. The \"Teal, you forget  yourself\" type of man would be a first-class shot, a plus golfer, and  would certainly consider himself extremely lucky to be engaged to Lady  Eva.    \"The question is,\" went on Mr. Teal, \"how are we to break it off?\"    Roland felt that, as he had sinned against all the decencies in allowing  the butler to discuss his affairs with him, he might just as well go  the whole hog and allow the discussion to run its course. And it was an  undeniable relief to talk about the infernal thing to some one.    He nodded gloomily, and committed himself. Teal resumed his remarks with  the gusto of a fellow-conspirator.    \"It's not an easy thing to do gracefully, sir, believe me, it isn't.  And it's got to be done gracefully, or not at all. You can't go to her  ladyship and say 'It's all off, and so am I,' and catch the next train  for London. The rupture must be of her ladyship's making. If some  fact, some disgraceful information concerning you were to come to her  ladyship's ears, that would be a simple way out of the difficulty.\"    He eyed Roland meditatively.    \"If, for instance, you had ever been in jail, sir?\"    \"Well, I haven't.\"    \"No offense intended, sir, I'm sure. I merely remembered that you had  made a great deal of money very quickly. My experience of gentlemen who  have made a great deal of money very quickly is that they have generally  done their bit of time. But, of course, if you----. Let me think. Do you  drink, sir?\"    \"No.\"    Mr. Teal sighed. Roland could not help feeling that he was disappointing  the old man a good deal.    \"You do not, I suppose, chance to have a past?\" asked Mr. Teal, not very  hopefully. \"I use the word in its technical sense. A deserted wife? Some  poor creature you have treated shamefully?\"    At the risk of sinking still further in the butler's esteem, Roland was  compelled to answer in the negative.    \"I was afraid not,\" said Mr. Teal, shaking his head. \"Thinking it all  over yesterday, I said to myself, 'I'm afraid he wouldn't have one.' You  don't look like the sort of gentleman who had done much with his time.\"    \"Thinking it over?\"    \"Not on your account, sir,\" explained Mr. Teal. \"On the family's. I  disapproved of this match from the first. A man who has served a family  as long as I have had the honor of serving his lordship's, comes to  entertain a high regard for the family prestige. And, with no offense to  yourself, sir, this would not have done.\"    \"Well, it looks as if it would have to do,\" said Roland, gloomily. \"I  can't see any way out of it.\"    \"I can, sir. My niece at Aldershot.\"    Mr. Teal wagged his head at him with a kind of priestly archness.    \"You can not have forgotten my niece at Aldershot?\"    Roland stared at him dumbly. It was like a line out of a melodrama. He  feared, first for his own, then for the butler's sanity. The latter was  smiling gently, as one who sees light in a difficult situation.    \"I've never been at Aldershot in my life.\"    \"For our purposes you have, sir. But I'm afraid I am puzzling you. Let  me explain. I've got a niece over at Aldershot who isn't much  good. She's not very particular. I am sure she would do it for a  consideration.\"    \"Do what?\"    \"Be your 'Past,' sir. I don't mind telling you that as a 'Past' she's  had some experience; looks the part, too. She's a barmaid, and you would  guess it the first time you saw her. Dyed yellow hair, sir,\" he went on  with enthusiasm, \"done all frizzy. Just the sort of young person that a  young gentleman like yourself would have had a 'past' with. You couldn't  find a better if you tried for a twelvemonth.\"    \"But, I say----!\"    \"I suppose a hundred wouldn't hurt you?\"    \"Well, no, I suppose not, but----\"    \"Then put the whole thing in my hands, sir. I'll ask leave off to-morrow  and pop over and see her. I'll arrange for her to come here the day  after to see you. Leave it all to me. To-night you must write the  letters.\"    \"Letters?\"    \"Naturally, there would be letters, sir. It is an inseparable feature of  these cases.\"    \"Do you mean that I have got to write to her? But I shouldn't know what  to say. I've never seen her.\"    \"That will be quite all right, sir, if you place yourself in my hands. I  will come to your room after everybody's gone to bed, and help you write  those letters. You have some note-paper with your own address on it?  Then it will all be perfectly simple.\"    When, some hours later, he read over the ten or twelve exceedingly  passionate epistles which, with the butler's assistance, he had  succeeded in writing to Miss Maud Chilvers, Roland came to the  conclusion that there must have been a time when Mr. Teal was a good  deal less respectable than he appeared to be at present. Byronic was  the only adjective applicable to his collaborator's style of amatory  composition. In every letter there were passages against which Roland  had felt compelled to make a modest protest.    \"'A thousand kisses on your lovely rosebud of a mouth.' Don't you think  that is a little too warmly colored? And 'I am languishing for the  pressure of your ivory arms about my neck and the sweep of your silken  hair against my cheek!' What I mean is--well, what about it, you know?\"    \"The phrases,\" said Mr. Teal, not without a touch of displeasure, \"to  which you take exception, are taken bodily from correspondence (which I  happened to have the advantage of perusing) addressed by the late Lord  Evenwood to Animalcula, Queen of the High Wire at Astley's Circus. His  lordship, I may add, was considered an authority in these matters.\"    Roland criticized no more. He handed over the letters, which, at Mr.  Teal's direction, he had headed with various dates covering roughly a  period of about two months antecedent to his arrival at the Towers.    \"That,\" Mr. Teal explained, \"will make your conduct definitely  unpardonable. With this woman's kisses hot upon your lips,\"--Mr. Teal  was still slightly aglow with the fire of inspiration--\"you have the  effrontery to come here and offer yourself to her ladyship.\"    With Roland's timid suggestion that it was perhaps a mistake to overdo  the atmosphere, the butler found himself unable to agree.    \"You can't make yourself out too bad. If you don't pitch it hot and  strong, her ladyship might quite likely forgive you. Then where would  you be?\"    Miss Maud Chilvers, of Aldershot, burst into Roland's life like one  of the shells of her native heath two days later at about five in the  afternoon.    It was an entrance of which any stage-manager might have been proud  of having arranged. The lighting, the grouping, the lead-up--all were  perfect. The family had just finished tea in the long drawing-room.  Lady Kimbuck was crocheting, Lord Evenwood dozing, Lady Eva reading, and  Roland thinking. A peaceful scene.
