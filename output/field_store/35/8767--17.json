[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53526"],[0,"Cardinal Wolsey (#15)"],[1,"told the Spanish ambassador that, if his master were in  earnest, he should order his troops to advance against Rome, and should  command the cardinals to elect his nominee; he offered to provide  100,000 ducats to cover the expenses of such action. When it came to the  point Wolsey was a very practical politician, and was under no illusions  about the fair pretences of free choice which surrounded a papal  election. He treated it as a matter to be settled by pressure from  outside, according to the will of the strongest. There is something  revoltingly cynical in this proposal. No doubt many men thought like  Wolsey, but no one else would have had the boldness to speak out.  Wolsey's outspokenness was of no avail at the time, but it bore fruits  afterwards. He taught Henry VIII. to conceive the possibility of a short  way of dealing with refractory popes. He confirmed his willing pupil in  the belief that all things may be achieved by the resolute will of one  who rises above prejudice and faces the world as it is. When he fell he  must have recognised that it was himself who trained the arm which smote  him.    In spite of Wolsey's advice Charles did not allow Spanish influence to  be unduly felt in the proceedings of the conclave. Rarely had the  cardinals been more undecided, and when they went into the conclave on  27th December, it was said that every one of them was a candidate for  the Papacy. The first point was to exclude Cardinal Medici, and it could  be plausibly urged that it was dangerous to elect two successive popes  from the same family. Medici's opponents succeeded in making his  election impossible, but could not agree upon a candidate of their own;  while Medici tried to bring about the election of some one who would be  favourable to the Emperor. At last in weariness the cardinals turned  their thoughts to some one who was not present. Wolsey was proposed, and  received seven votes; but Medici was waiting his time, and put forward  Cardinal Adrian of Utrecht, who had been Charles's tutor, and was then  governing Spain in his master's name. Both parties agreed on him,  chiefly because he was personally unknown to any of the cardinals, had  given no offence, was well advanced in years, and was reckoned to be of  a quiet disposition, so that every one had hopes of guiding his  counsels. It was clear that the imperialists were strongest in the  conclave, and of all the imperialist candidates Adrian was the least  offensive to the French. One thing is quite clear, that Charles V. had  not the least intention of helping Wolsey.    Wolsey probably knew this well enough, and was not disappointed. He bore  the Emperor no ill-will for his lukewarmness; indeed he had no ground  for expecting anything else. Wolsey's aim was not the same as that of  Charles, and Charles had had sufficient opportunity to discover the  difference between them. Probably Wolsey saw that the alliance between  England and the Emperor would not be of long duration, as there was no  real identity of interests. Henry VIII. was dazzled for a moment with  the prospect of asserting the English claims on France; he was glad to  find himself at one with his queen, who was overjoyed at the prospect of  a family alliance with her own beloved land of Spain. The English nobles  rejoiced at an opportunity to display their prowess, and hoped in time  of war to recover the influence and position of which they had been  deprived by an upstart priest. The sentiment of hostility to France was  still strong amongst the English people, and the allurements of a  spirited foreign policy were many. But as a matter of fact England was  ill prepared for war; and though the people might throw up their caps at  first, they would not long consent to pay for a war which brought them  no profits. And the profits were not likely to be great, for Charles had  no wish to see England's importance increased. He desired only English  help to achieve his own purposes, and was no more trustworthy as an ally  than had been his grandfather Ferdinand.    However, war had been agreed upon, and all that Wolsey could do was to  try and put off its declaration until he had secured sufficient  assurance that English money was not to be spent to no purpose. Charles  V., who was in sore straits for money, asked for a loan from England, to  which Wolsey answered that England could not declare war till the loan  was repaid. He insisted that no declaration of war should be made till  the Emperor had fulfilled his promise to pay a visit to England, a  promise which Charles's want of money rendered him unable for some time  to keep.    But however much Wolsey might try to put off the declaration of war, it  was inevitable. Francis could not be expected, for all Wolsey's fine  promises, to continue his payments for Tournai to so doubtful an ally as  Henry, nor could he resist from crippling England as far as he could.  The Duke of Albany went back to Scotland; and in the beginning of May  Francis ordered the seizure of goods lying at Bordeaux for shipment to  England. This led to retaliation on the part of England, and war was  declared against France on 28th May 1522.    This coincided with the visit of Charles V. to London, where he was  magnificently entertained for a month, while the treaty of alliance was  being finally brought into shape by Wolsey and Gattinara. Wolsey  contented himself with providing that the alliance did not go further  than had been agreed at Bruges, and that England's interests were  secured by an undertaking from Charles that he would pay the loss which  Henry VIII. sustained by the withdrawal of the French instalments for  Tournai. When the treaty was signed it was Wolsey who, as papal legate,  submitted both princes to ecclesiastical censures in case of a breach of  its provisions. Moreover, Charles granted Wolsey a pension of 9000  crowns in compensation for his loss from Tournai, and renewed his empty  promise of raising him to the Papacy.    It was one thing to declare war and another to carry it on with good  effect. England, in spite of all the delays which Wolsey had contrived  to interpose, was still unprepared. It was late in the autumn before  forces could be put in the field, and the troops of Charles V. were too  few for a joint undertaking of any importance. The allies contented  themselves with invading Picardy, where they committed useless  atrocities, burning houses, devastating the country, and working all the  mischief that they could. They did not advance into the centre of  France, and no army met them in the field; in the middle of October they  retired ingloriously. It is hard to discover the purpose of such an  expedition. The damage done was not enough to weaken France materially,  and such a display of barbarity was ill suited to win the French people  to favour Henry VIII.'s claim to be their rightful lord. If Francis I.  had been unpopular before, he was now raised to the position of a  national leader whose help was necessary for the protection of his  subjects.    The futile result of this expedition caused mutual recriminations  between the new allies. The imperialists complained that the English had  come too late; the English answered that they had not been properly  supported. There were no signs of mutual confidence; and the two  ministers, Wolsey and Gattinara, were avowed enemies, and did not  conceal their hostility. The alliance with the Emperor did not show  signs of prospering from the beginning.    The proceedings of the Earl of Surrey and the direction of the campaign  were not Wolsey's concern. He was employed nearer home, in keeping a  watchful eye on Scotland, which threatened to be a hindrance to Henry  VIII.'s great undertakings abroad. The return of the Duke of Albany in  December 1521 was a direct threat of war. Albany was nominally regent,  but had found his office troublesome, and had preferred to spend the  last five years in the gaieties of the French Court rather than among  the rugged nobles of Scotland. They were years when France was at peace  with England and had little interest in Scottish affairs; so Queen  Margaret might quarrel with her husband at leisure, while the Scottish  lords distributed themselves between the two parties as suited them  best. But when war between France and England was approaching, the Duke  of Albany was sent back by Francis I. to his post as agent for France in  Scottish affairs. Queen Margaret welcomed him with joy, hoping that he  would further her plan of gaining a divorce from the Earl of Angus.  Before this union of forces the English party in Scotland was powerless.  It was in vain that Henry VIII. tried by menaces to influence either his  sister or the Scottish lords. As soon as the English forces sailed for  France Albany prepared to invade England.    It was lucky for Henry VIII. that he was well served on the Borders by  Lord Dacre of Naworth, who managed to show the Scots the measure of  Albany's incapacity. Dacre began negotiations with Albany, to save time;  and when, in September, the Scottish forces passed the Border, Albany  was willing to make a truce. As a matter of fact, England was totally  unprepared to repel an invasion, and Albany might have dictated his own  terms. But Dacre, in Carlisle, which he could not defend, maintained his  courage, and showed no signs of fear. He managed to blind Albany to the  real state of affairs, and kept him from approaching to the crumbling  walls of Carlisle. He advanced to the Debatable Land to meet him, and  \"with a high voice\" demanded the reason of his coming; and the parley  thus begun ended in the conclusion of a month's truce. Wolsey was  overjoyed at this result, but yet found it necessary to intercede with  the king for Dacre's pardon, as he had no authority to make terms with  the enemy; and Dacre was not only forgiven, but thanked.

I happened to be at Bloomington. And while the idiots on the  platform were drivelling, the people kept calling for Lincoln. I had  never heard of him then. I've never forgot him since. He came ambling  out of the back of the hall, a lanky, gawky looking man, ridiculously  ugly, sir. But the moment he opened his mouth he had us spellbound. The  language which your low-down lawyer used was that of a God-sent prophet,  sir. He had those Illinois bumpkins all worked up,--the women crying,  and some of the men, too. And mad! Good Lord, they were mad--'We will  say to the Southern disunionists,' he cried,--'we will say to the  Southern disunionists, we won't go out of the Union, and you shan't.'\"    There was a silence when the Judge finished. But presently Mr.  Carvel took a match. And he stood over the Judge in his favorite  attitude,--with his feet apart,--as he lighted another cigar.    \"I reckon we're going to have war, Silas,\" said he, slowly; \"but don't  you think that your Mr. Lincoln scares me into that belief. I don't  count his bluster worth a cent. No sirree! It's this youngster who comes  out here from Boston and buys a nigger with all the money he's got in  the world. And if he's an impetuous young fool; I'm no judge of men.\"    \"Appleton Brice wasn't precisely impetuous,\" remarked Mr. Whipple. And  he smiled a little bitterly, as though the word had stirred a memory.    \"I like that young fellow,\" Mr. Carvel continued. \"It seems to be a kind  of fatality with me to get along with Yankees. I reckon there's a screw  loose somewhere, but Brice acted the man all the way through. He goa  a fall out of you, Silas, in your room, after the show. Where are you  going, Jinny?\"    Virginia had risen, and she was standing very erects with a flush on her  face, waiting for her father to finish.    \"To see Anne Brinsmade,\" she said. \"Good-by, Uncle Silas.\"    She had called him so from childhood. Hers was the one voice that seemed  to soften him--it never failed. He turned to her now with a movement  that was almost gentle. \"Virginia, I should like you to know my young  Yankee,\" said he.    \"Thank you, Uncle Silas,\" said the girl, with dignity, \"but I scarcely  think that he would care to know me. He feels so strongly.\"    \"He feels no stronger than I do,\" replied the Judge.    \"You have gotten used to me in eighteen years, and besides,\" she  flashed, \"you never spent all the money you had in the world for a  principle.\"    Mr. Whipple smiled as she went out of the door.    \"I have spent pretty near all,\" he said. But more to himself than to the  Colonel.    That evening, some young people came in to tea, two of the four big  Catherwood boys, Anne Brinsmade and her brother Jack, Puss Russell and  Bert, and Eugenie Renault. But Virginia lost her temper. In an evil  moment Puss Russell started the subject of the young Yankee who had  deprived her of Hester. Puss was ably seconded by Jack Brinsmade, whose  reputation as a tormentor extended far back into his boyhood. In vain;  did Anne, the peacemaker, try to quench him, while the big Catherwoods  and Bert Russell laughed incessantly. No wonder that Virginia was angry.  She would not speak to Puss as that young lady bade her good night. And  the Colonel, coming home from an evening with Mr. Brinsmade, found his  daughter in an armchair, staring into the sitting-room fire. There was  no other light in the room Her chin was in her hand, and her lips were  pursed.    \"Heigho!\" said the Colonel, \"what's the trouble now?\"    \"Nothing,\" said Virginia.    \"Come,\" he insisted, \"what have they been doing to my girl?\"    \"Pa!\"    \"Yes, honey.\"    \"I don't want to go to balls all my life. I want to go to  boarding-school, and learn something. Emily is going to Monticello after  Christmas. Pa, will you let me?\"    Mr. Carvel winced. He put an arm around her. He, thought of his lonely  widowerhood, of her whose place Virginia had taken.    \"And what shall I do?\" he said, trying to smile.    \"It will only be for a little while. And Monticello isn't very far, Pa.\"    \"Well, well, there is plenty of time to think it over between now and  January,\" he said. \"And now I have a little favor to ask of you, honey.\"    \"Yes?\" she said.    The Colonel took the other armchair, stretched his feet toward the  blaze, and stroked his goatee. He glanced covertly at his daughter's  profile. Twice he cleared hip throat.    \"Jinny?\"    \"Yes, Pa\" (without turning her head).    \"Jinny, I was going to speak of this young. Brice. He's a stranger here,  and he comes of a good family, and--and I like him.\"    \"And you wish me to invite him to my party,\" finished Virginia.    The Colonel started. \"I reckon you guessed it,\" he said.    Virginia remained immovable. She did not answer at once. Then she said:    \"Do you think, in bidding against me, that he behaved, like a  gentleman?\"    The Colonel blundered.    \"Lord, Virginia,\" he said, \"I thought you told the judge this afternoon  teat it was done out of principle.\"    Virginia ignored this. But she bit her lip    \"He is like all Yankees, without one bit of consideration for a woman.  He knew I wanted Hester.\"    \"What makes you imagine that he thought of you at all, my dear?\" asked  her father, mildly, \"He does not know you.\"    This time the Colonel scored certainly. The firelight saved Virginia.    \"He overheard our conversation,\" she answered.    \"I reckon that he wasn't worrying much about us. And besides, he was  trying to save Hester from Jennings.\"    \"I thought that you said that it was to be my party, Pa,\" said Virginia,  irrelevantly.    The Colonel looked thoughtful, then he began to laugh.    \"Haven't we enough Black Republican friends?\" she asked.    \"So you won't have him?\" said the Colonel.    \"I didn't say that I wouldn't have him,\" she answered.    The Colonel rose, and brushed the ashes from his goat.    \"By Gum!\" he said. \"Women beat me.\"          CHAPTER X. THE LITTLE HOUSE    When Stephen attempted to thank Judge Whipple for going on Hester's  bond, he merely said, \"Tut, tut.\"    The Judge rose at six, so his man Shadrach told Stephen. He had his  breakfast at the Planters' House at seven, read the Missouri Democrat,  and returned by eight. Sometimes he would say good morning to Stephen  and Richter, and sometimes he would not. Mr. Whipple was out a great  part of the day, and he had many visitors. He was a very busy man. Like  a great specialist (which he was), he would see only one person at a  time. And Stephen soon discovered that his employer did not discriminate  between age or sex, or importance, or condition of servitude. In short,  Stephen's opinion of Judge Whipple altered very materially before the  end of that first week. He saw poor women and disconsolate men go into  the private room ahead of rich citizens, who seemed content to wait  their turn on the hard wooden chairs against the wall of the main  office. There was one incident in particular, when a well-dressed  gentleman of middle age paced impatiently for two mortal hours after  Shadrach had taken his card into the sanctum. When at last he had been  admitted, Mr. Richter whispered to Stephen his name. It was that of a  big railroad man from the East. The transom let out the true state of  affairs.    \"See here, Callender,\" the Judge was heard to say, \"you fellows don't  like me, and you wouldn't come here unless you had to. But when your  road gets in a tight place, you turn up and expect to walk in ahead of  my friends. No, sir, if you want to see me, you've got to wait.\"    Mr. Callender made some inaudible reply, \"Money!\" roared the Judge,  \"take your money to Stetson, and see if you win your case.\"    Mr. Richter smiled at Stephen, as if in sheer happiness at this  vindication of an employer who had never seemed to him to need a  defence.    Stephen was greatly drawn toward this young German with the great scar  on his pleasant face. And he was itching to know about that scar.  Every day, after coming in from dinner, Richter lighted a great brown  meerschaum, and read the St. Louis 'Anzeiger' and the 'Westliche Post'.  Often he sang quietly to himself:              \"Deutschlands Sohne            Laut ertone            Euer Vaterlandgesang.            Vaterland! Du Land des Ruhmes,            Weih' zu deines Heiligthumes            Hutern, uns and unser Schwert.\"    There were other songs, too. And some wonderful quality in the German's  voice gave you a thrill when you heard them, albeit you could not  understand the words. Richter never guessed how Stephen, with his eyes  on his book, used to drink in those airs. And presently he found out  that they were inspired.    The day that the railroad man called, and after he and the Judge had  gone out together, the ice was broken.    \"You Americans from the North are a queer people, Mr. Brice,\" remarked  Mr. Richter, as he put on his coat. \"You do not show your feelings. You  are ashamed. The Judge, at first I could not comprehend him--he would  scold and scold. But one day I see that his heart is warm, and since  then I love him. Have you ever eaten a German dinner, Mr. Brice? No?  Then you must come with me, now.\"    It was raining, the streets ankle-deep in mud, and the beer-garden by  the side of the restaurant to which they went was dreary and bedraggled.  But inside the place was warm and cheerful. Inside, to all intents and  purposes, it was Germany. A most genial host crossed the room to give  Mr. Richter a welcome that any man might have envied. He was introduced  to Stephen.    \"We were all 'Streber' together, in Germany,\" said Richter.    \"You were all what?\" asked Stephen, interested.    \"Strivers, you might call it in English. In the Vaterland those who  seek for higher and better things--for liberty, and to be rid of  oppression--are so called. That is why we fought in '48 and lost. And  that is why we came here, to the Republic. "]]]
