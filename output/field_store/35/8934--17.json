Many a time and oft I heard of thee, but never did I hope to set  eyes upon thee.  And thou art indeed the famous Little John!\"  And the  Cook seemed lost in amazement, and looked upon his companion with open  eyes.    \"I am Little John, indeed, and I will bring to Robin Hood this day a  right stout fellow to join his merry band. But ere we go, good friend,  it seemeth to me to be a vast pity that, as we have had so much of the  Sheriff's food, we should not also carry off some of his silver plate to  Robin Hood, as a present from his worship.\"    \"Ay, marry is it,\" said the Cook.  And so they began hunting about, and  took as much silver as they could lay hands upon, clapping it into a  bag, and when they had filled the sack they set forth to Sherwood  Forest.    Plunging into the woods, they came at last to the greenwood tree, where  they found Robin Hood and threescore of his merry men lying upon the  fresh green grass.  When Robin and his men saw who it was that came,  they leaped to their feet.  \"Now welcome!\" cried Robin Hood.  \"Now  welcome, Little John!  For long hath it been since we have heard from  thee, though we all knew that thou hadst joined the Sheriff's service.  And how hast thou fared all these long days?\"    \"Right merrily have I lived at the Lord Sheriff's,\" answered Little  John, \"and I have come straight thence.  See, good master! I have  brought thee his cook, and even his silver plate.\" Thereupon he told  Robin Hood and his merry men that were there, all that had befallen him  since he had left them to go to the Fair at Nottingham Town.  Then all  shouted with laughter, except Robin Hood; but he looked grave.    \"Nay, Little John,\" said he, \"thou art a brave blade and a trusty  fellow. I am glad thou hast brought thyself back to us, and with such a  good companion as the Cook, whom we all welcome to Sherwood.  But I like  not so well that thou hast stolen the Sheriff's plate like some paltry  thief. The Sheriff hath been punished by us, and hath lost three hundred  pounds, even as he sought to despoil another; but he hath done nought  that we should steal his household plate from him.\"    Though Little John was vexed with this, he strove to pass it off with a  jest.  \"Nay, good master,\" quoth he, \"if thou thinkest the Sheriff gave  us not the plate, I will fetch him, that he may tell us with his own  lips he giveth it all to us.\" So saying he leaped to his feet, and was  gone before Robin could call him back.    Little John ran for full five miles till he came to where the Sheriff of  Nottingham and a gay company were hunting near the forest. When Little  John came to the Sheriff he doffed his cap and bent his knee. \"God save  thee, good master,\" quoth he.    \"Why, Reynold Greenleaf!\" cried the Sheriff, \"whence comest thou and  where hast thou been?\"    \"I have been in the forest,\" answered Little John, speaking amazedly,  \"and there I saw a sight such as ne'er before man's eyes beheld! Yonder  I saw a young hart all in green from top to toe, and about him was a  herd of threescore deer, and they, too, were all of green from head to  foot. Yet I dared not shoot, good master, for fear lest they should slay  me.\"    \"Why, how now, Reynold Greenleaf,\" cried the Sheriff, \"art thou dreaming  or art thou mad, that thou dost bring me such, a tale?\"    \"Nay, I am not dreaming nor am I mad,\" said Little John, \"and if thou  wilt come with me, I will show thee this fair sight, for I have seen it  with mine own eyes.  But thou must come alone, good master, lest the  others frighten them and they get away.\"    So the party all rode forward, and Little John led them downward into  the forest.    \"Now, good master,\" quoth he at last, \"we are nigh where I saw this  herd.\"    Then the Sheriff descended from his horse and bade them wait for him  until he should return; and Little John led him forward through a close  copse until suddenly they came to a great open glade, at the end of  which Robin Hood sat beneath the shade of the great oak tree, with his  merry men all about him. \"See, good Master Sheriff,\" quoth Little John,  \"yonder is the hart of which I spake to thee.\"    At this the Sheriff turned to Little John and said bitterly, \"Long ago I  thought I remembered thy face, but now I know thee. Woe betide thee,  Little John, for thou hast betrayed me this day.\"    In the meantime Robin Hood had come to them.  \"Now welcome, Master  Sheriff,\" said he.  \"Hast thou come today to take another feast with  me?\"    \"Nay, Heaven forbid!\" said the Sheriff in tones of deep earnest. \"I care  for no feast and have no hunger today.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" quoth Robin, \"if thou hast no hunger, maybe thou hast  thirst, and well I know thou wilt take a cup of sack with me. But I am  grieved that thou wilt not feast with me, for thou couldst have victuals  to thy liking, for there stands thy Cook.\"    Then he led the Sheriff, willy-nilly, to the seat he knew so well  beneath the greenwood tree.    \"Ho, lads!\" cried Robin, \"fill our good friend the Sheriff a right  brimming cup of sack and fetch it hither, for he is faint and weary.\"    Then one of the band brought the Sheriff a cup of sack, bowing low as he  handed it to him; but the Sheriff could not touch the wine, for he saw  it served in one of his own silver flagons, on one of his own silver  plates.    \"How now,\" quoth Robin, \"dost thou not like our new silver service? We  have gotten a bag of it this day.\"  So saying, he held up the sack of  silver that Little John and the Cook had brought with them.    Then the Sheriff's heart was bitter within him; but, not daring to say  anything, he only gazed upon the ground. Robin looked keenly at him for  a time before he spoke again. Then said he, \"Now, Master Sheriff, the  last time thou camest to Sherwood Forest thou didst come seeking to  despoil a poor spendthrift, and thou wert despoiled thine own self; but  now thou comest seeking to do no harm, nor do I know that thou hast  despoiled any man. I take my tithes from fat priests and lordly squires,  to help those that they despoil and to raise up those that they bow  down; but I know not that thou hast tenants of thine own whom thou hast  wronged in any way.  Therefore, take thou thine own again, nor will I  dispossess thee today of so much as one farthing. Come with me, and I  will lead thee from the forest back to thine own party again.\"    Then, slinging the bag upon his shoulder, he turned away, the Sheriff  following him, all too perplexed in mind to speak. So they went forward  until they came to within a furlong of the spot where the Sheriff's  companions were waiting for him. Then Robin Hood gave the sack of silver  back to the Sheriff. \"Take thou thine own again,\" he said, \"and hearken  to me, good Sheriff, take thou a piece of advice with it. Try thy  servants well ere thou dost engage them again so readily.\" Then,  turning, he left the other standing bewildered, with the sack in his  hands.    The company that waited for the Sheriff were all amazed to see him come  out of the forest bearing a heavy sack upon his shoulders; but though  they questioned him, he answered never a word, acting like one who walks  in a dream.  Without a word, he placed the bag across his nag's back and  then, mounting, rode away, all following him; but all the time there was  a great turmoil of thoughts within his head, tumbling one over the  other. And thus ends the merry tale of Little John and how he entered  the Sheriff's service.          Little John and the Tanner of Blyth    ONE FINE DAY, not long after Little John had left abiding with the  Sheriff and had come back, with his worship's cook, to the merry  greenwood, as has just been told, Robin Hood and a few chosen fellows of  his band lay upon the soft sward beneath the greenwood tree where they  dwelled. The day was warm and sultry, so that while most of the band  were scattered through the forest upon this mission and upon that, these  few stout fellows lay lazily beneath the shade of the tree, in the soft  afternoon, passing jests among themselves and telling merry stories,  with laughter and mirth.    All the air was laden with the bitter fragrance of the May, and all the  bosky shades of the woodlands beyond rang with the sweet song of birds--  the throstle cock, the cuckoo, and the wood pigeon--and with the song of  birds mingled the cool sound of the gurgling brook that leaped out of  the forest shades, and ran fretting amid its rough, gray stones across  the sunlit open glade before the trysting tree. And a fair sight was  that halfscore of tall, stout yeomen, all clad in Lincoln green, lying  beneath the broad-spreading branches of the great oak tree, amid the  quivering leaves of which the sunlight shivered and fell in dancing  patches upon the grass.    Suddenly Robin Hood smote his knee.    \"By Saint Dunstan,\" quoth he, \"I had nigh forgot that quarter-day cometh  on apace, and yet no cloth of Lincoln green in all our store. It must be  looked to, and that in quick season.  Come, busk thee, Little John!  Stir those lazy bones of thine, for thou must get thee straightway to  our good gossip, the draper Hugh Longshanks of Ancaster.  Bid him send  us straightway twentyscore yards of fair cloth of Lincoln green; and  mayhap the journey may take some of the fat from off thy bones, that  thou hast gotten from lazy living at our dear Sheriff's.\"    \"Nay,\" muttered Little John (for he had heard so much upon this score  that he was sore upon the point), \"nay, truly, mayhap I have more flesh  upon my joints than I once had, yet, flesh or no flesh, I doubt not that  I could still hold my place and footing upon a narrow bridge against  e'er a yeoman in Sherwood, or Nottinghamshire, for the matter of that,  even though he had no more fat about his bones than thou hast, good  master.\"    At this reply a great shout of laughter "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#16)"],[1,"found one of the paths made by them in  their passage to the river; it ran nearly at right angles to my course;  but turning my horse's head in the direction it indicated, his freer  gait and erected ears assured me that I was right.    But in the meantime my ride had been by no means a solitary one.  The whole face of the country was dotted far and wide with countless  hundreds of buffalo. They trooped along in files and columns, bulls  cows, and calves, on the green faces of the declivities in front. They  scrambled away over the hills to the right and left; and far off, the  pale blue swells in the extreme distance were dotted with innumerable  specks. Sometimes I surprised shaggy old bulls grazing alone, or  sleeping behind the ridges I ascended. They would leap up at my  approach, stare stupidly at me through their tangled manes, and then  gallop heavily away. The antelope were very numerous; and as they are  always bold when in the neighborhood of buffalo, they would approach  quite near to look at me, gazing intently with their great round eyes,  then suddenly leap aside, and stretch lightly away over the prairie, as  swiftly as a racehorse. Squalid, ruffianlike wolves sneaked through the  hollows and sandy ravines. Several times I passed through villages of  prairie dogs, who sat, each at the mouth of his burrow, holding his paws  before him in a supplicating attitude, and yelping away most vehemently,  energetically whisking his little tail with every squeaking cry he  uttered. Prairie dogs are not fastidious in their choice of companions;  various long, checkered snakes were sunning themselves in the midst of  the village, and demure little gray owls, with a large white ring around  each eye, were perched side by side with the rightful inhabitants. The  prairie teemed with life. Again and again I looked toward the crowded  hillsides, and was sure I saw horsemen; and riding near, with a mixture  of hope and dread, for Indians were abroad, I found them transformed  into a group of buffalo. There was nothing in human shape amid all this  vast congregation of brute forms.    When I turned down the buffalo path, the prairie seemed changed; only  a wolf or two glided past at intervals, like conscious felons, never  looking to the right or left. Being now free from anxiety, I was at  leisure to observe minutely the objects around me; and here, for the  first time, I noticed insects wholly different from any of the varieties  found farther to the eastward. Gaudy butterflies fluttered about my  horse's head; strangely formed beetles, glittering with metallic luster,  were crawling upon plants that I had never seen before; multitudes of  lizards, too, were darting like lightning over the sand.    I had run to a great distance from the river. It cost me a long ride  on the buffalo path before I saw from the ridge of a sand-hill the pale  surface of the Platte glistening in the midst of its desert valleys, and  the faint outline of the hills beyond waving along the sky. From where  I stood, not a tree nor a bush nor a living thing was visible throughout  the whole extent of the sun-scorched landscape. In half an hour I came  upon the trail, not far from the river; and seeing that the party had  not yet passed, I turned eastward to meet them, old Pontiac's long  swinging trot again assuring me that I was right in doing so. Having  been slightly ill on leaving camp in the morning six or seven hours of  rough riding had fatigued me extremely. I soon stopped, therefore; flung  my saddle on the ground, and with my head resting on it, and my horse's  trail-rope tied loosely to my arm, lay waiting the arrival of the  party, speculating meanwhile on the extent of the injuries Pontiac had  received. At length the white wagon coverings rose from the verge of the  plain. By a singular coincidence, almost at the same moment two horsemen  appeared coming down from the hills. They were Shaw and Henry, who had  searched for me a while in the morning, but well knowing the futility of  the attempt in such a broken country, had placed themselves on the top  of the highest hill they could find, and picketing their horses near  them, as a signal to me, had laid down and fallen asleep. The stray  cattle had been recovered, as the emigrants told us, about noon. Before  sunset, we pushed forward eight miles farther.      JUNE 7, 1846.--Four men are missing; R., Sorel and two emigrants.  They set out this morning after buffalo, and have not yet made their  appearance; whether killed or lost, we cannot tell.      I find the above in my notebook, and well remember the council held on  the occasion. Our fire was the scene of it; or the palpable superiority  of Henry Chatillon's experience and skill made him the resort of the  whole camp upon every question of difficulty. He was molding bullets  at the fire, when the captain drew near, with a perturbed and care-worn  expression of countenance, faithfully reflected on the heavy features  of Jack, who followed close behind. Then emigrants came straggling from  their wagons toward the common center; various suggestions were made to  account for the absence of the four men, and one or two of the emigrants  declared that when out after the cattle they had seen Indians dogging  them, and crawling like wolves along the ridges of the hills. At this  time the captain slowly shook his head with double gravity, and solemnly  remarked:    \"It's a serious thing to be traveling through this cursed wilderness\";  an opinion in which Jack immediately expressed a thorough coincidence.  Henry would not commit himself by declaring any positive opinion.    \"Maybe he only follow the buffalo too far; maybe Indian kill him; maybe  he got lost; I cannot tell!\"    With this the auditors were obliged to rest content; the emigrants, not  in the least alarmed, though curious to know what had become of their  comrades, walked back to their wagons and the captain betook himself  pensively to his tent. Shaw and I followed his example.    \"It will be a bad thing for our plans,\" said he as we entered, \"if these  fellows don't get back safe. The captain is as helpless on the prairie  as a child. We shall have to take him and his brother in tow; they will  hang on us like lead.\"    \"The prairie is a strange place,\" said I. \"A month ago I should have  thought it rather a startling affair to have an acquaintance ride out in  the morning and lose his scalp before night, but here it seems the most  natural thing in the world; not that I believe that R. has lost his  yet.\"    If a man is constitutionally liable to nervous apprehensions, a tour on  the distant prairies would prove the best prescription; for though when  in the neighborhood of the Rocky Mountains he may at times find himself  placed in circumstances of some danger, I believe that few ever breathe  that reckless atmosphere without becoming almost indifferent to any evil  chance that may befall themselves or their friends.    Shaw had a propensity for luxurious indulgence. He spread his blanket  with the utmost accuracy on the ground, picked up the sticks and stones  that he thought might interfere with his comfort, adjusted his saddle to  serve as a pillow, and composed himself for his night's rest. I had the  first guard that evening; so, taking my rifle, I went out of the tent.  It was perfectly dark. A brisk wind blew down from the hills, and  the sparks from the fire were streaming over the prairie. One of the  emigrants, named Morton, was my companion; and laying our rifles on the  grass, we sat down together by the fire. Morton was a Kentuckian, an  athletic fellow, with a fine intelligent face, and in his manners and  conversation he showed the essential characteristics of a gentleman.  Our conversation turned on the pioneers of his gallant native State. The  three hours of our watch dragged away at last, and we went to call up  the relief.    R.'s guard succeeded mine. He was absent; but the captain, anxious lest  the camp should be left defenseless, had volunteered to stand in his  place; so I went to wake him up. There was no occasion for it, for the  captain had been awake since nightfall. A fire was blazing outside of  the tent, and by the light which struck through the canvas, I saw him  and Jack lying on their backs, with their eyes wide open. The captain  responded instantly to my call; he jumped up, seized the double-barreled  rifle, and came out of the tent with an air of solemn determination, as  if about to devote himself to the safety of the party. I went and lay  down, not doubting that for the next three hours our slumbers would be  guarded with sufficient vigilance.        CHAPTER VIII    TAKING FRENCH LEAVE      On the 8th of June, at eleven o'clock, we reached the South Fork of the  Platte, at the usual fording place. For league upon league the desert  uniformity of the prospect was almost unbroken; the hills were dotted  with little tufts of shriveled grass, but betwixt these the white sand  was glaring in the sun; and the channel of the river, almost on a level  with the plain, was but one great sand-bed, about half a mile wide. It  was covered with water, but so scantily that the bottom was scarcely  hidden; for, wide as it is, the average depth of the Platte does not at  this point exceed a foot and a half. Stopping near its bank, we gathered  bois de vache, and made a meal of buffalo meat. Far off, on the other  side, was a green meadow, where we could see the white tents and wagons  of an emigrant camp; and just opposite to us we could discern a group of  men and animals at the water's edge. Four or five horsemen soon entered  the river, and in ten minutes had waded across and clambered up the  loose sand-bank. They were ill-looking fellows, thin and swarthy, with  care-worn, anxious faces and lips rigidly compressed. They had good  cause for anxiety; it was three days since they first encamped here, and  on the night of their"]]]
