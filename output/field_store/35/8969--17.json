What is hardly  less important, these are the precepts which mankind have the strongest  and the most direct inducements for impressing upon one another. By  merely giving to each other prudential instruction or exhortation, they  may gain, or think they gain, nothing: in inculcating on each other the  duty of positive beneficence they have an unmistakeable interest, but  far less in degree: a person may possibly not need the benefits of  others; but he always needs that they should not do him hurt. Thus the  moralities which protect every individual from being harmed by others,  either directly or by being hindered in his freedom of pursuing his own  good, are at once those which he himself has most at heart, and those  which he has the strongest interest in publishing and enforcing by word  and deed. It is by a person's observance of these, that his fitness to  exist as one of the fellowship of human beings, is tested and decided;  for on that depends his being a nuisance or not to those with whom he is  in contact. Now it is these moralities primarily, which compose the  obligations of justice. The most marked cases of injustice, and those  which give the tone to the feeling of repugnance which characterizes the  sentiment, are acts of wrongful aggression, or wrongful exercise of  power over some one; the next are those which consist in wrongfully  withholding from him something which is his due; in both cases,  inflicting on him a positive hurt, either in the form of direct  suffering, or of the privation of some good which he had reasonable  ground, either of a physical or of a social kind, for counting upon.    The same powerful motives which command the observance of these primary  moralities, enjoin the punishment of those who violate them; and as the  impulses of self-defence, of defence of others, and of vengeance, are  all called forth against such persons, retribution, or evil for evil,  becomes closely connected with the sentiment of justice, and is  universally included in the idea. Good for good is also one of the  dictates of justice; and this, though its social utility is evident, and  though it carries with it a natural human feeling, has not at first  sight that obvious connexion with hurt or injury, which, existing in the  most elementary cases of just and unjust, is the source of the  characteristic intensity of the sentiment. But the connexion, though  less obvious, is not less real. He who accepts benefits, and denies a  return of them when needed, inflicts a real hurt, by disappointing one  of the most natural and reasonable of expectations, and one which he  must at least tacitly have encouraged, otherwise the benefits would  seldom have been conferred. The important rank, among human evils and  wrongs, of the disappointment of expectation, is shown in the fact that  it constitutes the principal criminality of two such highly immoral acts  as a breach of friendship and a breach of promise. Few hurts which human  beings can sustain are greater, and none wound more, than when that on  which they habitually and with full assurance relied, fails them in the  hour of need; and few wrongs are greater than this mere withholding of  good; none excite more resentment, either in the person suffering, or in  a sympathizing spectator. The principle, therefore, of giving to each  what they deserve, that is, good for good as well as evil for evil, is  not only included within the idea of Justice as we have defined it, but  is a proper object of that intensity of sentiment, which places the  Just, in human estimation, above the simply Expedient.    Most of the maxims of justice current in the world, and commonly  appealed to in its transactions, are simply instrumental to carrying  into effect the principles of justice which we have now spoken of. That  a person is only responsible for what he has done voluntarily, or could  voluntarily have avoided; that it is unjust to condemn any person  unheard; that the punishment ought to be proportioned to the offence,  and the like, are maxims intended to prevent the just principle of evil  for evil from being perverted to the infliction of evil without that  justification. The greater part of these common maxims have come into  use from the practice of courts of justice, which have been naturally  led to a more complete recognition and elaboration than was likely to  suggest itself to others, of the rules necessary to enable them to  fulfil their double function, of inflicting punishment when due, and of  awarding to each person his right.    That first of judicial virtues, impartiality, is an obligation of  justice, partly for the reason last mentioned; as being a necessary  condition of the fulfilment of the other obligations of justice. But  this is not the only source of the exalted rank, among human  obligations, of those maxims of equality and impartiality, which, both  in popular estimation and in that of the most enlightened, are included  among the precepts of justice. In one point of view, they may be  considered as corollaries from the principles already laid down. If it  is a duty to do to each according to his deserts, returning good for  good as well as repressing evil by evil, it necessarily follows that we  should treat all equally well (when no higher duty forbids) who have  deserved equally well of us, and that society should treat all equally  well who have deserved equally well of it, that is, who have deserved  equally well absolutely. This is the highest abstract standard of social  and distributive justice; towards which all institutions, and the  efforts of all virtuous citizens, should be made in the utmost possible  degree to converge. But this great moral duty rests upon a still deeper  foundation, being a direct emanation from the first principle of morals,  and not a mere logical corollary from secondary or derivative doctrines.  It is involved in the very meaning of Utility, or the  Greatest-Happiness Principle. That principle is a mere form of words  without rational signification, unless one person's happiness, supposed  equal in degree (with the proper allowance made for kind), is counted  for exactly as much as another's. Those conditions being supplied,  Bentham's dictum, 'everybody to count for one, nobody for more than  one,' might be written under the principle of utility as an explanatory  commentary.[D] The equal claim of everybody to happiness in the  estimation of the moralist and the legislator, involves an equal claim  to all the means of happiness, except in so far as the inevitable  conditions of human life, and the general interest, in which that of  every individual is included, set limits to the maxim; and those limits  ought to be strictly construed. As every other maxim of justice, so  this, is by no means applied or held applicable universally; on the  contrary, as I have already remarked, it bends to every person's ideas  of social expediency. But in whatever case it is deemed applicable at  all, it is held to be the dictate of justice. All persons are deemed to  have a _right_ to equality of treatment, except when some recognised  social expediency requires the reverse. And hence all social  inequalities which have ceased to be considered expedient, assume the  character not of simple inexpediency, but of injustice, and appear so  tyrannical, that people are apt to wonder how they ever could have been  tolerated; forgetful that they themselves perhaps tolerate other  inequalities under an equally mistaken notion of expediency, the  correction of which would make that which they approve seem quite as  monstrous as what they have at last learnt to condemn. The entire  history of social improvement has been a series of transitions, by which  one custom or institution after another, from being a supposed primary  necessity of social existence, has passed into the rank of an  universally stigmatized injustice and tyranny. So it has been with the  distinctions of slaves and freemen, nobles and serfs, patricians and  plebeians; and so it will be, and in part already is, with the  aristocracies of colour, race, and sex.    It appears from what has been said, that justice is a name for certain  moral requirements, which, regarded collectively, stand higher in the  scale of social utility, and are therefore of more paramount obligation,  than any others; though particular cases may occur in which some other  social duty is so important, as to overrule any one of the general  maxims of justice. Thus, to save a life, it may not only be allowable,  but a duty, to steal, or take by force, the necessary food or medicine,  or to kidnap, and compel to officiate, the only qualified medical  practitioner. In such cases, as we do not call anything justice which is  not a virtue, we usually say, not that justice must give way to some  other moral principle, but that what is just in ordinary cases is, by  reason of that other principle, not just in the particular case. By this  useful accommodation of language, the character of indefeasibility  attributed to justice is kept up, and we are saved from the necessity of  maintaining that there can be laudable injustice.    The considerations which have now been adduced resolve, I conceive, the  only real difficulty in the utilitarian theory of morals. It has always  been evident that all cases of justice are also cases of expediency: the  difference is in the peculiar sentiment which attaches to the former, as  contradistinguished from the latter. If this characteristic sentiment  has been sufficiently accounted for; if there is no necessity to assume  for it any peculiarity of origin; if it is simply the natural feeling of  resentment, moralized by being made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11242"],[0,"The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti (#16)"],[1,"both sides by naked figures of young men reclining against a wall at  some distance, while a remarkably ugly little S. John can be discerned  in one corner. There is something very powerful and original in the  composition of this sacred picture, which, as in the case of all  Michelangelo's early work, develops the previous traditions of Tuscan  art on lines which no one but himself could have discovered. The  central figure of the Madonna, too, has always seemed to me a thing of  marvellous beauty, and of stupendous power in the strained attitude  and nobly modelled arms. It has often been asked what the male nudes  have got to do with the subject. Probably Michelangelo intended in  this episode to surpass a Madonna by Luca Signorelli, with whose  genius he obviously was in sympathy, and who felt, like him, the  supreme beauty of the naked adolescent form. Signorelli had painted a  circular Madonna with two nudes in the landscape distance for Lorenzo  de' Medici. The picture is hung now in the gallery of the Uffizi. It  is enough perhaps to remark that Michelangelo needed these figures for  his scheme, and for filling the space at his disposal. He was either  unable or unwilling to compose a background of trees, meadows, and  pastoral folk in the manner of his predecessors. Nothing but the  infinite variety of human forms upon a barren stage of stone or arid  earth would suit his haughty sense of beauty. The nine persons who  make up the picture are all carefully studied from the life, and bear  a strong Tuscan stamp. S. John is literally ignoble, and Christ is a  commonplace child. The Virgin Mother is a magnificent _contadina_ in  the plenitude of adult womanhood. Those, however, who follow Mr.  Ruskin in blaming Michelangelo for carelessness about the human face  and head, should not fail to notice what sublime dignity and grace he  has communicated to his model here. In technical execution the Doni  Madonna is faithful to old Florentine usage, but lifeless and  unsympathetic. We are disagreeably reminded by every portion of the  surface that Lionardo's subtle play of tones and modulated shades,  those _sfumature_, as Italians call them, which transfer the mystic  charm of nature to the canvas, were as yet unknown to the great  draughtsman. There is more of atmosphere, of colour suggestion, and of  chiaroscuro in the marble _tondi_ described above. Moreover, in spite  of very careful modelling, Michelangelo has failed to make us feel the  successive planes of his composition. The whole seems flat, and each  distance, instead of being graduated, starts forward to the eye. He  required, at this period of his career, the relief of sculpture in  order to express the roundness of the human form and the relative  depth of objects placed in a receding order. If anything were needed  to make us believe the story of his saying to Pope Julius II. that  sculpture and not painting was his trade, this superb design, so  deficient in the essential qualities of painting proper, would  suffice. Men infinitely inferior to himself in genius and sense of  form, a Perugino, a Francia, a Fra Bartolommeo, an Albertinelli,  possessed more of the magic which evokes pictorial beauty.  Nevertheless, with all its aridity, rigidity, and almost repulsive  hardness of colour, the Doni Madonna ranks among the great pictures of  the world. Once seen it will never be forgotten: it tyrannises and  dominates the imagination by its titanic power of drawing. No one,  except perhaps Lionardo, could draw like that, and Lionardo would not  have allowed his linear scheme to impose itself so remorselessly upon  the mind.      VI    Just at this point of his development, Michelangelo was brought into  competition with Lionardo da Vinci, the only living rival worthy of  his genius. During the year 1503 Piero Soderini determined to adorn  the hall of the Great Council in the Palazzo Vecchio with huge mural  frescoes, which should represent scenes in Florentine history.  Documents regarding the commencement of these works and the contracts  made with the respective artists are unfortunately wanting. But it  appears that Da Vinci received a commission for one of the long walls  in the autumn of that year. We have items of expenditure on record  which show that the Municipality of Florence assigned him the Sala del  Papa at S. Maria Novella before February 1504, and were preparing the  necessary furniture for the construction of his Cartoon. It seems that  he was hard at work upon the 1st of April, receiving fifteen golden  florins a month for his labour. The subject which he chose to treat  was the battle of Anghiari in 1440, when the Florentine mercenaries  entirely routed the troops of Filippo Maria Visconti, led by Niccolo  Piccinino, one of the greatest generals of his age. In August 1504  Soderini commissioned Michelangelo to prepare Cartoons for the  opposite wall of the great Sala, and assigned to him a workshop in the  Hospital of the Dyers at S. Onofrio. A minute of expenditure, under  date October 31, 1504, shows that the paper for the Cartoon had been  already provided; and Michelangelo continued to work upon it until his  call to Rome at the beginning of 1505. Lionardo's battle-piece  consisted of two groups on horseback engaged in a fierce struggle for  a standard. Michelangelo determined to select a subject which should  enable him to display all his power as the supreme draughtsman of the  nude. He chose an episode from the war with Pisa, when, on the 28th of  July 1364, a band of 400 Florentine soldiers were surprised bathing by  Sir John Hawkwood and his English riders. It goes by the name of the  Battle of Pisa, though the event really took place at Cascina on the  Arno, some six miles above that city.    We have every reason to regard the composition of this Cartoon as the  central point in Michelangelo's life as an artist. It was the  watershed, so to speak, which divided his earlier from his later  manner; and if we attach any value to the critical judgment of his  enthusiastic admirer, Cellini, even the roof of the Sistine fell short  of its perfection. Important, however, as it certainly is in the  history of his development, I must defer speaking of it in detail  until the end of the next chapter. For some reason or other, unknown  to us, he left his work unfinished early in 1505, and went, at the  Pope's invitation, to Rome. When he returned, in the ensuing year, to  Florence, he resumed and completed the design. Some notion of its size  may be derived from what we know about the material supplied for  Lionardo's Cartoon. This, say Crowe and Cavalcaselle, \"was made up of  one ream and twenty-nine quires, or about 288 square feet of royal  folio paper, the mere pasting of which necessitated a consumption of  eighty-eight pounds of flour, the mere lining of which required three  pieces of Florentine linen.\"    Condivi, summing up his notes of this period spent by Michelangelo at  Florence, says: \"He stayed there some time without working to much  purpose in his craft, having taken to the study of poets and  rhetoricians in the vulgar tongue, and to the composition of sonnets  for his pleasure.\" It is difficult to imagine how Michelangelo, with  all his engagements, found the leisure to pursue these literary  amusements. But Condivi's biography is the sole authentic source which  we possess for the great master's own recollections of his past life.  It is, therefore, not improbable that in the sentence I have quoted we  may find some explanation of the want of finish observable in his  productions at this point. Michelangelo was, to a large extent, a  dreamer; and this single phrase throws light upon the expanse of time,  the barren spaces, in his long laborious life. The poems we now  possess by his pen are clearly the wreck of a vast multitude; and most  of those accessible in manuscript and print belong to a later stage of  his development. Still the fact remains that in early manhood he  formed the habit of conversing with writers of Italian and of  fashioning his own thoughts into rhyme. His was a nature capable  indeed of vehement and fiery activity, but by constitution somewhat  saturnine and sluggish, only energetic when powerfully stimulated; a  meditative man, glad enough to be inert when not spurred forward on  the path of strenuous achievement. And so, it seems, the literary bent  took hold upon him as a relief from labour, as an excuse for temporary  inaction. In his own art, the art of design, whether this assumed the  form of sculpture or of painting or of architecture, he did nothing  except at the highest pressure. All his accomplished work shows signs  of the intensest cerebration. But he tried at times to slumber, sunk  in a wise passiveness. Then he communed with the poets, the prophets,  and the prose-writers of his country. We can well imagine, therefore,  that, tired with the labours of the chisel or the brush, he gladly  gave himself to composition, leaving half finished on his easel things  which had for him their adequate accomplishment.    I think it necessary to make these suggestions, because, in my  opinion, Michelangelo's inner life and his literary proclivities have  been hitherto too much neglected in the scheme of his psychology.  Dazzled by the splendour of his work, critics are content to skip  spaces of months and years, during which the creative genius of the  man smouldered. It is, as I shall try to show, in those intervals,  dimly revealed to us by what remains of his poems and his  correspondence, that the secret of this man, at once so tardy and so  energetic; has to be discovered.    A great master of a different temperament, less solitary, less  saturnine, less sluggish, would have formed a school, as Raffaello  did. Michelangelo formed no school, and was incapable of confiding the  execution of his designs to any subordinates. This is also a point of  the highest importance to"]]]
