Thus has he warred and won since time began,  Thus does the Indian bring to earth his man.    II    Ungarmented, save for a web that lies  In fleecy folds across his impish eyes,  A tiny archer takes his way intent  On mischief, which is his especial bent.  Across his shoulder lies a quiver, filled  With arrows dipped in honey, thrice distilled  From all the roses brides have ever worn  Since that first wedding out of Eden born.  Beneath a cherub face and dimpled smile  This youthful hunter hides a heart of guile;  His arrows aimed at random fly in quest  Of lodging-place within some blameless breast.  But those he wounds die happily, and so  Blame not young Cupid with his dart and bow:  Thus has he warred and won since time began,  Transporting into Heaven both maid and man.        THE WOLF      Like a grey shadow lurking in the light,  He ventures forth along the edge of night;  With silent foot he scouts the coulie's rim  And scents the carrion awaiting him.  His savage eyeballs lurid with a flare  Seen but in unfed beasts which leave their lair  To wrangle with their fellows for a meal  Of bones ill-covered. Sets he forth to steal,  To search and snarl and forage hungrily;  A worthless prairie vagabond is he.  Luckless the settler's heifer which astray  Falls to his fangs and violence a prey;  Useless her blatant calling when his teeth  Are fast upon her quivering flank--beneath  His fell voracity she falls and dies  With inarticulate and piteous cries,  Unheard, unheeded in the barren waste,  To be devoured with savage greed and haste.  Up the horizon once again he prowls  And far across its desolation howls;  Sneaking and satisfied his lair he gains  And leaves her bones to bleach upon the plains.        THE MAN IN CHRYSANTHEMUM LAND      WRITTEN FOR \"THE SPECTATOR\"    There's a brave little berry-brown man  At the opposite side of the earth;  Of the White, and the Black, and the Tan,  He's the smallest in compass and girth.  O! he's little, and lively, and Tan,  And he's showing the world what he's worth.  For his nation is born, and its birth  Is for hardihood, courage, and sand,    So you take off your cap    To the brave little Jap  Who fights for Chrysanthemum Land.    Near the house that the little man keeps,  There's a Bug-a-boo building its lair;  It prowls, and it growls, and it sleeps  At the foot of his tiny back stair.  But the little brown man never sleeps,  For the Brownie will battle the Bear--  He has soldiers and ships to command;    So take off you cap    To the brave little Jap  Who fights for Chrysanthemum Land.    Uncle Sam stands a-watching near by,  With his finger aside of his nose--  John Bull with a wink in his eye,  Looks round to see how the wind blows--  O! jolly old John, with his eye  Ever set on the East and its woes.  More than hoeing their own little rows  These wary old wags understand,    But they take off their caps    To the brave little Japs  Who fight for Chrysanthemum Land.    Now he's given us Geishas, and themes  For operas, stories, and plays,  His silks and his chinas are dreams,  And we copy his quaint little ways;  O! we look on his land in our dreams,  But his value we failed to appraise,  For he'll gather his laurels and bays--  His Cruisers and Columns are manned,    And we take off our caps    To the brave little Japs  Who fight for Chrysanthemum Land.        CALGARY OF THE PLAINS      Not of the seething cities with their swarming human hives,  Their fetid airs, their reeking streets, their dwarfed and poisoned lives,  Not of the buried yesterdays, but of the days to be,  The glory and the gateway of the yellow West is she.    The Northern Lights dance down her plains with soft and silvery feet,  The sunrise gilds her prairies when the dawn and daylight meet;  Along her level lands the fitful southern breezes sweep,  And beyond her western windows the sublime old mountains sleep.    The Redman haunts her portals, and the Paleface treads her streets,  The Indian's stealthy footstep with the course of commerce meets,  And hunters whisper vaguely of the half forgotten tales  Of phantom herds of bison lurking on her midnight trails.    Not hers the lore of olden lands, their laurels and their bays;  But what are these, compared to one of all her perfect days?  For naught can buy the jewel that upon her forehead lies--  The cloudless sapphire Heaven of her territorial skies.        THE BALLAD OF YAADA [5]      (A LEGEND OF THE PACIFIC COAST)    There are fires on Lulu Island, and the sky is opalescent    With the pearl and purple tinting from the smouldering of peat.  And the Dream Hills lift their summits in a sweeping, hazy crescent,    With the Capilano canyon at their feet.    There are fires on Lulu Island, and the smoke, uplifting, lingers    In a faded scarf of fragrance as it creeps across the day,  And the Inlet and the Narrows blur beneath its silent fingers,    And the canyon is enfolded in its grey.    But the sun its face is veiling like a cloistered nun at vespers;    As towards the alter candles of the night a censer swings,  And the echo of tradition wakes from slumbering and whispers,    Where the Capilano river sobs and sings.    It was Yaada, lovely Yaada, who first taught the stream its sighing,    For 'twas silent till her coming, and 'twas voiceless as the shore;  But throughout the great forever it will sing the song undying    That the lips of lovers sing for evermore.    He was chief of all the Squamish, and he ruled the coastal waters--    And he warred upon her people in the distant Charlotte Isles;  She, a winsome basket weaver, daintiest of Haida daughters,    Made him captive to her singing and her smiles.    Till his hands forgot to havoc and his weapons lost their lusting,    Till his stormy eyes allured her from the land of Totem Poles,  Till she followed where he called her, followed with a woman's trusting,    To the canyon where the Capilano rolls.    And the women of the Haidas plied in vain their magic power,    Wailed for many moons her absence, wailed for many moons their prayer,  \"Bring her back, O Squamish foeman, bring to us our Yaada flower!\"    But the silence only answered their despair.    But the men were swift to battle, swift to cross the coastal water,    Swift to war and swift of weapon, swift to paddle trackless miles,  Crept with stealth along the canyon, stole her from her love and brought her    Once again unto the distant Charlotte Isles.    But she faded, ever faded, and her eyes were ever turning    Southward toward the Capilano, while her voice had hushed its song,  And her riven heart repeated words that on her lips were burning:    \"Not to friend--but unto foeman I belong.    \"Give me back my Squamish lover--though you hate, I still must love him.    \"Give me back the rugged canyon where my heart must ever be--  Where his lodge awaits my coming, and the Dream Hills lift above him,    And the Capilano learned its song from me.\"    But through long-forgotten seasons, moons too many to be numbered,    He yet waited by the canyon--she called across the years,  And the soul within the river, though centuries had slumbered,    Woke to sob a song of womanly tears.    For her little, lonely spirit sought the Capilano canyon,    When she died among the Haidas in the land of Totem Poles,  And you yet may hear her singing to her lover-like companion,    If you listen to the river as it rolls.    But 'tis only when the pearl and purple smoke is idly swinging    From the fires on Lulu Island to the hazy mountain crest,  That the undertone of sobbing echoes through the river's singing,    In the Capilano canyon of the West.        [5] \"The Ballad of Yaada\" is the last complete poem written by the    author. It was placed for publication with the \"Saturday Night\" of    Toronto, and did not appear in print until several months after    Miss Johnson's death.        \"AND HE SAID, FIGHT ON\" [6]      (Tennyson)    Time and its ally, Dark Disarmament,      Have compassed me about,  Have massed their armies, and on battle bent      My forces put to rout;  But though I fight alone, and fall, and die,      Talk terms of Peace? Not I.    They war upon my fortress, and their guns      Are shattering its walls;  My army plays the cowards' part, and runs,      Pierced by a thousand balls;  They call for my surrender. I reply,      \"Give quarter now? Not I.\"    They've shot my flag to ribbons, but in rents      It floats above the height;  Their ensign shall not crown my battlements      While I can stand and fight.  I fling defiance at them as I cry,      \"Capitulate? Not I.\"        [6] E. Pauline Johnson died March 7th, 1913. Shortly after the    doctors told her that her illness would be her final one, she    wrote the above poem, taking a line from Tennyson as her theme."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5630"],[0,"The Story of \"Mormonism\" and The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\" (#15)"],[1," fitness to receive it, be  he heathen or civilized, living or dead.    The whole duty of man is to live and work according to the  highest laws of right made known to him, to walk according to the  best light that has been shed about his path; and while Justice  shall deny to every soul that has not rendered obedience to the  law, entrance into the kingdom of the blessed, Mercy shall claim  opportunity for all who, have shown themselves willing to receive  the truth and obey its behests.    It will be seen, then, that \"Mormonism\" offers no modified or  conditional claims as to the necessity of compliance with the  laws and ordinances of the gospel by every responsible inhabitant  of earth unto whom salvation shall come.  It distinguishes not  between enlightened and heathen nations, nor between men of high  and low intelligence; nor even between the living and the dead.  No human being who has attained years of accountability in the  flesh, may hope for salvation in the kingdom of God until he has  rendered obedience to the requirements of Christ, the Redeemer of  the world.    But while thus decisive, \"Mormonism\" is not exclusive.  It does  not claim that all who have failed to accept and obey the gospel  of eternal life shall be eternally and forever damned.  While  boldly asserting that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints is the sole repository of the Holy Priesthood as now  restored to earth, it teaches and demands the fullest toleration  for all individuals, and organizations of individuals, professing  righteousness; and holds that each shall be rewarded for the  measure of good he has wrought, to be adjudged in accordance with  the spiritual knowledge he has gained.  For such high claims  combined with such professions of tolerance, the Church has been  accused of inconsistency.  Let it not be forgotten, however, that  toleration is not acceptance.  I may believe with the utmost  fulness of my soul's powers that I am right and my neighbor is  wrong concerning any proposition or principle; but such  conviction gives me no semblance of right for interfering with  his exercise of freedom.  The only bounds to the liberty of an  individual are such as mark the liberty of another, or the rights  of the community.  God himself treats as sacred, and therefore as  inviolable, the freedom of the human soul.       \"Know this, that every soul is free      To choose his life and what he'll be;      For this eternal truth is given,      That God will force no man to heaven.       \"He'll call, persuade, direct aright,      Bless him with wisdom, love, and light;      In nameless ways be good and kind,      But never force the human mind.\"    \"Mormonism\" contends that no man or nation possesses the right to  forcibly deprive even the heathen of his right to worship his  deity.  Though idolatry has been marked from the earliest ages  with the seal of divine disfavor, it may represent in the  unenlightened soul the sincerest reverence of which the person is  capable.  He should be taught better, but not compelled to render  worship which to him is false because in violation of his  conscience.    In further defense of the Latter-day Saints against the charge of  inconsistency for this their tolerance toward others whom they  verily believe to be wrong, let me again urge the cardinal  principle that every man is accountable for his acts, and shall  be judged in the light of the law as made known to him.    There is no claim of universal forgiveness; no unwarranted  glorification of Mercy to the degrading or neglect of Justice; no  thought that a single sin of omission or of commission shall fail  to leave its wound or scar.  In the great future there shall be  found a place for every soul, whatever his grade of spiritual  intelligence may be.  \"In my Father's house are many mansions,\"  (John 14:2), declared the Savior to his apostles; and Paul adds,  \"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial; but the  glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial  is another.  There is one glory of the sun and another glory of  the moon and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth  from another star in glory.  So also is the resurrection of the  dead,\" (I Cor. 15:40-42).  The Latter-day Saints claim a  revelation of the present dispensation as supplementing the  scripture just quoted.  From this later scripture (see D&C, Sec.  76), we learn that there are three well-defined degrees in the  future state, with numerous, perhaps numberless, gradations.    There is the _celestial state_ provided for those who have lived  the whole law, who have accepted the testimony of the Christ, who  have complied with the required ordinances of the gospel, who  have been valiant in the cause of virtue and truth.  Then there  is the _terrestrial state_, comparable to the first as is the  moon to the sun.  This shall be given to the less valiant, to  many who are nevertheless among the worthy men of the earth, but  who perchance have been deceived as to the gospel and its  requirements.  The _telestial state_ is for those who have failed  to live according to the light given them; those who have had to  suffer the results of their sins; those who have been of Moses,  of Paul, of Apollos, and of any one of a multitude of others, but  not of the Christ.    We hold that there is a wide difference between salvation and  exaltation; that there are infinite gradations beyond the grave  as there are here, and as there were in the state preceding this.    \"Mormonism\" is frequently spoken of as a new religion, and the  Church as a new church, a mere addition of one to the many sects  that have so long striven for recognition and ascendency among  men.  It is new only as the springtime following the darkness and  the cold of the year's night is new.  The Church is a new one  only as the ripening fruit is a new development in the course of  the tree's growth.  In a general and true sense, \"Mormonism\" is  not new to the world.  It is founded on the gospel of Christ  which antedates this earth.  The establishment of the Church in  the present age was but a restoration.  True, the Church is  progressive as it ever has been; it is therefore productive of  more and greater things as the years link themselves into the  centuries; but the living seed contains within its husk all the  possibilities of the mature plant.    This so-called new, modern gospel is in fact the old one, the  first one, come again.  It demands the organization and the  authority characteristic of the Church in former days, when there  was a Church of God upon the earth; it expects no more  consideration, and scarcely hopes for greater popularity, than  were accorded the primitive Church.  Opposition, persecution, and  martyrdom have been its portion, but these tribulations it  accepts, knowing well that to bear such has been the lot of the  true Church in every age.    \"Mormonism\" is more than a code of morals; it claims a higher  rank than that of an organization of men planned and instituted  by the wisdom and philosophy of men, however worthy.  It draws a  distinction between morality and religion; and affirms that human  duty is not comprised in a mere avoidance of sin.  It regards the  strictest morality as an indispensable feature of every religious  system claiming in any degree divine recognition; and yet it  looks upon morality as but the alphabet from which the words and  sentences of a truly religious life may be framed.  However  euphonious the words, however eloquent the periods, to make the  writing of highest worth there must be present the divine  thought; and this, man of himself cannot conceive.    It affirms that there was a yesterday as there is a today, and  shall be a tomorrow, in the dealings of God with men; that        Through the ages one increasing purpose runs;    and that purpose,--the working out of a divine plan, the ultimate  object of which is the salvation and exaltation of the human  family.    The central feature of that plan was the earthly ministry and  redeeming sacrifice of the Christ in the meridian of time; the  consummation shall be ushered in by the return of that same  Christ to earth as the Rewarder of righteousness, the Avenger of  iniquity, and as the world's Judge.    The Church holds that in the light of revelation, ancient and  modern, and by a fair interpretation of the signs of the times,  the second coming of the Redeemer is near at hand.  The present  is the final dispensation of the earth in its present state;  these are the last days of which the prophets in all ages have  sung.    But of what use are theories and philosophies of religion without  practical application?  Of what avail is belief as a mere mental  assent or denial?  Let it develop into virile faith; vitalize it;  animate it; then it becomes a moving power.  The Latter-day  Saints point with some confidence to what they have attempted and  begun, and to the little they have already done in the line of  their convictions, as proof of their sincerity.    For the second coming of the Redeemer, preparation is demanded of  men; and today, instead of the single priest crying in the  wilderness of Judaea, there are thousands going forth among the  nations with a message as definite and as important as that of  the Baptist; and their proclamation is a reiteration of the voice  in the desert--\"Repent Repent! for the Kingdom of Heaven is at  hand.\"      The philosophy of \"Mormonism\" rests on the literal acceptance of  a living, personal God, and on the unreserved compliance with his  law as from time to time revealed."]]]
