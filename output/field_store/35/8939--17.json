If that were possible to-day,  I would propose all the stages of non-co-operation to be worked  simultaneously. But we have not secured that control over the masses, we  have uselessly frittered away precious years of the nation's life in  mastering a language which we need least for winning our liberty; we  have frittered away all those years in learning liberty from Milton and  Shakespeare, in deriving inspiration from the pages of Mill, whilst  liberty could be learnt at our doors. We have thus succeeded in  isolating ourselves from the masses: we have been westernised. We have  failed these 35 years to utilise our education in order to permeate the  masses. We have sat upon the pedestal and from there delivered harangues  to them in a language they do not understand and we see to-day that we  are unable to conduct large gatherings in a disciplined manner. And  discipline is the essence of success. Here is therefore one reason why I  have introduced the word 'progressive' in the non-co-operation  Resolution. Without any impertinence I may say that I understand the  mass mind better than any one amongst the educated Indians. I contend  that the masses are not ready for suspension of payment of taxes. They  have not yet learnt sufficient self-control. If I was sure of  non-violence on their part I would ask them to suspend payment to-day  and not waste a single moment of the nations time. With me the liberty  of India has become a passion. Liberty of Islam is as dear to me. I  would not therefore delay a moment if I found that the whole of the  programme could be enforced at once.    It grieves me to miss the faces of dear and revered leaders in this  assembly. We miss here the trumpet voice of Surendranath Banorji, who  has rendered inestimable service to the country. And though we stand as  poles asunder to-day, though we may have sharp differences with him, we  must express them with becoming restraint. I do not ask you to give up a  single iota of principle. I urge non-violence in language and in deed.  If non-violence is essential in our dealings with Government, it is more  essential in our dealings with our leaders. And it grieves me deeply to  hear of recent instances of violence reported to have been used in East  Bongal against our own people. I was pained to hear that the ears of a  man who had voted at the recent elections had been cut, and night soil  had been thrown into the bed of a man who had stood as a candidate.  Non-co-operation is never going to succeed in this way. It will not  succeed unless we create an atmosphere of perfect freedom, unless we  prize our opponents liberty as much as our own. The liberty of faith,  conscience, thought and action which we claim for ourselves must be  conceded equally to others. Non co-operation is a process of  purification and we must continually try to touch the hearts of those  who differ from us, their minds, and their emotions, but never their  bodies. Discipline and restraint are the cardinal principles of our  conduct and I warn you against any sort of tyrannical social ostracism.  I was deeply grieved therefore to hear of the insult offered to a dead  body in Delhi and feel that if it was the action of non-co-operators  they have disgraced themselves and their creed. I repeat we cannot  deliver our land through violence.    It was not a joke when I said on the congress platform that Swaraj could  be established in one year if there was sufficient response from the  nation. Three months of this year are gone. If we are true to our salt,  true to our nation, true to the songs we sing, if we are true to the  Bhagwad Gita and the Koran, we would finish the programme in the  remaining nine months and deliver Islam the Punjab and India.    I have proposed a limited programme workable within one year, having a  special regard to the educated classes. We seem to be labouring under  the illusion that we cannot possibly live without Councils, law courts  and schools provided by the Government. The moment we are disillusioned  we have Swaraj. It is demoralising both for Government and the governed  that a hundred thousand pilgrims should dictate terms to a nation  composed of three hundred millions. And how is it they can thus dictate  terms. It is because we have been divided and they have ruled. I have  never forgotten Humes' frank confession that the British Government was  sustained by the policy of \"Divide and Rule.\" Therefore it is that I  have laid stress upon Hindu Muslim Unity as one of the important  essentials for the success of Non-co-operation. But, it should be no lip  unity, nor bunia unity it should be a unity broad based on a recognition  of the heart. If we want to save Hinduism, I say for Gods sake, do not  seek to bargain with the Mussalmans. I have been going about with  Maulana Shaukat Ali all these months, but I have not so much as  whispered anything about the protection of the cow. My alliance with the  Ali Brothers is one of honour. I feel that I am on my honour, the whole  of Hinduism is on its honour, and if it will not be found wanting, it  will do its duty towards the Mussalmans of India. Any bargaining would  be degrading to us. Light brings light not darkness, and nobility done  with a noble purpose will be twice rewarded. It will be God alone who  can protect the cow. Ask me not to-day--'what about the cow,' ask me  after Islam is vindicated through India. Ask the Rajas what they do to  entertain their English guests. Do they not provide beef and champagne  for their guests. Persuade them first to stop cow killing and then think  of bargaining with Mussalmans. And how are we Hindus behaving ourselves  towards the cow and her progeny! Do we treat her as our religion  requires us? Not till we have set our own house in order and saved the  cow from the Englishmen have we the right to plead on her behalf with  the Mussalmans. And the best way of saving the cow from them is to give  them unconditional help in their hour of trouble.    Similarly what do we owe the Punjab? The whole of India was made to  crawl on her belly in as much as a single Punjabi was made to crawl in  that dirty lane in Amritsar, the whole womanhood of India was unveiled  in as much as the innocent woman of Manianwalla were unveiled by an  insolent office; and Indian childhood was dishonoured in that, that  school children of tender age were made to walk four times a day to  stated places within the martial area in the Punjab and to salute the  Union Jack, through the effect of which order two children, seven years  old died of sunstroke having been made to wait in the noonday sun. In my  opinion it is a sin to attend the schools and colleges conducted under  the aegis of this Government so long as it has not purged itself of  these crimes by proper repentance. We may not with any sense of  self-respect plead before the courts of the Government when we remember  that it was through the Punjab Courts that innocent men were sentenced  to be imprisoned and hanged. We become participators in the crime of the  Government by voluntarily helping it or being helped by it.    The women of India have intuitively understood the spiritual nature of  the struggle. Thousands have attended to listen to the message of  non-violent non-co-operation and have given me their precious ornaments  for the purpose of advancing the cause of Swaraj. Is it any wonder if I  believe the possibility of gaining Swaraj within a year after all these  wonderful demonstrations? I would be guilty of want of faith in God if I  under-rated the significance of the response from the women of India. I  hope that the students will do their duty. The country certainly expects  the lawyers who have hitherto led public agitation to recognise the new  awakening.    I have used strong language but I have done so with the greatest  deliberation, I am not actuated by any feeling of revenge. I do not  consider Englishmen as my enemy. I recognise the worth of many. I enjoy  the privilege of having many English friends, but I am a determined  enemy of the English rule as is conducted at present and if the  power--tapasya--of one man could destroy it, I would certainly destroy  it, if it could not be mended. An Empire that stands for injustice and  breach of faith does not deserve to stand if its custodians will not  repent and non-co-operation has been devised in order to enable the  nation to compel justice.    I hope that Bengal will take her proper place in this movement of  self-purification. Bengal began Swadeshi and national education when the  rest of India was sleeping. I hope that Bengal will come to the front  in this movement for gaining Swaraj and gaining justice for the Khilafat  and the Punjab through purification and self-sacrifice.      ON THE WRONG TRACK    Lord Ronaldshay has been doing me the favour of reading my booklet on  Indian Home Rule which is a translation of Hind Swaraj. His Lordship  told his audience that if Swaraj meant what I had described it to be in  the booklet, the Bengalis would have none of it. I am sorry that Swaraj  of the Congress resolution does not mean the Swaraj depicted in the  booklet; Swaraj according to the Congress means Swaraj that the people  of India want, not what the British Government may condescend to give.  In so far as I can see, Swaraj will be a Parliament chosen by the people  with the fullest power over the finance, the police, the military, the  navy, the courts, and the educational institutions.    I am free to confess that the Swaraj I expect to gain within one year,  if India responds will be such Swaraj as will make practically  impossible the repetition of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, and  will enable the nation to do good or evil as it chooses, and not he  'good' at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10376"],[0,"American Indian Stories (#16)"],[1,"country, said: 'I am a man. You are  another. The Great Spirit is our witness!' This is simple and easy to  understand, but the times are changed. The white man's laws are  strange.\"    Blue-Star Woman broke off a piece of fried bread between a thumb and  forefinger. She ate it hungrily, and sipped from her cup of fragrant  coffee. \"I do not understand the white man's law. It's like walking in  the dark. In this darkness, I am growing fearful of everything.\"    Oblivious to the world, she had not heard the footfall of two Indian men  who now stood before her.    Their short-cropped hair looked blue-black in contrast to the faded  civilian clothes they wore. Their white man's shoes were rusty and  unpolished. To the unconventional eyes of the old Indian woman, their  celluloid collars appeared like shining marks of civilization. Blue-Star  Woman looked up from the lap of mother earth without rising. \"Hinnu,  hinnu!\" she ejaculated in undisguised surprise. \"Pray, who are these  would-be white men?\" she inquired.    In one voice and by an assumed relationship the two Indian men addressed  her. \"Aunt, I shake hands with you.\" Again Blue-Star Woman remarked,  \"Oh, indeed! these near white men speak my native tongue and shake hands  according to our custom.\" Did she guess the truth, she would have known  they were simply deluded mortals, deceiving others and themselves most  of all. Boisterously laughing and making conversation, they each in turn  gripped her withered hand.    Like a sudden flurry of wind, tossing loose ends of things, they broke  into her quiet morning hour and threw her groping thoughts into greater  chaos. Masking their real errand with long-drawn faces, they feigned a  concern for her welfare only. \"We come to ask how you are living. We  heard you were slowly starving to death. We heard you are one of those  Indians who have been cheated out of their share in tribal lands by the  government officials.\"    Blue-Star Woman became intensely interested.    \"You see we are educated in the white man's ways,\" they said with  protruding chests. One unconsciously thrust his thumbs into the  arm-holes of his ill-fitting coat and strutted about in his pride. \"We  can help you get your land. We want to help our aunt. All old people  like you ought to be helped before the younger ones. The old will die  soon, and they may never get the benefit of their land unless some one  like us helps them to get their rights, without further delay.\"    Blue-Star Woman listened attentively.    Motioning to the mats she spread upon the ground, she said: \"Be seated,  my nephews.\" She accepted the relationship assumed for the occasion. \"I  will give you some breakfast.\" Quickly she set before them a generous  helping of fried bread and cups of coffee. Resuming her own meal, she  continued, \"You are wonderfully kind. It is true, my nephews, that I  have grown old trying to secure my share of land. It may not be long  till I shall pass under the sod.\"    The two men responded with \"How, how,\" which meant, \"Go on with your  story. We are all ears.\" Blue-Star Woman had not yet detected any  particular sharpness about their ears, but by an impulse she looked up  into their faces and scrutinized them. They were busily engaged in  eating. Their eyes were fast upon the food on the mat in front of their  crossed shins. Inwardly she made a passing observation how, like  ravenous wolves, her nephews devoured their food. Coyotes in midwinter  could not have been more starved. Without comment she offered them the  remaining fried cakes, and between them they took it all. She offered  the second helping of coffee, which they accepted without hesitancy.  Filling their cups, she placed her empty coffeepot on the dead ashes.    To them she rehearsed her many hardships. It had become a habit now to  tell her long story of disappointments with all its petty details. It  was only another instance of good intentions gone awry. It was a paradox  upon a land of prophecy that its path to future glory be stained with  the blood of its aborigines. Incongruous as it is, the two nephews, with  their white associates, were glad of a condition so profitable to them.  Their solicitation for Blue-Star Woman was not at all altruistic. They  thrived in their grafting business. They and their occupation were the  by-product of an unwieldly bureaucracy over the nation's wards.    \"Dear aunt, you failed to establish the facts of your identity,\" they  told her. Hereupon Blue-Star Woman's countenance fell. It was ever the  same old words. It was the old song of the government official she  loathed to hear. The next remark restored her courage. \"If any one can  discover evidence, it's us! I tell you, aunt, we'll fix it all up for  you.\" It was a great relief to the old Indian woman to be thus  unburdened of her riddle, with a prospect of possessing land. \"There is  one thing you will have to do,--that is, to pay us half of your land and  money when you get them.\" Here was a pause, and Blue-Star Woman answered  slowly, \"Y-e-s,\" in an uncertain frame of mind.    The shrewd schemers noted her behavior. \"Wouldn't you rather have a half  of a crust of bread than none at all?\" they asked. She was duly  impressed with the force of their argument. In her heart she agreed, \"A  little something to eat is better than nothing!\" The two men talked in  regular relays. The flow of smooth words was continuous and so much like  purring that all the woman's suspicions were put soundly to sleep. \"Look  here, aunt, you know very well that prairie fire is met with a  back-fire.\" Blue-Star Woman, recalling her experiences in fire-fighting,  quickly responded, \"Yes, oh, yes.\"    \"In just the same way, we fight crooks with crooks. We have clever white  lawyers working with us. They are the back-fire.\" Then, as if  remembering some particular incident, they both laughed aloud and said,  \"Yes, and sometimes they use us as the back-fire! We trade fifty-fifty.\"    Blue-Star Woman sat with her chin in the palm of one hand with elbow  resting in the other. She rocked herself slightly forward and backward.  At length she answered, \"Yes, I will pay you half of my share in tribal  land and money when I get them. In bygone days, brave young men of the  order of the White-Horse-Riders sought out the aged, the poor, the  widows and orphans to aid them, but they did their good work without  pay. The White-Horse-Riders are gone. The times are changed. I am a poor  old Indian woman. I need warm clothing before winter begins to blow its  icicles through us. I need fire wood. I need food. As you have said, a  little help is better than none.\"    Hereupon the two pretenders scored another success.    They rose to their feet. They had eaten up all the fried bread and  drained the coffeepot. They shook hands with Blue-Star Woman and  departed. In the quiet that followed their departure she sat munching  her small piece of bread, which, by a lucky chance, she had taken on her  plate before the hungry wolves had come. Very slowly she ate the  fragment of fried bread as if to increase it by diligent mastication. A  self-condemning sense of guilt disturbed her. In her dire need she had  become involved with tricksters. Her nephews laughingly told her, \"We  use crooks, and crooks use us in the skirmish over Indian lands.\"    The friendly shade of the house shrank away from her and hid itself  under the narrow eaves of the dirt covered roof. She shrugged her  shoulders. The sun high in the sky had witnessed the affair and now  glared down upon her white head. Gathering upon her arm the mats and  cooking utensils, she hobbled into her log hut.    Under the brooding wilderness silence, on the Sioux Indian Reservation,  the superintendent summoned together the leading Indian men of the  tribe. He read a letter which he had received from headquarters in  Washington, D.C. It announced the enrollment of Blue-Star Woman on their  tribal roll of members and the approval of allotting land to her.    It came as a great shock to the tribesmen. Without their knowledge and  consent their property was given to a strange woman. They protested in  vain. The superintendent said, \"I received this letter from Washington.  I have read it to you for your information. I have fulfilled my duty. I  can do no more.\" With these fateful words he dismissed the assembly.    Heavy hearted, Chief High Flier returned to his dwelling. Smoking his  long-stemmed pipe he pondered over the case of Blue-Star Woman. The  Indian's guardian had got into a way of usurping autocratic power in  disposing of the wards' property. It was growing intolerable. \"No doubt  this Indian woman is entitled to allotment, but where? Certainly not  here,\" he thought to himself.    Laying down his pipe, he called his little granddaughter from her play,  \"You are my interpreter and scribe,\" he said. \"Bring your paper and  pencil.\" A letter was written in the child's sprawling hand, and signed  by the old chieftain. It read:    \"My Friend:    \"I make letter to you. My heart is sad. Washington give my tribe's land  to a woman called Blue-Star. We do not know her. We were not asked to  give land, but our land is taken from us to give to another Indian. This  is not right. Lots of little children of my tribe have no land. Why this  strange woman get our land which belongs to our children? Go to  Washington and ask if our treaties tell him to give our property away  without asking us. Tell him I thought we made good treaties on paper,  but now our children cry for food. We are too poor. We cannot give even  to our own little children. Washington is very rich. Washington now  owns our country. If he wants to help this poor Indian woman, Blue-Star,  let him give her some of his land and his money. This is all I will say  until you answer me. I shake hands with you with my heart. The Great  Spirit hears my words. They are true.    \"Your friend,    \"CHIEF HIGH FLIER.    \"X (his"]]]
