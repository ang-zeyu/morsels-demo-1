I am about to descend into  that cupboard and to bring you one of those tablets.  I saw you lock  the cupboard half an hour ago, and I know you have the key in your  possession.  But I descend from Space; the doors, you see, remain  unmoved.  Now I am in the cupboard and am taking the tablet.  Now I  have it.  Now I ascend with it.    I rushed to the closet and dashed the door open.  One of the tablets  was gone.  With a mocking laugh, the Stranger appeared in the other  corner of the room, and at the same time the tablet appeared upon the  floor.  I took it up.  There could be no doubt--it was the missing  tablet.    I groaned with horror, doubting whether I was not out of my sense; but  the Stranger continued:  \"Surely you must now see that my explanation,  and no other, suits the phenomena.  What you call Solid things are  really superficial; what you call Space is really nothing but a great  Plane.  I am in Space, and look down upon the insides of the things of  which you only see the outsides.  You could leave the Plane yourself,  if you could but summon up the necessary volition.  A slight upward or  downward motion would enable you to see all that I can see.    \"The higher I mount, and the further I go from your Plane, the more I  can see, though of course I see it on a smaller scale.  For example, I  am ascending; now I can see your neighbour the Hexagon and his family  in their several apartments; now I see the inside of the Theatre, ten  doors off, from which the audience is only just departing; and on the  other side a Circle in his study, sitting at his books.  Now I shall  come back to you.  And, as a crowning proof, what do you say to my  giving you a touch, just the least touch, in your stomach?  It will not  seriously injure you, and the slight pain you may suffer cannot be  compared with the mental benefit you will receive.\"    Before I could utter a word of remonstrance, I felt a shooting pain in  my inside, and a demoniacal laugh seemed to issue from within me.  A  moment afterwards the sharp agony had ceased, leaving nothing but a  dull ache behind, and the Stranger began to reappear, saying, as he  gradually increased in size, \"There, I have not hurt you much, have I?  If you are not convinced now, I don't know what will convince you.  What say you?\"    My resolution was taken.  It seemed intolerable that I should endure  existence subject to the arbitrary visitations of a Magician who could  thus play tricks with one's very stomach.  If only I could in any way  manage to pin him against the wall till help came!    Once more I dashed my hardest angle against him, at the same time  alarming the whole household by my cries for aid.  I believe, at the  moment of my onset, the Stranger had sunk below our Plane, and really  found difficulty in rising.  In any case he remained motionless, while  I, hearing, as I thought, the sound of some help approaching, pressed  against him with redoubled vigor, and continued to shout for assistance.    A convulsive shudder ran through the Sphere.  \"This must not be,\" I  thought I heard him say:  \"either he must listen to reason, or I must  have recourse to the last resource of civilization.\" Then, addressing  me in a louder tone, he hurriedly exclaimed, \"Listen: no stranger must  witness what you have witnessed.  Send your Wife back at once, before  she enters the apartment.  The Gospel of Three Dimensions must not be  thus frustrated.  Not thus must the fruits of one thousand years of  waiting be thrown away.  I hear her coming.  Back! back!  Away from me,  or you must go with me--wither you know not--into the Land of Three  Dimensions!\"    \"Fool!  Madman!  Irregular!\" I exclaimed; \"never will I release thee;  thou shalt pay the penalty of thine impostures.\"    \"Ha!  Is it come to this?\" thundered the Stranger:  \"then meet your  fate: out of your Plane you go.  Once, twice, thrice!  'Tis done!\"          SECTION 18  How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there      An unspeakable horror seized me.  There was a darkness; then a dizzy,  sickening sensation of sight that was not like seeing; I saw a Line  that was no Line; Space that was not Space:  I was myself, and not  myself.  When I could find voice, I shrieked loud in agony, \"Either  this is madness or it is Hell.\"  \"It is neither,\" calmly replied the  voice of the Sphere, \"it is Knowledge; it is Three Dimensions:  open  your eye once again and try to look steadily.\"    I looked, and, behold, a new world!  There stood before me, visibly  incorporate, all that I had before inferred, conjectured, dreamed, of  perfect Circular beauty.  What seemed the centre of the Stranger's form  lay open to my view:  yet I could see no heart, lungs, nor arteries,  only a beautiful harmonious Something--for which I had no words; but  you, my Readers in Spaceland, would call it the surface of the Sphere.    Prostrating myself mentally before my Guide, I cried, \"How is it, O  divine ideal of consummate loveliness and wisdom that I see thy inside,  and yet cannot discern thy heart, thy lungs, thy arteries, thy liver?\"  \"What you think you see, you see not,\" he replied; \"it is not giving to  you, nor to any other Being, to behold my internal parts. I am of a  different order of Beings from those in Flatland.  Were I a Circle, you  could discern my intestines, but I am a Being, composed as I told you  before, of many Circles, the Many in the One, called in this country a  Sphere.  And, just as the outside of a Cube is a Square, so the outside  of a Sphere represents the appearance of a Circle.\"    Bewildered though I was by my Teacher's enigmatic utterance, I no  longer chafed against it, but worshipped him in silent adoration.  He  continued, with more mildness in his voice.  \"Distress not yourself if  you cannot at first understand the deeper mysteries of Spaceland.  By  degrees they will dawn upon you.  Let us begin by casting back a glance  at the region whence you came.  Return with me a while to the plains of  Flatland and I will shew you that which you have often reasoned and  thought about, but never seen with the sense of sight--a visible  angle.\"  \"Impossible!\" I cried; but, the Sphere leading the way, I  followed as if in a dream, till once more his voice arrested me: \"Look  yonder, and behold your own Pentagonal house, and all its inmates.\"    I looked below, and saw with my physical eye all that domestic  individuality which I had hitherto merely inferred with the  understanding.  And how poor and shadowy was the inferred conjecture in  comparison with the reality which I now behold!  My four Sons calmly  asleep in the North-Western rooms, my two orphan Grandsons to the  South; the Servants, the Butler, my Daughter, all in their several  apartments.  Only my affectionate Wife, alarmed by my continued  absence, had quitted her room and was roving up and down in the Hall,  anxiously awaiting my return.  Also the Page, aroused by my cries, had  left his room, and under pretext of ascertaining whether I had fallen  somewhere in a faint, was prying into the cabinet in my study.  All  this I could now SEE, not merely infer; and as we came nearer and  nearer, I could discern even the contents of my cabinet, and the two  chests of gold, and the tablets of which the Sphere had made mention.    Touched by my Wife's distress, I would have sprung downward to reassure  her, but I found myself incapable of motion.  \"Trouble not yourself  about your Wife,\" said my Guide: \"she will not be long left in anxiety;  meantime, let us take a survey of Flatland.\"    Once more I felt myself rising through space.  It was even as the  Sphere had said.  The further we receded from the object we beheld, the  larger became the field of vision.  My native city, with the interior  of every house and every creature therein, lay open to my view in  miniature.  We mounted higher, and lo, the secrets of the earth, the  depths of the mines and inmost caverns of the hills, were bared before  me.    Awestruck at the sight of the mysteries of the earth, thus unveiled  before my unworthy eye, I said to my Companion, \"Behold, I am become as  a God.  For the wise men in our country say that to see all things, or  as they express it, OMNIVIDENCE, is the attribute of God alone.\" There  was something of scorn in the voice of my Teacher as he made answer:  \"is it so indeed?  Then the very pick-pockets and cut-throats of my  country are to be worshipped by your wise men as being Gods: for there  is not one of them that does not see as much as you see now.  But trust  me, your wise men are wrong.\"    I.  Then is omnividence the attribute of others besides Gods?    Sphere.  I do not know.  But, if a pick-pocket or a cut-throat of our  country can see everything that is in your country, surely that is no  reason why the pick-pocket or cut-throat should be accepted by you as a  God.  This omnividence, as you call it--it is not a common word in  Spaceland--does it make you more just, more merciful, less selfish,  more loving?  Not in the least.  Then how does it make you more divine?    I.  \"More merciful, more loving!\"  But these are the qualities of  women!  And we know that a Circle is a higher Being than a Straight  Line, in so far as knowledge and wisdom are more to be esteemed than  mere affection.    Sphere.  It is not for me to classify human faculties according to  merit.  Yet many of the best and wisest in Spaceland think more of the  affections than of the understanding, more of your despised Straight Lines  than of your belauded Circles.  But enough of this.  Look yonder.  Do  you know that building?    I looked, and afar off I saw an immense Polygonal structure, in which I  recognized the General Assembly Hall of the States of Flatland,  surrounded by dense lines of Pentagonal buildings at right angles to  each other, which I knew to be streets; and I perceived that I was  approaching the great Metropolis.    \"Here "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9791"],[0,"Harrigan (#15)"],[1,"Jerry  Hovey, and had been assigned to a bunk into which he fairly dived and  fell asleep in the posture in which he landed. In the morning he  tumbled out with the other men and became the object of a crossfire of  questions from the curious sailors who wanted to know all the details  of the wreck of the _Mary Rogers_ and the life on the island. He was  saved from answering nine-tenths of the chatter by a signal from the  bos'n, who beckoned Harrigan to a stool a little apart from the rest of  the crew. Jerry Hovey was a cheery fellow of considerable bulk, with an  habitual smile. That smile went out, however, when he talked with  Harrigan, and the Irishman became conscious of a pair of steady, alert  gray eyes.    \"Look here,\" said Hovey, and he talked out of the corner of his mouth  with a skill which would have become an old convict of many terms,  \"I've had it put to me straight that you're a hard one. Is that the  right dope?\"    Harrigan smiled.    \"Because if it is,\" said Hovey, \"we're the best gang at bustin' up  these hard guys that ever walked the deck of a ship. If you try any  side steps and fancy ducking of your work, there'll be a disciplinin'  comin' your way at a gallop. Are you wise?\"    Harrigan still smiled, but the coldness of his eye made the bos'n  thoughtful. He was not one, however, to be easily cowed. Now he balled  his fist and smote it against the palm of his other hand with a slap  that resounded.    \"On my own hook,\" he stated, \"I can sling my mitts with the best of  them, an' I'm always lookin' for work in that line. Now I'm sayin' all  this in private, sonny, to let you know that Black McTee has wised up  the skipper about you, and I'm keepin' a weather eye open. If you make  one funny move, I'll be on your back.\"    \"All right, Jerry.\"    \"Don't call me Jerry, you swab! I'm the bos'n.\"    \"Look me in the eye, Jerry Hovey, me dear. If you so much as bat the  lashes av wan eye in lookin' at me, I'll bust ye in two pieces like a  sea biscuit, Jerry, an' I'll eat the biggest half an' throw the rest  into the sea. Ar-r-re ye wise?\"    Now, Jerry Hovey was a very big man, and he had thrashed men of larger  bulk than Harrigan. But there was something about the Irishman's  thickness of shoulder and length of arm that gave him pause. So first  of all Jerry grew very thoughtful indeed, and then his habitual smile  returned. Nevertheless, Harrigan did not forget those gray, alert eyes.    The bos'n went on in a gentler voice: \"I was tryin' you out, Harrigan.  I'll lay to it that the cap'n has the wrong idea about you. But will  you tell me why he's ridin' you?\"    \"Sure. It's Black McTee. Before the _Mary Rogers_ went down, McTee was  tryin' to break me. I guess he's asked this White Henshaw to try a  hand. What have they got lined up for me?\"    \"You're to scrub down the bridge an' while your hands are still soft  you go down to the fireroom an' pass coal. It'll tear your hands off,  that work.\"    Harrigan was gray, but he answered. \"That's an old story. McTee worked  me like that all the time.\"    \"An' you didn't break?\" gasped Hovey.    Harrigan grinned, but his smile stopped when he noticed a certain  calculation in the face of the bos'n.    \"Mate,\" said Hovey, \"I guess you're about ripe for something I'm goin'  to say to you one of these days. Now go up to the bridge an' scrub it  down.\"    With the prospect of the long torture before him once more, Harrigan in  a daze picked up the bucket of suds to which he was pointed and went  with his brush toward the bridge. Through the mist which enveloped his  brain broke wild thoughts--to steal upon McTee at the first meeting and  hurl his hated body overboard. Yet even in his bewildered condition he  realized what such an act would mean. Murder on land is bad enough, but  murder at sea is doubly damned by the law. It was in the power of White  Henshaw to hang him up to the mast.    Revolving these dismal prospects with downward head, he climbed from  the waist of the ship to the cabin promenade, and there a voice hailed  him, and he turned to see Kate Malone approaching. She was all in  white--cap, canvas shoes, silk shirt absurdly lose at the throat, and  linen coat with the sleeves turned far back so that her hands would not  be enveloped. The duck trousers were also taken up several reefs.    \"Good morning,\" she said, and held out her hand.    He watched her smile wistfully, and then made a little gesture with his  own hands, one burdened with the scrubbing brush and the other with the  bucket.    \"What does it mean?\"    \"Hell,\" said Harrigan.    \"Explain.\"    \"It's McTee again, damn his eyes!\"    \"Do you mean to say they've started to treat you as they did on the  _Mary Rogers_? The scrubbing and then the work in the fireroom?\"    \"Right.\"    She stamped her foot in impotent fury.    \"What manner of man is he, Dan? He's not all brute; why does he treat  you like this?\"    The Irishman smiled.    She cried with increasing anger: \"What can I do?\"    \"Make your skin yellow an' your hair gray an' walk with no spring in  your step. He wants to break me now because of you.\"    There was moist pity in her eyes, yet they gleamed with excitement at  the thought of this battle of the Titans for her sake.    \"I will go to him,\" she said after a moment, \"and tell him that you  mean nothing to me. Then he will stop.\"    The cold, incurious eyes studied her without passion, and once more he  smiled.    \"He'll not stop. Whether you like me or not, Kate, doesn't count. One  of us'll go down, an' you'll be for the one that's left. He knows it--I  know it.\"    \"Harrigan!\" called the voice of McTee from the bridge, and the tall  Scotchman lifted his cap to Kate.    \"I'm the slave,\" said Harrigan, \"and there's the whip. Good-by.\"    She stamped her foot with an almost childish fury, saying: \"Someday he  shall regret this brutal tyranny. Good-by, Dan, and good luck!\"    She took his hand in both of hers, but her eyes held spitefully upon  the bridge, as if she hoped that McTee would witness the handshake; the  captain, however, had turned his back upon them.    Dan muttered to himself as he climbed the bridge: \"Did she do that to  anger McTee or to please me?\" And the thought so occupied his mind that  he paid no attention to the Scotchman when he reached the bridge. He  merely dropped to his knees and commenced scrubbing. McTee, in the  meanwhile, loitered about the bridge as if on his own ship. In due time  Harrigan drew near, the suds swishing under his brush. The Irishman,  remembering suddenly, commenced to hum a tune.    \"The old grind, eh, Harrigan?\" said McTee.    The Irishman, humming idly still, looked up, calmly surveyed the  captain, and then went on as if he had heard merely empty wind instead  of words.    \"After the scrubbing brush the shovel,\" went on McTee, but still  Harrigan paid no attention. He rose when his task was completed and  made his eyes gentle as if with pity while he gazed upon McTee.    \"I'm sorry for you, McTee; you've made a hard fight; it's strange  you've got no ghost of a chance of winnin'.\"    \"What d'you mean?\"    \"Couldn't you hear her when she talked to me?\"    \"I could not.\"    \"Couldn't you see her face? It was written there as plain as print.\"    McTee cleared his throat.    \"What was written there?\"    \"The thing you want to see. When she took my hand in both of hers--\"    \"Hell!\"    \"Ah-h, man, it was wonderful! The scrubbing brush an' the shovel--they  mean nothin' to me now.\"    \"Harrigan, you're lying.\"    The latter dropped his scrubbing brush into the bucket of suds and  stood with arms akimbo studying the captain.    \"For a smart man, McTee, you've been a fool. I could of gone down on me  knees an' begged to do what you've done. Don't you see? You've thrown  her with her will or against it into me arms. I'm poor Harrigan, brave  and downtrodden; you're Black McTee once more, the tyrant. She looks  sick at the mention of your name.\"    \"I never dreamed you'd go whining to her. I thought you were a man;  you're only a spineless dog, Harrigan!\"    \"Am I that? She pities me, McTee, an' from pity it's only one step to  something bigger. Can you trust me to lead her that one step? You can!\"    \"If I went to her and told her how you boasted of having won her?\"    \"She wouldn't believe what you said about me if you swore it with both  hands on the Bible. Be wise, McTee. Give up the game. You've lost her,  me boy! For every day that I work in the fireroom I'll come to her an'  show her the palms of me bleedin' hands an' mention your name. An' for  every day I work in the hole the hate of you will burn blacker into her  heart.\"    \"I'd rather have her hate than her pity.\"    \"You'll have both; her hate for torturin' Harrigan; her pity for  lettin' the devil in you get the best of the man. You're done for,  McTee.\"    Each one of the short phrases was like a whip flicked across the face  of McTee, but he would not wince.    \"You've said enough. Now get down to the fireroom. I've had Henshaw  prepare the chief engineer for your coming.\"    Harrigan turned.    \"Wait! Remember when you're in hell that the old compact still holds.  Your hand in mine and a promise to be my man will end the war.\"    Only the low laughter of the Irishman answered as he made his way down  to the deck.          CHAPTER 18      \"There's times for truth an' there's times for lying,\" murmured  Harrigan, as he stowed away the bucket and brush and started down for  the fireroom, \"an' this was one of the times for lyin'. He's sick for  the love of her, an' he's hatin' the thought of Harrigan.\"    So he was humming a rollicking tune when he reached the fireroom. It  was stifling hot, to be sure, but it was twice as large as that of the  Mary Rogers. The firemen were all glistening with sweat. One of them,  larger than the rest and with a bristling, shoebrush mustache like a  sign of authority, said to the newcomer: \"You're Harrigan?\"    He"]]]
