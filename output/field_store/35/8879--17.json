Upon reaching the  house of the hostess for the evening, he must escort his fair  charge to the dressing-room, leave her at the door, make his own  toilet as rapidly as possibly, and return to meet the lady at the  dressing-room door again, escort her to the ball-room, and at once  to the hostess. She is obliged by etiquette to dance the first  dance with him; but after that, he may with propriety allow her  liberty to select other partners, always watching, however, to see  that she is never neglected. He must be her escort to supper, and  ready at any moment to leave the ball-room to escort her home  again.    If a gentleman is unaccompanied by a lady, he must invite one of  the ladies of the house for the first dance, and yield gracefully  if she declines on the plea of want of room or partners for all  her guests, consenting smilingly if she requests him to lead out  the homeliest and most awkward of her wall-flowers.    The music must be first a march, then a quadrille, a polka, a  waltz, a galop, and so on, with two or three round dances to each  quadrille, until fourteen dances are completed, when another march  announces supper. Seven to ten dances may follow supper. Each  guest must be provided with a ball-card with a printed programme  of the dances, and space for the engagements upon it, and a tiny  pencil attached to it. Many ladies carry their own engagement-  card; but they must depend upon the programme for the order of  dances. The fashion of hanging a few printed programmes in the  room is not considered _en regle_.    The supper-room must be thrown open at midnight, and remain open  until the ball closes. It is, however, an extreme of bad taste and  low breeding for gentlemen to cluster round the table in groups  and remain there. It is one of the duties of the hostess to see  that no young lady loses her supper for want of an escort to the  slipper-room. If there are no young gentlemen in the family, she  must request one of her guests to go to the rescue of the forlorn  maiden.    No gentleman must wait until the music has commenced before  selecting his partner.    A lady who declines dancing on the pretext of fatigue must dance  no more, unless she has said she wished to rest for that dance  alone.    If a lady decline dancing with a gentlemen, it is rude for him to  turn from her to another lady who has heard the refusal, and  invite her to dance. If the first lady has a prior engagement, he  must seek another partner in another part of the room; if she  refuses from fatigue or a disinclination to dance that set, it is  a compliment to her for him to remain beside her, and endeavor to  entertain her while the dance is in progress.    A lady should never give her bouquet, gloves, and fan to a  gentleman to hold during a dance, unless he is her husband,  brother, or escort for the evening.    A gentleman, in waltzing with a young lady, must never encircle  her waist until the dance actually commences, and drop his arm  from around her as soon as the music ceases. American gentlemen  would do well to study the waltz with a German teacher, as they  understand more perfectly than any others the most delicate way of  dancing this objectionable dance, and, above all, how to hold a  lady lightly and firmly without embracing her.    When a lady expresses a desire to sit down before the close of a  dance, it is exceedingly rude for a gentlemen to insist upon a  continuation of the dance. He must escort her to a seat at once,  and then express his regret at the interrupted pleasure. She may  with propriety release him to seek another partner, but it is a  poor compliment for him to accept the proposal.    A gentleman should never invite a lady to be his partner in a  dance with which he is not perfectly familiar. It is tiresome in  the extreme to guide a partner through a dance, and the ballroom  is not a dancing-school for practice.    If a gentleman takes a lady's seat during a dance, he must rise  from it as soon as the dance is over, not waiting for her to  actually return to it, as she may hesitate to do if she sees that  it is occupied.    No lady must enter or cross a ball-room unescorted.    No lady may refuse to be introduced to a gentleman at a private  ball; but at a public ball she may with perfect propriety refuse  any introduction made by the master of ceremonies, or by mere  acquaintances.    Confidential conversation in a ball-room is in extreme bad taste.    Do not be too particular about dancing. Taking steps in a  quadrille is out of date, all the figures being executed to a  graceful walk.    To remain too late at a ball is not well-bred, and seems to imply  that you are unaccustomed to such pleasures. Do not engage  yourself, therefore, for the last two or three dances.    No gentleman should take the vacant seat next to a lady unless he  is acquainted with her, and not then without first asking  permission.    A gentleman must offer his arm, never his hand, to lead a lady to  and from the dance.    A lady must be very careful not to engage herself to two gentlemen  for the same dance, unless, for a round dance, she states: \"I am  engaged for the first half of the waltz, but will dance the second  part with you.\" In that case, she must tell her first partner of  her second engagement, that she may not offend him when she takes  another partner after leaving him.    If a lady wishes to decline dancing, whether from dislike to the  gentleman who invites her, or from whatever cause, she must make  some excuse; but she must never refuse point blank, nor must she,  after having refused to dance with one gentleman, consent to dance  with another.    When introduced, it is sufficient for a gentleman to say to a  lady, \"May I have the pleasure of dancing this waltz with you,  Miss C---?\" or if the lady be engaged for the first dance  following the introduction, he may request the favor of putting  his name upon her engagement card for another.    A young lady should not dance more than twice with the same  gentleman, unless she wants to be noticed, or is indifferent  whether she be so or not.    A lady may consult her own pleasure about recognizing a ballroom  acquaintance at a future meeting.    Every gentleman must make a point of inviting the ladies of the  house to dance; and if he be kind, he will certainly devote  himself--for a portion of the evening, at least--to those ladies  for whom the May of life has bloomed and passed away, and who  generally sit round the room looking wistfully disconsolate.    After every dance following the announcement of supper, offer your  partner your arm, and invite her to the supper-room (at a ball,  refreshments are never handed round). Should she decline going, or  has already been there, take her back to her chaperon, or party,  and, procuring a seat for her, thank her for the pleasure the  dance has afforded you.    No lady should detain her partner long in the supper-room; she may  be thus forcing him to be guilty of the rudeness of breaking an  engagement with another lady for the following dance.    No gentleman should linger round the supper-table. Your hostess  invites you to a ball to dance, and be agreeable, not to haunt her  supper-room, as if you were starving.    Avoid all absence of mind, staring, listlessness, and other  eccentricities.    Never swing your arms about, and try to avoid being conspicuous in  any way.    Take the partner with whom you may happen to be dancing when  supper is announced to the supper-table, unless she has come with  a gentleman, in which case you must not usurp his privilege. If  she is disengaged, escort her to a seat in the supper-room, if  possible, and see that she is served with the dishes she selects.  Do not take your own supper at the same time; wait till the lady  has finished; then take her back to the ball-room, and repeat the  process, if necessary, with some other lonely damsel. When all the  ladies have been once to the supper-room, the gentlemen may think  of their own supper.    Gloves of white kid must be worn during the entire evening, and it  is well to have a fresh pair in readiness to put on after supper.    On quitting a ball, it is not necessary to take a formal leave of  the hostess. Indeed, it is preferable to make your departure as  quietly as possible, in order to prevent the others from thinking  it later than perhaps it is, and so breaking up the ball at an  earlier hour than the hostess may desire.    If a gentleman escorts a lady home from a ball, she is not obliged  to invite him to enter, and if she does so, he must decline the  invitation. He must, however, request permission to call the  following day or evening, and he must make that call.    A gentleman in a ball-room cannot be too careful not to injure the  delicate fabric worn by the ladies around him. Spurs are in bad  taste, even if a cavalry officer is otherwise in full uniform.    While one dance is in progress, it is not in good taste to make  arrangements for another.    It is a gross breach of etiquette on the part of either a lady or  a gentleman to forget a ball-room engagement.    It is not according, to etiquette for married people to dance  together at either a private or a public ball.      MORNING AND EVENING PARTIES.    PARTIES in the city comprise conversaziones, private concerts,  private theatricals, soirees, dramatic readings, tea-parties,  matinees--fact, almost any in-door gathering together of people,  exclusive of balls and dinner companies. In the country, small  dancing-parties, tea-parties, and conversaziones are also  comprised under the head of parties; but the outdoor occasions are  of much greater number and variety: croquet parties, sailing  parties, boating parties, pic-nics, private fetes, berrying  parties, nutting parties, May festivals, Fourth of July festivals  --in fact,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],[0,"The King in Yellow (#15)"],[1,"silent as long as I was on the drawing, but as soon as the  scrape of the charcoal ceased and I took up my fixative she began to  chatter.    \"Oh, I had such a lovely time last night. We went to Tony Pastor's.\"    \"Who are 'we'?\" I demanded.    \"Oh, Maggie, you know, Mr. Whyte's model, and Pinkie McCormick--we call  her Pinkie because she's got that beautiful red hair you artists like so  much--and Lizzie Burke.\"    I sent a shower of spray from the fixative over the canvas, and said:  \"Well, go on.\"    \"We saw Kelly and Baby Barnes the skirt-dancer and--and all the rest. I  made a mash.\"    \"Then you have gone back on me, Tessie?\"    She laughed and shook her head.    \"He's Lizzie Burke's brother, Ed. He's a perfect gen'l'man.\"    I felt constrained to give her some parental advice concerning mashing,  which she took with a bright smile.    \"Oh, I can take care of a strange mash,\" she said, examining her chewing  gum, \"but Ed is different. Lizzie is my best friend.\"    Then she related how Ed had come back from the stocking mill in Lowell,  Massachusetts, to find her and Lizzie grown up, and what an accomplished  young man he was, and how he thought nothing of squandering half-a-dollar  for ice-cream and oysters to celebrate his entry as clerk into the  woollen department of Macy's. Before she finished I began to paint, and  she resumed the pose, smiling and chattering like a sparrow. By noon I  had the study fairly well rubbed in and Tessie came to look at it.    \"That's better,\" she said.    I thought so too, and ate my lunch with a satisfied feeling that all was  going well. Tessie spread her lunch on a drawing table opposite me and we  drank our claret from the same bottle and lighted our cigarettes from the  same match. I was very much attached to Tessie. I had watched her shoot  up into a slender but exquisitely formed woman from a frail, awkward  child. She had posed for me during the last three years, and among all my  models she was my favourite. It would have troubled me very much indeed  had she become \"tough\" or \"fly,\" as the phrase goes, but I never noticed  any deterioration of her manner, and felt at heart that she was all  right. She and I never discussed morals at all, and I had no intention of  doing so, partly because I had none myself, and partly because I knew she  would do what she liked in spite of me. Still I did hope she would steer  clear of complications, because I wished her well, and then also I had a  selfish desire to retain the best model I had. I knew that mashing, as  she termed it, had no significance with girls like Tessie, and that such  things in America did not resemble in the least the same things in Paris.  Yet, having lived with my eyes open, I also knew that somebody would take  Tessie away some day, in one manner or another, and though I professed to  myself that marriage was nonsense, I sincerely hoped that, in this case,  there would be a priest at the end of the vista. I am a Catholic. When I  listen to high mass, when I sign myself, I feel that everything,  including myself, is more cheerful, and when I confess, it does me good.  A man who lives as much alone as I do, must confess to somebody. Then,  again, Sylvia was Catholic, and it was reason enough for me. But I was  speaking of Tessie, which is very different. Tessie also was Catholic and  much more devout than I, so, taking it all in all, I had little fear for  my pretty model until she should fall in love. But _then_ I knew  that fate alone would decide her future for her, and I prayed inwardly  that fate would keep her away from men like me and throw into her path  nothing but Ed Burkes and Jimmy McCormicks, bless her sweet face!    Tessie sat blowing rings of smoke up to the ceiling and tinkling the ice  in her tumbler.    \"Do you know that I also had a dream last night?\" I observed.    \"Not about that man,\" she laughed.    \"Exactly. A dream similar to yours, only much worse.\"    It was foolish and thoughtless of me to say this, but you know how little  tact the average painter has. \"I must have fallen asleep about ten  o'clock,\" I continued, \"and after a while I dreamt that I awoke. So  plainly did I hear the midnight bells, the wind in the tree-branches, and  the whistle of steamers from the bay, that even now I can scarcely  believe I was not awake. I seemed to be lying in a box which had a glass  cover. Dimly I saw the street lamps as I passed, for I must tell you,  Tessie, the box in which I reclined appeared to lie in a cushioned wagon  which jolted me over a stony pavement. After a while I became impatient  and tried to move, but the box was too narrow. My hands were crossed on  my breast, so I could not raise them to help myself. I listened and then  tried to call. My voice was gone. I could hear the trample of the horses  attached to the wagon, and even the breathing of the driver. Then another  sound broke upon my ears like the raising of a window sash. I managed to  turn my head a little, and found I could look, not only through the glass  cover of my box, but also through the glass panes in the side of the  covered vehicle. I saw houses, empty and silent, with neither light nor  life about any of them excepting one. In that house a window was open on  the first floor, and a figure all in white stood looking down into the  street. It was you.\"    Tessie had turned her face away from me and leaned on the table with her  elbow.    \"I could see your face,\" I resumed, \"and it seemed to me to be very  sorrowful. Then we passed on and turned into a narrow black lane.  Presently the horses stopped. I waited and waited, closing my eyes with  ear and impatience, but all was silent as the grave. After what seemed to  me hours, I began to feel uncomfortable. A sense that somebody was close  to me made me unclose my eyes. Then I saw the white face of the  hearse-driver looking at me through the coffin-lid----\"    A sob from Tessie interrupted me. She was trembling like a leaf. I saw I  had made an ass of myself and attempted to repair the damage.    \"Why, Tess,\" I said, \"I only told you this to show you what influence  your story might have on another person's dreams. You don't suppose I  really lay in a coffin, do you? What are you trembling for? Don't you see  that your dream and my unreasonable dislike for that inoffensive watchman  of the church simply set my brain working as soon as I fell asleep?\"    She laid her head between her arms, and sobbed as if her heart would  break. What a precious triple donkey I had made of myself! But I was  about to break my record. I went over and put my arm about her.    \"Tessie dear, forgive me,\" I said; \"I had no business to frighten you  with such nonsense. You are too sensible a girl, too good a Catholic to  believe in dreams.\"    Her hand tightened on mine and her head fell back upon my shoulder, but  she still trembled and I petted her and comforted her.    \"Come, Tess, open your eyes and smile.\"    Her eyes opened with a slow languid movement and met mine, but their  expression was so queer that I hastened to reassure her again.    \"It's all humbug, Tessie; you surely are not afraid that any harm will  come to you because of that.\"    \"No,\" she said, but her scarlet lips quivered.    \"Then, what's the matter? Are you afraid?\"    \"Yes. Not for myself.\"    \"For me, then?\" I demanded gaily.    \"For you,\" she murmured in a voice almost inaudible. \"I--I care for you.\"    At first I started to laugh, but when I understood her, a shock passed  through me, and I sat like one turned to stone. This was the crowning bit  of idiocy I had committed. During the moment which elapsed between her  reply and my answer I thought of a thousand responses to that innocent  confession. I could pass it by with a laugh, I could misunderstand her  and assure her as to my health, I could simply point out that it was  impossible she could love me. But my reply was quicker than my thoughts,  and I might think and think now when it was too late, for I had kissed  her on the mouth.    That evening I took my usual walk in Washington Park, pondering over the  occurrences of the day. I was thoroughly committed. There was no back out  now, and I stared the future straight in the face. I was not good, not  even scrupulous, but I had no idea of deceiving either myself or Tessie.  The one passion of my life lay buried in the sunlit forests of Brittany.  Was it buried for ever? Hope cried \"No!\" For three years I had been  listening to the voice of Hope, and for three years I had waited for a  footstep on my threshold. Had Sylvia forgotten? \"No!\" cried Hope.    I said that I was no good. That is true, but still I was not exactly a  comic opera villain. I had led an easy-going reckless life, taking what  invited me of pleasure, deploring and sometimes bitterly regretting  consequences. In one thing alone, except my painting, was I serious, and  that was something which lay hidden if not lost in the Breton forests.    It was too late for me to regret what had occurred during the day.  Whatever it had been, pity, a sudden tenderness for sorrow, or the more  brutal instinct of gratified vanity, it was all the same now, and unless  I wished to bruise an innocent heart, my path lay marked before me. The  fire and strength, the depth of passion of a love which I had never even  suspected, with all my imagined experience in the world, left me no  alternative but to respond or send her away. Whether because I am so  cowardly about giving pain to others, or whether it was that I have  little of the gloomy Puritan in me, I do not know, but I shrank from  disclaiming responsibility for that thoughtless kiss, and in fact had no  time to do so before the gates of her heart opened and the flood poured  forth. Others who habitually do their duty and find a sullen satisfaction  in making themselves and everybody else unhappy, might have withstood it.  I did not. I dared not. After the storm had abated I did "]]]
