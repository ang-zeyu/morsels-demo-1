Having been  purchased of Count Fede by Pius VI, they were placed in the Museum of  the Vatican.      105. ANTINOÜS.    This bust is particularly deserving of attention, on account of its  beauty, its excellent preservation, and perfect resemblance to the  medals which remain of Adrian's favourite.    It is of Parian marble of the finest quality, and had been in France  long before the revolution.      112. ARIADNE, _called_ (in the catalogue) BACCHUS.    Some sculptors have determined to call this beautiful head that of  BACCHUS; while the celebrated VISCONTI, and other distinguished  antiquaries, persist in preserving to it its ancient name of ARIADNE,  by which it was known in the Museum of the Capitol.    Whichever it may be, it is of Pentelic marble, and unquestionably one  of the most sublime productions of the chisel, in point of _ideal_  beauty.           *       *       *       *       *    From the HALL OF THE LAOCOON, we pass into the apartment, which, from  the famous statue, here erected, and embellished in the most splendid  manner, takes the appellation of the    HALL OF THE APOLLO.    This hall is ornamented with four pillars of red oriental granite of  the finest quality: those which decorate the niche of the Apollo were  taken from the church that contained the tomb of Charlemagne at  _Aix-la-Chapelle_. The floor is paved with different species of  scarce and valuable marble, in large compartments, and, in its  centre, is placed a large octagonal table of the same substance.    In proportion to the dimensions of this apartment, which is  considerably larger than any of the others, a greater number of  antiques are here placed, of which the following are the most  pre-eminent.      N° 145. APOLLO PYTHIUS, _commonly called the_ APOLLO OF BELVEDERE.    The name alone of this _chef d'oeuvre_ might be said to contain its  eulogium. But as you may, probably, expect from me some remarks on  it, I shall candidly acknowledge that I can do no better than  communicate to you the able and interesting description given of it  by the Administration of the Museum, of which the following is a fair  abridgment.    \"Apollo has just discharged the mortal arrow which has struck the  serpent Python, while ravaging Delphi. In his left hand is held his  formidable bow; his right has but an instant quitted it: all his  members still preserve the impression given them by this action.  Indignation is seated on his lips; but in his looks is the assurance  of success. His hair, slightly curled, floats in long ringlets round  his neck, or is gracefully turned up on the crown of his head, which  is encircled by the _strophium_, or fillet, characteristic of kings  and gods. His quiver is suspended by a belt to the right shoulder:  his feet are adorned with rich sandals. His _chlamis_ fastened on the  shoulder, and tucked up only on the left arm, is thrown back, as if  to display the majesty of his divine form to greater advantage.    \"An eternal youth is spread over all his beautiful figure, a sublime  mixture of nobleness and agility, of vigour and elegance, and which  holds a happy medium between the delicate form of Bacchus, and the  more manly one of Mercury.\"    This inimitable master-piece is of Carrara marble, and, consequently,  was executed by some Greek artist who lived in the time of the  Romans; but the name of its author is entirely unknown. The fore-arm  and the left hand, which were wanting, were restored by GIOVANNI  ANGELO DE MONTORSOLI, a sculptor, who was a pupil of Michael Angelo.    Towards the end of the fifteenth century, it was discovered at _Capo  d'Anzo_, twelve leagues from Rome, on the sea-shore, near the ruins  of the ancient _Antium_. Julius II, when cardinal, purchased this  statue, and placed it in his palace; but shortly after, having  arrived at the pontificate, he had it conveyed to the Belvedere of  the Vatican, where, for three centuries, it was the admiration of the  world.    On the 16th of Brumaire, year IX, (7th of November, 1801) BONAPARTE,  as First Consul, celebrated, in great pomp, the inauguration of the  Apollo; on which occasion he placed between the plinth of the statue,  and its pedestal, a brass tablet bearing a suitable inscription.    The Apollo stands facing the entrance-door of the apartment, in an  elevated recess, decorated, as I have before observed, with beautiful  granite pillars. The flight of steps, leading to this recess, is  paved with the rarest marble, inlaid with squares of curious antique  mosaic, and on them are placed two Egyptian sphynxes of red oriental  granite, taken from the Museum of the Vatican.      142. VENUS OF THE CAPITOL.    This figure of Parian marble represents the goddess of beauty issuing  from the bath. Her charms are not concealed by any veil or garment.  She is slightly turning her head to the left, as if to smile on the  Graces, who are supposed to be preparing to attire her.    In point of execution, this is allowed to be the most beautiful of  all the statues of Venus which we have remaining. The _Venus of  Medicis_ surpasses it in sublimity of form, approaching nearer to  _ideal_ beauty.    Bupalus, a sculptor of the Isle of Scio, is said to have produced  this master-piece. He lived 600 years before Christ, so that it has  now been in existence upwards of two thousand four hundred years. It  was found about the middle of the eighteenth century, near  _San-Vitale_, at Rome. Benedict XIV having purchased it of the  _Stati_ family, placed it in the Capitol.      125. MERCURY, _commonly called the_ ANTINOÜS OF BELVEDERE.    This statue, also of the finest Parian marble, is one of the most  beautiful that can be imagined. More robust in form than either that  of the _Apollo_ or of the _Meleager_, it loses nothing by being  contemplated after the former. In short, the harmony which reigns  between its parts is such, that the celebrated POUSSIN, in preference  to every other, always took from it the _proportions of the human  figure_.    It was found at Rome, on Mount Esquiline, under the pontificate of  Paul III, who placed it in the Belvedere of the Vatican, near the  Apollo and the Laocoon.      151. _The Egyptian_ ANTINOÜS.    In this statue, Antinoüs is represented as a divinity of Egypt. He is  standing in the usual attitude of the Egyptian gods, and is naked,  with the exception of his head and wrist, which are covered with a  species of drapery in imitation of the sacred garments.    This beautiful figure is wrought with superior excellence. It is of  white marble, which leads to a conjecture that it might have been  intended to represent Orus, the god of light, it having been the  custom of the Egyptians to represent all their other divinities in  coloured marble. It was discovered in 1738, at Tivoli, in the  _Villa-Adriana_, and taken from the Museum of the Capitol.    To judge from the great number of figures of Antinoüs, sculptured by  order of Adrian to perpetuate the memory of that favourite, the  emperor's gratitude for him must have been unbounded. Under the form  of different divinities, or at different periods of life, there are  at present in the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES no less than five portraits of  him, besides three statues and two busts. Three other statues of  Antinoüs, together with a bust, and an excellent bass-relief, in  which he is represented, yet remain to be placed.      156. BACCHUS.    The god of wine is here represented standing, and entirely naked. He  is leaning carelessly with his left arm on the trunk of an elm, round  which winds a grape-vine.    This statue, of the marble called at Rome _Greco duro_, is reckoned  one of the finest extant of the mirth-inspiring deity.           *       *       *       *       *    Having surveyed every object deserving of notice in the HALL OF THE  APOLLO, we proceed, on the right hand, towards its extremity, and  reach the last apartment of the gallery, which, from being  consecrated to the tuneful Nine, is called the    HALL OF THE MUSES.    It is paved with curious marble, and independently of the Muses, and  their leader, Apollo, here are also assembled the antique portraits  of poets and philosophers who have rendered themselves famous by  cultivating them. Among these we may perceive HOMER and VIRGIL; but  the most remarkable specimen of the art is      N° 177. EURIPIDES.    In this hermes we have a capital representation of the features of  the rival of Sophocles. The countenance is at once noble, serious,  and expressive. It bears the stamp of the genius of that celebrated  tragic poet, which was naturally sublime and profound, though  inclined to the pathetic.    This hermes is executed in Pentelic marble, and was taken from the  academy of _Mantua_.    Since the revival of the arts, the lovers of antiquity have made  repeated attempts to form a collection of antique statues of the  Muses; but none was ever so complete as that assembled in the Museum  of the Vatican by Pius VI, and which the chance of war has now  transferred to the banks of the Seine. Here the bard may offer up to  them a solemn invocation, and compose his lay, as it were, under  their very eyes.    The statues of CLIO, THALIA, TERPSICHORE, ERATO, POLYHYMNIA, and  CALLIOPE, together with the APOLLO MUSAGETES, were discovered in  1774, at _Tivoli_, among the ruins of the villa of Cassius. To  complete the number, Pius VI obtained the EUTERPE and the URANIA from  the _Lancellotti_ palace at _Veletri_. They are supposed to be  antique copies of the statues of the Nine Muses by Philiscus, which,  according to Pliny, graced the portico of Octavia.           *       *       *       *       *    The air of grandeur that reigns in the general arrangement of the  gallery is very striking: and the tasteful and judicious distribution  of this matchless assemblage of antiques does great honour to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#15)"],[1,"girl  played she prattled continuously to her companion, propped in a sitting  position with a couple of twigs.  She was totally absorbed in the  domestic duties of Geeka--so much so that she did not note the gentle  swaying of the branches of the tree above her as they bent to the body  of the creature that had entered them stealthily from the jungle.    In happy ignorance the little girl played on, while from above two  steady eyes looked down upon her--unblinking, unwavering.  There was  none other than the little girl in this part of the village, which had  been almost deserted since The Sheik had left long months before upon  his journey toward the north.    And out in the jungle, an hour's march from the village, The Sheik was  leading his returning caravan homeward.      A year had passed since the white men had fired upon the lad and driven  him back into the jungle to take up his search for the only remaining  creatures to whom he might look for companionship--the great apes.  For  months the two had wandered eastward, deeper and deeper into the  jungle.  The year had done much for the boy--turning his already mighty  muscles to thews of steel, developing his woodcraft to a point where it  verged upon the uncanny, perfecting his arboreal instincts, and  training him in the use of both natural and artificial weapons.    He had become at last a creature of marvelous physical powers and  mental cunning.  He was still but a boy, yet so great was his strength  that the powerful anthropoid with which he often engaged in mimic  battle was no match for him.  Akut had taught him to fight as the bull  ape fights, nor ever was there a teacher better fitted to instruct in  the savage warfare of primordial man, or a pupil better equipped to  profit by the lessons of a master.    As the two searched for a band of the almost extinct species of ape to  which Akut belonged they lived upon the best the jungle afforded.  Antelope and zebra fell to the boy's spear, or were dragged down by the  two powerful beasts of prey who leaped upon them from some overhanging  limb or from the ambush of the undergrowth beside the trail to the  water hole or the ford.    The pelt of a leopard covered the nakedness of the youth; but the  wearing of it had not been dictated by any prompting of modesty.  With  the rifle shots of the white men showering about him he had reverted to  the savagery of the beast that is inherent in each of us, but that  flamed more strongly in this boy whose father had been raised a beast  of prey.  He wore his leopard skin at first in response to a desire to  parade a trophy of his prowess, for he had slain the leopard with his  knife in a hand-to-hand combat.  He saw that the skin was beautiful,  which appealed to his barbaric sense of ornamentation, and when it  stiffened and later commenced to decompose because of his having no  knowledge of how to cure or tan it was  with sorrow and regret that he  discarded it.  Later, when he chanced upon a lone, black warrior  wearing the counterpart of it, soft and clinging and beautiful from  proper curing, it required but an instant to leap from above upon the  shoulders of the unsuspecting black, sink a keen blade into his heart  and possess the rightly preserved hide.    There were no after-qualms of conscience.  In the jungle might is  right, nor does it take long to inculcate this axiom in the mind of a  jungle dweller, regardless of what his past training may have been.  That the black would have killed him had he had the chance the boy knew  full well.  Neither he nor the black were any more sacred than the  lion, or the buffalo, the zebra or the deer, or any other of the  countless creatures who roamed, or slunk, or flew, or wriggled through  the dark mazes of the forest.  Each had but a single life, which was  sought by many.  The greater number of enemies slain the better chance  to prolong that life.  So the boy smiled and donned the finery of the  vanquished, and went his way with Akut, searching, always searching for  the elusive anthropoids who were to welcome them with open arms.  And  at last they found them.  Deep in the jungle, buried far from sight of  man, they came upon such another little natural arena as had witnessed  the wild ceremony of the Dum-Dum in which the boy's father had taken  part long years before.    First, at a great distance, they heard the beating of the drum of the  great apes.  They were sleeping in the safety of a huge tree when the  booming sound smote upon their ears.  Both awoke at once.  Akut was the  first to interpret the strange cadence.    \"The great apes!\" he growled.  \"They dance the Dum-Dum.  Come, Korak,  son of Tarzan, let us go to our people.\"    Months before Akut had given the boy a name of his own choosing, since  he could not master the man given name of Jack.  Korak is as near as it  may be interpreted into human speech.  In the language of the apes it  means Killer.  Now the Killer rose upon the branch of the great tree  where he had been sleeping with his back braced against the stem.  He  stretched his lithe young muscles, the moonlight filtering through the  foliage from above dappling his brown skin with little patches of light.    The ape, too, stood up, half squatting after the manner of his kind.  Low growls rumbled from the bottom of his deep chest--growls of excited  anticipation.  The boy growled in harmony with the ape.  Then the  anthropoid slid softly to the ground.  Close by, in the direction of  the booming drum, lay a clearing which they must cross.  The moon  flooded it with silvery light.  Half-erect, the great ape shuffled into  the full glare of the moon.  At his side, swinging gracefully along in  marked contrast to the awkwardness of his companion, strode the boy,  the dark, shaggy coat of the one brushing against the smooth, clear  hide of the other.  The lad was humming now, a music hall air that had  found its way to the forms of the great English public school that was  to see him no more.  He was happy and expectant.  The moment he had  looked forward to for so long was about to be realized.  He was coming  into his own.  He was coming home.  As the months had dragged or flown  along, retarded or spurred on as privation or adventure predominated,  thoughts of his own home, while oft recurring, had become less vivid.  The old life had grown to seem more like a dream than a reality, and  the balking of his determination to reach the coast and return to  London had finally thrown the hope of realization so remotely into the  future that it too now seemed little more than a pleasant but hopeless  dream.    Now all thoughts of London and civilization were crowded so far into  the background of his brain that they might as well have been  non-existent.  Except for form and mental development he was as much an  ape as the great, fierce creature at his side.    In the exuberance of his joy he slapped his companion roughly on the  side of the head.  Half in anger, half in play the anthropoid turned  upon him, his fangs bared and glistening.  Long, hairy arms reached out  to seize him, and, as they had done a thousand times before, the two  clinched in mimic battle, rolling upon the sward, striking, growling  and biting, though never closing their teeth in more than a rough  pinch.  It was wondrous practice for them both.  The boy brought into  play wrestling tricks that he had learned at school, and many of these  Akut learned to use and to foil.  And from the ape the boy learned the  methods that had been handed down to Akut from some common ancestor of  them both, who had roamed the teeming earth when ferns were trees and  crocodiles were birds.    But there was one art the boy possessed which Akut could not master,  though he did achieve fair proficiency in it for an ape--boxing.  To  have his bull-like charges stopped and crumpled with a suddenly planted  fist upon the end of his snout, or a painful jolt in the short ribs,  always surprised Akut.  It angered him too, and at such times his  mighty jaws came nearer to closing in the soft flesh of his friend than  at any other, for he was still an ape, with an ape's short temper and  brutal instincts; but the difficulty was in catching his tormentor  while his rage lasted, for when he lost his head and rushed madly into  close quarters with the boy he discovered that the stinging hail of  blows released upon him always found their mark and effectually stopped  him--effectually and painfully.  Then he would withdraw growling  viciously, backing away with grinning jaws distended, to sulk for an  hour or so.    Tonight they did not box.  Just for a moment or two they wrestled  playfully, until the scent of Sheeta, the panther, brought them to  their feet, alert and wary.  The great cat was passing through the  jungle in front of them.  For a moment it paused, listening.  The boy  and the ape growled menacingly in chorus and the carnivore moved on.    Then the two took up their journey toward the sound of the Dum-Dum.  Louder and louder came the beating of the drum.  Now, at last, they  could hear the growling of the dancing apes, and strong to their  nostrils came the scent of their kind.  The lad trembled with  excitement.  The hair down Akut's spine stiffened--the symptoms of  happiness and anger are often similar.    Silently they crept through the jungle as they neared the meeting place  of the apes.  Now they were in the trees, worming their way forward,  alert for sentinels.  Presently through a break in the foliage the  scene burst upon the eager eyes of the boy.  To Akut it was a familiar  one; but to Korak it was all new.  His nerves tingled at the savage  sight.  The great bulls were dancing in the moonlight, leaping in an  irregular circle about the flat-topped earthen drum about which three  old females sat beating its resounding top with sticks worn smooth by  long years of use.    Akut, knowing the temper and customs "]]]
