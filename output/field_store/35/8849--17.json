In  this I am attempting to carry on the traditions of my country. So  far back as twenty-five centuries, India welcomed to its ancient  universities, at Nalanda and Taxila, scholars from all parts of  the world.    \"Although science is neither of the East nor of the West but rather  international in its universality, yet India is specially fitted to  make great contributions. {FN8-5} The burning Indian imagination,  which can extort new order out of a mass of apparently contradictory  facts, is held in check by the habit of concentration. This restraint  confers the power to hold the mind to the pursuit of truth with an  infinite patience.\"    Tears stood in my eyes at the scientist's concluding words. Is  \"patience\" not indeed a synonym of India, confounding Time and the  historians alike?    I visited the research center again, soon after the day of opening.  The great botanist, mindful of his promise, took me to his quiet  laboratory.    \"I will attach the crescograph to this fern; the magnification is  tremendous. If a snail's crawl were enlarged in the same proportion,  the creature would appear to be traveling like an express train!\"    My gaze was fixed eagerly on the screen which reflected the magnified  fern-shadow. Minute life-movements were now clearly perceptible;  the plant was growing very slowly before my fascinated eyes. The  scientist touched the tip of the fern with a small metal bar. The  developing pantomime came to an abrupt halt, resuming the eloquent  rhythms as soon as the rod was withdrawn.    \"You saw how any slight outside interference is detrimental to the  sensitive tissues,\" Bose remarked. \"Watch; I will now administer  chloroform, and then give an antidote.\"    The effect of the chloroform discontinued all growth; the antidote  was revivifying. The evolutionary gestures on the screen held me  more raptly than a \"movie\" plot. My companion (here in the role  of villain) thrust a sharp instrument through a part of the fern;  pain was indicated by spasmodic flutters. When he passed a razor  partially through the stem, the shadow was violently agitated, then  stilled itself with the final punctuation of death.    \"By first chloroforming a huge tree, I achieved a successful  transplantation. Usually, such monarchs of the forest die very  quickly after being moved.\" Jagadis smiled happily as he recounted  the life-saving maneuver. \"Graphs of my delicate apparatus have  proved that trees possess a circulatory system; their sap movements  correspond to the blood pressure of animal bodies. The ascent of  sap is not explicable on the mechanical grounds ordinarily advanced,  such as capillary attraction. The phenomenon has been solved through  the crescograph as the activity of living cells. Peristaltic waves  issue from a cylindrical tube which extends down a tree and serves  as an actual heart! The more deeply we perceive, the more striking  becomes the evidence that a uniform plan links every form in manifold  nature.\"    The great scientist pointed to another Bose instrument.    \"I will show you experiments on a piece of tin. The life-force in  metals responds adversely or beneficially to stimuli. Ink markings  will register the various reactions.\"    Deeply engrossed, I watched the graph which recorded the characteristic  waves of atomic structure. When the professor applied chloroform  to the tin, the vibratory writings stopped. They recommenced as  the metal slowly regained its normal state. My companion dispensed  a poisonous chemical. Simultaneous with the quivering end of the  tin, the needle dramatically wrote on the chart a death-notice.    \"Bose instruments have demonstrated that metals, such as the steel  used in scissors and machinery, are subject to fatigue, and regain  efficiency by periodic rest. The life-pulse in metals is seriously  harmed or even extinguished through the application of electric  currents or heavy pressure.\"    I looked around the room at the numerous inventions, eloquent  testimony of a tireless ingenuity.    \"Sir, it is lamentable that mass agricultural development is  not speeded by fuller use of your marvelous mechanisms. Would it  not be easily possible to employ some of them in quick laboratory  experiments to indicate the influence of various types of fertilizers  on plant growth?\"    \"You are right. Countless uses of Bose instruments will be made  by future generations. The scientist seldom knows contemporaneous  reward; it is enough to possess the joy of creative service.\"    With expressions of unreserved gratitude to the indefatigable sage,  I took my leave. \"Can the astonishing fertility of his genius ever  be exhausted?\" I thought.    No diminution came with the years. Inventing an intricate instrument,  the \"Resonant Cardiograph,\" Bose then pursued extensive researches  on innumerable Indian plants. An enormous unsuspected pharmacopoeia  of useful drugs was revealed. The cardiograph is constructed with  an unerring accuracy by which a one-hundredth part of a second  is indicated on a graph. Resonant records measure infinitesimal  pulsations in plant, animal and human structure. The great botanist  predicted that use of his cardiograph will lead to vivisection on  plants instead of animals.    \"Side by side recordings of the effects of a medicine given  simultaneously to a plant and an animal have shown astounding  unanimity in result,\" he pointed out. \"Everything in man has been  foreshadowed in the plant. Experimentation on vegetation will  contribute to lessening of human suffering.\"    Years later Bose's pioneer plant findings were substantiated by other  scientists. Work done in 1938 at Columbia University was reported  by THE NEW YORK TIMES as follows:    It has been determined within the past few years that when the  nerves transmit messages between the brain and other parts of the  body, tiny electrical impulses are being generated. These impulses  have been measured by delicate galvanometers and magnified millions  of times by modern amplifying apparatus. Until now no satisfactory  method had been found to study the passages of the impulses along  the nerve fibers in living animals or man because of the great  speed with which these impulses travel.    Drs. K. S. Cole and H. J. Curtis reported having discovered that the  long single cells of the fresh-water plant nitella, used frequently  in goldfish bowls, are virtually identical with those of single  nerve fibers. Furthermore, they found that nitella fibers, on being  excited, propagate electrical waves that are similar in every way,  except velocity, to those of the nerve fibers in animals and man.  The electrical nerve impulses in the plant were found to be much  slower than those in animals. This discovery was therefore seized  upon by the Columbia workers as a means for taking slow motion  pictures of the passage of the electrical impulses in nerves.    The nitella plant thus may become a sort of Rosetta stone for  deciphering the closely guarded secrets close to the very borderland  of mind and matter.    The poet Rabindranath Tagore was a stalwart friend of India's  idealistic scientist. To him, the sweet Bengali singer addressed  the following lines: {FN8-6}      O Hermit, call thou in the authentic words    Of that old hymn called SAMA; \"Rise! Awake!\"    Call to the man who boasts his SHASTRIC lore    From vain pedantic wranglings profitless,    Call to that foolish braggart to come forth    Out on the face of nature, this broad earth,    Send forth this call unto thy scholar band;    Together round thy sacrifice of fire    Let them all gather. So may our India,    Our ancient land unto herself return    O once again return to steadfast work,    To duty and devotion, to her trance    Of earnest meditation; let her sit    Once more unruffled, greedless, strifeless, pure,    O once again upon her lofty seat    And platform, teacher of all lands.    {FN8-1} \"All science is transcendental or else passes away. Botany  is now acquiring the right theory-the avatars of Brahma will  presently be the textbooks of natural history.\"-EMERSON.    {FN8-2} From the Latin root, CRESCERE, to increase. For his  crescograph and other inventions, Bose was knighted in 1917.    {FN8-3} The lotus flower is an ancient divine symbol in India; its  unfolding petals suggest the expansion of the soul; the growth of  its pure beauty from the mud of its origin holds a benign spiritual  promise.    {FN8-4} \"At present, only the sheerest accident brings India into  the purview of the American college student. Eight universities  (Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, Pennsylvania,  Chicago, and California) have chairs of Indology or Sanskrit,  but India is virtually unrepresented in departments of history,  philosophy, fine arts, political science, sociology, or any of  the other departments of intellectual experience in which, as we  have seen, India has made great contributions. . . . We believe,  consequently, that no department of study, particularly in the  humanities, in any major university can be fully equipped without  a properly trained specialist in the Indic phases of its discipline.  We believe, too, that every college which aims to prepare its  graduates for intelligent work in the world which is to be theirs  to live in, must have on its staff a scholar competent in the  civilization of India.\"-Extracts from an article by Professor W.

I nearly did once, for it seemed to me that I was so  necessary to Peter that nothing could separate us; but just as I was  feeling safe his father gave him a toy aeroplane, which flew when you  wound it up. The day he got it, I might not have been on the earth. I  trailed along, but he hadn't a word to say to me.    Well, something went wrong with the aeroplane the second day, and it  wouldn't fly, and then I was in solid again; but I had done some hard  thinking and I knew just where I stood. I was the newest toy, that's  what I was, and something newer might come along at any moment, and  then it would be the finish for me. The only thing for me was to do  something to impress the adults, just as Jack had said.    Goodness knows I tried. But everything I did turned out wrong. There  seemed to be a fate about it. One morning, for example, I was trotting  round the house early, and I met a fellow I could have sworn was a  burglar. He wasn't one of the family, and he wasn't one of the  servants, and he was hanging round the house in a most suspicious way.  I chased him up a tree, and it wasn't till the family came down to  breakfast, two hours later, that I found that he was a guest who had  arrived overnight, and had come out early to enjoy the freshness of the  morning and the sun shining on the lake, he being that sort of man.  That didn't help me much.    Next, I got in wrong with the boss, Peter's father. I don't know why. I  met him out in the park with another man, both carrying bundles of  sticks and looking very serious and earnest. Just as I reached him, the  boss lifted one of the sticks and hit a small white ball with it. He  had never seemed to want to play with me before, and I took it as a  great compliment. I raced after the ball, which he had hit quite a long  way, picked it up in my mouth, and brought it back to him. I laid it at  his feet, and smiled up at him.    'Hit it again,' I said.    He wasn't pleased at all. He said all sorts of things and tried to kick  me, and that night, when he thought I was not listening, I heard him  telling his wife that I was a pest and would have to be got rid of.  That made me think.    And then I put the lid on it. With the best intentions in the world I  got myself into such a mess that I thought the end had come.    It happened one afternoon in the drawing-room. There were visitors that  day--women; and women seem fatal to me. I was in the background, trying  not to be seen, for, though I had been brought in by Peter, the family  never liked my coming into the drawing-room. I was hoping for a piece  of cake and not paying much attention to the conversation, which was  all about somebody called Toto, whom I had not met. Peter's mother said  Toto was a sweet little darling, he was; and one of the visitors said  Toto had not been at all himself that day and she was quite worried.  And a good lot more about how all that Toto would ever take for dinner  was a little white meat of chicken, chopped up fine. It was not very  interesting, and I had allowed my attention to wander.    And just then, peeping round the corner of my chair to see if there  were any signs of cake, what should I see but a great beastly brute of  a rat. It was standing right beside the visitor, drinking milk out of a  saucer, if you please!    I may have my faults, but procrastination in the presence of rats is  not one of them. I didn't hesitate for a second. Here was my chance. If  there is one thing women hate, it is a rat. Mother always used to say,  'If you want to succeed in life, please the women. They are the real  bosses. The men don't count.' By eliminating this rodent I should earn  the gratitude and esteem of Peter's mother, and, if I did that, it did  not matter what Peter's father thought of me.    I sprang.    The rat hadn't a chance to get away. I was right on to him. I got hold  of his neck, gave him a couple of shakes, and chucked him across the  room. Then I ran across to finish him off.    Just as I reached him, he sat up and barked at me. I was never so taken  aback in my life. I pulled up short and stared at him.    'I'm sure I beg your pardon, sir,' I said apologetically. 'I thought  you were a rat.'    And then everything broke loose. Somebody got me by the collar,  somebody else hit me on the head with a parasol, and somebody else  kicked me in the ribs. Everybody talked and shouted at the same time.    'Poor darling Toto!' cried the visitor, snatching up the little animal.  'Did the great savage brute try to murder you!'    'So absolutely unprovoked!'    'He just flew at the poor little thing!'    It was no good my trying to explain. Any dog in my place would have  made the same mistake. The creature was a toy-dog of one of those  extraordinary breeds--a prize-winner and champion, and so on, of  course, and worth his weight in gold. I would have done better to bite  the visitor than Toto. That much I gathered from the general run of the  conversation, and then, having discovered that the door was shut, I  edged under the sofa. I was embarrassed.    'That settles it!' said Peter's mother. 'The dog is not safe. He must  be shot.'    Peter gave a yell at this, but for once he didn't swing the voting an  inch.    'Be quiet, Peter,' said his mother. 'It is not safe for you to have  such a dog. He may be mad.'    Women are very unreasonable.    Toto, of course, wouldn't say a word to explain how the mistake arose.  He was sitting on the visitor's lap, shrieking about what he would have  done to me if they hadn't separated us.    Somebody felt cautiously under the sofa. I recognized the shoes of  Weeks, the butler. I suppose they had rung for him to come and take me,  and I could see that he wasn't half liking it. I was sorry for Weeks,  who was a friend of mine, so I licked his hand, and that seemed to  cheer him up a whole lot.    'I have him now, madam,' I heard him say.    'Take him to the stables and tie him up, Weeks, and tell one of the men  to bring his gun and shoot him. He is not safe.'    A few minutes later I was in an empty stall, tied up to the manger.    It was all over. It had been pleasant while it lasted, but I had  reached the end of my tether now. I don't think I was frightened, but a  sense of pathos stole over me. I had meant so well. It seemed as if  good intentions went for nothing in this world. I had tried so hard to  please everybody, and this was the result--tied up in a dark stable,  waiting for the end.    The shadows lengthened in the stable-yard, and still nobody came. I  began to wonder if they had forgotten me, and presently, in spite of  myself, a faint hope began to spring up inside me that this might mean  that I was not to be shot after all. Perhaps Toto at the eleventh hour  had explained everything.    And then footsteps sounded outside, and the hope died away. I shut my  eyes.    Somebody put his arms round my neck, and my nose touched a warm cheek.  I opened my eyes. It was not the man with the gun come to shoot me. It  was Peter. He was breathing very hard, and he had been crying.    'Quiet!' he whispered.    He began to untie the rope.    'You must keep quite quiet, or they will hear us, and then we shall be  stopped. I'm going to take you into the woods, and we'll walk and walk  until we come to the city I told you about that's all gold and  diamonds, and we'll live there for the rest of our lives, and no one  will be able to hurt us. But you must keep very quiet.'    He went to the stable-gate and looked out. Then he gave a little  whistle to me to come after him. And we started out to find the city.    The woods were a long way away, down a hill of long grass and across a  stream; and we went very carefully, keeping in the shadows and running  across the open spaces. And every now and then we would stop and look  back, but there was nobody to be seen. The sun was setting, and  everything was very cool and quiet.    Presently we came to the stream and crossed it by a little wooden  bridge, and then we were in the woods, where nobody could see us.    I had never been in the woods before, and everything was very new and  exciting to me. There were squirrels and rabbits and birds, more than I  had ever seen in my life, and little things that buzzed and flew and  tickled my ears. I wanted to rush about and look at everything, but  Peter called to me, and I came to heel. He knew where we were going,  and I didn't, so I let him lead.    We went very slowly. The wood got thicker and thicker the farther we  got into it. There were bushes that were difficult to push through, and  long branches, covered with thorns, that reached out at you and tore at  you when you tried to get away. And soon it was quite dark, so dark  that I could see nothing, not even Peter, though he was so close. We  went slower and slower, and the darkness was full of queer noises. From  time to time Peter would stop, and I would run to him and put my nose  in his hand. At first he patted me, but after a while he did not pat me  any more, but just gave me his hand to lick, as if it was too much for  him to lift it. I think he was getting very tired. He was quite a small  boy and not strong, and we had walked a long way.    It seemed to be getting darker and darker. I could hear the sound of  Peter's footsteps, and they seemed to drag as he forced his way through  the bushes. And then, quite suddenly, he sat down without any warning,  and when I ran up I heard him crying.    I suppose there are lots of dogs who would have known exactly the right  thing to do, but I could not think of anything except to put my nose  against his cheek and whine. He put his arm round my neck, and for a  long time we stayed like that, saying nothing. It seemed to comfort  him, for after a time he stopped crying.    I did not bother him by asking about the wonderful city where we were  going, for he was so tired. But I"]]]
