She was, however, unable to do  any good, and so, holding hands, they passed out together.  As they did  so, the strange music which had so alarmed Lady Arabella suddenly  stopped.  Instinctively they all looked towards the tower of Castra  Regis, and saw that the workmen had refixed the kite, which had risen  again and was beginning to float out to its former station.    As they were looking, the door opened and Michael Watford came into the  room.  By that time all had recovered their self-possession, and there  was nothing out of the common to attract his attention.  As he came in,  seeing inquiring looks all around him, he said:    \"The new influx of birds is only the annual migration of pigeons from  Africa.  I am told that it will soon be over.\"    The second victory of Mimi Watford made Edgar Caswall more moody than  ever.  He felt thrown back on himself, and this, added to his absorbing  interest in the hope of a victory of his mesmeric powers, became a deep  and settled purpose of revenge.  The chief object of his animosity was,  of course, Mimi, whose will had overcome his, but it was obscured in  greater or lesser degree by all who had opposed him.  Lilla was next to  Mimi in his hate--Lilla, the harmless, tender-hearted, sweet-natured  girl, whose heart was so full of love for all things that in it was no  room for the passions of ordinary life--whose nature resembled those  doves of St. Columba, whose colour she wore, whose appearance she  reflected.  Adam Salton came next--after a gap; for against him Caswall  had no direct animosity.  He regarded him as an interference, a  difficulty to be got rid of or destroyed.  The young Australian had been  so discreet that the most he had against him was his knowledge of what  had been.  Caswall did not understand him, and to such a nature as his,  ignorance was a cause of alarm, of dread.    Caswall resumed his habit of watching the great kite straining at its  cord, varying his vigils in this way by a further examination of the  mysterious treasures of his house, especially Mesmer's chest.  He sat  much on the roof of the tower, brooding over his thwarted passion.  The  vast extent of his possessions, visible to him at that altitude, might,  one would have thought, have restored some of his complacency.  But the  very extent of his ownership, thus perpetually brought before him,  created a fresh sense of grievance.  How was it, he thought, that with so  much at command that others wished for, he could not achieve the dearest  wishes of his heart?    In this state of intellectual and moral depravity, he found a solace in  the renewal of his experiments with the mechanical powers of the kite.  For a couple of weeks he did not see Lady Arabella, who was always on the  watch for a chance of meeting him; neither did he see the Watford girls,  who studiously kept out of his way.  Adam Salton simply marked time,  keeping ready to deal with anything that might affect his friends.  He  called at the farm and heard from Mimi of the last battle of wills, but  it had only one consequence.  He got from Ross several more mongooses,  including a second king-cobra-killer, which he generally carried with him  in its box whenever he walked out.    Mr. Caswall's experiments with the kite went on successfully.  Each day  he tried the lifting of greater weight, and it seemed almost as if the  machine had a sentience of its own, which was increasing with the  obstacles placed before it.  All this time the kite hung in the sky at an  enormous height.  The wind was steadily from the north, so the trend of  the kite was to the south.  All day long, runners of increasing magnitude  were sent up.  These were only of paper or thin cardboard, or leather, or  other flexible materials.  The great height at which the kite hung made a  great concave curve in the string, so that as the runners went up they  made a flapping sound.  If one laid a finger on the string, the sound  answered to the flapping of the runner in a sort of hollow intermittent  murmur.  Edgar Caswall, who was now wholly obsessed by the kite and all  belonging to it, found a distinct resemblance between that intermittent  rumble and the snake-charming music produced by the pigeons flying  through the dry reeds.    One day he made a discovery in Mesmer's chest which he thought he would  utilise with regard to the runners.  This was a great length of wire,  \"fine as human hair,\" coiled round a finely made wheel, which ran to a  wondrous distance freely, and as lightly.  He tried this on runners, and  found it work admirably.  Whether the runner was alone, or carried  something much more weighty than itself, it worked equally well.  Also it  was strong enough and light enough to draw back the runner without undue  strain.  He tried this a good many times successfully, but it was now  growing dusk and he found some difficulty in keeping the runner in sight.  So he looked for something heavy enough to keep it still.  He placed the  Egyptian image of Bes on the fine wire, which crossed the wooden ledge  which protected it.  Then, the darkness growing, he went indoors and  forgot all about it.    He had a strange feeling of uneasiness that night--not sleeplessness, for  he seemed conscious of being asleep.  At daylight he rose, and as usual  looked out for the kite.  He did not see it in its usual position in the  sky, so looked round the points of the compass.  He was more than  astonished when presently he saw the missing kite struggling as usual  against the controlling cord.  But it had gone to the further side of the  tower, and now hung and strained _against the wind_ to the north.  He  thought it so strange that he determined to investigate the phenomenon,  and to say nothing about it in the meantime.    In his many travels, Edgar Caswall had been accustomed to use the  sextant, and was now an expert in the matter.  By the aid of this and  other instruments, he was able to fix the position of the kite and the  point over which it hung.  He was startled to find that exactly under  it--so far as he could ascertain--was Diana's Grove.  He had an  inclination to take Lady Arabella into his confidence in the matter, but  he thought better of it and wisely refrained.  For some reason which he  did not try to explain to himself, he was glad of his silence, when, on  the following morning, he found, on looking out, that the point over  which the kite then hovered was Mercy Farm.  When he had verified this  with his instruments, he sat before the window of the tower, looking out  and thinking.  The new locality was more to his liking than the other;  but the why of it puzzled him, all the same.  He spent the rest of the  day in the turret-room, which he did not leave all day.  It seemed to him  that he was now drawn by forces which he could not control--of which,  indeed, he had no knowledge--in directions which he did not understand,  and which were without his own volition.  In sheer helpless inability to  think the problem out satisfactorily, he called up a servant and told him  to tell Oolanga that he wanted to see him at once in the turret-room.  The  answer came back that the African had not been seen since the previous  evening.    Caswall was now so irritable that even this small thing upset him.  As he  was distrait and wanted to talk to somebody, he sent for Simon Chester,  who came at once, breathless with hurrying and upset by the unexpected  summons.  Caswall bade him sit down, and when the old man was in a less  uneasy frame of mind, he again asked him if he had ever seen what was in  Mesmer's chest or heard it spoken about.    Chester admitted that he had once, in the time of \"the then Mr. Edgar,\"  seen the chest open, which, knowing something of its history and guessing  more, so upset him that he had fainted.  When he recovered, the chest was  closed.  From that time the then Mr. Edgar had never spoken about it  again.    When Caswall asked him to describe what he had seen when the chest was  open, he got very agitated, and, despite all his efforts to remain calm,  he suddenly went off into a faint.  Caswall summoned servants, who  applied the usual remedies.  Still the old man did not recover.  After  the lapse of a considerable time, the doctor who had been summoned made  his appearance.  A glance was sufficient for him to make up his mind.  Still, he knelt down by the old man, and made a careful examination.  Then  he rose to his feet, and in a hushed voice said:    \"I grieve to say, sir, that he has passed away.\"          CHAPTER XV--ON THE TRACK      Those who had seen Edgar Caswall familiarly since his arrival, and had  already estimated his cold-blooded nature at something of its true value,  were surprised that he took so to heart the death of old Chester.  The  fact was that not one of them had guessed correctly at his character.  They thought, naturally enough, that the concern which he felt was that  of a master for a faithful old servant of his family.  They little  thought that it was merely the selfish expression of his disappointment,  that he had thus lost the only remaining clue to an interesting piece of  family history--one which was now and would be for ever wrapped in  mystery.  Caswall knew enough about the life of his ancestor in Paris to  wish to know more fully and more thoroughly all that had been.  The  period covered by that ancestor's life in Paris was one inviting every  form of curiosity.    Lady Arabella, who had her own game to play, saw in the _metier_ of  sympathetic friend, a series of meetings with the man she wanted to  secure.  She made the first use of the opportunity the day after old  Chester's death; indeed, as soon as the news had filtered in through the  back door of Diana's Grove.  At that meeting, she played her part so well  that even Caswall's cold nature was impressed.    Oolanga was the only one "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#16)"],[1," tell you that  Bill has told me pretty much everything that ever went on between you  two. All about the correspondence-school work and about the letters and  about the pictures.\"    \"I don't understand,\" murmured the girl faintly.    But Ronicky diplomatically raised his voice and went on, as if he had  not heard her. \"You know what he's done with that picture of yours?\"    \"No,\" she said faintly.    \"He got the biggest nugget that he's ever taken out of the dirt. He got  it beaten out into the right shape, and then he made a locket out of it  and put your picture in it, and now he wears it around his neck, even  when he's working at the mine.\"    Her breath caught. \"That silly, cheap snapshot!\"    She stopped. She had admitted everything already, and she had intended  to be a very sphinx with this strange Westerner.    \"It was only a joke,\" she said. \"I--I didn't really mean to--\"    \"Do you know what that joke did?\" asked Ronicky. \"It made two men fight,  then cross the continent together and get on the trail of a girl whose  name they didn't even know. They found the girl, and then she said she'd  forgotten--but no, I don't mean to blame you. There's something queer  behind it all. But I want to explain one thing. The reason that Bill  didn't get to that train wasn't because he didn't try. He did try. He  tried so hard that he got into a fight with a gent that tried to hold  him up for a few words, and Bill got shot off his hoss.\"    \"Shot?\" asked the girl. \"Shot?\"    Suddenly she was clutching his arm, terrified at the thought. She  recovered herself at once and drew away, eluding the hand of Ronicky. He  made no further attempt to detain her.    But he had lifted the mask and seen the real state of her mind; and she,  too, knew that the secret was discovered. It angered her and threw her  instantly on the aggressive.    \"I tell you what I guessed from the window,\" said Ronicky. \"You went  down to the street, all prepared to meet up with poor old Bill--\"    \"Prepared to meet him?\" She started up at Ronicky. \"How in the world  could I ever guess--\"    She was looking up to him, trying to drag his eyes down to hers, but  Ronicky diplomatically kept his attention straight ahead.    \"You couldn't guess,\" he suggested, \"but there was someone who could  guess for you. Someone who pretty well knew we were in town, who wanted  to keep you away from Bill because he was afraid--\"    \"Of what?\" she demanded sharply.    \"Afraid of losing you.\"    This seemed to frighten her. \"What do you know?\" she asked.    \"I know this,\" he answered, \"that I think a girl like you, all in all,  is too good for any man. But, if any man ought to have her, it's the  gent that is fondest of her. And Bill is terrible fond of you, lady--he  don't think of nothing else. He's grown thin as a ghost, longing for  you.\"    \"So he sends another man to risk his life to find me and tell me about  it?\" she demanded, between anger and sadness.    \"He didn't send me--I just came. But the reason I came was because I  knew Bill would give up without a fight.\"    \"I hate a man who won't fight,\" said the girl.    \"It's because he figures he's so much beneath you,\" said Ronicky. \"And,  besides, he can't talk about himself. He's no good at that at all. But,  if it comes to fighting, lady, why, he rode a couple of hosses to death  and stole another and had a gunfight, all for the sake of seeing you,  when a train passed through a town.\"    She was speechless.    \"So I thought I'd come,\" said Ronicky Doone, \"and tell you the insides  of things, the way I knew Bill wouldn't and couldn't, but I figure it  don't mean nothing much to you.\"    She did not answer directly. She only said: \"Are men like this in the  West? Do they do so much for their friends?\"    \"For a gent like Bill Gregg, that's simple and straight from the  shoulder, they ain't nothing too good to be done for him. What I'd do  for him he'd do mighty pronto for me, and what he'd do for me--well,  don't you figure that he'd do ten times as much for the girl he loves?  Be honest with me,\" said Ronicky Doone. \"Tell me if Bill means anymore  to you than any stranger?\"    \"No--yes.\"    \"Which means simply yes. But how much more, lady?\"    \"I hardly know him. How can I say?\"    \"It's sure an easy thing to say. You've wrote to him. You've had letters  from him. You've sent him your picture, and he's sent you his, and  you've seen him on the street. Lady, you sure know Bill Gregg, and what  do you think of him?\"    \"I think--\"    \"Is he a square sort of gent?\"    \"Y-yes.\"    \"The kind you'd trust?\"    \"Yes, but--\"    \"Is he the kind that would stick to the girl he loved and take care of  her, through thick and thin?\"    \"You mustn't talk like this,\" said Caroline Smith, but her voice  trembled, and her eyes told him to go on.    \"I'm going back and tell Bill Gregg that, down in your heart, you love  him just about the same as he loves you!\"    \"Oh,\" she asked, \"would you say a thing like that? It isn't a bit true.\"    \"I'm afraid that's the way I see it. When I tell him that, you can lay  to it that old Bill will let loose all holds and start for you, and, if  they's ten brick walls and twenty gunmen in between, it won't make no  difference. He'll find you, or die trying.\"    Before he finished she was clinging to his arm.    \"If you tell him, you'll be doing a murder, Ronicky Doone. What he'll  face will be worse than twenty gunmen.\"    \"The gent that smiles, eh?\"    \"Yes, John Mark. No, no, I didn't mean--\"    \"But you did, and I knew it, too. It's John Mark that's between you and  Bill. I seen you in the street, when you were talking to poor Bill, look  back over your shoulder at that devil standing in the window of this  house.\"    \"Don't call him that!\"    \"D'you know of one drop of kindness in his nature, lady?\"    \"Are we quite alone?\"    \"Not a soul around.\"    \"Then he is a devil, and, being a devil, no ordinary man has a chance  against him--not a chance, Ronicky Doone. I don't know what you did in  the house, but I think you must have outfaced him in some way. Well, for  that you'll pay, be sure! And you'll pay with your life, Ronicky. Every  minute, now, you're in danger of your life. You'll keep on being in  danger, until he feels that he has squared his account with you. Don't  you see that if I let Bill Gregg come near me--\"    \"Then Bill will be in danger of this same wolf of a man, eh? And, in  spite of the fact that you like Bill--\"    \"Ah, yes, I do!\"    \"That you love him, in fact.\"    \"Why shouldn't I tell you?\" demanded the girl, breaking down suddenly.  \"I do love him, and I can never see him to tell him, because I dread  John Mark.\"    \"Rest easy,\" said Ronicky, \"you'll see Bill, or else he'll die trying to  get to you.\"    \"If you're his friend--\"    \"I'd rather see him dead than living the rest of his life, plumb  unhappy.\"    She shook her head, arguing, and so they reached the corner of Beekman  Place again and turned into it and went straight toward the house  opposite that of John Mark. Still the girl argued, but it was in a  whisper, as if she feared that terrible John Mark might overhear.           *       *       *       *       *    In the home of John Mark, that calm leader was still with Ruth Tolliver.  They had gone down to the lower floor of the house, and, at his request,  she sat at the piano, while Mark sat comfortably beyond the sphere of  the piano light and watched her.    \"You're thinking of something else,\" he told her, \"and playing  abominably.\"    \"I'm sorry.\"    \"You ought to be,\" he said. \"It's bad enough to play poorly for someone  who doesn't know, but it's torture to play like that for me.\"    He spoke without violence, as always, but she knew that he was intensely  angry, and that familiar chill passed through her body. It never failed  to come when she felt that she had aroused his anger.    \"Why doesn't Caroline come back?\" she asked at length.    \"She's letting him talk himself out, that's all. Caroline's a clever  youngster. She knows how to let a man talk till his throat is dry, and  then she'll smile and tell him that it's impossible to agree with him.  Yes, there are many possibilities in Caroline.\"    \"You think Ronicky Doone is a gambler?\" she asked, harking back to what  he had said earlier.    \"I think so,\" answered John Mark, and again there was that tightening of  the muscles around his mouth. \"A gambler has a certain way of masking  his own face and looking at yours, as if he were dragging your thoughts  out through your eyes; also, he's very cool; he belongs at a table with  the cards on it and the stakes high.\"    The door opened. \"Here's young Rose. He'll tell us the truth of the  matter. Has she come back, Rose?\"    The young fellow kept far back in the shadow, and, when he spoke, his  voice was uncertain, almost to the point of trembling. \"No,\" he managed  to say, \"she ain't come back, chief.\"    Mark stared at him for a moment and then slowly opened a cigarette case  and lighted a smoke. \"Well,\" he said, and his words were far more  violent than the smooth voice, \"well, idiot, what did she do?\"    \"She done a fade-away, chief, in the house across the street. Went in  with that other gent.\"    \"He took her by force?\" asked John Mark.    \"Nope. She slipped in quick enough and all by herself. He went in last.\"    \"Damnation!\" murmured Mark. \"That's all, Rose.\"    His follower vanished through the doorway and closed the door softly  after him. John Mark stood up and paced quietly up and down the room. At  length he turned abruptly on the girl. \"Good night. I have business that  takes me out.\"    \"What is it?\" she asked eagerly.    He paused, as if in doubt as to how he should answer her, if he answered  at all. \"In the old days,\" he said at last, \"when a man caught a poacher  on his grounds, do you know what he did?\"    \"No.\"    \"Shot him, my dear, without a thought and threw his body to the wolves!\"    \"John Mark! Do you mean--\"   "]]]
