Pardon, in those  days it wasn't lunch--it was dinner, at or near midday.  Then we  had supper at the close of day.  Anyway, Mama and I would hook  Old Ribbon to the old buggy and take Papa his dinner every day.  One day we took Papa's dinner to him and found him sawing down  trees where the railroad was to cross Dry Callie Creek.  While we  were there, he sawed into the hollow of a big elm tree and water  gushed out.  After the tree fell, the hollow stump was standing  full of water.  Of course, you've got to be a little kid for  something like that to impress you.  And that's what I was.    But it was another day that Old Ribbon impressed me.  It was  almost dinner time when Mama and I hooked her to the old buggy to  take Papa his dinner.  As usual, I was in the seat with Mama, and  the grub box was in the floor at our feet.  It was covered with a  clean white cloth to keep the flies and dust away.    Now, we hadn't gone more than a hundred yards from our house when  Old Ribbon had to do what comes natural for all horses to do.  But this time Old Ribbon had symptoms of dysentery and gas.  Either one without the other wouldn't have been so bad.  But both  together made it plenty bad.    The dashboard was only half large enough.  It caught what it  could; Mama and I caught most of the rest.  And the white cloth  over Papa's dinner caught its share--but it wasn't white any  more.  In your eyes, it burned, in your nose, it smelled  terrible, and in your mouth, it tasted a lot like what it really  was.    No question about it, there was just one thing to do, go back  home, wash up, wash the buggy, change clothes, change the cloth  over the dinner, hope it didn't go through onto the biscuits, get  going again and take Papa a late dinner.  Ho hum, dull life on  the farm, no excitement.    Papa may have been hungry by the time we got his dinner to him  and he may have been worried and weary.  He may have been upset  and Mama may have been upset but they couldn't afford to say  anything bad.  They didn't allow any sort of rough language in  our family.    Old Ribbon was a good gentle horse for Mama and us kids, but Papa  had some big horses he used to move heavy loads and haul his  cotton to the gin.  And in the rush cotton picking season, we  kids and Mama picked almost all of the cotton, while Papa took it  to town, got it ginned and then sold it.    There were many days when Papa would leave home before five  o'clock in the morning with a load of cotton, wait his turn at  the gin and not get home until after ten that night.    Ginning was slow in those days.  Sometimes it would mean that  Papa could get home an hour or two earlier if he could get to the  gin ahead of just one other farmer.  So, a good team was valuable  to a farmer during the cotton harvest season.    I never heard Papa tell of trying to go around another farmer on  his way to the gin.  But I have heard him tell of speeding up to  beat another man to a crossroads in order to be ahead of him when  they both turned the last corner toward town.  And I have heard  him tell of others trying to pass him on the road.  But I never  heard of one who succeeded.  Papa drove big horses with a lot of  endurance, and on a three-mile stretch of level road, they  usually held their own.    Despite all the work we had to do, we kids played a lot and had a  lot of fun.  When it rained at the Exum place, water ran out of  our pasture, across the parking area by our front yard, and  continued on down a road toward the blacksmith shop.    It had just come a hard rain and was still sprinkling a little.  So we took shovels and damned up the road where it was deepest  and not spread out so much.  Water was flowing into our small  lake almost as fast as we could build the dam.  The water backed  up and covered the parking area by our front yard.  By the time  the water stopped flowing and we stopped building the dam, water  was as much as three feet deep over an area as large as two or  three city lots.    I don't remember where Frank got his boat.  Nor do I know how  long he kept it nor whether he built it especially for that  occasion.  But I do know we went riding in his boat just outside  our front yard.  They even took Kodak pictures of us in the boat  on our little lake.    In two or three days the dam had to be destroyed and the lake  drained so we could use the road again and so we could get in and  out of our front yard.    The years passed quickly and during the period from 1912 to 1916  things were happening fast in our part of the country.  Hamlin  was growing up.  In the fall of the years, they had their fairs,  with their carnivals, large hot-air balloons, motorcycle races  and livestock shows.  Prosperity was spreading over our country  and everyone who wanted to work could get a job.    Frank took his horse and buggy and carried the mail at times, as  a substitute carrier.  But for some reason unknown to me, he  became disenchanted with the job and gave it up.    Papa bought our first auto in 1916.  It was a 1914 model Reo,  five-passenger touring car--the cost, $800.  We drove it until  1922, then junked it.    That Reo car had a feature I have never seen on any other car.  The left pedal was a clutch pedal the first half-way down.  The  remainder of the way down, it became a foot brake.  The right  pedal was an emergency brake.  Both had ratchet-type bars  underneath which held them down to the desired place.    Handy?  You bet!  Many car owners wished their cars had the  clutch and brake under one foot.  It was especially handy when  starting a car headed uphill, because it left the right foot free  to work the gas feed.    The old Reo didn't have a lot of power to brag about--maybe about  as much as a couple of wooden-legged donkeys.  I remember we went  to Lamesa in it one time.  Going up the Cap Rock, it just  couldn't make it alone.  The road was steep and rocky.  The  Buick, which we bought later, would go up the hill with all of us  still in the car.  But the Reo was different.    We not only had to get out and walk up, we had to push the Reo up  too.  There were about four or five of us pushing, and two of us  were carrying rocks to put behind the wheels when it stopped.  Then the driver would \"rev\" up the motor, let up on the clutch,  and with all of us working together, we would move the car  forward and upward two or three steps.  Then again, rocks behind  the wheels--quickly.    That kind of life gave people something to do besides griping and  asking Washington for handouts.  It also gave a man pride in  ownership, especially if the car he owned would outdo the car his  neighbor owned.    Bragging on your car was a way of life in early carhood days.  If  a man had a car that could do anything his neighbors couldn't do,  that was something to brag about.  No two cars were alike.    But now, 60 years later, we find that auto-makers have wiped out  all differences and are making all cars alike.  No matter which  company made the car you are driving today, you have nothing to  brag about.  Today's cars all have at least four things in  common-  -they are too big, too powerful, too costly and burn too much  gasoline.    But it hasn't always been that way.  About the same year we  bought our Reo, a neighbor family of ours had a flat tire.  They  set the emergency brake while they jacked up the car to put the  spare on.  Then when they got going again, they forgot to release  the brake and drove about a half-mile with the brake on.  Later,  one of the boys in that family bragged that their car was so  powerful it went a half-mile with both hind wheels sliding.    My brother, Frank, got rid of his motorcycle and his Buick car  and bought a Grant auto.  It had a reputation of having great  power.  They said you could run the front bumper up against a  tree and it had enough power to sit there and spin the wheels on  dry land.  That was a lot of power for that time.    One fellow who didn't think too highly of the Grant said he knew  a man who bought one and, not having a garage to lock it in,  drove it out by his hog pen and chained it to the pen.  That  night some thieves came, cut the chain and stole the pen.    But before cars made it so handy for farmers to drive into town  to buy supplies, peddlers were already plentiful, bringing  supplies to the farmers.    Horse-drawn rigs were apt to pull up at our farm almost anytime.  They had for sale most anything you might want, from kitchen  utensils to medicine; hardware to veterinarian supplies; needles  and thread and blue denim.  You name it--they had it--even  horseshoes and nails.    With the new prosperity came growth, and as a country grows so do  her cities and towns.  And as towns prosper, they breed violence.    I was only a kid but I heard some grownups telling about a man  who got shot in Hamlin.  One man was after another man with a  shotgun.  He got off one good shot, which proved to be effective  enough.  The man who got shot ran into a hardware store, ran  through the store and out into the alley, up the alley a few  doors, then ran back into a drygoods store.  There he crawled  under a counter to hide and died.  That's how I remember it.  That's all I ever heard about it.  I don't know who got shot nor  why.    During all this time, naturally, we kids were growing up too.  Frank was almost a grown man and Susie had fallen in love.  When  she was born, they named her Susie.  But it wasn't long till her  Aunt Annie nicknamed her \"Sookie.\"  She hated that nickname ever-  so-much.  Nevertheless, she was stuck with it until she began to  get serious about having Dode Sanford over to our house for  supper quite a few times through the week and almost every Sunday  night.  Then she began asking us kids to call her Susie.  She  even gave us a penny now and then to do so.

From that time I began to gather  strength. That was my first experience with the ordinance of healing by  the laying on of hands by the Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints.        CHAPTER VIII.

AT the camp at Dry Lake, which we reached between November 20 and 25,  we laid over a day, and a party was sent ahead to cut a road over the  divide. I was too weak for four or five days to take much interest in  what passed; and in the meantime the command reached and crossed the  divide, or summit of the Rocky Mountains--the backbone of the North  American continent--where the waters are divided, flowing on either  side to the Atlantic and Pacific respectively.    For eighteen hundred miles the Mormon Battalion members had made a hard  and weary march. Starting from Nauvoo, on the Mississippi River--the  \"father of waters\"--as exiles, they had passed over a lovely country,  yet at a season of the year when travel was difficult, to the Missouri  River. At the latter point the battalion was mustered into service, and  moved over an excellent country two hundred miles to Fort Leavenworth;  thence through what is now the state of Kansas, passing over a goodly  land to the Great Plains, a timberless country, where water is scarce.  There they began to be footsore and leg-weary, and to suffer severely  from heat and thirst. Soon they came to the desert, and for nine days  tried cooking their shortened rations over \"buffalo chip\" fires, with  fuel even scarcer than it was poor; often having very little water, and  that brackish, so that men and hearts began to grow weak and ill.    At this point in the long journey they commenced passing the open  graves of soldiers, many of whom laid down their lives in the advance  companies. Their graves were open for the reason that wolves had dug  up the dead bodies and devoured the flesh from the bones; the blankets  in which the bodies were wrapped were torn to shreds, while in some  instances the carcass still hung together, except that the fingers and  toes had been eaten off by wild beasts. The road was also strewn with  dead horses and cattle, so that as the battalion advanced the gruesome  sights became more frequent and therefore excited less comment. And in  turn the battalion contributed a share of dead to the lonely graves of  the plains.    Then, on the sandy roads, there was the rough order to put the shoulder  to the wheel and help the jaded teams; and the battalion waded creeks  and rivers with quicksand bottoms, or lifted or pulled at ropes in  lowering or raising their wagons over rough and precipitous places--in  what appeared at that time a rough and worthless country, which may not  have changed greatly since.    At times they were called forward to tramp sand roads for teams, and  then to return and pull at ropes or push at wagons which, without  assistance, the teams could not control. Then when Santa Fe was passed  the journey was proceeded upon with reduced rations, down the difficult  country along the Rio Grande del Norte. Onward the struggle continued,  over sandy deserts and through a rough, mountainous region, where the  hardships were intense, and where there seemed no eye to pity and no  hand to pass even a drop of water to moisten the parching tongue. It  was not human capability, it was the divine power that sustained them  in such extremities as they had to endure.    It was thus the renowned Mormon Battalion toiled and struggled on their  journey to the summit of the lofty Rocky Mountain range--the crest  of the continent--a journey whose details of privation, and peril,  and patient courage, cannot be told in human words, and never can be  realized except by those who experienced it. So many lofty mountain  spurs had been crossed, that the final ascent seemed quite gradual.    Leaving now this general survey of the past, I recall that from the  lofty eminence we had reached on our march, the descent was very abrupt  and difficult, through the rugged defiles to the west. But with the  battalion it was a case of life and death. That was no place to remain,  there was no earthly help at hand, no way to life open but to trust  in God and persevere in the onward movement. So with the pick-axe and  crow-bar we commenced to clear the most feasible road down by chopping  away the shrubbery and brush and removing that and the rocks.    After much of the baggage had been taken down the mountain one way by  pack animals, long ropes and guy-ropes were attached to the wagons and  the descent with them began by another way. The wagons were lowered for  a distance of half a mile or so, men standing as best they could on  the mountain side, letting the vehicle down gradually, then holding it  till other men could get a fresh footing and lower it still further.  Thus one by one the wagons were let down in safety, all but one. By  some mishap that got adrift from the men, and to save their lives they  had to let it go until there was nothing of it but scrap-iron and  kindling-wood. As there was already an abundance of the latter around  us, no one was desirous of descending to the rugged depths of the  ravine to secure even a relic of that terrible descent.    It was thought by our commander and guides that it would require from  six to eight days to make the descent, but thanks to the tact and skill  of some of our men who had been accustomed to frontier life, the work  was done in two days, and we were again where the wagons could stand on  partially level ground.    In a very brief space of time we found ourselves plunged into a warm  climate, where we could not see any plant or shrub that we had been  acquainted with before. There was some small, scrubby ash, sycamore  and black walnut, but everything, even to the rocks, had a strange  appearance. We also had entered the land of wild horses and cattle,  which roamed the hills by thousands. The wild cattle became excited at  the rumbling wagons, and gathered thickly along our way.    At last the muskets commenced to rattle, partly through fear, and  partly because we wanted beef. Finally a herd of wild cattle charged  our line, tossed some men into the air, pierced others with their  horns, knocking some down, and ran over others, attacking one light  wagon, the hind end of which was lifted clear from the road. One large  bull plunged into a six-mule team, ran his head under the off-swing  mule, throwing him entirely over the near one and thrusting his horn  into the mule's vitals, injuring our animal so it had to be left on the  ground, where it expired in a few minutes. There were several men and  mules roughly used and bruised, just the number I do not now recall.  The attacking party lost twenty or twenty-five of their number killed,  with many others badly or slightly wounded.    We had plenty of beef for a few days, and might have secured much  more. I never understood the reason why we were not allowed to lay  by and \"jerk\" an abundance of meat for the subsequent use of the  command, but the stop was not permitted. Many of the men felt greatly  disappointed and indignant because we were denied the privilege of  availing ourselves of this splendid opportunity of replenishing our  scanty rations. We were half starving at the time, and perhaps if we  had been allowed to lay by a few days we would have gorged ourselves to  our injury. It may be that would have been more serious than to have  stormed, as some did, at being ordered to march on. It is possible this  was the view taken by our commander, though we never knew.    Continuing our advance to lower levels, the climate was mild and  pleasant. Our course was northwesterly until we passed a deserted  ranch called San Bernardino, in what is now Arizona, and followed  down the San Pedro River. I think this was the south fork of the Gila  River. There was some good country along this lovely stream. It was  there we first saw the mescal and mesquit, the former being the plant  from which the Mexicans distil their whisky (pulque), the latter a tree  somewhat resembling the black locust, but growing with a very spreading  habit, making it difficult to travel among. In many places it had to be  cut down and cleared away before we could proceed. There was another  scrubby tree-growth which the Spaniards call chapparal. This brush grew  very thick in places, so that in cutting it away travel became very  tedious.    Here the guides told Colonel Cooke that if we followed along the stream  it would be a hundred miles farther than if we cut across the bend, but  if we took the latter route we would have to pass through a Mexican  fortified town, where a body of soldiers had been left to guard it as  an outpost. At that time it was impossible for us to learn the strength  of the place; but it was thought that we might get some supplies of  provisions and some animals. At the same time there was considerable  risk"]]]
