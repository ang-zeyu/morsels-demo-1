After a time his father said that Lita must marry; so marriage  go-betweens were sent out to look for a bride and they found a very  rich and beautiful girl whose parents were agreeable to the match. But  the girl herself said that she would only marry a man who would build  a covered passage from her house to his, so that she could walk to her  new home in the shade. The go-betweens reported this, and Lita's father  and brothers consulted and agreed that they could never make such a  passage, but Lita said to his father: \"Arrange the match; it shall  be my charge to arrange for making the covered passage; I will not  let you be put to shame over it.\" For Lita had already put the ring  to the test: he had dropped it into a _seer_ of milk and said \"Let  five _bharias_ of parched rice and two _bharias_ of curds appear\" and  immediately the parched rice and curds were before him; and thereupon  he had called out \"The snake has worthily rewarded me for saving his  life;\" and the cat and the otter and the rat overheard what he said.    So the go-between was told to arrange for the wedding to take place  that very month, as Lita's birthday fell in the next month, which  therefore was not suitable for his wedding. Then the bride's family  sent him back to say that they were prepared to send a string of nine  knots; and the next day the go-between told this to Lita's family  and they said that they were willing to accept it; so the go-between  brought a string of nine knots to signify that the wedding would take  place in nine days. The days passed by and Lita's father and brothers  became very anxious because they saw no sign of the covered passage;  but on the very night before the wedding, Lita took his ring and  ordered a covered passage to be made from the one house to the other  with a good path down the middle; and the next morning they found  it made; and the bridegroom's party passed along it to the bride's  house and the bride was escorted home along it.    Now the bride had been deeply in love with another young man who lived  in her village and had much wished to marry him but her wishes of  course were not consulted in the matter. Some time after the marriage  she one day in the course of conversation asked her husband Lita how  much he had spent on making the covered passage to her house and how  he had built it so quickly. He told her that he knew nothing about it;  that his father and mother had arranged for it and no doubt had spent a  large sum of money. So the next day she took an opportunity of asking  her mother-in-law about it, but Lita's mother said that nothing had  been spent at all; somehow the passage had been made in one night,  she knew not how.    Then Lita's wife saw that Lita was keeping a secret from her, and  she began to reproach him for having any secrets from his wife: and  at last when she had faithfully promised never to reveal the matter  to anyone, he told her the secret of the ring. Now her former lover  used still to visit her and one day she sent for him and said that she  would no longer live with Lita, but wished to run away with him. The  lover at first objected that they would be pursued and killed while if  they escaped to a distance he would have nothing to support her with;  but the faithless woman said that there need be no anxiety about that  and she told him about the magic ring and how by means of it they  could provide themselves with a house and everything they wanted. So  they fixed a night for the elopement and on that night when Lita  was asleep his wife quietly drew the ring off his finger and went  out to her lover who was waiting outside and told him to get a goat  from the pen; then they beheaded the goat and went inside and poured  all its blood on the ground under the bed on which Lita was sleeping,  and then having hid the body and head of the goat, they ran away.    Towards morning Lita woke up and missed his wife, so he lit a lamp to  look for her and then saw the pool of blood under the bed. At this  sight he was terror stricken. Some enemy had killed and carried off  his wife and he would be charged with the murder. So he lay there  wondering what would happen to him. At last his mother came into the  room to see why he and his wife had not got up as usual and when she  saw the blood she raised a cry; the village headman and chowkidar  were sent for and they questioned Lita, but he could only say that  he knew nothing of what had happened; he did not know what the blood  was, he did not know where his wife was. Thereupon they sent two men  to the house of the wife's parents to see if by any chance she had  run away there and in any case to bring her relations to be present  at the enquiry into her disappearance. When her father and brothers  heard what had happened they at once went to Lita's house in wrath  and abused him as a murderer. They asked why, if his wife had not done  her duty to him, he had not sent her back to them to be chastised and  taught better, instead of murdering her and they went straight to the  magistrate and complained: the magistrate sent police who arrested  Lita and took him before the magistrate.    Meanwhile it had become known that not only was Lita's wife missing  but also her lover; and Lita's father presented a petition to the  magistrate bringing this to notice and asserting that the two must  have run away together. Then the magistrate ordered every search to be  made for the missing couple but said that Lita must remain in custody  till they were found, so he was shut up in prison. From prison he made  an application to the magistrate that his three tame animals, the cat  and the otter and the rat might be brought to the place where he was;  the magistrate kindly consented but the animals were not allowed  into the prison. However at night the rat being small made its way  inside and found out Lita, and asked what was to be done. Lita said  that he wanted the three animals to save him from his great danger  as he had saved them; he wanted them to trace his wife and her lover  and recover the ring; they would doubtless find them living in some  gorgeous palace, the gift of the ring.    The rat went out and gave the other two Lita's message and they  readily undertook to do their best; so the next morning the three  animals set off. In vain they hunted all over the country, till one  day they came to the bank of the Ganges and there on the other side  they saw a palace shining like gold. At this their hopes revived,  for this might be a palace made by the magic ring. But the cat and  the rat objected that they could not cross the river. The otter said  that he would easily manage that and he took the cat on his back and  the rat climbed on to the back of the cat and so the otter ferried  them both across the river; then they consulted and decided that  it would be safest to wait till the evening before they went to the  palace to see who lived in it. When they looked in in the evening,  they at once recognised Lita's wife and her lover; but these two were  in constant terror of being pursued and when they had had their evening  meal they fastened and bolted every entrance so securely that no one  could gain admittance. Then the cat and the otter told the rat that  he must collect all the rats of the neighbourhood and they must burrow  through the wall and find some way of abstracting the magic ring.    So the rat collected a crowd of his friends and in no time they bored  a hole through the wall; then they all began to look for the ring;  they hunted high and low but could not find it; however the cat sat  at the entrance of the hole which they had made and vowed that they  should not come out, unless they got the ring. Then the first rat  climbed on to the bed in which the couple were sleeping and searched  their clothes and examined their fingers and toes but in vain; then  he thought that the woman might have it in her mouth so he climbed  on to her chest and tickled her nose with the tip of his tail; this  made her sneeze and behold she sneezed out the ring which she had  hidden in her mouth. The rat seized it and ran off with it and when  the cat was satisfied that he had really got it, she let him out and  the three friends set off rejoicing on their homeward journey. They  crossed the river in the same way as when they came with the cat  riding on the otter and the rat on the cat: and the rat held the  ring in its mouth. Unfortunately when they were halfway across,  a kite swooped down to try and carry off the rat. Twice it swooped  and missed its grasp but the second time it struck the rat with its  wing and the rat in terror let the ring fall into the river.    When they reached the bank the three friends consulted what they  were to do in this fresh misfortune. As the otter was the only one  who could swim it volunteered to look for the ring, so it plunged  into the water and searched the bottom of the river in vain; then it  guessed that a fish must have swallowed the ring and it set to work  to catch every fish it saw and tore them open; at last in the stomach  of a big fish it found the ring, so it brought the fish to the bank  and while they were all rejoicing and eating a little of the fish a  kite swooped down and carried off the fish, ring and all.    The three animals watched the kite flying away with the fish; but some  women who were gathering firewood ran after the kite and took the fish  from it and putting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#16)"],[1,"rought,  Vercingetorix is delivered over; the arms are cast at Caesar's feet.  Except the AEduans and Arvernians, whom Caesar kept for the purpose of  trying to regain their people, he had the prisoners distributed, head by  head, to his army as booty of war.\"    [Illustration: Vercingetorix surrenders to Caesar----81]    The account of Dion Cassius is more varied and dramatic.  \"After the  defeat,\" says he, \"Vercingetorix, who was neither captured nor wounded,  might have fled; but, hoping that the friendship that had once bound him  to Caesar might gain him grace, he repaired to the Roman without previous  demand of peace by the voice of a herald, and appeared suddenly in his  presence, just as Caesar was seating himself upon his tribunal.  The  apparition of the Gallic chieftain inspired no little terror, for he was  of lofty stature, and had an imposing appearance in arms.  There was a  deep silence.  Vercingetorix fell at Caesar's feet, and made supplication  by touch of hand without speaking a word.  The scene moved those present  with pity, remembering the ancient fortunes of Vercingetorix and  comparing them with his present disaster.  Caesar, on the contrary, found  proof of criminality in the very memories relied upon for salvation,  contrasted the late struggle with the friendship appealed to by  Vercingetorix, and so put in a more hideous light the odiousness of his  conduct.  And thus, far from being moved by his misfortunes at the  moment, he threw him in chains forthwith, and subsequently had him put to  death, after keeping him to adorn his triumph.\"    Another historian, contemporary with Plutarch, Florus, attributes to  Vercingetorix, as he fell down and cast his arms at Caesar's feet, these  words: \"Bravest of men, thou hast conquered a brave man.\"  It is not  necessary to have faith in the rhetorical compliment, or to likewise  reject the mixture of pride and weakness attributed to Vercingetorix in  the account of Dion Cassius.  It would not be the only example of a hero  seeking yet some chance of safety in the extremity of defeat, and abasing  himself for the sake of preserving at any price a life on which fortune  might still smile.  However it be, Vercingetorix vanquished, dragged out,  after ten years' imprisonment, to grace Caesar's triumph, and put to  death immediately afterwards, lives as a glorious patriot in the pages of  that history in which Caesar appears, on this occasion, as a peevish  conqueror who took pleasure in crushing, with cruel disdain, the enemy he  had been at so much pains to conquer.    Alesia taken, and Vercingetorix a prisoner, Gaul was subdued.  Caesar,  however, had in the following year (A. U. C.  703) a campaign to make to  subjugate some peoplets who tried to maintain their local independence.  A year afterwards, again, attempts at insurrection took place in Belgica,  and towards the mouth of the Loire; but they were easily repressed; they  had no national or formidable characteristics; Caesar and his lieutenants  willingly contented themselves with an apparent submission, and in the  year 705 A. U. C.  the Roman legions, after nine years' occupation in the  conquest of Gaul, were able to depart therefrom to Italy and the East for  a plunge into civil war.            CHAPTER V.----GAUL UNDER ROMAN DOMINION.    From the conquest of Gaul by Caesar, to the establishment there of the  Franks under Clovis, she remained for more than five centuries under  Roman dominion; first under the pagan, afterwards under the Christian  empire.  In her primitive state of independence she had struggled for ten  years against the best armies and the greatest man of Rome; after five  centuries of Roman dominion she opposed no resistance to the invasion of  the barbarians, Germans, Goths, Alans, Burgundians, and Franks, who  destroyed bit by bit the Roman empire.  In this humiliation and, one  might say, annihilation of a population so independent, so active, and so  valiant at its first appearance in history, is to be seen the  characteristic of this long epoch.  It is worth while to learn and to  understand how it was.    [Illustration: Gaul subjugated by the Romans----83]    Gaul lived, during those five centuries, under very different rules and  rulers.  They may be summed up under five names, which correspond with  governments very unequal in merit and defect, in good and evil wrought  for their epoch:    1st, the Caesars from Julius to Nero (from 49 B.C. to A.D. 68);  2d, the Flavians, from Vespasian to Domitian (from A.D. 69 to 95);  3d, the Antonines, from Nerva to Marcus Aurelius (from A.D. 96 to 180);  4th, the imperial anarchy, or the thirty-nine emperors and the thirty-one  tyrants, from Commodus to Carinus and Numerian (from A.D. 180 to 284);  5th, Diocletian (from A.D. 284 to 305).    Through all these governments, and in spite of their different results  for their contemporary subjects, the fact already pointed out as the  general and definitive characteristic of that long epoch, to wit, the  moral and social decadence of Gaul as well as of the Roman empire, never  ceased to continue and spread.    On quitting conquered Gaul to become master at Rome, Caesar neglected  nothing to assure his conquest and make it conducive to the establishment  of his empire.  He formed, of all the Gallic districts that he had  subjugated, a special province which received the name of Gallia Comata  (Gaul of the long-hair), whilst the old province was called Gallia Toyata  (Gaul of the toga).  Caesar caused to be enrolled amongst his troops a  multitude of Gauls, Belgians, Arvernians, and Aquitanians, of whose  bravery he had made proof.  He even formed, almost entirely of Gauls, a  special legion called Alauda (lark), because it bore on the helmets a  lark with outspread wings, the symbol of wakefulness.  At the same time  he gave in Gallia Comata, to the towns and families that declared for  him, all kinds of favors, the rights of Roman citizenship, the title of  allies, clients, and friends, even to the extent of the Julian name, a  sign of the most powerful Roman patronage.  He had, however, in the old  Roman province, formidable enemies, especially the town of Marseilles,  which declared against him and for Pompey.  Caesar had the place besieged  by one of his lieutenants, got possession of it, caused to be delivered  over to him its vessels and treasure, and left in it a garrison of two  legions.  He established at Narbonne, Arles, Biterrce (Beziers) three  colonies of veteran legionaries devoted to his cause, and near Antipolis  (Antibes) a maritime colony called Forum Julii, nowadays Frejus, of which  he proposed to make a rival to Marseilles.  Much money was necessary to  meet the expenses of such patronage and to satisfy the troops, old and  new, of the conqueror of Gaul and Rome.  Now there was at Rome an ancient  treasure, founded more than four centuries previously by the Dictator  Camillus, when he had delivered Rome from the Gauls--a treasure reserved  for the expenses of Gallic wars, and guarded with religious respect as  sacred money.  In the midst of all discords and disorders at Rome, none  had touched it.  After his return from Gaul, Caesar one day ascended the  Capitol with his soldiers, and finding, in the temple of Saturn, the door  closed of the place where the treasure was deposited, ordered it to be  forced.  L. Metellus, tribune of the people, made strong opposition,  conjuring Caesar not to bring on the Republic the penalty of such  sacrilege: but \"the Republic has nothing to fear,\" said Caesar; \"I have  released it from its oaths by subjugating Gaul.  There are no more  Gauls.\"  He caused the door to be forced, and the treasure was abstracted  and distributed to the troops, Gallic and Roman.  Whatever Caesar may  have said, there were still Gauls, for at the same time that he was  distributing to such of them as he had turned into his own soldiers the  money reserved for the expense of fighting them, he was imposing upon  Gallia Comata, under the name of stipendium (soldier's pay), a levy of  forty millions of sesterces--a considerable amount for a devastated  country which, according to Plutarch, did not contain at that time more  than three millions of inhabitants, and almost equal to that of the  levies paid by the rest of the Roman provinces.    After Caesar, Augustus, left sole master of the Roman world, assumed in  Gaul, as elsewhere, the part of pacificator, repairer, conservator, and  organizer, whilst taking care, with all his moderation, to remain always  the master.  He divided the provinces into imperial and senatorial,  reserving to himself the entire government of the former, and leaving the  latter under the authority of the senate.  Gaul \"of the long hair,\" all  that Caesar had conquered, was imperial province.  Augustus divided it  into three provinces, Lugdunensian (Lyonese), Belgian, and Aquitanian.  He recognized therein sixty nations or distinct cityships which continued  to have themselves the government of their own affairs, according to their  traditions and manners, whilst conforming to the general laws of the  empire, and abiding under the supervision of imperial governors, charged  with maintaining everywhere, in the words of Pliny the Younger, \"the  majesty of Roman peace.\"  Luydunum (Lyons), which had been up to that  time of small importance and obscure, became the great town, the favorite  cityship and ordinary abiding-place of the emperors when they visited  Gaul.  After having held at Narbonne (27 B.C.) a meeting of  representatives from the different Gallic nations, Augustus went several  times to Lyons, and even lived there, as it appears, a pretty long while,  to superintend, no doubt, from thence, and to get into working order the  new government of Gaul.  After the departure of Augustus, his adopted son  Drusus, who had just fulfilled, in Belgica and on the Rhine, a mission at  the same time military and"]]]
