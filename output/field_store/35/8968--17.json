In fact, it is  the author's general practice, where the attendants can be induced to take  the necessary pains, to always advise this latter method.    [Illustration: FIG. 54.--SWAB FOR APPLYING MOISTURE TO THE FOOT.]    Where a dressing is relied upon by some practitioners on account of the  warmth it gives, others, even in identical cases, will depend upon the  effects of cold. This may be applied by means of what are called 'swabs.'  In their simplest form swabs may consist only of hay-bands or several  layers of thick bandage bound round the foot and coronet, and kept cool by  having water constantly poured upon them. In many cases the form of swab  depicted in Fig. 54 will be found more convenient.    When only one foot is required to be dressed, and a water-supply is  available, by far the preferable method is to attach one end of a length  of rubber tubing to the water-tap, and fasten the other just above the  coronet, allowing the water to trickle slowly over the foot. In cases where  a forced water-supply is unobtainable, and the case warrants the extra  trouble, much may be done with a medium-sized cask of water placed  somewhere over the animal, and the rubber tubing connected with that.    Where the dressing is desired to be kept applied to the sole and frog only,  there is no method more satisfactory than the shoe with plates.    [Illustration: FIG. 55.--THE SHOE WITH PLATES. _A_, The plates in position;  _B_, the plates separated from the shoe.]    [Illustration: FIG. 56.--THE QUITTOR SYRINGE.]    The plates are of metal, preferably of thin sheet iron or zinc, and are  slipped between the upper surface of the shoe and the foot after the manner  shown in Fig. 55. The plates themselves are shaped as depicted in Fig.  55, _a, b, c, a_ and _b_ curved to meet the outlines of the shoe, and _c_  shaped so as to wedge tightly over the posterior ends of the side plates,  and between them and the shoe. A distinct advantage of the plate method of  dressing is that a certain amount of pressure may be maintained on the sole  and frog, a very important consideration in connection with some of the  diseases with which we shall later deal.    When dealing with sinuous wounds of the foot, another favourite mode of  applying dressings is by means of the syringe, and no better instrument for  all cases can be found than that known as a quittor syringe (Fig. 56).    A further mode of applying dressing, and one frequently practised  in connection with the foot, is known as 'plugging.' This is almost  sufficiently indicated by its name. It consists in rolling portions of  the dressing into little cylinders, wrapped round with thin paper, and  introduced into a sinus or other position where considered necessary.      D. PLANTAR NEURECTOMY.    As a last resort in the treatment of many diseases of the foot the  operation of neurectomy is often advised. It will be wise, therefore, to  insert a description of the operation here.    _Derivation of the Word_.--For many years the operation was known simply as  'nerving' or 'unnerving,' and it was not until 1823, at the suggestion  of Dr. George Pearson, that Percival introduced the word _neurotomy_  to signify the operation with which we are now about to deal. The word  neurotomy, however, used strictly, means the act or practice of dissection  of nerves, and, when applied to the operation as practised to-day,  describes only a step in the procedure.    As the operation really consists in cutting down upon, and afterwards  excising a portion of the nerve, the modern appellation of  _neurectomy_--from the Greek _neuron_, a nerve; and _tome_, a cutting,  signifying the cutting out of a nerve or the portion of a nerve--is far  more suitable.    According as the nerve operated on is the plantar or the median, the  operation is known as plantar or median neurectomy.    _History of the Operation_.--It is to two English veterinarians that we  owe the introduction of the operation to the veterinary world. In 1819  Professor Sewell announced himself as the originator of neurotomy. This  claim was disputed by Moorcraft, who appears to have successfully  shown himself to be the real person entitled to that honour, he having  satisfactorily performed the operation on numerous animals for fully  eighteen years prior to Professor Sewell's announcement. It appears that  Moorcraft left this country for India in 1808, having practised the  operation in more or less obscurity for some six or seven years previous  to that. After his departure neurectomy, as introduced by him, either died  away in repute, or was not made by him sufficiently public to become a  matter of general knowledge. To Professor Sewell, therefore, although not  the actual originator of the operation, belongs the honour of making it  public to the veterinary profession.    In 1824, five years after Sewell's introduction, we find it practised on  the Continent by Girard. We gather, however, from the writings of Percival  and Liautard, that both in this country and on the Continent the operation  was for several years largely in the stage of experiment. Unsuitable  subjects were operated on; the work afterwards given to the animal  improperly adjusted to his altered condition; and the bad after-results of  the operation almost ignored by some, and greatly exaggerated by others.  In fact, some long time elapsed before veterinary surgeons allotted to the  operation that measure of credit which the results following it warranted.    _The Object of the Operation_ is to render the foot insensitive to pain,  and to give to an otherwise incurably lame animal a further period of  usefulness. After the operation, as time goes on, this object may become  defeated by the reunion of the divided ends of the nerve. In that case,  neurectomy must necessarily be performed again.    _The Operation_.--Two forms of neurectomy are recognised--the high  operation and the low. The low operation deals with the posterior digital  branch of the plantar nerve, and the high operation with the plantar  itself.    It is the latter operation with which we shall deal first. In our opinion  it is that most likely to be followed by satisfactory results. The area  supplied by the posterior digital is mainly the posterior portion of the  digit. Thus, unless the cause of the lameness is diagnosed with certainty  to be situated somewhere in the posterior region of the foot, section of  the posterior digital alone will not give total insensibility to pain.  Added to that, we may remember this: Below the point at which the digitals  branch off from the plantar there is always more likelihood of the part  we are attempting to render insensible being supplied by another and  adventitious branch, or a branch that, as regards its direction, is  abnormally distributed. As a last consideration, we may say that the higher  operation is the easier to perform.    Percival, in his works on lameness, has some very sage remarks to make by  way of a preliminary, and we cannot do better than quote them here. He  says:    'To command success in neurectomy three considerations demand attention:    '1. The subject must be fit and proper; in particular, the disease for  which neurectomy is performed should be suitable in kind, seat, stage, etc.    '2. The operation must be skilfully and effectually performed.    '3. The use that is made of the patient afterwards should not exceed what  his altered condition appears to have fitted him for.    'The veterinarian who is guided by considerations such as those will find  that he has restored to work horses who would otherwise have been utterly  useless. A plain and safe argument wherewith to meet the objections to  neurectomy is simply to ask the question what the animal is worth, or to  what useful purpose he can be put, that happens to be the subject of such  an operation.    'If the horse can be shown to be still serviceable and valuable, then he is  not a legitimate subject for the operation. The rule of procedure I have  laid down is to operate on no other but the _incurably lame horse_; and  whenever this has been attended to, not only has success been the more  brilliant, but indemnification from blame or reproach has been assured.'    _Preparation of the Subject_.--But little in the way of medicinal  preparation is necessary. When the animal is a gross, heavy feeder, and  carries a more than ordinary amount of cupboard, all that is needed is to  withhold his usual allowance of food for some time prior to the operation,  simply to avoid risk of rupture when casting. If considered advisable, a  dose of physic may also be administered.    To the seat of operation, however, careful attention should be given. On  the day previous to the operation the hair should be closely removed with  the clipping machines, and the skin thoroughly cleansed with warm water  and soap. After this, a bandage soaked in a 4 per cent, watery solution  of carbolic acid should be wrapped lightly round the limb, and allowed to  remain in position until the animal is cast and ready for the operation the  following morning. On removing the bandage prior to operating, the part  should again be bathed with a cold 5 per cent. solution of carbolic acid  and swabbed dry. Attention to these details will serve to leave the wound  in that favourable condition in which it heals nicely, and with the minimum  amount of trouble.    _Preliminary Steps_.--By some practitioners the operation is performed with  the animal standing, local anaesthesia having been first obtained by the use  of cocaine, or an ethyl chloride spray. There is no gainsaying the fact,  however, that the operation of neurectomy is a painful one, and that, with  most operators, success will be more fully guaranteed with the animal cast  and the limb held in a suitable position by an assistant.    The animal is thrown by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11212"],[0,"Modern India (#16)"],[1,"  the officiating clergyman, had on what looked like a red flannel  shirt. He brought his tools with him, and conducted a mysterious  ceremony, which I cannot describe, because it was too long and  complicated, and I could not make any notes. A gentleman who  had been requested to look after me attempted to explain what  it meant, as the ceremony proceeded, but his English was very  imperfect, and I lost a good deal of the show trying to clear up  his meaning. While the chief priest was going through a ritual  his deputies chanted mournful and monotonous strains in a minor  key--repetitions of the same lines over and over again. They  were praying for the favor of the gods, and their approval of  the marriage.    After the groom had endured it alone for a while the bride was  brought in by her brother-in-law, who, since the death of her  father, has been the head of the household. He was clad in a  white gauze undershirt, with short sleeves, and the ordinary  Hindu robe wrapped around his waist, and hanging down to his  bare knees. The bride had a big bunch of pearls hanging from  her upper lip, gold and silver rings and anklets upon her bare  feet, and her head was so concealed under wrappings of shawls  that she would have smothered in the hot room had not one of  her playmates gone up and removed the coverings from her face.  This playmate was a lively matron of 14 years, a fellow pupil  at the missionary school, who had been married at the age of  9, so she knew all about it, and had adopted foreign manners  and customs sufficiently to permit her to go about among the  guests, chatting with both gentlemen and ladies with perfect  self-possession. She told us all about the bride, who was her  dearest friend, received and passed around the presents as they  arrived, and took charge of the proceedings.    The bride sat down on the floor beside the husband that had been  chosen for her and timidly clasped his hand while the priests  continued chanting, stopping now and then to breathe or to anoint  the foreheads of the couple, or to throw something on the fire. There  were bowls of several kinds of food, each having its significance,  and several kinds of plants and flowers, and incense, which was  thrown into the flames. At one time the chief priest arose from  the floor, stretched his legs and read a long passage from a  book, which my escort said was the sacred writing in Sanskrit  laying down rules and regulations for the government of Hindu  wives. But the bride and groom paid very little attention to  the priests or to the ceremony. After the first embarrassment  was over they chatted familiarly with their friends, both foreign  and native, who came and squatted down beside them. The bride's  mother came quietly into the circle after a while and sat down  beside her son-in-law--a slight woman, whose face was entirely  concealed. When the performance had been going on for about an  hour four more priests appeared and took seats in the background.  When I asked my guardian their object, he replied, sarcastically,  that it was money, that they were present as witnesses, and each  of them would expect a big fee as well as a good supper.    \"Poor people get married with one priest,\" he added, \"but rich  people have to have many. It costs a lot of money to get married.\"    Every now and then parcels were brought in by servants, and handed  to the bride, who opened them with the same eagerness that American  girls show about their wedding presents, but before she had been  given half a chance to examine them they were snatched away from  her and passed around. There were enough jewels to set the groom  up in business, for all the relatives on both sides are rich,  several beautifully embroidered shawls, a copy of Tennyson's  poems, a full set of Ruskin's works, a flexible covered Bible  from the bride's school teacher, and other gifts too numerous  to mention. The ceremony soon became tedious and the crowded  room was hot and stuffy. It was an ordeal for us to stay as long  as we did, and we endured it for a couple of hours, but it was  ten times worse for the bride and groom, for they had to sit on  the floor over the fire, and couldn't even stretch their legs.  They told us that it would take four hours more to finish the  ritual. So we asked our hosts to excuse us, offered our sympathy  and congratulations to the happy couple, who laughed and joked  with us in English, while the priests continued to sing and pray.          VI    THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA    The most interesting of all the many religious sects in India are  the Parsees, the residue of one of the world's greatest creeds,  descendants of the disciples of Zoroaster, and the Persian fire  worshipers, who sought refuge in India from the persecution of  the all-conquering Mohammedans about the seventh century. They  have not increased and probably have diminished in numbers, but  have retained the faith of their fathers undefiled, which has  been described as \"the most sublime expression of religious purity  and thought except the teachings of Christ.\" It is a curious  fact, however, that although the Parsees are commercially the  most enterprising people in India, and the most highly educated,  they have never attempted to propagate or even to make known  their faith to the world. It remained for Anquetil Duperron, a  young Frenchman, a Persian scholar, to translate the Zend Avesta,  which contains the teachings of Zoroaster, and may be called  the Parsee bible. And even now the highest authority in Parsee  theology and literature is Professor Jackson, who holds the chair  of oriental languages in Columbia University, New York. At this  writing Professor Jackson is in Persia engaged upon investigations  of direct interest to the Parsees, who have the highest regard  and affection for him, and perfect confidence in the accuracy  of his treatment of their theology in which they permit him to  instruct them.    The Parsees have undoubtedly made more stir in the world in  proportion to their population than any other race. They are  a small community, and number only 94,000 altogether, of whom  76,000 reside in Bombay. They are almost without exception  industrious and prosperous, nearly all being engaged in trade and  manufacturing, and to them the city of Bombay owes the greatest  part of its wealth and commercial influence.    While the Parsees teach pure and lofty morality, and are famous  for their integrity, benevolence, good thoughts, good works and  good deeds, their method of disposing of their dead is revolting.  For, stripped of every thread of clothing, the bodies of their  nearest and dearest are exposed to dozens of hungry vultures,  which quickly tear the flesh from the bones.    In a beautiful grove upon the top of a hill overlooking the city  of Bombay and the sea, surrounded by a high, ugly wall, are the  so-called Towers of Silence, upon which these hideous birds can  always be seen, waiting for their feast. They roost upon palm  trees in the neighborhood, and, often in their flight, drop pieces  of human flesh from their beaks or their talons, which lie rotting  in the fields below. An English lady driving past the Towers of  Silence was naturally horrified when the finger of a dead man  was dropped into her carriage by one of those awful birds; and  an army officer told me, that he once picked up by the roadside  the forearm and hand of a woman which had been torn from a body  only a few hours dead and had evidently fallen during a fight  between the birds. The reservoir which stores the water supply  of Bombay is situated upon the same hill, not more than half a  mile distant, and for obvious reasons had been covered with a  roof. Some years ago the municipal authorities, having had their  attention called to possible pollution of the water, notified  the Parsees that the Towers of Silence would have to be removed  to a distance from the city, but the rich members of that faith  preferred to pay the expense of roofing over the reservoir to  abandoning what to them is not only sacred but precious ground.  The human mind can adjust itself to almost any conditions and  associations, and a cultured Parsee will endeavor to convince  you by clever arguments that their method is not only humane and  natural, but the best sanitary method ever devised of disposing  of the dead.    Funeral ceremonies are held at the residence of the dead; prayers  are offered and eulogies are pronounced. Then a procession is  formed and the hearse is preceded by priests and followed by  the male members of the family and by friends. The body is not  placed in a coffin, but is covered with rich shawls and vestments.  When the gateway of the outer temple is reached, priests who  are permanently attached to the Towers of Silence and reside  within the inclosure, meet the procession and take charge of  the body, which is first carried to a temple, where prayers are  offered, and a sacred fire, kept continually burning there, is  replenished. While the friends and mourners are engaged in worship,  Nasr Salars, as the attendants are called, take the bier to the  ante-room of one of the towers. There are five, of circular shape,  with walls forty feet high, perfectly plain, and whitewashed.  The largest is 276 feet in circumference and cost $150,000. The  entrance is about fifteen or twenty feet from the ground and is  reached by a flight of steps. The inside plan of the building  resembles a circular gridiron gradually depressed toward the  center, at which there is a pit, five feet in diameter. From  this pit cement walks radiate like the spokes of a wheel, and  between them are three series of compartments extending around  the entire tower. Those nearest the center are about four feet  long, two feet wide and six inches deep. The next series are a  little larger, and the third, larger still, and they are intended  respectively for men, women and children."]]]
