He and the boy  were engaged in preparing the steam man and wagon for starting, when  the excited words drew their attention, and seeing that a fight was  imminent, Baldy advanced to where they stood and said:    'Not another word, or skulpme ef I don't hammer both of you till  thar's nothin left o' you.'    This was unequivocal language, and neither of the combatants  misunderstood it. All belligerent manifestations ceased at once, and  they turned to in assisting in the preparations for moving.    When all four were seated in the wagon, with their necessary baggage  about them, it was found that there was comparatively little room for  the wood. When they had stored all that they could well carry, it was  found that there was hardly enough to last them twelve hours, so that  there was considerable risk run from this single fact.    The steam man, however, stepped off with as much ease as when drawing  the wagon with a single occupant. The boy let on enough of steam to  keep up a rattling pace, and to give the assurance that they were  progressing home ward in the fastest manner possible.    Toward the middle of the afternoon a storm suddenly came up and the  rain poured in torrents.    As the best they could do, they took refuge in a grove, where, by  stretching the canvas over themselves and the steam man, they managed  to keep free from the wet.    The steam man was not intended to travel during stormy weather, and so  they allowed him to rest.                            CHAPTER XVIII. THE ENCAMPMENT.    THE STORM proved the severest which the steam man had encountered  since leaving St. Louis, and it put an effectual veto on his travels  during its continuance, and for a short time afterward.    The prairie was found so soft and slippery that they were compelled to  lie by until the sun had hardened it somewhat, when they once more  resumed their journey.    As they now had thousands of dollars in their possession, and as all  sorts of characters were found on the western plains, it may be said  that none of the company ever felt easy.    Baldy Bicknell, the trapper, from his extensive experience and  knowledge of the West, was the guide and authority on all matters  regarding their travels. He generally kept watch during the night,  obtaining what sleep he could through the day. The latter, however,  was generally very precarious, as at sight of every horseman or cloud  of smoke, they generally awakened him, so as to be sure and commit no  serious error.    As the steam man would in all probability attract an attention that  might prove exceedingly perilous to the gold in their possession, the  trapper concluded it prudent to avoid the regular emigrant routes.  Accordingly they turned well to the northward, it being their purpose  to strike the Missouri, where they would be pretty sure of  intercepting some steamer. Reaching such a place they would unjoint  and take apart the steam man, packing it up in such a manner that no  one could suspect its identity, and embark for St. Louis.    While this relieved them of the danger from their own race, it  increased the probability of an attack upon the Indians, who scarcely  ever seemed out of sight.    Their watchfulness, however, was constant, and it was due to this  fact, more than any other, that they escaped attack at night for the  greater part of their return journey.    Their position in the wagon was so cramped, that the party frequently  became excessively wearied, and springing out, trotted and walked for  miles alongside the tireless steam giant. Water was abundant, but  several times they were put to great inconvenience to obtain wood. On  three occasions they were compelled to halt for half a day in order to  obtain the necessary supply.    Once the steam man came to a dead standstill in the open prairie, and  narrowly escaped blowing up. A hasty examination upon the part of the  inventor, revealed the fact that a leak had occurred in the tank, and  every drop had run out..    This necessitated the greatest work of all, as water was carried the  better part of a mile, and nearly an entire day consumed before enough  steam could be raised to induce him to travel to the river, to procure  it himself, while the miners acted as convoys.    Late one afternoon, they reached a singular formation in the prairie.  It was so rough and uneven that they proceeded with great difficulty  and at a slow rate of speed. While advancing in this manner, they  found they had unconsciously entered a small narrow valley, the bottom  of which was as level as a ground floor. The sides contracted until  less than a hundred feet separated them, while they rose to the hight  of some eight or ten feet, and the bottom remained compact and firm,  making it such easy traveling for the steam man, that the company  followed down the valley, at a slow pace, each, however, feeling some  misgiving as to the propriety of the course.    'It runs in the right direction,' said young Brainerd, 'and if it only  keeps on as it began, it will prove a very handy thing for us.'    'Hyar's as afeared it ain't goin' to keep on in that style,' remarked  Baldy; 'howsumever, you can go ahead awhile longer.'    'Naow, that's what I call real queer,' remarked Ethan Hopkins, who was  stretching his legs by walking alongside the steamer.    'And it's meself that thinks the same,' added Mickey, puffing away at  his short black pipe. 'I don't understand it, as me father obsarved  when they found fault with him for breaking another man's head.'    'Ef we git into trouble, all we've got ta do is to back out,' remarked  Baldy, as a sort of apology for continuing his advance.    'This fellow doesn't know how to go backward,' said Johnny, 'but if it  prove necessary, we can manage to turn him round.'    'All right, go ahead.'    At the same moment, the limber Yankee sprung into the wagon, and the  steam man started ahead at a speed which was as fast as was prudent.    However, this delightful means of progress was brought to an  unexpected standstill, by the sudden and abrupt termination of the  valley. It ended completely as though it were an uncompleted canal,  the valley rising so quickly to the level of the prairie, that there  was no advancing any further, nor turning, nor in fact was there any  possible way of extricating themselves from the difficulty, except by  working the steam man around, and withdrawing by the same path that  they had entered by.    'Well, here we are' remarked the boy, as they came to a standstill,  'and what is to be done?'    'Get out of it,' was the reply of Hopkins, who advanced several yards  further, until he came up on the prairie again, so as to make sure of  the exact contour of the ground.    'Did yer ever try to make the thing go up hill?' asked the trapper.    Young Brainerd shook his head. 'Impossible! he would fall over on us,  the minute it was attempted. When I was at work at first making him,  what do you think was the hardest thing for me to do?'    'Make him go, I s'pose.'    'That was difficult, but it was harder work to balance him, that is, so  when he lifted up one foot he wouldn't immediately fall over on the  same side. I got it fixed after a while, so that he ran as evenly and  firmly as an engine, but I didn't fix upon any plan by which he could  ascend or descend a hill.'    'Can't you make him do it?'    'Not until he is made over again. I would be afraid to attempt to walk  him up a moderate inclination, and know it would be sure destruction  to start him up such a steep bank at that.'    'Then we must work him round, I s'pose.'    'There is nothing else that can be done.'    'Let's at it, then.'    This proved as difficult a job as they imagined. The steam man was so  heavy that it was impossible to lift him, but he was shied around as  much as possible; and, by the time he had walked across the valley he  had half turned round.    He was then coaxed and worked back a short distance, when, with the  'leverage' thus gained, the feat was completed, and the steam man  stood with his face turned, ready to speed backward the moment that  the word might be given.    By this time, however, the day was gone, and darkness was settling  over the prairie. Quite a brisk breeze was blowing, and, as the  position of the party was sheltered against this annoyance, Hopkins  proposed that they should remain where they were until morning.    'We couldn't get a better place,' said Johnny Brainerd, who was quite  taken with the idea.    'It's a good place and it's a bad one,' replied the trapper, who had  not yet made up his mind upon the point.    They inquired what he meant by calling it a bad place.    'Ef a lot of the varmints should find we're hyar, don't you see what a  purty fix they'd have us in?'    'It would be something like the same box in which we caught them in  Wolf Ravine,' said young Brainerd.    'Jist the same, perzactly.'    'Not the same, either,' said Hopkins; 'we've got a better chance of  getting out than they had. We can jump into the wagon and travel,  while they can't; there's the difference.'    'S'pose they git down thar ahead of us, how ar' we goin' to git away  from them then?    'Run over them.'    'Don't know whether the younker has fixed he engine so it'll run over'  the skunks, ef it doesn't run up hill.'    'It can be made to do that, I think,' laughed young Brainerd.    'Afore we stay hyar, I'll take a look round to make sure that thar's  some show for us.'    The trapper ascended the bank, and, while his companions were occupied  in their preparations for encamping, he examined the whole horizon and  intervening space, so far as the human eye was capable of doing it.  Finding nothing suspicious, he announced to his companions that they  would remain where they were until morning.                         CHAPTER XIX. THE DOINGS OF A NIGHT.    IT WAS soon found that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7509"],[0,"The Logbooks of the Lady Nelson (#15)"],[1,"lson's previous  voyage or some French sailor bestowed the name Capuchin upon Flinders  Island, and Murray wrote it on his chart, although it was afterwards  erased from the maps and replaced at first by the name of Great Island  and later by that of Flinders Island.* (* The Sydney Gazette of March  31st, 1831, in giving the names of the Furneaux Group transfers the name  to Babel Islands, i.e. \"Babel Islands or Capisheens as called by the  sealers,\" but, as Murray's Chart, page 146, and Sydney Gazettes of an  earlier period will show, at first Flinders Island alone was called  Capuchin.)    Leaving Diana Bay on November 25th Murray saw the easternmost members of  the Kent Group and steered through the passage which separates the  principal islands and which was named in his honour, Murray's Passage.  Flinders had passed through the same passage, when he discovered the  group, in the Francis in 1798, and named a rock to the south of it the  Judgment Rock \"from its resemblance to an elevated seat.\"* (* The  Australian Sailing Directory, Admiralty.)    After surveying the Kent Group, Murray started to carry out his survey of  Western Port and Port Phillip. On December 5th he sighted Sir Roger  Curtis's Island and on the 7th reached Western Port where he was detained  by bad weather until the first week in January. On January 5th* (* The  logbooks were kept in nautical fashion, the day beginning at noon before  the civil reckoning, so that Port Phillip was really discovered on the  afternoon of Monday, January 4th, 1802. According to the Admiralty  librarian the change from nautical to civil reckoning in the logs did not  take place until 1805.) as the vessel ran along the Victorian coast  towards Port Phillip dense smoke from native fires hid the land from  view. At 3 P.M. the smoke had cleared away and Bowen, who was at the  masthead, espied an opening in the land ahead which \"had the appearance  of a harbour.\" Keeping close in for it Murray saw inside a fine smooth  sheet of water. An island lay at the entrance but the waves were breaking  high on the rocks so the brig was hauled off and taken out to sea. Murray  then steered to King Island deciding to return again later to explore the  newly discovered harbour. He surveyed the east coast of King Island from  Cape Farewell to Seal Bay. Some sea elephants were lying on the beach of  the bay that he first entered, and this was named Sea Elephant Bay.* (*  Murray's survey of King Island was an important one and Governor King  refers to it as \"giving to the British priority of discovery over the  French ships\" when eleven months afterwards Baudin came to the island.)  The following pages describe Murray's exploration of King Island and of  his first sight of Port Phillip.    MURRAY'S LOG.    H.M.A. SURVEYING VESSEL LADY NELSON ON DISCOVERY. LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER  JOHN MURRAY.    Sydney Cove to Bass Strait.    \"Thursday, 12th November 1801. Working out of ye Heads at 1 P.M.--at 2  P.M. ye South Head of Port Jackson bore north-north-west 11 miles. At 4  P.M. ye weather began to look squally and black from ye south-west with  now and then lightning...At 5 it thundered and the lightning  increased...During night fresh winds and a heavy sea up; in the morning  no land in sight.    \"Friday, 13th November. Fresh winds and clear with heavy tumbling  sea...At sundown Mount Dromedary 9 or 10 leagues N.W.W. During night  unsettled weather and a confused sea. At noon Cape How bore West distance  7 or 8 leagues.    \"Saturday, 14th November. Light airs inclinable to calm, a very heavy sea  from south-west. At sundown Cape How bore north-west distant about 7  leagues...We hauled in for the land this morning, the Longitude by  Governor King's timekeeper was 149 degrees 30 minutes 45 seconds east,  Latitude by anticipation 38 degrees 00 minutes 00 seconds south. At noon  calm fine weather. Latitude observed 38 degrees 06 minutes 43 seconds  south.    \"Sunday, 15th November. Moderate fine weather and smooth water...At 9  A.M. we had a curious squall at every point of the compass, it did not  blow very hard and seemed to settle in the south-east quarter.    \"Monday, 16th November. At half-past 5 P.M. saw a thunder squall rising  in western quarter. The squall passed over the land and thundered a good  deal with much lightning, at half-past 7 it took a north-west turn and at  8 P.M. passed over our heads, though with no great deal of wind...In the  morning made sail...Latitude 38 degrees 32 minutes south.    \"Thursday, 19th November. Moderate and hazy. At 6 A.M. saw Kent's Group  bearing south-west distances 8 or 9 leagues--their appearance was like a  great number of small islands being nearly south-east and north-west; at  8 A.M. the easternmost island of Kent's Group and the largest bore  south-south-west distance 7 or 8 leagues. At 9 A.M. the whole chain of  islands, 13 in number, bore from south by west to west the large island  as above.    \"Friday, 20th November. Light variable winds and fine weather. Kept  working up to the land but were surprised to find that instead of being a  small group of islands, ye body of the land was very large and whatever  appeared as islands began to connect itself into one island, the latitude  not agreeing with Lieutenant Flinders, concluded it could not be Kent's  Group. Kept working up to it and by daylight was within 5 miles of ye  northernmost island, passed close to it and seeing an immense number of  birds on it sent the boat on shore to procure some; in a short time after  this I saw a smoke arise from the small island just passed, sent ye boat  and ye first mate there where they found two men, one woman and a child,  of Henry Kable's employ; assisted them as well as we could--by noon  worked into a good harbour and moored between Storehouse and Cat  Island--got the Latitude by going on shore 39 degrees 57 minutes 46  seconds south. When moored, the Grand Capshine bore west-north-west  distant 1/2 mile--Cat Island bore north by east 1/4 mile and Storehouse  Island south-east quarter of a mile. Cape Barren the east point south 1/2  east distant 25 miles.    \"Saturday, 21st November. Employed taking on stone for ballast. Carpenter  fitting places for sweeps to row in and on the longboat. P.M. Broke  Farmer Barnes for contempt and disobedience of orders. Rated Robert  Warren boatswain's mate in his room. A.M. Sent the first mate and a party  of hands (with one of the people found here) and some dogs to get  kangaroo being informed that great plenty was to be found in the country.    \"Sunday, 22nd November. The first officer and his party returned on  board; they shot 2 wambucks,* (* Presumably wombats.) a kangaroo, a  porcupine, a swan and some birds--in the evening sent the second mate and  some hands on shore to get mutton-birds, and eggs. On account of the  great plenty of fresh provisions served no salt meat this day. I went and  measured a base line from the south end of Storehouse Island due East and  West 2 miles to a point on ye Grand Capshine and from thence surveyed  this harbour more for the sake of practice than any use it could be, this  place being well-known by the name Diana Bay.    \"Monday, 23rd November. At 6 P.M. sent party on shore with the first mate  to procure mutton-birds for officers and people. At 9 P.M. the officer  and party returned on board, having got near 100 birds and some eggs. As  I was at supper, I received the following note from R.B. Wood my clerk:    \"'SIR,--Under the unfortunate situation in which I am placed as a  prisoner and a convict it may appear strange my presumption in observing  that something serious I wish to communicate to you. Pardon me saying  that secrecy is requisite--and that after you have supped and alone will  be best. I am, Sir, Your humble servant,    \"'R.B. WOOD.'    \"On receiving this, a little time after, I sent for him and he informed  me that he had seen Mark Clark, soldier, and Robert Warren, who was only  two days ago rated boatswain's mate, pumping off spirits from a cask in  the hold; that he suspected this business had been carried on for some  time and believed more than those might be concerned. In addition John  Johnston, cabin servant, informed me that he had seen a number of the  people at different times half drunk when on their watch below; in  consequence of these circumstances I turned the hands on deck and read  the Articles of War to them, put Mark Clark, Robert Warren and Farmer  Barnes in irons, he being drunk; and in the morning I hoisted on deck all  the casks of spirits, overhauled them and found one with the bung just  out and about 4 1/2 inches dry in it; nailed lead over the bung and  tossed them below again. On questioning Clark on this affair he confessed  that he and Warren had pumped spirits out of the cask last night, and  George Yates informed me that Warren had made a practice of it for some  time back. On investigating the matter closer it appeared that Barnes had  nothing to do with it. I accordingly released Barnes and again rated him  boatswain's mate--turned the hands up and punished Robert Warren with  four dozen lashes for robbery, drunkenness, etc., and Mark Clark with one  dozen lashes only as it appeared that he had been prompted to this when  drunk.    \"Tuesday, 24th November. First and middle parts fine weather and mostly  calm, latter hazy. Half-past 9 anchor and made sail out between the Grand  Capshine and Cat Island, hoisted up our gig and stowe her. At 10 A.M. Cat  Island bore south-east distant 5 miles and the peak of the Grand Capshine  south-south-east distant 6 miles. At noon the Grand Capshine bore  south-east distant 16 or 17 miles and the west end of ye Sisters west by  south distant 8 or 9 miles.
