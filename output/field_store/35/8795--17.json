I used once to think  there was, but I don't now. It used to seem to me that things rusted  out, but now it appears as if they were only misplaced, or overlaid,  or stowed away like where you can't find them; but depend on it, when  once there, they remain for ever. How often you are asked, \"Don't you  recollect this or that?\" and you answer, \"No, I never heard, or saw  it, or read it,\" as the case may be. And when the time, and place, and  circumstances are told you, you say, \"Stop a bit, I do now mind  something about it, warn't it so and so, or this way, or that way,\"  and finally up it comes, all fresh to your recollection. Well, until  you get the clue given you, or the key note is struck, you are ready  to take your oath you never heard of it afore. Memory has many cells:  Some of them ain't used much, and dust and cobwebs get about them, and  you can't tell where the hinge is, or can't easily discarn the secret  spring; but open it once, and whatever is stowed away there is as safe  and sound as ever. I have a good many capital stories poked away in  them cubby-holes, that I can't just lay my hand on when I want to; but  now and then, when looking for something else, I stumble upon them by  accident. Tell you what, as for forgettin' a thing tee-totally, I  don't believe there is sich a thing in natur. But to get back to my  story.    \"Miss,\" sais I, \"I can't just at this present moment call to mind a  story to please you. Some of them are about hosses, or clocks, or  rises taken out of folks, or dreams, or courtships, or ghosts, or what  not; but few of them will answer, for they are either too short or too  long.\"    \"Oh,\" says Catherine Fraser, \"tell us a courtship; I dare say you will  make great fun of it.\"    \"No, no,\" says Jessie, \"tell us a ghost story. Oh! I delight in them.\"    \"Oh,\" said Janet, \"tell us about a dream. I know one myself which came  out as correct as provin' a sum.\"    \"That's it, Miss Janet,\" said I; \"do you tell me that story, please,  and it's hard if I can't find one that will please you in return for  it.\"    \"Yes, do, dear,\" said Jessie; \"tell Mr Slick that story, for it's a  true one, and I should like to hear what he thinks of it, or how he  can account for it.\"    \"Well,\" said Janet, \"you must excuse me, Mr Slick, for any mistakes I  make, for I don't speak very good English, and I can hardly tell a  story all through in that language.    \"I have a brother that lives up one of the branches of the Buctouche  River in New Brunswick. He bought a tract of land there four or five  years ago, on which there was a house and barn, and about a hundred  acres of cleared land. He made extensive improvements on it, and went  to a great expense in clearing up the stumps, and buying stock and  farming implements, and what not. One season, between plantin' and  harvest, he run short of money for his common daily use, and to pay  some little debts he owed, and he was very dull about it. He said he  knew he could come here and borrow it from father, but he didn't like  to be away from home so long, and hardly knew how the family was to  get on or to pay the wages till his return, so it was agreed that I  was to go the next Monday in a vessel bound for Halifax and bring him  what he wanted.    \"At that time, he had a field back in the woods he was cultivating.  Between that and the front on the river, was a poor sand flat covered  with spruce, birch, and poplar, and not worth the expense of bringing  to for the plough. The road to the back field ran through this wood  land. He was very low-spirited about his situation, for he said if he  was to borrow the money of a merchant, he would require a mortgage on  his place, and perhaps sell it before he knew where he was. Well, that  night he woke up his wife, and said to her--    \"'Mary,' said he, 'I have had a very curious dream just now. I dreamed  that as I was going out to the back lot with the oxcart, I found a  large sum of money all in dollars in the road there.'    \"'Well,' says Mary, 'I wish it was true, John, but it is too good news  for us. The worriment we have had about money lately has set you a  dreaming. Janet sails on Monday, she will soon be back, and then it  will all be right; so go to sleep again, dear.'    \"Well, in the morning, when he and his wife got up, he never spoke or  thought any more about the dream, but as soon as breakfast was over,  he and his man yoked up the oxen, put them to the cart, and lifted the  harrow into it, and started for the field. The servant drove the team,  and John walked behind with his head down, a turning over in his mind  whether he couldn't sell something off the farm to keep matters  a-goin' till I should return, when all at once, as they were passing  through the wood, he observed that there was a line of silver dollars  turned up by one of the wheels of the cart, and continued for the  space of sixty feet and then ceased.    \"The moment he saw the money he thought of his dream, and he was so  overjoyed that he was on the point of calling out to the man to stop,  but he thought it was more prudent as they were alone in the woods to  say nothing about it. So he walked on, and joined the driver, and kept  him in talk for awhile. And then, as if he had suddenly thought of  something, said, 'Jube, do you proceed to the field and go to work  till I come. I shall have to go to the house for a short time.'    \"Well, as soon as he got out of sight of the cart, off he ran home as  hard as he could lay legs to it, only stopping to take up a handful of  the coins to make sure they were real.    \"'Mary, Mary,' sais he, 'the dream has come true; I have found the  money--see here is some of it; there is no mistake;' and he threw a  few pieces down on the hearth and rung them. 'They are genuine Spanish  crowns. Do you and Janet bring the market-basket, while I go for a  couple of hoes, and let us gather it all up.'    \"Well, sure enough, when we came to the place he mentioned, there was  the wheel-track full of dollars. He and I hoed each side of the rut,  which seemed to be in a sort of yellow powder, like the dust of rotten  wood, and got out all we could find. We afterwards tried under the  opposite wheel, and behind and before the rut, but could find no more,  and when we got home we counted it, and found we had eighty-two  pounds, five shillings.    \"'Well, this is a God-send, Mary, ain't it?' said brother; and she  threw her arms round his neck, and cried for joy as she kissed him.\"    \"Which way,\" said I, \"show me, Miss, how she did it, only you may  laugh instead of cry if you like.\"    \"Not being a wife,\" said she, with great quietness, \"I cannot show you  myself, but you may imagine it, it will do just as well, or dream it,  and that will do better.    \"Well, John was a scrupulous man, and he was determined to restore the  money, if he could find an owner for it; but he could hear of no one  who had lost any, nor any tradition in that place that any one ever  had done so since the first settlement of the country. All that he  could discover was, that about forty years before, an old Frenchman  had lived somewhere thereabouts alone, in the midst of the woods. Who  he was, or what became of him, nobody knew; all he could hear was,  that a party of lumbermen had, some years afterwards, found his house  amidst a second growth of young wood that wholly concealed it, and  that it contained his furniture, cooking utensils, and trunks, as he  had left them. Some supposed he had been devoured by bears or wolves;  others, that he had been lost in the woods; and some, that he had died  by his own hands.    \"On hearing this, John went to examine his habitation, or the remains  of it, and he found that about four acres around it were covered with  the second growth, as it is called, which was plainly to be  distinguished from the forest, as the trees were not only not so large  or so old as the neighbouring ones, but, as is always the case, were  of a different description of wood altogether. On a careful inspection  of the spot where he found the money, it appeared that the wheel had  passed lengthways along an enormous old decayed pine, in the hollow of  which he supposed the money must have been hid; and when the tree  fell, the dollars had rolled along its centre fifty feet or more, and  remained there until the wood was rotten, and had crumbled into dust.    \"There, Sir, there is my story: it is a true one, I assure you, for I  was present at the time. What do you think of it?\"    \"Well,\" sais I, \"if he had never heard a rumour, nor had any reason to  suppose that the money had been hid there, why it was a singular  thing, and looks very much like a--\"    \"Like a what?\" said she.    \"Like a supply that one couldn't count upon a second time, that's  all.\"    \"It's a dream that was fulfilled though,\" she said; \"and that don't  often happen, does it?\"1      1 The names of the persons and river are alone changed in this  extraordinary story. The actors are still living, and are persons of  undoubted veracity and respectability.      \"Unless,\" sais I, \"a young lady was to dream now that she was a going  to be married to a certain person, and that does often come true. Do  you--\"    \"Oh, nonsense,\" said she. \"Come, do tell us your story now, you know  you promised me you would if I related mine.\"    \"Yes,\" said Miss Jessie; \"come now, Mr Slick, that's a good man, do?\"    Sais I, \"Miss, I will give you my book instead, and that will tell you  a hundred of them.\"    \"Yes, but when will you give it to me?\" she replied.    \"To-morrow,\" said I, \"as soon as I go on board. But mind, there is one  condition.\" And I said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6124"],[0,"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (#15)"],[1," it were but for your pride-sake; for  the family will think you are grieving to leave the house. Then, sir,  said I, I will try to convince them of the contrary, as well as your  honour; for I will endeavour to be more cheerful while I stay, for that  very reason.    Well, replied he, I will set this down by itself, as the first time that  ever what I had advised had any weight with you. And I will add, said  I, as the first advice you have given me of late, that was fit to be  followed.--I wish said he, (I am almost ashamed to write it, impudent  gentleman as he is!) I wish I had thee as quick another way, as thou art  in thy repartees--And he laughed, and I snatched my hand from him, and I  tripped away as fast as I could. Ah! thought I, married? I am sure it is  time you were married, or, at this rate, no honest maiden ought to live  with you.    Why, dear father and mother, to be sure he grows quite a rake! How easy  it is to go from bad to worse, when once people give way to vice!    How would my poor lady, had she lived, have grieved to see it! but may  be he would have been better then! Though it seems he told Mrs. Jervis,  he had an eye upon me in his mother's life-time; and he intended to let  me know as much, by the bye, he told her! Here is shamelessness for you!  Sure the world must be near at an end! for all the gentlemen about are  as bad as he almost, as far as I can hear!--And see the fruits of  such bad examples! There is 'Squire Martin in the grove, has had three  lyings-in, it seems, in his house, in three months past; one by himself;  and one by his coachman; and one by his woodman; and yet he has turned  none of them away. Indeed, how can he, when they but follow his own vile  example? There is he, and two or three more such as he, within ten miles  of us, who keep company, and hunt with our fine master, truly; and I  suppose he is never the better for their examples. But, Heaven bless me,  say I, and send me out of this wicked house!    But, dear father and mother, what sort of creatures must the womenkind  be, do you think, to give way to such wickedness? Why, this it is that  makes every one be thought of alike: And, alack-a-day! what a world we  live in! for it is grown more a wonder that the men are resisted, than  that the women comply. This, I suppose, makes me such a sauce-box, and  bold-face, and a creature, and all because I won't be a sauce-box and  bold-face indeed.    But I am sorry for these things; one don't know what arts and stratagems  men may devise to gain their vile ends; and so I will think as well as  I can of these poor undone creatures, and pity them. For you see, by my  sad story, and narrow escapes, what hardships poor maidens go through,  whose lot it is to go out to service, especially to houses where there  is not the fear of God, and good rule kept by the heads of the family.    You see I am quite grown grave and serious; indeed it becomes the  present condition of Your dutiful DAUGHTER.          LETTER XXVIII      DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    John says you wept when you read my last letter, that he carried. I am  sorry you let him see that; for they all mistrust already how matters  are, and as it is no credit that I have been attempted, though it is  that I have resisted; yet I am sorry they have cause to think so evil of  my master from any of us.    Mrs. Jervis has made up her accounts with Mr. Longman, and will stay in  her place. I am glad of it, for her own sake, and for my master's; for  she has a good master of him; so indeed all have, but poor me--and he  has a good housekeeper in her.    Mr. Longman, it seems, took upon him to talk to my master, how faithful  and careful of his interests she was, and how exact in her accounts;  and he told him, there was no comparison between her accounts and Mrs.  Jewkes's, at the Lincolnshire estate.    He said so many fine things, it seems, of Mrs. Jervis, that my master  sent for her in Mr. Longman's presence, and said Pamela might come along  with her; I suppose to mortify me, that I must go while she was to stay:  But as, when I go away, I am not to go with her, nor was she to go with  me; so I did not matter it much; only it would have been creditable to  such a poor girl, that the housekeeper would bear me company, if I went.    Said he to her, Well, Mrs. Jervis, Longman says you have made up your  accounts with him with your usual fidelity and exactness. I had a good  mind to make you an offer of continuing with me, if you can be a little  sorry for your hasty words, which, indeed, were not so respectful as  I have deserved at your hands. She seemed at a sad loss what to say,  because Mr. Longman was there, and she could not speak of the occasion  of those words, which was me.    Indeed, said Mr. Longman, I must needs say before your face, that since  I have known my master's family, I have never found such good management  in it, nor so much love and harmony neither. I wish the Lincolnshire  estate was as well served!--No more of that, said my master; but Mrs.  Jervis may stay, if she will: and here, Mrs. Jervis, pray accept of  this, which at the close of every year's accounts I will present you  with, besides your salary, as long as I find your care so useful and  agreeable. And he gave her five guineas.--She made him a low courtesy,  and thanking him, looked to me, as if she would have spoken to me.    He took her meaning, I believe; for he said,--Indeed I love to encourage  merit and obligingness, Longman; but I can never be equally kind to  those who don't deserve it at my hands, as to those who do; and then he  looked full on me. Longman, continued he, I said that girl might come  in with Mrs. Jervis, because they love to be always together. For Mrs.  Jervis is very good to her, and loves her as well as if she was her  daughter. But else--Mr. Longman, interrupting him, said, Good to Mrs.  Pamela! Ay, sir, and so she is, to be sure! But every body must be good  to her; for----    He was going on: but my master said, No more, no more, Mr. Longman. I  see old men are taken with pretty young girls, as well as other folks;  and fair looks hide many a fault, where a person has the art to behave  obligingly. Why, and please your honour, said Mr. Longman, every  body--and was going on, I believe, to say something more in my praise,  but he interrupted him, and said, Not a word more of this Pamela. I  can't let her stay, I'll assure you; not only for her own freedom of  speech, but her letter-writing of all the secrets of my family. Ay, said  the good old man, I am sorry for that too! But, sir,--No more, I say,  said my master; for my reputation is so well known, (mighty fine,  thought I!) that I care not what any body writes or says of me: But to  tell you the truth, (not that it need go further,) I think of changing  my condition soon; and, you know, young ladies of birth and fortune will  choose their own servants, and that's my chief reason why Pamela can't  stay. As for the rest, said he, the girl is a good sort of body,  take her altogether; though I must needs say, a little pert, since my  mother's death, in her answers, and gives me two words for one; which I  can't bear; nor is there reason I should, you know, Longman. No, to be  sure, sir, said he: but 'tis strange, methinks, she should be so mild  and meek to every one of us in the house, and forget herself so, where  she should shew most respect! Very true, Mr. Longman, said he, but so it  is, I'll assure you; and it was from her pertness, that Mrs. Jervis and  I had the words: And I should mind it the less, but that the girl (there  she stands, I say it to her face) has wit and sense above her years, and  knows better.    I was in great pain to say something, but yet I knew not what, before  Mr. Longman; and Mrs. Jervis looked at me, and walked to the window to  hide her concern for me. At last, I said, It is for you, sir, to say  what you please; and for me only to say, God bless your honour!    Poor Mr. Longman faltered in his speech, and was ready to cry. Said my  insulting master to me, Why, pr'ythee, Pamela, now, shew thyself as thou  art, before Longman. Can'st not give him a specimen of that pertness  which thou hast exercised upon me sometimes?    Did he not, my dear father and mother, deserve all the truth to be told?  Yet I overcame myself so far, as to say, Well, your honour may play upon  a poor girl, that you know can answer you, but dare not.    Why, pr'ythee now, insinuator, said he, say the worst you can before  Longman and Mrs. Jervis. I challenge the utmost of thy impertinence:  and as you are going away, and have the love of every body, I would be  a little justified to my family, that you have no reason to complain  of hardships from me, as I have pert saucy answers from you, besides  exposing me by your letters.    Surely, sir, said I, I am of no consequence equal to this, in your  honour's family, that such a great gentleman as you, should need to  justify yourself about me. I am glad Mrs. Jervis stays with your honour;  and I know I have not deserved to stay: and, more than that, I don't  desire to stay.    Ads-bobbers! said Mr. Longman, and ran to me; don't say so, don't say  so, dear Mrs. Pamela! We all love you dearly: and pray down of your  knees, and ask his honour pardon, and we will all become pleaders in a  body, and I, and Mrs. Jervis too, at the head of it, to beg his honour's  pardon, and to continue you, at least, till his honour marries.--No, Mr.  Longman, said I, I cannot ask; nor will I stay, if I might. All I desire  is, to return to my poor father and mother: and though I love you all, I  won't stay.--O well-a-day, well-a-day! said the good old man, I did not  expect this!--When I had got matters thus far, and had made all up for  Mrs. Jervis, I was in hopes to have got a double holiday of joy for all  the family, in your pardon too. Well, said my master, this is a little  specimen of what I told you,"]]]
