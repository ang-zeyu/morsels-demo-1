The point of  character which, beyond any other, fits the people of this country for  representative government, is that they have almost universally the  contrary characteristic. They are very jealous of any attempt to  exercise power over them not sanctioned by long usage and by their own  opinion of right; but they in general care very little for the  exercise of power over others. Not having the smallest sympathy with  the passion for governing, while they are but too well acquainted with  the motives of private interest from which that office is sought, they  prefer that it should be performed by those to whom it comes without  seeking, as a consequence of social position. If foreigners understood  this, it would account to them for some of the apparent contradictions  in the political feelings of Englishmen; their unhesitating readiness  to let themselves be governed by the higher classes, coupled with so  little personal subservience to them, that no people are so fond of  resisting authority when it oversteps certain prescribed limits, or so  determined to make their rulers always remember that they will only be  governed in the way they themselves like best. Place-hunting,  accordingly, is a form of ambition to which the English, considered  nationally, are almost strangers. If we except the few families or  connections of whom official employment lies directly in the way,  Englishmen's views of advancement in life take an altogether different  direction--that of success in business or in a profession. They have  the strongest distaste for any mere struggle for office by political  parties or individuals; and there are few things to which they have a  greater aversion than to the multiplication of public employments; a  thing, on the contrary, always popular with the bureaucracy-ridden  nations of the Continent, who would rather pay higher taxes than  diminish, by the smallest fraction, their individual chances of a  place for themselves or their relatives, and among whom a cry for  retrenchment never means abolition of offices, but the reduction of  the salaries of those which are too considerable for the ordinary  citizen to have any chance of being appointed to them.        Chapter V--Of the Proper Functions of Representative Bodies.      In treating of representative government, it is above all necessary to  keep in view the distinction between its idea or essence, and the  particular forms in which the idea has been clothed by accidental  historical developments, or by the notions current at some particular  period.    The meaning of representative government is, that the whole people, or  some numerous portion of them, exercise through deputies periodically  elected by themselves the ultimate controlling power, which, in every  constitution, must reside somewhere. This ultimate power they must  possess in all its completeness. They must be masters, whenever they  please, of all the operations of government. There is no need that the  constitutional law should itself give them this mastery. It does not  in the British Constitution. But what it does give practically amounts  to this: the power of final control is as essentially single, in a  mixed and balanced government, as in a pure monarchy or democracy.  This is the portion of truth in the opinion of the ancients, revived  by great authorities in our own time, that a balanced constitution is  impossible. There is almost always a balance, but the scales never  hang exactly even. Which of them preponderates is not always apparent  on the face of the political institutions. In the British  Constitution, each of the three co-ordinate members of the sovereignty  is invested with powers which, if fully exercised, would enable it to  stop all the machinery of government. Nominally, therefore, each is  invested with equal power of thwarting and obstructing the others; and  if, by exerting that power, any of the three could hope to better its  position, the ordinary course of human affairs forbids us to doubt  that the power would be exercised. There can be no question that the  full powers of each would be employed defensively if it found itself  assailed by one or both of the others. What, then, prevents the same  powers from being exerted aggressively? The unwritten maxims of the  Constitution--in other words, the positive political morality of the  country; and this positive political morality is what we must look to  if we would know in whom the really supreme power in the Constitution  resides.    By constitutional law, the crown can refuse its assent to any act of  Parliament, and can appoint to office and maintain in it any minister,  in opposition to the remonstrances of Parliament. But the  constitutional morality of the country nullifies these powers,  preventing them from being ever used; and, by requiring that the head  of the administration should always be virtually appointed by the  House of Commons, makes that body the real sovereign of the state.    These unwritten rules, which limit the use of lawful powers, are,  however, only effectual, and maintain themselves in existence on  condition of harmonising with the actual distribution of real  political strength. There is in every constitution a strongest  power--one which would gain the victory if the compromises by which  the Constitution habitually works were suspended, and there came a  trial of strength. Constitutional maxims are adhered to, and are  practically operative, so long as they give the predominance in the  Constitution to that one of the powers which has the preponderance of  active power out of doors. This, in England, is the popular power. If,  therefore, the legal provisions of the British Constitution, together  with the unwritten maxims by which the conduct of the different  political authorities is in fact regulated, did not give to the  popular element in the Constitution that substantial supremacy over  every department of the government which corresponds to its real power  in the country, the Constitution would not possess the stability which  characterizes it; either the laws or the unwritten maxims would soon  have to be changed. The British government is thus a representative  government in the correct sense of the term; and the powers which it  leaves in hands not directly accountable to the people can only be  considered as precautions which the ruling power is willing should be  taken against its own errors. Such precautions have existed in all  well-constructed democracies. The Athenian Constitution had many such  provisions, and so has that of the United States.    But while it is essential to representative government that the  practical supremacy in the state should reside in the representatives  of the people, it is an open question what actual functions, what  precise part in the machinery of government, shall be directly and  personally discharged by the representative body. Great varieties in  this respect are compatible with the essence of representative  government, provided the functions are such as secure to the  representative body the control of every thing in the last resort.    There is a radical distinction between controlling the business of  government and actually doing it. The same person or body may be able  to control every thing, but can not possibly do every thing; and in  many cases its control over every thing will be more perfect the less  it personally attempts to do. The commander of an army could not  direct its movements effectually if he himself fought in the ranks or  led an assault. It is the same with bodies of men. Some things can not  be done except by bodies; other things can not be well done by them.  It is one question, therefore, what a popular assembly should control,  another what it should itself do. It should, as we have already seen,  control all the operations of government. But, in order to determine  through what channel this general control may most expediently be  exercised, and what portion of the business of government the  representative assembly should hold in its own hands, it is necessary  to consider what kinds of business a numerous body is competent to  perform properly. That alone which it can do well it ought to take  personally upon itself. With regard to the rest, its proper province  is not to do it, but to take means for having it well done by others.    For example, the duty which is considered as belonging more peculiarly  than any other to an assembly representative of the people is that of  voting the taxes. Nevertheless, in no country does the representative  body undertake, by itself or its delegated officers, to prepare the  estimates. Though the supplies can only be voted by the House of  Commons, and though the sanction of the House is also required for the  appropriation of the revenues to the different items of the public  expenditure, it is the maxim and the uniform practice of the  Constitution that money can be granted only on the proposition of the  crown. It has, no doubt, been felt that moderation as to the amount,  and care and judgment in the detail of its application, can only be  expected when the executive government, through whose hands it is to  pass, is made responsible for the plans and calculations on which the  disbursements are grounded. Parliament, accordingly,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5694"],[0,"The Harvard Classics Volume 38 (#15)"],[1,"believed that these spirits  are inseparable from the blood, like those in the veins; that the  blood and spirits constitute one body (like whey and butter in  milk, or heat in hot water), with which the arteries are charged,  and for the distribution of which from the heart they are  provided. This body is nothing else than blood. But if this blood  be said to be drawn from the heart into the arteries by the  diastole of these vessels, it is then assumed that the arteries  by their distension are filled with blood, and not with the  surrounding air, as heretofore; for if they be said also to  become filled with air from the ambient atmosphere, how and when,  I ask, can they receive blood from the heart? If it be answered:  during the systole, I take it to be impossible: the arteries  would then have to fill while they contracted, to fill, and yet  not become distended. But if it be said: during diastole, they  would then, and for two opposite purposes, be receiving both  blood and air, and heat and cold, which is improbable. Further  when it is affirmed that the diastole of the heart and arteries  is simultaneous, and the systole of the two is also concurrent,  there is another incongruity. For how can two bodies mutually  connected, which are simultaneously distended, attract or draw  anything from one another? or being simultaneously contracted,  receive anything from each other? And then it seems impossible  that one body can thus attract another body into itself, so as to  become distended, seeing that to be distended is to be passive,  unless, in the manner of a sponge, which has been previously  compressed by an external force, it is returning to its natural  state. But it is difficult to conceive that there can be anything  of this kind in the arteries. The arteries dilate, because they  are filled like bladders or leathern bottles; they are not filled  because they expand like bellows. This I think easy of  demonstration, and indeed conceive that I have already proved it.  Nevertheless, in that book of Galen headed \"Quod Sanguis  continetur in Arterus,\" he quotes an experiment to prove the  contrary. An artery having been exposed, is opened  longitudinally, and a reed or other pervious tube is inserted  into the vessel through the opening, by which the blood is  prevented from being lost, and the wound is closed. \"So long,\" he  says, \"as things are thus arranged, the whole artery will  pulsate; but if you now throw a ligature about the vessel and  tightly compress its wall over the tube, you will no longer see  the artery beating beyond the ligature.\" I have never performed  this experiment of Galen's nor do I think that it could very well  be performed in the living body, on account of the profuse flow  of blood that would take place from the vessel that was operated  on; neither would the tube effectually close the wound in the  vessel without a ligature; and I cannot doubt but that the blood  would be found to flow out between the tube and the vessel. Still  Galen appears by this experiment to prove both that the pulsative  property extends from the heart by the walls of the arteries, and  that the arteries, whilst they dilate, are filled by that  pulsific force, because they expand like bellows, and do not  dilate as if they are filled like skins, But the contrary is  obvious in arteriotomy and in wounds; for the blood spurting from  the arteries escapes with force, now farther, now not so far,  alternately, or in jets; and the jet always takes place with the  diastole of the artery, never with the systole. By which it  clearly appears that the artery is dilated with the impulse of  the blood; for of itself it would not throw the blood to such a  distance and whilst it was dilating; it ought rather to draw air  into its cavity through the wound, were those things true that  are commonly stated concerning the uses of the arteries. Do not  let the thickness of the arterial tunics impose upon us, and lead  us to conclude that the pulsative property proceeds along them  from the heart For in several animals the arteries do not  apparently differ from the veins; and in extreme parts of the  body where the arteries are minutely subdivided, as in the brain,  the hand, etc., no one could distinguish the arteries from the  veins by the dissimilar characters of their coats: the tunics of  both are identical. And then, in the aneurism proceeding from a  wounded or eroded artery, the pulsation is precisely the same as  in the other arteries, and yet it has no proper arterial  covering. To this the learned Riolanus testifies along with me,  in his Seventh Book.    Nor let any one imagine that the uses of the pulse and the  respiration are the same, because, under the influences of the  same causes, such as running, anger, the warm bath, or any other  heating thing, as Galen says, they become more frequent and  forcible together. For not only is experience in opposition to  this idea, though Galen endeavours to explain it away, when we  see that with excessive repletion the pulse beats more forcibly,  whilst the respiration is diminished in amount;, but in young  persons the pulse is quick, whilst respiration is slow. So it is  also in alarm, and amidst care, and under anxiety of mind;  sometimes, too, in fevers, the pulse is rapid, but the  respiration is slower than usual.    These and other objections of the same kind may be urged against  the opinions mentioned. Nor are the views that are entertained of  the offices and pulse of the heart, perhaps, less bound up with  great and most inextricable difficulties. The heart, it is  vulgarly said, is the fountain and workshop of the vital spirits,  the centre from which life is dispensed to the several parts of  the body. Yet it is denied that the right ventricle makes  spirits, which is rather held to supply nourishment to the lungs.  For these reasons it is maintained that fishes are without any  right ventricle (and indeed every animal wants a right ventricle  which is unfurnished with lungs), and that the right ventricle is  present solely for the sake of the lungs.    1. Why, I ask, when we see that the structure of both ventricles  is almost identical, there being the same apparatus of fibres,  and braces, and valves, and vessels, and auricles, and both in  the same way in our dissections are found to be filled up with  blood similarly black in colour, and coagulated--why, I say,  should their uses be imagined to be different, when the action,  motion, and pulse of both are the same? If the three tricuspid  valves placed at the entrance into the right ventricle prove  obstacles to the reflux of the blood into the vena cava, and if  the three semilunar valves which are situated at the commencement  of the pulmonary artery be there, that they may prevent the  return of the blood into the ventricle; why, when we find similar  structures in connexion with the left ventricle, should we deny  that they are there for the same end, of preventing here the  egress, there the regurgitation, of the blood?    2. And, when we have these structures, in points of size, form,  and situation, almost in every respect the same in the left as in  the right ventricle, why should it be said that things are  arranged in the former for the egress and regress of spirits, and  in the latter or right ventricle, for the blood? The same  arrangement cannot be held fitted to favour or impede the motion  of the blood and of spirits indifferently.    3. And when we observe that the passages and vessels are  severally in relation to one another in point of size, viz., the  pulmonary artery to the pulmonary veins; why should the one be  destined to a private purpose, that of furnishing the lungs, the  other to a public function?    4. And as Realdus Columbus says, is it probable that such a  quantity of blood should be required for the nutrition of the  lungs; the vessel that leads to them, the vena arteriosa or  pulmonary artery being of greater capacity than both the iliac  veins?    5. And I ask, as the lungs are so close at hand, and in continual  motion, and the vessel that supplies them is of such dimensions,  what is the use or meaning of this pulse of the right ventricle?  and why was nature reduced to the necessity of adding another  ventricle for the sole purpose of nourishing the lungs?    When it is said that the left ventricle draws materials for the  formation of spirits, air and blood, from the lungs and right  sinuses of the heart, and in like manner sends spirituous blood  into the aorta, drawing fuliginous vapours from there, and  sending them by the pulmonary vein into the lungs, whence spirits  are at the same time obtained for transmission into the aorta, I  ask how, and by what means is the separation effected? And how  comes it that spirits and fuliginous vapours can pass hither and  thither without admixture or confusion? If the mitral cuspidate  valves do not prevent the egress of fuliginous vapours to the  lungs, how should they oppose the escape of air? And how should  the semiluftars hinder the regress of spirits from the aorta upon  each supervening diastole of the heart? Above all, how can they  say that the spirituous blood is sent from the pulmonary veins by  the left ventricle into the lungs without any obstacle to its  passage from the mitral valves, when they have previously  asserted that the air entered by the same vessel from the lungs  into the left ventricle, and have brought forward these same  mitral valves as obstacles to its retrogression? Good God! how  should the mitral valves prevent the regurgitation of air and not  of blood?    Moreover, when they appoint the pulmonary artery, a vessel of  great size, with the coverings of an artery, to none but a kind  of private and single purpose, that, namely, of nourishing the  lungs, why should the pulmonary vein, which is scarcely so large,  which has the coats of a vein, and is soft and lax, be"]]]
