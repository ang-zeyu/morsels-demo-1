The discovery of Lagasca and Le Couteur was [98] of course not  applicable to the wheat of Jersey alone. The common cultivated sorts of  wheat and other grains were mixtures then as they are even now. Improved  varieties are, or at least should be, in most cases pure and uniform,  but ordinary sorts, as a rule, are mixtures. Wheat, barley and oats are  self-fertile and do not mix in the field through cross-pollination.  Every member of the assemblage propagates itself, and is only checked by  its own greater or less adaptation to the given conditions of life.  Rimpau has dealt at large with the phenomenon as it occurs in the  northern and middle parts of Germany. Even Rivett's \"Bearded wheat,\"  which was introduced from England as a fine improved variety, and has  become widely distributed throughout Germany, cannot keep itself pure.  It is found mingled almost anywhere with the old local varieties, which  it was destined to supplant. Any lot of seed exhibits such impurities,  as I have had the opportunity of observing myself in sowings in the  experimental-garden. But the impurities are only mixtures, and all the  plants of Rivett's \"Bearded wheat,\" which of course constitute the large  majority, are of pure blood. This may be confirmed when the seeds are  collected and sown separately in cultures that can be carefully guarded.    [99] In order to get a closer insight into the causes of this confused  condition of ordinary races, Rimpau made some observations on Rivett's  wheat. He found that it suffers from frost during winter more than the  local German varieties, and that from various causes, alien seeds may  accidentally, and not rarely, become mixed with it. The  threshing-machines are not always as clean as they should be and may be  the cause of an accidental mixture. The manure comes from stables, where  straw and the dust from many varieties are thrown together, and  consequently living kernels may become mixed with the dung. Such stray  grains will easily germinate in the fields, where they find more  congenial conditions than does the improved variety. If winter arrives  and kills quantities of this latter, the accidental local races will  find ample space to develop. Once started, they will be able to multiply  so rapidly, that in one or two following generations they will  constitute a very considerable portion of the whole harvest. In this way  the awnless German wheat often prevails over the introduced English  variety, if the latter is not kept pure by continuous selection.    The Swiss wheat-breeder Risler made an experiment which goes to prove  the certainty of the explanation given by Rimpau. He observed on his  farm at Saleves near the lake of Geneva that after a lapse of time the  \"Galland wheat\" deteriorated and assumed, as was generally believed, the  characters of the local sorts. In order to ascertain the real cause of  this apparent change, he sowed in alternate rows in a field, the  \"Galland\" and one of the local varieties. The \"Galland\" is a race with  obvious characters and was easily distinguished from the other at the  time when the heads were ripe. They are bearded when flowering, but  afterwards throw off the awns. The kernels are very large and yield an  extraordinarily good, white flour.    During the first summer all the heads of the \"Galland\" rows had the  deciduous awns but the following year these were only seen on half of  the plants, the remainder having smooth heads, and the third year the  \"Galland\" had nearly disappeared, being supplanted by the competing  local race. The cause of this rapid change was found to be twofold.  First the \"Galland,\" as an improved variety, suffers from the winter in  a far higher degree than the native Swiss sorts, and secondly it ripens  its kernels one or two weeks later. At the time of harvest it may not  have become fully ripe, while the varieties mixed with it had reached  maturity. The wild oat, _Avena fatua_, is very common in [101] Europe  from whence it has been introduced in the United States. In summers  which are unfavorable to the development of the cultivated oats it may  be observed to multiply with an almost incredible rapidity. It does not  contribute to the harvest, and is quite useless. If no selection were  made, or if selection were discontinued, it would readily supplant the  cultivated varieties.    From these several observations and experiments it may be seen, that it  is not at all easy to keep the common varieties of cereals pure and that  even the best are subject to the encroachment of impurities. Hence it is  only natural that races of cereals, when cultivated without the utmost  care, or even when selected without an exact knowledge of their single  constituents, are always observed to be more or less in a mixed  condition. Here, as everywhere with cultivated and wild plants, the  systematic species consist of a number of minor types, which pertain to  different countries and climates, and are growing together in the same  climate and under the same external conditions. They do not mingle, nor  are their differentiating characters destroyed by intercrossing. They  each remain pure, and may be isolated whenever and wherever the  desirability for such a proceeding should arise. The purity of [102] the  races is a condition implanted in them by man, and nature always strives  against this arbitrary and one-sided improvement. Numerous slight  differences in characters and numerous external influences benefit the  minor types and bring them into competition with the better ones.  Sometimes they tend to supplant the latter wholly, but ordinarily sooner  or later a state of equilibrium is reached, in which henceforth the  different sorts may live together. Some are favored by warm and others  by cool summers, some are injured by hard winters while others thrive  then and are therefore relatively at an advantage. The mixed condition  is the rule, purity is the exception.    Different sorts of cereals are not always easily distinguishable by the  layman and therefore I will draw your attention to conditions in  meadows, where a corresponding phenomenon can be observed in a much  simpler way.    Only artificial pasture-grounds are seen to consist of a single species  of grass or clover. The natural condition in meadows is the occurrence  of clumps of grasses and some clovers, mixed up with perhaps twenty or  more species of other genera and families. The numerical proportion of  these constituents is of great interest, and has been studied at  Rothamstead in England and on a number of other farms. It is [103]  always changing. No two successive years show exactly the same  proportions. At one time one species prevails, at another time one or  two or more other species. The weather during the spring and summer  benefits some and hurts others, the winter may be too cold for some, but  again harmless for others, the rainfall may partly drown some species,  while others remain uninjured. Some weeds may be seen flowering  profusely during some years, while in other summers they are scarcely to  be found in the same meadow. The whole population is in a fluctuating  state, some thriving and others deteriorating. It is a continuous  response to the ever changing conditions of the weather. Rarely a  species is wholly annihilated, though it may apparently be so for years;  but either from seeds or from rootstocks, or even from neighboring  lands, it may sooner or later regain its foothold in the general  struggle for life.    This phenomenon is a very curious and interesting one. The struggle for  life, which plays so considerable a part in the modern theories of  evolution, may be seen directly at work. It does not alter the species  themselves, as is commonly supposed, but it is always changing their  numerical proportion. Any lasting change in the external conditions will  of course alter the average oscillation and the influence [104] of such  alterations will manifest itself in most cases simply in new numerical  proportions. Only extremes have extreme effects, and the chance for the  weaker sorts to be completely overthrown is therefore very small.    Any one, who has the opportunity of observing a waste field during a  series of years, should make notes concerning the numerical proportions  of its inhabitants. Exact figures are not at all required; approximate  estimates will ordinarily prove to be sufficient, if only the standard  remains the same during the succeeding years.    The entire mass of historic evidence goes to prove that the same  conditions have always prevailed, from the very beginning of cultivation  up to the present time. The origin of the cultivation of cereals is to  be sought in central Asia. The recent researches of Solms Laubach show  it to be highly probable that the historic origin of the wheat  cultivated in China, is the same as that of the wheat of Egypt and  Europe. Remains of cereals are found in the graves of Egyptian mummies,  in the mounds of waste material of the lake-dwellings of Central Europe,  and figures of cereals are to be seen on old Roman coins. In the  sepulchre of King Ra-n-Woser of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt, who lived  about 2000 years B.C., two [105] tombs have recently been opened by the  German Oriental Society. In them were found quantities of the tares of  the _Triticum dicoccum_, one of the more primitive forms of wheat. In  other temples and pyramids and among the stones of the walls of Dashur  and El Kab studied by Unger, different species and varieties of cereals  were discovered in large quantities, that showed their identity with the  present prevailing cultivated races of Egypt.    The inhabitants of the lake-dwellings in Switzerland possessed some  varieties of cereals, which have entirely disappeared. They are  distinguished by Heer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7238"],[0,"My Four Years in Germany (#15)"],[1,"that they have  nothing to expect from the government, who dare to speak in  criticism.    All the newspapers are subject to control as in no other country.  In the first place their proprietors are subject to the influence  of the _Rat_ system as is every other German, and the newspaper  proprietor, whose sons perhaps enter the army, whose daughters  may be married to naval officers or officials, and who seeks  for his sons promotion as judge, state's attorney, etc., has  to be very careful that the utterances of his newspaper do not  prevent his promotion in the social scale or interfere with the  career of his family and relations.    Since the war while a preventive censure does not exist in Germany  nevertheless a newspaper may be suppressed at will; a fearful  punishment for a newspaper, which, by being suppressed for, say,  five days or a week, has its business affairs thrown into the utmost  confusion and suffers an enormous direct loss.    Many of the larger newspapers are either owned or influenced by  concerns like the Krupps'. For instance, during this war, all  news coming from Germany to other countries has been furnished  by either the Over-Seas Or Trans-Ocean service, both news agencies  in which the Krupps are large stockholders. The smaller newspapers  are influenced directly by the government.    In the Middle Ages there was often declared a sort of truce to  prevent fighting in a city, which was called the _Burgfrieden_  or \"peace of the city,\" and, at the beginning of this war, all  political parties were supposed to declare a sort of  _Burgfrieden_ and not try to obtain any political advantage.    There was, therefore, intense indignation among the Social Democrats  of Germany when it was discovered, in the spring of 1916, that  the Minister of the Interior was making arrangements to send out  news service to be furnished free to the smaller newspapers, and  that he was engaged in instructing the various _Landräte_  and other officials of the Interior Department how effectively to  use this machinery in order to gull the people to the advantage  of the government, and to keep them in ignorance of anything  which might tend to turn them against the system.    Besides the _Rat_ system there is, of course, the system  of decorations. Countless orders and decorations are given in  Germany. At the head is the Order of the Black Eagle; there are  the Order of the Red Eagle, the Prussian Order of the Crown,  the orders, \"_Pour le Mérite_,\" the Order of the House of  Hohenzollern, and many others, and in each of the twenty-five  States there are also orders, distinctions and decorations. These  orders in turn are divided into numerous classes. For instance, a  man can have the Red Eagle order of the first, second, third or  fourth class, and these may be complicated with a laurel crown,  with an oak crown, with swords and with stars, etc. Even domestic  servants, who have served a long time in one family, receive  orders; and faithful postmen and other officials who have never  appeared on the police books for having made statements against  the government or the army are sure of receiving some sort of  order.    Once a year in Berlin a great festival is held called the  _Ordensfest_, when all who hold orders or decorations of any  kind are invited to a great banquet. The butler, who has served  for twenty-five years, there rubs shoulders with the diplomat who  has received a Black Eagle for adding a colony to the German  Empire, and the faithful cook may be seated near an officer who  has obtained \"_Pour le Mérite_\" for sinking an enemy warship.  All this in one sense is democratic, but in its effect it tends  to induce the plain people to be satisfied with a piece of ribbon  instead of the right to vote, and to make them upholders of a  system by which they are deprived of any opportunity to make  a real advance in life.    This system is the most complete that has ever existed in any  country, because it has drawn so many of the inhabitants of the  country into its meshes. Practically, the industrial workers  of the great towns and the stupid peasants in the country are  the only people in Germany left out of its net.    I had a shooting place very near Berlin, in fact I could reach  it in three quarters of an hour by motor from the Embassy door,  and there I had an opportunity of studying the conditions of  life of the peasant class.    Germany is still a country of great proprietors. Lands may be held  there by a tenure which was abolished in Great Britain hundreds of  years ago. In Great Britain, property may only be tied up under  fixed conditions during the lives of certain chosen people, in  being at the death of the testator. In the State of New York,  property may only be tied up during the lives of two persons,  in being at the death of the person making the will, and for  twenty-one years (the minority of an infant) thereafter. But  in the Central Empires, property still may be tied up for an  indefinite period under the feudal system, so that great estates,  no matter how extravagant the life tenant may be, are not sold  and do not come into the market for division among the people.    [Illustration: AMBASSADOR GERARD ON THE WAY TO HIS SHOOTING  PRESERVE.]    [Illustration: A KEEPER AND BEATERS ON THE SHOOTING PRESERVE.  IT SHOWS THE EARLY INNOCULATION OF DISCIPLINE INTO THE GERMAN  SMALL BOY.]    For instance, to-day there exist estates in the Central Empires  which must pass from oldest son to oldest son indefinitely and,  failing that, to the next in line, and so on; and conditions  have even been annexed by which children cannot inherit if their  father has married a woman not of a stated number of quarterings  of nobility. There is a Prince holding great estates in Hungary.  He is a bachelor and if he desires his children to inherit these  estates there are only thirteen girls in the world whom he can  marry, according to the terms of the instrument by which some  distant ancestor founded this inheritance.    This vicious system has prevented extensive peasant proprietorship.  The government, however, to a certain extent, has encouraged peasant  proprietorship, but only with very small parcels of land; and it  would be an unusual thing in Germany, especially in Prussia,  to find a peasant owning more than twenty or thirty acres of  land, most of the land being held by the peasants in such small  quantities that after working their own lands they have time  left to work the lands of the adjoining landed proprietor at a  very small wage.    All the titles, of the nobility are not confined to the oldest  son. The \"Pocketbook of Counts,\" published by the same firm which  publishes the \"Almanac de Gotha,\" contains the counts of Austria,  Germany and Hungary together, showing in this way the intimate  personal relation between the noble families of these three  countries. All the sons of a count are counts, and so on, ad  infinitum. Thus in Hungary there are probably seventy Counts  Szecheny and about the same number of Zichy, etc. Some of the  German noble families are not far behind. In fact it may be said  that almost any person, in what is known as \"society\" in the  Central Empires, has a title of some sort. The prefix \"von\" shows  that the person is a noble and is often coupled with names of  people who have no title. By custom in Germany, a \"von\" when  he goes abroad is allowed to call himself Baron. But in Germany  he could not do so. These noble families in the Central Empires,  by the system of _Majorat_ which I have described, hold  large landed estates, and naturally exert a great influence upon  their labourers. As a rule the system of tenant farming does not  exist; that is, estates are not leased to small farmers as was  the custom in Ireland and is still in Great Britain, but estates  are worked as great agricultural enterprises under superintendents  appointed by the proprietor. This system, impossible in America or  even in Great Britain, is possible in the Central Empires where  the villages are full of peasants who, not so many generations  ago, were serfs attached to the land and who lived in wholesome  fear of the landed proprietors.    This is the first method by which influence is exercised on the  population. There is also the restricted franchise or \"circle  voting\" which gives the control of the franchise to a few rich  proprietors.    As a rule, the oldest son enters the army as an officer and may  continue, but if he has not displayed any special aptitude for  the military profession he retires and manages his estate. These  estates are calculated by their proprietors to give at least four  per cent interest income on the value of the land. Many younger  sons after a short term of service in the army, usually as officers  and not as _Einjähriger_ leave the army and enter diplomacy  or some other branch of the government service. The offices of  judge, district attorney, etc., not being elective, this career  as well as that leading to the position of _Landrat_ and  over-president of a province is open to those who, because they  belong to old Prussian landed families, find favour in the eyes  of the government. Much is heard in Germany and out of Germany  of the Prussian Squire or Junker.    There is no leisure class among the Junkers. They are all workers,  patriotic, honest and devoted to the Emperor and the Fatherland.  If it is possible that government by one class is to be suffered,  then the Prussian Junkers have proved themselves more fit for rule  than any class in all history. Their virtues are Spartan, their  minds narrow but incorruptible, and their bravery and patriotism  undoubted. One can but admire them and their stern virtues. This  class, largely because of its poverty and its constant occupation,  does not travel; nor does the casual tourist or health seeker in  Germany come in contact with these men. The Junkers will fight  hard to "]]]
