only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell  with us.    01:034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that  went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all  that went out of the gate of his city.    01:034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,  that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took  each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the  males.    01:034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the  sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.    01:034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,  because they had defiled their sister.    01:034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and  that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,    01:034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their  wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.    01:034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to  make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites  and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather  themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I  and my house.    01:034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an  harlot?    01:035:001 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell  there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when  thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.    01:035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with  him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and  change your garments:    01:035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there  an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was  with me in the way which I went.    01:035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in  their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob  hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.    01:035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities  that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of  Jacob.    01:035:006 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that  is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.    01:035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:  because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his  brother.    01:035:008 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath  Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.    01:035:009 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of  Padanaram, and blessed him.    01:035:010 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not  be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called  his name Israel.    01:035:011 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and  multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings  shall come out of thy loins;    01:035:012 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will  give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.    01:035:013 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with  him.    01:035:014 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with  him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and  he poured oil thereon.    01:035:015 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with  him, Bethel.    01:035:016 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little  way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.    01:035:017 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the  midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.    01:035:018 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she  died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him  Benjamin.    01:035:019 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which  is Bethlehem.    01:035:020 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of  Rachel's grave unto this day.    01:035:021 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of  Edar.    01:035:022 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that  Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard  it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:    01:035:023 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and  Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:    01:035:024 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:    01:035:025 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:    01:035:026 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher:  these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.    01:035:027 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the  city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.    01:035:028 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.    01:035:029 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto  his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob  buried him.    01:036:001 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.    01:036:002 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the  daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the  daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;    01:036:003 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.    01:036:004 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;    01:036:005 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are  the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.    01:036:006 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and  all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and  all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into  the country from the face of his brother Jacob.    01:036:007 For their riches were more than that they might dwell  together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them  because of their cattle.    01:036:008 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.    01:036:009 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the  Edomites in mount Seir:    01:036:010 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah  the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.    01:036:011 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam,  and Kenaz.    01:036:012 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare  to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.    01:036:013 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,  and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.    01:036:014 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah  the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and  Jaalam, and Korah.    01:036:015 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the  firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,    01:036:016 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8001"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 1: Genesis (#15)"],[1,"it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,             that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold,             the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked,             speckled, and grisled.    01:031:011 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:             And I said, Here am I.    01:031:012 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams             which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and             grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.    01:031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and             where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from             this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.    01:031:014 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet             any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?    01:031:015 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and             hath quite devoured also our money.    01:031:016 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that             is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath             said unto thee, do.    01:031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon             camels;    01:031:018 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he             had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in             Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of             Canaan.    01:031:019 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the             images that were her father's.    01:031:020 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he             told him not that he fled.    01:031:021 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed             over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.    01:031:022 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.    01:031:023 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven             days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.    01:031:024 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said             unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good             or bad.    01:031:025 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in             the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of             Gilead.    01:031:026 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast             stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as             captives taken with the sword?    01:031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from             me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away             with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?    01:031:028 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?             thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.    01:031:029 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of             your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed             that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.    01:031:030 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore             longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou             stolen my gods?    01:031:031 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:             for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy             daughters from me.    01:031:032 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:             before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and             take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen             them.    01:031:033 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and             into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then             went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.    01:031:034 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's             furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,             but found them not.    01:031:035 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that             I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon             me. And he searched but found not the images.    01:031:036 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered             and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that             thou hast so hotly pursued after me?    01:031:037 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found             of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and             thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.    01:031:038 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she             goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock             have I not eaten.    01:031:039 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare             the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether             stolen by day, or stolen by night.    01:031:040 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost             by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.    01:031:041 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee             fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy             cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.    01:031:042 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear             of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now             empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my             hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.    01:031:043 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my             daughters, and these children are my children, and these             cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and             what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their             children which they have born?    01:031:044 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;             and let it be for a witness between me and thee.    01:031:045 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.    01:031:046 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took             stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the             heap.    01:031:047 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it             Galeed.    01:031:048 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee             this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;    01:031:049 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,             when we are absent one from another.    01:031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take             other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God             is witness betwixt me and thee.    01:031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this             pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:    01:031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will             not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass             over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.    01:031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their             father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his             father Isaac.    01:031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his             brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all             night in the mount.    01:031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons             and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and             returned unto his place.    01:032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.    01:032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he             called the name of that place Mahanaim.    01:032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto             the land of Seir, the country of Edom.    01:032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my             lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with             Laban, and stayed there until now:    01:032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and             womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may             find grace in thy sight.    01:032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy             brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four             hundred men with him.    01:032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided             the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and             the camels, into two bands;    01:032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then             the other company which is left shall escape.    01:032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my             father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy             country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:    01:032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all             the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with             my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two             bands.    01:032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the             hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,             and the mother with the children.    01:032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed             as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for             multitude.    01:032:013 And he lodged there that"]]]
