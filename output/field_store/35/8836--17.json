I dare say you could not  help it.'    'I don't know, grandmother,' said the princess, beginning to cry. 'I  can't always do myself as I should like.  And I don't always try.  I'm  very sorry anyhow.'    The lady stooped, lifted her in her arms, and sat down with her in her  chair, holding her close to her bosom.  In a few minutes the princess  had sobbed herself to sleep.  How long she slept I do not know.  When  she came to herself she was sitting in her own high chair at the  nursery table, with her doll's house before her.        CHAPTER 16    The Ring    The same moment her nurse came into the room, sobbing.  When she saw  her sitting there she started back with a loud cry of amazement and  joy.  Then running to her, she caught her in her arms and covered her  with kisses.    'My precious darling princess! where have you been?  What has happened  to you?  We've all been crying our eyes out, and searching the house  from top to bottom for you.'    'Not quite from the top,' thought Irene to herself; and she might have  added, 'not quite to the bottom', perhaps, if she had known all.  But  the one she would not, and the other she could not say. 'Oh, Lootie!  I've had such a dreadful adventure!' she replied, and told her all  about the cat with the long legs, and how she ran out upon the  mountain, and came back again.  But she said nothing of her grandmother  or her lamp.    'And there we've been searching for you all over the house for more  than an hour and a half!' exclaimed the nurse.  'But that's no matter,  now we've got you!  Only, princess, I must say,' she added, her mood  changing, 'what you ought to have done was to call for your own Lootie  to come and help you, instead of running out of the house, and up the  mountain, in that wild, I must say, foolish fashion.'    'Well, Lootie,' said Irene quietly, 'perhaps if you had a big cat, all  legs, running at you, you might not exactly know what was the wisest  thing to do at the moment.'    'I wouldn't run up the mountain, anyhow,' returned Lootie.    'Not if you had time to think about it.  But when those creatures came  at you that night on the mountain, you were so frightened yourself that  you lost your way home.'    This put a stop to Lootie's reproaches.  She had been on the point of  saying that the long-legged cat must have been a twilight fancy of the  princess's, but the memory of the horrors of that night, and of the  talking-to which the king had given her in consequence, prevented her  from saying what after all she did not half believe--having a strong  suspicion that the cat was a goblin; for she knew nothing of the  difference between the goblins and their creatures: she counted them  all just goblins.    Without another word she went and got some fresh tea and bread and  butter for the princess.  Before she returned, the whole household,  headed by the housekeeper, burst into the nursery to exult over their  darling.  The gentlemen-at-arms followed, and were ready enough to  believe all she told them about the long-legged cat. Indeed, though  wise enough to say nothing about it, they remembered, with no little  horror, just such a creature amongst those they had surprised at their  gambols upon the princess's lawn.    In their own hearts they blamed themselves for not having kept better  watch.  And their captain gave orders that from this night the front  door and all the windows on the ground floor should be locked  immediately the sun set, and opened after upon no pretence whatever.  The men-at-arms redoubled their vigilance, and for some time there was  no further cause of alarm.    When the princess woke the next morning, her nurse was bending over  her.  'How your ring does glow this morning, princess!--just like a  fiery rose!' she said.    'Does it, Lootie?' returned Irene.  'Who gave me the ring, Lootie? I  know I've had it a long time, but where did I get it?  I don't  remember.'    'I think it must have been your mother gave it you, princess; but  really, for as long as you have worn it, I don't remember that ever I  heard,' answered her nurse.    'I will ask my king-papa the next time he comes,' said Irene.        CHAPTER 17    Springtime    The spring so dear to all creatures, young and old, came at last, and  before the first few days of it had gone, the king rode through its  budding valleys to see his little daughter.  He had been in a distant  part of his dominions all the winter, for he was not in the habit of  stopping in one great city, or of visiting only his favourite country  houses, but he moved from place to place, that all his people might  know him.  Wherever he journeyed, he kept a constant look-out for the  ablest and best men to put into office; and wherever he found himself  mistaken, and those he had appointed incapable or unjust, he removed  them at once.  Hence you see it was his care of the people that kept  him from seeing his princess so often as he would have liked.  You may  wonder why he did not take her about with him; but there were several  reasons against his doing so, and I suspect her great-great-grandmother  had had a principal hand in preventing it.  Once more Irene heard the  bugle-blast, and once more she was at the gate to meet her father as he  rode up on his great white horse.    After they had been alone for a little while, she thought of what she  had resolved to ask him.    'Please, king-papa,' she said, 'Will you tell me where I got this  pretty ring?  I can't remember.'    The king looked at it.  A strange beautiful smile spread like sunshine  over his face, and an answering smile, but at the same time a  questioning one, spread like moonlight over Irene's.  'It was your  queen-mamma's once,' he said.    'And why isn't it hers now?' asked Irene.    'She does not want it now,' said the king, looking grave.    'Why doesn't she want it now?'    'Because she's gone where all those rings are made.'    'And when shall I see her?' asked the princess.    'Not for some time yet,' answered the king, and the tears came into his  eyes.    Irene did not remember her mother and did not know why her father  looked so, and why the tears came in his eyes; but she put her arms  round his neck and kissed him, and asked no more questions.    The king was much disturbed on hearing the report of the  gentlemen-at-arms concerning the creatures they had seen; and I presume  would have taken Irene with him that very day, but for what the  presence of the ring on her finger assured him of.  About an hour  before he left, Irene saw him go up the old stair; and he did not come  down again till they were just ready to start; and she thought with  herself that he had been up to see the old lady.  When he went away he  left other six gentlemen behind him, that there might be six of them  always on guard.    And now, in the lovely spring weather, Irene was out on the mountain  the greater part of the day.  In the warmer hollows there were lovely  primroses, and not so many that she ever got tired of them.  As often  as she saw a new one opening an eye of light in the blind earth, she  would clap her hands with gladness, and unlike some children I know,  instead of pulling it, would touch it as tenderly as if it had been a  new baby, and, having made its acquaintance, would leave it as happy as  she found it.  She treated the plants on which they grew like birds'  nests; every fresh flower was like a new little bird to her.  She would  pay visits to all the flower-nests she knew, remembering each by  itself.  She would go down on her hands and knees beside one and say:  'Good morning!  Are you all smelling very sweet this morning?  Good-bye!' and then she would go to another nest, and say the same.  It  was a favourite amusement with her.  There were many flowers up and  down, and she loved them all, but the primroses were her favourites.    'They're not too shy, and they're not a bit forward,' she would say to  Lootie.    There were goats too about, over the mountain, and when the little kids  came she was as pleased with them as with the flowers.  The goats  belonged to the miners mostly-a few of them to Curdie's mother; but  there were a good many wild ones that seemed to belong to nobody.  These the goblins counted theirs, and it was upon them partly that they  lived.  They set snares and dug pits for them; and did not scruple to  take what tame ones happened to be caught; but they did not try to  steal them in any other manner, because they were afraid of the dogs  the hill-people kept to watch them, for the knowing dogs always tried  to bite their feet.  But the goblins had a kind of sheep of their  own--very queer creatures, which they drove out to feed at night, and  the other goblin creatures were wise enough to keep good watch over  them, for they knew they should have their bones by and by.        CHAPTER 18    Curdie's Clue    Curdie was as watchful as ever, but was almost getting tired of his ill  success.  Every other night or so he followed the goblins about, as  they went on digging and boring, and getting as near them as he could,  watched them from behind stones and rocks; but as yet he seemed no  nearer finding out what they had in view.  As at first, he always kept  hold of the end of his string, while his pickaxe, left just outside the  hole by which he entered the goblins' country from the mine, continued  to serve as an anchor and hold fast the other end.  The goblins,  hearing no more noise in that quarter, had ceased to apprehend an  immediate invasion, and kept no watch.    One night, after dodging about and listening till he was nearly falling  asleep with weariness, he began to roll up his ball, for he had  resolved to go home to bed.  It was not long, however, before he began  to feel bewildered.  One after another he passed goblin houses, caves,  that is, occupied by goblin families,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7099"],[0,"A Trip to Manitoba (#15)"],[1,"line,  which relieved the monotony of bacon and ham for breakfast, or went to  the net spread at the mouth of a little river or creek emptying into Lake  Deception, and brought home great jack-fish weighing from two to six  pounds. From a little stream to the north-west of the house we had  delicious brook trout, and occasionally large lake trout from some of the  other lakes, presented by the fishermen in their neighbourhood. I weighed  one which was over nineteen pounds. Sometimes we took short walks up the  line, and through wood-paths made by the men on their way to work. We  picked blueberries whenever our hands were not employed in driving off  the flies.    But our chief excitement during the week was the arrival of the mail. Our  first thought every Thursday morning was, \"This is mail-day,\" and Joe's  white canoe was eagerly watched for--often in vain, as storms on the Lake  of the Woods, when the canoes could not venture out, delayed its coming  until Friday.    Strange as it seems, very few Indians can swim, probably from their fear  that they shall drown while learning. They believe that, if drowned,  their spirits wander for ever in a vain search for the happy  hunting-grounds, and no Indian will marry the daughter of one who has met  his death in that way, lest the curse should descend to him. Yet they have  such faith in their canoes and their own skill in their management of  them, that they will go out fearlessly in storms that a white man would  never face.    On mail-day our field-glasses were in constant requisition, and whoever  was lucky enough to announce the appearance of Joe felt the hero of the  hour. There were other canoes as white as Joe's, so after several  disappointments I studied the trimming on his hat, and never made a  mistake afterwards. Joe was such an important person that I must describe  him. He was a short, slight, though broad-shouldered Indian, wearing a  grey flannel shirt, striped cloth trousers, alpaca coat, prunella boots,  and black felt hat, with several folds of pink and white net twisted  round it. He always had a broad grin on his face, and a hearty \"Bon jour,  nitchee,\" for every one. The dress of his companion or partner differed  from Joe's only in the absence of boots and hat, and wearing the hair  braided in two long tails, instead of being cut short.    How we appreciated our letters no one who has not been in the woods, with  a mail only once a week, can understand. I remember one day after our  mail had arrived, a lad coming in from the shanty to ask if there was  anything for him. His sad face, as he turned away on being told that our  mail-carrier was no longer allowed to bring mails for the contractors'  men, haunted me for days. Poor home-sick boy! he had not heard from his  people for months. I often thought of him afterwards, when, the  contractor having made arrangements for a mail-carrier independent of  the Government, I saw the huge bag brought in every week, and watched the  eager crowd of faces waiting for its contents to be distributed.    We had another source of entertainment in the telegraphic communication  between Winnipeg and all the houses on the line, one of the staff in the  office good-naturedly keeping us posted in current events. Talking to  others along the wire always had a strange significance to me, like  having an invisible guest talking to us, who could only hear what we  chose to repeat. When anything amusing was said, one involuntarily  listened for the invisible laughter. This telegraphic conversation was a  nuisance in one way, for often in the middle of dinner Mr. C---- would  exclaim, \"There's D---- calling!\" and away he would go, and probably not  come back till dinner was cold, the cook cross, and the confusion  general.    We were not without visitors, for the doctor, contractors, and engineers  were coming and going continually. About the middle of July, 1878, the  contractors' head-quarters at Darlington Bay being finished, and more  work going on at that end of the line, his officials moved there, and we  were left with only a gang of forty men in a shanty near. Our fat cook  also went to Bear Lake, about a mile west of the house, which by that  time had received the name of Inver Lodge.    One day towards the end of August a rumour reached us that the woods were  on fire on the other side of the west hill, and that the flames were  travelling towards us. I put on my hat and went up to see if the report  were true, and found flames curling along over the moss and underbrush  near a sand embankment where two or three men were working. The fire did  not look very formidable to me, and on asking the men if there was any  danger of its reaching the house, one put down his barrow, and while he  slowly wetted the palms of his hands, and rubbed them together, said, \"Na  fear, me leddie; a barrowfu' o' sand noo an' then wul keep it fra'  gangin' any further.\" So I went back reassured. But as night came on, the  blaze increased so much that it became alarming. Mr. C---- and the men  were away at Kuwatin, some fifteen miles from us, and could not be back  before daylight. A kindly old Irishman, Michael Cahill, who for a drink  of butter-milk came in the evenings to work in the garden, offered his  services to sit up and watch the fire.    \"Not that he thought there was a ha'porth of danger, but, Lord bless  them! the misthress and the childre 'ud be frightened.\" Poor old man! he  had a true Irish heart, with an air of better days long vanished, and a  deep loyalty to \"thim of the ould stock;\" and his boasts of grandeur and  valiant deeds were mingled with childlike credulity.    The fire was at its height about midnight, and had reached a large tree  in a line with our house, when the wind from the lake caught and drove it  back. The underbrush soon burnt out, but the trees were like pillars of  flame, crackling and roaring in the silent night, till they fell with a  crash to the ground. Half roused by the noise, old Cahill would mutter  something about keeping watch until the master came home. The old fellow  had wrapped himself in his great-coat, and was sitting on a chair in the  yard sound asleep. Fearing that he might catch cold, I woke him. But he  treated the insinuation that he had slept a wink with such indignant  contempt that I had to leave him to take his chance. The fire burnt  itself out before daylight, and we felt as if we had made more fuss than  was necessary, when Mr. C---- and the men arrived after four hours' hard  paddling. About Ingolf the fires raged so fiercely that the engineers  there moved all their valuable instruments and papers into the canoes,  and left the shanty to its fate; a change in the wind, however, saved it,  driving the flames back when the walls were scorching.          CHAPTER XI.

The chimneys in Mr. C----'s house were built of mud, and one of them,  which smoked whenever a fire was lighted, had to be pulled down and  rebuilt. The workmen, who were of various nationalities--Carrière an  Indian, old Cahill an Irishman, a Scotchman, and a Mennonite, who thumped  the mud mortar with a dogged perseverance that was quite amusing--were  all engaged on this chimney. One day I heard Carrière contradict an  assertion of Cahill's with regard to the work, calling it \"a d----d lie!\"  Stepping back from the foot of the ladder on which Carrière stood, the  old Irishman lifted his straw hat with the air of a courtier, and  replied politely, \"Carrière, ye're a gintleman! an' _that's_  another.\"    Before the chimney was quite finished, Mr. and Mrs. C---- went down to  Kuwatin to spend a few days, leaving me with the maid and old Cahill to  superintend the house-cleaning; and many a half-hour's amusement had I,  listening to the old man's reminiscences of Ireland. When he found that I  knew and took an interest in many of the people in his own country his  delight was unbounded. The height of his ambition seemed to be to have  \"tin min undher him,\" and his greatest trial was \"huntin' thim tarmints  of cows.\" He was the butt of all the jokes and tricks in the camps round,  yet he took everything good-naturedly; \"the boys must have their laugh  sometimes,\" being his only comment. He said he was only thirty-seven,  but, according to his own account, he had been \"kept at school till he  was sixteen, lived tin years on the Knight o' Glynne's estate, and gone  fishin' with him in the Shannon, been twinty-five years with Colonel  Kitchener in Limerick, siven years undher Mr. Usborne of Aruprior Canady  West, and knew the Ottawa as well as any man, two years with his brother  in Michigan and two years in Kuwatin, and all the fault of the editor of  the _Ottawa Times_ newspaper, for praisin' up the country and  tellin' lies about the wages.\"    Cahill always dressed in his best on Sunday. How he managed to get up his  white shirts was a mystery. To be sure, one was made to last several  Sundays, for when one side got dirty he turned the other out. The navvies  called him the forest ranger, because he always took the gun with him  when he went for the cows, and each day as he passed the shanties on his  way back empty-handed, they chaffed him about his want of sport. One  evening he returned as usual, apparently empty-handed, but coming into  the kitchen for the milk-pails, he produced from his pockets five  partridges and four pigeons. When I asked him why he did not carry them  to show the men that he did shoot something sometimes, he gave me a  knowing look and said, \"Shure, I wouldn't give thim that satisfaction.\"    We were glad of the game, as a change from the continual salt meat and  fish, being"]]]
