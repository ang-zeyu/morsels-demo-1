On the fourth day of the gale, rapidly nearing the pitch of Cape Horn,  I inspected my chart and pricked off the course and distance to Port  Stanley, in the Falkland Islands, where I might find my way and refit,  when I saw through a rift in the clouds a high mountain, about seven  leagues away on the port beam. The fierce edge of the gale by this  time had blown off, and I had already bent a square-sail on the boom  in place of the mainsail, which was torn to rags. I hauled in the  trailing ropes, hoisted this awkward sail reefed, the forestaysail  being already set, and under this sail brought her at once on the wind  heading for the land, which appeared as an island in the sea. So it  turned out to be, though not the one I had supposed.    I was exultant over the prospect of once more entering the Strait of  Magellan and beating through again into the Pacific, for it was more  than rough on the outside coast of Tierra del Fuego. It was indeed a  mountainous sea. When the sloop was in the fiercest squalls, with only  the reefed forestaysail set, even that small sail shook her from  keelson to truck when it shivered by the leech. Had I harbored the  shadow of a doubt for her safety, it would have been that she might  spring a leak in the garboard at the heel of the mast; but she never  called me once to the pump. Under pressure of the smallest sail I  could set she made for the land like a race-horse, and steering her  over the crests of the waves so that she might not trip was nice work.  I stood at the helm now and made the most of it.    Night closed in before the sloop reached the land, leaving her feeling  the way in pitchy darkness. I saw breakers ahead before long. At this  I wore ship and stood offshore, but was immediately startled by the  tremendous roaring of breakers again ahead and on the lee bow. This  puzzled me, for there should have been no broken water where I  supposed myself to be. I kept off a good bit, then wore round, but  finding broken water also there, threw her head again offshore. In  this way, among dangers, I spent the rest of the night. Hail and sleet  in the fierce squalls cut my flesh till the blood trickled over my  face; but what of that? It was daylight, and the sloop was in the  midst of the Milky Way of the sea, which is northwest of Cape Horn,  and it was the white breakers of a huge sea over sunken rocks which  had threatened to engulf her through the night. It was Fury Island I  had sighted and steered for, and what a panorama was before me now and  all around! It was not the time to complain of a broken skin. What  could I do but fill away among the breakers and find a channel between  them, now that it was day? Since she had escaped the rocks through the  night, surely she would find her way by daylight. This was the  greatest sea adventure of my life. God knows how my vessel escaped.    The sloop at last reached inside of small islands that sheltered her  in smooth water. Then I climbed the mast to survey the wild scene  astern. The great naturalist Darwin looked over this seascape from the  deck of the _Beagle,_ and wrote in his journal, \"Any landsman seeing  the Milky Way would have nightmare for a week.\" He might have added,  \"or seaman\" as well.    The _Spray's_ good luck followed fast. I discovered, as she sailed  along through a labyrinth of islands, that she was in the Cockburn  Channel, which leads into the Strait of Magellan at a point opposite  Cape Froward, and that she was already passing Thieves' Bay,  suggestively named. And at night, March 8, behold, she was at anchor  in a snug cove at the Turn! Every heart-beat on the _Spray_ now  counted thanks.    Here I pondered on the events of the last few days, and, strangely  enough, instead of feeling rested from sitting or lying down, I now  began to feel jaded and worn; but a hot meal of venison stew soon put  me right, so that I could sleep. As drowsiness came on I sprinkled the  deck with tacks, and then I turned in, bearing in mind the advice of  my old friend Samblich that I was not to step on them myself. I saw to  it that not a few of them stood \"business end\" up; for when the  _Spray_ passed Thieves' Bay two canoes had put out and followed in her  wake, and there was no disguising the fact any longer that I was  alone.    Now, it is well known that one cannot step on a tack without saying  something about it. A pretty good Christian will whistle when he steps  on the \"commercial end\" of a carpet-tack; a savage will howl and claw  the air, and that was just what happened that night about twelve  o'clock, while I was asleep in the cabin, where the savages thought  they \"had me,\" sloop and all, but changed their minds when they  stepped on deck, for then they thought that I or somebody else had  them. I had no need of a dog; they howled like a pack of hounds. I had  hardly use for a gun. They jumped pell-mell, some into their canoes  and some into the sea, to cool off, I suppose, and there was a deal of  free language over it as they went. I fired several guns when I came  on deck, to let the rascals know that I was home, and then I turned in  again, feeling sure I should not be disturbed any more by people who  left in so great a hurry.    The Fuegians, being cruel, are naturally cowards; they regard a rifle  with superstitious fear. The only real danger one could see that might  come from their quarter would be from allowing them to surround one  within bow-shot, or to anchor within range where they might lie in  ambush. As for their coming on deck at night, even had I not put tacks  about, I could have cleared them off by shots from the cabin and hold.  I always kept a quantity of ammunition within reach in the hold and in  the cabin and in the forepeak, so that retreating to any of these  places I could \"hold the fort\" simply by shooting up through the deck.    [Illustration: \"They howled like a pack of hounds.\"]    Perhaps the greatest danger to be apprehended was from the use of  fire. Every canoe carries fire; nothing is thought of that, for it is  their custom to communicate by smoke-signals. The harmless brand that  lies smoldering in the bottom of one of their canoes might be ablaze  in one's cabin if he were not on the alert. The port captain of Sandy  Point warned me particularly of this danger. Only a short time before  they had fired a Chilean gunboat by throwing brands in through the  stern windows of the cabin. The _Spray_ had no openings in the cabin  or deck, except two scuttles, and these were guarded by fastenings  which could not be undone without waking me if I were asleep.    On the morning of the 9th, after a refreshing rest and a warm  breakfast, and after I had swept the deck of tacks, I got out what  spare canvas there was on board, and began to sew the pieces together  in the shape of a peak for my square-mainsail, the tarpaulin. The day  to all appearances promised fine weather and light winds, but  appearances in Tierra del Fuego do not always count. While I was  wondering why no trees grew on the slope abreast of the anchorage,  half minded to lay by the sail-making and land with my gun for some  game and to inspect a white boulder on the beach, near the brook, a  williwaw came down with such terrific force as to carry the _Spray_,  with two anchors down, like a feather out of the cove and away into  deep water. No wonder trees did not grow on the side of that hill!  Great Boreas! a tree would need to be all roots to hold on against  such a furious wind.    From the cove to the nearest land to leeward was a long drift,  however, and I had ample time to weigh both anchors before the sloop  came near any danger, and so no harm came of it. I saw no more savages  that day or the next; they probably had some sign by which they knew  of the coming williwaws; at least, they were wise in not being afloat  even on the second day, for I had no sooner gotten to work at  sail-making again, after the anchor was down, than the wind, as on the  day before, picked the sloop up and flung her seaward with a  vengeance, anchor and all, as before. This fierce wind, usual to the  Magellan country, continued on through the day, and swept the sloop by  several miles of steep bluffs and precipices overhanging a bold shore  of wild and uninviting appearance. I was not sorry to get away from  it, though in doing so it was no Elysian shore to which I shaped my  course. I kept on sailing in hope, since I had no choice but to go on,  heading across for St. Nicholas Bay, where I had cast anchor February  19. It was now the 10th of March! Upon reaching the bay the second  time I had circumnavigated the wildest part of desolate Tierra del  Fuego. But the _Spray_ had not yet arrived at St. Nicholas, and by the  merest accident her bones were saved from resting there when she did  arrive. The parting of a staysail-sheet in a williwaw, when the sea  was turbulent and she was plunging into the storm, brought me forward  to see instantly a dark cliff ahead and breakers so close under the  bows that I felt surely lost, and in my thoughts cried, \"Is the hand  of fate against me, after all, leading me in the end to this dark  spot?\" I sprang aft again, unheeding the flapping sail, and threw the  wheel over, expecting, as the sloop came down into the hollow of a  wave, to feel her timbers smash under me on the rocks. But at the  touch of her helm she swung clear of the danger, and in the next  moment she was in the lee of the land.    [Illustration: A glimpse of Sandy Point (Punta Arenas) in the Strait  of Magellan.]    It was the small island in the middle of the bay for which the sloop  had been steering, and which she made with such unerring aim as nearly  to run it down. Farther along in the bay was the anchorage, which I  managed to reach, but before I could get the anchor down another  squall caught the sloop and whirled her round like a top and carried"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6322"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#15)"],[1," sight of the small islands of Alegranza, Montana Clara, and  Graciosa, which appear never to have been inhabited by the  Guanches. They are now visited only for the purpose of gathering  archil, which production is, however, less sought after, since so  many other lichens of the north of Europe have been found to yield  materials proper for dyeing. Montana Clara is noted for its  beautiful canary-birds. The note of these birds varies with their  flocks, like that of our chaffinches, which often differs in two  neighbouring districts. Montana Clara yields pasture for goats, a  fact which proves that the interior of this islet is less arid than  its coasts. The name of Alegranza is synonymous with the Joyous,  (La Joyeuse,) which denomination it received from the first  conquerors of the Canary Islands, the two Norman barons, Jean de  Bethencourt and Gadifer de Salle. This was the first point on which  they landed. After remaining several days at Graciosa, a small part  of which we examined, they conceived the project of taking  possession of the neighbouring island of Lancerota, where they were  welcomed by Guadarfia, sovereign of the Guanches, with the same  hospitality that Cortez found in the palace of Montezuma. The  shepherd king, who had no other riches than his goats, became the  victim of base treachery, like the sultan of Mexico.    We sailed along the coasts of Lancerota, of the island of Lobos,  and of Forteventura. The second of these islands seems to have  anciently formed part of the two others. This geological hypothesis  was started in the seventeenth century by the Franciscan, Juan  Galindo. That writer supposed that king Juba had named six Canary  Islands only, because, in his time, three among them were  contiguous. Without admitting the probability of this hypothesis,  some learned geographers have imagined they recognized, in the two  islands Nivaria and Ombrios, the Canaria and Capraria of the  ancients.    The haziness of the horizon prevented us, during the whole of our  passage from Lancerota to Teneriffe, from discovering the summit of  the peak of Teyde. If the height of this volcano is 1905 toises, as  the last trigonometrical measure of Borda indicates, its summit  ought to be visible at a distance of 43 leagues, supposing the eye  on a level with the ocean, and a refraction equal to 0.079 of  distance. It has been doubted whether the peak has ever been seen  from the channel which separates Lancerota from Forteventura, and  which is distant from the volcano, according to the chart of  Varela, 2 degrees 29 minutes, or nearly 50 leagues. This phenomenon  appears nevertheless to have been verified by several officers of  the Spanish navy. I had in my hand, on board the Pizarro, a  journal, in which it was noted, that the peak of Teneriffe had been  seen at 135 miles distance, near the southern cape of Lancerota,  called Pichiguera. Its summit was discovered under an angle  considerable enough to lead the observer, Don Manual Baruti, to  conclude that the volcano might have been visible at nine miles  farther. It was in September, towards evening, and in very damp  weather. Reckoning fifteen feet for the elevation of the eye, I  find, that to render an account of this phenomenon, we must suppose  a refraction equal to 0.158 of the arch, which is not very  extraordinary for the temperate zone. According to the observations  of General Roy, the refractions vary in England from one-twentieth  to one-third; and if it be true that they reach these extreme  limits on the coast of Africa, (which I much doubt,) the peak, in  certain circumstances, may be seen on the deck of a vessel as far  off as 61 leagues.    Navigators who have much frequented these latitudes, and who can  reflect on the physical causes of the phenomena, are surprised that  the peaks of Teyde and of the Azores* (* The height of this peak of  the Azores, according to Fleurieu, is 1100 toises; to Ferrer, 1238  toises; and to Tofino, 1260 toises: but these measures are only  approximative estimates. The captain of the Pizarro, Don Manuel  Cagigal, proved to me, by his journal, that he observed the peak of  the Azores at the distance of 37 leagues, when he was sure of his  latitude within two minutes. The volcano was seen at 4 degrees  south-east, so that the error in longitude must have an almost  imperceptible influence in the estimation of the distance.  Nevertheless, the angle which the peak of the Azores subtended was  so great, that the captain of the Pizarro was of opinion this  volcano must be visible at more than 40 or 42 leagues. The distance  of 37 leagues supposes an elevation of 1431 toises.) are sometimes  visible at a very great distance, though at other times they are  not seen when the distance is much less, and the sky appears serene  and the horizon free from fogs. These circumstances are the more  worthy of attention because vessels returning to Europe, sometimes  wait impatiently for a sight of these mountains, to rectify their  longitude; and think themselves much farther off than they really  are, when in fine weather these peaks are not perceptible at  distances where the angles subtended must be very considerable. The  constitution of the atmosphere has a great influence on the  visibility of distant objects. It may be admitted, that in general  the peak of Teneriffe is seldom seen at a great distance, in the  warm and dry months of July and August; and that, on the contrary,  it is seen at very extraordinary distances in the months of January  and February, when the sky is slightly clouded, and immediately  after a heavy rain, or a few hours before it falls. It appears that  the transparency of the air is prodigiously increased, as we have  already observed, when a certain quantity of water is uniformly  diffused through the atmosphere. Independent of these observations,  it is not astonishing, that the peak of Teyde should be seldomer  visible at a very remote distance, than the summits of the Andes,  to which, during so long a time, my observations were directed.  This peak, inferior in height to those parts of the chain of Mount  Atlas at the foot of which is the city of Morocco, is not, like  those points, covered with perpetual snows. The Piton, or  Sugar-loaf, which terminates the peak, no doubt reflects a great  quantity of light, owing to the whitish colour of the pumice-stone  thrown up by the crater; but the height of that little truncated  cone does not form a twenty-second part of the total elevation. The  flanks of the volcano are covered either with blocks of black and  scorified lava, or with a luxuriant vegetation, the masses of which  reflect the less light, as the leaves of the trees are separated  from each other by shadows of more considerable extent than that of  the part enlightened.    Hence it results that, setting aside the Piton, the peak of Teyde  belongs to that class of mountains, which, according to the  expression of Bouger, are seen at considerable distances only in a  NEGATIVE MANNER, because they intercept the light which is  transmitted to us from the extreme limits of the atmosphere; and we  perceive their existence only on account of the difference of  intensity subsisting between the aerial light which surrounds them,  and that which is reflected by the particles of air placed between  the mountains and the eye of the observer. As we withdraw from the  isle of Teneriffe, the Piton or Sugar-loaf is seen for a  considerable space of time in a POSITIVE MANNER, because it  reflects a whitish light, and clearly detaches itself from the sky.  But as this cone is only 80 toises high, by 40 in breadth at its  summit, it has recently been a question whether, from the  diminutiveness of its mass, it can be visible at distances which  exceed 40 leagues; and whether it be not probable, that navigators  distinguish the peaks as a small cloud above the horizon, only when  the base of the Piton begins to be visible on it. If we admit, that  the mean breadth of the Sugar-loaf is 100 toises, we find that the  little cone, at 40 leagues distance, still subtends, in the  horizontal direction, an angle of more than three minutes. This  angle is considerable enough to render an object visible; and if  the height of the Piton greatly exceeded its base, the angle in the  horizontal direction might be still smaller, and the object still  continue to make an impression on our visual organs; for  micrometrical observations have proved that the limit of vision is  but a minute only, when the dimensions of the objects are the same  in every direction. We distinguish at a distance, by the eye only,  trunks of trees insulated in a vast plain, though the subtended  angle be under twenty-five seconds.    As the visibility of an object detaching itself in a brown colour,  depends on the quantities of light which the eye meets on two  lines, one of which ends at the mountain, and the other extends to  the surface of the aerial ocean, it follows that the farther we  remove from the object, the smaller the difference becomes between  the light of the surrounding atmosphere, and that of the strata of  air before the mountain. For this reason, when less elevated  summits begin to appear above the horizon, they present themselves  at first under a darker hue than those we discern at very great  distances. In the same manner, the visibility of mountains seen  only in a negative manner, does not depend solely on the state of  the lower regions of the air, to which our meteorological  observations are limited, but also on the transparency and physical  constitution of the air in the most elevated parts; for the image  detaches itself better in proportion as the aerial light, which  comes from the limits of the atmosphere, has been originally more  intense, or has undergone less loss in its passage. This  consideration explains to a certain point, why, under a perfectly  serene sky, the state of the"]]]
