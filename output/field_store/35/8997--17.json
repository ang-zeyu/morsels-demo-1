In a word, the form is  nothing but a significant exterior, the speaking physiognomy of each  thing, which, as long as it is not disfigured by any destructive  accident, gives a true evidence of its hidden essence.    Hence it is evident that the spirit of poetry, which, though  imperishable, migrates, as it were, through different bodies, must, so  often as it is newly born in the human race, mold to itself, out of  the nutrimental substance of an altered age, a body of a different  conformation. The forms vary with the direction taken by the poetical  sense; and when we give to the new kinds of poetry the old names, and  judge of them according to the ideas conveyed by these names, the  application which we make of the authority of classical antiquity is  altogether unjustifiable. No one should be tried before a tribunal to  which he is not amenable. We may safely admit that most of the English  and Spanish dramatic works are neither tragedies nor comedies in the  sense of the ancients; they are romantic dramas. That the stage of a  people in its foundation and formation, who neither knew nor wished to  know anything of foreign models, will possess many peculiarities, and  not only deviate from, but even exhibit a striking contrast to, the  theatres of other nations who had a common model for imitation before  their eyes, is easily supposable, and we should only be astonished  were it otherwise.    [Illustration: #CAROLINE SCHLEGEL#]    But when in two nations, differing so widely as the English and  Spanish in physical, moral, political, and religious respects, the  theatres (which, without being known to one another, arose about the  same time) possess, along with external and internal diversities, the  most striking features of affinity, the attention even of the most  thoughtless cannot but be turned to this phenomenon; and the  conjecture will naturally occur that the same, or, at least, a kindred  principle must have prevailed in the development of both. This  comparison, however, of the English and Spanish theatre, in their  common contrast with every dramatic literature which has grown up out  of an imitation of the ancients, has, so far as we know, never yet  been attempted. Could we raise from the dead a countryman, a  contemporary and intelligent admirer of Shakespeare, and another of  Calderon, and introduce to their acquaintance the works of the poet to  which in life they were strangers, they would both, without doubt,  considering the subject rather from a national than a general point of  view, enter with difficulty into the above idea and have many  objections to urge against it. But here a reconciling criticism[12]  must step in; and this, perhaps, may be best exercised by a German,  who is free from the national peculiarities of either Englishmen or  Spaniards, yet by inclination friendly to both, and prevented by no  jealousy from acknowledging the greatness which has been earlier  exhibited in other countries than his own.    The similarity of the English and Spanish theatres does not consist  merely in the bold neglect of the Unities of Place and Time, or in the  commixture of comic and tragic elements; that they were unwilling or  unable to comply with the rules and with right reason (in the meaning  of certain critics these terms are equivalent), may be considered as  an evidence of merely negative properties. The ground of the  resemblance lies far deeper, in the inmost substance of the fictions  and in the essential relations through which every deviation of form  becomes a true requisite, which, together with its validity, has also  its significance. What they have in common with each other is the  spirit of the romantic poetry, giving utterance to itself in a  dramatic shape. However, to explain ourselves with due precision, the  Spanish theatre, in our opinion, down to its decline and fall in the  commencement of the eighteenth century, is almost entirely romantic;  the English is completely so in Shakespeare alone, its founder and  greatest master; but in later poets the romantic principle appears  more or less degenerated, or is no longer perceivable, although the  march of dramatic composition introduced by virtue of it has been,  outwardly at least, pretty generally retained. The manner in which the  different ways of thinking of the two nations, one a northern and the  other a southern, have been expressed; the former endowed with a  gloomy, the latter with a glowing imagination; the one nation  possessed of a scrutinizing seriousness disposed to withdraw within  itself, the other impelled outwardly by the violence of passion--the  mode in which all this has been accomplished will be most  satisfactorily explained at the close of this section, when we come to  institute a parallel between Shakespeare and Calderon, the only two  poets who are entitled to be called great.    Of the origin and essence of the romantic I treated in my first  Lecture, and I shall here, therefore, merely briefly mention the  subject. The ancient art and poetry rigorously separate things which  are dissimilar; the romantic delights in indissoluble mixtures; all  contrarieties--nature and art, poetry and prose, seriousness and  mirth, recollection and anticipation, spirituality and sensuality,  terrestrial and celestial, life and death, are by it blended in the  most intimate combination. As the oldest law-givers delivered their  mandatory instructions and prescriptions in measured melodies; as this  is fabulously ascribed to Orpheus, the first softener of the yet  untamed race of mortals; in like manner the whole of ancient poetry  and art is, as it were, a rhythmical _nomos_ (law), a harmonious  promulgation of the permanently established legislation of a world  submitted to a beautiful order and reflecting in itself the eternal  images of things. Romantic poetry, on the other hand, is the  expression of the secret attraction to a chaos which lies concealed in  the very bosom of the ordered universe, and is perpetually striving  after new and marvelous births; the life-giving spirit of primal love  broods here anew on the face of the waters. The former is more simple,  clear, and like to nature in the self-existent perfection of her  separate works; the latter, notwithstanding its fragmentary  appearance, approaches nearer to the secret of the universe. For  Conception can only comprise each object separately, but nothing in  truth can ever exist separately and by itself; Feeling perceives all  in all at one and the same time.    Respecting the two species of poetry with which we are here  principally occupied, we compared the ancient Tragedy to a group in  sculpture, the figures corresponding to the characters, and their  grouping to the action; and to these two, in both productions of art,  is the consideration exclusively directed, as being all that is  properly exhibited. But the romantic drama must be viewed as a large  picture, where not merely figure and motion are exhibited in larger,  richer groups, but where even all that surrounds the figures must also  be portrayed; where we see not merely the nearest objects, but are  indulged with the prospect of a considerable distance; and all this  under a magical light which assists in giving to the impression the  particular character desired.    Such a picture must be bounded less perfectly and less distinctly than  the group; for it is like a fragment cut out of the optic scene of  the world. However, the painter, by the setting of his foreground, by  throwing the whole of his light into the centre, and by other means of  fixing the point of view, will learn that he must neither wander  beyond the composition nor omit anything within it.    In the representation of figure, Painting cannot compete with  Sculpture, since the former can exhibit it only by a deception and  from a single point of view; but, on the other hand, it communicates  more life to its imitations by colors which in a picture are made to  imitate the lightest shades of mental expression in the countenance.  The look, which can be given only very imperfectly by Sculpture,  enables us to read much deeper in the mind and perceive its lightest  movements. Its peculiar charm, in short, consists in this, that it  enables us to see in bodily objects what is least corporeal, namely,  light and air.    The very same description of beauties are peculiar to the romantic  drama. It does not (like the Old Tragedy) separate seriousness and the  action, in a rigid manner, from among the whole ingredients of life;  it embraces at once the whole of the chequered drama of life with all  its circumstances; and while it seems only to represent subjects  brought accidentally together, it satisfies the unconscious  requisitions of fancy, buries us in reflections on the inexpressible  signification of the objects which we view blended by order, nearness  and distance, light and color, into one harmonious whole; and thus  lends, as it were, a soul to the prospect before us.    The change of time and of place (supposing its influence on the mind  to be included in the picture and that it comes to the aid of the  theatrical perspective, with reference to what is indicated in the  distance, or half-concealed by intervening objects); the contrast of  gayety and gravity (supposing that in degree and kind they bear a  proportion to each other); finally, the mixture of the dialogical and  the lyrical elements (by which the poet is enabled, more or less  perfectly, to transform his personages into poetical beings)--these,  in my opinion, are not mere licenses, but true beauties in the  romantic drama. In all these points, and in many others also, the  English and Spanish works, which are preeminently worthy of this title  of Romantic, fully resemble each other, however different they may be  in other respects.    Of the two we shall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12083"],[0,"Eric; Or, Little (#16)"],[1,", gave a great yawn, and  then awoke with such an admirably feigned start at seeing Dr. Rowlands,  that Eric, who had been peeping at the scene from over his bed-clothes,  burst into an irresistible explosion of laughter.    Dr. Rowlands swung round on his heel--\"What! Williams! get out of bed,  sir, this instant.\"    Eric, forgetful of his disguise, sheepishly obeyed; but when he stood on  the floor, he looked so odd in his crimson girdle and corked cheeks,  with Dr. Rowlands surveying him in intense astonishment, that the scene  became overpoweringly ludicrous to Duncan, who now in his turn was  convulsed with a storm of laughter, faintly echoed in stifled titterings  from other beds.    \"_Very_ good,\" said Dr. Rowlands, now thoroughly angry, \"you will hear  of this to-morrow;\" and he walked away with a heavy step, stopping at  the lavatory door to restore the tin basin to its proper place, and then  mounting to the studies.    Standing in the passage into which the studies opened, he knocked at  one of the doors, and told a boy to summon all their occupants at once  to the library.    Meanwhile, the dormitory-boys were aghast, and as soon as they heard the  doctor's retreating footsteps, began flocking in the dark to No. 7, not  daring to relight their candles.    \"Good gracious!\" said Attlay, \"only to think of Rowley appearing! How  could he have twigged?\"    \"He must have seen our lights in the window as he came home,\" said Eric.    \"I say, what a row that tin-basin dodge of yours made! What a rage the  Doctor will be in to-morrow?\"    \"Won't you just catch it!\" said Barker to Duncan, but intending the  remark for Eric.    \"Just like your mean chaff,\" retorted Duncan. \"But I say, Williams,\" he  continued, laughing, \"you _did_ look so funny in the whiskers.\"    At this juncture they heard all the study-boys running down stairs to  the library, and, lost in conjecture, retired to their different rooms.    \"What do you think he'll do to us?\" asked Eric.    \"I don't know,\" said Duncan uneasily; \"flog us, for one thing, that's  certain. I'm so sorry about that basin, Eric; but it's no good fretting.  We've had our cake, and now we must pay for it, that's all.\"    Eric's cogitations began to be unpleasant, when the door opened, and  somebody stole noiselessly in.    \"Who's there?\"    \"Upton. I've come to have a chat. The Doctor's like a turkey-cock in  sight of a red handkerchief. Never saw him in such a rage.\"    \"Why, what's he been saying?\" asked Eric, as Upton came and took a seat  on his bed.    \"Oh! he's been rowing us like six o'clock,\" said Upton, \"about 'moral  responsibility,' 'abetting the follies of children,' 'forgetting our  position in the school,' and I don't know what all; and he ended by  asking who'd been in the dormitories. Of course I confessed the soft  impeachment, whereon he snorted 'Ha! I suspected so. Very well, Sir, you  don't know how to use a study; you shall be deprived of it till the end  of term.'\"    \"Did he really, Horace?\" said Eric. \"And it's all my doing that you've  got into the scrape. Do forgive me.\"    \"Bosh! My dear fellow,\" said Upton, \"it's twice as much my fault as  yours; and, after all, it was only a bit of fun. It's rather a bore  losing the study, certainly; but never mind, we shall see all the more  of each other. Good night; I must be off.\"    Next morning, prayers were no sooner over than Dr. Rowlands said to the  boys, \"Stop! I have a word to say to you.\"    \"I find that there was the utmost disorder in the dormitories yesterday  evening. All the candles were relighted at forbidden hours, and the  noise made was so great that it was heard through the whole building. I  am grieved that I cannot leave you, even for a few hours, without your  taking such advantage of my absence; and that the upper boys, so far  from using their influence to prevent these infractions of discipline,  seem inclined rather to join in them themselves. On this occasion I have  punished Upton, by depriving him of a privilege which he has abused; and  as I myself detected Duncan and Williams, they will be flogged in the  library at twelve. But I now come to the worst part of the proceeding.  Somebody had been reckless enough to try and prevent surprise by the  dangerous expedient of putting a tin basin against the iron door. The  consequence was, that I was severely hurt, and _might_ have been  seriously injured in entering the lavatory. I must know the name of the  delinquent.\"    Upton and Eric immediately stood up. Dr. Rowlands looked surprised, and  there was an expression of grieved interest in Mr. Rose's face.    \"Very well,\" said the Doctor, \"I shall speak to you both privately.\"    Twelve o'clock came, and Duncan and Eric received a severe caning.  Corporal punishment, however necessary and desirable for some  dispositions, always produced on Eric the worst effects. He burned, not  with remorse or regret, but with shame and violent indignation, and  listened, with a glare in his eye, to Dr. Rowlands' warnings. When the  flogging was over, he almost rushed out of the room, to choke in  solitude his sense of humiliation, nor would he suffer any one for an  instant to allude to his disgrace. Dr. Rowlands had hinted that Upton  was doing him no good; but he passionately resented the suggestion, and  determined, with obstinate perversity, to cling more than ever to the  boy whom he had helped to involve in the same trouble with himself.    Any attempt on the part of masters to interfere in the friendships of  boys is usually unsuccessful. The boy who has been warned against his  new acquaintance not seldom repeats to him the fact that Mr. So-and-so  doesn't like seeing them together, and after that they fancy themselves  bound in honor to show that they are not afraid of continuing their  connection. It was not strange, therefore, that Eric and Upton were  thrown more than ever into each other's society, and consequently, that  Eric, while he improved daily in strength, activity, and prowess,  neglected more and more his school duties and honorable ambitions.    Mr. Rose sadly remarked the failure of promise in his character and  abilities, and did all that could be done, by gentle firmness and  unwavering kindness, to recal his pupil to a sense of duty. One night he  sent for him to supper, and invited no one else. During the evening he  drew out Eric's exercise, and compared it with, those of Russell and  Owen, who were now getting easily ahead of him in marks. Eric's was  careless, hurried, and untidy; the other two were neat, spirited, and  painstaking, and had, therefore, been marked much higher.    \"Your exercises _used_ to be far better--I may say incomparably better,\"  said Mr. Rose; \"what is the cause of this falling off?\"    Eric was silent.    Mr. Rose laid his hand gently on his head. \"I fear, my boy, you have not  been improving lately. You have got into many scrapes, and are letting  boys beat you in form who are far your inferiors in ability. That is a  very bad _sign_, Eric; in itself it is a discouraging fact, but I fear  it indicates worse evils. You are wasting the golden hours, my boy, that  can never return. I only hope and trust that no other change for the  worse is going on in your character.\"    And so he talked on till the boy's sorrow was undisguised. \"Come,\" he  said gently, \"let us kneel down together before we part.\"    Boy and master knelt down humbly side by side, and, from a full heart,  the young man poured out his fervent petitions for the child beside him.  Eric's heart seemed to catch a glow from his words, and he loved him as  a brother. He rose from his knees full of the strongest resolutions, and  earnestly promised amendment for the future.    But poor Eric did not yet know his own infirmity. For a time, indeed,  there was a marked improvement; but daily life flowed on with its usual  allurements, and when the hours of temptation came, his good intentions  melted away, so that, in a few more weeks, the prayer, and the vows that  followed it, had been obliterated from his memory without leaving any  traces in his life.        CHAPTER XI    ERIC IN COVENTRY                         \"And either greet him not       Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more       Than if not looked on.\"--TROILUS AND CRESSIDA, iii. 3.    Upton, expatriated from his study, was allowed to use one of the smaller  class-rooms which were occupied during play-hours by those boys who were  too high in the school for \"the boarders' room,\" and who were waiting to  succeed to the studies as they fell vacant. There were three or four  others with him in this class-room, and although it was less pleasant  than his old quarters, it was yet far more comfortable than the  Pandemonium of the shell and fourth-form boys.    As a general rule, no boys were allowed to sit in any of the class-rooms  except their legitimate occupants. The rule, however, was very generally  overlooked, and hence Eric, always glad of an opportunity to escape from  the company of Barker and his associates, became a constant frequenter  of his friend's new abode. Here they used to make themselves very  comfortable. Joining the rest, they would drink coffee or chocolate, and  amuse themselves over the fire with Punch, or some warlike novel in a  green or yellow cover. One of them very often read aloud to the rest:  and Eric, being both a good reader and a merry, intelligent listener,  soon became quite a favorite among the other boys.    Mr. Rose had often seen him sitting there, and left him unmolested; but  if ever Mr. Gordon happened to come in and notice him, he invariably  turned him out, and after the first offence or two, had several times  set him an imposition. This treatment gave fresh intensity to his now  deeply-seated disgust at his late master, and his expressions of  indignation at \"Gordon's spite\" were loud and frequent.
