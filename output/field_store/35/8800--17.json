Accident? But had it been necessary to strike at all? His presence alone  would have been enough to save the girl from further molestation; but,  he had thrown himself upon the man like a tiger. Yet, somehow, he felt  no sorrow for that. He knew that if again and yet again he were placed  in the same position he would do even as he had done--even as he had  done with the man Kimber by the Fox and Goose tavern beyond Hamley. He  knew that the blow he had given then was inevitable, and he had never  felt real repentance. Thinking of that blow, he saw its sequel in the  blow he had given now. Thus was that day linked with the present, thus  had a blow struck in punishment of the wrong done the woman at the  crossroads been repeated in the wrong done the girl who had just left  him.    A sound now broke the stillness. It was a door shutting not far off.  Kaid was coming. David turned his face towards the room where Foorgat  Bey was lying dead. He lifted his arms with a sudden passionate gesture.  The blood came rushing through his veins again. His life, which had  seemed suspended, was set free; and an exaltation of sorrow, of pain, of  action, possessed him.    \"I have taken a life, O my God!\" he murmured. \"Accept mine in service  for this land. What I have done in secret, let me atone for in secret,  for this land--for this poor land, for Christ's sake!\"    Footsteps were approaching quickly. With a great effort of the will he  ruled himself to quietness again. Kaid entered, and stood before him in  silence. David rose. He looked Kaid steadily in the eyes. \"Well?\" said  Kaid placidly.    \"For Egypt's sake I will serve thee,\" was the reply. He held out his  hand. Kaid took it, but said, in smiling comment on the action: \"As the  Viceroy's servant there is another way!\"    \"I will salaam to-morrow, Kaid,\" answered David.    \"It is the only custom of the place I will require of thee, effendi.  Come.\"    A few moments later they were standing among the consuls and officials  in the salon.    \"Where is Nahoum?\" asked Kaid, looking round on the agitated throng.    No one answered. Smiling, Kaid whispered in David's ear.          CHAPTER VII. THE COMPACT    One by one the lights went out in the Palace. The excited guests were  now knocking at the doors of Cairene notables, bent upon gossip of the  night's events, or were scouring the bazaars for ears into which to  pour the tale of how David was exalted and Nahoum was brought low; how,  before them all, Kaid had commanded Nahoum to appear at the Palace in  the morning at eleven, and the Inglesi, as they had named David, at ten.  But they declared to all who crowded upon their words that the Inglesi  left the Palace with a face frozen white, as though it was he that had  met debacle, while Nahoum had been as urbane and cynical as though he  had come to the fulness of his power.    Some, on hearing this, said: \"Beware Nahoum!\" But those who had been at  the Palace said: \"Beware the Inglesi!\" This still Quaker, with the white  shining face and pontifical hat, with his address of \"thee\" and \"thou,\"  and his forms of speech almost Oriental in their imagery and simplicity,  himself an archaism, had impressed them with a sense of power. He had  prompted old Diaz Pasha to speak of him as a reincarnation, so separate  and withdrawn he seemed at the end of the evening, yet with an uncanny  mastery in his dark brown eyes. One of the Ulema, or holy men, present  had said in reply to Diaz: \"It is the look of one who hath walked with  Death and bought and sold with Sheitan the accursed.\" To Nahoum Pasha,  Dim had said, as the former left the Palace, a cigarette between his  fingers: \"Sleep not nor slumber, Nahoum. The world was never lost by  one earthquake.\" And Nahoum had replied with a smooth friendliness: \"The  world is not reaped in one harvest.\"    \"The day is at hand--the East against the West,\" murmured old Diaz, as  he passed on.    \"The day is far spent,\" answered Nahoum, in a voice unheard by Diaz;  and, with a word to his coachman, who drove off quickly, he disappeared  in the shrubbery.    A few minutes later he was tapping at the door of Mizraim, the Chief  Eunuch. Three times he tapped in the same way. Presently the door  opened, and he stepped inside. The lean, dark figure of Mizraim bowed  low; the long, slow fingers touched the forehead, the breast, and the  lips.    \"May God preserve thy head from harm, excellency, and the night give  thee sleep,\" said Mizraim. He looked inquiringly at Nahoum.    \"May thy head know neither heat nor cold, and thy joys increase,\"  responded Nahoum mechanically, and sat down.    To an European it would have seemed a shameless mockery to have wished  joy to this lean, hateful dweller in the between-worlds; to Nahoum  it was part of a life which was all ritual and intrigue, gabbling  superstition and innate fatalism, decorated falsehood and a brave  philosophy.    \"I have work for thee at last, Mizraim,\" said Nahoum.    \"At last?\"    \"Thou hast but played before. To-night I must see the sweat of thy  brow.\"    Mizraim's cold fingers again threw themselves against his breast,  forehead, and lips, and he said:    \"As a woman swims in a fountain, so shall I bathe in sweat for thee, who  hath given with one hand and hath never taken with the other.\"    \"I did thee service once, Mizraim--eh?\"    \"I was as a bird buffeted by the wind; upon thy masts my feet found  rest. Behold, I build my nest in thy sails, excellency.\"    \"There are no birds in last year's nest, Mizraim, thou dove,\" said  Nahoum, with a cynical smile. \"When I build, I build. Where I swear by  the stone of the corner, there am I from dark to dark and from dawn to  dawn, pasha.\" Suddenly he swept his hand low to the ground and a ghastly  sort of smile crossed over his face. \"Speak--I am thy servant. Shall I  not hear? I will put my hand in the entrails of Egypt, and wrench them  forth for thee.\"    He made a gesture so cruelly, so darkly, suggestive that Nahoum turned  his head away. There flashed before his mind the scene of death in  which his own father had lain, butchered like a beast in the shambles, a  victim to the rage of Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Mehemet Ali.    \"Then listen, and learn why I have need of thee to-night.\"    First, Nahoum told the story of David's coming, and Kaid's treatment of  himself, the foreshadowing of his own doom. Then of David and the girl,  and the dead body he had seen; of the escape of the girl, of David's  return with Kaid--all exactly as it had happened, save that he did; not  mention the name of the dead man.    It did not astonish Mizraim that Nahoum had kept all this secret. That  crime should be followed by secrecy and further crime, if need be,  seems natural to the Oriental mind. Mizraim had seen removal follow upon  removal, and the dark Nile flowed on gloomily, silently, faithful to the  helpless ones tossed into its bosom. It would much have astonished him  if Nahoum had not shown a gaping darkness somewhere in his tale, and he  felt for the key to the mystery.    \"And he who lies dead, excellency?\"    \"My brother.\"    \"Foorgat Bey!\"    \"Even he, Mizraim. He lured the girl here--a mad man ever. The other  madman was in the next room. He struck--come, and thou shalt see.\"    Together they felt their way through the passages and rooms, and  presently entered the room where Foorgat Bey was lying. Nahoum struck a  light, and, as he held the candle, Mizraim knelt and examined the body  closely. He found the slight wound on the temple, then took the candle  from Nahoum and held it close to the corner of the marble pedestal. A  faint stain of blood was there. Again he examined the body, and ran his  fingers over the face and neck. Suddenly he stopped, and held the light  close to the skin beneath the right jaw. He motioned, and Nahoum laid  his fingers also on the spot. There was a slight swelling.    \"A blow with the fist, excellency--skilful, and English.\" He looked  inquiringly at Nahoum. \"As a weasel hath a rabbit by the throat, so is  the Inglesi in thy hands.\"    Nahoum shook his head. \"And if I went to Kaid, and said, 'This is the  work of the Inglesi,' would he believe? Kaid would hang me for the  lie--would it be truth to him? What proof have I, save the testimony of  mine own eyes? Egypt would laugh at that. Is it the time, while yet the  singers are beneath the windows, to assail the bride? All bridegrooms  are mad. It is all sunshine and morning with the favourite, the Inglesi.  Only when the shadows lengthen may he be stricken. Not now.\"    \"Why dost thou hide this from Kaid, O thou brother of the eagle?\"    \"For my gain and thine, keeper of the gate. To-night I am weak, because  I am poor. To-morrow I shall be rich and, it may be, strong. If Kaid  knew of this tonight, I should be a prisoner before cockcrow. What  claims has a prisoner? Kaid would be in my brother's house at dawn,  seizing all that is there and elsewhere, and I on my way to Fazougli, to  be strangled or drowned.\"    \"O wise and far-seeing! Thine eye pierces the earth. What is there to  do? What is my gain--what thine?\"    \"Thy gain? The payment of thy debt to me.\" Mizraim's face lengthened.  His was a loathsome sort of gratitude. He was willing to pay in kind;  but what Oriental ever paid a debt without a gift in return, even as a  bartering Irishman demands his lucky penny.    \"So be it, excellency, and my life is thine to spill upon the ground, a  scarlet cloth for thy feet. And backsheesh?\"    Nahoum smiled grimly. \"For backsheesh, thy turban full of gold.\"    Mizraim's eyes glittered-the dull black shine of a mongrel terrier's. He  caught the sleeve of Nahoum's coat and kissed it, then kissed his hand.    Thus was their bargain made over the dead body; and Mizraim had an  almost superstitious reverence for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#15)"],[1,", in the title-page of his books, \"Servant  of the Lord Jesus Christ;\" and by force of intellect, and in effect,  he is the last Father in the Church, and is not likely to have a  successor. No wonder that his depth of ethical wisdom should give him  influence as a teacher. To the withered traditional church yielding  dry catechisms, he let in nature again, and the worshiper, escaping  from the vestry of verbs and texts, is surprised to find himself a  party to the whole of his religion. His religion thinks for him, and  is of universal application. He turns it on every side; it fits every  part of life, interprets and dignifies every circumstance. Instead of  a religion which visited him diplomatically three or four times,--  when he was born, when he married, when he fell sick, and when he died,  and for the rest never interfered with him,--here was a teaching which  accompanied him all day, accompanied him even into sleep and dreams;  into his thinking, and showed him through what a long ancestry his  thoughts descend; into society, and showed by what affinities he was  girt to his equals and his counterparts; into natural objects, and  showed their origin and meaning, what are friendly, and what are  hurtful; and opened the future world, by indicating the continuity of  the same laws. His disciples allege that their intellect is invigorated  by the study of his books.    There is no such problem for criticism as his theological writings,  their merits are so commanding; yet such grave deductions must be made.  Their immense and sandy diffuseness is like the prairie, or the desert,  and their incongruities are like the last deliration. He is  superfluously explanatory, and his feelings of the ignorance of men,  strangely exaggerated. Men take truths of this nature very fast. Yet  he abounds in assertions; he is a rich discoverer, and of things which  most import us to know. His thought dwells in essential resemblances,  like the resemblance of a house to the man who built it. He saw things  in their law, in likeness of function, not of structure. There is an  invariable method and order in his delivery of his truth, the habitual  proceeding of the mind from inmost to outmost. What earnestness and  weightiness,--his eye never roving, without one swell of vanity, or  one look to self, in any common form of literary pride! a theoretic  or speculative man, but whom no practical man in the universe could  affect to scorn. Plato is a gownsman; his garment, though of purple,  and almost skywoven, is an academic robe, and hinders action with its  voluminous folds. But this mystic is awful to Caesar. Lycurgus himself  would bow.    The moral insight of Swedenborg, the correction of popular errors, the  announcement of ethical laws, take him out of comparison with any other  modern writer, and entitle him to a place, vacant for some ages, among  the lawgivers of mankind. That slow but commanding influence which he  has acquired, like that of other religious geniuses, must be excessive  also, and have its tides, before it subsides into a permanent amount.  Of course, what is real and universal cannot be confined to the circle  of those who sympathize strictly with his genius, but will pass forth  into the common stock of wise and just thinking. The world has a sure  chemistry, by which it attracts what is excellent in its children, and  lets fall the infirmities and limitations of the grandest mind.    That metempsychosis which is familiar in the old mythology of the  Greeks, collected in Ovid, and in the Indian Transmigration, and is  there objective, or really takes place in bodies by alien will,--in  Swedenborg's mind, has a more philosophic character. It is subjective,  or depends entirely upon the thought of the person. All things in the  universe arrange themselves to each person anew, according to his  ruling love. Man is such as his affection and thought are. Man is man  by virtue of willing, not by virtue of knowing and understanding. As  he is, so he sees. The marriages of the world are broken up. Interiors  associate all in the spiritual world. Whatever the angels looked upon  was to them celestial. Each Satan appears to himself a man; to those  as bad as he, a comely man; to the purified, a heap of carrion. Nothing  can resist states; everything gravitates; like will to like; what we  call poetic justice takes effect on the spot. We have come into a world  which is a living poem. Every thing is as I am. Bird and beast is not  bird and beast, but emanation and effluvia of the minds and wills of  men there present. Every one makes his own house and state. The ghosts  are tormented with the fear of death, and cannot remember that they  have died. They who are in evil and falsehood are afraid of all others.  Such as have deprived themselves of charity, wander and flee; the  societies which they approach discover their quality, and drive them  away. The covetous seem to themselves to be abiding in cells where  their money is deposited, and these to be infested with mice. They who  place merit in good works seem to themselves to cut wood. \"I asked  such, if they were not wearied? They replied, that they have not yet  done work enough to merit heaven.\"    He delivers golden sayings, which express with singular beauty the  ethical laws; as when he uttered that famed sentence, that, \"in heaven  the angels are advancing continually to the springtime of their youth,  so that the oldest angel appears the youngest:\" \"The more angels, the  more room:\" \"The perfection of man is the love of use:\" \"Man, in his  perfect form, is heaven:\" \"What is from Him, is Him:\" \"Ends always  ascend as nature descends:\" And the truly poetic account of the writing  in the inmost heaven, which, as it consists of inflexions according  to the form of heaven, can be read without instruction He almost  justifies his claim to preternatural vision, by strange insights of  the structure of the human body and mind. \"It is never permitted to  any one, in heaven, to stand behind another and look at the back of  his head; for then the influx which is from the Lord is disturbed.\"  The angels, from the sound of the voice, know a man's love; from the  articulation of the sound, his wisdom; and from the sense of the words,  his science.    In the \"Conjugal Love,\" he has unfolded the science of marriage. Of  this book, one would say, that, with the highest elements, it has  failed of success. It came near to be the Hymn of Love, which Plato  attempted in the \"Banquet;\" the love, which, Dante says, Casella sang  among the angels in Paradise; and which, as rightly celebrated, in its  genesis, fruition, and effect, might well entrance the souls, as it  would lay open the genesis of all institutions, customs, and manners.  The book had been grand, if the Hebraism had been omitted, and the law  stated without Gothicism, as ethics, and with that scope for ascension  of state which the nature of things requires. It is a fine Platonic  development of the science of marriage; teaching that sex is universal,  and not local; virility in the male qualifying every organ, act, and  thought; and the feminine in woman. Therefore, in the real or spiritual  world, the nuptial union is not momentary, but incessant and total;  and chastity not a local, but a universal virtue; unchastity being  discovered as much in the trading, or planting, or speaking, or  philosophizing, as in generation; and that, though the virgins he saw  in heaven were beautiful, the wives were incomparably more beautiful,  and went on increasing in beauty evermore.    Yet Swedenborg, after his mode, pinned his theory to a temporary form.  He exaggerates the circumstance of marriage; and, though he finds false  marriages on the earth, fancies a wiser choice in heaven. But of  progressive souls, all loves and friendships are momentary. Do you  love me? means, Do you see the same truth? If you do, we are happy  with the same happiness; but presently one of us passes into the  perception of new truth;--we are divorced, and no tension in nature  can hold us to each other. I know how delicious is this cup of love,--I  existing for you, you existing for me; but it is a child's clinging  to his toy; an attempt to eternize the fireside and nuptial chamber;  to keep the picture-alphabet through which our first lessons are  prettily conveyed. The Eden of God is bare and grand: like the outdoor  landscape, remembered from the evening fireside, it seems cold and  desolate, whilst you cower over the coals; but, once abroad again, we  pity those who can forego the magnificence of nature, for candle-light  and cards. Perhaps the true subject of the \"Conjugal Love\" is  conversation, whose laws are profoundly eliminated. It is false, if  literally applied to marriage. For God is the bride or bridegroom of  the soul. Heaven is not the pairing of two, but the communion of all  souls. We meet, and dwell an instant under the temple of one thought,  and part as though we parted not, to join another thought in other  fellowships of joy. So far from there being anything divine in the low  and proprietary sense of, Do you love me? it is only when you leave  and lose me, by casting yourself on a sentiment which is higher than  both of us, that I draw near, and find myself at your side; and I am  repelled, if you fix your eye on me, and demand love. In fact, in the  spiritual world, we change sexes every moment. You love the worth in  me; then I am your husband: but it is not me, but the worth, that fixes  the love; and that worth is a drop of the ocean of worth that is beyond  me. Meantime, I adore the greater worth in another, and so become his  wife. He aspires to a higher worth in another spirit, and is wife of  receiver of that influence.    Whether a self-inquisitorial habit, that he grew into, from jealousy  of the sins to which men of thought are liable, he has acquired, in  disentangling and demonstrating that"]]]
