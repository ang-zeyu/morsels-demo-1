Most of the cases of epilepsy in our collection show advanced dementia  and in some the clinical history would indicate also original mental  inferiority, that is to say, imbecility or feeble-mindedness.    In these cases the dominant characteristic, so far as shown in the  test records, seems to be a narrowing of the mental horizon manifested  firstly by a tendency to repeat many times one or another word, and  secondly by an abnormally pronounced tendency to make use of  non-specific reactions or particles of speech. Occasionally other  abnormalities are noted, such as perseveration or distraction.    We submit here copies of some test records.      CASE No. 5410.--W.T.K.

Play, sports, and games constitute a more varied, far older, and more  popular field. Here a very different spirit of joy and gladness rules.  Artifacts often enter but can not survive unless based upon pretty  purely hereditary momentum. Thus our first problem is to seek both the  motor tendencies and the psychic motives bequeathed to us from the  past. The view of Groos that play is practise for future adult  activities is very partial, superficial, and perverse. It ignores the  past where lie the keys to all play activities. True play never  practises what is phyletically new; and this, industrial life often  calls for. It exercises many atavistic and rudimentary functions, a  number of which will abort before maturity, but which live themselves  out in play like the tadpole's tail, that must be both developed and  used as a stimulus to the growth of legs which will otherwise never  mature. In place of this mistaken and misleading view, I regard play  as the motor habits and spirit of the past of the race, persisting in  the present, as rudimentary functions sometimes of and always akin to  rudimentary organs. The best index and guide to the stated activities  of adults in past ages is found in the instinctive, untaught, and  non-imitative plays of children which are the most spontaneous and  exact expressions of their motor needs. The young grow up into the  same forms of motor activity, as did generations that have long  preceded them, only to a limited extent; and if the form of every  human occupation were to change to-day, play would be unaffected save  in some of its superficial imitative forms. It would develop the motor  capacities, impulses, and fundamental forms of our past heritage, and  the transformation of these into later acquired adult forms is  progressively later. In play every mood and movement is instinct with  heredity. Thus we rehearse the activities of our ancestors, back we  know not how far, and repeat their life work in summative and  adumbrated ways. It is reminiscent albeit unconsciously, of our line  of descent; and each is the key to the other. The psycho-motive  impulses that prompt it are the forms in which our forebears have  transmitted to us their habitual activities. Thus stage by stage we  reenact their lives. Once in the phylon many of these activities were  elaborated in the life and death struggle for existence. Now the  elements and combinations oldest in the muscle history of the race are  rerepresented earliest in the individual, and those later follow in  order. This is why the heart of youth goes out into play as into  nothing else, as if in it man remembered a lost paradise. This is why,  unlike gymnastics, play has as much soul as body, and also why it so  makes for unity of body and soul that the proverb \"Man is whole only  when he plays\" suggests that the purest plays are those that enlist  both alike. To address the body predominantly strengthens unduly the  fleshy elements, and to overemphasize the soul causes weakness and  automatisms. Thus understood, play is the ideal type of exercise for  the young, most favorable for growth, and most self-regulating in both  kind and amount. For its forms the pulse of adolescent enthusiasm  beats highest. It is unconstrained and free to follow any outer or  inner impulse. The zest of it vents and satisfies the strong passion  of youth for intense erethic and perhaps orgiastic states, gives an  exaltation of self-feeling so craved that with no vicarious outlet it  often impels to drink, and best of all realizes the watchword of the  Turners, _frisch, frei, froehlich, fromm_ [Fresh, free, jovial,  pious.].    Ancient Greece, the history and literature of which owe their  perennial charm for all later ages to the fact that they represent the  eternal adolescence of the world, best illustrates what this  enthusiasm means for youth. Jaeger and Guildersleeve, and yet better  Grasberger, would have us believe that the Panhellenic and especially  the Olympic games combined many of the best features of a modern prize  exhibition, a camp-meeting, fair, Derby day, a Wagner festival, a  meeting of the British Association, a country cattle show,  intercollegiate games, and medieval tournament; that they were the  \"acme of festive life\" and drew all who loved gold and glory, and that  night and death never seemed so black as by contrast with their  splendor. The deeds of the young athletes were ascribed to the  inspiration of the gods, whose abodes they lit up with glory; and in  doing them honor these discordant states found a bond of unity. The  victor was crowned with a simple spray of laurel; cities vied with  each other for the honor of having given him birth, their walls were  taken down for his entry and immediately rebuilt; sculptors, for whom  the five ancient games were schools of posture, competed in the  representation of his form; poets gave him a pedigree reaching back to  the gods, and Pindar, who sang that only he is great who is great with  his hands and feet, raised his victory to symbolize the eternal  prevalence of good over evil. The best body implied the best mind; and  even Plato, to whom tradition gives not only one of the fairest souls,  but a body remarkable for both strength and beauty, and for whom  weakness was perilously near to wickedness, and ugliness to sin,  argues that education must be so conducted that the body can be safely  entrusted to the care of the soul and suggests, what later became a  slogan of a more degenerate gladiatorial athleticism, that to be well  and strong is to be a philosopher--_valare est philosophari_. The  Greeks could hardly conceive bodily apart from psychic education, and  physical was for the sake of mental training. A sane, whole mind could  hardly reside in an unsound body upon the integrity of which it was  dependent. Knowledge for its own sake, from this standpoint, is a  dangerous superstition, for what frees the mind is disastrous if it  does not give self-control; better ignorance than knowledge that does  not develop a motor side. Body culture is ultimately only for the sake  of the mind and soul, for body is only its other ego. Not only is all  muscle culture at the same time brain-building, but a book-worm with  soft hands, tender feet, and tough rump from much sitting, or an  anemic girl prodigy, \"in the morning hectic, in the evening electric,\"  is a monster. Play at its best is only a school of ethics. It gives  not only strength but courage and confidence, tends to simplify life  and habits, gives energy, decision, and promptness to the will, brings  consolation and peace of mind in evil days, is a resource in trouble  and brings out individuality.    How the ideals of physical preformed those of moral and mental  training in the land and day of Socrates is seen in the identification  of knowledge and virtue, \"_Kennen und Koennen_.\" [To know and to have  the power to do] Only an extreme and one-sided intellectualism  separates them and assumes that it is easy to know and hard to do.  From the ethical standpoint, philosophy, and indeed all knowledge, is  the art of being and doing good, conduct is the only real subject of  knowledge, and there is no science but morals. He is the best man,  says Xenophon, who is always studying how to improve, and he is the  happiest who feels that he is improving. Life is a skill, an art like  a handicraft, and true knowledge a form of will. Good moral and  physical development are more than analogous; and where intelligence  is separated from action the former becomes mystic, abstract, and  desiccated, and the latter formal routine. Thus mere conscience and  psychological integrity and righteousness are allied and mutually  inspiring.    Not only play, which is the purest expression of motor heredity, but  work and all exercise owe most of whatever pleasure they bring to the  past. The first influence of all right exercise for those in health is  feeling of well-being and exhilaration. This is one chief source of  the strange enthusiasm felt for many special forms of activity, and  the feeling is so strong that it animates many forms of it that are  hygienically unfit. To act vigorously from a full store of energy  gives a reflex of pleasure that is sometimes a passion and may fairly  intoxicate. Animals must move or cease growing and die. While to be  weak is to be miserable, to feel strong is a joy and glory. It gives a  sense of superiority, dignity, endurance, courage, confidence,  enterprise, power, personal validity, virility, and virtue in the  etymological sense of that noble word. To be active, agile, strong, is  especially the glory of young men. Our nature and history have so  disposed our frame that thus all physiological and psychic processes  are stimulated, products of decomposition are washed out by  oxygenation and elimination, the best reaction of all the ganglionic  and sympathetic activities is accused, and vegetative processes are  normalized. Activity may exalt the spirit almost to the point of  ecstasy, and the physical pleasure of it diffuse, irradiate, and  mitigate the sexual stress just at the age when its premature  localization is most deleterious. Just enough at the proper time and  rate contributes to permanent elasticity of mood and disposition,  gives moral self-control, rouses a love of freedom with all that that  great word means, and favors all higher human aspirations.    In all these modes of developing our efferent powers, we conceive that  the race comes very close to the individual youth, and that ancestral  momenta animate motor neurons and muscles and preside over most of the  combinations. Some of the elements speak with a still small voice  raucous with age. The first spontaneous movements of infancy are  hieroglyphs, to most of which we have as yet no good key. Many  elements are so"]]]
