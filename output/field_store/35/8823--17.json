We then brought out  the guns, and being joined by the other escort, proceeded to a trial of  skill. The Arabs planted a bone about 200 paces from us,--a long distance  for a people who seldom fire beyond fifty yards;--moreover, the wind blew  the flash strongly in their faces. Some shot two or three dozen times wide  of the mark and were derided accordingly: one man hit the bone; he at once  stopped practice, as the wise in such matters will do, and shook hands  with all the party. He afterwards showed that his success on this occasion  had been accidental; but he was a staunch old sportsman, remarkable, as  the Arab Bedouins generally are, for his skill and perseverance in  stalking. Having no rifle, I remained a spectator. My revolvers excited  abundant attention, though none would be persuaded to touch them. The  largest, which fitted with a stock became an excellent carbine, was at  once named Abu Sittah (the Father of Six) and the Shaytan or Devil: the  pocket pistol became the Malunah or Accursed, and the distance to which it  carried ball made every man wonder. The Arabs had antiquated matchlocks,  mostly worn away to paper thinness at the mouth: as usual they fired with  the right elbow raised to the level of the ear, and the left hand grasping  the barrel, where with us the breech would be. Hassan Turki had one of  those fine old Shishkhanah rifles formerly made at Damascus and Senaa: it  carried a two-ounce ball with perfect correctness, but was so badly  mounted in its block-butt, shaped like a Dutch cheese, that it always  required a rest.    On our return home we met a party of Eesa girls, who derided my colour and  doubted the fact of my being a Moslem. The Arabs declared me to be a  Shaykh of Shaykhs, and translated to the prettiest of the party an  impromptu proposal of marriage. She showed but little coyness, and stated  her price to be an Audulli or necklace [26], a couple of Tobes,--she asked  one too many--a few handfuls of beads, [27] and a small present for her  papa. She promised, naively enough, to call next day and inspect the  goods: the publicity of the town did not deter her, but the shamefacedness  of my two companions prevented our meeting again. Arrived at Zayla after a  sunny walk, the Arab escort loaded their guns, formed a line for me to  pass along, fired a salute, and entered to coffee and sweetmeats.    On the 24th of November I had an opportunity of seeing what a timid people  are these Somal of the towns, who, as has been well remarked, are, like  the settled Arabs, the worst specimens of their race. Three Eesa Bedouins  appeared before the southern gate, slaughtered a cow, buried its head, and  sent for permission to visit one of their number who had been imprisoned  by the Hajj for the murder of his son Masud. The place was at once thrown  into confusion, the gates were locked, and the walls manned with Arab  matchlock men: my three followers armed themselves, and I was summoned to  the fray. Some declared that the Bedouins were \"doing\" [28] the town;  others that they were the van of a giant host coming to ravish, sack, and  slay: it turned out that these Bedouins had preceded their comrades, who  were bringing in, as the price of blood [29], an Abyssinian slave, seven  camels, seven cows, a white mule, and a small black mare. The prisoner was  visited by his brother, who volunteered to share his confinement, and the  meeting was described as most pathetic: partly from mental organisation  and partly from the peculiarities of society, the only real tie  acknowledged by these people is that which connects male kinsmen. The  Hajj, after speaking big, had the weakness to let the murderer depart  alive: this measure, like peace-policy in general, is the best and surest  way to encourage bloodshed and mutilation. But a few months before, an  Eesa Bedouin enticed out of the gates a boy about fifteen, and slaughtered  him for the sake of wearing the feather. His relations were directed to  receive the Diyat or blood fine, and the wretch was allowed to depart  unhurt--a silly clemency!    You must not suppose, dear L., that I yielded myself willingly to the  weary necessity of a month at Zayla. But how explain to you the obstacles  thrown in our way by African indolence, petty intrigue, and interminable  suspicion? Four months before leaving Aden I had taken the precaution of  meeting the Hajj, requesting him to select for us an Abban [30], or  protector, and to provide camels and mules; two months before starting I  had advanced to him the money required in a country where nothing can be  done without a whole or partial prepayment. The protector was to be  procured anywhere, the cattle at Tajurrah, scarcely a day's sail from  Zayla: when I arrived nothing was forthcoming. I at once begged the  governor to exert himself: he politely promised to start a messenger that  hour, and he delayed doing so for ten days. An easterly wind set in and  gave the crew an excuse for wasting another fortnight. [31] Travellers are  an irritable genus: I stormed and fretted at the delays to show  earnestness of purpose. All the effect was a paroxysm of talking. The Hajj  and his son treated me, like a spoilt child, to a double allowance of food  and milk: they warned me that the small-pox was depopulating Harar, that  the road swarmed with brigands, and that the Amir or prince was certain  destruction,--I contented myself with determining that both were true  Oriental hyperbolists, and fell into more frequent fits of passion. The  old man could not comprehend my secret. \"If the English,\" he privately  remarked, \"wish to take Harar, let them send me 500 soldiers; if not, I  can give all information concerning it.\" When convinced of my  determination to travel, he applied his mind to calculating the benefit  which might be derived from the event, and, as the following pages will  show, he was not without success.    Towards the end of November, four camels were procured, an Abban was  engaged, we hired two women cooks and a fourth servant; my baggage was  reformed, the cloth and tobacco being sewn up in matting, and made to fit  the camels' sides [32]; sandals were cut out for walking, letters were  written, messages of dreary length,--too important to be set down in black  and white,--were solemnly entrusted to us, palavers were held, and affairs  began to wear the semblance of departure. The Hajj strongly recommended us  to one of the principal families of the Gudabirsi tribe, who would pass us  on to their brother-in-law Adan, the Gerad or prince of the Girhi; and he,  in due time, to his kinsman the Amir of Harar. The chain was commenced by  placing us under the protection of one Raghe, a petty Eesa chief of the  Mummasan clan. By the good aid of the Hajj and our sweetmeats, he was  persuaded, for the moderate consideration of ten Tobes [33], to accompany  us to the frontier of his clan, distant about fifty miles, to introduce us  to the Gudabirsi, and to provide us with three men as servants, and a  suitable escort, a score or so, in dangerous places. He began, with us in  an extravagant manner, declaring that nothing but \"name\" induced him to  undertake the perilous task; that he had left his flocks and herds at a  season of uncommon risk, and that all his relations must receive a certain  honorarium. But having paid at least three pounds for a few days of his  society, we declined such liberality, and my companions, I believe,  declared that it would be \"next time:\"--on all such occasions I make a  point of leaving the room, since for one thing given at least five are  promised on oath. Raghe warned us seriously to prepare for dangers and  disasters, and this seemed to be the general opinion of Zayla, whose timid  citizens determined that we were tired of our lives. The cold had driven  the Nomads from the hills to the warm maritime Plains [34], we should  therefore traverse a populous region; and, as the End of Time aptly  observed, \"Man eats you up, the Desert does not.\" Moreover this year the  Ayyal Nuh Ismail, a clan of the Habr Awal tribe, is \"out,\" and has been  successful against the Eesa, who generally are the better men. They sweep  the country in Kaum or Commandos [35], numbering from twenty to two  hundred troopers, armed with assegai, dagger, and shield, and carrying a  water skin and dried meat for a three days' ride, sufficient to scour the  length of the low land. The honest fellows are not so anxious to plunder  as to ennoble themselves by taking life: every man hangs to his saddle bow  an ostrich [36] feather,--emblem of truth,--and the moment his javelin has  drawn blood, he sticks it into his tufty pole with as much satisfaction as  we feel when attaching a medal to our shell-jackets. It is by no means  necessary to slay the foe in fair combat: Spartan-like, treachery is  preferred to stand-up fighting; and you may measure their ideas of honor,  by the fact that women are murdered in cold blood, as by the Amazulus,  with the hope that the unborn child may prove a male. The hero carries  home the trophy of his prowess [37], and his wife, springing from her  tent, utters a long shrill scream of joy, a preliminary to boasting of her  man's valour, and bitterly taunting the other possessors of _noirs  faineants_: the derided ladies abuse their lords with peculiar virulence,  and the lords fall into paroxysms of envy, hatred, and malice. During my  short stay at Zayla six or seven murders were committed close to the  walls: the Abban brought news, a few hours before our departure, that two  Eesas had been slaughtered by the Habr Awal. The Eesa and Dankali also  have a blood feud, which causes perpetual loss of life. But a short time  ago six men of these two tribes were travelling together, when suddenly  the last but one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/689"],[0,"The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories (#15)"],[1,"aceful, languid  figure appeared. In her face, in her eyes, a timidity, an insinuating  expression, which she tried to hide, but which I saw, and of which I  understood the meaning. I came near suffocating, such were my efforts to  hold my breath, and, continuing to look at her, I took my cigarette, and  lighted it.    \"'What does this mean? One comes to talk with you, and you go to  smoking.'    \"And she sat down beside me on the sofa, resting against my shoulder. I  recoiled, that I might not touch her.    \"'I see that you are displeased with what I wish to play on Sunday,'  said she.    \"'I am not at all displeased,' said I.    \"'Can I not see?'    \"'Well, I congratulate you on your clairvoyance. Only to you every  baseness is agreeable, and I abhor it.'    \"'If you are going to swear like a trooper, I am going away.'    \"'Then go away. Only know that, if the honor of the family is nothing to  you, to me it is dear. As for you, the devil take you!'    \"'What! What is the matter?'    \"'Go away, in the name of God.'    \"But she did not go away. Was she pretending not to understand, or did  she really not understand what I meant? But she was offended and became  angry.    \"'You have become absolutely impossible,' she began, or some such phrase  as that regarding my character, trying, as usual, to give me as much  pain as possible. 'After what you have done to my sister (she referred  to an incident with her sister, in which, beside myself, I had uttered  brutalities; she knew that that tortured me, and tried to touch me in  that tender spot) nothing will astonish me.'    \"'Yes, offended, humiliated, and dishonored, and after that to hold  me still responsible,' thought I, and suddenly a rage, such a hatred  invaded me as I do not remember to have ever felt before. For the first  time I desired to express this hatred physically. I leaped upon her, but  at the same moment I understood my condition, and I asked myself whether  it would be well for me to abandon myself to my fury. And I answered  myself that it would be well, that it would frighten her, and, instead  of resisting, I lashed and spurred myself on, and was glad to feel my  anger boiling more and more fiercely.    \"'Go away, or I will kill you!' I cried, purposely, with a frightful  voice, and I grasped her by the arm. She did not go away. Then I twisted  her arm, and pushed her away violently.    \"'What is the matter with you? Come to your senses!' she shrieked.    \"'Go away,' roared I, louder than ever, rolling my eyes wildly. 'It  takes you to put me in such a fury. I do not answer for myself! Go  away!'    \"In abandoning myself to my anger, I became steeped in it, and I wanted  to commit some violent act to show the force of my fury. I felt a  terrible desire to beat her, to kill her, but I realized that that could  not be, and I restrained myself. I drew back from her, rushed to the  table, grasped the paper-weight, and threw it on the floor by her side.  I took care to aim a little to one side, and, before she disappeared (I  did it so that she could see it), I grasped a candlestick, which I also  hurled, and then took down the barometer, continuing to shout:    \"'Go away! I do not answer for myself!'    \"She disappeared, and I immediately ceased my demonstrations. An hour  later the old servant came to me and said that my wife was in a fit  of hysterics. I went to see her. She sobbed and laughed, incapable of  expressing anything, her whole body in a tremble. She was not shamming,  she was really sick. We sent for the doctor, and all night long I cared  for her. Toward daylight she grew calmer, and we became reconciled under  the influence of that feeling which we called 'love.' The next morning,  when, after the reconciliation, I confessed to her that I was jealous of  Troukhatchevsky, she was not at all embarrassed, and began to laugh in  the most natural way, so strange did the possibility of being led astray  by such a man appear to her.    \"'With such a man can an honest woman entertain any feeling beyond the  pleasure of enjoying music with him? But if you like, I am ready  to never see him again, even on Sunday, although everybody has been  invited. Write him that I am indisposed, and that will end the  matter. Only one thing annoys me,--that any one could have thought him  dangerous. I am too proud not to detest such thoughts.'    \"And she did not lie. She believed what she said. She hoped by her words  to provoke in herself a contempt for him, and thereby to defend herself.  But she did not succeed. Everything was directed against her, especially  that abominable music. So ended the quarrel, and on Sunday our guests  came, and Troukhatchevsky and my wife again played together.\"        CHAPTER XXIII.    \"I think that it is superfluous to say that I was very vain. If one  has no vanity in this life of ours, there is no sufficient reason for  living. So for that Sunday I had busied myself in tastefully arranging  things for the dinner and the musical soiree. I had purchased myself  numerous things for the dinner, and had chosen the guests. Toward six  o'clock they arrived, and after them Troukhatchevsky, in his dress-coat,  with diamond shirt-studs, in bad taste. He bore himself with ease. To  all questions he responded promptly, with a smile of contentment and  understanding, and that peculiar expression which was intended to  mean: 'All that you may do and say will be exactly what I expected.'  Everything about him that was not correct I now noticed with especial  pleasure, for it all tended to tranquillize me, and prove to me that to  my wife he stood in such a degree of inferiority that, as she had  told me, she could not stoop to his level. Less because of my wife's  assurances than because of the atrocious sufferings which I felt in  jealousy, I no longer allowed myself to be jealous.    \"In spite of that, I was not at ease with the musician or with her  during dinner-time and the time that elapsed before the beginning of the  music. Involuntarily I followed each of their gestures and looks.  The dinner, like all dinners, was tiresome and conventional. Not long  afterward the music began. He went to get his violin; my wife advanced  to the piano, and rummaged among the scores. Oh, how well I remember all  the details of that evening! I remember how he brought the violin, how  he opened the box, took off the serge embroidered by a lady's hand, and  began to tune the instrument. I can still see my wife sit down, with a  false air of indifference, under which it was plain that she hid a great  timidity, a timidity that was especially due to her comparative lack  of musical knowledge. She sat down with that false air in front of the  piano, and then began the usual preliminaries,--the pizzicati of the  violin and the arrangement of the scores. I remember then how they  looked at each other, and cast a glance at their auditors who were  taking their seats. They said a few words to each other, and the music  began. They played Beethoven's 'Kreutzer Sonata.' Do you know the first  presto? Do you know it? Ah!\" . . .    Posdnicheff heaved a sigh, and was silent for a long time.    \"A terrible thing is that sonata, especially the presto! And a terrible  thing is music in general. What is it? Why does it do what it does?  They say that music stirs the soul. Stupidity! A lie! It acts, it acts  frightfully (I speak for myself), but not in an ennobling way. It acts  neither in an ennobling nor a debasing way, but in an irritating  way. How shall I say it? Music makes me forget my real situation. It  transports me into a state which is not my own. Under the influence of  music I really seem to feel what I do not feel, to understand what I do  not understand, to have powers which I cannot have. Music seems to me to  act like yawning or laughter; I have no desire to sleep, but I yawn when  I see others yawn; with no reason to laugh, I laugh when I hear others  laugh. And music transports me immediately into the condition of soul  in which he who wrote the music found himself at that time. I become  confounded with his soul, and with him I pass from one condition  to another. But why that? I know nothing about it? But he who wrote  Beethoven's 'Kreutzer Sonata' knew well why he found himself in a  certain condition. That condition led him to certain actions, and for  that reason to him had a meaning, but to me none, none whatever. And  that is why music provokes an excitement which it does not bring to a  conclusion. For instance, a military march is played; the soldier  passes to the sound of this march, and the music is finished. A dance  is played; I have finished dancing, and the music is finished. A mass is  sung; I receive the sacrament, and again the music is finished. But  any other music provokes an excitement, and this excitement is not  accompanied by the thing that needs properly to be done, and that is why  music is so dangerous, and sometimes acts so frightfully.    \"In China music is under the control of the State, and that is the way  it ought to be. Is it admissible that the first comer should hypnotize  one or more persons, and then do with them as he likes? And especially  that the hypnotizer should be the first immoral individual who happens  to come along? It is a frightful power in the hands of any one, no  matter whom. For instance, should they be allowed to play this 'Kreutzer  Sonata,' the first presto,--and there are many like it,--in parlors,  among ladies wearing low necked dresses, or in concerts, then finish the  piece, receive the applause, and then begin another piece? These things  should be played under certain circumstances, only in cases where it is  necessary to incite certain actions corresponding to the music. But to  incite an energy of feeling which corresponds to neither the time nor  the place, and is expended in nothing, cannot fail to act dangerously.  On me in particular this piece acted in a frightful"]]]
