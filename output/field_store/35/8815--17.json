The moment I  concentrate myself on Comrade Bickersdyke for a brief spell, and seem  to be doing him a bit of good, what happens? Why, Comrade Bristow  sneaks off and buys a sort of woollen sunset. I saw the thing  unexpectedly. I tell you I was shaken. It is the suddenness of that  waistcoat which hits you. It's discouraging, this sort of thing. I try  always to think well of my fellow man. As an energetic Socialist, I do  my best to see the good that is in him, but it's hard. Comrade  Bristow's the most striking argument against the equality of man I've  ever come across.'    Mr Waller intervened at this point.    'I think you must really let Jackson go on with his work, Smith,' he  said. 'There seems to be too much talking.'    'My besetting sin,' said Psmith sadly. 'Well, well, I will go back and  do my best to face it, but it's a tough job.'    He tottered wearily away in the direction of the Postage Department.    'Oh, Jackson,' said Mr Waller, 'will you kindly take my place for a few  minutes? I must go round and see the Inward Bills about something. I  shall be back very soon.'    Mike was becoming accustomed to deputizing for the cashier for short  spaces of time. It generally happened that he had to do so once or  twice a day. Strictly speaking, perhaps, Mr Waller was wrong to leave  such an important task as the actual cashing of cheques to an  inexperienced person of Mike's standing; but the New Asiatic Bank  differed from most banks in that there was not a great deal of  cross-counter work. People came in fairly frequently to cash cheques  of two or three pounds, but it was rare that any very large dealings  took place.    Having completed his business with the Inward Bills, Mr Waller made his  way back by a circuitous route, taking in the Postage desk.    He found Psmith with a pale, set face, inscribing figures in a ledger.  The Old Etonian greeted him with the faint smile of a persecuted saint  who is determined to be cheerful even at the stake.    'Comrade Bristow,' he said.    'Hullo, Smithy?' said the other, turning.    Psmith sadly directed Mr Waller's attention to the waistcoat, which was  certainly definite in its colouring.    'Nothing,' said Psmith. 'I only wanted to look at you.'    'Funny ass,' said Bristow, resuming his work. Psmith glanced at Mr  Waller, as who should say, 'See what I have to put up with. And yet I  do not give way.'    'Oh--er--Smith,' said Mr Waller, 'when you were talking to Jackson just  now--'    'Say no more,' said Psmith. 'It shall not occur again. Why should I  dislocate the work of your department in my efforts to win a  sympathetic word? I will bear Comrade Bristow like a man here. After  all, there are worse things at the Zoo.'    'No, no,' said Mr Waller hastily, 'I did not mean that. By all means  pay us a visit now and then, if it does not interfere with your own  work. But I noticed just now that you spoke to Bristow as Comrade  Bristow.'    'It is too true,' said Psmith. 'I must correct myself of the habit. He  will be getting above himself.'    'And when you were speaking to Jackson, you spoke of yourself as a  Socialist.'    'Socialism is the passion of my life,' said Psmith.    Mr Waller's face grew animated. He stammered in his eagerness.    'I am delighted,' he said. 'Really, I am delighted. I also--'    'A fellow worker in the Cause?' said Psmith.    'Er--exactly.'    Psmith extended his hand gravely. Mr Waller shook it with enthusiasm.    'I have never liked to speak of it to anybody in the office,' said Mr  Waller, 'but I, too, am heart and soul in the movement.'    'Yours for the Revolution?' said Psmith.    'Just so. Just so. Exactly. I was wondering--the fact is, I am in the  habit of speaking on Sundays in the open air, and--'    'Hyde Park?'    'No. No. Clapham Common. It is--er--handier for me where I live. Now,  as you are interested in the movement, I was thinking that perhaps you  might care to come and hear me speak next Sunday. Of course, if you  have nothing better to do.'    'I should like to excessively,' said Psmith.    'Excellent. Bring Jackson with you, and both of you come to supper  afterwards, if you will.'    'Thanks very much.'    'Perhaps you would speak yourself?'    'No,' said Psmith. 'No. I think not. My Socialism is rather of the  practical sort. I seldom speak. But it would be a treat to listen to  you. What--er--what type of oratory is yours?'    'Oh, well,' said Mr Waller, pulling nervously at his beard, 'of course  I--. Well, I am perhaps a little bitter--'    'Yes, yes.'    'A little mordant and ironical.'    'You would be,' agreed Psmith. 'I shall look forward to Sunday with  every fibre quivering. And Comrade Jackson shall be at my side.'    'Excellent,' said Mr Waller. 'I will go and tell him now.'          15. Stirring Times on the Common      'The first thing to do,' said Psmith, 'is to ascertain that such a  place as Clapham Common really exists. One has heard of it, of course,  but has its existence ever been proved? I think not. Having  accomplished that, we must then try to find out how to get to it. I  should say at a venture that it would necessitate a sea-voyage. On the  other hand, Comrade Waller, who is a native of the spot, seems to find  no difficulty in rolling to the office every morning. Therefore--you  follow me, Jackson?--it must be in England. In that case, we will take  a taximeter cab, and go out into the unknown, hand in hand, trusting to  luck.'    'I expect you could get there by tram,' said Mike.    Psmith suppressed a slight shudder.    'I fear, Comrade Jackson,' he said, 'that the old noblesse oblige  traditions of the Psmiths would not allow me to do that. No. We will  stroll gently, after a light lunch, to Trafalgar Square, and hail a  taxi.'    'Beastly expensive.'    'But with what an object! Can any expenditure be called excessive which  enables us to hear Comrade Waller being mordant and ironical at the  other end?'    'It's a rum business,' said Mike. 'I hope the dickens he won't mix us  up in it. We should look frightful fools.'    'I may possibly say a few words,' said Psmith carelessly, 'if the  spirit moves me. Who am I that I should deny people a simple pleasure?'    Mike looked alarmed.    'Look here,' he said, 'I say, if you _are_ going to play the goat,  for goodness' sake don't go lugging me into it. I've got heaps of  troubles without that.'    Psmith waved the objection aside.    'You,' he said, 'will be one of the large, and, I hope, interested  audience. Nothing more. But it is quite possible that the spirit may  not move me. I may not feel inspired to speak. I am not one of those  who love speaking for speaking's sake. If I have no message for the  many-headed, I shall remain silent.'    'Then I hope the dickens you won't have,' said Mike. Of all things he  hated most being conspicuous before a crowd--except at cricket, which  was a different thing--and he had an uneasy feeling that Psmith would  rather like it than otherwise.    'We shall see,' said Psmith absently. 'Of course, if in the vein, I  might do something big in the way of oratory. I am a plain, blunt man,  but I feel convinced that, given the opportunity, I should haul up my  slacks to some effect. But--well, we shall see. We shall see.'    And with this ghastly state of doubt Mike had to be content.    It was with feelings of apprehension that he accompanied Psmith from  the flat to Trafalgar Square in search of a cab which should convey  them to Clapham Common.    They were to meet Mr Waller at the edge of the Common nearest the  old town of Clapham. On the journey down Psmith was inclined to be  _debonnaire_. Mike, on the other hand, was silent and apprehensive.  He knew enough of Psmith to know that, if half an opportunity were  offered him, he would extract entertainment from this affair after  his own fashion; and then the odds were that he himself would be  dragged into it. Perhaps--his scalp bristled at the mere idea--he  would even be let in for a speech.    This grisly thought had hardly come into his head, when Psmith spoke.    'I'm not half sure,' he said thoughtfully, 'I sha'n't call on you for a  speech, Comrade Jackson.'    'Look here, Psmith--' began Mike agitatedly.    'I don't know. I think your solid, incisive style would rather go down  with the masses. However, we shall see, we shall see.'    Mike reached the Common in a state of nervous collapse.    Mr Waller was waiting for them by the railings near the pond. The  apostle of the Revolution was clad soberly in black, except for a tie  of vivid crimson. His eyes shone with the light of enthusiasm, vastly  different from the mild glow of amiability which they exhibited for six  days in every week. The man was transformed.    'Here you are,' he said. 'Here you are. Excellent. You are in good  time. Comrades Wotherspoon and Prebble have already begun to speak. I  shall commence now that you have come. This is the way. Over by these  trees.'    They made their way towards a small clump of trees, near which a  fair-sized crowd had already begun to collect. Evidently listening  to the speakers was one of Clapham's fashionable Sunday amusements. Mr  Waller talked and gesticulated incessantly as he walked. Psmith's  demeanour was perhaps a shade patronizing, but he displayed interest.  Mike proceeded to the meeting with the air of an about-to-be-washed dog.  He was loathing the whole business with a heartiness worthy of a better  cause. Somehow, he felt he was going to be made to look a fool before  the afternoon was over. But he registered a vow that nothing should  drag him on to the small platform which had been erected for the  benefit of the speaker.    As they drew nearer, the voices of Comrades Wotherspoon and Prebble  became more audible. They had been audible all the time, very much so,  but now they grew in volume. Comrade Wotherspoon was a tall, thin man  with side-whiskers and a high voice. He scattered his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6762"],[0,"Politics: A Treatise on Government (#15)"],[1,"kings  they used to present foreigners with the freedom of their city, to  prevent there being a want of men while they carried on long wars; it is  also affirmed that the number of Spartans was formerly ten thousand; but  be that as it will, an equality of property conduces much to increase  the number of the people. The law, too, which he made to encourage  population was by no means calculated to correct this inequality;  for being willing that the Spartans should be as numerous as [1270b]  possible, to make them desirous of having large families he ordered that  he who had three children should be excused the night-watch, and that he  who had four should pay no taxes: though it is very evident, that while  the land was divided in this manner, that if the people increased there  must many of them be very poor.    Nor was he less blamable for the manner in which he constituted the  ephori; for these magistrates take cognisance of things of the last  importance, and yet they are chosen out of the people in general; so  that it often happens that a very poor person is elected to that office,  who, from that circumstance, is easily bought. There have been many  instances of this formerly, as well as in the late affair at Andros. And  these men, being corrupted with money, went as far as they could to ruin  the city: and, because their power was too great and nearly tyrannical,  their kings were obliged to natter them, which contributed greatly to  hurt the state; so that it altered from an aristocracy to a democracy.  This magistracy is indeed the great support of the state; for the people  are easy, knowing that they are eligible to the first office in it;  so that, whether it took place by the intention of the legislator,  or whether it happened by chance, this is of great service to their  affairs; for it is necessary that every member of the state should  endeavour that each part of the government should be preserved, and  continue the same. And upon this principle their kings have always  acted, out of regard to their honour; the wise and good from their  attachment to the senate, a seat wherein they consider as the reward of  virtue; and the common people, that they may support the ephori, of whom  they consist. And it is proper that these magistrates should be chosen  out of the whole community, not as the custom is at present, which is  very ridiculous. The ephori are the supreme judges in causes of the last  consequence; but as it is quite accidental what sort of persons they may  be, it is not right that they should determine according to their own  opinion, but by a written law or established custom. Their way of life  also is not consistent with the manners of the city, for it is too  indulgent; whereas that of others is too severe; so that they cannot  support it, but are obliged privately to act contrary to law, that they  may enjoy some of the pleasures of sense. There are also great defects  in the institution of their senators. If indeed they were fitly trained  to the practice of every human virtue, every one would readily admit  that they would be useful to the government; but still it might be  debated whether they should be continued judges for life, to determine  points of the greatest moment, since the mind has its old age as well  as the body; but as they are so brought up, [1271a] that even the  legislator could not depend upon them as good men, their power must  be inconsistent with the safety of the state: for it is known that the  members of that body have been guilty both of bribery and partiality in  many public affairs; for which reason it had been much better if they  had been made answerable for their conduct, which they are not. But it  may be said the ephori seem to have a check upon all the magistrates.  They have indeed in this particular very great power; but I affirm that  they should not be entrusted with this control in the manner they are.  Moreover, the mode of choice which they make use of at the election of  their senators is very childish. Nor is it right for any one to solicit  for a place he is desirous of; for every person, whether he chooses it  or not, ought to execute any office he is fit for. But his intention was  evidently the same in this as in the other parts of his government.  For making his citizens ambitious after honours, with men of that  disposition he has filled his senate, since no others will solicit for  that office; and yet the principal part of those crimes which men are  deliberately guilty of arise from ambition and avarice.    We will inquire at another time whether the office of a king is useful  to the state: thus much is certain, that they should be chosen from a  consideration of their conduct and not as they are now. But that the  legislator himself did not expect to make all his citizens honourable  and completely virtuous is evident from this, that he distrusts them as  not being good men; for he sent those upon the same embassy that were at  variance with each other; and thought, that in the dispute of the kings  the safety of the state consisted. Neither were their common meals at  first well established: for these should rather have been provided at  the public expense, as at Crete, where, as at Lacedaemon, every one was  obliged to buy his portion, although he might be very poor, and could by  no means bear the expense, by which means the contrary happened to what  the legislator desired: for he intended that those public meals should  strengthen the democratic part of his government: but this regulation  had quite the contrary effect, for those who were very poor could not  take part in them; and it was an observation of their forefathers, that  the not allowing those who could not contribute their proportion to the  common tables to partake of them, would be the ruin of the state. Other  persons have censured his laws concerning naval affairs, and not without  reason, as it gave rise to disputes. For the commander of the fleet is  in a manner set up in opposition to the kings, who are generals of the  army for life.    [1271b] There is also another defect in his laws worthy of censure,  which Plato has given in his book of Laws; that the whole constitution  was calculated only for the business of war: it is indeed excellent to  make them conquerors; for which reason the preservation of the state  depended thereon. The destruction of it commenced with their victories:  for they knew not how to be idle, or engage in any other employment  than war. In this particular also they were mistaken, that though they  rightly thought, that those things which are the objects of contention  amongst mankind are better procured by virtue than vice, yet they  wrongfully preferred the things themselves to virtue. Nor was the public  revenue well managed at Sparta, for the state was worth nothing while  they were obliged to carry on the most extensive wars, and the subsidies  were very badly raised; for as the Spartans possessed a large extent of  country, they were not exact upon each other as to what they paid in.  And thus an event contrary to the legislator's intention took place;  for the state was poor, the individuals avaricious. Enough of the  Lacedaemonian government; for these seem the chief defects in it.          CHAPTER X      The government of Crete bears a near resemblance to this, in some few  particulars it is not worse, but in general it is far inferior in its  contrivance. For it appears and is allowed in many particulars the  constitution of Lacedaemon was formed in imitation of that of Crete;  and in general most new things are an improvement upon the old. For they  say, that when Lycurgus ceased to be guardian to King Charilles he  went abroad and spent a long time with his relations in Crete, for the  Lycians are a colony of the Lacedaemonians; and those who first settled  there adopted that body of laws which they found already established by  the inhabitants; in like manner also those who now live near them have  the very laws which Minos first drew up.    This island seems formed by nature to be the mistress of Greece, for it  is entirely surrounded by a navigable ocean which washes almost all the  maritime parts of that country, and is not far distant on the one side  from Peloponnesus, on the other, which looks towards Asia, from Triopium  and Rhodes. By means of this situation Minos acquired the empire of  the sea and the islands; some of which he subdued, in others planted  colonies: at last he died at Camicus while he was attacking Sicily.  There is this analogy between the customs of the Lacedaemonians and  the Cretans, the Helots cultivate the grounds [1272a] for the one, the  domestic slaves for the other. Both states have their common meals, and  the Lacedaemonians called these formerly not _psiditia_ but _andpia_,  as the Cretans do; which proves from whence the custom arose. In this  particular their governments are also alike: the ephori have the same  power with those of Crete, who are called _kosmoi_; with this difference  only, that the number of the one is five, of the other ten. The senators  are the same as those whom the Cretans call the council. There was  formerly also a kingly power in Crete; but it was afterwards dissolved,  and the command of their armies was given to the _kosmoi_. Every one  also has a vote in their public assembly; but this has only the power of  confirming what has already passed the council and the _kosmoi_.    The Cretans conducted their public meals better than the Lacedaemonians,  for at Lacedaemon each individual was obliged to furnish what was  assessed upon him; which if he could not do, there was a law which  deprived him of the rights of a citizen, as has been already mentioned:  but in Crete they were furnished by the community; for all the corn and  cattle, taxes and contributions, which the domestic slaves were obliged  to furnish, were divided into parts "]]]
