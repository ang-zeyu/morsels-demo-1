Once a  year I feed a teaspoonful of it to each of my people--men, women and  children--so every one of them is nearly as strong as I am. Wouldn't  YOU like a dose, sir?\" he asked, turning to the Wizard.    \"Well,\" said the Wizard, \"if you would give me a little zosozo in a  bottle, I'd like to take it with me on my travels.  It might come in  handy on occasion.\"    \"To be sure.  I'll give you enough for six doses,\" promised the  Czarover.    \"But don't take more than a teaspoonful at a time.  Once Ugu the  Shoemaker took two teaspoonsful, and it made him so strong that when he  leaned against the city wall, he pushed it over, and we had to build it  up again.\"    \"Who is Ugu the Shoemaker?\"    Button-Bright curiously, for he now remembered that the bird and the  rabbit had claimed Ugu the Shoemaker had enchanted the peach he had  eaten.    \"Why, Ugu is a great magician who used to live here.  But he's gone  away now,\" replied the Czarover.    \"Where has he gone?\" asked the Wizard quickly.    \"I am told he lives in a wickerwork castle in the mountains to the west  of here.  You see, Ugu became such a powerful magician that he didn't  care to live in our city any longer for fear we would discover some of  his secrets.  So he went to the mountains and built him a splendid  wicker castle which is so strong that even I and my people could not  batter it down, and there he lives all by himself.\"    \"This is good news,\" declared the Wizard, \"for I think this is just the  magician we are searching for.  But why is he called Ugu the Shoemaker?\"    \"Once he was a very common citizen here and made shoes for a living,\"  replied the monarch of Herku.  \"But he was descended from the greatest  wizard and sorcerer who ever lived in this or in any other country, and  one day Ugu the Shoemaker discovered all the magical books and recipes  of his famous great-grandfather, which had been hidden away in the  attic of his house.  So he began to study the papers and books and to  practice magic, and in time he became so skillful that, as I said, he  scorned our city and built a solitary castle for himself.\"    \"Do you think,\" asked Dorothy anxiously, \"that Ugu the Shoemaker would  be wicked enough to steal our Ozma of Oz?\"    \"And the Magic Picture?\" asked Trot.    \"And the Great Book of Records of Glinda the Good?\" asked Betsy.    \"And my own magic tools?\" asked the Wizard.    \"Well,\" replied the Czarover, \"I won't say that Ugu is wicked, exactly,  but he is very ambitious to become the most powerful magician in the  world, and so I suppose he would not be too proud to steal any magic  things that belonged to anybody else--if he could manage to do so.\"    \"But how about Ozma?  Why would he wish to steal HER?\" questioned  Dorothy.    \"Don't ask me, my dear.  Ugu doesn't tell me why he does things, I  assure you.\"    \"Then we must go and ask him ourselves,\" declared the little girl.    \"I wouldn't do that if I were you,\" advised the Czarover, looking first  at the three girls and then at the boy and the little Wizard and  finally at the stuffed Patchwork Girl.  \"If Ugu has really stolen your  Ozma, he will probably keep her a prisoner, in spite of all your  threats or entreaties.  And with all his magical knowledge he would be  a dangerous person to attack.  Therefore, if you are wise, you will go  home again and find a new Ruler for the Emerald City and the Land of  Oz.  But perhaps it isn't Ugu the Shoemaker who has stolen your Ozma.\"    \"The only way to settle that question,\" replied the Wizard, \"is to go  to Ugu's castle and see if Ozma is there.  If she is, we will report  the matter to the great Sorceress Glinda the Good, and I'm pretty sure  she will find a way to rescue our darling ruler from the Shoemaker.\"    \"Well, do as you please,\" said the Czarover, \"but if you are all  transformed into hummingbirds or caterpillars, don't blame me for not  warning you.\"    They stayed the rest of that day in the City of Herku and were fed at  the royal table of the Czarover and given sleeping rooms in his palace.  The strong monarch treated them very nicely and gave the Wizard a  little golden vial of zosozo to use if ever he or any of his party  wished to acquire great strength.    Even at the last, the Czarover tried to persuade them not to go near  Ugu the Shoemaker, but they were resolved on the venture, and the next  morning bade the friendly monarch a cordial goodbye and, mounting upon  their animals, left the Herkus and the City of Herku and headed for the  mountains that lay to the west.          CHAPTER 13    THE TRUTH POND      It seems a long time since we have heard anything of the Frogman and  Cayke the Cookie Cook, who had left the Yip Country in search of the  diamond-studded dishpan which had been mysteriously stolen the same  night that Ozma had disappeared from the Emerald City. But you must  remember that while the Frogman and the Cookie Cook were preparing to  descend from their mountaintop, and even while on their way to the  farmhouse of Wiljon the Winkie, Dorothy and the Wizard and their  friends were encountering the adventures we have just related.    So it was that on the very morning when the travelers from the Emerald  City bade farewell to the Czarover of the City of Herku, Cayke and the  Frogman awoke in a grove in which they had passed the night sleeping on  beds of leaves.  There were plenty of farmhouses in the neighborhood,  but no one seemed to welcome the puffy, haughty Frogman or the little  dried-up Cookie Cook, and so they slept comfortably enough underneath  the trees of the grove.  The Frogman wakened first on this morning, and  after going to the tree where Cayke slept and finding her still wrapped  in slumber, he decided to take a little walk and seek some breakfast.  Coming to the edge of the grove, he observed half a mile away a pretty  yellow house that was surrounded by a yellow picket fence, so he walked  toward this house and on entering the yard found a Winkie woman picking  up sticks with which to build a fire to cook her morning meal.    \"For goodness sake!\" she exclaimed on seeing the Frogman.  \"What are  you doing out of your frog-pond?\"    \"I am traveling in search of a jeweled gold dishpan, my good woman,\" he  replied with an air of great dignity.    \"You won't find it here, then,\" said she.  \"Our dishpans are tin, and  they're good enough for anybody.  So go back to your pond and leave me  alone.\"  She spoke rather crossly and with a lack of respect that  greatly annoyed the Frogman.    \"Allow me to tell you, madam,\" said he, \"that although I am a frog, I  am the Greatest and Wisest Frog in all the world.  I may add that I  possess much more wisdom than any Winkie--man or woman--in this land.  Wherever I go, people fall on their knees before me and render homage  to the Great Frogman!  No one else knows so much as I; no one else is  so grand, so magnificent!\"    \"If you know so much,\" she retorted, \"why don't you know where your  dishpan is instead of chasing around the country after it?\"    \"Presently,\" he answered, \"I am going where it is, but just now I am  traveling and have had no breakfast.  Therefore I honor you by asking  you for something to eat.\"    \"Oho!  The Great Frogman is hungry as any tramp, is he?  Then pick up  these sticks and help me to build the fire,\" said the woman  contemptuously.    \"Me!   The Great Frogman pick up sticks?\" he exclaimed in horror.  \"In  the Yip Country where I am more honored and powerful than any King  could be, people weep with joy when I ask them to feed me.\"    \"Then that's the place to go for your breakfast,\" declared the woman.    \"I fear you do not realize my importance,\" urged the Frogman.  \"Exceeding wisdom renders me superior to menial duties.\"    \"It's a great wonder to me,\" remarked the woman, carrying her sticks to  the house, \"that your wisdom doesn't inform you that you'll get no  breakfast here.\"  And she went in and slammed the door behind her.    The Frogman felt he had been insulted, so he gave a loud croak of  indignation and turned away.  After going a short distance, he came  upon a faint path which led across a meadow in the direction of a grove  of pretty trees, and thinking this circle of evergreens must surround a  house where perhaps he would be kindly received, he decided to follow  the path.  And by and by he came to the trees, which were set close  together, and pushing aside some branches he found no house inside the  circle, but instead a very beautiful pond of clear water.    Now the Frogman, although he was so big and well educated and now aped  the ways and customs of human beings, was still a frog.  As he gazed at  this solitary, deserted pond, his love for water returned to him with  irresistible force.  \"If I cannot get a breakfast, I may at least have  a fine swim,\" said he, and pushing his way between the trees, he  reached the bank.  There he took off his fine clothing, laying his  shiny purple hat and his gold-headed cane beside it.  A moment later,  he sprang with one leap into the water and dived to the very bottom of  the pond.    The water was deliciously cool and grateful to his thick, rough skin,  and the Frogman swam around the pond several times before he stopped to  rest.  Then he floated upon the surface and examined the pond. The  bottom and sides were all lined with glossy tiles of a light pink  color; just one place in the bottom where the water bubbled up from a  hidden spring had been left free.  On the banks, the green grass grew  to the edge of the pink tiling.  And now, as the Frogman examined the  place, he found that on one side of the pool, just above the water  line, had been set a golden plate on which some words were deeply  engraved.  He swam toward this plate, and on reaching it read the  following inscription:          _This is_      THE TRUTH POND    _Whoever bathes in this      water must always      afterward tell_        THE TRUTH.      This"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#15)"],[1,"able to make a bear's shape of a man's shape, but  the bear is stuffed with straw, just as the man was. So I feel  confident I can make a man of the bear again.\"    \"Hurrah!\" cried the Brown Bear, and tried clumsily to dance a jig of  delight.    \"As for the Tin Woodman, his case is much the same,\" resumed Ozma,  still smiling. \"The power of the Giantess could not make him anything  but a tin creature, whatever shape she transformed him into, so it will  not be impossible to restore him to his manly form. Anyhow, I shall  test my magic at once, and see if it will do what I have promised.\"    She drew from her bosom a small silver Wand and, making passes with the  Wand over the head of the Bear, she succeeded in the brief space of a  moment in breaking his enchantment. The original Scarecrow of Oz again  stood before them, well stuffed with straw and with his features nicely  painted upon the bag which formed his head.    The Scarecrow was greatly delighted, as you may suppose, and he  strutted proudly around while the powerful fairy, Ozma of Oz, broke the  enchantment that had transformed the Tin Woodman and made a Tin Owl  into a Tin Man again.    \"Now, then,\" chirped the Canary, eagerly; \"I'm next, Ozma!\"    \"But your case is different,\" replied Ozma, no longer smiling but  wearing a grave expression on her sweet face. \"I shall have to  experiment on you, Polychrome, and I may fail in all my attempts.\"    She then tried two or three different methods of magic, hoping one of  them would succeed in breaking Polychrome's enchantment, but still the  Rainbow's Daughter remained a Canary-Bird. Finally, however, she  experimented in another way. She transformed the Canary into a Dove,  and then transformed the Dove into a Speckled Hen, and then changed the  Speckled Hen into a rabbit, and then the rabbit into a Fawn. And at the  last, after mixing several powders and sprinkling them upon the Fawn,  the yookoohoo enchantment was suddenly broken and before them stood one  of the daintiest and loveliest creatures in any fairyland in the world.  Polychrome was as sweet and merry in disposition as she was beautiful,  and when she danced and capered around in delight, her beautiful hair  floated around her like a golden mist and her many-hued raiment, as  soft as cobwebs, reminded one of drifting clouds in a summer sky.    Woot was so awed by the entrancing sight of this exquisite Sky Fairy  that he quite forgot his own sad plight until be noticed Ozma gazing  upon him with an intent expression that denoted sympathy and sorrow.  Dorothy whispered in her friend's ear, but the Ruler of Oz shook her  head sadly.    Jinjur, noticing this and understanding Ozma's looks, took the paw of  the Green Monkey in her own hand and patted it softly.    \"Never mind,\" she said to him. \"You are a very beautiful color, and a  monkey can climb better than a boy and do a lot of other things no boy  can ever do.\"    \"What's the matter?\" asked Woot, a sinking feeling at his heart. \"Is  Ozma's magic all used up?\"    Ozma herself answered him.    \"Your form of enchantment, my poor boy,\" she said pityingly, \"is  different from that of the others. Indeed, it is a form that is  impossible to alter by any magic known to fairies or yookoohoos. The  wicked Giantess was well aware, when she gave you the form of a Green  Monkey, that the Green Monkey must exist in the Land of Oz for all  future time.\"    Woot drew a long sigh.    \"Well, that's pretty hard luck,\" he said bravely, \"but if it can't be  helped I must endure it; that's all. I don't like being a monkey, but  what's the use of kicking against my fate?\"    They were all very sorry for him, and Dorothy anxiously asked Ozma:    \"Couldn't Glinda save him?\"    \"No,\" was the reply. \"Glinda's power in transformations is no greater  than my own. Before I left my palace I went to my Magic Room and  studied Woot's case very carefully. I found that no power can do away  with the Green Monkey. He might transfer, or exchange his form with  some other person, it is true; but the Green Monkey we cannot get rid  of by any magic arts known to science.\"    \"But--see here,\" said the Scarecrow, who had listened intently to this  explanation, \"why not put the monkey's form on some one else?\"    \"Who would agree to make the change?\" asked Ozma. \"If by force we  caused anyone else to become a Green Monkey, we would be as cruel and  wicked as Mrs. Yoop. And what good would an exchange do?\" she  continued. \"Suppose, for instance, we worked the enchantment, and made  Toto into a Green Monkey. At the same moment Woot would become a little  dog.\"    \"Leave me out of your magic, please,\" said Toto, with a reproachful  growl. \"I wouldn't become a Green Monkey for anything.\"    \"And I wouldn't become a dog,\" said Woot. \"A green monkey is much  better than a dog, it seems to me.\"    \"That is only a matter of opinion,\" answered Toto.    \"Now, here's another idea,\" said the Scarecrow. \"My brains are working  finely today, you must admit. Why not transform Toto into Woot the  Wanderer, and then have them exchange forms? The dog would become a  green monkey and the monkey would have his own natural shape again.\"    \"To be sure!\" cried Jinjur. \"That's a fine idea.\"    \"Leave me out of it,\" said Toto. \"I won't do it.\"    \"Wouldn't you be willing to become a green monkey--see what a pretty  color it is--so that this poor boy could be restored to his own shape?\"  asked Jinjur, pleadingly.    \"No,\" said Toto.    \"I don't like that plan the least bit,\" declared Dorothy, \"for then I  wouldn't have any little dog.\"    \"But you'd have a green monkey in his place,\" persisted Jinjur, who  liked Woot and wanted to help him.    \"I don't want a green monkey,\" said Dorothy positively.    \"Don't speak of this again, I beg of you,\" said Woot. \"This is my own  misfortune and I would rather suffer it alone than deprive Princess  Dorothy of her dog, or deprive the dog of his proper shape. And perhaps  even her Majesty, Ozma of Oz, might not be able to transform anyone  else into the shape of Woot the Wanderer.\"    \"Yes; I believe I might do that,\" Ozma returned; \"but Woot is quite  right; we are not justified in inflicting upon anyone--man or dog--the  form of a green monkey. Also it is certain that in order to relieve the  boy of the form he now wears, we must give it to someone else, who  would be forced to wear it always.\"    \"I wonder,\" said Dorothy, thoughtfully, \"if we couldn't find someone in  the Land of Oz who would be willing to become a green monkey? Seems to  me a monkey is active and spry, and he can climb trees and do a lot of  clever things, and green isn't a bad color for a monkey--it makes him  unusual.\"    \"I wouldn't ask anyone to take this dreadful form,\" said Woot; \"it  wouldn't be right, you know. I've been a monkey for some time, now, and  I don't like it. It makes me ashamed to be a beast of this sort when by  right of birth I'm a boy; so I'm sure it would be wicked to ask anyone  else to take my place.\"    They were all silent, for they knew he spoke the truth. Dorothy was  almost ready to cry with pity and Ozma's sweet face was sad and  disturbed. The Scarecrow rubbed and patted his stuffed head to try to  make it think better, while the Tin Woodman went into the house and  began to oil his tin joints so that the sorrow of his friends might not  cause him to weep. Weeping is liable to rust tin, and the Emperor  prided himself upon his highly polished body--now doubly dear to him  because for a time he had been deprived of it.    Polychrome had danced down the garden paths and back again a dozen  times, for she was seldom still a moment, yet she had heard Ozma's  speech and understood very well Woot's unfortunate position. But the  Rainbow's Daughter, even while dancing, could think and reason very  clearly, and suddenly she solved the problem in the nicest possible  way. Coming close to Ozma, she said:    \"Your Majesty, all this trouble was caused by the wickedness of Mrs.  Yoop, the Giantess. Yet even now that cruel woman is living in her  secluded castle, enjoying the thought that she has put this terrible  enchantment on Woot the Wanderer. Even now she is laughing at our  despair because we can find no way to get rid of the green monkey. Very  well, we do not wish to get rid of it. Let the woman who created the  form wear it herself, as a just punishment for her wickedness. I am  sure your fairy power can give to Mrs. Yoop the form of Woot the  Wanderer--even at this distance from her--and then it will be possible  to exchange the two forms. Mrs. Yoop will become the Green Monkey, and  Woot will recover his own form again.\"    Ozma's face brightened as she listened to this clever proposal.    \"Thank you, Polychrome,\" said she. \"The task you propose is not so easy  as you suppose, but I will make the attempt, and perhaps I may succeed.\"          Chapter Fourteen    The Green Monkey      They now entered the house, and as an interested group, watched Jinjur,  at Ozma's command, build a fire and put a kettle of water over to boil.  The Ruler of Oz stood before the fire silent and grave, while the  others, realizing that an important ceremony of magic was about to be  performed, stood quietly in the background so as not to interrupt  Ozma's proceedings. Only Polychrome kept going in and coming out,  humming softly to herself as she danced, for the Rainbow's Daughter  could not keep still for long, and the four walls of a room always made  her nervous and ill at ease. She moved so noiselessly, however, that  her movements were like the shifting of sunbeams and did not annoy  anyone.    When the water in the kettle bubbled, Ozma drew from her bosom two tiny  packets containing powders. These powders she threw into the kettle and  after briskly stirring the contents with a branch from a macaroon bush,  Ozma poured the mystic broth upon a broad platter which Jinjur had  placed upon the table.
