Cutting a cross  section from the woolen undershirt which covered his muscular arm, he  made a rude cap of it, and threw away his bloody coat. This has since  been found in the woods, and blood has been found also on his bosom and  sleeves. He also spattered himself plentifully with mud and clay, and,  taking an abandoned pick from the deserted intrenchments near by, he  struck at once for Washington.    By the providence which always attends murder, he reached Mrs. Surratt's  door just as the officers of the government were arresting her. They  seized Payne at once, who had an awkward lie to urge in his  defense--that he had come there to dig a trench. That night he dug a  trench deep and broad enough for both of them to lie in forever. They  washed his hands, and found them soft and womanish; his pockets  contained tooth and nail brushes and a delicate pocket knife. All this  apparel consorted ill with his assumed character. He is, without doubt,  Mr. Seward's attempted murderer.    Coarse, and hard, and calm, Mrs. Surratt shut up her house after the  murder, and waited with her daughters till the officers came. She was  imperturbable, and rebuked her girls for weeping, and would have gone to  jail like a statue, but that in her extremity, Payne knocked at her  door. He had come, he said, to dig a ditch for Mrs. Surratt, whom he  very well knew. But Mrs. Surratt protested that she had ever seen the  man at all, and had no ditch to clean.    \"How fortunate, girls,\" she said, \"that these officers are here; this  man might have murdered us all.\"    Her effrontery stamps her as worthy of companionship with Booth. Payne  has been identified by a lodger of Mrs. Surratt's, as having twice  visited the house under the name of Wood. The girls will render valuable  testimony in the trial. If John Surratt were in custody the links would  be complete.    Atzerott had a room almost directly over Vice-President Johnson's. He  had all the materials to do murder, but lost spirit or opportunity. He  ran away so hastily that all his arms and baggage were discovered; a  tremendous bowie-knife and a Colt's cavalry revolver were found between  the mattresses of his bed. Booth's coat was also found there, showing  conspired flight in company, and in it three boxes of cartridges, a map  of Maryland, gauntlet for riding, a spur and a handkerchief marked with  the name of Booth's mother--a mother's souvenir for a murderer's pocket!    Atzerott fled alone, and was found at the house of his uncle in  Montgomery county. I do not know that any instrument of murder has ever  made me thrill as when I drew this terrible bowie-knife from its sheath.  Major O'Bierne, of New-York, was the instigator of Atzerott's discovery  and arrest.    I come now to the ride out of the city by the chief assassin and his  dupe. Harold met Booth immediately after the crime in the next street,  and they rode at a gallop past the Patent Office and over Capitol Hill.    As they crossed the Eastern branch at Uniontown, Booth gave his proper  name to the officer at the bridge. This, which would seem to have been  foolish, was, in reality, very shrewd. The officers believed that one of  Booth's accomplices had given this name in order to put them out of the  real Booth's track. So they made efforts elsewhere, and so Booth got a  start. At midnight, precisely, the two horsemen stopped at  Surrattsville, Booth remaining on his nag while Harold descended and  knocked lustily at the door. Lloyd, the landlord, came down at once,  when Harold pushed past him into the bar, and obtained a bottle of  whiskey, some of which he gave to Booth immediately. While Booth was  drinking, Harold went up stairs and brought down one of the carbines.  Lloyd started to get the other, but Harold said:    \"We don't want it; Booth has broken his leg and can't carry it.\"    So the second carbine remained in the hall, where the officers afterward  found it.    As the two horsemen started to go off, Booth cried out to Lloyd:    \"Do you want to hear some news?\"    \"I don't care much about it,\" cried Lloyd, by his own account.    \"We have murdered,\" said Booth, \"the President and Secretary of State!\"    And with this horrible confession, Booth and Harold dashed away in the  midnight, across Prince George's county.    On Saturday, before sunrise, Booth and Harold, who had ridden all night  without stopping elsewhere, reached the house of Dr. Mudd, three miles  from Bryantown. They contracted with him for twenty-five dollars in  greenbacks to set the broken leg. Harold, who knew Dr. Mudd, introduced  Booth under another name, and stated that he had fallen from his horse  during the night. The doctor remarked of Booth that he draped the lower  part of his face while the leg was being set; he was silent, and in  pain. Having no splits in the house, they split up an old-fashioned  wooden band-box and prepared them. The doctor was assisted by an  Englishman, who at the same time began to hew out a pair of crutches.  The inferior bone of the left leg was broken vertically across, and  because vertically it did not yield when the crippled man walked upon  it.    The riding boot of Booth had to be cut from his foot; within were the  words \"J. Wilkes.\" The doctor says he did not notice these, but that  visual defect may cost him his neck. The two men waited around the house  all day, but toward evening they slipped their horses from the stable  and rode away in the direction of Allen's Fresh.    Below Bryantown run certain deep and slimy swamps, along the belt of  these Booth and Harold picked up a negro named Swan, who volunteered to  show them the road for two dollars; they gave him five more to show them  the route to Allen's Fresh, but really wished, as their actions  intimated, to gain the house of one Sam. Coxe, a notorious rebel, and  probably well advised of the plot. They reached the house at midnight.  It is a fine dwelling, one of the best in Maryland. And after hallooing  for some time, Coxe came down to the door himself. As soon as he opened  it and beheld who the strangers were, he instantly blew out a candle he  held in his hand, and without a word pulled them into the house, the  negro remaining in the yard. The confederates remained in Coxe's house  till 4 A. M., during which time, the negro saw them drink and eat  heartily; but when they reappeared they spoke in a loud tone, so that  Swan could hear them, against the hospitality of Coxe. All this was  meant to influence the darkey; but their motives were as apparent as  their words. He conducted them three miles further on, when they told  him that now they knew the way, and giving him five dollars more--making  twelve in all--told him to go back.    But when the negro, in the dusk of the morning, looked after them as he  receded, he saw that both horses' heads were turned once more toward  Coxe's, and it was this man, doubtless, who harbored the fugitives from  Sunday to Thursday, aided, possibly, by such neighbors as the Wilsons  and Adamses.    At the point where Booth crossed the Potomac the shores are very  shallow, and one must wade out some distance to where a boat will float.  A white man came up here with a canoe on Friday, and tied it by a stone  anchor. Between seven and eight o'clock it disappeared, and in the  afternoon some men at work in Virginia, saw Booth and Harold land, tie  the boat's rope to a stone, and fling it ashore, and strike at once  across a ploughed field for King George Court House. Many folks  entertained them without doubt, but we positively hear of them next at  Port Royal Ferry, and then at Garrett's farm.

Washington, May 2--P. M.    The police resources of the country have been fairly tested during the  past two weeks. Under the circumstances, the shrewdness and energy of  both municipal and national detectives have been proven good. The latter  body has had a too partial share of the applause thus far, while the  great efforts of our New-York and other officers have been overlooked.  In the crowning success of Doherty, Conger, and Baker on the Virginia  side of the water we have forgotten the as vigorous and better sustained  pursuit on the Maryland side.    Yet the Secretary of War has thanked all concerned, especially referring  to many excellent leaders in the long hunt through Charles and St.  Mary's counties. Here the military and civil forces together amounted to  quite a small army, and constituted by far the largest police  organization ever known on this side of the Atlantic.    I think the adventures and expedients of these public servants worthy of  a column. It would be out of all proportion to pass them by when we  devote a dozen lines to every petty larceny and shoplifting.

Except for the interference of the moon, we should probably  never have known that there is any more of the sun than our eyes  ordinarily see.    But when an eclipse of the sun occurs, caused by the interposition of  the opaque globe of the moon, we see its immediate surroundings, which  in some respects are more wonderful than the glowing central orb.  These surroundings, although not in the sense in which we apply the  term to the gaseous envelope of the earth, may be called the sun's  atmosphere. They consist of two very different parts -- first, the red  ``prominences,'' which resemble tongues of flame ascending thousands  of miles above the sun's surface; and, second, the ``corona,'' which  extends to distances of millions of miles from the sun, and shines  with a soft, glowing light. The two combined, when well seen, make a  spectacle without parallel among the marvels of the sky. Although many  attempts have been made to render the corona visible when there is no  eclipse, all have failed, and it is to the moon alone that we owe its  revelation. To cover the sun's disk with a circular screen will not  answer the purpose because of the illumination of the air all about  the observer. When the moon hides the sun, on the other hand, the  sunlight is withdrawn from a great cylinder of air extending to the  top of the atmosphere and spreading many miles around the observer.  There is then no glare to interfere with the spectacle, and the corona  appears in all its surprising beauty. The prominences, however,  although they were discovered during an eclipse, can now, with the aid  of the spectroscope, be seen at any time. But the prominences are  rarely large enough to be noticed by the naked eye, while the  streamers of the corona, stretching far away in space, like ghostly  banners blown out from the black circle of the obscuring moon, attract  every eye, and to this weird apparition much of the fear inspired by  eclipses has been due. But if the corona has been a cause of terror in  the past it has become a source of growing knowledge in our time.    The story of the first scientific observation of the corona and the  prominences is thrillingly interesting, and in fact dramatic. The  observation was made during the eclipse of 1842, which fortunately was  visible all over Central and Southern Europe so that scores of  astronomers saw it. The interest centers in what happened at Pavia in  Northern Italy, where the English astronomer Francis Baily had set up  his telescope. The eclipse had begun and Bailey was busy at his  telescope when, to quote his own words in the account which he wrote  for the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society:      I was astounded by a tremendous burst of applause from the streets    below, and at the same moment was electrified by the sight of one    of the most brilliant and splendid phenomena that can well be    imagined; for at that instant the dark body of the moon was    suddenly surrounded with a corona, or kind of bright glory, similar    in shape and magnitude to that which painters draw round the heads    of saints...      Pavia contains many thousand inhabitants, the major part of whom    were at this early hour walking about the streets and squares or    looking out of windows in order to witness this long-talked-of    phenomenon; and when the total obscuration took place, which was    instantaneous, there was a universal shout from every observer    which ``made the welkin ring,'' and for the moment withdrew my    attention from the object with which I was immediately occupied. I    had, indeed, expected the appearance of a luminous circle round the    moon during the time of total obscurity; but I did not expect, from    any of the accounts of preceding eclipses that I had read, to    witness so magnificent an exhibition as that which took place...      Splendid and astonishing, however, as this remarkable phenomenon    really was, and although it could not fail to call forth the    admiration and applause of every beholder, yet I must confess that    there was at the same time something in its singular and wonderful    appearance that was appalling...      But the most remarkable circumstance attending the phenomenon was    the appearance of three large protuberances apparently emanating    from the circumference of the moon, but evidently forming a portion    of the corona. They had the appearance of mountains of a prodigious    elevation; their color was red tinged with lilac or purple; perhaps    the color of the peach-blossom would more nearly represent it. They    somewhat resembled the tops of the snowy Alpine mountains when    colored by the rising or the setting sun. They resembled the Alpine    mountains in another respect, inasmuch as their light was perfectly    steady, and had none of that flickering or sparkling motion so    visible in other parts of the corona...      The whole of these protuberances were visible even to the last    moment of total obscuration, and when the first ray of light was    admitted from the sun they vanished, with the corona, altogether,    and daylight was instantly restored.    I have quoted nearly all of this remarkable description not alone for  its intrinsic interest, but because it is the best depiction that can  be found of the general phenomena of a total solar eclipse. Still, not  every such eclipse offers an equally magnificent spectacle. The  eclipses of 1900 and 1905, for instance, which were seen by the  writer, the first in South Carolina and the second in Spain, fell far  short of that described by Bailey in splendor and impressiveness. Of  course, something must be allowed for the effect of surprise; Bailey  had not expected to see what was so suddenly disclosed to him. But  both in 1900 and 1905 the amount of scattered light in the sky was  sufficient in itself to make the corona appear faint, and there were  no very conspicuous prominences visible. Yet on both occasions there  was manifest among the spectators that mingling of admiration and awe  of which Bailey speaks. The South Carolinians gave a cheer and the  ladies waved their handkerchiefs when the corona, ineffably delicate  of form and texture, melted into sight and then in two minutes melted  away again. The Spaniards, crowded on the citadel hill of Burgos, with  their king and his royal retinue in their midst, broke out with a  great clapping of hands as the awaited spectacle unfolded itself in  the sky; and on both occasions, before the applause began, after an  awed silence a low murmur ran through the crowds. At Burgos it is said  many made the sign of the cross.    It was not long before Bailey's idea that the prominences were a part  of the corona was abandoned, and it was perceived that the two  phenomena were to a great extent independent. At the eclipse of 1868,  which the astronomers, aroused by the wonderful scene of 1842, and  eager to test the powers of the newly invented spectroscope, flocked  to India to witness, Janssen conceived the idea of employing the  spectroscope to render the prominences visible when there was no  eclipse. He succeeded the very next day, and these phenomena have been  studied in that way ever since.    There are recognized two kinds of prominences -- the ``erruptive'' and  the ``quiescent.'' The latter, which are cloud-like in form, may be  seen almost anywhere along the edge of the sun; but the former, which  often shoot up as if hurled from mighty volcanoes, appear to be  associated with sun-spots, and appear only above the zones where spots  abound. Either of them, when seen in projection against the brilliant  solar disk, appears white, not red, as against a background of sky.  The quiescent prominences, whose elevation is often from forty  thousand to sixty thousand miles, consist, as the spectroscope shows,  mainly of hydrogen and helium. The latter, it will be remembered, is  an element which was known to be in the sun many years before the  discovery that it also exists in small quantities on the earth. A fact  which may have a significance which we cannot at present see is that  the emanation from radium gradually and spontaneously changes into  helium, an alchemistical feat of nature that has opened many curious  vistas to speculative thinkers. The eruptive prominences, which do not  spread horizontally like the others, but ascend with marvelous  velocity to elevations of half a million miles or more, are apparently  composed largely of metallic vapors -- i.e. metals which are usually  solid on the earth, but which at solar temperatures are kept in a  volatilized state. The velocity of their ascent occasionally amounts  to three hundred or four hundred miles per second. It is known from  mathematical considerations that the gravitation of the sun would not  be able to bring back any body that started from its surface with a  velocity exceeding three hundred and eighty-three miles per second; so  it is evident that some of the matter hurled forth in eruptive  prominences may escape from solar control and go speeding out into  space, cooling and condensing into solid masses. There seems to be no  reason why some of the projectiles from the sun might not reach the  planets. Here, then, we have on a relatively small scale, explosions  recalling those which it has been imagined may be the originating  cause of some of the sudden phenomena of the stellar heavens.    Of the sun-spots it is not our intention here specifically to speak,  but they evidently have an intimate connection with eruptive  prominences, as well as some relation, not yet fully understood, with  the corona. Of the real cause of sun-spots we know virtually nothing,  but recent studies by Professor Hale and others have revealed a  strange state of things in the clouds of metallic vapors floating  above them and their surroundings. Evidences of a cyclonic tendency  have been found, and Professor Hale has proved that sun-spots are  "]]]
