Never was he plunged into despair until after the dread crisis  had come to pass. His red forehead, frowning and ridged with swelling  blood-vessels, showed the bent of his mind.    \"Oh, it is hard!\" said Lenore to Dorn. \"I'm so sorry! But don't give up.  While there's life there's hope!\"    He looked up with tears in his eyes.    \"Thank you.... I did weaken. You see I've let myself believe too  much--for dad's sake. I don't care about the money for myself.... Money!  What good will money be to me--now? It's over for me.... To get the  wheat cut--harvested--that's all I hoped.... The army--war--France--I go  to be--\"    \"Hush!\" whispered Lenore, and she put a soft hand upon his lips,  checking the end of that bitter speech. She felt him start, and the look  she met pierced her soul. \"Hush!... It's going to rain!... Father will  find some way to save the wheat!... And you are coming home--after the  war!\"    He crushed her hand to his hot lips.    \"You make me--ashamed. I won't give--up,\" he said, brokenly. \"And when  I'm over--there--in the trenches, I'll think--\"    \"Dorn, listen to this,\" rang out Anderson. \"We'll fool that I.W.W.  gang....It's a-goin' to rain. So far so good. To-morrow you take this  cake of phosphorus an' ride around all over the country. Show it an'  tell the farmers their wheat's goin' to burn. An' offer them whose  fields are already ruined--that fire can't do no more harm--offer them  big money to help you save your section. Half a hundred men could put  out a fire if one did start. An' these neighbors of yours, some of them  will jump at a chance to beat the I.W.W.... Boy, it can be done!\"    He ended with a big fist held aloft in triumph.    \"See! Didn't I tell you?\" murmured Lenore, softly. It touched her deeply  to see Dorn respond to hope. His haggard face suddenly warmed and  glowed.    \"I never thought of that,\" he burst out, radiantly. \"We can save the  wheat.... Mr. Anderson, I--I can't thank you enough.\"    \"Don't try,\" replied the rancher.    \"I tell you it will rain,\" cried Lenore, gaily. \"Let's walk out  there--watch the storm come across the hills. I love to see the shadows  blow over the wheat.\"    Lenore became aware, as she passed the car, that Nash was glaring at her  in no unmistakable manner. She had forgotten all about him. The sight of  his jealous face somehow added to her strange exhilaration.    They crossed the road from the house, and, facing the west, had free  prospect of the miles of billowy hills and the magnificent ordnance of  the storm-clouds. The deep, low mutterings of thunder seemed a grand and  welcome music. Lenore stole a look at Dorn, to see him, bareheaded, face  upturned, entranced. It was only a rain-storm coming! Down in the valley  country such storms were frequent at this season, too common for their  meaning to be appreciated. Here in the desert of wheat rain was a  blessing, life itself.    The creamy-white, rounded edge of the approaching clouds came and  coalesced, spread and mushroomed. Under them the body of the storm was  purple, lit now and then by a flash of lightning. Long, drifting veils  of rain, gray as thin fog, hung suspended between sky and earth.    \"Listen!\" exclaimed Dorn.    A warm wind, laden with dry scent of wheat, struck Lenore's face and  waved her hair. It brought a silken, sweeping rustle, a whispering of  the bearded grain. The soft sound thrilled Lenore. It seemed a sweet,  hopeful message that waiting had been rewarded, that the drought could  be broken. Again, and more beautiful than ever before in her life, she  saw the waves of shadow as they came forward over the wheat. Rippling,  like breezes over the surface of a golden lake, they came in long,  broken lines, moving, following, changing, until the whole wheat-field  seemed in shadowy motion.    The cloud pageant rolled on above and beyond. Lenore felt a sweet drop  of rain splash upon her upturned face. It seemed like a caress. There  came a pattering around her. Suddenly rose a damp, faint smell of dust.  Beyond the hill showed a gray pall of rain, coming slowly, charged with  a low roar. The whisper of the sweeping wheat was swallowed up.    Lenore stood her ground until heavy rain drops fell thick and fast upon  her, sinking through her thin waist to thrill her flesh; and then, with  a last gay call to those two man lovers of wheat and storms, she ran for  the porch.    There they joined her, Anderson puffing and smiling, Dorn still with  that rapt look upon his face. The rain swept up and roared on the roof,  while all around was streaked gray.    \"Boy, there's your thirty-thousand-dollar rain!\" shouted Anderson.    But Dorn did not hear. Once he smiled at Lenore as if she were the good  fairy who had brought about this miracle. In his look Lenore had deeper  realization of him, of nature, and of life. She loved rain, but always,  thenceforth, she would reverence it. Fresh, cool fragrance of a renewed  soil filled the air. All that dusty gray hue of the earth had vanished,  and it was wet and green and bright. Even as she gazed the water seemed  to sink in as it fell, a precious relief to thirsty soil. The thunder  rolled away eastward and the storm passed. The thin clouds following  soon cleared away from the western sky, rain-washed and blue, with a  rainbow curving down to bury its exquisite hues in the golden wheat.          CHAPTER VIII    The journey homeward held many incalculable differences from the  uncertain doubts and fears that had tormented Lenore on the outward  trip.    For a long time she felt the warm, tight clasp of Dorn's hand on hers as  he had said good-by. Very evidently he believed that was to be his last  sight of her. Lenore would never forget the gaze that seemed to try to  burn her image on his memory forever. She felt that they would meet  again. Solemn thoughts revolved in her mind; still, she was not unhappy.  She had given much unsought, but the return to her seemed growing every  moment that she lived.    The dust had been settled by the rain for many miles; however, beyond  Palmer there began to show evidences that the storm had thinned out or  sheered off, because the road gradually grew dry again. When dust rose  once more Lenore covered her face, although, obsessed as she was by the  deep change in herself, neither dust nor heat nor distance affected her  greatly. Like the miles the moments sped by. She was aware through  closed eyes when darkness fell. Stops were frequent after the Copper  River had been crossed, and her father appeared to meet and question  many persons in the towns they passed. Most of his questioning pertained  to the I.W.W. And even excited whispering by her father and Jake had no  power to interest her. It was midnight when they reached \"Many Waters\"  and Lenore became conscious of fatigue.    Nash crowded in front of Jake as she was about to step out, and assisted  her. He gave her arm a hard squeeze and fiercely whispered in her ear,  \"To-morrow!\"    The whisper was trenchant with meaning and thoroughly aroused Lenore.  But she gave no sign and moved away.    \"I seen strangers sneakin' off in the dark,\" Jake was whispering to  Anderson.    \"Keep your eyes peeled,\" replied Anderson. \"I'll take Lenore up to the  house an' come back.\"    It was pitch black up the path through the grove and Lenore had to cling  to her father.    \"Is there--any danger?\" she whispered.    \"We're lookin' for anythin',\" replied Anderson, slowly.    \"Will you be careful?\"    \"Sure, lass. I'll take no foolish risks. I've got men watchin' the house  an' ranch. But I'd better have the cowboys down. There's Jake--he spots  some prowlin' coyotes the minute we reach home.\"    Anderson unlocked and opened the door. The hall was dark and quiet. He  turned on the electric light. Lenore was detaching her veil.    \"You look pale,\" he said, solicitously. \"No wonder. That was a ride. But  I'm glad we went. I saved Dorn's wheat.\"    \"I'm glad, too, father. Good-night!\"    He bade her good-night, and went out, locking the door. Then his rapid  footsteps died away. Wearily Lenore climbed the stairs and went to her  room.           *       *       *       *       *    She was awakened from deep slumber by Kathleen, who pulled and tugged at  her.    \"Lenorry, I thought you was dead, your eyes were shut so tight,\"  declared the child. \"Breakfast is waiting. Did you fetch me anything?\"    \"Yes, a new sister,\" replied Lenore, dreamily.    Kathleen's eyes opened wide. \"Where?\"    Lenore place a hand over her heart.    \"Here.\"    \"Oh, you do look funny.... Get up, Lenorry. Did you hear the shooting  last night?\"    Instantly Lenore sat up and stared.    \"No. Was there any?\"    \"You bet. But I don't know what it was all about.\"    Lenore dispelled her dreamy state, and, hurriedly dressing, she went  down to breakfast. Her father and Rose were still at the table.    \"Hello, big eyes!\" was his greeting.    And Rose, not to be outdone, chirped, \"Hello, old sleepy-head!\"    Lenore's reply lacked her usual spontaneity. And she felt, if she did  not explain, the wideness of her eyes. Her father did not look as if  anything worried him. It was a way of his, however, not to show stress  or worry. Lenore ate in silence until Rose left the dining-room, and  then she asked her father if there had been shooting.    \"Sure,\" he replied, with a broad smile. \"Jake turned his guns loose on  them prowlin' men last night. By George! you ought to have heard them  run. One plumped into the gate an' went clear over it, to fall like a  log. Another fell into the brook an' made more racket than a drownin'  horse. But it was so dark we couldn't catch them.\"    \"Jake shot to frighten them?\" inquired Lenore.    \"Not much. He stung one I.W.W., that's sure. We heard a cry, an' this  mornin' we found some blood.\"    \"What do you suppose these--these night visitors wanted?\"    \"No tellin'. Jake thinks one of them "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],[0,"Town Geology (#16)"],[1,"special food,   and which they do not get on our dry pastures, and still less in our   cultivated fields.  But in these islands there are two noble species,   at least, which are true swamp-ferns; the Lastraea Thelypteris, which   of old filled the fens, but is now all but extinct; and the Osmunda,   or King-fern, which, as all know, will grow wherever it is damp   enough about the roots.  In Hampshire, in Devon, and Cornwall, and in   the southwest of Ireland, the King-fern too is a true swamp fern.    But in the Tropics I have seen more than once noble tree-ferns   growing in wet savannahs at the sea-level, as freely as in the   mountain-woods; ferns with such a stem as some of the coal ferns had,   some fifteen feet in height, under which, as one rode on horseback,   one saw the blazing blue sky, as through a parasol of delicate lace,   as men might have long ages since have seen it, through the plumed   fronds of the ferns now buried in the coal, had there only been a man   then created to enjoy its beauty.    Next we find plants called by geologists Calamites.  There is no   doubt now that they are of the same family as our Equiseta, or horse-  tails, a race which has, over most parts of the globe, dwindled down   now from twenty or thirty feet in height, as they were in the old   coal measures, to paltry little weeds.  The tallest Equisetum in   England--the beautiful E. Telmateia--is seldom five feet high.  But   they, too, are mostly mud and swamp plants; and so may the Calamites   have been.    The Lepidodendrons, again, are without doubt the splendid old   representatives of a family now dwindled down to such creeping things   as our club-mosses, or Lycopodiums.  Now it is a certain fact, which   can be proved by the microscope, that a very great part of the best   coal is actually made up of millions of the minute seeds of club-  mosses, such as grow--a few of them, and those very small--on our   moors; a proof, surely, not only of the vast amount of the vegetation   in the coal-making age, but also of the vast time during which it   lasted.  The Lepidodendra may have been fifty or sixty feet high.    There is not a Lycopodium in the world now, I believe, five feet   high.  But the club-mosses are now, in these islands and elsewhere,   lovers of wet and peaty soils, and so may their huger prototypes have   been, in the old forests of the coal.    Of the Sigillariae we cannot say as much with certainty, for   botanists are not agreed as to what low order of flowerless plants   they belong.  But that they rooted in clay beds there is proof, as   you will hear presently.    And as to the Conifers, or pine-like trees--the Dadoxylon, of which   the pith goes by the name of Sternbergia, and the uncertain tree   which furnishes in some coal-measures bushels of a seed connected   with that of the yew--we may suppose that they would find no more   difficulty in growing in swamps than the cypress, which forms so   large a portion of the vegetation in the swamps of the Southern   United States.    I have given you these hints, because you will naturally wish to know   what sort of a world it was in which all these strange plants grew   and turned into coal.    My answer is, that it was most probably just like the world in which   we are living now, with the one exception that the plants and animals   are different.    It was the fashion a few years since to explain the coal--like other   phenomena of geology--by some mere hypothesis of a state of things   quite unlike what we see now.  We were brought up to believe that in   the Carboniferous, or coal-bearing era, the atmosphere was intensely   moist and hot, and overcharged with carbonic acid, which had been   poured out from the interior of the planet by volcanic eruptions, or   by some other convulsion.  I forget most of it now:  and really there   is no need to remember; for it is all, I verily believe, a dream--an   attempt to explain the unknown not by the known, but by the still   more unknown.  You may find such theories lingering still in   sensational school-books, if you like to be unscientific.  If you   like, on the other hand, to be scientific you will listen to those   who tell you that instead of there having been one unique   carboniferous epoch, with a peculiar coal-making climate, all epochs   are carboniferous if they get the chance; that coal is of every age,   from that of the Scotch and English beds, up to the present day.  The   great coal-beds along the Rocky Mountains, for instance, are   tertiary--that is, later than the chalk.  Coal is forming now, I   doubt not, in many places on the earth, and would form in many more,   if man did not interfere with the processes of wild nature, by   draining the fens, and embanking the rivers.    Let me by a few words prove this statement.  They will give you,   beside, a fresh proof of Sir Charles Lyell's great geological rule--  that the best way to explain what we see in ancient rocks is to take   for granted, as long as we can do so fairly, that things were going   on then very much as they are going on now.    When it was first seen that coal had been once vegetable, the   question arose--How did all these huge masses of vegetable matter get   there?  The Yorkshire and Derbyshire coal-fields, I hear, cover 700   or 800 square miles; the Lancashire about 200.  How large the North   Wales and the Scotch fields are I cannot say.  But doubtless a great   deal more coal than can be got at lies under the sea, especially in   the north of Wales.  Coal probably exists over vast sheets of England   and France, buried so deeply under later rocks, that it cannot be   reached by mining.  As an instance, a distinguished geologist has   long held that there are beds of coal under London itself, which   rise, owing to a peculiar disturbance of the strata, to within 1,000   or 1,200 feet of the surface, and that we or our children may yet see   coal-mines in the marshes of the Thames.  And more, it is a provable   fact that only a portion of the coal measures is left.  A great part   of Ireland must once have been covered with coal, which is now   destroyed.  Indeed, it is likely that the coal now known of in Europe   and America is but a remnant of what has existed there in former   ages, and has been eaten away by the inroads of the sea.    Now whence did all that enormous mass of vegetable soil come?  Off   some neighbouring land, was the first and most natural answer.  It   was a rational one.  It proceeded from the known to the unknown.  It   was clear that these plants had grown on land; for they were land-  plants.  It was clear that there must have been land close by, for   between the beds of coal, as you all know, the rock is principally   coarse sandstone, which could only have been laid down (as I have   explained to you already) in very shallow water.    It was natural, then, to suppose that these plants and trees had been   swept down by rivers into the sea, as the sands and muds which buried   them had been.  And it was known that at the mouths of certain   rivers--the Mississippi, for instance--vast rafts of dead floating   trees accumulated; and that the bottoms of the rivers were often full   of snags, etc.; trees which had grounded, and stuck in the mud; and   why should not the coal have been formed in the same way?    Because--and this was a serious objection--then surely the coal would   be impure--mixed up with mud and sand, till it was not worth burning.    Instead of which, the coal is usually pure vegetable, parted sharply   from the sandstone which lies on it.  The only other explanation was,   that the coal vegetation had grown in the very places where it was   found.  But that seemed too strange to be true, till that great   geologist, Sir W. Logan--who has since done such good work in Canada-  -showed that every bed of coal had a bed of clay under it, and that   that clay always contained fossils called Stigmaria.  Then it came   out that the Stigmaria in the under clay had long filaments attached   to them, while when found in the sandstones or shales, they had lost   their filaments, and seemed more or less rolled--in fact, that the   natural place of the Stigmaria was in the under clay.  Then Mr.   Binney discovered a tree--a Sigillaria, standing upright in the coal-  measures with its roots attached.  Those roots penetrated into the   under clay of the coal; and those roots were Stigmarias.  That seems   to have settled the question.  The Sigillarias, at least, had grown   where they were found, and the clay beneath the coal-beds was the   original soil on which they had grown.  Just so, if you will look at   any peat bog you will find it bottomed by clay, which clay is pierced   everywhere by the roots of the moss forming the peat, or of the   trees, birches, alders, poplars, and willows, which grow in the bog.    So the proof seemed complete, that the coal had been formed out of   vegetation growing where it was buried.  If any further proof for   that theory was needed, it would be found in this fact, most   ingeniously suggested by Mr. Boyd Dawkins.  The resinous spores, or   seeds of the Lepidodendra make up--as said above--a great part of the   bituminous coal.  Now those spores are so light, that if the coal had   been laid down by water, they would have floated on it, and have been   carried away; and therefore the bituminous coal must have been   formed, not under water, but on dry land.    I have dwelt at length on these further arguments, because they seem   to me as pretty a specimen as I can give my readers of that regular   and gradual induction, that common-sense regulated, by which   geological theories are worked out.    But how does this theory explain the perfect purity of the coal?  I   think Sir C. Lyell answers that question fully in p. 383 of his   \"Student's Elements of Geology.\"  He tells us that the dense growths   of reeds and herbage"]]]
