He didn't look none too  easy, even without his shootin' irons. Out he goes into the night, and  we stood around starin' at each other. Everybody was upset, except Sally  and Bard.    \"He says: 'Miss Fortune, this is our dance, I think.'    \"'Excuse me,' says Sally, 'I almost forgot about it.'    \"And they started to dance to the piano, waltzin' around among the  tables; the rest of us lit out for home because we knew that Butch would  be on his way with his gang before we got very far under cover. But hey,  Steve, where you goin'?\"    \"I'm going to get in on that dance,\" called Nash, and was gone at a  racing gallop down the street.          CHAPTER XVI      BLUFF    He found no dance in progress, however, but in the otherwise empty  eating place, which Sally owned and ran with her two capable hands and  the assistance of a cook, sat Sally herself dining at the same table  with the tenderfoot, the flirt, the horse-breaker, the tamer of  gun-fighters.    Nash stood in the shadow of the doorway watching that lean, handsome  face with the suggestion of mockery in the eyes and the trace of  sternness around the thin lips. Not a formidable figure by any means,  but since his experiences of the past few days, Nash was grown extremely  thoughtful.    What he finally thought he caught in this most unusual tenderfoot was a  certain alertness of a more or less hair-trigger variety. Even now as he  sat at ease at the table, one elbow resting lightly upon it, apparently  enwrapped in the converse of Sally Fortune, Nash had a consciousness  that the other might be on his feet and in the most distant part of the  room within a second.    What he noted in the second instant of his observation was that Sally  was not at all loath to waste her time on the stranger. She was eating  with a truly formidable conventionality of manner, and a certain grace  with which she raised the ponderous coffee cup, made of crockery  guaranteed to resist all falls, struck awe through the heart of the  cowpuncher. She was bent on another conquest, beyond all doubt, and that  she would not make it never entered the thoughts of Nash. He set his  face to banish a natural scowl and advanced with a good-natured smile  into the room.    \"Hello!\" he called.    \"It's old Steve!\" sang out Sally, and whirling from her chair, she  advanced almost at a run to meet him, caught him by both hands, and led  him to a table next to that at which she had been sitting.    It was as gracefully done as if she had been welcoming a brother, but  Nash, knowing Sally, understood perfectly that it was only a play to  impress the eye of Bard. Nevertheless he was forced to accept it in good  part.    \"My old pal, Steve Nash,\" said Sally, \"and this is Mr. Anthony Bard.\"    Just the faintest accent fell on the \"Mr.,\" but it made Steve wince. He  rose and shook hands gravely with the tenderfoot.    \"I stopped at Butler's place down the street,\" he said, \"and been  hearin' a pile about a little play you made a while ago. It was about  time for somebody to call old Butch's bluff.\"    \"Bluff?\" cried Sally indignantly.    \"Bluff?\" queried Bard, with a slight raising of the eyebrows.    \"Sure--bluff. Butch wasn't any more dangerous than a cat with trimmed  claws. But I guess you seen that?\"    He settled down easily in his chair just as Sally resumed her place  opposite Bard.    \"Steve,\" she said, with a quiet venom, \"that bluff of his has been as  good as four-of-a-kind with you for a long time. I never seen you make  any play at Butch.\"    He returned amiably: \"Like to sit here and have a nice social chat,  Sally, but I got to be gettin' back to the ranch, and in the meantime,  I'm sure hungry.\"    At the reminder of business a green light came in the fine blue eyes of  Sally. They were her only really fine features, for the nose tilted an  engaging trifle, the mouth was a little too generous, the chin so strong  that it gave, in moments of passivity, an air of sternness to her face.  That sternness was exaggerated as she rose, keeping her glare fixed upon  Nash; a thing impossible for him to bear, so he lowered his eyes and  engaged in rolling a cigarette. She turned back toward Bard.    \"Sorry I got to go--before I finished eating--but business is business.\"    \"And sometimes,\" suggested Bard, \"a bore.\"    It was an excellent opening for a quarrel, but Nash was remembering  religiously a certain thousand dollars, and also a gesture of William  Drew when he seemed to be breaking an imaginary twig. So he merely  lighted his cigarette and seemed to have heard nothing.    \"The whole town,\" he remarked casually, \"seems scared stiff by this  Butch; but of course he ain't comin' back to-night.\"    \"I suppose,\" said the tenderfoot, after a cold pause, \"that he will  not.\"    But the coldness reacted like the most genial warmth upon Nash. He had  chosen a part detestable to him but necessary to his business. He must  be a \"gabber\" for the nonce, a free talker, a chatterer, who would cover  up all pauses.    \"Kind of strange to ride into a dark town like this,\" he began, \"but I  could tell you a story about--\"    \"Oh, Steve,\" called the voice of Sally from the kitchen.    He rose and nodded to Bard.    \"'Scuse me, I'll be back in a minute.\"    \"Thanks,\" answered the other, with a somewhat grim emphasis.    In the kitchen Sally spoke without prelude. \"What deviltry are you up to  now, Steve?\"    \"Me?\" he repeated with eyes widened by innocence. \"What d'you mean,  Sally?\"    \"Don't four-flush me, Steve.\"    \"Is eating in your place deviltry?\"    \"Am I blind?\" she answered hotly. \"Have I got spring-halt, maybe? You're  too polite, Steve; I can always tell when you're on the way to a little  bell of your own making, by the way you get sort of kind and warmed up.  What is it now?\"    \"Kiss me, Sally, and I'll tell you why I came to town.\"    She said with a touch of colour: \"I'll see you--\" and then changing  quickly, she slipped inside his ready arms with a smile and tilted up  her face.    \"Now what is it, Steve?\"    \"This,\" he answered.    \"What d'you mean?\"    \"You know me, Sally. I've worn out the other ways of raising hell, so I  thought I'd start a little by coming to Eldara to kiss you.\"    Her open hand cracked sharply twice on his lean face and she was out of  his arms. He followed, laughing, but she armed herself with a red-hot  frying pan and defied him.    \"You ain't even a good sport, Steve. I'm done with you! Kiss you?\"    He said calmly: \"I see the hell is startin', all right.\"    But she changed at once, and smiled up to him.    \"I can't stay mad at you, Steve. I s'pose it's because of your nerve. I  want you to do something for me.\"    \"What?\"    \"Is that a way to take it! I've asked you a favour, Steve.\"    He said suspiciously: \"It's got something to do with the tenderfoot in  the room out there?\"    It was a palpable hit, for she coloured sharply. Then she took the bull  by the horns.    \"What if it is?\"    \"Sally, d'you mean to say you've fallen for that cheap line of lingo he  passes out?\"    \"Steve, don't try to kid me.\"    \"Why, you know who he is, don't you?\"    \"Sure; Anthony Bard.\"    \"And do you know who Anthony Bard is?\"    \"Well?\" she asked with some anxiety.    \"Well, if you don't know you can find out. That's what the last girl  done.\"    She wavered, and then blinked her eyes as if she were resolved to shut  out the truth.    \"I asked you to do me a favour, Steve.\"    \"And I will. You know that.\"    \"I want you to see that Bard gets safe out of this town.\"    \"Sure. Nothing I'd rather do.\"    She tilted her head a little to one side and regarded him wistfully.    \"Are you double-crossin' me, Steve?\"    \"Why d'you suspect me? Haven't I said I'd do it?\"    \"But you said it too easy.\"    The gentleness died in her face. She said sternly: \"If you do  double-cross me, you'll find I'm about as hard as any man on the range.  Get me?\"    \"Shake.\"    Their hands met. After all, he did not guarantee what would happen to  the tenderfoot after they were clear of the town. But perhaps this was a  distinction a little too fine for the downright mind of the girl. A sea  of troubles besieged the mind of Nash.    And to let that sea subside he wandered back to the eating room and  found the tenderfoot finishing his coffee. The latter kept an eye of  frank suspicion upon him. So the silence held for a brooding moment,  until Bard asked: \"D'you know the way to the ranch of William Drew?\"    It was a puzzler to Nash. Was not that his job, to go out and bring the  man to Drew's place? Here he was already on the way. He remembered just  in time that the manner of bringing was decidedly qualified.    He said aloud: \"The way? Sure; I work on Drew's place.\"    \"Really!\"    \"Yep; foreman.\"    \"You don't happen to be going back that way to-night?\"    \"Not all the way; part of it.\"    \"Mind if I went along?\"    \"Nobody to keep you from it,\" said the cowpuncher without enthusiasm.    \"By the way, what sort of a man is Drew?\"    \"Don't you know him?\"    \"No. The reason I want to see him is because I want to get the right to  do some--er--fishing and hunting on a place of his on the other side of  the range.\"    \"The place with the old house on it; the place Logan is?\"    \"Exactly. Also I wish to see Logan again. I've got several little things  I'd like to have him explain.\"    \"H-m!\" grunted Nash without apparent interest.    \"And Drew?\"    \"He's a big feller; big and grey.\"    \"Ah-h-h,\" said the other, and drew in his breath, as though he were  drinking.    It seemed to Nash that he had never seen such an unpleasant smile.    \"You'll get what you want out of Drew. He's generous.\"    \"I hope so,\" nodded the other, with far-off eyes. \"I've got a lot to ask  of him.\"          CHAPTER XVII      BUTCH RETURNS    He reminded Nash of some big puma cub warming itself at a hearth "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11102"],[0,"History of Negro Soldiers in the Spanish-American War, and Other Items of (#16)"],[1,"of La Tribuna and in 1890 returned to Havana and resumed  the publication of La Fraternidad.    ANOTHER EXILE.    Another beloved exile from the land of his birth is Senor Jose White.  His mother was a colored woman of Matanzas. At the age of 16 Jose  wrote a mass for the Matanzas orchestra and gave his first concert.  With the proceeds he entered the Conservatory of Paris, and in the  following year won the first prize as violinist among thirty-nine  contestants. He soon gained an enviable reputation among the most  celebrated European violinists, and, covered with honors, returned to  Havana in January of '75. But his songs were sometimes of liberty, and  in June of the same year the Spanish government drove him out of  the country. Then he went to Brazil, and is now President of the  Conservatory of Music of Rio Janeiro.    One might go on multiplying similar incidents. Some of the most  eminent doctors, lawyers and college professors in Cuba are more or  less darkly \"colored.\" In the humble walks of life one finds them  everywhere, as carpenters, masons, shoemakers and plumbers. In the few  manufacturies of Cuba a large proportion of the workmen are Negroes  especially in the cigar factories. In the tanneries of Pinar del Rio  most of the workmen are colored, also in the saddle factories of  Havana, Guanabacoa, Cardenas and other places. Although the insurgent  army is not yet disbanded, the sugar-planters get plenty of help from  their ranks by offering fair wages.--New York Sun.    FACTS ABOUT PORTO RICO TOLD IN SHORT PARAGRAPHS.    Porto Rico, the beautiful island which General Miles is taking under  the American flag, has an area of 3,530 square miles. It is 107 miles  in length and 37 miles across. It has a good telegraph line and a  railroad only partially completed.    The population, which is not made up of so many Negroes and mulattoes  as that of the neighboring islands, is about 900,000. Almost all of  the inhabitants are Roman Catholics.    It is a mountainous island, and contains forty seven navigable streams.  The roads are merely paths beaten down by cattle.    Exports in 1887 were valued at $10,181,291; imports, $10,198,006.    Gold, copper, salt, coal and iron abound.    The poorer classes live almost entirely on a variety of highland rice,  which is easily cultivated, as it requires no flooding.    One of the principal industries is grazing. St. Thomas is the market  for fresh meat.    Corn, tobacco, sugar, coffee, cotton and potatoes constitute the  principal crops.    There are no snakes, no beasts of prey, no noxious birds nor insects  in the island.    The trees and grass are always green.    Rats are the great foe of the crops.    The natives often live to be one hundred years old.    The most beautiful flower on the island is the ortegon, which has  purple blossoms a yard long.    Hurricanes are frequent on the north coast and very destructive.    Mosquitoes art the pest of the island.    Spanish is the language spoken, and education is but little esteemed.    Every man, no matter how poor, owns a horse and three or four  gamecocks.    The small planter is called \"Xivaro.\" He is the proud possessor of  a sweet-heart, a gamecock, a horse, a hammock, a guitar and a large  supply of tobacco. He is quick tempered but not revengeful, and he is  proverbially lazy.    Hospitality is the rule of the island. The peasants are astonished and  hurt when offered money by travellers. San Juan Harbor is one of the  best in the West Indies, and is said to be the third most strongly  fortified town in the world, Halifax being the strongest and  Cartagena, Spain, the second.    Ponce de Leon, between 1509 and 1518 killed off the natives.    The De Leon palace, built in 1511, is of great interest to tourists.    The climate is warm but pleasant. At night thick clothing is found  comfortable.    All visiting and shopping are done after sundown.    Slavery was abolished in 1873.    The women are rather small and delicately formed. Many of them are  pretty and they are all given to flirtation.    Men and women ride horseback alike. Wicker baskets to carry clothes or  provisions, are hung on either side of the horse's shoulders. Back of  these baskets the rider sits.    It is the custom of travellers on horseback to carry a basket handled  sword a yard and a quarter long, more as an ornament than as a means  of defense.    The observance of birthdays is an island fashion that is followed by  every one.    A Governor, appointed by the Crown, manages affairs. His palace is at  San Juan, the capital, a town that has 24,000 inhabitants.    Upon the Rio Grande are prehistoric monuments that have attracted the  attention of archaeologists.    Following the Spanish custom, men are imprisoned for debt.    In the towns houses are built with flat roofs, both to catch water and  to afford the family a small roof garden.    All planters have town houses where they bring their families during  the carnival season.    San Juan is filled with adventurers, gamblers, speculators and  fugitives from justice.--New York World.          CHAPTER VII.      LIST OF COLORED REGIMENTS THAT DID ACTIVE SERVICE IN THE  SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR,--AND VOLUNTEER REGIMENTS.      Regulars.--Section 1104 of the Revised Statutes of the United States  Congress provides that \"the enlisted men of two regiments of Cavalry  shall be colored men,\" and in compliance with this section the War  Department maintains the organization of the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry,  both composed of colored men with white officers.    Section 1108 of the Revised Statutes of Congress provides that \"the  enlisted men of two regiments of Infantry shall be colored men;\" and  in compliance with this section the War Department maintains the  organization of the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Infantry, both  composed of colored men with white officers.    The above regiments were the only colored troops that were engaged  in active service in Cuba. There is no statute requiring colored  artillery regiments to be organized, and there are therefore none in  the regular army.           *       *       *       *       *    A LIST OF THE VOLUNTEER REGIMENTS.    Third North Carolina--All colored officers.    Sixth Virginia--White officers, finally, the colored officers resigned  \"under pressure,\" after which there was much trouble with the men, as  they claimed to have enlisted with the understanding that they were to  have colored officers.    [Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE NINTH OHIO--LIEUTENANT YOUNG IN THE  CENTER.]    Blank Page    Ninth Ohio--All colored officers; Col. Chas. Young, graduate of West  Point.    Twenty-third Kansas--Colored officers.    Eighth Illinois--Under colored officers, and did police duty at San  Luis, Cuba.    Seventh U.S. Volunteers.    Tenth U.S. Volunteers.    Eighth U.S. Volunteers.    Ninth U.S. Volunteers.    The conduct of the colored volunteers has been harshly criticised, and  it is thought by some that the conduct of the volunteers has had some  influence in derrogation of the good record made by the regulars  around Santiago. This view, however, we think unjust, and ill-founded.  There was considerable shooting of pistols and drunkenness among some  regiments of volunteers, and it was not confined by any means to those  of the colored race. The white volunteers were as drunk and noisy as  the colored, and shot as many pistols.    The Charlotte Observer has the following editorial concerning some  white troops that passed through Charlotte, N.C.:    \"Mustered-out West Virginia and New York volunteer soldiers who passed  through this city Saturday night, behaved on the train and here like  barbarians, disgracing their uniforms, their States and themselves.  They were drunk and disorderly, and their firing of pistols,  destruction of property and theft of edibles was not as bad as their  outrageous profanity and obscenity on the cars in the hearing of  ladies. Clearly they are brutes when sober and whiskey only developed  the vileness already in them.\"    By a careful comparison of the reports in the newspapers, we see a  slight excess of rowdyism on the part of the whites, but much less  fuss made about it. In traveling from place to place if a white  volunteer company fired a few shots in the air, robbed a fruit stand,  or fussed with the by standers at railroad stations or drank whiskey  at the car windows, the fact was simply mentioned in the morning  papers, but if a Negro company fired a pistol a telegram was sent  ahead to have mobs in readiness to \"do up the niggers\" at the next  station, and at one place in Georgia the militia was called out by a  telegram sent ahead, and discharged a volley into the car containing  white officers and their families, so eager were they to \"do up the  nigger.\" At Nashville the city police are reported to have charged  through the train clubbing the colored volunteers who were returning  home, and taking anything in the shape of a weapon away from them by  force. In Texarcana or thereabouts it was reported that a train of  colored troopers was blown up by dynamite. The Southern mobs seemed to  pride themselves in assaulting the colored soldiers.      While the colored volunteers were not engaged in active warfare, yet  they attained a high degree of discipline and the CLEANEST AND MOST  ORDERLY CAMP among any of the volunteers was reported by the chief  sanitary officer of the government to be that of one of the colored  volunteer regiments stationed in Virginia. It is to be regretted that  the colored volunteers, especially those under Negro officers, did not  have an opportunity to show their powers on the battlefield, and thus  demonstrate their ability as soldiers, and so refreshing the memory  of the nation as to what Negro soldiers once did at Ft. Wagner and  Milikin's Bend. The volunteer boys were ready and willing and only  needed a chance to show what they could do.    POLICED BY NEGROES."]]]
