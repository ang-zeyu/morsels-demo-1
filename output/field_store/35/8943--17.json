But the congregation have got used to the  window, and will neither break it nor permit others to do so. Six  spaces for tablet inscriptions occupy the base of the window. Two of  them are blank; two have a great mass of letters packed into them;  and two are but moderately filled in with words. At a distance  nobody can see what is said upon them. It is reported that they  contain the Decalogue and the Apostles' Creed; and if this be so,  the incumbent, the curate, and the clerk must have been the parties  for whose delight they were put up, for they are the nearest to, and  can consequently best read, them. There are the full compliment of  sacred enclosures and resting places at the higher end of the  church--a chair for the ease of the incumbent or curate; a desk for  the prayer reader; a box for the clerk; a lectern for the lesson  reader; and a stout pulpit for the preacher.    The congregation of St. Peter's Church, as we have said, is small.  We cannot tell whether the collections terrify folk; probably they  do; for it is estimated that there are between 30 and 40 of them  annually, and sometimes they come in an unbroken line for several  Sundays together. A plan like this is enough to make people shy in  their attendance,--is certain to make ordinarily generous beings  cover what they give with their finger ends, or slip their gifts  sharply into the boxes and get them instantly mixed up with the  rest, so that nobody can tell whether they have contributed a simple  copper, a roguish little threepenny piece, or a respectable looking  shilling. There are voluntary contribution boxes at the doors, but  they never get very heavy. Those attending the church are mainly  working people. With the exception of about five, all have to fight  briskly for a living. A greater work has been done outside than  within the church. There are many schools and classes belonging, the  place. In Cold Bath-street there is a large school for girls and  infants, and it is very well attended. In Fylde-road there is a club  for working men, open every day; and on Sundays several of the  \"wives and mothers of Britain\" attend a class in the same building.  In Brook-street there is a regular day school. On Sunday afternoons  the members of an adult male class meet in it. The average  attendance of these members is about 160, and their ages range from  20 to 70. The district has been well worked up; and there are many  of both sexes in it prepared to either pray or fight for St.  Peter's.    The music at the church is good. It costs about 30 pounds a year,  and a rather strong effort is sometimes required to raise that sum.  The organist immediately preceding the present one used to play for  nothing; get one or two collections annually for the choir; and make  up out of his own pocket any financial deficiency there might be.  The gentleman who now operates upon the organ, likewise gives his  services gratuitously; he also has collections for the choir; but if  those said collections come short of the sum required, he is  seriously impressed with the idea that the deficiency ought to come  out of other people's purses, and not his. And so it does. The  organist has considerable musical ability; he plays the instrument  in his care with precision; but he throws too much force into its  effusions--believes too much in high pressure--and the general  boiler of its melody may burst some day, kill the blower instantly,  and dash the choir into space. The internal service arrangements at  St. Peter's are worked by an incumbent, a curate, and a clerk. The  last named gentleman has been a long time at his post; he is a dry,  orthodox, careful man; never mistook a three-penny for a fourpenny  piece in his life; doesn't like slippery sixpences; and he gets for  his general services at the church 15 pounds a year. Nobody hardly  ever hears him; the responses of the choir materially swamp the  music of his voice; but his lips move, and that is at least a sign  of life.    The incumbent is the Rev. D. F. Chapman. He has been at the place a  few years, and receives about 400 pounds a-year for his trouble. Mr.  Chapman is a powerfully-constructed gentleman; is somewhat inclined  to oleaginousness; has contracted a marine swing in his walk; is  heavily clerical in countenance and cloth; believes in keeping his  hair broad at the sides; has a strong will and an enormous opinion  of the incumbent of St. Peter's; will fume if crossed; will crush if  touched; can't be convinced; has his mind made up and rivetted down  on everything; must have his way; thinks every antagonist mistaken;  is washy, windy, ponderous; has a clear notion that each of his  postulates is worth a couple of demonstrations, that all his  theories are tantamount to axioms; and, finally, has quarelled more  with his churchwardens than any other live parson in Preston. He  once fought for weeks, day and night, with a warden as to the  position of a small gas-pipe, because he couldn't get his way about  it. He is well educated, but his erudition is not fairly utilised;  he can read with moderate precision; but there is a lack of  elocutionary finish in his tone; he can talk a long while, and now  and then can say a good thing; he preaches with considerable force,  makes good use of his arms, sometimes rants a little, at intervals  has to pull back his sentences half an inch to get hold of the right  word, talks straight out occasionally, telling the congregation what  they are doing and what they ought to do; but there is much in his  sermons which neither gods nor men will care about digesting, and  there is a theological dogmatism in them which ordinary sinners like  ourselves will never swallow. We are rather inclined to admire the  gentleman who, until lately, officiated as his curate--the Rev. E.  Lee,--and who, after preaching his last sermon, was next day made  the recipient of that most fashionable and threadbare of all things,  a presentation. Originally he indulged in odd pranks, said strange  things, was laughably eccentric, and did for a period appear to be,  in an ecclesiastical sense, what the kangaroo of Artemus Ward was in  a zoological one--\"the most amoozin little cuss ever introduced to a  discriminatin public.\" He has still some of the \"amoozin\" traits  about him; but during his curacy in St. Peters district he showed  that he could work hard, visit often, look after the poor, be  generous, get up good classes, and never tire of his duty. His  salary was about 120 pounds a year, and he was benevolent with it.  He has a stronger pair of lungs than any parson in Preston, and he  can use them longer than most men without feeling tired. His sermons  are of a practical type; he believes largely in telling people what  he thinks; and never hesitates to hit rich and poor alike in his  discourses. He has been transplanted to the Parish Church, and he  will stir up a few of the respectable otiose souls there if he has  an opportunity. There is a good deal of swagger about him; he  believes in carry a stick and turning it; in admiring himself and  letting other people know that he is of a cypher; there is much  conceit and ever so much bombast about him; he likes giving  historical lectures; thinks he is an authority on everything  appertaining to Elizabeth, Mary, the Prince of Orange, &c.; is fond  of attacking Bishop Goss, and getting into a groove of garrulous  declamation concerning Papists; still he is a determined worker, has  been a laborious curate, has troubled himself more than many people  in looking after those whom parsons are so fond of calling sinners  and so indifferent about visiting. He was well liked in St. Peter's  district, and we hope that in the new one he has gone to he will  gather friends, increase his usefulness, get married, and give fewer  polemical lectures.        NEW JERUSALEM CHURCH.        De gustibus non est applies with as much force to religious as to  secular life. People's tastes will differ; you can no more account  for them in church-naming than in kissing or child-christening; and  that being so, let no pious piece of perfection dispute with the New  Jerusalem brethren as to their spiritual gustation. If a man were  virtuously inclined to pirate in his religious nomenclature the  oddities of old Carey, who coined that finely flowing word  \"aldeborontiphoscophornio,\" which is only a line ahead of that other  stately polysyllable \"chrononhotonthologos,\" why let him do so, for  somebody with more madness or wisdom than yourself will some day end  or mend him. Let every man have his \"cogibundity of cogitation,\" and  let people suit themselves about the names of their churches.  Swedenborgians is the name commonly given to those who belong to  \"the New Church signified by the New Jerusalem in the Revelation.\"  They might have cut it shorter to be sure; and they might have had a  less mystical but certainly not a cleverer man for their founder  than the Swedish Emanuel. No modern ever knew half so much, or knew  it so oddly, as Swedenborg; and no one ever wrote so immensely on  questions so varied and intractable. He knew something about  everything, from toe nails to the differential and integral  calculus, from iron smelting to star cycles, and in reading his  works you might almost fancy, so familiar does he appear to be with  spirits, that he had a quotidian nod from Michael and a daily \"How  are you, old boy?\" from Gabriel. Emerson does well when he puts him  down as the representative man of mystery; and when he calls him the  mastodon and missourian of literature, he will have the concurrence  of all unbiased scholars.    There are about 70 persons in Preston who care vitally for that  ideal Church which St. John saw in Patmos--if New Jerusalemism, as  delineated by the followers of Swedenborg, is its symbol. Only about  70 are connected as \"members\" with its physical temple in Avenham-  road."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10484"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 03: Ancient Achievements (#16)"],[1,"of Egyptian mummies are covered with  painted and hieroglyphic presentations of religious subjects; but the  colors were laid without regard to light and shade. The Egyptians did  not seek to represent the passions and emotions which agitate the soul,  but rather to authenticate events and actions; and hence their  paintings, like hieroglyphics, are but inscriptions. It was their great  festivals and religious rites which they sought to perpetuate, not ideas  of beauty or of grace. Thus their paintings abound with dismembered  animals, plants, and flowers, with censers, entrails,--whatever was used  in their religious worship. In Greece also the original painting  consisted in coloring statues and reliefs of wood and clay. At Corinth,  painting was early united with the fabrication of vases, on which were  rudely painted figures of men and animals. Among the Etruscans, before  Rome was founded, it is said there were beautiful paintings, and it is  probable that these people were advanced in art before the Greeks. There  were paintings in some of the old Etruscan cities which the Roman  emperors wished to remove, so much admired were they even in the days of  the greatest splendor. The ancient Etruscan vases are famous for designs  which have never been exceeded in purity of form, but it is probable  that these were copied from the Greeks.    Whether the Greeks or the Etruscans were the first to paint, however,  the art was certainly carried to the greatest perfection among the  former. The development of it was, like all arts, very gradual. It  probably began by drawing the outline of a shadow, without intermediate  markings; the next step was the complete outline with the inner  markings,--such as are represented on the ancient vases, or like the  designs of Flaxman. They were originally practised on a white ground;  then light and shade were introduced, and then the application of colors  in accordance with Nature. We read of a great painting by Bularchus, of  the battle of Magnete, purchased by a king of Lydia seven hundred and  eighteen years before Christ. As the subject was a battle, it must have  represented the movement of figures, although we know nothing of the  coloring or of the real excellence of the work, except that the artist  was paid munificently. Cimon of Cleona is the first great name connected  with the art in Greece. He is praised by Pliny, to whom we owe the  history of ancient painting more than to any other author. Cimon was not  satisfied with drawing simply the outlines of his figures, such as we  see in the oldest painted vases, but he also represented limbs, and  folds of garments. He invented the art of foreshortening, or the various  representations of the diminution of the length of figures as they  appear when looked at obliquely; and hence was the first painter of  perspective. He first made muscular articulations, indicated the veins,  and gave natural folds to drapery.    A much greater painter than he was Polygnotus of Thasos, the  contemporary of Phidias, who came to Athens about the year 463  B.C.,--one of the greatest geniuses of any age, and one of the most  magnanimous, who had the good fortune to live in an age of exceeding  intellectual activity. He painted on panels, which were afterward let  into the walls, being employed on the public buildings of Athens, and on  the great temple of Delphi, the hall of which he painted gratuitously.  He also decorated the Propylaea, which was erected under the  superintendence of Phidias. The pictures of Polygnotus had nothing of  that elaborate grouping, aided by the powers of perspective, so much  admired in modern art. His greatness lay in statuesque painting, which  he brought nearly to perfection by ideal expression, accurate drawing,  and improved coloring. He used but few colors, and softened the rigidity  of his predecessors by making the mouth of beauty smile. He gave great  expression to the face and figure, and his pictures were models of  excellence for the beauty of the eyebrows, the blush upon the cheeks,  and the gracefulness of the draperies. He strove, like Phidias, to  express character in repose. He imitated the personages and the subjects  of the old mythology, and treated them in an epic spirit, his subjects  being almost invariably taken from Homer and the Epic cycle.    Among the works of Polygnotus, as mentioned by Pliny, are his paintings  in the Temple at Delphi, in the Propylaea of the Acropolis, in the  Temple of Theseus, and in the Temple of the Dioscuri at Athens. He  painted in a truly religious spirit, and upon symmetrical principles,  with great grandeur and freedom, resembling Michael Angelo more than any  other modern artist.    The use of oil was unknown to the ancients. The artists painted upon  wood, clay, plaster, stone, parchment, but not upon canvas, which was  not used till the time of Nero. They painted upon tablets or panels, and  not upon the walls,--the panels being afterward framed and encased in  the walls. The stylus, or cestrum, used in drawing and for spreading the  wax colors was pointed on one end and flat on the other, and generally  made of metal. Wax was prepared by purifying and bleaching, and then  mixed with colors. When painting was practised in watercolors, glue was  used with the white of an egg or with gums; but wax and resins were also  worked with water, with certain preparations. This latter mode was  called encaustic, and was, according to Plutarch, the most durable of  all methods. It was not generally adopted till the time of Alexander the  Great. Wax was a most essential ingredient, since it prevented the  colors from cracking. Encaustic painting was practised both with the  cestrum and the pencil, and the colors were also burned in.    Fresco, or water-color, on fresh plaster, was used for coloring walls,  which were divided into compartments or panels. The composition of the  stucco, and the method of preparing the walls for painting, is described  by the ancient writers: \"They first covered the walls with a layer of  ordinary plaster, over which, when dry, were successively added three  other layers of a finer quality, mixed with sand. Above these were  placed three layers of a composition of chalk and marble-dust, the upper  one being laid on before the under one was dry; by which process the  different layers were so bound together that the whole mass formed one  beautiful and solid slab, resembling marble, and was capable of being  detached from the wall and transported in a wooden frame to any  distance. The colors were applied when the composition was still wet.  The fresco wall, when painted, was covered with an encaustic varnish,  both to heighten the color and to preserve it from the effects of the  sun or the weather; but this process required so much care, and was  attended with so much expense, that it was used only in the better  houses and palaces.\" The later discoveries at Pompeii show the same  correctness of design in painting as in sculpture, and also considerable  perfection in coloring. The great artists of Greece--Phidias and  Euphranor, Zeuxis and Protogenes, Polygnotus and Lysippus--were both  sculptors and painters, like Michael Angelo; and the ancient writers  praise the paintings of these great artists as much as their sculpture.  The Aldobrandini Marriage, found on the Esquiline Mount during the  pontificate of Clement VIII., and placed in the Vatican by Pius VII., is  admired both for drawing and color. Polygnotus was praised by Aristotle  for his designs, and by Lucian for his color.    Dionysius and Mikon were the great contemporaries of Polygnotus, the  former being celebrated for his portraits. His pictures were deficient  in the ideal, but were remarkable for expression and elegant drawing.  Mikon was particularly skilled in painting horses, and was the first who  used for a color the light Attic ochre, and the black made from burnt  vine-twigs. He painted three of the walls of the Temple of Theseus, and  also the walls of the Temple of the Dioscuri.    A greater painter still was Apollodorus of Athens. Through his labors,  about 408 B.C., dramatic effect was added to the style of Polygnotus,  without departing from his pictures as models. \"The acuteness of his  taste,\" says Fuseli, \"led him to discover that as all men were connected  by one general form, so they were separated each by some predominant  power, which fixed character and bound them to a class. Thence he drew  his line of imitation, and personified the central form of the class to  which his object belonged, and to which the rest of its qualities  administered without being absorbed. Agility was not suffered to destroy  firmness, solidity, or weight; nor strength and weight, agility.  Elegance did not degenerate into effeminacy, nor grandeur swell to  hugeness.\" His aim was to deceive the eye of the spectator by the  semblance of reality: he painted men and things as they really appeared.  He also made a great advance in coloring: he invented chiaro-oscuro.  Other painters had given attention to the proper gradation of light and  shade; he heightened this effect by the gradation of tints, and thus  obtained what the moderns call _tone_. He was the first who conferred  due honor on the pencil,--_primusque gloriam penicillo jure contulit_.    This great painter was succeeded by Zeuxis, who belonged to his school,  but who surpassed him in the power to give ideal form to rich effects.  He began his great career four hundred and twenty-four years before  Christ, and was most remarkable for his female figures. His Helen,  painted from five of the most beautiful women of Croton, was one of the  most renowned productions of antiquity, to see which the painter  demanded money. He gave away his pictures, because, with an artist's  pride, he maintained that their price could not be estimated. There is  a tradition that Zeuxis laughed himself to death over an old"]]]
