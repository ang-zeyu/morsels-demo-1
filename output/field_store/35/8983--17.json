The valve is provided  with an internal collar as shown, so that it has to rise for the width of  this before the steam is let out, and thus determines the swing of the  clapper and the force of the blow. To intensify the latter and multiply  the number of blows, the clapper spring is prolonged over the fulcrum and  bent back so as to form a spring, which is tightened by the lifting of the  flap, and sends the clapper down on the bell with increased force. The  hinge of the flap does not require any lubrication besides what it gets  through the steam. The bell is fixed upon the roof of the driver's cab, so  that the steam does not interfere with his lookout, and fastened by three  bolts or screws. The diameter of the steam-pipe is from 1/4 to 1/2 inch  according to the size of the bell, and the distance of the clapper from  the bell is a little less than the diameter of the corresponding cock. The  steam cock is perforated as shown by the illustration to drain the pipe  when shut, and a small hole, b, in the bell cylinder drains the latter.  The steam-pipe is made with a bend as usual, to allow for contraction and  expansion. The number of blows given varies according to the steam  pressure, and the opening of the steam cock; it is    With  90 lb. pressure, and cock 1/2 open, 170 blows per min.        \"  \"      \"          \"    1/3   \"   136        \"       105 \"      \"          \"    1/2   \"   240        \"        \"  \"      \"          \"    1/3   \"   156        \"        \"  \"      \"          \"    1/5   \"   136        \"       120 \"      \"          \"    1/3   \"   228        \"       135 \"      \"          \"    1/5   \"   200        \"    To start the bell, the cock is opened full, and afterward partly closed.  The blows follow in such rapid succession that a kind of uniform sound  with louder intervals is produced, but not of the same shrill character as  by a steam whistle. The same kind of bell is used on the shunting engines  in goods yards, where roadways have to be crossed on which lurries and  handtrucks circulate, and the results as far as prevention of accidents is  concerned are stated to be very satisfactory.           *       *       *       *       *          LIEUT. GREELY BEFORE THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.      Lieuts. Greely and Ray were received with distinguished honors at the  meeting of the British Association in Montreal. A complimentary luncheon  was tendered him by the members of the British Association for the  Advancement of Science, at the Windsor Hotel. General Sir Henry Lefroy  presided. In response to the toast \"Our Distinguished Guests,\" coupling  the names of Lieuts. Greely and Ray and Mrs. Greely, Lieut. Greely said:    \"_Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen_: I need scarcely say that this  flattering reception from representative men of one of England's most  distinguished societies touches deeply my feelings as a soldier and as a  man. It is not alone that you represent the science and learning of  England and the world, but that you are all countrymen of those daring  seamen and explorers whose names and whose deeds have become household  words throughout the world. Hudson, Baffin, Cook, Nelson, Parry, Franklin,  and a score of others among the dead; McClintock, Nares, and Markham, and  last, but not least, the man whose name was oftenest on our lips when  praying for relief during the past terrible winter--Bedford Pim. What  those men have done the whole world knows. That you should deem aught that  I have done worthy to placed with the deeds of those illustrious men must  always be a source of pride to me. For three centuries England maintained  against the world the honors of the farthest north. Step by step every  advance was made by Englishmen. Now England's grandest colony presses to  the front; but none the less is the honor England's, for at the price of  her sons' lives and by their toil the path was cleared. But for Beaumont's  dauntless pluck and indomitable energy in 1876, Lockwood would never had  made his great northing in 1882. I have during a quarter of a century's  service, as becomes a soldier, been jealous of my honor. I have striven to  maintain it in the field, fighting and bleeding for my country, and at my  desk studying and discussing scientific data; in the Arctic Circle, when  pursuing scientific and geographical work, or later, when stranded by  adverse fate, and starving and freezing upon the barren coast. This marked  and public testimonial of your approval cannot fail to make me doubly  jealous of it in days to come.\"    Lieut. Ray followed, returning thanks in his own behalf.    After other speeches Sir Henry Lefroy presented Lieutenant Greely with the  following informal address:       \"Montreal, Sept. 2, 1884.       \"The undersigned, on behalf of many warm friends and admirers, and     as representing various professional and scientific pursuits,     desire to express to you their appreciation of the courage and     devotion which has characterized your conduct during the trying     circumstances of your late Arctic service. We trust that your     health may soon be restored, and that you may long be spared to     tender, as during your past distinguished career, those valuable     and distinguished services to your great country which have already     placed you among the foremost of scientific explorers of the age.       \"Yours faithfully, Rayleigh, President.\"    In introducing Lieut. Greely, Sir Henry Lefroy, referring to the  persistence of purpose shown by his party in bringing back the pendulum  apparatus, remarked that there was nothing nobler in the annals of  scientific heroism than the determination of these hungry men to drag the  cumbersome box along their weary way.    It was fully two minutes after rising before Lieut. Greely could speak, so  great was the outburst of enthusiasm which greeted him. He remarked that  he was surprised to learn that the ground did not thaw lower at Lieut.  Ray's station, which was ten degrees farther south than his own, where the  ground thawed to a much greater depth--namely, twenty to thirty feet. In  regard to an open polar sea, he differed from Lieut. Ray. He did not  believe there was a navigable sea at the pole, but he was of the opinion  that there was open water somewhere about.    The geographical work of the Lady Franklin Bay expedition covers nearly  three degrees of latitude and over forty degrees of longitude. Starting  from latitude 81 deg. 44 min. and longitude 84 deg. 45 min., Lieut.  Lockwood reached, May 18, 1882, on the north coast of Greenland, latitude  83 deg. 24 min. and longitude 40 deg. 46 min. From the same starting point  he reached to the southwest, in May, 1883, Greely Fiord, an inlet of the  Western Polar Ocean, latitude 80 deg. 48 min. and longitude 78 deg. 26  min. This journey to the northward resulted in the addition to our charts  of a new coast line of nearly 100 miles beyond the farthest point seen by  Lieut. Beaumont, R.N. It also carried Greenland over 400 miles northward,  giving that continent a much greater extension in that direction than it  had generally been credited with.    In a subsequent speech he took occasion to say that a fact had surprised  him. It was the discovery that when the tide was flowing from the North  Pole it was found by his observations that the water was warmer than when  flowing in the opposite direction. He took the trouble to have prepared an  elaborate set of observations showing this wonderful phenomenon, which  would eventually be published. To him these pecularities were  unexplainable, and be hoped that the observations would be studied by his  hearers, and some explanation found in regard to the thermometric  observations of the expedition. He remarked that the mean temperature for  the year of the hourly observations was 5 degrees below zero, which  justified him in saying his station was the coldest point of earth ever  reached.           *       *       *       *       *          DIAMOND MINING IN BRAZIL.      It was in 1729 that the Portuguese government learned of the discovery of  the diamond that had been made in the rivers of the environs of Diamantina  by some adventurers who had entered this region in search of gold. Since  that epoch the exploitation of this gem, pursued under varied regimes, and  with diverse success, has never ceased. As soon as it heard of this  discovery, the Portuguese government thought it would make as much profit  out of it as possible, so it no longer authorized any other exploitation  in the Diamantina regions than that of the diamond, and it imposed upon  such exploitation a tax that was fixed at 28 francs per laborer in 1729  and 224 in 1734. From 1734 to 1739 all operations were suspended, and a  more lucrative organization for the treasury was sought for. In 1739 the  era of contracts was inaugurated. The exploitation of the diamond was  farmed out for four years to a _contratador_, who was to work a certain  territory with a number of men, fixed at 600 as a maximum, and to pay into  the treasury a sum per workman (whether working or not) that varied from  1,288 francs per year in 1734 to 1,344 francs for the last contract, that  ended in 1772. At this epoch the government took the exploitation of the  diamond in hand, and gave it in charge of a special administration, which  was submitted to the direction of the treasury of Lisbon, and which had at  its head a comptroller. This new regime lasted till 1845. In order to  render the surveillance of the treasury agents efficient, and prevent  smuggling (which can be so easily done with an object like the diamond),  it was necessary to impose a special regime over the entire region of  Diamantina, and, in fact, the latter was, up to the independence of  Brazil, submitted to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11649"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 799, April 25, 1891 (#16)"],[1,"blocks are handled with an  ornamental effect in the piers, lintels, and arches, and well set off by  a simple high-pitched slate roof, with terra-cotta hiprolls, crestings,  and finials. The open porches are both ornamental and useful, taking the  place of piazzas. The tower is embellished with a terra-cotta frieze.  All accommodations for an executive staff for the 1,500 patients may be  provided in this building.    Behind it on the south is a one story building whose ground plan is the  segment of a circle. It contains sun rooms, medical offices, general  library, laboratory and dispensary, and the corridor connecting the  reception cottages, one for women, on one side, and one for men on the  other, with the administration building. As this one story structure is  171 feet by 41, the buildings known as cottages of the central group are  more than nominally separated. All the advantages of segregation and  congregation are combined.    The reception cottages are of pale red Potsdam sandstone. Their simple  construction is pleasing. The ground plan is in the form of a cross; the  angles of the projections being flanked by heavy piers between which are  recessed circular bays carried up to the attic and arched over in the  gables. The cross plan affords abundant light to all the rooms, and as  much of the irregular outline as possible is utilized with piazzas. With  still another recourse to the combination corridor plan, the observation  cottages are joined to the reception cottages on each side. The other  utilization of the corridor in this case is for conservatories. The  observation cottages are irregular in plan and vary from each other and  from the other buildings in the group. Unwrought native bluestone is the  building material. These cottages contain a preponderance of single  rooms, the purpose being to keep patients separate until their  classification is decided upon.    The buildings planned but not yet constructed of the central group  include two cottages for convalescents and two one-story retreats for  noisy and disturbed patients. In both cases the plans are the most  complete and progressive ever made. In the first the degree of  construction is reduced to the minimum. Convalescents are to have  freedom from the irritations of hospital life that often retard  recovery. Great reliance is placed upon that important element in  treatment, the rousing of a hopeful feeling in the mind of the patient.    The retreat wards, with accommodations in each wing for eighteen  patients, show in this particular how little the old method of strict  confinement is to be employed in the new institution. That proportion of  the total insane population of 1,500 is regarded as all that it is  necessary to sequester to prevent the disturbance of the rest. Hollow  walls, sleeping room windows opening into small areas, and corridor  space between the several divisions are features which make the per  capita cost of the construction comparatively large for these two  cottages, but which, it is believed, will prove to be wise ones.    All of these buildings are as complete from a hospital standpoint as can  possibly be devised. Outer walls wind and moisture proof, and inner  walls of brick, with an absolutely protected air space between, insure  strength and warmth. An interior wall finish of the hardest and most  non-absorbent materials known for such uses is a valuable hygienic  provision, and both safety and salubrity are further conserved by an  absence of any hollow spaces between floors and ceilings, or in stud  partitions. No vermin retreats, no harbors for rodents, no channels for  flame exist. Heating is accomplished by indirect radiation with the  steam supply from the power house, but there are many open fireplaces to  add to the complete stack and flue system of ventilation.    Attached to the central group and completed are the kitchen building,  the laundry building and a dwelling house for employes, which are so  disposed in the rear of the group as to make a courtyard of value for  the resort of patients, as the main buildings protect and shelter it.  These buildings are ample for their work when the institution's full  capacity is attained. The kitchen building is a particularly interesting  one. All of the cooking is to be done there, and a system of subways,  with tracks on which food cars are run, connects it with all of the  groups. An idea of the magnitude of kitchen plans for such an  institution may be got from one single fact. The pantry is a lofty room,  20x32 feet.    The calculation that 80 per cent. of the insane of the district would be  in the chronic stages of the disease explains the provision in detached  cottage groups for this proportion of the patients. A great proportion  of these are feeble and helpless, requiring constant attendance night  and day, but attendance that can be given cheaply and efficiently in  associate day rooms, dining rooms and large dormitories. Detached group  No. 1, which is completed, is an infirmary group for patients of both  sexes of this class. It is chiefly one story in height, and the plan  permits an abundance of sunlight and air for every room.    Detached group No. 2 is intended for 185 men of the chronic insane  class, who require more than ordinary care and observation. Detached  group No. 3 is composed of two-story buildings for 322 women. It has  several large work-shops. Occupation is one of the main reliances of the  planners of the institution as a part of the treatment there.    Detached group No. 4 is designed for both men and women, and will  accommodate 150. A wholly different classification is here provided for,  the actively industrious classes being intended for this group. Those  who are able to do outdoor work, and for whom some diverting employment  will be beneficial in making them contented and physically healthy, will  live here. There is complete separation of day rooms, but the two sexes  will dine together in an associate hall.    An amusement hall to harmonize with the central group, and to be built  adjacent to it, is planned, and will be built this year if the  appropriation will permit. It is a valuable and necessary adjunct to the  other provisions for the care of a population of 1,500. Accommodations  for entertainments, chapel exercises, dancing and a bathing  establishment are included in the plans in a way that gives great  results with great economy of construction.    Probably the feature in the scheme of the St. Lawrence State Hospital of  the greatest popular and professional interest is Dr. Wise's plan to  have there an Americanized and improved Gheel. The original Gheel in  Belgium is a colony where for many years lunatics have been sent for  domiciliary care. Its inhabitants, mostly of the peasant class, have  grown accustomed to the presence and care of patients with disordered  minds. The system is the outgrowth of a superstition founded in the  presumed miraculous cure of a lunatic whose reason was restored by the  shock of the sight of the killing of a beautiful girl by her pursuing  father, whose fury had been roused by her choice of a husband. A  monument to this unfortunate graces Gheel, and as St. Dymphna she is  supposed to be in benign control of the lunatic-sheltering colony. Some  of the features of the Gheel system of care are also distinctively known  as the Scotch system. There the placing of patients in family care is  common. Massachusetts has also adopted it to a considerable extent. But  there are many objections to family care in isolated domiciles, as  practiced in Massachusetts. Special medical attention and official  visits are made expensive and inconvenient. Dr. Wise plans to get all  the advantages of such a mode of life for patients whose condition  retrogrades under institutional influence. Not the least of these  advantages is that of economy in relieving the State from the per capita  cost of construction for at least one-fourth of the insane of the  district. He would utilize the families in the settlement which always  grows up in the vicinity of a large hospital. It is composed of the  households of employes, many of which are the result of marriages among  the attendants and employes. On Point Airy, by the use of the buildings  that were on the different plots bought by the State to make up the  hospital farm, such a settlement can be easily made up. Its inhabitants  would pay rent to the State. They would be particularly fit and proper  persons to board and care for patients whose condition was suitable for  that sort of a life, and the patients could have many privileges and  benefits not possible in the hospital. Point Airy's little Gheel on such  a plan would be a most interesting and valuable extension of the  beneficent rule of St. Dymphna.    The St. Lawrence State Hospital was built and is operated under the  supervision of a board of managers, whose fidelity to it is described as  phenomenal by the people of Ogdensburg. The members of the executive  committee, Chairman William L. Proctor, Secretary A.E. Smith, John  Hannan and George Hall, especially Mr. Proctor and Mr. Smith, have given  as much time and attention to it as most men would to a matter in which  they had a business interest. The result has been a performance of  contract obligations in which the State got its money's worth. The  people of Ogdensburg, too, have taken a great interest in the  institution. Such men as Mayor Edgar A. Newell, ex-Collector of the Port  of New York Daniel Magone, Postmaster A.A. Smith, Assemblyman George R.  Malby, and his predecessor, Gen. N.M. Curtis, who was the legislative  father of the hospital scheme; Frank Tallman and Amasa Thornton take as  much pride in the institution that the State has set down at the gates  of their city as they do in their cherished and admired city hall, which  combines a tidy little opera house with the quarters necessary for"]]]
