He is very weak and ill, from low          living.                              SONGRUDOLPH.            A pattern to professors of monarchical autonomy,          I don't indulge in levity or compromising bonhomie,          But dignified formality, consistent with economy,                Above all other virtues I particularly prize.          I never join in merrimentI don't see joke or jape any          I never tolerate familiarity in shape any          This, joined with an extravagant respect for                tuppence-ha'penny,                A keynote to my character sufficiently supplies.      (Speaking.)  Observe.  (To Chamberlains.)  My snuff-box!      (The snuff-box is passed with much ceremony from the Junior          Chamberlain, through all the others, until it is presented          by the  Senior Chamberlain to RUDOLPH, who uses it.)            That incident a keynote to my character supplies.      RUD.  I weigh out tea and sugar with precision mathematical          Instead of beer, a penny eachmy orders are emphatical          (Extravagance unpardonable, any more than that I call),            But, on the other hand, my Ducal dignity to keep          All Courtly ceremonialto put it comprehensively          I rigidly insist upon (but not, I hope, offensively)          Whenever ceremonial can be practised inexpensively            And, when you come to think of it, it's really very    cheap!      (Speaking.)  Observe.  (To Chamberlains.)  My handkerchief!      (Handkerchief is handed by Junior Chamberlain to the next in          order, and so on until it reaches RUDOLPH, who is much          inconvenienced by the delay.)            It's sometimes inconvenient, but it's always very cheap!            RUD.  My Lord Chamberlain, as you are aware, my marriage    with the wealthy Baroness von Krakenfeldt will take place    to-morrow, and you will be good enough to see that the rejoicings    are on a scale of unusual liberality.  Pass that on. (Chamberlain    whispers to Vice-Chamberlain, who whispers to the next, and so    on.)  The sports will begin with a Wedding Breakfast Bee.  The    leading pastry-cooks of the town will be invited to compete, and    the winner will not only enjoy the satisfaction of seeing his    breakfast devoured by the Grand Ducal pair, but he will also be    entitled to have the Arms of Pfennig Halbpfennig tattoo'd between    his shoulder-blades.  The Vice-Chamberlain will see to this.  All    the public fountains of Speisesaal will run with Gingerbierheim    and Currantweinmilch at the public expense.  The Assistant    Vice-Chamberlain will see to this.  At night, everybody will    illuminate; and as I have no desire to tax the public funds    unduly, this will be done at the inhabitants' private expense.    The Deputy Assistant Vice-Chamberlain will see to this.  All my    Grand Ducal subjects will wear new clothes, and the Sub-Deputy    Assistant Vice-Chamberlain will collect the usual commission on    all sales.  Wedding presents (which, on this occasion, should be    on a scale of extraordinary magnificence) will be received at the    Palace at any hour of the twenty-four, and the Temporary    Sub-Deputy Assistant Vice-Chamberlain will sit up all night for    this purpose.  The entire population will be commanded to enjoy    themselves, and with this view the Acting Temporary Sub-Deputy    Assistant Vice-Chamberlain will sing comic songs in the    Market-place from noon to nightfall.  Finally, we have composed a    Wedding Anthem, with which the entire population are required to    provide themselves.  It can be obtained from our Grand Ducal    publishers at the usual discount price, and all the Chamberlains    will be expected to push the sale.  (Chamberlains bow and    exeunt).  I don't feel at all comfortable.  I hope I'm not doing    a foolish thing in getting married.  After all, it's a poor heart    that never rejoices, and this wedding of mine is the first little    treat I've allowed myself since my christening.  Besides,    Caroline's income is very considerable, and as her ideas of    economy are quite on a par with mine, it ought to turn out well.    Bless her tough old heart, she's a mean little darling!  Oh, here    she is, punctual to her appointment!      Enter BARONESS VON KRAKENFELDT.            BAR.  Rudolph!  Why, what's the matter?          RUD.  Why, I'm not quite myself, my pet.  I'm a little    worried and upset.  I want a tonic.  It's the low diet, I think.    I am afraid, after all, I shall have to take the bull by the    horns and have an egg with my breakfast.          BAR.  I shouldn't do anything rash, dear.  Begin with a    jujube. (Gives him one.)          RUD. (about to eat it, but changes his mind).  I'll keep it    for supper. (He sits by her and tries to put his arm round her    waist.)          BAR.  Rudolph, don't!  What in the world are you thinking    of?          RUD.  I was thinking of embracing you, my sugarplum.  Just    as a little cheap treat.          BAR.  What, here?  In public?  Really, you appear to have    no    sense of delicacy.          RUD.  No sense of delicacy, Bon-bon!          BAR.  No.  I can't make you out.  When you courted me, all    your courting was done publicly in the Marketplace.  When you    proposed to me, you proposed in the Market-place.  And now that    we're engaged you seem to desire that our first tte-    occur in the Marketplace!  Surely you've a room in your    Palacewith blindsthat would do?          RUD.  But, my own, I can't help myself.  I'm bound by my    own    decree.          BAR.  Your own decree?          RUD.  Yes.  You see, all the houses that give on the    Market-place belong to me, but the drains (which date back to the    reign of Charlemagne) want attending to, and the houses wouldn't    letso, with a view to increasing the value of the property, I    decreed that all love-episodes between affectionate couples    should take place, in public, on this spot, every Monday,    Wednesday, and Friday, when the band doesn't play.          BAR.  Bless me, what a happy idea!  So moral too!  And have    you found it answer?          RUD.  Answer?  The rents have gone up fifty per cent, and    the sale of opera-glasses (which is a Grand Ducal monopoly) has    received an extraordinary stimulus!  So, under the circumstances,    would you allow me to put my arm round your waist?  As a source    of income.  Just once!          BAR.  But it's so very embarrassing.  Think of the    opera-glasses!          RUD.  My good girl, that's just what I am thinking of.    Hang    it all, we must give them something for their money!  What's    that?          BAR.  (unfolding paper, which contains a large letter,    which    she hands to him).  It's a letter which your detective asked me    to hand to you.  I wrapped it up in yesterday's paper to keep it    clean.          RUD.  Oh, it's only his report!  That'll keep.  But, I say,    you've never been and bought a newspaper?          BAR.  My dear Rudolph, do you think I'm mad?  It came    wrapped round my breakfast.          RUD.  (relieved). I thought you were not the sort of girl    to    go and buy a newspaper!  Well, as we've got it, we may as well    read it.  What does it say?          BAR.  Whydear mehere's your biography!  \"Our Detested    Despot!\"          RUD.  YesI fancy that refers to me.          BAR.  And it saysOh, it can't be!          RUD.  What can't be?          BAR.  Why, it says that although you're going to marry me    to-morrow, you were betrothed in infancy to the Princess of Monte    Carlo!          RUD.  Oh yesthat's quite right.  Didn't I mention it?          BAR.  Mention it!  You never said a word about it!          RUD.  Well, it doesn't matter, because, you see, it's    practically off.          BAR.  Practically off?          RUD.  Yes.  By the terms of the contract the betrothal is    void unless the Princess marries before she is of age.  Now, her    father, the Prince, is stony-broke, and hasn't left his house for    years for fear of arrest.  Over and over again he has implored me    to come to him to be married-but in vain.  Over and over again he    has implored me to advance him the money to enable the Princess    to come to mebut in vain.  I am very young, but not as young as    that; and as the Princess comes of age at two tomorrow, why at    two to-morrow I'm a free man, so I appointed that hour for our    wedding, as I shall like to have as much marriage as I can get    for my money.          BAR.  I see.  Of course, if the married state is a happy    state, it's a pity to waste any of it.          RUD.  Why, every hour we delayed I should lose a lot of you    and you'd lose a lot of me!          BAR.  My thoughtful darling!  Oh, Rudolph, we ought to be    very happy!          RUD.  If I'm not, it'll be my first bad investment.  Still,    there is such a thing as a slump even in Matrimonials.          BAR.  I often picture us in the long, cold, dark December    evenings, sitting close to each other and singing impassioned    duets to keep us warm, and thinking of all the lovely things we    could afford to buy if we chose, and, at the same time, planning    out our lives in a spirit of the most rigid and exacting economy!          RUD.  It's a most beautiful and touching picture of    connubial bliss in its highest and most rarefied development!                          DUETBARONESS and RUDOLPH.      BAR.  As o'er our penny roll we sing,                It is not reprehensive          To think what joys our wealth would bring          Were we disposed to do the thing                Upon a scale extensive.          There's rich mock-turtlethick and clear      RUD. (confidentially).  Perhaps we'll have it once a year!      BAR. (delighted).       You are an open-handed dear!      RUD.
