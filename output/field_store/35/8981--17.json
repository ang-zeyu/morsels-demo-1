It was from this room, on an  earlier occasion, that he had heard the ominous movements in the  apartment above. To-day he heard nothing.    \"Benson,\" he called, opening the library door. As the man came along the  hall: \"I have written a note to Mr. Innes, my secretary,\" he explained.  \"There it is, on the table. When the district messenger, for whom you  telephoned, arrives, give him the parcel and the note. He is to accept  no other receipt than that of Mr. Innes.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    Harley took his hat and cane, and Benson opened the front door.    \"Good day, sir,\" said the butler.    \"Good day, Benson,\" called Harley, hurrying out to the waiting cab.  \"Number 236 South Lambeth Road,\" he directed the man.    Off moved the taxi, and Harley lay back upon the cushions heaving a long  sigh. The irksome period of inaction was ended. The cloud which for a  time had dulled his usually keen wits was lifted. He was by no means  sure that enlightenment had come in time, but at least he was in hot  pursuit of a tangible clue, and he must hope that it would lead him,  though tardily, to the heart of this labyrinth which concealed--what?    Which concealed something, or someone, known and feared as Fire-Tongue.    For the moment he must focus upon establishing, beyond query or doubt,  the fact that Sir Charles Abingdon had not died from natural causes.  Premonitions, intuitions, beliefs resting upon a foundation of strange  dreams--these were helpful to himself, if properly employed, but they  were not legal evidence. This first point achieved, the motive of the  crime must be sought; and then--the criminal.    \"One thing at a time,\" Harley finally murmured.    Turning his head, he glanced back at the traffic in the street behind  him. The action was sheerly automatic. He had ceased to expect to  detect the presence of any pursuer. Yet he was convinced that his  every movement was closely watched. It was uncanny, unnerving, this  consciousness of invisible surveillance. Now, as he looked, he started.  The invisible had become the visible.    His cab was just on the point of turning on to the slope of Vauxhall  Bridge. And fifty yards behind, speeding along the Embankment, was a  small French car. The features of the driver he had no time to observe.  But, peering eagerly through the window, showed the dark face of the  passenger. The man's nationality it was impossible to determine, but the  keen, almost savage interest, betrayed by the glittering black eyes, it  was equally impossible to mistake.    If the following car had turned on to the bridge, Harley, even yet,  might have entertained a certain doubt. But, mentally putting himself  in the pursuer's place, he imagined himself detected and knew at once  exactly what he should do. Since this hypothetical course was actually  pursued by the other, Harley's belief was confirmed.    Craning his neck, he saw the little French car turn abruptly and proceed  in the direction of Victoria Station. Instantly he acted.    Leaning out of the window he thrust a ten-shilling note into the  cabman's hand. \"Slow down, but don't pull up,\" he directed. \"I am going  to jump out just as you pass that lorry ahead. Ten yards further on  stop. Get down and crank your engine, and then proceed slowly over the  bridge. I shall not want you again.\"    \"Right-oh, sir,\" said the man, grinning broadly. As a result,  immediately he was afforded the necessary cover, Harley jumped from  the cab. The man reached back and closed the door, proceeding on his  leisurely way. Excepting the driver of the lorry, no one witnessed this  eccentric performance, and Harley, stepping on to the footpath, quietly  joined the stream of pedestrians and strolled slowly along.    He presently passed the stationary cab without giving any sign of  recognition to the dismounted driver. Then, a minute later, the  cab overtook him and was soon lost in the traffic ahead. Even as it  disappeared another cab went by rapidly.    Leaning forward in order to peer through the front window was the  dark-faced man whom he had detected on the Embankment!    \"Quite correct,\" murmured Harley, dryly. \"Exactly what I should have  done.\"    The spy, knowing himself discovered, had abandoned his own car in favour  of a passing taxicab, and in the latter had taken up the pursuit.    Paul Harley lighted a cigarette. Oddly enough, he was aware of a  feeling of great relief. In the first place, his sixth sense had been  triumphantly vindicated; and, in the second place, his hitherto shadowy  enemies, with their seemingly supernatural methods, had been unmasked.  At least they were human, almost incredibly clever, but of no more than  ordinary flesh and blood.    The contest had developed into open warfare. Harley's accurate knowledge  of London had enabled him to locate No. 236 South Lambeth Road without  recourse to a guide, and now, walking on past the big gas works and the  railway station, he turned under the dark arches and pressed on to where  a row of unprepossessing dwellings extended in uniform ugliness from a  partly demolished building to a patch of waste ground.    That the house was being watched he did not doubt. In fact, he no longer  believed subterfuge to be of any avail. He was dealing with dangerously  accomplished criminals. How clever they were he had yet to learn; and it  was only his keen intuitive which at this juncture enabled him to score  a point over his cunning opponents.    He walked quite openly up the dilapidated steps to the door of No.  236, and was about to seize the dirty iron knocker when the door opened  suddenly and a girl came out. She was dressed neatly and wore a pseudo  fashionable hat from which a heavy figured veil depended so as almost  to hide her features. She was carrying a bulging cane grip secured by a  brown leather strap.    Seeing Harley on the step, she paused for a moment, then, recovering  herself:    \"Ellen!\" she shouted down the dim passageway revealed by the opening of  the door. \"Somebody to see you.\"    Leaving the door open, she hurried past the visitor with averted face.  It was well done, and, thus disguised by the thick veil, another man  than Paul Harley might have failed to recognize one of whom he had never  had more than an imperfect glimpse. But if Paul Harley's memory did not  avail him greatly, his unerring instinct never failed.    He grasped the girl's arm. \"One moment, Miss Jones,\" he said, quietly,  \"it is you I am here to see!\"    The girl turned angrily, snatching her arm from his grasp. \"You've made  a mistake, haven't you?\" she cried, furiously. \"I don't know you and I  don't want to!\"    \"Be good enough to step inside again. Don't make a scene. If you behave  yourself, you have nothing to fear. But I want to talk to you.\"    He extended his arm to detain her. But she thrust it aside. \"My boy's  waiting round the corner!\" she said, viciously. \"Just see what he'll do  when I tell him!\"    \"Step inside,\" repeated Harley, quietly. \"Or accompany me to Kennington  Lane Police Station--whichever you think would be the more amusing.\"    \"What d'you mean!\" blustered the girl. \"You can't kid me. I haven't done  anything.\"    \"Then do as I tell you. You have got to answer my questions--either here  or at the station. Which shall it be?\"    He had realized the facts of the situation from the moment when the  girl had made her sudden appearance, and he knew that his only chance of  defeating his cunning opponents was to frighten her. Delicate measures  would be wasted upon such a character. But even as the girl, flinging  herself sullenly about, returned into the passage, he found himself  admiring the resourcefulness of his unknown enemies.    A tired-looking woman carrying a child appeared from somewhere and  stared apathetically at Harley.    Addressing the angry girl: \"Another o' your flames, Polly?\" she inquired  in a dull voice. \"Has he made you change your mind already?\"    The girl addressed as \"Polly\" dropped her grip on the floor and, banging  open a door, entered a shabby little sitting room, followed by Harley.  Dropping onto a ragged couch, she stared obstinately out of the dirty  window.    \"Excuse me, madam, for intruding,\" said Harley to the woman with the  baby, \"but Polly has some information of use to the police. Oh, don't be  alarmed. She has committed no crime. I shall only detain her for a few  minutes.\"    He bowed to the tired-looking woman and closed the sitting-room door.  \"Now, young woman,\" he said, sternly, adopting this official manner of  his friend, Inspector Wessex, \"I am going to give you one warning, and  one only. Although I don't think you know it, you have got mixed up with  a gang of crooks. Play the game with me, and I'll stand by you. Try any  funny business and you'll go to jail.\"    The official manner had its effect. Miss Jones looked sharply across at  the speaker. \"I haven't done anything,\" she said, sullenly.    Paul Harley advanced and stood over her. \"What about the trick with the  serviettes at Sir Charles Abingdon's?\" he asked, speaking the words in  slow and deliberate fashion.    The shaft went home, but the girl possessed a stock of obstinate  courage. \"What about it?\" she inquired, but her voice had changed.    \"Who made you do it?\"    \"What's that to you?\"    Paul Harley drew out his watch, glanced at the face, and returned the  timepiece to his pocket. \"I have warned you,\" he said. \"In exactly three  minutes' time I shall put you under arrest.\"    The girl suddenly lifted her veil and, raising her face, looked up at  him. At last he had broken down her obstinate resistance. Already he had  noted the coarse, elemental formation of her hands, and now, the veil  removed, he saw that she belonged to a type of character often found  in Wales and closely duplicated in certain parts of London. There was  a curious flatness of feature and prominence of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11602"],[0,"The World of Ice (#16)"],[1,"to extricate  himself.    His position was rendered all the more aggravating by the fact that, a  week after he was beset, the main body of the ice in the strait opened  up and drifted to the southward, leaving a comparatively clear sea  through which he could have pushed his way without much difficulty in  any direction; but the solid masses in which they lay embedded were fast  to the ground for about fifty yards beyond the vessel, seaward, and  until these should be floated away there was no chance of escape.    \"Get up some powder and canisters, Mr. Bolton,\" he exclaimed, one  morning after breakfast, \"I'll try what can be done by blasting the  ice. The highest spring tide will occur to-morrow, and if the ship don't  move then we shall--\"    He did not finish the sentence, but turned on his heel and walked  forward, where he found Buzzby and some of the men preparing the  ice-saws.    \"Ay, ay,\" muttered the mate, as he went below to give the necessary  directions, \"you don't need to conclude your speech, captain. If we  don't get out to-morrow, we're locked up for one winter, at least, if  not more.\"    \"Ay, and ye'll no get oot to-morrow,\" remarked Saunders, with a shake of  his head as he looked up from the log-book in which he was making an  entry. \"We're hard and fast, so we'll just have to make the best o't.\"    Saunders was right, as the efforts of the next day proved. The ice lay  around the vessel in solid masses, as we have said, and with each of the  last three tides these masses had been slightly moved. Saws and ice  chisels, therefore, had been in constant operation, and the men worked  with the utmost energy, night and day, taking it by turns, and having  double allowance of hot coffee served out to them. We may mention here  that the _Dolphin_ carried no spirits, except what was needed for  medicinal purposes, and for fuel to several small cooking lamps that had  been recently invented. It had now been proved by many voyagers of  experience that in cold countries, as well as hot, men work harder, and  endure the extremity of hardship better, without strong drink than with  it, and the _Dolphin's_ crew were engaged on the distinct understanding  that coffee, and tea, and chocolate were to be substituted for rum, and  that spirits were never to be given to any one on board, except in cases  of extreme necessity.    But, to return--although the men worked as only those can who toil for  liberation from long imprisonment, no impression worth mentioning could  be made on the ice. At length the attempt to rend it by means of  gunpowder was made.    A jar containing about thirty pounds of powder was sunk in a hole in an  immense block of ice which lay close against the stern of the ship.  Mivins, being light of foot, was set to fire the train. He did so, and  ran--ran so fast that he missed his footing in leaping over a chasm, and  had well-nigh fallen into the water below. There was a whiz and a loud  report, and the enormous mass of ice heaved upwards in the centre, and  fell back in huge fragments. So far the result was satisfactory, and the  men were immediately set to sink several charges in various directions  around the vessel, to be in readiness for the highest tide, which was  soon expected. Warps and hawsers were also got out and fixed to the  seaward masses, ready to heave on them at a moment's notice; the ship  was lightened as much as possible by lifting her stores upon the ice;  and the whole crew--captain, mates, and all--worked and heaved like  horses, until the perspiration streamed from their faces, while Mizzle  kept supplying them with a constant deluge of hot coffee. Fred and the  young surgeon, too, worked like the rest, with their coats off,  handkerchiefs bound round their heads, and shirt-sleeves tucked up to  their shoulders.    At last the tide rose--inch by inch, and slowly, as if it grudged to  give them even a chance of escape.    Mivins grew impatient and unbelieving under it. \"I don't think it'll  rise another hinch,\" he remarked to O'Riley, who stood near him.    \"Niver fear, boy. The capting knows a sight better than you do, and _he_  says it'll rise a fut yit.\"    \"Does he?\" asked Grim, who was also beginning to despond.    \"Ov coorse he does. Sure he towld me in a confidintial way, just before  he wint to turn in last night--if it wasn't yisturday forenoon, for it's  meself as niver knows an hour o' the day since the sun became  dissipated, and tuck to sitting up all night in this fashion.\"    \"Shut up yer tatie-trap and open yer weather-eye,\" muttered Buzzby, who  had charge of the gang; \"there'll be time enough to speak after we're  off.\"    Gradually, as the tide rose, the ice and the ship moved, and it became  evident that the latter was almost afloat, though the former seemed to  be only partly raised from the ground. The men were at their several  posts ready for instant action, and gazing in anxious expectation at the  captain, who stood, watch in hand, ready to give the word.    \"Now, then, fire!\" he said in a low voice.    In a moment the ice round the ship was rent, and upheaved, as if some  leviathan of the deep were rising from beneath it, and the vessel swung  slowly round. A loud cheer burst from the men.    \"Now, lads, heave with a will!\" roared the captain.    Round went the capstan, the windlass clanked, and the ship forged slowly  ahead, as the warps and hawsers became rigid. At that moment a heavy  block of ice, which had been overbalanced by the motion of the vessel,  fell with a crash on the rudder, splitting off a large portion of it,  and drawing the iron bolts that held it completely out of the  stern-post.    \"Never mind; heave away--for your lives!\" cried the captain. \"Jump on  board, all of you!\"    The few men who had until now remained on the ice scrambled up the side.  There was a sheet of ice right ahead which the ship could not clear, but  which she was pushing out to sea in advance of her. Suddenly this took  the ground and remained motionless.    \"Out there with ice-chisels! Sink a hole like lightning! Prepare a  canister, Mr. Bolton--quick!\" shouted the captain in desperation, as he  sprang over the side and assisted to cut into the unwieldy obstruction.  The charge was soon fixed and fired, but it only split the block in two  and left it motionless as before. A few minutes after the ship again  grounded; the ice settled round her; the spring tide was lost, and they  were not delivered.    Those who know the bitterness of repeated disappointment and of hope  deferred, may judge of the feelings with which the crew of the _Dolphin_  now regarded their position. Little, indeed, was said, but the grave  looks of most of the men, and the absence of the usual laugh, and jest,  and disposition to skylark, which, on almost all other occasions  characterized them, showed too plainly how heavily the prospect of a  winter in the Arctic Regions weighed upon their spirits. They continued  their exertions to free the ship, however, for several days after the  high tide, and did not finally give in until all reasonable hope of  moving her was utterly annihilated. Before this, however, a reaction  began to take place; the prospects of the coming winter were discussed;  and some of the more sanguine looked even beyond the winter, and began  to consider how they would contrive to get the ship out of her position  into deep water again.    Fred Ellice, too, thought of his father, and this abrupt check to the  search, and his spirits sank again as his hopes decayed. But poor Fred,  like the others, at last discovered that it was of no use to repine, and  that it was best to face his sorrows and difficulties \"like a man!\"    Alas! poor human nature; how difficult do we find it to face sorrows and  difficulties _cheerfully_, even when we do conscientiously try! Well  would it be for all of us could we submit to such, not only because  they are inevitable, but because they are the will of God--of him who  has asserted in his own Word that \"he afflicteth not the children of men  willingly.\"    Among so many men there were all shades of character, and the fact that  they were doomed to a year's imprisonment in the Frozen Regions was  received in very different ways. Some looked grave and thought of it  seriously; others laughed and treated it lightly; a few grumbled and  spoke profanely; but most of them became quickly reconciled, and in a  week or two nearly all forgot the past and the future in the duties, and  cares, and amusements of the present. Captain Guy and his officers,  however, and a few of the more sedate men, among whom were Buzzby and  Peter Grim, looked forward with much anxiety, knowing full well the  dangers and trials that lay before them.    It is true the ship was provisioned for more than a year, but most of  the provisions were salt, and Tom Singleton could have told them, had  they required to be told, that without fresh provisions they stood a  poor chance of escaping that dire disease scurvy, before which have  fallen so many gallant tars whom nothing in the shape of dangers or  difficulties could subdue. There were, indeed, myriads of wild-fowl  flying about the ship, on which the men feasted and grew fat every day;  and the muskets of Meetuck and those who accompanied him seldom failed  to supply the ship with an abundance of the flesh of seals, walruses,  and Polar bears, portions of all of which creatures were considered very  good indeed by the men, and particularly by the dogs, which grew so fat  that they began to acquire a very disreputable waddle in their gait as  they walked the deck for exercise, which they seldom did, by the way,  being passionately fond of sleep! But birds, and perchance beasts, might  be expected to take themselves off when the winter arrived, and leave  the crew without fresh food.    Then, although the _Dolphin_ was supplied with every necessary for a  whaling-expedition, and with many"]]]
