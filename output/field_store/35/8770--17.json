Organize      yourselves; prepare every needful thing, and establish a house,      even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a      house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of      God. That your incomings may be in the name of the Lord, that your      outgoings may be in the name of the Lord, that all your salutations      may be in the name of the Lord, with uplifted hands to the Most      High.'        \"And now, Holy Father, we ask thee to assist us, thy people, with      thy grace, in calling our solemn assembly, that it may be done      to thy honor, and to thy divine acceptance. And in a manner that      we may be found worthy in thy sight, to secure a fulfillment of      the promises which thou hast made unto us, thy people, in the      revelations given unto us; that thy glory may rest down upon thy      people, and upon this thy house, which we now dedicate to thee,      that it may be sanctified and consecrated to be holy, and that      thy holy presence may be continually in this house, and that all      people who shall enter upon the threshold of the Lord's house may      feel thy power, and feel constrained to acknowledge that thou hast      sanctified it, and that it is thy house, a place of thy holiness.      And do thou grant, Holy Father, that all those who shall worship in      this house, may be taught words of wisdom out of the best books,      and that they may seek learning even by study, and also by faith,      as thou hast said; and that they may grow up in thee, and receive      a fullness of the Holy Ghost and be organized according to thy      laws, and be prepared to obtain every needful thing; and that this      house may be a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of      faith, a house of glory and of God, even thy house; that all the      incomings of thy people, into this house, may be in the name of the      Lord; that all the outgoings from this house may be in the name of      the Lord; arid that all their salutations may be in the name of      the Lord, with holy hands, uplifted to the Most High; and that no      unclean thing shall be permitted to come into thy house to pollute      it; and when thy people transgress, any of them, they may speedily      repent, and return unto thee, and find favor in thy sight, and be      restored to the blessings which thou hast ordained to be poured out      upon those who shall reverence thee in thy house. And we ask thee,      Holy Father, that thy servants may go forth from this house, armed      with thy power, and thy name may be upon them, and thy glory be      round about them, and thine angels have charge over them; and from      this place they may bear exceedingly great and glorious tidings, in      truth, unto the ends of the earth, that they may know that this is      thy work, and that thou hast put forth thy hand, to fulfill that      which thou hast spoken by the mouths of the prophets, concerning      the last days. We ask thee, Holy Father, to establish the people      that shall worship and honorably hold a name and standing in this      thy house, to all generations, and for eternity, that no weapon      formed against them shall prosper; that he who diggeth a pit for      them shall fall into the same himself; that no combination of      wickedness shall have power to rise up and prevail over thy people      upon whom thy name shall be put in this house; and if any people      shall rise against this people, that thy anger be kindled against      them, and if they shall smite this people thou wilt smite them,      thou wilt fight for thy people as thou didst in the day of battle,      that they may be delivered from the hands of all their enemies.        \"We ask thee, Holy Father, to confound, and astonish, and to bring      to shame and confusion, all those who have spread lying reports      abroad, over the world, against thy servant, or servants, if they      will not repent when the everlasting gospel shall be proclaimed in      their ears, and that all their works may be brought to naught, and      be swept away by, the hail, and by the judgments which thou wilt      send upon them in thy anger, that there may be an end to lyings and      slanders against thy people; for thou knowest, O Lord, that thy      servants have been innocent before thee in bearing record of thy      name, for which they have suffered these things; therefore we plead      before thee a full and complete deliverance from under this yoke;      break it off, O Lord; break it off from the necks of thy servants,      by thy power, that we may rise up in the midst of this generation      and do thy work.        \"O Jehovah, have mercy on this people, and as all men sin, forgive      the transgressions of thy people, and let them be blotted out      forever. Let the anointing of thy ministers be sealed upon them      with power from on high; let it be fulfilled upon them as upon      those on the day of pentecost; let the gift of tongues be poured      out upon thy people, even cloven tongues as of fire, and the      interpretation thereof, and let thy house be filled, as with a      rushing mighty wind, with thy glory. Put upon thy servants the      testimony of the covenant, that when they go out and proclaim      thy word, they may seal up the law, and prepare the hearts of      thy saints for all those judgments thou art about to send, in      thy wrath, upon the inhabitants of the earth, because of their      transgressions; that thy people may not faint in the day of      trouble. And whatsoever city thy servants shall enter, and the      people of that city receive their testimony, let thy peace and      thy salvation be upon that city, that they may gather out of that      city the righteous, that they may come forth to Zion, or to her      stakes, the places of thy appointment, with songs of everlasting      joy; and until this be accomplished, let not thy judgments fall      upon this city. And whatsoever city thy servants shall enter,      and the people of that city receive not the testimony of thy      servants, and thy servants warn them to save themselves from this      untoward generation, let it be upon that city according to that      which thou hast spoken by the mouths of thy prophets; but deliver      thou, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, thy servants from their hands,      and cleanse them from their blood. O Lord, we delight not in the      destruction of our fellow men! Their souls are precious before      thee; but thy word must be fulfilled; help thy servants to say,      with thy grace assisting them, thy will be done, O Lord, and not      ours. We know that thou hast spoken by the mouth of thy prophets      terrible things concerning the wicked, in the last days--that      thou wilt pour out thy judgments without measure; therefore, O      Lord, deliver thy people from the calamity of the wicked; enable      thy servants to seal up the law, and bind up the testimony, that      they may be prepared against the day of burning. We ask thee, Holy      Father, to remember those who have been driven (by the inhabitants      of Jackson county, Missouri), from the lands of their inheritance,      and break off, O Lord, this yoke of affliction that has been put      upon them. Thou knowest, O Lord, that they have been greatly      oppressed and afflicted by wicked men, and our hearts flow out with      sorrow, because of their grievous burdens. O Lord, how long wilt      thou suffer this people to bear this affliction, and the cries of      their innocent ones to ascend up in thine ears, and their blood      come up in testimony before thee, and not make a display of thy      testimony in their behalf? Have mercy, O Lord, upon that wicked      mob, who have driven thy people, that they may cease to spoil, that      they may repent of their sins, if repentance is to be found; but if      they will not, make bare thine arm, O Lord, and redeem that which      thou didst appoint a Zion unto thy people.        \"And if it cannot be otherwise, that the cause of thy people      may not fail before thee, may thine anger be kindled, and thine      indignation fall upon them, that they may be wasted away, both root      and branch, from under heaven; but inasmuch as they will repent,      thou art gracious and merciful, and wilt turn away thy wrath,      when thou lookest upon the face of thine anointed. Have mercy,      O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth; have mercy upon the      rulers of our land; may those principles which were so honorably      and nobly defended, viz.: the constitution of our land, by our      fathers, be established forever. Remember the kings, the princes,      the nobles, and the great ones of the earth, and all people, and      the churches, all the poor, the needy and afflicted ones of the      earth, that their hearts may be softened, when thy servants shall      go out from thy house, O Jehovah, to bear testimony of thy name,      that their prejudices may give way before the truth, and thy people      may obtain favor in the sight of all, that all the ends of the      earth may know that we thy servants have heard thy voice, and that      thou hast sent us; that from all these, thy servants, the sons of      Jacob, may gather out the righteous to build a holy city to thy      name, as thou hast commanded them. We ask thee to appoint unto Zion      other stakes, besides this one which thou hast appointed, that the      gathering of thy people may roll on in great power and majesty,      that thy work may be cut short in righteousness. Now these words,      O Lord, we have spoken before thee, concerning the revelations and      commandments which thou hast given unto us, who are identified with      the Gentiles; but thou knowest that thou hast a great love for the      children of Jacob, who have been scattered upon the mountains,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],[0,"Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#15)"],[1," life; kill me, if you  please.\"    After repeated failures to have him executed in a legal way, his  enemies said:    \"If we cannot reach him by law, powder and ball shall,\" which was at  last fulfilled at the well-curb at Carthage jail.    \"Our Patriarch and Prophet, too, Were massacred; they bled To seal  their testimony,--They were numbered with the dead, Ah, tell me, are  they sleeping?
