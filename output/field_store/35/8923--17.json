Occasionally, two old rubbers that are comparatively soft may  be used in place of a new one, and sometimes old rubbers are dipped in  paraffin and then used. However, if there is any difficulty in sealing  jars properly with rubbers so treated, they should be discarded and good  ones used.    25. TIN CANS.--For household canning, tin cans are not so convenient as  glass jars, but in spite of this they are coming into extensive use. The  kind that may be used without any special equipment has a tin lid that  fits into a groove and is fastened in place with rosin or sealing wax.  Some cans, however, require that the lids be soldered in place. While  soldering requires special equipment, this method of making the cans  air-tight is the best, and it is employed where considerable canning is  done, as by canning clubs or commercial canners.    [Illustration: FIG. 5]    In the purchase of tin cans, the size of the opening should receive  consideration. If large fruits and vegetables, such as peaches, pears,  and tomatoes, are to be canned, the opening must be a large one;  whereas, if peas, beans, corn, and other small vegetables or fruits are  to be canned, cans having a smaller opening may be chosen. When acid  fruits or vegetables are to be canned, use should be made of cans that  are coated with shellac, as this covering on the inside of the cans  prevents any action of the acid on the tin.           *       *       *       *       *    CANNING METHODS    GENERAL DISCUSSION    26. The methods employed for the canning of foods include the  _open-kettle method_, the _cold-pack method_, the _steam-pressure  method_, and the _oven method_. Of these, the open-kettle method is  perhaps the oldest household method of canning, and it is still used by  many housewives. The other methods, which are newer, seem troublesome to  the housewife who is familiar with the open-kettle method, yet it will  only be fair to give the new methods a trial before deciding which to  use. The one-period cold-pack method has much to recommend it. Foods  canned in this way undergo less change in form and flavor than those  canned by the open-kettle method; besides, there is less danger of  spoiling. In fact, many foods, such as vegetables and meats, that cannot  be canned satisfactorily by the open-kettle method will keep perfectly  if they are carefully preserved by the one-period cold-pack method. The  steam-pressure method requires the use of special equipment, as is  explained later. While it is a very acceptable canning method, it is not  accessible in many homes. The oven method is liked by many housewives,  but it offers almost the same chance for contamination as does the  open-kettle method.      OPEN-KETTLE METHOD    27. The OPEN-KETTLE METHOD of canning is very simple and requires no  equipment other than that to be found in every kitchen. It consists in  thoroughly cooking the food that is to be canned, transferring it to  containers, and sealing them immediately.    28. UTENSILS REQUIRED.--Not many utensils are required for the  open-kettle canning method. For cooking the food, a large enamel or  metal vessel other than tin or iron should be provided. It should be  broad and shallow, rather than deep, especially for fruit, as this food  retains its shape better if it is cooked in a layer that is not deep.  The other utensils for canning fruits and vegetables by this method are  practically the same as those already discussed--measuring utensils, a  knife, large spoons, pans for sterilizing jars or cans, covers, rubbers,  and jars or cans into which to put the food.    29. PROCEDURE.--The first step in the open-kettle canning method  consists in sterilizing the containers. To do this, first clean the  jars, covers, and rubbers by washing them and then boiling them in clear  water for 15 to 20 minutes.    Next, attention should be given to the food that is to be canned. Look  it over carefully, cut out any decayed portions, and wash it thoroughly.  Sometimes roots, leaves, stems, or seeds are removed before washing, and  sometimes this is not done until after washing. At any rate, all dirt or  foreign material must be washed from foods before they are ready  for canning.    After preparing the food, it must be cooked. If fruit is being canned,  put it into the required sirup, the making of which is explained later,  and cook it until it is well softened, as if preparing it for immediate  table use. If vegetables are being canned, cook them in the same way,  but use salt and water instead of sirup. When the food is cooked,  transfer it to the sterile jars and seal at once with the sterile  rubbers and covers. Then invert each jar to permit the food to cool and  to test for leaks.    30. The danger of not securing good results with the open-kettle method  lies in the possibility of contaminating the contents before the jar is  closed and sealed. In addition to having the jars, rubbers, and covers  sterile, therefore, all spoons and other utensils used to handle the  cooked food must be sterile. Likewise, the jars must be filled to the  top and the covers put on and made as firm and tight as possible at  once, so that as few bacteria as possible will enter. If screw-top cans  are used, the tops should not be twisted or turned after cooling, as  this may affect the sealing. If jars leak upon being turned upside down,  the contents must be removed and reheated and the jar must be fitted  with another cover. Then both jar and cover must be sterilized and the  contents returned and sealed immediately.      COLD-PACK METHOD    31. The COLD-PACK METHOD of canning differs from the open-kettle method  in that the food to be canned is not cooked in a kettle before placing  it in the jars and sealing them. In this method, the food to be canned  is prepared by washing, peeling, scraping, hulling, stemming, seeding,  or cutting, depending on the kind. Then it is _scalded_ or _blanched_  and plunged into cold water quickly and taken out immediately, the  latter operation being called _cold-dipping_. After this it is placed  into hot jars, covered with boiling liquid--boiling water and salt for  vegetables, meats, fish, or soups, and boiling sirup for fruits. Then  the filled jars are covered loosely and placed in a water bath and  _processed_; that is, cooked and sterilized. When food that is being  canned is subjected to processing only once, the method is referred to  as the _one-period cold-pack method_; but when the food in the jars has  not been blanched and cold-dipped and is processed, allowed to stand 24  hours and then processed again, and this operation repeated, it is  called the _fractional-sterilization method_. The equipment required for  the cold-pack canning method and the procedure in performing the work  are taken up in detail, so that every point concerning the work may be  thoroughly understood.    [Illustration: FIG. 6]    32. UTENSILS REQUIRED.--The utensils required for canning by the  cold-pack method are shown assembled in Fig. 6. Chief among them is a  _sterilizer_, or boiler, which consists of a large fiat-bottomed vessel  fitted with a rack and a tight-fitting cover. A number of such devices  are manufactured for canning by the cold-pack method, but it is possible  to improvise one in the home. A wash boiler, a large pail, a large lard  can, or, in fact, any large vessel with a flat bottom into which is  fitted a rack of some kind to keep the jars 3/4 inch above the bottom  can be used. Several layers of wire netting cut to correct size and  fastened at each end to a 3/4-inch strip of wood will do very well for a  rack. In any event, the vessel must be deep enough to allow the water to  cover the jars completely and must have a tight-fitting cover. Besides a  sterilizer, there are needed three large vessels, one for scalding the  food that is to be canned, one for cold-dipping, and one for keeping the  jars hot. To hold the food that is to be dipped, a sieve, a wire  basket, also shown in Fig. 6, or a large square of cheesecloth must also  be provided, and for placing jars in the water bath, a can lifter, a  type of which is shown on the table in Fig. 6, may be needed. The  remainder of the equipment is practically the same as that described  under the heading General Equipment for Canning.      PROCEDURE IN THE ONE-PERIOD COLD-PACK METHOD    33. PREPARING THE CONTAINERS.--The first step in the cold-pack method  consists in preparing the containers for the food. The jars, rubbers,  and covers, however, do not have to be sterilized as in the open-kettle  method. But it is necessary first to test and cleanse the jars and then  to keep them hot, so that later, when they are filled and ready to be  placed in the water bath, they will not crack by coming in contact with  boiling water. The best way in which to keep the jars hot is to let them  stand in hot water.    [Illustration: FIG. 7]    34. PREPARATION OF THE FOOD.--Attention should next be directed to the  preparation of the food to be canned; that is, clean it and have it  ready for the processes that follow. The fruits or vegetables may be  canned whole or in pieces of any desirable size. What to do with them is  explained later, when the directions for canning the different kinds are  discussed. While the food is undergoing preparation, fill the sterilizer  with hot water and allow it to come to the boiling point.    35. SCALDING AND BLANCHING.--When the food is made ready, the next step  is to scald or blanch it. Scalding is done to loosen the skin of such  food as peaches, plums, and tomatoes, so that they may be peeled  easily. To scald such fruits or vegetables, dip them quickly into  boiling water and allow them to remain there just long enough to loosen  the skin. If they are ripe, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9943"],[0,"Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia, in Search of a (#15)"],[1,"in the journey. We proceeded over firmer ground,  having the river almost always in sight, until, after travelling about  six miles, our guide showed me the river, much increased in width, and  said they called that the \"Barwan.\" As it was still a mere chain of  ponds, though these were large, I was sure this was not the main channel;  he also said this joined the main channel a good way lower down. I was  convinced that it was only the Castlereagh that had thus augmented the  channel of the Macquarie, which I found afterwards to be the case, the  junction taking place two miles higher. I willingly encamped on it,  however, to afford more time for the lost man, and the man sent after  him, to rejoin the party.    I this day gave \"Yulliyally,\" our guide, the promised tomahawk, a pipe,  tobacco; and, in addition, a shirt; also a few lines to Mr. Kinghorne,  certifying that this native had done what he had engaged to do.  Thermometer at sunrise, 62 deg.; at noon, 94 deg.; at 4 P.M., 97 deg.; at 9, 70 deg.;--  with wet bulb, 57 deg..    28TH FEBRUARY.--The wheelwright and Mortimer came into the camp at 6  A.M., bringing back the horse of the former, and one of the lost  bullocks. We set out early, and after travelling about six miles I came  upon a cart-track, which I followed to the westward until overtaken by a  stockman, who informed me that the Wammerawa, on which I had been  encamped, joined the Barwan, then on my right, within two miles of the  spot on which we stood; that he belonged to the cattle station of Mr.  Parnell, Jun., which was distant from my last camp about five miles, and  on the main river; also that the track I was following led to Mohanna,  Mr. Lawson's station, seventy-five miles lower down the Barwan. I turned  with him towards the junction of the Macquarie and Barwan, and encamped  thereby, right glad to reach at length, the river beyond which our  exploratory tour was to commence. The river looked well, with a good  current of muddy water in it, of considerable width, and really like a  river. I understood from my guide to this point, that there was a good  ford across the river at his station; also that Commissioner Mitchell had  been down the river a short time back, making a map to show all the  cattle stations on both banks. We had neither seen nor heard anything of  Mr. Wright, the commissioner of the Macquarie district through which we  had just passed, except that he \"might visit the district when the hot  weather was over.\" Here we found a new species of CALOTIS.[*] Thermometer  at sunrise, 61 deg.; at noon, 101 deg.; at 4 P.M., 100 deg.; at 9, with wet bulb,  62 deg..    [* Calotis SCAPIGERA (Hook. MSS.); stolonifera glaberrima, foliis omnibus  radicalibus lineari-spathulatis, scapo nudo monocephalo, achenii aristis  robustis subulatis retrorsum pilosis apice rectis vel uncinatis.--A very  distinct species. Habit of BRACHYSTEPHIUM SCAPIGERUM D. C.: but that  ought to have no aristae to the achenium: here the awns are very stout in  proportion to the size of the capitulum.]    1ST MARCH.--When, fifteen years before, I visited this river at a higher  point where it was called the Karaula [*], no trace of hoofs of horses or  bullocks had been previously imprinted on the clayey banks. Now, we found  it to be the last resource of numerous herds in a dry and very hot  season, and so thickly studded were the banks of this river with cattle  stations, that we felt comparatively at home. The ordinary precautionary  arrangements of my camp against surprise by savage natives seemed quite  unnecessary, and, to stockmen, almost ridiculous. We had at length  arrived at the lowest drain of that vast basin of clay absorbing many  rivers, so that they lose themselves as in the ocean. Here the final  outlet or channel of the waters of the Macquarie, was but a muddy ditch  one might step across, which the magnificent flood we had seen in the  same river above the marshes was not at all likely to reach. That flood  had gone to fill thousands of lagoons, without which supply, those vast  regions had been unfit for animal existence. Here we discover another  instance of that wonderful wisdom which becomes more and more apparent to  man, when he either looks as far as he can into space, or attentively  examines the arrangement of any matter more accessible to him. The very  slight inclination of the surface of these extensive plains seems finely  adapted to the extremely dry and warm climate over this part of the  earth. If the interior slope of the land from the eastern coastranges  were as great as that in other countries supplying rivers of sustained  current, it is obvious that no water would remain in such inclined  channels here; but the slope is so gentle that the waters spread into a  net-work of reservoirs, that serve to irrigate vast plains, and fill  lagoons with those floods that, when confined in any one continuous  channel, would at once run off into the ocean.    [* We then understood the natives very imperfectly and might have been  wrong about the name, which is the more likely, as CARAWY, which the name  resembles, means any deep water-hole.]    In a wet season, the country through which we had traced out a route with  our wheels had been impassable. The direction I should have preferred,  and in which I had endeavoured to proceed, was along the known limits of  this basin, and formed a curved line, or an arc, to which the route  necessity had obliged us to follow was the chord; thus we had not lost  time; but had, in fact, shortened the distance to be travelled over very  considerably. A permanent route had, however, seemed to me more desirable  to any country we might discover, than one liable to be interrupted by  flooded rivers and soft impassable ground. The track of our drays, along  the western side of the Macquarie marshes opened a new and direct route  from Sydney to the banks of the river Darling, by way of Bathurst; and  afforded access to a vast extent of excellent pasturage on the Macquarie,  along the western margin of the marshes, which land would, no doubt, be  soon taken up by squatters. In so dry a climate, and where water is so  frequently scarce, it may, indeed, be found that the shortest line of  route with such advantages would be more frequented than any longer line,  possessing only the remote advantage of security from interruption by too  much water. Thermometer at sunrise, 64 deg.; at noon, 100 deg.; at 4 P.M., 101 deg.;  at 9, 81 deg.; with wet bulb, 61 deg..    2ND MARCH--MONDAY. I took a ride to examine the ford at Wyabry, (Mr.  Parnell, Jun.'s station,) which I found practicable for our drays,  although, for their descent and ascent, it was necessary to cut better  approaches on each side. The Macquarie, although the channel was so  attenuated and ditch-like, was likely to prove also an obstacle without  some work of the same kind. Accordingly, on my return to the camp, I sent  some men to the last-mentioned work.    I learnt from natives whom I met at Mr. Parnell's station, that the  rivers Bolloon, Culgoa, and Biree were then flowing, some abundant rains  having fallen about their sources. Also, from the stockman, that the  Narran was thirty-five miles distant, but that a native could be found to  guide me to water only ten miles off. Water was also to be obtained at a  distance of only seven miles beyond the Barwan there at the \"Morella  Ridges,\" to which the natives were in the habit of resorting at certain  seasons, by a path of their own, to gather a fruit of which they were  very fond, named by them \"Moguile,\" and which I had previously  ascertained to be that formerly discovered by me, and named by Dr.  Lindley CAPPARIS MITCHELLII.[*] We found back from this camp the  RUTIDOSIS HELYCHRYSOIDES of De Candolle. Thermometer at sunrise, 72 deg.; at  noon, 101 deg.; at 4 P.M.; 100 deg.; at 9, 78 deg.; and with wet bulb, 62 deg..    [* See \"Three Expeditions,\" etc., vol. i. page 315.]    3D MARCH.--Early this morning a party of men were sent to cut better  approaches to the ford across the Barwan at Mr. Parnell's station.  Ascertained the longitude of the junction of the rivers Macquarie and  Darling at our present camp to be 147 deg. 33' 45\" E., by actual measurements  connected with my former surveys of the colony. Mr. Kennedy had chained  the whole of the route from Bellaringa, and I had connected his work with  latitudes observed at almost every encampment, and after determining at  various points the magnetic variation, which appeared to be very steady,  I made the latitude of this camp 30 deg. 6' 11\" south. Thermometer at  sunrise, 72 deg.; at noon, 99 deg.; at 4 P.M., 97 deg.; at 9, 72 deg.; and with wet bulb,  65 deg.. The height above the sea level of the bed of the river here, the  average result of eight observations, as calculated by Capt. King, was  415 feet.    4TH MARCH.--The party moved off towards the ford over the Barwan at  Wyabry, crossing the bed of the Macquarie about half a mile above its  junction with the Barwan; there, although the approaches had been well  enough cut, we found the bottom too soft for our heavy vehicles, one of  which dipped its wheel to near the axle. We were obliged to pave the soft  and muddy bed with logs, and to cover these with branches, on which earth  was thrown, ere the rest could be got across. The party arrived about  noon at Wyabry, and by 2 P.M. the whole was safely encamped on the right  bank of the Barwan. I had received this morning a dispatch from my son,  commissioner of this district, in which he gave me a most favourable  account of several rivers he had explored in the direction of my proposed  route. These dispatches came to me at the last camp by the hands of a  native, in forty-four hours after the superintendent of Mr. Lawson, being  then on his way down the river, had promised to send them to me, from a  station forty-five miles off, towards Fort Bourke, where it had been"]]]
