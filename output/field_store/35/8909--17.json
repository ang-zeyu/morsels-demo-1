I think I shall take it easy and  fall slower, or I'm likely to get dizzy. Is it very far to the other  side of the world?\"    \"Haven't you ever been through this Tube before?\" inquired Shaggy.    \"Never. Nor has anyone else in our country; at least, not since I was  born.\"    \"How long ago was that?\" asked Betsy.    \"That I was born? Oh, not very long ago. I'm only a mere child. If I  had not been sent on this journey, I would have celebrated my three  thousand and fifty-sixth birthday next Thursday. Mother was going to  make me a birthday cake with three thousand and fifty-six candles on  it; but now, of course, there will be no celebration, for I fear I  shall not get home in time for it.\"    \"Three thousand and fifty-six years!\" cried Betsy. \"Why, I had no idea  anything could live that long!\"    \"My respected Ancestor, whom I would call a stupid old humbug if I had  not reformed, is so old that I am a mere baby compared with him,\" said  Quox. \"He dates from the beginning of the world, and insists on telling  us stories of things that happened fifty thousand years ago, which are  of no interest at all to youngsters like me. In fact, Grandpa isn't up  to date. He lives altogether in the past, so I can't see any good  reason for his being alive to-day.... Are you people able to see your  way, or shall I turn on more light?\"    \"Oh, we can see very nicely, thank you; only there's nothing to see but  ourselves,\" answered Betsy.    This was true. The dragon's big eyes were like headlights on an  automobile and illuminated the Tube far ahead of them. Also he curled  his tail upward so that the electric light on the end of it enabled  them to see one another quite clearly. But the Tube itself was only  dark metal, smooth as glass but exactly the same from one of its ends  to the other. Therefore there was no scenery of interest to beguile the  journey.    They were now falling so gently that the trip was proving entirely  comfortable, as the Jinjin had promised it would be; but this meant a  longer journey and the only way they could make time pass was to engage  in conversation. The dragon seemed a willing and persistent talker and  he was of so much interest to them that they encouraged him to chatter.  His voice was a little gruff but not unpleasant when one became used to  it.    \"My only fear,\" said he presently, \"is that this constant sliding over  the surface of the Tube will dull my claws. You see, this hole isn't  straight down, but on a steep slant, and so instead of tumbling freely  through the air I must skate along the Tube. Fortunately, there is a  file in my tool-kit, and if my claws get dull they can be sharpened  again.\"    \"Why do you want sharp claws?\" asked Betsy.    \"They are my natural weapons, and you must not forget that I have been  sent to conquer Ruggedo.\"    \"Oh, you needn't mind about that,\" remarked Queen Ann, in her most  haughty manner; \"for when we get to Ruggedo I and my invincible Army  can conquer him without your assistance.\"    \"Very good,\" returned the dragon, cheerfully. \"That will save me a lot  of bother--if you succeed. But I think I shall file my claws, just the  same.\"    He gave a long sigh, as he said this, and a sheet of flame, several  feet in length, shot from his mouth. Betsy shuddered and Hank said  \"Hee-haw!\" while some of the officers screamed in terror. But the  dragon did not notice that he had done anything unusual.    \"Is there fire inside of you?\" asked Shaggy.    \"Of course,\" answered Quox. \"What sort of a dragon would I be if my  fire went out?\"    \"What keeps it going?\" Betsy inquired.    \"I've no idea. I only know it's there,\" said Quox. \"The fire keeps me  alive and enables me to move; also to think and speak.\"    \"Ah! You are ver-y much like my-self,\" said Tik-Tok. \"The on-ly  dif-fer-ence is that I move by clock-work, while you move by fire.\"    \"I don't see a particle of likeness between us, I must confess,\"  retorted Quox, gruffly. \"You are not a live thing; you're a dummy.\"    \"But I can do things, you must ad-mit,\" said Tik-Tok.    \"Yes, when you are wound up,\" sneered the dragon. \"But if you run down,  you are helpless.\"    \"What would happen to you, Quox, if you ran out of gasoline?\" inquired  Shaggy, who did not like this attack upon his friend.    \"I don't use gasoline.\"    \"Well, suppose you ran out of fire.\"    \"What's the use of supposing that?\" asked Quox.  \"My  great-great-great-grandfather has lived since the world began, and he  has never once run out of fire to keep him going. But I will confide to  you that as he gets older he shows more smoke and less fire. As for  Tik-Tok, he's well enough in his way, but he's merely copper. And the  Metal Monarch knows copper through and through. I wouldn't be surprised  if Ruggedo melted Tik-Tok in one of his furnaces and made copper  pennies of him.\"    \"In that case, I would still keep going,\" remarked Tik-Tok, calmly.    \"Pennies do,\" said Betsy regretfully.    \"This is all nonsense,\" said the Queen, with irritation. \"Tik-Tok is my  great Army--all but the officers--and I believe he will be able to  conquer Ruggedo with ease. What do you think, Polychrome?\"    \"You might let him try,\" answered the Rainbow's Daughter, with her  sweet ringing laugh, that sounded like the tinkling of tiny bells. \"And  if Tik-Tok fails, you have still the big fire-breathing dragon to fall  back on.\"    \"Ah!\" said the dragon, another sheet of flame gushing from his mouth  and nostrils; \"it's a wise little girl, this Polychrome. Anyone would  know she is a fairy.\"          Chapter Fourteen    The Long-Eared Hearer Learns by Listening      During this time Ruggedo, the Metal Monarch and King of the Nomes, was  trying to amuse himself in his splendid jeweled cavern. It was hard  work for Ruggedo to find amusement to-day, for all the nomes were  behaving well and there was no one to scold or to punish. The King had  thrown his sceptre at Kaliko six times, without hitting him once. Not  that Kaliko had done anything wrong. On the contrary, he had obeyed the  King in every way but one: he would not stand still, when commanded to  do so, and let the heavy sceptre strike him.    We can hardly blame Kaliko for this, and even the cruel Ruggedo forgave  him; for he knew very well that if he mashed his Royal Chamberlain he  could never find another so intelligent and obedient. Kaliko could make  the nomes work when their King could not, for the nomes hated Ruggedo  and there were so many thousands of the quaint little underground  people that they could easily have rebelled and defied the King had  they dared to do so. Sometimes, when Ruggedo abused them worse than  usual, they grew sullen and threw down their hammers and picks. Then,  however hard the King scolded or whipped them, they would not work  until Kaliko came and begged them to. For Kaliko was one of themselves  and was as much abused by the King as any nome in the vast series of  caverns.    But to-day all the little people were working industriously at their  tasks and Ruggedo, having nothing to do, was greatly bored. He sent for  the Long-Eared Hearer and asked him to listen carefully and report what  was going on in the big world.    \"It seems,\" said the Hearer, after listening for awhile, \"that the  women in America have clubs.\"    \"Are there spikes in them?\" asked Ruggedo, yawning.    \"I cannot hear any spikes, Your Majesty,\" was the reply.    \"Then their clubs are not as good as my sceptre. What else do you hear?'    \"There's a war.    \"Bah! there's always a war. What else?\"    For a time the Hearer was silent, bending forward and spreading out his  big ears to catch the slightest sound. Then suddenly he said:    \"Here is an interesting thing, Your Majesty. These people are arguing  as to who shall conquer the Metal Monarch, seize his treasure and drive  him from his dominions.\"    \"What people?\" demanded Ruggedo, sitting up straight in his throne.    \"The ones you threw down the Hollow Tube.\"    \"Where are they now?\"    \"In the same Tube, and coming back this way,\" said the Hearer.    Ruggedo got out of his throne and began to pace up and down the cavern.    \"I wonder what can be done to stop them,\" he mused.    \"Well,\" said the Hearer, \"if you could turn the Tube upside down, they  would be falling the other way, Your Majesty.\"    Ruggedo glared at him wickedly, for it was impossible to turn the Tube  upside down and he believed the Hearer was slyly poking fun at him.  Presently he asked:    \"How far away are those people now?\"    \"About nine thousand three hundred and six miles, seventeen furlongs,  eight feet and four inches--as nearly as I can judge from the sound of  their voices,\" replied the Hearer.    \"Aha! Then it will be some time before they arrive,\" said Ruggedo, \"and  when they get here I shall be ready to receive them.\"    He rushed to his gong and pounded upon it so fiercely that Kaliko came  bounding into the cavern with one shoe off and one shoe on, for he was  just dressing himself after a swim in the hot bubbling lake of the  Underground Kingdom.    \"Kaliko, those invaders whom we threw down the Tube are coming back  again!\" he exclaimed.    \"I thought they would,\" said the Royal Chamberlain, pulling on the  other shoe. \"Tititi-Hoochoo would not allow them to remain in his  kingdom, of course, and so I've been expecting them back for some time.  That was a very foolish action of yours, Rug.\"    \"What, to throw them down the Tube?\"    \"Yes. Tititi-Hoochoo has forbidden us to throw even rubbish into the  Tube.\"    \"Pooh! what do I care for the Jinjin?\" asked Ruggedo scornfully. \"He  never leaves his own kingdom, which is on the other side of the world.\"    \"True; but he might send some one through the Tube to punish you,\"  suggested Kaliko.    \"I'd like to see him do it! Who could conquer my thousands of nomes?\"    \"Wh"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#15)"],[1," all.    Blinkie approached the bed and with her one eye anxiously stared at the  sleeping stranger.    \"Ah,\" she said in a soft whisper, \"I believe you are right, King Krewl.  The man looks to me like a very powerful wizard. But by good luck I  have caught him asleep, so I shall transform him before he wakes up,  giving him such a form that he will be unable to oppose me.\"    \"Careful!\" cautioned the King, also speaking low. \"If he discovers what  you are doing he may destroy you, and that would annoy me because I  need you to attend to Gloria.\"    But the Wicked Witch realized as well as he did that she must be  careful. She carried over her arm a black bag, from which she now drew  several packets carefully wrapped in paper. Three of these she  selected, replacing the others in the bag. Two of the packets she mixed  together, and then she cautiously opened the third.    \"Better stand back, your Majesty,\" she advised, \"for if this powder  falls on you you might be transformed yourself.\"    The King hastily retreated to the end of the room. As Blinkie mixed the  third powder with the others she waved her hands over it, mumbled a few  words, and then backed away as quickly as she could.    Cap'n Bill was slumbering peacefully, all unconscious of what was going  on. Puff! A great cloud of smoke rolled over the bed and completely hid  him from view. When the smoke rolled away, both Blinkie and the King  saw that the body of the stranger had quite disappeared, while in his  place, crouching in the middle of the bed, was a little gray  grasshopper.    One curious thing about this grasshopper was that the last joint of its  left leg was made of wood. Another curious thing--considering it was a  grasshopper--was that it began talking, crying out in a tiny but sharp  voice:    \"Here--you people! What do you mean by treating me so? Put me back  where I belong, at once, or you'll be sorry!\"    The cruel King turned pale at hearing the grasshopper's threats, but  the Wicked Witch merely laughed in derision. Then she raised her stick  and aimed a vicious blow at the grasshopper, but before the stick  struck the bed the tiny hopper made a marvelous jump--marvelous,  indeed, when we consider that it had a wooden leg. It rose in the air  and sailed across the room and passed right through the open window,  where it disappeared from their view.    \"Good!\" shouted the King. \"We are well rid of this desperate wizard.\"  And then they both laughed heartily at the success of the incantation,  and went away to complete their horrid plans.    After Trot had visited a time with Princess Gloria, the little girl  went to Button-Bright's room but did not find him there. Then she went  to Cap'n Bill's room, but he was not there because the witch and the  King had been there before her. So she made her way downstairs and  questioned the servants. They said they had seen the little boy go out  into the garden, some time ago, but the old man with the wooden leg  they had not seen at all.    Therefore Trot, not knowing what else to do, rambled through the great  gardens, seeking for Button-Bright or Cap'n Bill and not finding either  of them. This part of the garden, which lay before the castle, was not  walled in, but extended to the roadway, and the paths were open to the  edge of the forest; so, after two hours of vain search for her friends,  the little girl returned to the castle.    But at the doorway a soldier stopped her.    \"I live here,\" said Trot, \"so it's all right to let me in. The King has  given me a room.\"    \"Well, he has taken it back again,\" was the soldier's reply. \"His  Majesty's orders are to turn you away if you attempt to enter. I am  also ordered to forbid the boy, your companion, to again enter the  King's castle.\"    \"How 'bout Cap'n Bill?\" she inquired.    \"Why, it seems he has mysteriously disappeared,\" replied the soldier,  shaking his head ominously. \"Where he has gone to, I can't make out,  but I can assure you he is no longer in this castle. I'm sorry, little  girl, to disappoint you. Don't blame me; I must obey my master's  orders.\"    Now, all her life Trot had been accustomed to depend on Cap'n Bill, so  when this good friend was suddenly taken from her she felt very  miserable and forlorn indeed. She was brave enough not to cry before  the soldier, or even to let him see her grief and anxiety, but after  she was turned away from the castle she sought a quiet bench in the  garden and for a time sobbed as if her heart would break.    It was Button-Bright who found her, at last, just as the sun had set  and the shades of evening were falling. He also had been turned away  from the King's castle, when he tried to enter it, and in the park he  came across Trot.    \"Never mind,\" said the boy. \"We can find a place to sleep.\"    \"I want Cap'n Bill,\" wailed the girl.    \"Well, so do I,\" was the reply. \"But we haven't got him. Where do you  s'pose he is, Trot?    \"I don't s'pose anything. He's gone, an' that's all I know 'bout it.\"    Button-Bright sat on the bench beside her and thrust his hands in the  pockets of his knickerbockers. Then he reflected somewhat gravely for  him.    \"Cap'n Bill isn't around here,\" he said, letting his eyes wander over  the dim garden, \"so we must go somewhere else if we want to find him.  Besides, it's fast getting dark, and if we want to find a place to  sleep we must get busy while we can see where to go.\"    He rose from the bench as he said this and Trot also jumped up, drying  her eyes on her apron. Then she walked beside him out of the grounds of  the King's castle. They did not go by the main path, but passed through  an opening in a hedge and found themselves in a small but well-worn  roadway. Following this for some distance, along a winding way, they  came upon no house or building that would afford them refuge for the  night. It became so dark that they could scarcely see their way, and  finally Trot stopped and suggested that they camp under a tree.    \"All right,\" said Button-Bright, \"I've often found that leaves make a  good warm blanket. But--look there, Trot!--isn't that a light flashing  over yonder?\"    \"It certainly is, Button-Bright. Let's go over and see if it's a house.  Whoever lives there couldn't treat us worse than the King did.\"    To reach the light they had to leave the road, so they stumbled over  hillocks and brushwood, hand in hand, keeping the tiny speck of light  always in sight.    They were rather forlorn little waifs, outcasts in a strange country  and forsaken by their only friend and guardian, Cap'n Bill. So they  were very glad when finally they reached a small cottage and, looking  in through its one window, saw Pon, the gardener's boy, sitting by a  fire of twigs.    As Trot opened the door and walked boldly in, Pon sprang up to greet  them. They told him of Cap'n Bill's disappearance and how they had been  turned out of the King's castle. As they finished the story Pon shook  his head sadly.    \"King Krewl is plotting mischief, I fear,\" said he, \"for to-day he sent  for old Blinkie, the Wicked Witch, and with my own eyes I saw her come  from the castle and hobble away toward her hut. She had been with the  King and Googly-Goo, and I was afraid they were going to work some  enchantment on Gloria so she would no longer love me. But perhaps the  witch was only called to the castle to enchant your friend, Cap'n Bill.\"    \"Could she do that?\" asked Trot, horrified by the suggestion.    \"I suppose so, for old Blinkie can do a lot of wicked magical things.\"    \"What sort of an enchantment could she put on Cap'n Bill?\"    \"I don't know. But he has disappeared, so I'm pretty certain she has  done something dreadful to him. But don't worry. If it has happened, it  can't be helped, and if it hasn't happened we may be able to find him  in the morning.\"    With this Pon went to the cupboard and brought food for them. Trot was  far too worried to eat, but Button-Bright made a good supper from the  simple food and then lay down before the fire and went to sleep. The  little girl and the gardener's boy, however, sat for a long time  staring into the fire, busy with their thoughts. But at last Trot, too,  became sleepy and Pon gently covered her with the one blanket he  possessed. Then he threw more wood on the fire and laid himself down  before it, next to Button-Bright. Soon all three were fast asleep. They  were in a good deal of trouble; but they were young, and sleep was good  to them because for a time it made them forget.
