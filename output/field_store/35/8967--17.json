Reuben's rooms have been searched  by the police, who failed to find any skeleton or duplicate keys; but  this proves nothing, as he would probably have made away with them when  he heard of the thumb-mark being found. As to the other matter, I have  asked Reuben, and he has no recollection of ever having made a  thumb-mark in blood. So there the matter rests.\"    \"And what about Mr. Hornby's liability for the diamonds?\"    \"I think we may dismiss that,\" answered Thorndyke. \"He had undertaken no  liability and there was no negligence. He would not be liable at law.\"    After my colleague retired, which he did quite early, I sat for a long  time pondering upon this singular case in which I found myself involved.  And the more I thought about it the more puzzled I became. If Thorndyke  had no more satisfactory explanation to offer than that which he had  given me this evening, the defence was hopeless, for the court was not  likely to accept his estimate of the evidential value of finger-prints.  Yet he had given Reuben something like a positive assurance that there  would be an adequate defence, and had expressed his own positive  conviction of the accused man's innocence. But Thorndyke was not a man  to reach such a conviction through merely sentimental considerations.  The inevitable conclusion was that he had something up his sleeve--that  he had gained possession of some facts that had escaped my observation;  and when I had reached this point I knocked out my pipe and betook  myself to bed.          CHAPTER IX    THE PRISONER      On the following morning, as I emerged from my room, I met Polton coming  up with a tray (our bedrooms were on the attic floor above the  laboratory and workshop), and I accordingly followed him into my  friend's chamber.    \"I shan't go out to-day,\" said Thorndyke, \"though I shall come down  presently. It is very inconvenient, but one must accept the inevitable.  I have had a knock on the head, and, although I feel none the worse, I  must take the proper precautions--rest and a low diet--until I see that  no results are going to follow. You can attend to the scalp wound and  send round the necessary letters, can't you?\"    I expressed my willingness to do all that was required and applauded my  friend's self-control and good sense; indeed, I could not help  contrasting the conduct of this busy, indefatigable man, cheerfully  resigning himself to most distasteful inaction, with the fussy behaviour  of the ordinary patient who, with nothing of importance to do, can  hardly be prevailed upon to rest, no matter how urgent the necessity.  Accordingly, I breakfasted alone, and spent the morning in writing and  despatching letters to the various persons who were expecting visits  from my colleague.    Shortly after lunch (a very spare one, by the way, for Polton appeared  to include me in the scheme of reduced diet) my expectant ear caught  the tinkle of a hansom approaching down Crown Office Row.    \"Here comes your fair companion,\" said Thorndyke, whom I had acquainted  with my arrangements, \"Tell Hornby, from me, to keep up his courage,  and, for yourself, bear my warning in mind. I should be sorry indeed if  you ever had cause to regret that you had rendered me the very valuable  services for which I am now indebted to you. Good-bye; don't keep her  waiting.\"    I ran down the stairs and came out of the entry just as the cabman had  pulled up and flung open the doors.    \"Holloway Prison--main entrance,\" I said, as I stepped up on to the  footboard.    \"There ain't no back door there, sir,\" the man responded, with a grin;  and I was glad that neither the answer nor the grin was conveyed to my  fellow-passenger.    \"You are very punctual, Miss Gibson,\" I said. \"It is not half-past one  yet.\"    \"Yes; I thought I should like to get there by two, so as to have as long  a time with him as is possible without shortening your interview.\"    I looked at my companion critically. She was dressed with rather more  than her usual care, and looked, in fact, a very fine lady indeed. This  circumstance, which I noted at first with surprise and then with decided  approbation, caused me some inward discomfort, for I had in my mind a  very distinct and highly disagreeable picture of the visiting  arrangements at a local prison in one of the provinces, at which I had  acted temporarily as medical officer.    \"I suppose,\" I said at length, \"it is of no use for me to re-open the  question of the advisability of this visit on your part?\"    \"Not the least,\" she replied resolutely, \"though I understand and  appreciate your motive in wishing to do so.\"    \"Then,\" said I, \"if you are really decided, it will be as well for me to  prepare you for the ordeal. I am afraid it will give you a terrible  shock.\"    \"Indeed?\" said she. \"Is it so bad? Tell me what it will be like.\"    \"In the first place,\" I replied, \"you must keep in your mind the purpose  of a prison like Holloway. We are going to see an innocent man--a  cultivated and honourable gentleman. But the ordinary inmates of  Holloway are not innocent men; for the most part, the remand cases on  the male side are professional criminals, while the women are either  petty offenders or chronic inebriates. Most of them are regular  customers at the prison--such is the idiotic state of the law--who come  into the reception-room like travellers entering a familiar hostelry,  address the prison officers by name and demand the usual privileges and  extra comforts--the 'drunks,' for instance, generally ask for a dose of  bromide to steady their nerves and a light in the cell to keep away the  horrors. And such being the character of the inmates, their friends who  visit them are naturally of the same type--the lowest outpourings of the  slums; and it is not surprising to find that the arrangements of the  prison are made to fit its ordinary inmates. The innocent man is a  negligible quantity, and no arrangements are made for him or his  visitors.\"    \"But shall we not be taken to Reuben's cell?\" asked Miss Gibson.    \"Bless you! no,\" I answered; and, determined to give her every  inducement to change her mind, I continued: \"I will describe the  procedure as I have seen it--and a very dreadful and shocking sight I  found it, I can tell you. It was while I was acting as a prison doctor  in the Midlands that I had this experience. I was going my round one  morning when, passing along a passage, I became aware of a strange,  muffled roar from the other side of the wall.    \"'What is that noise?' I asked the warder who was with me.    \"'Prisoners seeing their friends,' he answered. 'Like to have a look at  them, sir?'    \"He unlocked a small door and, as he threw it open, the distant, muffled  sound swelled into a deafening roar. I passed through the door and found  myself in a narrow alley at one end of which a warder was sitting. The  sides of the alley were formed by two immense cages with stout wire  bars, one for the prisoners and the other for the visitors; and each  cage was lined with faces and hands, all in incessant movement, the  faces mouthing and grimacing, and the hands clawing restlessly at the  bars. The uproar was so terrific that no single voice could be  distinguished, though every one present was shouting his loudest to make  himself heard above the universal din. The result was a very strange and  horrid illusion, for it seemed as if no one was speaking at all, but  that the noise came from outside, and that each one of the faces--low,  vicious faces, mostly--was silently grimacing and gibbering, snapping  its jaws and glaring furiously at the occupants of the opposite cage. It  was a frightful spectacle. I could think of nothing but the  monkey-house at the Zoo. It seemed as if one ought to walk up the alley  and offer nuts and pieces of paper to be torn to pieces.\"    \"Horrible!\" exclaimed Miss Gibson. \"And do you mean to say that we shall  be turned loose into one of these cages with a herd of other visitors?\"    \"No. You are not turned loose anywhere in a prison. The arrangement is  this: each cage is divided by partitions into a number of small boxes or  apartments, which are numbered. The prisoner is locked in one box and  his visitor in the corresponding box opposite. They are thus confronted,  with the width of the alley between them; they can see one another and  talk but cannot pass any forbidden articles across--a very necessary  precaution, I need hardly say.\"    \"Yes, I suppose it is necessary, but it is horrible for decent people.  Surely they ought to be able to discriminate.\"    \"Why not give it up and let me take a message to Reuben? He would  understand and be thankful to me for dissuading you.\"    \"No, no,\" she said quickly; \"the more repulsive it is the greater the  necessity for me to go. He must not be allowed to think that a trifling  inconvenience or indignity is enough to scare his friends away. What  building is that ahead?\"    We had just swung round from Caledonian Road into a quiet and  prosperous-looking suburban street, at the end of which rose the tower  of a castellated building.    \"That is the prison,\" I replied. \"We are looking at it from the most  advantageous point of view; seen from the back, and especially from the  inside, it is a good deal less attractive.\"  Nothing more was said  until the cab drove into the courtyard and set us down outside the great  front gates. Having directed the cabman to wait for us, I rang the bell  and we were speedily admitted through a wicket (which was immediately  closed and locked) into a covered court closed in by a second gate,  through the bars of which we could see across an inner courtyard to the  actual entrance to the prison. Here, while the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11153"],[0,"No Hero (#16)"],[1,"just six-and-twenty now.\"    It was a surprise to me. I did not doubt it for a moment; one never did  doubt Mrs. Lascelles. It was indeed easy enough to believe (so much I  told her) if one looked upon the woman as she was, and only difficult in  the prejudicial light of her matrimonial record. I did not add these  things. \"But you are a good deal older,\" I could not help saying, \"in  the ways of the world, and it is there that Bob is such an absolute  infant.\"    \"But I thought an Eton boy was a man of the world?\" said Mrs. Lascelles,  quoting me against myself with the utmost readiness.    \"Ah, in some things,\" I had to concede. \"Only in some things, however.\"    \"Well,\" she rejoined, \"of course I know what you mean by the other  things. They matter to your mind much more than mere age, even if I had  been fifteen years older, instead of five or six. It's the old story,  from the man's point of view. You can live anything down, but you won't  let us. There is no fresh start for a woman; there never was and never  will be.\"    I protested that this was unfair. \"I never said that, or anything like  it, Mrs. Lascellcs!\"    \"No, you don't say it, but you think it!\" she cried back. \"It is the one  thing you have in your mind. I was unhappy, I did wrong, so I can never  be happy, I can never do right! I am unfit to marry again, to marry a  good man, even if he loves me, even if I love him!\"    \"I neither say nor think anything of the kind,\" I reiterated, and with  some slight effect this time. Mrs. Lascelles put no more absurdities  into my mouth.    \"Then what do you say?\" she demanded, her deep voice vibrant with  scornful indignation, though there were tears in it too.    \"I think he will be a lucky fellow who gets you,\" I said, and meant  every word, as I looked at her well in the moonlight, with her shining  eyes, and curling lip, and fighting flush.    \"Thank you, Captain Clephane!\"    And I thought I was to be honoured with a contemptuous courtesy; but I  was not.    \"He ought to be a man, however,\" I went on, \"and not a boy, and still  less the only child of a woman with whom you would never get on.\"    \"So you are as sure of that,\" exclaimed Mrs. Lascelles, \"as of  everything else!\" It seemed, however, to soften her, or at least to  change the current of her thoughts. \"Yet you get on with her?\" she added  with a wistful intonation.    I could not deny that I got on with Catherine Evers.    \"You are even fond of her?\"    \"Quite fond.\"    \"Then do you find me a very disagreeable person, that she and I couldn't  possibly hit it off, in your opinion?\"    \"It isn't that, Mrs. Lascelles,\" said I, almost wearily. \"You must know  what it is. You want to marry her son--\"    Mrs. Lascelles smiled.    \"Well, let us suppose you do. That would be quite enough for Mrs. Evers.  No matter who you were, how peerless, how incomparable in every way, she  would rather die than let you marry him at his age. I don't say she's  wrong--I don't say she's right. I give you the plain fact for what it is  worth: you would find her from the first a clever and determined  adversary, a regular little lioness with her cub, and absolutely  intolerant on that particular point.\"    I could see Catherine as I spoke, the Catherine I had seen last, and  liked least to remember; but the vision faded before the moonlit reality  of Mrs. Lascelles, laughing to herself like a great, naughty, pretty  child.    \"I really think I must marry him,\" she said, \"and see what happens!\"    \"If you do,\" I answered, in all seriousness, \"you will begin by  separating mother and son, and end by making both their lives miserable,  and bringing the last misery into your own.\"    And either my tone impressed her, or the covert reminder in my last  words; for the bold smile faded from her face, and she looked longer and  more searchingly in mine than she had done as yet.    \"You know Mrs. Evers exceedingly well,\" Mrs. Lascelles remarked.    \"I did years ago,\" I guardedly replied.    \"Do you mean to say,\" urged my companion, \"that you have not seen her  for years?\"    I did not altogether like her tone. Yet it was so downright and  straightforward, it was hard to be the very reverse in answer to it, and  I shied idiotically at the honest lie. I had quite lost sight both of  Bob and his mother, I declared, from the day I went to India until now.    \"You mean until you came out here?\" persisted Mrs. Lascelles.    \"Until the other day,\" I said, relying on a carefully affirmative tone  to close the subject. There was a pause. I began to hope I had  succeeded. The flattering tale was never finished.    \"I believe,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, \"that you saw Mrs. Evers in town  before you started.\"    It was too late to lie.    \"As a matter of fact,\" I answered easily, \"I did.\"    I built no hopes on the pause which followed that. Somehow I had my face  to the moon, and Mrs. Lascelles had her back. Yet I knew that her  scrutiny of me was more critical than ever.    \"How funny of Bob never to have told me!\" she said.    \"Told you what?\"    \"That you saw his mother just before you left.\"    \"I didn't tell him,\" I said at length.    \"That was funny of you, Captain Clephane.\"    \"On the contrary,\" I argued, with the impudence which was now my only  chance, \"it was only natural. Bob was rather raw with his friend  Kennerley, you see. You knew about that?\"    \"Oh, yes.\"    \"And why they fell out?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, he might have thought the other fellow had been telling tales,  and that I had come out to have an eye on him, if he had known that I  happened to see his mother just before I started.\"    There was another pause; but now I was committed to an attitude, and  prepared for the worst.    \"Perhaps there would have been some truth in it?\" suggested Mrs.  Lascelles.    \"Perhaps,\" I agreed, \"a little.\"    The pause now was the longest of all. It had no terrors for me. Another  cloud had come between us and the moon. I was sorry for that. I felt  that I was missing something. Even the fine upstanding figure before me  was no longer sharp enough to be expressive.    \"I have been harking back,\" explained Mrs. Lascelles, eventually. \"Now I  begin to follow. You saw his mother, you heard a report, and you  volunteered or at least consented to come out and keep an eye on the  dear boy, as you say yourself. Am I not more or less right so far,  Captain Clephane?\"    Her tone was frozen honey.    \"More or less,\" I admitted ironically.    \"Of course, I don't know what report that other miserable young man may  have carried home with him. I don't want to know. But I can guess. One  does not stay in hotel after hotel without getting a pretty shrewd idea  of the way people talk about one. I know the sort of things they have  been saying here. You would hear them yourself, no doubt, Captain  Clephane, as soon as you arrived.\"    I admitted that I had, but reminded Mrs. Lascelles that the first person  I had spoken to was also the greatest gossip in the hotel. She paid no  attention to the remark, but stood looking at me again, with the look  that I could never quite see to read.    \"And then,\" she went on, \"you found out who it was, and you remembered  all about me, and your worst fears were confirmed. That must have been  an interesting moment. I wonder how you felt.... Did it never occur to  you to speak plainly to anybody?\"    \"I wasn't going to give you away,\" I said, stolidly, though with no  conscious parade of virtue.    \"Yet, you see, it would have made no difference if you had! Did you  seriously think it would make much difference, Captain Clephane, to a  really chivalrous young man?\" I bowed my head to the well-earned taunt.  \"But,\" she went on, \"there was no need for you to speak to Mr. Evers.  You might have spoken to me. Why did you not do that?\"    \"Because I didn't want to quarrel with you,\" I answered quite honestly;  \"because I enjoyed your society too much myself.\"    \"That was very nice of you,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, with a sudden although  subtle return of the good-nature which had always attracted me. \"If it  is sincere,\" she added, as an apparent afterthought.    \"I am perfectly sincere now.\"    \"Then what do you think I should do?\" she asked me, in the soft new tone  which actually flattered me with the idea that she was making up her  mind to take my advice.    \"Refuse this lad!\"    \"And then?\" she almost whispered.    \"And then--\"    I hesitated. I found it hard to say what I thought, hard even upon  myself. We had been good friends. I admired the woman cordially; her  society was pleasant to me, as it always had been. Nevertheless, we had  just engaged in a duel of no friendly character; and now that we seemed  of a sudden to have become friends again, it was the harder to give her  the only advice which I considered compatible alike with my duty and the  varied demands of the situation. If she took it as she seemed disposed  to do, the immediate loss would be mine, and I foresaw besides a much  more disagreeable reckoning with Bob Evers than the one now approaching  an amicable conclusion. I should have to stay behind to face the music  of his wrath alone. Still, at the risk of appearing brutal I made my  proposal in plain terms; but, to minimise that risk, I ventured to take  the lady's hand and was glad to find the familiarity permitted in the  same friendly spirit in which it was indulged.    \"I would have no 'and then,'\" I said, \"if I were you. I should refuse  him under such circumstances that he couldn't possibly bother you, or  himself about you, again. Now is your opportunity.\"    \"Is it?\" she asked, a thrilling timbre in her low voice. And I fancied  there was a kindred tremor in the firm warm hand within mine.    \"The best of opportunities,\" I replied, \"if you are not too wedded to  this place, and can tear yourself away from the rest of us.\" (Her hand  lay loose in mine.) \"Mrs. Lascelles, I should go to-morrow morning\" (her  hand fell away altogether),"]]]
