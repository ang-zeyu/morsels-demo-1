Herbert had purchased the tickets and was turning away, when to his  surprise he saw Ebenezer Graham enter the depot, laboring evidently  under considerable excitement. He did not see Herbert, so occupied  was he with thoughts of an unpleasant nature, till the boy greeted him  respectfully.    \"Herbert Carr!\" he said; \"when did you come into Boston?\"    \"This morning, sir.\"    \"Have you seen anything of my son, Eben, here?\" gasped Mr. Graham.    \"Yes, sir; he was on the same train, but I did not see him to speak to  him till after I reached the city.\"    \"Do you know what he has been doing here?\" asked Ebenezer, his face  haggard with anxiety.    \"I only saw him for five minutes,\" answered Herbert, reluctant to tell  the father what he knew would confirm any suspicion he might entertain.    \"Where did you see him?\" demanded Ebenezer, quickly.    \"At a railroad ticket office not far from the Old South Church.\"    \"Do you know if he bought any ticket?\" asked Ebenezer, anxiously.    \"Yes,\" answered Herbert. \"I overheard him purchasing a ticket to  Chicago.\"    Ebenezer groaned, and his face seemed more and more wizened and puckered  up.    \"It is as I thought!\" he exclaimed, bitterly. \"My own son has robbed me  and fled like a thief, as he is.\"    Herbert was shocked, but not surprised. He didn't like to ask  particulars, but Ebenezer volunteered them.    \"This morning,\" he said, \"I foolishly gave Eben a hundred dollars, and  sent him to Boston to pay for a bill of goods which I recently bought of  a wholesale house on Milk Street. If I had only known you were going in,  I would have sent it by you.\"    Herbert felt gratified at this manifestation of confidence, especially  as he had so recently been charged with robbing the post office, but did  not interrupt Mr. Graham, who continued:    \"As soon as Eben was fairly gone, I began to feel sorry I sent him, for  he got into extravagant ways when he was in Boston before, and he had  been teasing me to give him money enough to go out West with. About  noon I discovered that he had taken fifty dollars more than the amount  I intrusted to him, and then I couldn't rest till I was on my way to  Boston to find out the worst. I went to the house on Milk Street and  found they had seen nothing of Eben. Then I knew what had happened. The  graceless boy has robbed his father of a hundred and fifty dollars, and  is probably on his way West by this time.\"    \"He was to start by the three o'clock train, I think,\" said Herbert, and  gave his reasons for thinking so.    Ebenezer seemed so utterly cast down by this confirmation of his worst  suspicions, that Herbert called Mr. Melville, thinking he might be able  to say something to comfort him.          CHAPTER XIX. EBENEZER GRAHAM'S GRIEF.        \"How much have you lost by your son, Mr. Graham?\" asked George Melville.    \"Nearly two hundred and fifty dollars,\" groaned Ebenezer, \"counting what  I paid in the city to his creditors, it is terrible, terrible!\" and he  wrung his hands in his bitterness of spirit.    \"I am sorry for you,\" said Melville, \"and still more for him.\"    \"Why should you be sorry for him?\" demanded Ebenezer, sharply. \"He  hasn't lost anything.\"    \"Is it nothing to lose his consciousness of integrity, to leave his home  knowing that he is a thief?\"    \"Little he'll care for that!\" said Mr. Graham, shrugging his shoulders.  \"He's laughing in his sleeve, most likely, at the way he has duped and  cheated me, his father.\"    \"How old is Eben, Mr. Graham?\"    \"He will be twenty in November,\" answered Ebenezer, apparently puzzled  by the question.    \"Then, as he is so young, let us hope that he may see the error of his  ways, and repent.\"    \"That won't bring me back my money,\" objected Ebenezer, querulously.  It was clear that he thought more of the money he had lost than of his  son's lack of principle.    \"No, it will not give you back your money, but it may give you back a  son purified and prepared to take an honorable position in society.\"    \"No, no; he's bad, bad!\" said the stricken father. \"What did he care for  the labor and toil it took to save up that money?\"    \"I hope the loss of the money will not distress you, Mr. Graham.\"    \"Well, no, not exactly,\" said Ebenezer, hesitating. \"I shall have to  take some money from the savings bank to make up what that graceless boy  has stolen.\"    It was clear that Ebenezer Graham would not have to go to the poorhouse  in consequence of his losses.    \"I can hardly offer you consolation,\" said George Melville, \"but I  suspect that you will not be called upon to pay any more money for your  son.\"    \"I don't mean to!\" said Ebenezer, grimly.    \"Going away as he has done, he will find it necessary to support  himself, and will hardly have courage to send to you for assistance.\"    \"Let him try it!\" said Ebenezer, his eyes snapping.    \"He may, therefore, being thrown upon his own resources, be compelled to  work hard, and that will probably be the best thing that can happen to  him.\"    \"I hope he will! I hope he will!\" said the storekeeper. \"He may find out  after a while that he had an easy time at home, and was better paid  than he will be among strangers. I won't pay any more of his debts. I'll  publish a notice saying that I have given him his time, and won't pay  any more debts of his contracting. He might run into debt enough to ruin  me, between now and the time he becomes of age.\"    George Melville considered that the storekeeper was justified in taking  this step, and said so.    While they were on the train, Ebenezer got measurably reconciled to his  loss, and his busy brain began to calculate how much money he would  save by ceasing to be responsible for Eben's expenses of living and  prospective debts. Without this drawback, he knew he would grow richer  every year. He knew also that notwithstanding the sum it had just cost  him, he would be better off at the end of the year than the beginning,  and to a man of his character this was perhaps the best form of  consolation that he could have.    Suddenly it occurred to Mr. Graham that he should need a clerk in place  of his son.    \"Now that Eben has gone, Herbert,\" he said, \"I am ready to take you  back.\"    This was a surprise, for Herbert had not thought of the effect upon his  own business prospects.    \"I have got a place, thank you, Mr. Graham,\" he said.    \"You don't call trampin' round huntin' and fishin' work, do you?\" said  Ebenezer.    \"It is very agreeable work, sir.\"    \"But it stands to reason that you can't earn much that way. I wouldn't  give you twenty-five cents a week for such doings.\"    \"Are you willing to pay me more than Mr. Melville does?\" asked Herbert,  demurely, smiling to himself.    \"How much does he pay you now?\" asked Ebenezer, cautiously.    \"Six dollars a week.\"    \"Six dollars a week!\" repeated the storekeeper, in incredulous  amazement. \"Sho! you're joking!\"    \"You can ask Mr. Melville, sir.\"    Ebenezer regarded George Melville with an inquiring look.    \"Yes, I pay Herbert six dollars a week,\" said he, smiling.    \"Well, I never!\" ejaculated Ebenezer. \"That's the strangest thing I  ever heard. How in the name of conscience can a boy earn so much money  trampin' round?\"    \"Perhaps it would not be worth as much to anyone else,\" said Melville,  \"but Herbert suits me, and I need cheerful company.\"    \"You ain't goin' to keep him long at that figger, be you, Mr. Melville?\"  asked Mr. Graham, bluntly.    \"I think we shall be together a considerable time, Mr. Graham. If,  however, you should be willing to pay Herbert a larger salary, I might  feel it only just to release him from his engagement to me.\"    \"Me pay more'n six dollars a week!\" gasped Ebenezer. \"I ain't quite  crazy. Why, it would take about all I get from the post office.\"    \"You wouldn't expect me to take less than I can earn elsewhere, Mr.  Graham,\" said Herbert.    \"No-o!\" answered the storekeeper, slowly. He was evidently nonplused by  the absolute necessity of getting another clerk, and his inability to  think of a suitable person.    \"If Tom Tripp was with me, I might work him into the business,\" said  Ebenezer, thoughtfully, \"but he's bound out to a farmer.\"    An inspiration came to Herbert. He knew that his mother would be glad to  earn something, and there was little else to do in Wayneboro.    \"I think,\" he said, \"you might make an arrangement with my mother, to  make up and sort the mail, for a time, at least.\"    \"Why, so I could; I didn't think of that,\" answered Ebenezer, relieved.  \"Do you think she'd come over to-morrow mornin'?\"    \"If she can't, I will,\" said Herbert. \"I don't meet Mr. Melville till  nine o'clock.\"    \"So do! I'll expect you. I guess I'll come over and see your mother this  evenin', and see if I can't come to some arrangement with her.\"    It may be added that Mr. Graham did as proposed, and Mrs. Carr agreed  to render him the assistance he needed for three dollars a week. It  required only her mornings, and a couple of hours at the close of the  afternoon, and she was very glad to convert so much time into money.    \"It makes me feel more independent,\" she said. \"I don't want to  feel that you do all the work, Herbert, and maintain the family  single-handed.\"    The same evening Herbert broached the plan of traveling with Mr.  Melville. As might have been expected, his mother was at first startled,  and disposed to object, but Herbert set before her the advantages, both  to himself and the family, and touched upon the young man's need of a  companion so skillfully and eloquently that she was at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5760"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 1 (#15)"],[1,"veneration of material objects, places, and  things. I might instance the Protestant missionary who, while  deriding the holy places at Jerusalem, considers the \"Cedars of  Lebanon\" sacred things, and sternly forbids travellers to gather  the cones.    The stereotyped African answer to Europeans ridiculing these  institutions, including wizard-spearing and witch-burning is,  \"There may be no magic, though I see there is, among you whites.  But we blacks have known many men who have been bewitched and  died.\" Even in Asia, whenever I spoke contemptuously to a Moslem  of his Jinns, or to a Hindu of his RÃ¡kshasa, the rejoinder  invariably was, \"You white men are by nature so hot that even our  devils fear you.\"    Witchcraft, which has by no means thoroughly disappeared from  Europe, maintains firm hold upon the African brain. The idea is  found amongst Christians, for instance, the \"reduced Indians\" of  the Amazonas River; and it is evidently at the bottom of that  widely spread superstition, the \"evil eye,\" which remains  throughout Southern Europe as strong as it was in the days of  Pliny. As amongst barbarians generally, no misfortune happens, no  accident occurs, no illness nor death can take place without the  agency of wizard or witch. There is nothing more odious than this  crime; it is hostile to God and man, and it must be expiated by  death in the most terrible tortures. Metamorphosis is a common  art amongst Mpongwe magicians: this vulgar materialism, of which  Ovid sang, must not be confounded with the poetical Hindu  metempsychosis or transmigration of souls which explains  empirically certain physiological mysteries. Here the adept  naturally becomes a gorilla or a leopard, as he would be a lion  in South Africa, a hyena in Abyssinia and the Somali country, and  a loup-garou in Brittany.[FN#15]    The poison ordeal is a necessary corollary to witchcraft. The  plant most used by the Oganga (medicine man) is a small red  rooted shrub, not unlike a hazel bush, and called IkÃ¡zyÃ¡ or  IkÃ¡jÃ¡. Mr. Wilson (p. 225) writes \"Nkazya:\" Battel (loc. cit.  334) terms the root \"Imbando,\" a corruption of MbundÃº. M. du  Chaillu (chap. xv.) gives an illustration of the \"Mboundou leaf\"  (half size): Professor John Torrey believes the active principle  to be a vegeto-alkali of the Strychnos group, but the symptoms do  not seem to bear out the conjecture. The Mpongwe told me that the  poison was named either MbundÃº or OlondÃ¡ (nut) werere--perhaps  this was what is popularly called \"a sell.\" MbundÃº is the  decoction of the scraped bark which corresponds with the \"Sassy-  water\" of the northern maritime tribes. The accused, after  drinking the potion, is ordered to step over sticks of the same  plant, which are placed a pace apart. If the man be affected, he  raises his foot like a horse with string-halt, and this convicts  him of the foul crime. Of course there is some antidote, as the  medicine-man himself drinks large draughts of his own stuff: in  Old Calabar River for instance, Mithridates boils the poison-nut;  but Europeans could not, and natives would not, tell me what the  Gaboon \"dodge\" is. According to vulgar Africans, all test-poisons  are sentient and reasoning beings, who search the criminal's  stomach, that is his heart, and who find out the deep hidden sin;  hence the people shout, \"If they are wizards, let it kill them;  if they are innocent, let it go forth!\" Moreover, the detected  murderer is considered a bungler who has fallen into the pit dug  for his brother. Doubtless many innocent lives have been lost by  this superstition. But there is reason in the order, \"Thou shalt  not suffer a witch to live,\" without having recourse to the  supernaturalisms and preternaturalisms, which have unobligingly  disappeared when Science most wants them. Sorcery and poison are  as closely united as the \"Black Nightingales,\" and it evidently  differs little whether I slay a man with my sword or I destroy  him by the slow and certain torture of a mind diseased.    The Mpongwe have also some peculiarities in their notions of  justice. If a man murder another, the criminal is put to death,  not by the nearest of kin, as amongst the Arabs and almost all  wild people, but by the whole community; this already shows an  advanced appreciation of the act and its bearings. The penalty is  either drowning or burning alive: except in the case of a chief  or a very rich man, little or no difference is made between  wilful murder, justifiable homicide, and accidental manslaughter-  -the reason of this, say their jurists, is to make people more  careful. Here, again, we find a sense of the sanctity of life the  reverse of barbarous. Cutting and maiming are punished by the  fine of a slave.    And now briefly to resume the character of the Mpongwe, a nervous  and excitable race of negroes. The men are deficient in courage,  as the women are in chastity, and neither sex has a tincture of  what we call morality. To commercial shrewdness and eagerness  they add exceptional greed of gain and rascality; foreign rum and  tobacco, dress and ornaments, arms and ammunition have been  necessaries to them; they will have them, and, unless they can  supply themselves by licit, they naturally fly to illicit means.  Yet, despite threats of poison and charges of witchcraft, they  have arrived at an inkling of the dogma that \"honesty is the best  policy:\" the East African has never dreamed it in the moments of  his wildest imagination. Pre-eminent liars, they are, curious to  say, often deceived by the falsehoods of others, and they fairly  illustrate the somewhat paradoxical proverb:       \"He who hates truth shall be the dupe of lies.\"    Unblushing mendicants, cunning and calculating, their obstinacy  is remarkable; yet, as we often find the African, they are at the  same time irresolute in the extreme. Their virtues are vivacity,  mental activity, acute observation, sociability, politeness, and  hospitality: the fact that a white man can wander single-handed  through the country shows a kindly nature. The brightest spot in  their character is an abnormal development of adhesiveness,  popularly called affection; it is somewhat tempered by capricious  ruffianism, as in children; yet it entitles them to the gratÃ­tude  of travellers.    The language of the Mpongwe has been fairly studied. T. Edward  Bowdich (\"Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee,\" London,  Murray, 1819) when leaving the West Coast for England, touched at  the Gaboon in a trading vessel, and visited Naango (King George's  Town), on Abaaga Creek, which he places fifty miles up stream. He  first gave (Appendix VI.) a list of the Mpongwe numerals. In 1847  the \"Missionaries of the A. B. C. F. M.\" Gaboon Mission, Western  Africa, printed a \"Grammar of the Mpongwe Language, with  Vocabularies\" (New York,Snowden and Pratt, Vesey Street), perhaps  a little prematurely; it is the first of the four dialects on  this part of the coast reduced to system by the American  Missionaries, especially by the Rev. Mr. Leighton Wilson, the  others being Bakele, Benga, and FÃ¡n.    In 1856, the same gentleman, who had taken the chief part in the  first publication, made an able abstract and a comparison with  the Grebo and Mandenga tongues (\"Western Africa,\" part iv. chap.  iv.). M. du Chaillu further abridged this abridgement in his  Appendix without owning his authority, and in changing the  examples he did all possible damage. In the Transactions of the  Ethnological Society of London (part ii. vol. i. new series), he  also gave an abstract, in which he repeats himself. A  \"vocabulaire de la langue Ponga\" was printed in the \"MÃ©moires de  la SociÃ©tÃ© Ethnologique,\" tome ii., by M. P. H. Delaporte.    The other publications known to me are:--    1. The Book of Proverbs, translated into the Mpongwe language at  the mission of the A. B. C. F. M., Gaboon, West Africa. New York.  American Bible Society, instituted in the year MDCCCXVI. 1859.    2. The Books of Genesis, part of Exodus, Proverbs, and Acts, by  the same, printed at the same place and in the same year.    The missionary explorers of the language, if I may so call them,  at once saw that it belongs to the great South African family  SichwÃ¡nÃ¡, Zulu, KisawahÃ­li, Mbundo (Congoese), Fiote, and others,  whose characteristics are polysyllabism, inflection by systematic  prefixes, and an alliteration, the mystery of whose reciprocal  letters is theoretically explained by a euphony in many cases  unintelligible, like the modes of HindÃº music, to the European  ear.[FN#16] But they naturally fell into the universally accepted  error of asserting \"it has no known affinities to any of the  languages north of the Mountains of the Moon,\" meaning the  equatorial chain which divides the Niger and Nile valleys from  the basin of the Congo.    This branch has its peculiarities. Like Italian--the coquette who  grants her smiles to many, her favours to few--one of the easiest  to understand and to speak a little, it is very difficult to  master. Whilst every native child can thread its way safely  through its intricate, elaborate, and apparently arbitrary  variations, the people comprehend a stranger who blunders over  every sentence. Mr. Wilson thus limits the use of the accent:  \"Whilst the Mandenga (\"A Grammar of the Mandenga Language,\" by  the Rev. R. Maxwell Macbriar, London, John Mason) and the Grebo  (\"Grammar,\" by the Right Rev. John Payne, D.D. 150, Nassau  Street, New York, 1864), distinguish between similar words,  especially monosyllables, by a certain pitch of voice, the  Mpongwe repel accent, and rely solely upon the clear and distinct  vowel sounds.\" But I found the negative past, present, and future  forms of verbs wholly dependent upon a change of accent, or  rather of intonation or voice-pitch, which the stranger's ear,  unless acute, will fail to detect. For instance, Mi Taund  would  mean \"I love;\" Mi taundÃ¡, \"I do not love.\" The"]]]
