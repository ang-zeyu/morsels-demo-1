You don't know me,\" says he, \"because I'm disguised.\"    \"Musha! then,\" says the king, \"who are you?\"    \"I'm Saint Kavin,\" said the saint, blessing himself.    \"Oh, queen of heaven!\" says the king, making the sign of the cross  between his eyes, and falling down on his knees before the saint; \"is  it the great Saint Kavin,\" says he, \"that I've been discoursing all  this time without knowing it,\" says he, \"all as one as if he was a lump  of a _gossoon_?--and so you're a saint?\" says the king.    \"I am,\" says Saint Kavin.    \"By Jabers, I thought I was only talking to a dacent boy,\" says the  king.    \"Well, you know the difference now,\" says the saint. \"I'm Saint Kavin,\"  says he, \"the greatest of all the saints.\"    And so the king had his goose as good as new, to divert him as long as  he lived: and the saint supported him after he came into his property,  as I told you, until the day of his death--and that was soon after; for  the poor goose thought he was catching a trout one Friday; but, my  jewel, it was a mistake he made--and instead of a trout, it was a  thieving horse-eel; and instead of the goose killing a trout for the  king's supper--by dad, the eel killed the king's goose--and small blame  to him; but he didn't ate her, because he darn't ate what Saint Kavin  had laid his blessed hands on.          THE WOOING OF OLWEN    Shortly after the birth of Kilhuch, the son of King Kilyth, his mother  died. Before her death she charged the king that he should not take a  wife again until he saw a briar with two blossoms upon her grave, and  the king sent every morning to see if anything were growing thereon.  After many years the briar appeared, and he took to wife the widow of  King Doged. She foretold to her stepson, Kilhuch, that it was his  destiny to marry a maiden named Olwen, or none other, and he, at his  father's bidding, went to the court of his cousin, King Arthur, to ask  as a boon the hand of the maiden. He rode upon a grey steed with  shell-formed hoofs, having a bridle of linked gold, and a saddle also  of gold. In his hand were two spears of silver, well-tempered, headed  with steel, of an edge to wound the wind and cause blood to flow, and  swifter than the fall of the dew-drop from the blade of reed grass upon  the earth when the dew of June is at its heaviest. A gold-hilted sword  was on his thigh, and the blade was of gold, having inlaid upon it a  cross of the hue of the lightning of heaven. Two brindled,  white-breasted greyhounds, with strong collars of rubies, sported round  him, and his courser cast up four sods with its four hoofs like four  swallows about his head. Upon the steed was a four-cornered cloth of  purple, and an apple of gold was at each corner. Precious gold was upon  the stirrups and shoes, and the blade of grass bent not beneath them,  so light was the courser's tread as he went towards the gate of King  Arthur's palace.    Arthur received him with great ceremony, and asked him to remain at the  palace; but the youth replied that he came not to consume meat and  drink, but to ask a boon of the king.    Then said Arthur, \"Since thou wilt not remain here, chieftain, thou  shalt receive the boon, whatsoever thy tongue may name, as far as the  wind dries and the rain moistens, and the sun revolves, and the sea  encircles, and the earth extends, save only my ships and my mantle, my  sword, my lance, my shield, my dagger, and Guinevere my wife.\"    So Kilhuch craved of him the hand of Olwen, the daughter of Yspathaden  Penkawr, and also asked the favour and aid of all Arthur's court.    Then said Arthur, \"O chieftain, I have never heard of the maiden of  whom thou speakest, nor of her kindred, but I will gladly send  messengers in search of her.\"    And the youth said, \"I will willingly grant from this night to that at  the end of the year to do so.\"    Then Arthur sent messengers to every land within his dominions to seek  for the maiden; and at the end of the year Arthur's messengers returned  without having gained any knowledge or information concerning Olwen  more than on the first day.    Then said Kilhuch, \"Every one has received his boon, and I yet lack  mine. I will depart and bear away thy honour with me.\"    Then said Kay, \"Rash chieftain! dost thou reproach Arthur? Go with us,  and we will not part until thou dost either confess that the maiden  exists not in the world, or until we obtain her.\"    Thereupon Kay rose up.    Kay had this peculiarity, that his breath lasted nine nights and nine  days under water, and he could exist nine nights and nine days without  sleep. A wound from Kay's sword no physician could heal. Very subtle  was Kay. When it pleased him he could render himself as tall as the  highest tree in the forest. And he had another peculiarity--so great  was the heat of his nature, that, when it rained hardest, whatever he  carried remained dry for a handbreadth above and a handbreadth below  his hand; and when his companions were coldest, it was to them as fuel  with which to light their fire.    And Arthur called Bedwyr, who never shrank from any enterprise upon  which Kay was bound. None was equal to him in swiftness throughout this  island except Arthur and Drych Ail Kibthar. And although he was  one-handed, three warriors could not shed blood faster than he on the  field of battle. Another property he had; his lance would produce a  wound equal to those of nine opposing lances.    And Arthur called to Kynthelig the guide. \"Go thou upon this expedition  with the Chieftain.\" For as good a guide was he in a land which he had  never seen as he was in his own.    He called Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, because he knew all tongues.    He called Gwalchmai, the son of Gwyar, because he never returned home  without achieving the adventure of which he went in quest. He was the  best of footmen and the best of knights. He was nephew to Arthur, the  son of his sister, and his cousin.    And Arthur called Menw, the son of Teirgwaeth, in order that if they  went into a savage country, he might cast a charm and an illusion over  them, so that none might see them whilst they could see every one.    They journeyed on till they came to a vast open plain, wherein they saw  a great castle, which was the fairest in the world. But so far away was  it that at night it seemed no nearer, and they scarcely reached it on  the third day. When they came before the castle they beheld a vast  flock of sheep, boundless and without end. They told their errand to  the herdsman, who endeavoured to dissuade them, since none who had come  thither on that quest had returned alive. They gave to him a gold ring,  which he conveyed to his wife, telling her who the visitors were.    On the approach of the latter, she ran out with joy to greet them, and  sought to throw her arms about their necks. But Kay, snatching a billet  out of the pile, placed the log between her two hands, and she squeezed  it so that it became a twisted coil.    \"O woman,\" said Kay, \"if thou hadst squeezed me thus, none could ever  again have set their affections on me. Evil love were this.\"    They entered the house, and after meat she told them that the maiden  Olwen came there every Saturday to wash. They pledged their faith that  they would not harm her, and a message was sent to her. So Olwen came,  clothed in a robe of flame-coloured silk, and with a collar of ruddy  gold, in which were emeralds and rubies, about her neck. More golden  was her hair than the flower of the broom, and her skin was whiter than  the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands and her fingers than  the blossoms of the wood anemone amidst the spray of the meadow  fountain. Brighter were her glances than those of a falcon; her bosom  was more snowy than the breast of the white swan, her cheek redder than  the reddest roses. Whoso beheld was filled with her love. Four white  trefoils sprang up wherever she trod, and therefore was she called  Olwen.    Then Kilhuch, sitting beside her on a bench, told her his love, and she  said that he would win her as his bride if he granted whatever her  father asked.    Accordingly they went up to the castle and laid their request before  him.    \"Raise up the forks beneath my two eyebrows which have fallen over my  eyes,\" said Yspathaden Penkawr, \"that I may see the fashion of my  son-in-law.\"    They did so, and he promised, them an answer on the morrow. But as they  were going forth, Yspathaden seized one of the three poisoned darts  that lay beside him and threw it back after them.    And Bedwyr caught it and flung it back, wounding Yspathaden in the knee.    Then said he, \"A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly. I shall ever walk  the worse for his rudeness. This poisoned iron pains me like the bite  of a gad-fly. Cursed be the smith who forged it, and the anvil whereon  it was wrought.\"    The knights rested in the house of Custennin the herdsman, but the next  day at dawn they returned to the castle and renewed their request.    Yspathaden said it was necessary that he should consult Olwen's four  great-grandmothers and her four great-grand-sires.    The knights again withdrew, and as they were going he took the second  dart and cast it after them.    But Menw caught it and flung it back, piercing Yspathaden's breast with  it, so that it came out at the small of his back.    \"A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly,\" says he, \"the hard iron pains me  like the bite of a horse-leech.

I maintain that this scene represents not so much an assault by  the man of the woods on the Happy Princess as a violent and frantic attack  by an actor on the woman he desires. Certainly it all happened within the  bounds prescribed by the part and nobody saw anything in it--nobody except  perhaps Rose Andree herself--but I, for my part, have detected flashes  of passion which leave not a doubt in my mind. I have seen glances that  betrayed the wish and even the intention to commit murder. I have seen  clenched hands, ready to strangle, in short, a score of details which prove  to me that, at that time, the man's instinct was urging him to kill the  woman who could never be his.\"    \"And it all amounts to what?\"    \"We must protect Rose Andree if she is still in danger and if it is not too  late.\"    \"And to do this?\"    \"We must get hold of further information.\"    \"From whom?\"    \"From the World's Cinema Company, which made the film. I will go to them  to-morrow morning. Will you wait for me in your flat about lunch-time?\"    At heart, Hortense was still sceptical. All these manifestations of  passion, of which she denied neither the ardour nor the ferocity, seemed  to her to be the rational behaviour of a good actor. She had seen nothing  of the terrible tragedy which Renine contended that he had divined; and  she wondered whether he was not erring through an excess of imagination.    \"Well,\" she asked, next day, not without a touch of irony, \"how far have  you got? Have you made a good bag? Anything mysterious? Anything  thrilling?\"    \"Pretty good.\"    \"Oh, really? And your so-called lover....\"    \"Is one Dalbreque, originally a scene-painter, who played the butler in the  first part of the film and the man of the woods in the second and was so  much appreciated that they engaged him for a new film. Consequently, he has  been acting lately. He was acting near Paris. But, on the morning of Friday  the 18th of September, he broke into the garage of the World's Cinema  Company and made off with a magnificent car and forty thousand francs  in money. Information was lodged with the police; and on the Sunday the  car was found a little way outside Dreux. And up to now the enquiry has  revealed two things, which will appear in the papers to-morrow: first,  Dalbreque is alleged to have committed a murder which created a great stir  last year, the murder of Bourguet, the jeweller; secondly, on the day after  his two robberies, Dalbreque was driving through Le Havre in a motor-car  with two men who helped him to carry off, in broad daylight and in a  crowded street, a lady whose identity has not yet been discovered.\"    \"Rose Andree?\" asked Hortense, uneasily.    \"I have just been to Rose Andree's: the World's Cinema Company gave me her  address. Rose Andree spent this summer travelling and then stayed for a  fortnight in the Seine-inferieure, where she has a small place of her own,  the actual cottage in _The Happy Princess_. On receiving an invitation  from America to do a film there, she came back to Paris, registered her  luggage at the Gare Saint-Lazare and left on Friday the 18th of September,  intending to sleep at Le Havre and take Saturday's boat.\"    \"Friday the 18th,\" muttered Hortense, \"the same day on which that man....\"    \"And it was on the Saturday that a woman was carried off by him at  Le Havre. I looked in at the Compagnie Transatlantique and a brief  investigation showed that Rose Andree had booked a cabin but that the  cabin remained unoccupied. The passenger did not turn up.\"    \"This is frightful. She has been carried off. You were right.\"    \"I fear so.\"    \"What have you decided to do?\"    \"Adolphe, my chauffeur, is outside with the car. Let us go to Le Havre. Up  to the present, Rose Andree's disappearance does not seem to have become  known. Before it does and before the police identify the woman carried off  by Dalbreque with the woman who did not turn up to claim her cabin, we will  get on Rose Andree's track.\"    There was not much said on the journey. At four o'clock Hortense and Renine  reached Rouen. But here Renine changed his road.    \"Adolphe, take the left bank of the Seine.\"    He unfolded a motoring-map on his knees and, tracing the route with his  finger, showed Hortense that, if you draw a line from Le Havre, or rather  from Quillebeuf, where the road crosses the Seine, to Dreux, where the  stolen car was found, this line passes through Routot, a market-town lying  west of the forest of Brotonne:    \"Now it was in the forest of Brotonne,\" he continued, \"according to what I  heard, that the second part of _The Happy Princess_ was filmed. And  the question that arises is this: having got hold of Rose Andree, would it  not occur to Dalbreque, when passing near the forest on the Saturday night,  to hide his prey there, while his two accomplices went on to Dreux and from  there returned to Paris? The cave was quite near. Was he not bound to go to  it? How should he do otherwise? Wasn't it while running to this cave, a few  months ago, that he held in his arms, against his breast, within reach of  his lips, the woman whom he loved and whom he has now conquered? By every  rule of fate and logic, the adventure is being repeated all over again ...  but this time in reality. Rose Andree is a captive. There is no hope  of rescue. The forest is vast and lonely. That night, or on one of the  following nights, Rose Andree must surrender ... or die.\"    Hortense gave a shudder:    \"We shall be too late. Besides, you don't suppose that he's keeping her a  prisoner?\"    \"Certainly not. The place I have in mind is at a cross-roads and is not a  safe retreat. But we may discover some clue or other.\"    The shades of night were falling from the tall trees when they entered the  ancient forest of Brotonne, full of Roman remains and mediaeval relics.  Renine knew the forest well and remembered that near a famous oak, known  as the Wine-cask, there was a cave which must be the cave of the Happy  Princess. He found it easily, switched on his electric torch, rummaged in  the dark corners and brought Hortense back to the entrance:    \"There's nothing inside,\" he said, \"but here is the evidence which I was  looking for. Dalbreque was obsessed by the recollection of the film, but so  was Rose Andree. The Happy Princess had broken off the tips of the branches  on the way through the forest. Rose Andree has managed to break off some to  the right of this opening, in the hope that she would be discovered as on  the first occasion.\"    \"Yes,\" said Hortense, \"it's a proof that she has been here; but the proof  is three weeks old. Since that time....\"    \"Since that time, she is either dead and buried under a heap of leaves or  else alive in some hole even lonelier than this.\"    \"If so, where is he?\"    Renine pricked up his ears. Repeated blows of the axe were sounding from  some distance, no doubt coming from a part of the forest that was being  cleared.    \"He?\" said Renine, \"I wonder whether he may not have continued to behave  under the influence of the film and whether the man of the woods in _The  Happy Princess_ has not quite naturally resumed his calling. For how is  the man to live, to obtain his food, without attracting attention? He will  have found a job.\"    \"We can't make sure of that.\"    \"We might, by questioning the woodcutters whom we can hear.\"    The car took them by a forest-road to another cross-roads where they  entered on foot a track which was deeply rutted by waggon-wheels. The sound  of axes ceased. After walking for a quarter of an hour, they met a dozen  men who, having finished work for the day, were returning to the villages  near by.    \"Will this path take us to Routot?\" ask Renine, in order to open a  conversation with them.    \"No, you're turning your backs on it,\" said one of the men, gruffly.    And he went on, accompanied by his mates.    Hortense and Renine stood rooted to the spot. They had recognized the  butler. His cheeks and chin were shaved, but his upper lip was covered by  a black moustache, evidently dyed. The eyebrows no longer met and were  reduced to normal dimensions.           *       *       *       *       *    Thus, in less than twenty hours, acting on the vague hints supplied by the  bearing of a film-actor, Serge Renine had touched the very heart of the  tragedy by means of purely psychological arguments.    \"Rose Andree is alive,\" he said. \"Otherwise Dalbreque would have left the  country. The poor thing must be imprisoned and bound up; and he takes her  some food at night.\"    \"We will save her, won't we?\"    \"Certainly, by keeping a watch on him and, if necessary, but in the last  resort, compelling him by force to give up his secret.\"    They followed the woodcutter at a distance and, on the pretext that the car  needed overhauling, engaged rooms in the principal inn at Routot.    Attached to the inn was a small cafe from which they were separated by the  entrance to the yard and above which were two rooms, reached by a wooden  outer staircase, at one side. Dalbreque occupied one of these rooms and  Renine took the other for his chauffeur.    Next morning he learnt from Adolphe that Dalbreque, on the previous  evening, after all the lights were out, had carried down a bicycle from his  room and mounted it and had not returned until shortly before sunrise.    The bicycle tracks led Renine to the uninhabited Chateau des Landes, five  miles from the village. They disappeared in a rocky path which ran beside  the park down to the Seine, opposite the Jumieges peninsula.    Next night, he took up his position there. At eleven o'clock, Dalbreque  climbed a bank, scrambled "]]]
