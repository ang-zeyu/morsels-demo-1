Two large and ragged boys were crouched amid  the dark shadows of the stairs. They were much larger than Robert and  Cyril, and one of them had snatched the Phoenix away and was holding it  high above their heads.    'Give me that bird,' said Cyril, sternly: 'it's ours.'    'Good arternoon, and thankin' you,' the boy went on, with maddening  mockery. 'Sorry I can't give yer tuppence for yer trouble--but I've  'ad to spend my fortune advertising for my vallyable bird in all the  newspapers. You can call for the reward next year.'    'Look out, Ike,' said his friend, a little anxiously; 'it 'ave a beak on  it.'    'It's other parties as'll have the Beak on to 'em presently,' said Ike,  darkly, 'if they come a-trying to lay claims on my Poll parrot. You just  shut up, Urb. Now then, you four little gells, get out er this.'    'Little girls!' cried Robert. 'I'll little girl you!'    He sprang up three stairs and hit out.    There was a squawk--the most bird-like noise any one had ever heard  from the Phoenix--and a fluttering, and a laugh in the darkness, and Ike  said--    'There now, you've been and gone and strook my Poll parrot right in the  fevvers--strook 'im something crool, you 'ave.'    Robert stamped with fury. Cyril felt himself growing pale with rage,  and with the effort of screwing up his brain to make it clever enough to  think of some way of being even with those boys. Anthea and Jane were as  angry as the boys, but it made them want to cry. Yet it was Anthea who  said--    'Do, PLEASE, let us have the bird.'    'Dew, PLEASE, get along and leave us an' our bird alone.'    'If you don't,' said Anthea, 'I shall fetch the police.'    'You better!' said he who was named Urb. 'Say, Ike, you twist the  bloomin' pigeon's neck; he ain't worth tuppence.'    'Oh, no,' cried Jane, 'don't hurt it. Oh, don't; it is such a pet.'    'I won't hurt it,' said Ike; 'I'm 'shamed of you, Urb, for to think of  such a thing. Arf a shiner, miss, and the bird is yours for life.'    'Half a WHAT?' asked Anthea.    'Arf a shiner, quid, thick 'un--half a sov, then.'    'I haven't got it--and, besides, it's OUR bird,' said Anthea.    'Oh, don't talk to him,' said Cyril and then Jane said suddenly--    'Phoenix--dear Phoenix, we can't do anything. YOU must manage it.'    'With pleasure,' said the Phoenix--and Ike nearly dropped it in his  amazement.    'I say, it do talk, suthin' like,' said he.    'Youths,' said the Phoenix, 'sons of misfortune, hear my words.'    'My eyes!' said Ike.    'Look out, Ike,' said Urb, 'you'll throttle the joker--and I see at  wunst 'e was wuth 'is weight in flimsies.'00    'Hearken, O Eikonoclastes, despiser of sacred images--and thou, Urbanus,  dweller in the sordid city. Forbear this adventure lest a worse thing  befall.'    'Luv' us!' said Ike, 'ain't it been taught its schoolin' just!'    'Restore me to my young acolytes and escape unscathed. Retain me--and--'    'They must ha' got all this up, case the Polly got pinched,' said Ike.  'Lor' lumme, the artfulness of them young uns!'    'I say, slosh 'em in the geseech and get clear off with the swag's wot I  say,' urged Herbert.    'Right O,' said Isaac.    'Forbear,' repeated the Phoenix, sternly. 'Who pinched the click off of  the old bloke in Aldermanbury?' it added, in a changed tone.    'Who sneaked the nose-rag out of the young gell's 'and in Bell Court?  Who--'    'Stow it,' said Ike. 'You! ugh! yah!--leave go of me. Bash him off, Urb;  'e'll have my bloomin' eyes outer my ed.'    There were howls, a scuffle, a flutter; Ike and Urb fled up the stairs,  and the Phoenix swept out through the doorway. The children followed and  the Phoenix settled on Robert, 'like a butterfly on a rose,' as Anthea  said afterwards, and wriggled into the breast of his Norfolk jacket,  'like an eel into mud,' as Cyril later said.    'Why ever didn't you burn him? You could have, couldn't you?' asked  Robert, when the hurried flight through the narrow courts had ended in  the safe wideness of Farringdon Street.    'I could have, of course,' said the bird, 'but I didn't think it would  be dignified to allow myself to get warm about a little thing like that.  The Fates, after all, have not been illiberal to me. I have a good many  friends among the London sparrows, and I have a beak and claws.'    These happenings had somewhat shaken the adventurous temper of the  children, and the Phoenix had to exert its golden self to hearten them  up.    Presently the children came to a great house in Lombard Street, and  there, on each side of the door, was the image of the Phoenix carved in  stone, and set forth on shining brass were the words--         PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE      'One moment,' said the bird. 'Fire? For altars, I suppose?'    '_I_ don't know,' said Robert; he was beginning to feel shy, and that  always made him rather cross.    'Oh, yes, you do,' Cyril contradicted. 'When people's houses are burnt  down the Phoenix gives them new houses. Father told me; I asked him.'    'The house, then, like the Phoenix, rises from its ashes? Well have my  priests dealt with the sons of men!'    'The sons of men pay, you know,' said Anthea; 'but it's only a little  every year.'    'That is to maintain my priests,' said the bird, 'who, in the hour of  affliction, heal sorrows and rebuild houses. Lead on; inquire for the  High Priest. I will not break upon them too suddenly in all my glory.  Noble and honour-deserving are they who make as nought the evil deeds of  the lame-footed and unpleasing Hephaestus.'    'I don't know what you're talking about, and I wish you wouldn't muddle  us with new names. Fire just happens. Nobody does it--not as a deed,  you know,' Cyril explained. 'If they did the Phoenix wouldn't help them,  because its a crime to set fire to things. Arsenic, or something they  call it, because it's as bad as poisoning people. The Phoenix wouldn't  help THEM--father told me it wouldn't.'    'My priests do well,' said the Phoenix. 'Lead on.'    'I don't know what to say,' said Cyril; and the Others said the same.    'Ask for the High Priest,' said the Phoenix. 'Say that you have a  secret to unfold that concerns my worship, and he will lead you to the  innermost sanctuary.'    So the children went in, all four of them, though they didn't like it,  and stood in a large and beautiful hall adorned with Doulton tiles,  like a large and beautiful bath with no water in it, and stately pillars  supporting the roof. An unpleasing representation of the Phoenix in  brown pottery disfigured one wall. There were counters and desks of  mahogany and brass, and clerks bent over the desks and walked behind the  counters. There was a great clock over an inner doorway.    'Inquire for the High Priest,' whispered the Phoenix.    An attentive clerk in decent black, who controlled his mouth but not his  eyebrows, now came towards them. He leaned forward on the counter, and  the children thought he was going to say, 'What can I have the pleasure  of showing you?' like in a draper's; instead of which the young man  said--    'And what do YOU want?'    'We want to see the High Priest.'    'Get along with you,' said the young man.    An elder man, also decent in black coat, advanced.    'Perhaps it's Mr Blank' (not for worlds would I give the name). 'He's a  Masonic High Priest, you know.'    A porter was sent away to look for Mr Asterisk (I cannot give his name),  and the children were left there to look on and be looked on by all  the gentlemen at the mahogany desks. Anthea and Jane thought that they  looked kind. The boys thought they stared, and that it was like their  cheek.    The porter returned with the news that Mr Dot Dash Dot (I dare not  reveal his name) was out, but that Mr--    Here a really delightful gentleman appeared. He had a beard and a kind  and merry eye, and each one of the four knew at once that this was a man  who had kiddies of his own and could understand what you were talking  about. Yet it was a difficult thing to explain.    'What is it?' he asked. 'Mr'--he named the name which I will never  reveal--'is out. Can I do anything?'    'Inner sanctuary,' murmured the Phoenix.    'I beg your pardon,' said the nice gentleman, who thought it was Robert  who had spoken.    'We have something to tell you,' said Cyril, 'but'--he glanced at the  porter, who was lingering much nearer than he need have done--'this is a  very public place.'    The nice gentleman laughed.    'Come upstairs then,' he said, and led the way up a wide and beautiful  staircase. Anthea says the stairs were of white marble, but I am not  sure. On the corner-post of the stairs, at the top, was a beautiful  image of the Phoenix in dark metal, and on the wall at each side was a  flat sort of image of it.    The nice gentleman led them into a room where the chairs, and even the  tables, were covered with reddish leather. He looked at the children  inquiringly.    'Don't be frightened,' he said; 'tell me exactly what you want.'    'May I shut the door?' asked Cyril.    The gentleman looked surprised, but he shut the door.    'Now,' said Cyril, firmly, 'I know you'll be awfully surprised, and  you'll think it's not true and we are lunatics; but we aren't, and it  is. Robert's got something inside his Norfolk--that's Robert, he's my  young brother. Now don't be upset and have a fit or anything sir. Of  course, I know when you called your shop the \"Phoenix\" you never thought  there was one; but there is--and Robert's got it buttoned up against his  chest!'    'If it's an old curio in the form of a Phoenix, I dare say the Board--'  said the nice gentleman, as Robert began to fumble with his buttons.    'It's old enough,' said Anthea, 'going by what it says, but--'    'My goodness gracious!' said the gentleman, as the Phoenix, with one  last wriggle that melted into a flutter, got out of its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8390"],[0,"Buddhism and Buddhists in China (#15)"],[1," the middle and the small merit accumulated? What are  the fruits of these proportions of merit and what are they like? Tell me  how to believe Christ. What work of meditation do you perform? Is not  Buddhism more democratic than Christianity, because it holds out the  possibility of Buddhahood to all beings? Is not Buddhism more inclusive,  because it provides for the salvation of all beings?    _2. Knowledge and Sympathy_    These questions make it plain that the worker who is to deal with  Buddhists should have a broad background of general culture. He must be  thoroughly humanized. He should have a good knowledge of the history of  philosophy and religion, including the work of the modern philosophers.  A knowledge of the life of Buddha and of the doctrines of the Hînayâna  or Southern Buddhism, as well as the tenets of the Mahayâna should be in  his possession. The psychology of religion should interpenetrate his  historical learning; the best methods of pedagogy should guide his  approach to men. Of course he must speak the language of the Buddhist,  not only the spiritual language, but his everyday patois. He will find  it an advantage to know some Sanskrit. While this requirement is not  very urgent at present, it will rapidly become a necessity for doing the  best work.    This knowledge should be interpenetrated by a genuine sympathy, that is,  imagination tinged with emotion. The worker should be able to view  doctrines, values and actions from the point of view of the Buddhist and  his past history. He must have a genuine interest in and a great  capacity for friendship. The Buddhists are very human, responding to  friendship very quickly. Such friendship forms a link between the man  and the larger friendship of Christ.    _3. Emphasis on the Aesthetic in Christianity_    A Chinese Christian leader described his idea of a church as a place  removed from the din of the street, approached by a walk flanked with  trees and flowers and adorned within by symbols speaking to the heart of  the Chinese. He longed for the mystic silence and the beauty of holiness  which would open the windows of the world of spiritual reality and throw  its light upon the problems of life. He was asked, \"Would you adapt some  of the symbols of the Chinese religions?\" He said, \"Many of those  symbols are neutral. They suggest religious emotion. Their character  depends upon the content which the occasion puts into them. If the  content is Christian then the symbols and emotions will become  Christian.\"    Christianity is a religion of beauty. The beautiful in architecture,  symbol and ritual, expressing the spiritual universe of the past,  present and future, makes a strong appeal to the Chinese heart. It may  well be emphasized in the future as never before.    _4. Emphasis on the Mystical in Christianity_    Not long ago a Buddhist in one of the large cities of China was  converted. He found great joy in the experience which revived him and  gathered into unity the broken fragments of his life. He attended church  regularly and participated in the prayer meetings. Gradually he  discovered that he was not being nourished. He felt his joy slipping  away from him and his divided life reinstating itself. He went to  Buddhism for consolation. He is not hostile to the church. He  appreciates the help he received, but he said that he came for  consolation and peace and found the same--hard orthodoxy and morality so  familiar to him in Confucianism.    While the case of this man may have individual peculiarities, it may be  made the starting point for a discussion of the situation in many  churches in China. The early message to the Chinese was doctrinal. The  false notion of many gods had to be displaced by the idea of the one  true God. With this idea of the true God a few other tenets of the  Christian religion are often held as dogmatic propositions to be  repeated when questions are asked. The great sin preached is the worship  of idols.    The second part of the Christian message is salvation by faith in Jesus  Christ. This salvation is other-worldly to a large extent. The extreme  emphasis upon it has made of the church an insurance society, membership  in which insures bliss in the world beyond.    The third part of the message has been concerned with moral acts,  abstinence from opium (liquor and tobacco in some churches), polygamy,  and the gross sins. Attendance upon church services, contribution for  the support of the church, and the refusal to contribute to idolatry  have also been required.    The emphasis to a large extent was doctrinal, moral and individual. The  result has been a body of people free from the gross sins, but also  innocent of the great virtues and individualistic in their outlook upon  this world and the next. This emphasis is needed, but in addition there  should be the cultivation of the presence of God in the soul by  appropriate means. The Christian Church of China should develop a  technique of the spiritual life suited to the East. The formation of  habits of devotion should be emphasized. Intercessory prayer should be  given a larger place. Contemplation and meditation should be regarded  not merely as an escape from the turmoil and strife of the world, but as  a preparation for the highest life of service and sacrifice. Buddhist  mysticism united the whole universe and was the great foundation of  Chinese art, literature and morality. The spiritual world of  Christianity must likewise seep through into the very thought of Asia  and inspire the new art, literature and morality which will be the world  expression of a Christian universe.    _5. Emphasis on the Social Elements in Christianity_    To the aesthetic and mystical emphasis must be attached a social  emphasis. Buddhism is often criticized as not being social. It is a  highly socialized religion. It has had a large influence upon social  life in the East. This social life is different from ours. We see its  wrongs and weaknesses. Likewise do the Buddhists see the materialism and  injustice of our social life. Christianity must relate itself to the  modern world as it is rising in China and seek not merely to remedy a  few wrongs or heal a few diseases, but must release the healing stream  into the social life of the East. This will be done and is being done  through the Church community which has become conscious of itself,  realizing its needs and wants, seeking in an intelligent and systematic  way to rehabilitate itself. It is not so much the external unrelated  efforts that accomplish the thing needed, but it is rather the community  life stirred by ideals and fired by a new dynamic which begins the work  of reformation.    _6. Emphasis on the Person of Jesus Christ_    _(a) As a Historical Character._--The great asset of the missionary  among Buddhists is the historical person of Christ. In contrast to many  of the Bodhisattvas, the saviours of the Buddhists, Jesus is a  historical character. His life among men was the life of God among men.    _(b) As the Revealer._--God is like Christ. Christ reveals God as  the complete, the perfect person. He possessed the pure spiritual  personality. The chief characteristic of this personality is love. This  love conscious of itself finds its highest joy in the well-being of  others. This love of God produced human life which, springing from the  lowest form, broke through the material elements and is capable of  attaining the highest development.    Christ reveals to man his heavenly relationship. Man created in the  likeness of God stands in the highest relation of one person to another  through love. He likens this relation to that of father and son. He  lifts man to the fellowship with the divine. Yet such a fellowship that  man preserves his personality.    Christ reveals man in his relation to men as a brother and the form of  love which shall control the relation of man to God as well as man to  man.    Christ revealed and founded the Kingdom, a society of the saved,  dominated by the spirit of the founder and making this spirit of love  and service the organizing power in the world.    _(c) As the Saviour._--Mahayâna Buddhism emphasized saviourhood.  Christ is the saviour of men. In Buddhism the stress is placed upon the  merit of the saviour and the saved. There is no question that merit has  some value. Yet Christ does not save us by merit, nor do we help to save  one another by merit. Salvation is a moral and spiritual process. It is  concerned with the biology of the soul. The salvation that we preach is  not the salvation by knowledge, or meditation, or merit, but by the  interpenetration of Christ's spirit in ours, by the mystic and moral  union of our life with his. As Paul says: \"That I may know Him and the  power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His suffering.\" Yet He  is not the saviour of the individual alone. He saves the community, the  church. Only as His spirit permeates and dominates the community does he  find his true self and the real salvation.    _(d) As the Eternal Son, of God._--The Mahayâna system does not  emphasize the historicity of Amitabha or of the Bodhisattvas. Spiritual  truth is the development of the soul. It is not limited by time and  place. Likewise Christianity must emphasize the eternal character of  Jesus Christ. \"The Logos existed in the very beginning, the Logos was  with God, the Logos was God.\" To the Mahâyânist this spiritual history  is more real than any fact conditioned by time and place.    The Christian worker must learn to understand the import of the Gospel  of John. He must see in Jesus Christ \"The real Light, which enlightens  every man.\" He must be able to convince himself that the Christ is the  fulfillment of the highest aspirations of the Mahâyâna system.    _7.
