[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6104"],[0,"Station Life in New Zealand (#15)"],[1,"s: great ingenuity was displayed in the arrangement of  lights, and the result was a very pretty ball-room.    We are always eating in this country, so you will not be surprised  to hear that there was yet another meal to be disposed of before we  separated to dress in all sorts of nooks and corners. White muslin was  the universal costume, as it can be packed flat and smooth. My gown  had been carried over by F---- in front of his saddle in a very small  parcel: I covered it almost entirely with sprays of the light-green  stag's-head, moss, and made a wreath of it also for my hair. I think  that with the other ladies roses were the most popular decoration, and  they looked very fresh and nice. I was the universal _coiffeuse_, and I  dressed all the girls' heads with flowers, as I was supposed to be best  up in the latest fashions. In the meantime, the piano had been moved to  the bay-window of the ball-room, and at ten o'clock dancing commenced,  and may be truly said to have been kept up with great spirit until four  o'clock: it only ceased then on account of the state of exhaustion of  the unfortunate five ladies, who had been nearly killed with incessant  dancing. I threw a shawl over my head, and sauntered alone up one of the  many paths close to the house which led into the Bush. Tired as I was,  I shall never forget the beauty and romance of that hour,--the delicious  crisp _new_ feeling of the morning air; the very roses, growing like a  red fringe on the skirts of the great Bush, seemed awaking to fresh life  and perfume; the numbers of gay lizards and flies coming out for their  morning meal, and, above all, the first awakening of the myriads of  Bush-birds; every conceivable twitter and chatter and chirrup; the last  cry of a very pretty little owl, called, from its distinctly uttered  words, the \"More-pork,\" as it flitted away before the dawn to the  highest trees: all made up a jubilant uproar compared to which one of  the Crystal Palace choruses is silence. I sat down on a fallen tree, and  listened and waited: every moment added to the lovely dawn around me,  and I enjoyed to the full the fragrant smells and joyous sounds of  another day in this fresh young land.    All too soon came a loud \"coo-ee\" from the house, which I allowed them  to repeat before I answered; this was to tell me that the ball-room was  deserted, and had been again turned into a bed-room. When I opened my  eyes later, after a six hours' nap, the room looked like a fairy bower,  the flowers still unfaded. We had another picnic the next day up the  gorge of a river, amid very wild and beautiful scenery; but everything  had been arranged so as to make the expedition an easy one, out of  consideration to the weary five. The day after this we rode home again,  and I had to set to work directly to prepare for my own Christmas party  to the shepherds and shearers,--for we have just commenced to muster  the sheep, and the shearing will be in full force by Christmas Day.  One great object I have in view in giving this party is to prevent the  shearers from going over to the nearest accommodation-house and getting  tipsy, as they otherwise would; so I have taken care to issue my  invitations early. I found great difficulty in persuading some of the  men to accept, as they had not brought any tidy clothes with them; and  as the others would be decently, indeed well dressed, they did not like  putting in a shabby appearance. This difficulty was obviated by F----  hunting up some of the things he had worn on the voyage, and rigging-out  the invited guests. For two days before the great day I had been working  hard, studying recipes for pies and puddings, and scouring the country  in search of delicacies. Every lady was most kind, knowing that our  poor, exposed garden was backward; I had sacks of green peas, bushels of  young potatoes, and baskets of strawberries and cherries sent to me from  all round the country; I made poor F---- ride twenty miles to get me a  sirloin of beef, and, to my great joy, two beautiful young geese arrived  as a present only the day before. It is a point of honour to have as  little mutton as possible on these occasions, as the great treat is  the complete change of fare. I only ventured to introduce it very much  disguised as curry, or in pies. We were all up at daylight on Christmas  morning, and off to the nearest little copse in one of the gullies,  where a few shrubs and small trees and ferns grow, to gather boughs for  the decoration of the washhouse. Marvels were done in the carpentering  line to arrange tables around its walls. The copper, which at first  presented such an obstacle to the symmetry of the adornments, became  their chief glory; it was boarded over, its sides completely hidden by  flags and ferns, and the dessert placed on it peeped out from a bower of  greenery. I don't know how we got our own breakfast; from eleven o'clock  there was the constant announcement \"A horseman coming up the flat;\"  and by twelve, when I as beadle announced that all was ready, a large  congregation of thirty-six came trooping into my little drawing-room. As  soon as it was filled the others clustered round the door; but all  could hear, I think. F---- began the service; and as the notes of the  Christmas Anthem swelled up, I found the tears trembling in my eyes. My  overwhelming thought was that it actually was the very first time those  words had ever been sung or said in that valley--you in England can  hardly realize the immensity of such a thought--\"the first time since  the world was made.\" I think the next sensation was one of extreme  happiness; it seemed such a privilege to be allowed to hold the initial  Christmas service. I had to grasp this idea very tight to keep down the  terrible home-sickness which I felt all day for almost the first time.  There are moments when no advantages or privileges can repress what  Aytoun calls \"the deep, unutterable woe which none save exiles feel.\"    The service only lasted half an hour, beginning and ending with a hymn;  there were three women present besides me--my two servants, and the nice  young wife of a neighbouring shepherd. It was a sultry day, not a breath  of air; but still it is never oppressive at this elevation. We wound up  a big musical-box, set it going in the banqueting-hall (late washhouse),  and marshalled the guests in they were extremely shy as a rule, and so  we soon went away and left them to themselves. They ate incessantly  for two hours--and I hope they enjoyed themselves; then the men lounged  about the stables and smoked, and the three women cleared away a little.  F---- and our gentlemen guests got up athletic sports in the shade which  seemed very popular, though it appeared a great deal of trouble to take  on such a hot day. As the sun sank below the hills it grew much cooler,  and my two maids came with a shamefaced request to be allowed to dance  in the kitchen. I inquired about the music?--that was provided for by  a fiddle and some pipes; so I consented, but I found they wanted me  to start them. I selected as my partner a very decent young farmer who  lives near, but has left his farm and is at work branding our sheep all  shearing-time. The pride and delight of his mate was much greater than  my partner's; he stood near his friend, prompting him through the  mazes of the most extraordinary quadrille you ever saw, with two extra  figures. Then there was an endless polka, in which everybody danced,  like Queen Elizabeth, \"high and disposedly;\" but the ball ended at nine  o'clock, and we were given some cold dinner, for which we were all very  ready. The next morning saw the remains of the festivity cleared away,  and every one hard at work again; for this is our very busiest season.  The work of the station, however, is carried on at the homestead two  miles off. F---- is there all day long, but I see nothing of it. While  the shearers' hearts were tender, I asked them to come over to church on  Sunday, and they have promised to do so: I lend them quantities of  books and papers also, so as to keep them amused and away from the  accommodation-house.          Letter XV: Everyday station life.      Broomielaw, January 1867. You tell me to describe our daily home-life  and domestic surroundings. I dare say it: will appear to be a monotonous  and insignificant existence enough when put on paper, but it suits me  exactly; and, for the first time in my life, I have enough to do, and  also the satisfaction of feeling that I am of some little use to my  fellow-creatures. A lady's influence out here appears to be very great,  and capable of indefinite expansion. She represents refinement and  culture (in Mr. Arnold's sense of the words), and her footsteps on a new  soil such as this should be marked by a trail of light. Of course every  improvement must be the work of time, but I find my neighbours very  willing to help me in my attempts.    A few lines will be sufficient to sketch a day's routine. The first of  my duties is one I especially delight in. I am out very early with a  large tin dish of scraps mixed with a few handfuls of wheat, and my  appearance is the signal for a great commotion among all my fowls  and ducks and pigeons. Such waddling and flying and running with  outstretched wings to me: in fact, I receive a morning greeting from  all the live-stock about the place. I am nearly knocked down by the big  sheep-dogs; the calves come rushing with awkward gambols towards me for  a bit of the fowls' bread, whilst the dogs look out for a bone; but,  in the midst of the confusion, the poultry hold their own; indeed, an  anxious hen eager to secure a breakfast for her chicks will fly at a  big dog, and beat him away from a savoury morsel. I think I ought not to  omit mentioning the devotion of a small pig; it is an exact illustration  of the French proverb which speaks of the inequality of love, for I am  quite passive and do"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#15)"],[1,"made an enormous impression, and yet the people I spoke to were  chary of saying much about him.  Presently I found that he preached  more than the gospel.  His word was \"Africa for the Africans,\" and his  chief point was that the natives had had a great empire in the past,  and might have a great empire again.  He used to tell the story of  Prester John, with all kinds of embroidery of his own.  You see,  Prester John was a good argument for him, for he had been a Christian  as well as a great potentate. 'For years there has been plenty of this  talk in South Africa, chiefly among Christian Kaffirs.  It is what they  call \"Ethiopianism,\" and American negroes are the chief apostles.  For  myself, I always thought the thing perfectly harmless.  I don't care a  fig whether the native missions break away from the parent churches in  England and call themselves by fancy names.  The more freedom they have  in their religious life, the less they are likely to think about  politics.  But I soon found out that Laputa was none of your flabby  educated negroes from America, and I began to watch him.    'I first came across him at a revival meeting in London, where he was a  great success.  He came and spoke to me about my soul, but he gave up  when I dropped into Zulu.  The next time I met him was on the lower  Limpopo, when I had the pleasure of trying to shoot him from a boat.'  Captain Arcoll took his pipe from his mouth and laughed at the  recollection.    'I had got on to an I.D.B. gang, and to my amazement found the  evangelist among them.  But the Reverend John was too much for me.  He  went overboard in spite of the crocodiles, and managed to swim below  water to the reed bed at the side. However, that was a valuable  experience for me, for it gave me a clue.    'I next saw him at a Missionary Conference in Cape Town, and after that  at a meeting of the Geographical Society in London, where I had a long  talk with him.  My reputation does not follow me home, and he thought I  was an English publisher with an interest in missions.  You see I had  no evidence to connect him with I.D.B., and besides I fancied that his  real game was something bigger than that; so I just bided my time and  watched.    'I did my best to get on to his dossier, but it was no easy job.  However, I found out a few things.  He had been educated in the States,  and well educated too, for the man is a good scholar and a great  reader, besides the finest natural orator I have ever heard.  There was  no doubt that he was of Zulu blood, but I could get no traces of his  family.  He must come of high stock, for he is a fine figure of a man.  'Very soon I found it was no good following him in his excursions into  civilization.  There he was merely the educated Kaffir; a great pet of  missionary societies, and a favourite speaker at Church meetings.  You  will find evidence given by him in Blue-Books on native affairs, and he  counted many members of Parliament at home among his correspondents.  I  let that side go, and resolved to dog him when on his evangelizing  tours in the back-veld.    'For six months I stuck to him like a leech.  I am pretty good at  disguises, and he never knew who was the broken-down old Kaffir who  squatted in the dirt at the edge of the crowd when he spoke, or the  half-caste who called him \"Sir\" and drove his Cape-cart.  I had some  queer adventures, but these can wait. The gist of the thing is, that  after six months which turned my hair grey I got a glimmering of what  he was after.  He talked Christianity to the mobs in the kraals, but to  the indunas[3] he told a different story.'    Captain Arcoll helped himself to a drink.  'You can guess what that  story was, Mr Crawfurd.  At full moon when the black cock was blooded,  the Reverend John forgot his Christianity. He was back four centuries  among the Mazimba sweeping down on the Zambesi.  He told them, and they  believed him, that he was the Umkulunkulu, the incarnated spirit of  Prester John.  He told them that he was there to lead the African race  to conquest and empire.  Ay, and he told them more: for he has, or says  he has, the Great Snake itself, the necklet of Prester John.'    Neither of us spoke; we were too occupied with fitting this news into  our chain of knowledge.    Captain Arcoll went on.  'Now that I knew his purpose, I set myself to  find out his preparations.  It was not long before I found a mighty  organization at work from the Zambesi to the Cape.  The great tribes  were up to their necks in the conspiracy, and all manner of little  sects had been taken in.  I have sat at tribal councils and been sworn  a blood brother, and I have used the secret password to get knowledge  in odd places.  It was a dangerous game, and, as I have said, I had my  adventures, but I came safe out of it--with my knowledge.    'The first thing I found out was that there was a great deal of wealth  somewhere among the tribes.  Much of it was in diamonds, which the  labourers stole from the mines and the chiefs impounded.  Nearly every  tribe had its secret chest, and our friend Laputa had the use of them  all.  Of course the difficulty was changing the diamonds into coin, and  he had to start I.D.B. on a big scale.  Your pal, Henriques, was the  chief agent for this, but he had others at Mozambique and Johannesburg,  ay, and in London, whom I have on my list.  With the money, guns and  ammunition were bought, and it seems that a pretty flourishing trade  has been going on for some time. They came in mostly overland through  Portuguese territory, though there have been cases of consignments to  Johannesburg houses, the contents of which did not correspond with the  invoice.  You ask what the Governments were doing to let this go on.  Yes, and you may well ask.  They were all asleep.  They never dreamed  of danger from the natives, and in any case it was difficult to police  the Portuguese side.  Laputa knew our weakness, and he staked  everything on it.    'My first scheme was to lay Laputa by the heels; but no Government  would act on my information.  The man was strongly buttressed by public  support at home, and South Africa has burned her fingers before this  with arbitrary arrests. Then I tried to fasten I.D.B. on him, but I  could not get my proofs till too late.  I nearly had him in Durban, but  he got away; and he never gave me a second chance.  For five months he  and Henriques have been lying low, because their scheme was getting  very ripe.  I have been following them through Zululand and Gazaland,  and I have discovered that the train is ready, and only wants the  match.  For a month I have never been more than five hours behind him  on the trail; and if he has laid his train, I have laid mine also.'    Arcoll's whimsical, humorous face had hardened into grimness, and in  his eyes there was the light of a fierce purpose. The sight of him  comforted me, in spite of his tale.    'But what can he hope to do?' I asked.  'Though he roused every Kaffir  in South Africa he would be beaten.  You say he is an educated man.  He  must know he has no chance in the long run.'    'I said he was an educated man, but he is also a Kaffir.  He can see  the first stage of a thing, and maybe the second, but no more.  That is  the native mind.  If it was not like that our chance would be the  worse.'    'You say the scheme is ripe,' I said; 'how ripe?'    Arcoll looked at the clock.  'In half an hour's time Laputa will be  with 'Mpefu.  There he will stay the night.  To-morrow morning he goes  to Umvelos' to meet Henriques.  To-morrow evening the gathering begins.'    'One question,' I said.  'How big a man is Laputa?'    'The biggest thing that the Kaffirs have ever produced.  I tell you, in  my opinion he is a great genius.  If he had been white he might have  been a second Napoleon.  He is a born leader of men, and as brave as a  lion.  There is no villainy he would not do if necessary, and yet I  should hesitate to call him a blackguard.  Ay, you may look surprised  at me, you two pragmatical Scotsmen; but I have, so to speak, lived  with the man for months, and there's fineness and nobility in him.  He  would be a terrible enemy, but a just one.  He has the heart of a poet  and a king, and it is God's curse that he has been born among the  children of Ham.  I hope to shoot him like a dog in a day or two, but I  am glad to bear testimony to his greatness.'    'If the rising starts to-morrow,' I asked, 'have you any of his plans?'    He picked up a map from the table and opened it.  'The first rendezvous  is somewhere near Sikitola's.  Then they move south, picking up  contingents; and the final concentration is to be on the high veld near  Amsterdam, which is convenient for the Swazis and the Zulus.  After  that I know nothing, but of course there are local concentrations along  the whole line of the Berg from Mashonaland to Basutoland.  Now, look  here. To get to Amsterdam they must cross the Delagoa Bay Railway.  Well, they won't be allowed to.  If they get as far, they will be  scattered there.  As I told you, I too have laid my train.  We have the  police ready all along the scarp of the Berg. Every exit from native  territory is watched, and the frontier farmers are out on commando.  We  have regulars on the Delagoa Bay and Natal lines, and a system of field  telegraphs laid which can summon further troops to any point.  It has  all been kept secret, because we are still in the dark ourselves. The  newspaper public knows nothing about any rising, but in two days every  white household in South Africa will be in a panic.  Make no mistake,  Mr Crawfurd; this is a grim business. We shall smash Laputa and his  men, but it will be a fierce fight, and there will be much good blood  shed.  Besides, it will throw the country back another half-century.  Would to God I had been man enough to put a bullet through his head in  cold blood.  But I could not do it--it was too "]]]
