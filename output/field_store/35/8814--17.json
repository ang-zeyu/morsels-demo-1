There exists, moreover, a poisonous  toad that also, sometimes, possesses this stone, but its effect is much  weaker. To destroy the effect of a cobra's poison you must apply the  toad's stone not later than two minutes after the infliction of the  wound; but the stone of a cobra is effectual to the last. Its healing  power is certain as long as the heart of the wounded man has not ceased  to beat.\"    Bidding us good-bye, the buni advised us to keep the stone in a dry  place and never to leave it near a dead body, also, to hide it during  the sun and moon eclipses, \"otherwise,\" said he, \"it will lose all its  power.\" In case we were bitten by a mad dog, he said, we were to put the  stone into a glass of water and leave it there during the night, next  morning the sufferer was to drink the water and then forget all danger.    \"He is a regular devil and not a man!\" exclaimed our colonel, as soon  as the buni had disappeared on his way to a Shiva temple, where, by the  way, we were not admitted.    \"As simple a mortal as you or I,\" remarked the Rajput with a smile,  \"and, what is more, he is very ignorant. The truth is, he has been  brought up in a Shivaite pagoda, like all the real snake-charmers. Shiva  is the patron god of snakes, and the Brahmans teach the bunis to produce  all kinds of mesmeric tricks by empirical methods, never explaining to  them the theoretical principles, but assuring them that Shiva is behind  every phenomenon. So that the bunis sincerely ascribe to their god the  honor of their 'miracles.\"'    \"The Government of India offers a reward for an antidote to the poison  of the cobra. Why then do the bunis not claim it, rather than let  thousands of people die helpless?\"    \"The Brahmans would never suffer that. If the Government took the  trouble to examine carefully the statistics of deaths caused by snakes,  it would be found that no Hindu of the Shivaite sect has ever died from  the bite of a cobra. They let people of other sects die, but save the  members of their own flock.\"    \"But did we not see how easily he parted with his secret,  notwithstanding we were foreigners. Why should not the English buy it as  readily?\"    \"Because this secret is quite useless in the hands of Europeans. The  Hindus do not try to conceal it, because they are perfectly certain that  without their aid nobody can make any use of it. The stone will retain  its wonderful power only when it is taken from a live cobra. In order to  catch the snake without killing it, it must be cast into a lethargy, or,  if you prefer the term, charmed. Who is there among the foreigners who  is able to do this? Even amongst the Hindus, you will not find a single  individual in all India who possesses this ancient secret, unless he be  a disciple of the Shivaite Brahmans. Only Brahmans of this sect possess  a monopoly of the secret, and not all even of them, only those, in  short, who belong to the pseudo-Patanjali school, who are usually called  Bhuta ascetics. Now there exist, scattered over the whole of India, only  about half-a-dozen of their pagoda schools, and the inmates would rather  part with their very lives than with their secret.\"    \"We have paid only two rupees for a secret which proved as strong in the  colonel's hands as in the hands of the buni. Is it then so difficult to  procure a store of these stones?\" Our friend laughed.    \"In a few days,\" said he, \"the talisman will lose all its healing powers  in your inexperienced hands. This is the reason why he let it go at such  a low price, which he is, probably, at this moment sacrificing before  the altar of his deity. I guarantee you a week's activity for your  purchase, but after that time it will only be fit to be thrown out of  the window.\"    We soon learned how true were these words. On the following day we came  across a little girl, bitten by a green scorpion. She seemed to be in  the last convulsions. No sooner had we applied the stone than the child  seemed relieved, and, in an hour, she was gaily playing about, whereas,  even in the case of the sting of a common black scorpion, the patient  suffers for two weeks. But when, about ten days later, we tried the  experiment of the stone upon a poor coolie, just bitten by a cobra, it  would not even stick to the wound, and the poor wretch shortly expired.  I do not take upon myself to offer, either a defence, or an explanation  of the virtues of the \"stone.\" I simply state the facts and leave the  future career of the story to its own fate. The sceptics may deal with  it as they will. Yet I can easily find people in India who will bear  witness to my accuracy.    In this connection I was told a funny story. When Dr. (now Sir J.)  Fayrer, who lately published his Thanatophidia, a book on the venomous  snakes of India, a work well known throughout Europe, he categorically  stated in it his disbelief in the wondrous snake-charmers of India.  However, about a fortnight or so after the book appeared amongst the  Anglo-Indians, a cobra bit his own cook. A buni, who happened to pass  by, readily offered to save the man's life. It stands to reason that  the celebrated naturalist could not accept such an offer. Nevertheless,  Major Kelly and other officers urged him to permit the experiment.  Declaring that in spite of all, in less than an hour his cook would be  no more, he gave his consent. But it happened that in less than an hour  the cook was quietly preparing dinner in the kitchen, and, it is added,  Dr. Fayrer seriously thought of throwing his book into the fire.    The day grew dreadfully hot. We felt the heat of the rocks in spite of  our thick-soled shoes. Besides, the general curiosity aroused by our  presence, and the unceremonious persecutions of the crowd, were becoming  tiring. We resolved to \"go home,\" that is to say, to return to the cool  cave, six hundred paces from the temple, where we were to spend the  evening and to sleep. We would wait no longer for our Hindu companions,  who had gone to see the fair, and so we started by ourselves.----      On approaching the entrance of the temple we were struck by the  appearance of a young man, who stood apart from the crowd and was of  an ideal beauty. He was a member of the Sadhu sect, a \"candidate for  Saintship,\" to use the expression of one of our party.    The Sadhus differ greatly from every other sect. They never appear  unclothed, do not cover themselves with damp ashes, wear no painted  signs on their faces, or foreheads, and do not worship idols. Belonging  to the Adwaiti section of the Vedantic school, they believe only in  Parabrahm (the great spirit). The young man looked quite decent in his  light yellow costume, a kind of nightgown without sleeves. He had long  hair, and his head was uncovered. His elbow rested on the back of a cow,  which was itself well calculated to attract attention, for, in addition  to her four perfectly shaped legs, she had a fifth growing out of her  hump. This wonderful freak of nature used its fifth leg as if it were  a hand and arm, hunting and killing tiresome flies, and scratching  its head with the hoof. At first we thought it was a trick to attract  attention, and even felt offended with the animal, as well as with its  handsome owner, but, coming nearer, we saw that it was no trick, but an  actual sport of mischievous Nature. From the young man we learned that  the cow had been presented to him by the Maharaja Holkar, and that her  milk had been his only food during the last two years.    Sadhus are aspirants to the Raj Yoga, and, as I have said above, usually  belong to the school of the Vedanta. That is to say, they are disciples  of initiates who have entirely resigned the life of the world, and lead  a life of monastic chastity. Between the Sadhus and the Shivaite  bunis there exists a mortal enmity, which manifests itself by a silent  contempt on the side of the Sadhus, and on that of the bunis by constant  attempts to sweep their rivals off the face of the earth. This antipathy  is as marked as that between light and darkness, and reminds one of the  dualism of the Ahura-Mazda and Ahriman of the Zoroastrians. Masses  of people look up to the first as to Magi, sons of the sun and of the  Divine Principle, while the latter are dreaded as dangerous sorcerers.  Having heard most wonderful accounts of the former, we were burning  with anxiety to see some of the \"miracles\" ascribed to them by some even  among the Englishmen. We eagerly invited the Sadhu to visit our vihara  during the evening. But the handsome ascetic sternly refused, for the  reason that we were staying within the temple of the idol-worshippers,  the very air of which would prove antagonistic to him. We offered him  money, but he would not touch it, and so we parted.    A path, or rather a ledge cut along the perpendicular face of a rocky  mass 200 feet high, led from the chief temple to our vihara. A man needs  good eyes, sure feet, and a very strong head to avoid sliding down the  precipice at the first false step. Any help would be quite out of the  question, for, the ledge being only two feet wide, no one could walk  side by side with another. We had to walk one by one, appealing for aid  only to the whole of our personal courage. But the courage of many of us  was gone on an unlimited furlough. The position of our American colonel  was the worst, for he was very stout and short-sighted, which defects,  taken together, caused him frequent vertigos. To keep up our spirits  we indulged in a choral performance of the duet from Norma, \"Moriam'  insieme,\" holding each other's hands the while, to ensure our being  spared by death or dying all four in company. But the colonel did not  fail to frighten us nearly out of our lives. We were already half way up  to the cave when he made a false step, staggered, lost hold of my hand,  and rolled over the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6702"],[0,"Life of Harriet Beecher Stowe (#15)"],[1,"gladly have been excused this conformity  to ordinary custom had not necessity required Mr. Stowe to visit  Columbus, and I had too much adhesiveness not to go too. Ohio roads  at this season are no joke, I can tell you, though we were, on the  whole, wonderfully taken care of, and our expedition included as many  pleasures as an expedition at this time of the year _ever_ could.    \"And now, my dear, perhaps the wonder to you, as to me, is how this  momentous crisis in the life of such a wisp of nerve as myself has  been transacted so quietly. My dear, it is a wonder to myself. I am  tranquil, quiet, and happy. I look _only_ on the present, and leave the  future with Him who has hitherto been so kind to me. 'Take no thought  for the morrow' is my motto, and my comfort is to rest on Him in whose  house there are many mansions provided when these fleeting earthly ones  pass away.    \"Dear Georgy, naughty girl that I am, it is a month that I have let  the above lie by, because I got into a strain of emotion in it that I  dreaded to return to. Well, so it shall be no longer. In about five  weeks Mr. Stowe and myself start for New England. He sails the first  of May. I am going with him to Boston, New York, and other places, and  shall stop finally at Hartford, whence, as soon as he is gone, it is my  intention to return westward.\"    This reference to her husband as about to leave her relates to his  sailing for Europe to purchase books for Lane Seminary, and also as a  commissioner appointed by the State of Ohio to investigate the public  school systems of the old world. He had long been convinced that higher  education was impossible in the West without a higher grade of public  schools, and had in 1833 been one of the founders in Cincinnati of  \"The College of Teachers,\" an institution that existed for ten years,  and exerted a widespread influence. Its objects were to popularize the  common schools, raise the standard of teachers, and create a demand  for education among the people. Professor Stowe was associated in this  movement with many of the leading intellects of Ohio at that time, and  among them were Albert Pickett, Dr. Drake, Smith Grimke, Archbishop  Purcell, President A. H. McGuffey, Dr. Beecher, Lydia Sigourney,  Caroline Lee Hentz, and others. Their influence finally extended to the  state legislature, and it was concluded to authorize Professor Stowe,  when abroad, to investigate and report upon the common school systems  of Europe, especially Prussia.    He sailed from New York for London in the ship Montreal, Captain  Champlin, on June 8, 1836, and carried with him, to be opened only  after he was at sea, a letter from his wife, from which the following  extract is made:--    \"Now, my dear, that you are gone where you are out of the reach of my  care, advice, and good management, it is fitting that you should have  something under my hand and seal for your comfort and furtherance in  the new world you are going to. Firstly, I must caution you to set  your face as a flint against the 'cultivation of indigo,' as Elisabeth  calls it, in any way or shape. Keep yourself from it most scrupulously,  and though you are unprovided with that precious and savory treatise  entitled 'Kemper's Consolations,'[2] yet you can exercise yourself to  recall and set in order such parts thereof as would more particularly  suit your case, particularly those portions wherewith you so much  consoled Kate, Aunt Esther, and your unworthy handmaid, while you yet  tarried at Walnut Hills. But seriously, dear one, you must give more  way to hope than to memory. You are going to a new scene now, and one  that I hope will be full of enjoyment to you. I want you to take the  good of it.    \"Only think of all you expect to see: the great libraries and  beautiful paintings, fine churches, and, above all, think of seeing  Tholuck, your great Apollo. My dear, I wish I were a man in your place;  if I wouldn't have a grand time!\"    During her husband's absence abroad Mrs. Stowe lived quietly in  Cincinnati with her father and brothers. She wrote occasionally short  stories, articles, and essays for publication in the \"Western Monthly  Magazine\" or the \"New York Evangelist,\" and maintained a constant  correspondence with her husband by means of a daily journal, which was  forwarded to him once a month. She also assisted her brother, Henry  Ward, who had accepted a temporary position as editor of the \"Journal,\"  a small daily paper published in the city.    At this time the question of slavery was an exciting one in Cincinnati,  and Lane Seminary had become a hotbed of abolition. The anti-slavery  movement among the students was headed by Theodore D. Weld, one  of their number, who had procured funds to complete his education  by lecturing through the South. While thus engaged he had been so  impressed with the evils and horrors of slavery that he had become  a radical abolitionist, and had succeeded in converting several  Southerners to his views of the subject. Among them was Mr. J. G.  Birney of Huntsville, Alabama, who not only liberated his slaves, but  in connection with Dr. Gamaliel Bailey of Cincinnati founded in that  city an anti-slavery paper called \"The Philanthropist.\" This paper  was finally suppressed, and its office wrecked by a mob instigated by  Kentucky slaveholders, and it is of this event that Mrs. Stowe writes  to her husband as follows:--    \"Yesterday evening I spent scribbling for Henry's newspaper (the  'Journal') in this wise: 'Birney's printing-press has been mobbed, and  many of the respectable citizens are disposed to wink at the outrage in  consideration of its moving in the line of their prejudices.'    \"I wrote a conversational sketch, in which I rather satirized this  inconsistent spirit, and brought out the effects of patronizing _any_  violation of private rights. It was in a light, sketchy style, designed  to draw attention to a long editorial of Henry's in which he considers  the subject fully and seriously. His piece is, I think, a powerful  one; indeed, he does write very strongly. I am quite proud of his  editorials; they are well studied, earnest, and dignified. I think  he will make a first-rate writer. Both our pieces have gone to press  to-day, with Charles's article on music, and we have had not a little  diversion about our _family newspaper_.    \"I thought, when I was writing last night, that I was, like a good  wife, defending one of your principles in your absence, and wanted you  to see how manfully I talked about it. Henry has also taken up and  examined the question of the Seminole Indians, and done it very nobly.\"    Again:--    \"The excitement about Birney continues to increase. The keeper of the  Franklin Hotel was assailed by a document subscribed to by many of his  boarders demanding that Birney should be turned out of doors. He chose  to negative the demand, and twelve of his boarders immediately left,  Dr. F. among the number. A meeting has been convoked by means of a  handbill, in which some of the most respectable men of the city are  invited by name to come together and consider the question whether they  will allow Mr. Birney to continue his paper in the city. Mr. Greene  says that, to his utter surprise, many of the most respectable and  influential citizens gave out that they should go.    \"He was one of the number they invited, but he told those who came to  him that he would have nothing to do with disorderly public meetings or  mobs in any shape, and that he was entirely opposed to the whole thing.    \"I presume they will have a hot meeting, if they have any at all.    \"I wish father were at home to preach a sermon to his church, for many  of its members do not frown on these things as they ought.\"    \"Later: The meeting was held, and was headed by Morgan, Neville, Judge  Burke, and I know not who else. Judge Burnet was present and consented  to their acts. The mob madness is certainly upon this city when men of  sense and standing will pass resolutions approving in so many words of  things done contrary to law, as one of the resolutions of this meeting  did. It quoted the demolition of the tea in Boston harbor as being  authority and precedent.    \"A large body, perhaps the majority of citizens, disapprove, but I fear  there will not be public disavowal. Even N. Wright but faintly opposes,  and Dr. Fore has been exceedingly violent. Mr. Hammond (editor of the  'Gazette') in a very dignified and judicious manner has condemned the  whole thing, and Henry has opposed, but otherwise the papers have  either been silent or in favor of mobs. We shall see what the result  will be in a few days.    \"For my part, I can easily see how such proceedings may make converts  to abolitionism, for already my sympathies are strongly enlisted for  Mr. Birney, and I hope that he will stand his ground and assert his  rights. The office is fire-proof, and inclosed by high walls. I wish he  would man it with armed men and see what can be done. If I were a man  I would go, for one, and take good care of at least one window. Henry  sits opposite me writing a most valiant editorial, and tells me to tell  you he is waxing mighty in battle.\"    In another letter she writes:--    \"I told you in my last that the mob broke into Birney's press, where,  however, the mischief done was but slight. The object appeared to be  principally to terrify. Immediately there followed a general excitement  in which even good men in their panic and prejudice about abolitionism  forgot that mobs were worse evils than these, talked against Birney,  and winked at the outrage; N. Wright and Judge Burnet, for example.  Meanwhile the turbulent spirits went beyond this and talked of  revolution and of righting things without law that could not be righted  by it. At the head of these were Morgan, Neville, Longworth, Joseph  Graham, and Judge Burke. A meeting was convoked at Lower Market Street  to decide whether"]]]
