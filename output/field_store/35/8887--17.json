Often tin pails to catch the drippings were hung under the  stove-pipes, forming a further chaste and elegant church-decoration. Many  serious objections were made to the stoves besides the aesthetic ones.  It was alleged that they would be the means of starting many destructive  conflagrations; that they caused severe headaches in the church attendants;  and worst of all, that the _heat warped the ladies' tortoise-shell  back-combs_.    The church reformers contended, on the other hand, that no one could  properly receive spiritual comfort while enduring such decided bodily  discomfort. They hoped that with increased physical warmth, fervor in  religion would be equally augmented,--that, as Cowper wrote,--      \"The churches warmed, they would no longer hold    Such frozen figures, stiff as they are cold.\"    Many were the quarrels and discussions that arose in New England  communities over the purchase and use of stoves, and many were the meetings  held and votes taken upon the important subject.    \"Peter Parley\"--Mr. Samuel Goodrich--gave, in his \"Recollections,\" a very  amusing account of the sufferings endured by the wife of an anti-stove  deacon. She came to church with a look of perfect resignation on the  Sabbath of the stove's introduction, and swept past the unwelcome intruder  with averted head, and into her pew. She sat there through the service,  growing paler with the unaccustomed heat, until the minister's words about  \"heaping coals of fire\" brought too keen a sense of the overwhelming and  unhealthful stove-heat to her mind, and she fainted. She was carried out of  church, and upon recovering said languidly that it \"was the heat from the  stove.\" A most complete and sudden resuscitation was effected, however,  when she was informed of the fact that no fire had as yet been lighted in  the new church-furnishing.    Similar chronicles exist about other New England churches, and bear a  striking resemblance to each other. Rev. Henry Ward Beecher in an address  delivered in New York on December 20, 1853, the anniversary of the Landing  of the Pilgrims, referred to the opposition made to the introduction of  stoves into the old meeting-house in Litchfield, Connecticut, during the  ministry of his father, and gave an amusing account of the results of the  introgression. This allusion called up many reminiscences of anti-stove  wars, and a writer in the \"New York Enquirer\" told the same story of the  fainting woman in Litchfield meeting, who began to fan herself and at  length swooned, saying when she recovered \"that the heat of the horrid  stove had caused her to faint.\" A correspondent of the \"Cleveland Herald\"  confirmed the fact that the fainting episode occurred in the Litchfield  meeting-house. The editor of the \"Hartford Daily Courant\" thus added his  testimony:--        \"Violent opposition had been made to the introduction of a stove in the      old meeting-house, and an attempt made in vain to induce the soc      to purchase one. The writer was one of seven young men who finally      purchased a stove and requested permission to put it up in the      meeting-house on trial. After much difficulty the committee consented.      It was all arranged on Saturday afternoon, and on Sunday we took our      seats in the Bass, rather earlier than usual, to see the fun. It was a      warm November Sunday, in which the sun shone cheerfully and warmly on      the old south steps and into the naked windows. The stove stood in the      middle aisle, rather in front of the Tenor Gallery. People came in and      stared. Good old Deacon Trowbridge, one of the most simple-hearted and      worthy men of that generation, had, as Mr. Beecher says, been induced      to give up his opposition. He shook his head, however, as he felt the      heat reflected from it, and gathered up the skirts of his great      as he passed up the broad aisle to the deacon's seat. Old Uncle Noah      Stone, a wealthy farmer of the West End, who sat near, scowled and      muttered at the effects of the heat, but waited until noon to utter his      maledictions over his nut-cakes and cheese at the intermission. There      had in fact been _no fire in the stove_, the day being too warm.      We were too much upon the broad grin to be very devotional, and smiled      rather loudly at the funny things we saw. But when the editor of the      village paper, Mr. Bunce, came in (who was a believer in stoves in      churches) and with a most satisfactory air warmed his hands by the      stove, keeping the skirts of his great-coat carefully between his      knees, we could stand it no longer but dropped invisible behind the      breastwork. But the climax of the whole was (as the Cleveland man says)      when Mrs. Peck went out in the middle of the service. It was, however,      the means of reconciling the whole society; for after that first day we      heard no more opposition to the warm stove in the meeting-house.\"    With all this corroborative evidence I think it is fully proved that the  event really happened in Litchfield, and that the honor was stolen for  other towns by unveracious chroniclers; otherwise we must believe in an  amazing unanimity of church-joking and sham-fainting all over New England.    The very nature, the stern, pleasure-hating and trial-glorying Puritan  nature, which made our forefathers leave their English homes to come, for  the love of God and the freedom of conscience, to these wild, barren, and  unwelcoming shores, made them also endure with fortitude and almost with  satisfaction all personal discomforts, and caused them to cling with  persistent firmness to such outward symbols of austere contempt of  luxury, and such narrow-minded signs of love of simplicity as the lack of  comfortable warmth during the time of public worship. The religion which  they had endured such bitter hardships to establish, did not, in their  minds, need any shielding and coddling to keep it alive, but thrived far  better on Spartan severity and simplicity; hence, it took two centuries of  gradual and most tardy softening and modifying of character to prepare the  Puritan mind for so advanced a reform and luxury as proper warmth in the  meeting-houses in winter.          IX.    The Noon-House.        There might have been seen a hundred years ago, by the side of many an old  meeting-house in New England, a long, low, mean, stable-like building, with  a rough stone chimney at one end. This was the \"noon-house,\" or \"Sabba-day  house,\" or \"horse-hows,\" as it was variously called. It was a place of  refuge in the winter time, at the noon interval between the two services,  for the half-frozen members of the pious congregation, who found there the  grateful warmth which the house of God denied. They built in the rude stone  fireplace a great fire of logs, and in front of the blazing wood ate their  noon-day meal of cold pie, of doughnuts, of pork and peas, or of brown  bread with cheese, which they had brought safely packed in their capacious  saddlebags. The dining-place smelt to heaven of horses, for often at the  further end of the noon-house were stabled the patient steeds that, doubly  burdened, had borne the Puritans and their wives to meeting; but this  stable-odor did not hinder appetite, nor did the warm equine breaths that  helped to temper the atmosphere of the noon-house offend the senses of the  sturdy Puritans. From the blazing fire in this \"life-saving station\" the  women replenished their little foot-stoves with fresh, hot coals, and thus  helped to make endurable the icy rigor of the long afternoon service.    If the winter Sabbath Day were specially severe, a \"hired-man,\" or one of  the grown sons of the family, was sent at an early hour to the noon-house  in advance of the other church-attendants, and he started in the rough  fireplace a fire for their welcome after their long, cold, morning ride;  and before its cheerful blaze they thoroughly warmed themselves before  entering the icy meeting-house. The embers were carefully covered over  and left to start a second blaze at the nooning, covered again during the  afternoon service, and kindled up still a third time to warm the chilled  worshippers ere they started for their cold ride home in the winter  twilight. And when the horses were saddled, or were harnessed and hitched  into the great box-sleighs or \"pungs,\" and when the good Puritans were well  wrapped up, the dying coals were raked out for safety and the noon-house  was left as quiet and as cold as the deserted meeting-house until the  following Sabbath or Lecture day.    If the meeting-house chanced to stand in the middle of the town (as was  the universal custom in the earliest colonial days) of course a noon-house  would be rarely built, for it would plainly not be needed. Nor was a  \"Sabba-day house\" always seen in more lonely situations, if the sanctuary  were placed near the substantial farm-house of a hospitable farmer; for to  that friendly shelter the whole congregation would at noon-time repair and  absorb to the fullest degree the welcome cider and warmth.    In Lexington for many years after the Revolutionary War, the winter  church-goers who came from any distance spent the nooning at the Dudley  Tavern, where a roaring fire was built in the inn-parlor, and there the  women and children ate their midday lunch. The men gathered in the bar-room  and drank flip, and ate the tavern gingerbread and cheese, and talked over  the horrors and glories of the war. In Haverhill, Derby, and many other  towns, the school-house, which was built on the village green beside the  church, was used for a noon-house by the church members, though not by  their horses. The house of learning was never chimneyless and fireless, as  was the house of God.

They bore in the senseless, shattered body, and for hours tried  everything that skill and sciences could devise to save the young man's  life. But every effort was in vain, and as the sun set Sir Jasper lay  dying. Conscious at last, and able to speak, he looked about him with a  troubled glance, and seemed struggling with some desire that  overmastered pain and held death at bay.    \"I want Maurice,\" he feebly said, at length.    \"Dear lad, I'm here,\" answered his cousin's voice from a seat in the  shadow of the half-drawn curtains.    \"Always near when I need you. Many a scrape have you helped me out of,  but this is beyond your power,\" and a faint smile passed over Jasper's  lips as the past flitted before his mind. But the smile died, and a  groan of pain escaped him as he cried suddenly, \"Quick! Let me tell it  before it is too late! Maurice never will, but bear the shame all his  life that my dead name may be untarnished. Bring Edith; she must hear  the truth.\"    She was soon there, and, lying in his mother's arms, one hand in his  cousin's, and one on his sister's bent head, Jasper rapidly told the  secret which had burdened him for a year.    \"I did it; I forged my uncle's name when I had lost so heavily at play  that I dared not tell my mother, or squander more of my own fortune. I  deceived Maurice, and let him think the check a genuine one; I made him  present it and get the money, and when all went well I fancied I was  safe. But my uncle discovered it secretly, said nothing, and, believing  Maurice the forger, disinherited him. I never knew this till the old man  died, and then it was too late. I confessed to Maurice, and he forgave  me. He said, 'I am helpless now, shut out from the world, with nothing  to lose or gain, and soon to be forgotten by those who once knew me, so  let the suspicion of shame, if any such there be, still cling to me, and  do you go your way, rich, happy, honorable, and untouched by any shadow  on your fame.' Mother, I let him do it, unconscious as he was that many  knew the secret sin and fancied him the doer of it.\"    \"Hush, Jasper, let it pass. I can bear it; I promised your dear father  to be your staunch friend through life, and I have only kept my word.\"    \"God knows you have, but now my life ends, and I cannot die till you are  cleared. Edith, I told you half the truth, and you would have used it  against him had not some angel sent this girl to touch your heart. You  have done your part to atone for the past, now let me do mine. Mother,  Tavie loves him, he has risked life and honor for me. Repay him  generously and give him this.\"    With feeble touch Sir Jasper tried to lay his sister's hand in  Treherne's as he spoke; Mrs. Snowdon helped him, and as my lady bowed  her head in silent acquiescence, a joyful smile shone on the dying  man's face.    \"One more confession, and then I am ready,\" he said, looking up into the  face of the woman whom he had loved with all the power of a shallow  nature. \"It was a jest to you, Edith, but it was bitter earnest to me,  for I loved you, sinful as it was. Ask your husband to forgive me, and  tell him it was better I should die than live to mar a good man's peace.  Kiss me once, and make him happy for my sake.\"    She touched his cold lips with remorseful tenderness, and in the same  breath registered a vow to obey that dying prayer.    \"Tavie dear, Maurice, my brother, God bless you both. Good-bye, Mother.  He will be a better son than I have been to you.\" Then, the reckless  spirit of the man surviving to the last, Sir Jasper laughed faintly, as  he seemed to beckon some invisible shape, and died saying gaily, \"Now,  Father Abbot, lead on, I'll follow you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A year later three weddings were celebrated on the same day and in the  same church. Maurice Treherne, a well man, led up his cousin. Frank  Annon rewarded Blanche's patient siege by an unconditional surrender,  and, to the infinite amusement of Mrs. Grundy, Major Royston publicly  confessed himself outgeneraled by merry Rose. The triple wedding feast  was celebrated at Treherne Abbey, and no uncanny visitor marred its  festivities, for never again was the north gallery haunted by the  ghostly Abbot."]]]
