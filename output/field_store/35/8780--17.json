Tuckey's Embomma was an inland banza or town, and the site  of the factories was called Market Point; the Expedition map and  the hydrographic chart term it Loombee, the latter being properly  the name of a large quitanda (market) lying two miles to the  north-west. Early in the present century it is described as a  village of a hundred huts, opposite which trading vessels  anchored under charge of the \"Fuka or king's merchant;\" no market  was held there, lest, in case of dispute, the royal person might  suffer. Although the main features of our maps are still correct,  there have been great changes in the river-bed between Porto da  Lenha and Boma, especially about the latter place, which should  be transferred from its present site to Lumbi. The broad Chisalla  Creek, which Mr. Maxwell calls Logan, between the northern bank  and the island \"Booka Embomma,\" is now an arm only 200 feet wide.  In fact all the bank about Boma, like the lower delta, urgently  calls for re-surveying.    This part of the river belongs to the \"Rei dos Reis,\" Nessalla,  under whom are some ten chief officers called \"kings,\" who buy  and sell; indeed, Africa knows no other. The title is prostituted  throughout the West Coast, but it is nowhere so degraded as in  the Congo regions; the whites abuse it to flatter the vanity of  the astute negro, who accepts it with a view to results--a \"king-  dash\" must, of course, be greater than that of a subject. Every  fellow with one black coat becomes a \"preese\" (prince), and if he  has two he styles himself a \"king.\" Without permission of the  \"King of Kings\" we could obtain neither interpreter, canoe, nor  crew; a visit to Banza Chisalal was therefore necessary and, as  it would have been vain to ask anything empty-handed, I took with  me a fine spangled cloak, a piece of chintz, and a case of ship's  rum, the whole worth £9.    At 6.30 A.M. on September 5th we set out up stream in a fine  canoe, wall-sided and rather crank, but allowing the comfort of  chairs. She was of Mayumba make, superior to anything built on  the river, and the six men that drove her stood up to pole, and  paddle. Above Boma the hills, which are the outlines of the west  African Ghats, form a graceful semicircle, separated from the  water by a flat terrace garnished with little villages and tree-  islets. On the north bank are many of the crater-like sinks which  dot the coast from the Gaboon to Loango. We hugged the right side  to avoid the rapid swirl; there was no backwater at the points,  and hard work was required to prevent our being swept against the  boulders of gneiss, schiste, and pudding-stone edging the shores  and stretching into the stream. Here the fish is excellent as at  Porto cla Lenha, and we found the people catching it in large  spoon-shaped basins: I enquired about the Peixe mulher (woman-  fish), the French sirène, which old missioners describe as an  African mermaid, not exactly as she appeared to the \"lovely lord  of Colonsay,\" and which Barbot figures with \"two strutting  breasts.\" He makes the flesh taste like pork, and tells us that  the small bones of the hand were good for gravel, whilst  bracelets made of the left rib were worn near the heart, to stop  bleeding. This manatus, like the elephant and the hippopotamus,  has long disappeared before the gun.    After some three quarters of an hour we reached the entrance of  Chisalla Creek, which is the northernmost branch of the main  stream. On the left (north) was a plain showing traces of a large  village, and we sighted our first grass-island--a compact mass of  fibrous, earth-washed roots and reedy vegetation, inhabited by  serpents and ardeine birds. To the right, or southward, rises the  tall island of Boma, rocky and wooded, which a narrow channel  separates from its eastern neighbour, Chisalla Islet. The latter  is the royal Pere la Chaise, the graves being kept carefully  concealed; white men who have visited the ground to shoot  antelope have had reason to regret the step. Here also lie three  officers of the Congo Expedition-- Messrs. Galwey, Tudor, and  Cranch--forgotten, as Gamboa and Reitz at Mombasah.    The banks of the winding creek were beautified with the  malaguetta pepper, the ipomsea, the hibiscus, and a yellow flower  growing upon an aquatic plant like a magnified water-cress.  Animal life became somewhat less rare; we saw sandpipers, hawks,  white and black fish-eagles, and long-legged water-hens, here  supposed to give excellent sport. An embryo rapid, formed by a  gneiss-band connecting the north bank with the islet, delayed us,  and the rocks on the right showed pot-holes dug by the poling-  staves; during the rains canoes from Boma avoid this place, and  seek fuel down stream. After a total of two hours and a quarter  we reached Banza Chisalla: it is a \"small country,\" in African  parlance, a succursal of Boma proper, the Banza on the hills  beyond the reedy, grassy plain. The site is charming--a flat  palm-orchard backed by an amphitheatre of high-rolling ground,  and the majestic stream approaches it through a gate, whose right  staple is the tall Chisalla, and whose left is a rocky islet with  outlying needles.    We ascended the river-bank, greeted by the usual accidents of an  African reception; the men shouted, the women rushed screaming  under cover, and the children stood howling at the horrible  sight. A few paces placed us at the \"palace,\" a heap of huts,  surrounded by an old reed-fence. The audience-room was a trifle  larger than usual, with low shady eaves, a half-flying roof, and  a pair of doorways for the dangerous but indispensable draught; a  veteran sofa and a few rickety chairs composed the furniture, and  the throne was known by its boarded seat, which would have been  useful in taking a \"lamp-bath.\"    Presently entered the \"Rei dos Reis,\" Nessalla: the old man,  whose appearance argued prosperity, was en grande tenue, the  State costume of Tuckey's, not of Merolla's day. The crown was  the usual \"berretta\" (night-cap) of open work; the sceptre, a  drum-major's staff; the robes, a \"parochial\" beadle's coat of  scarlet cloth, edged with tinsel gold lace. His neck was adorned  with hair circlets of elephants' tails, strung with coral and  beads; the effect, to compare black with white, was that of Beau  Brummell's far-famed waterfall tie, and the head seemed supported  as if on a narrow-rimmed \"charger.\" The only other ornament was a  broad silver ring welded round the ankle, and drawing attention  to a foot which, all things considered, was small and well  shaped.    Some of the chiefs had copper rings of home manufacture, with  neatly cut raised figures. The king held in his right hand an  article which at first puzzled us--a foot's length of split reed,  with the bulbous root attached. He may not, like his vassals,  point with the finger, and without pointing an African can hardly  give an order. Moreover, the Sangálávú or Malaguetta pepper  (Amomum granum Paradisi), fresh or old, is not only a toothstick,  but a fetish of superior power when carried on journeys.  Professor Smith writes \"Sangala woo,\" and tells us that it was  always kept fresh in the house, to be rolled in the hands when  invoking the Fetish during war-time; moreover, it was chewed to  be spat at the enemy. Possibly he confuses it with the use as a  tooth-stick, the article which Asia and Africa prefer to the  unclean hog's- bristle brush of Europe.    On the left of the throne sat the Nchinu, or \"second king,\"  attired in a footman's livery of olive-coloured cloth, white-worn  at the seams, and gleaming with plated buttons, upon which was  the ex-owner's crest--a cubit arm.    The stranger in Africa marvels why men, who, as Dahome shows, can  affect a tasteful simplicity, will make themselves such \"guys.\"  When looking at these caricatures, he is tempted to read  (literally) learned Montesquieu, \"It is hardly to be believed  that God, who is a wise being, should place a soul, especially a  good soul, in such a black, ugly body,\" and to consider the few  exceptions as mere \"sporting plants.\" But the negro combines with  inordinate love of finery the true savage taste--an imitative  nature,--and where he cannot copy the Asiatic he must ape the  European; only in the former pursuit he rises above, in the  latter he sinks below his own proper standard. Similarly, as a  convert, he is ennobled by El Islam; in rare cases, which may be  counted upon the fingers, he is civilized by Christianity; but,  as a rule, the latter benefits him so far only as it abolishes  the barbarous and murderous rites of Paganism.    But there is also a sound mundane reason which causes the African  \"king\" to pose in these cast-off borrowed plumes. Contrast with  his three-quarter nude subjects gives him a name; the name  commands respect; respect increases \"dash;\" and dash means  dollars. For his brain, dense and dead enough to resist  education, is ever alive and alert to his own interest; whilst  the concentration of its small powers prevails against those who,  in all other points, are notably his superiors. The whole of  negro Africa teaches this lesson. \"The Ethiopians,\" says Father  Merolla, \"are not so dull and stupid as is commonly imagined, but  rather more subtle and cunning than ordinary;\" and he adds an  instance of far-sighted treachery, which would not have been  despicable even in a Hindoo.    A desultory palaver \"came up;\" the soul of the meeting not being  present. M. Pissot explained my wish to \"take walk and make  book,\" carefully insisting upon the fact that I came to spend,  not to gain money. The grizzled senior's face, before crumpled  like a \"wet cloak ill laid up,\" expanded at these last words, and  with a grunt, which plainly meant \"by' m' by,\" he rose, and  retired to drink-- a call of nature which the decencies of  barbarous dignity require to be answered in private. He "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5767"],[0,"The Fireside Chats of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (#15)"],[1," serve our clearly national needs, the majority of  the Court has been assuming the power to pass on the wisdom of  these acts of the Congress--and to approve or disapprove the public  policy written into these laws.    That is not only my accusation.  It is the accusation of most  distinguished justices of the present Supreme Court.  I have not the  time to quote to you all the language used by dissenting justices  in many of these cases.  But in the case holding the Railroad  Retirement Act unconstitutional, for instance, Chief Justice Hughes  said in a dissenting opinion that the majority opinion was \"a  departure from sound principles,\" and placed \"an unwarranted  limitation upon the commerce clause.\"  And three other justices  agreed with him.    In the case of holding the A.A.A. unconstitutional, Justice Stone  said of the majority opinion that it was a \"tortured construction  of the Constitution.\"  And two other justices agreed with him.    In the case holding the New York Minimum Wage Law unconstitutional,  Justice Stone said that the majority were actually reading into the  Constitution their own \"personal economic predilections,\" and that  if the legislative power is not left free to choose the methods of  solving the problems of poverty, subsistence, and health of large  numbers in the community, then \"government is to be rendered  impotent.\"  And two other justices agreed with him.    In the face of these dissenting opinions, there is no basis for the  claim made by some members of the Court that something in the  Constitution has compelled them regretfully to thwart the will of  the people.    In the face of such dissenting opinions, it is perfectly clear  that, as Chief Justice Hughes has said, \"We are under a  Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.\"    The Court in addition to the proper use of its judicial functions  has improperly set itself up as a third house of the Congress--a  super-legislature, as one of the justices has called it--reading  into the Constitution words and implications which are not there,  and which were never intended to be there.    We have, therefore, reached the point as a nation where we must  take action to save the Constitution from the Court and the Court  from itself.  We must find a way to take an appeal from the Supreme  Court to the Constitution itself.  We want a Supreme Court which  will do justice under the Constitution--not over it.  In our courts  we want a government of laws and not of men.    I want--as all Americans want--an independent judiciary as proposed  by the framers of the Constitution.  That means a Supreme Court that  will enforce the Constitution as written--that will refuse to amend  the Constitution by the arbitrary exercise of judicial power--  amended by judicial say-so.  It does not mean a judiciary so  independent that it can deny the existence of facts which are  universally recognized.    How then could we proceed to perform the mandate given us?  It was  said in last year's Democratic platform, \"If these problems cannot  be effectively solved within the Constitution, we shall seek such  clarifying amendment as will assure the power to enact those laws,  adequately to regulate commerce, protect public health and safety,  and safeguard economic security.\"  In other words, we said we would  seek an amendment only if every other possible means by legislation  were to fail.    When I commenced to review the situation with the problem squarely  before me, I came by a process of elimination to the conclusion  that, short of amendments, the only method which was clearly  constitutional, and would at the same time carry out other much  needed reforms, was to infuse new blood into all our courts.  We  must have men worthy and equipped to carry out impartial justice.  But, at the same time, we must have judges who will bring to the  courts a present-day sense of the Constitution--judges who will  retain in the courts the judicial functions of a court, and reject  the legislative powers which the courts have today assumed.    In forty-five out of the forty-eight states of the Union, judges  are chosen not for life but for a period of years.  In many states  judges must retire at the age of seventy.  Congress has provided  financial security by offering life pensions at full pay for  federal judges on all courts who are willing to retire at seventy.  In the case of Supreme Court justices, that pension is $20,000 a  year.  But all federal judges, once appointed, can, if they choose,  hold office for life, no matter how old they may get to be.    What is my proposal?  It is simply this:  whenever a judge or justice  of any federal court has reached the age of seventy and does not  avail himself of the opportunity to retire on a pension, a new  member shall be appointed by the President then in office, with the  approval, as required by the Constitution, of the Senate of the  United States.    That plan has two chief purposes.  By bringing into the judicial  system a steady and continuing stream of new and younger blood, I  hope, first, to make the administration of all federal justice  speedier and, therefore, less costly; secondly, to bring to the  decision of social and economic problems younger men who have had  personal experience and contact with modern facts and circumstances  under which average men have to live and work.  This plan will save  our national Constitution from hardening of the judicial arteries.    The number of judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the  decision of present judges now over seventy, or those who would  subsequently reach the age of seventy.    If, for instance, any one of the six justices of the Supreme Court  now over the age of seventy should retire as provided under the  plan, no additional place would be created.  Consequently, although  there never can be more than fifteen, there may be only fourteen,  or thirteen, or twelve.  And there may be only nine.    There is nothing novel or radical about this idea.  It seeks to  maintain the federal bench in full vigor.  It has been discussed and  approved by many persons of high authority ever since a similar  proposal passed the House of Representatives in 1869.    Why was the age fixed at seventy?  Because the laws of many states,  the practice of the Civil Service, the regulations of the Army and  Navy, and the rules of many of our universities and of almost every  great private business enterprise, commonly fix the retirement age  at seventy years or less.    The statute would apply to all the courts in the federal system.  There is general approval so far as the lower federal courts are  concerned.  The plan has met opposition only so far as the Supreme  Court of the United States itself is concerned.  If such a plan is  good for the lower courts it certainly ought to be equally good for  the highest court from which there is no appeal.    Those opposing this plan have sought to arouse prejudice and fear  by crying that I am seeking to \"pack\" the Supreme Court and that a  baneful precedent will be established.    What do they mean by the words \"packing the Court\"?    Let me answer this question with a bluntness that will end all  _honest_ misunderstanding of my purposes.    If by that phrase \"packing the Court\" it is charged that I wish to  place on the bench spineless puppets who would disregard the law  and would decide specific cases as I wished them to be decided, I  make this answer:  that no President fit for his office would  appoint, and no Senate of honorable men fit for their office would  confirm, that kind of appointees to the Supreme Court.    But if by that phrase the charge is made that I would appoint and  the Senate would confirm justices worthy to sit beside present  members of the Court who understand those modern conditions, that I  will appoint justices who will not undertake to override the  judgment of the Congress on legislative policy, that I will appoint  justices who will act as justices and not as legislators--if the  appointment of such justices can be called \"packing the Courts,\"  then I say that I and with me the vast majority of the American  people favor doing just that thing--now.    Is it a dangerous precedent for the Congress to change the number  of the justices?  The Congress has always had, and will have, that  power.  The number of justices has been changed several times  before, in the administration of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson--  both signers of the Declaration of Independence--Andrew Jackson,  Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant.    I suggest only the addition of justices to the bench in accordance  with a clearly defined principle relating to a clearly defined age  limit.  Fundamentally, if in the future, America cannot trust the  Congress it elects to refrain from abuse of our Constitutional  usages, democracy will have failed far beyond the importance to it  of any king of precedent concerning the judiciary.    We think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous  judiciary that we encourage the retirement of elderly judges by  offering them a life pension at full salary.  Why then should we  leave the fulfillment of this public policy to chance or make  independent on upon the desire or prejudice of any individual  justice?    It is the clear intention of our public policy to provide for a  constant flow of new and younger blood into the judiciary.  Normally  every President appoints a large number of district and circuit  court judges and a few members of the Supreme Court.  Until my first  term practically every President of the United States has appointed  at least one member of the Supreme Court.  President Taft appointed  five members and named a Chief Justice; President Wilson, three;  President Harding, four, including a Chief Justice; President  Coolidge, one; President Hoover, three, including a Chief Justice.    Such a succession of appointments"]]]
