Before any optimistic economic  project can be accepted as feasible, we must examine  whether the physical conditions of production impose  an unalterable veto, or whether they are capable of  being sufficiently modified by science and organization.  Two connected doctrines must be considered  in examining this question: First, Malthus' doctrine  of population; and second, the vaguer, but very  prevalent, view that any surplus above the bare  necessaries of life can only be produced if most men  work long hours at monotonous or painful tasks,  leaving little leisure for a civilized existence or  rational enjoyment. I do not believe that either  of these obstacles to optimism will survive a close  scrutiny. The possibility of technical improvement  in the methods of production is, I believe, so  great that, at any rate for centuries to come, there  will be no inevitable barrier to progress in the general  well-being by the simultaneous increase of commodities  and diminution of hours of labor.    This subject has been specially studied by Kropotkin,  who, whatever may be thought of his general  theories of politics, is remarkably instructive, concrete  and convincing in all that he says about the  possibilities of agriculture. Socialists and Anarchists  in the main are products of industrial life, and  few among them have any practical knowledge on the  subject of food production. But Kropotkin is an  exception. His two books, ``The Conquest of Bread''  and ``Fields, Factories and Workshops,'' are very  full of detailed information, and, even making great  allowances for an optimistic bias, I do not think it  can be denied that they demonstrate possibilities in  which few of us would otherwise have believed.    Malthus contended, in effect, that population  always tends to increase up to the limit of subsistence,  that the production of food becomes more expensive  as its amount is increased, and that therefore, apart  from short exceptional periods when new discoveries  produce temporary alleviations, the bulk of mankind  must always be at the lowest level consistent with  survival and reproduction. As applied to the civilized  races of the world, this doctrine is becoming  untrue through the rapid decline in the birth-rate;  but, apart from this decline, there are many other  reasons why the doctrine cannot be accepted, at any  rate as regards the near future. The century which  elapsed after Malthus wrote, saw a very great  increase in the standard of comfort throughout the  wage-earning classes, and, owing to the enormous  increase in the productivity of labor, a far greater  rise in the standard of comfort could have been  effected if a more just system of distribution had  been introduced. In former times, when one man's  labor produced not very much more than was needed  for one man's subsistence, it was impossible either  greatly to reduce the normal hours of labor, or  greatly to increase the proportion of the population  who enjoyed more than the bare necessaries of life.  But this state of affairs has been overcome by modern  methods of production. At the present moment,  not only do many people enjoy a comfortable income  derived from rent or interest, but about half the  population of most of the civilized countries in the  world is engaged, not in the production of commodities,  but in fighting or in manufacturing munitions  of war. In a time of peace the whole of this  half might be kept in idleness without making the  other half poorer than they would have been if the  war had continued, and if, instead of being idle, they  were productively employed, the whole of what they  would produce would be a divisible surplus over and  above present wages. The present productivity of  labor in Great Britain would suffice to produce an  income of about 1 pound per day for each family, even  without any of those improvements in methods which  are obviously immediately possible.    But, it will be said, as population increases, the  price of food must ultimately increase also as  the sources of supply in Canada, the Argentine,  Australia and elsewhere are more and more used up.  There must come a time, so pessimists will urge, when  food becomes so dear that the ordinary wage-earner  will have little surplus for expenditure upon other  things. It may be admitted that this would be true  in some very distant future if the population were to  continue to increase without limit. If the whole  surface of the world were as densely populated as  London is now, it would, no doubt, require almost  the whole labor of the population to produce the  necessary food from the few spaces remaining for  agriculture. But there is no reason to suppose that  the population will continue to increase indefinitely,  and in any case the prospect is so remote that it may  be ignored in all practical considerations.    Returning from these dim speculations to the  facts set forth by Kropotkin, we find it proved in  his writings that, by methods of intensive cultivation,  which are already in actual operation, the amount of  food produced on a given area can be increased far  beyond anything that most uninformed persons suppose  possible. Speaking of the market-gardeners in  Great Britain, in the neighborhood of Paris, and in  other places, he says:--      They have created a totally new agriculture. They  smile when we boast about the rotation system having  permitted us to take from the field one crop every year,  or four crops each three years, because their ambition is  to have six and nine crops from the very same plot of  land during the twelve months. They do not understand  our talk about good and bad soils, because they make  the soil themselves, and make it in such quantities as to  be compelled yearly to sell some of it; otherwise it would  raise up the level of their gardens by half an inch every  year. They aim at cropping, not five or six tons of  grass on the acre, as we do, but from 50 to 100 tons of  various vegetables on the same space; not 5 pound sworth of  hay, but 100 pounds worth of vegetables, of the plainest description,  cabbage and carrots.[38]      [38] Kropotkin, ``Fields, Factories and Workshops,'' p. 74.      As regards cattle, he mentions that Mr. Champion  at Whitby grows on each acre the food of two or  three head of cattle, whereas under ordinary high  farming it takes two or three acres to keep each head  of cattle in Great Britain. Even more astonishing  are the achievements of the Culture Maraicheres  round Paris. It is impossible to summarize these  achievements, but we may note the general  conclusion:--      There are now practical Maraichers who venture to  maintain that if all the food, animal and vegetable,  necessary for the 3,500,000 inhabitants of the Departments  of Seine and Seine-et-Oise had to be grown on  their own territory (3250 square miles), it could be  grown without resorting to any other methods of culture  than those already in use--methods already tested on a  large scale and proved successful.[39]      [39] Ib. p. 81.      It must be remembered that these two departments  include the whole population of Paris.    Kropotkin proceeds to point out methods by  which the same result could be achieved without long  hours of labor. Indeed, he contends that the great  bulk of agricultural work could be carried on by  people whose main occupations are sedentary, and  with only such a number of hours as would serve to  keep them in health and produce a pleasant diversification.  He protests against the theory of exces-  sive division of labor. What he wants is INTEGRATION,  ``a society where each individual is a producer of  both manual and intellectual work; where each able-  bodied human being is a worker, and where each  worker works both in the field and in the industrial  workshop.''[40]      [40] Kropotkin, ``Field, Factories, and Workshops,'' p. 6.      These views as to production have no essential  connection with Kropotkin's advocacy of Anarchism.  They would be equally possible under State  Socialism, and under certain circumstances they  might even be carried out in a capitalistic regime.  They are important for our present purpose, not  from any argument which they afford in favor of one  economic system as against another, but from the  fact that they remove the veto upon our hopes which  might otherwise result from a doubt as to the productive  capacity of labor. I have dwelt upon agriculture  rather than industry, since it is in regard  to agriculture that the difficulties are chiefly supposed  to arise. Broadly speaking, industrial production  tends to be cheaper when it is carried on on  a large scale, and therefore there is no reason in  industry why an increase in the demand should lead  to an increased cost of supply.    Passing now from the purely technical and material  side of the problem of production, we come  to the human factor, the motives leading men to  work, the possibilities of efficient organization of  production, and the connection of production with  distribution. Defenders of the existing system  maintain that efficient work would be impossible without  the economic stimulus, and that if the wage  system were abolished men would cease to do enough  work to keep the community in tolerable comfort.  Through the alleged necessity of the economic motive,  the problems of production and distribution  become intertwined. The desire for a more just  distribution of the world's goods is the main inspiration  of most Socialism and Anarchism. We must,  therefore, consider whether the system of distribution  which they propose would be likely to lead to  a diminished production.    There is a fundamental difference between Socialism  and Anarchism as regards the question of distribution.

I forget most of it.\"    He whistled a few bars.    \"That's a thing of Greig's,\" said Sheen.    \"You might play it tomorrow,\" said Bruce.    \"Rather. Of course I will.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Jack Bruce. \"Good night.\"    He turned the car, and vanished down the road. From the sound Sheen  judged that he was once more travelling at a higher rate of speed than  the local police would have approved.          XIV    A SKIRMISH      Upon consideration Sheen determined to see Linton about that small  matter of the boat without delay. After prayers that night he went to  his study.    \"Can I speak to you for a minute, Linton?\" he said.    Linton was surprised. He disapproved of this intrusion. When a fellow  is being cut by the house, he ought, by all the laws of school  etiquette, to behave as such, and not speak till he is spoken to.    \"What do you want?\" asked Linton.    \"I shan't keep you long. Do you think you could put away that book for  a minute, and listen?\"    Linton hesitated, then shut the book.    \"Hurry up, then,\" he said.    \"I was going to,\" said Sheen. \"I simply came in to tell you that I know  perfectly well who sunk my boat this afternoon.\"    He felt at once that he had now got Linton's undivided attention.    \"Your boat!\" said Linton. \"You don't mean to say that was yours! What  on earth were you doing at the place?\"    \"I don't think that's any business of yours, is it, Linton?\"    \"How did you get back?\"    \"I don't think that's any business of yours, either. I daresay you're  disappointed, but I did manage to get back. In time for lock-up, too.\"    \"But I don't understand. Do you mean to say that that was your boat we  took?\"    \"Sunk,\" corrected Sheen.    \"Don't be a fool, Sheen. What the dickens should we want to sink your  boat for? What happened was this. Albert--you remember Albert?--followed  us up to the inn, and smashed our boat while we were having tea. When  we got out and found it sunk, we bagged the only other one we could  see. We hadn't a notion it was yours. We thought it belonged to some  fisherman chap.\"    \"Then you didn't sink my boat?\"    \"Of course we didn't. What do you take us for?\"    \"Sorry,\" said Sheen. \"I thought it was a queer thing for you to have  done. I'm glad it wasn't you. Good night.\"    \"But look here,\" said Linton, \"don't go. It must have landed you in a  frightful hole, didn't it?\"    \"A little. But it doesn't matter. Good night.\"    \"But half a second, Sheen--\"    Sheen had disappeared.    Linton sat on till lights were turned off, ruminating. He had a very  tender conscience where other members of the school were concerned,  though it was tougher as regarded masters; and he was full of remorse  at the thought of how nearly he had got Sheen into trouble by borrowing  his boat that afternoon. It seemed to him that it was his duty to make  it up to him in some way.    It was characteristic of Linton that the episode did not, in any way,  alter his attitude towards Sheen. Another boy in a similar position  might have become effusively friendly. Linton looked on the affair in a  calm, judicial spirit. He had done Sheen a bad turn, but that was no  reason why he should fling himself on his neck and swear eternal  friendship. His demeanour on the occasions when they came in contact  with each other remained the same. He did not speak to him, and he did  not seem to see him. But all the while he was remembering that somehow  or other he must do him a good turn of some sort, by way of levelling  things up again. When that good turn had been done, he might dismiss  him from his thoughts altogether.    Sheen, for his part, made no attempt to trade on the matter of the  boat. He seemed as little anxious to be friendly with Linton as Linton  was to be friendly with him. For this Linton was grateful, and  continued to keep his eyes open in the hope of finding some opportunity  of squaring up matters between them.    His chance was not long in coming. The feeling in the house against  Sheen, caused by the story of his encounter with Attell, had not  diminished. Stanning had fostered it in various little ways. It was not  difficult. When a house of the standing in the school which Seymour's  possessed exhibits a weak spot, the rest of the school do not require a  great deal of encouragement to go on prodding that weak spot. In short,  the school rotted Seymour's about Sheen, and Seymour's raged  impotently. Fags of other houses expended much crude satire on  Seymour's fags, and even the seniors of the house came in for their  share of the baiting. Most of the houses at Wrykyn were jealous of  Seymour's, and this struck them as an admirable opportunity of getting  something of their own back.    One afternoon, not long after Sheen's conversation with Linton,  Stanning came into Seymour's senior day-room and sat down on the table.  The senior day-room objected to members of other houses coming and  sitting on their table as if they had bought that rickety piece of  furniture; but Stanning's reputation as a bruiser kept their resentment  within bounds.    \"Hullo, you chaps,\" said Stanning.    The members of the senior day-room made no reply, but continued, as Mr  Kipling has it, to persecute their vocations. Most of them were  brewing. They went on brewing with the earnest concentration of  _chefs_.    \"You're a cheery lot,\" said Stanning. \"But I don't wonder you've got  the hump. I should be a bit sick if we'd got a skunk like that in our  house. Heard the latest?\"    Some lunatic said, \"No. What?\" thereby delivering the day-room bound  into the hands of the enemy.    \"Sheen's apologised to Attell.\"    There was a sensation in the senior day-room, as Stanning had expected.  He knew his men. He was perfectly aware that any story which centred  round Sheen's cowardice would be believed by them, so he had not  troubled to invent a lie which it would be difficult to disprove. He  knew that in the present state of feeling in the house Sheen would not  be given a hearing.    \"No!\" shouted the senior day-room.    This was the last straw. The fellow seemed to go out of his way to  lower the prestige of the house.    \"Fact,\" said Stanning. \"I thought you knew.\"    He continued to sit on the table, swinging his legs, while the full  horror of his story sunk into the senior day-room mind.    \"I wonder you don't do something about it. Why don't you touch him up?  He's not a prefect.\"    But they were not prepared to go to that length. The senior day-room  had a great respect both for Drummond's word and his skill with his  hands. He had said he would slay any one who touched Sheen, and they  were of opinion that he would do it.    \"He isn't in,\" said one of the brewers, looking up from his  toasting-fork. \"His study door was open when I passed.\"    \"I say, why not rag his study?\" suggested another thickly, through a  mouthful of toast.    Stanning smiled.    \"Good idea,\" he said.    It struck him that some small upheaval of Sheen's study furniture,  coupled with the burning of one or two books, might check to some  extent that student's work for the Gotford. And if Sheen could be  stopped working for the Gotford, he, Stanning, would romp home. In the  matter of brilliance there was no comparison between them. It was  Sheen's painful habit of work which made him dangerous.    Linton had been listening to this conversation in silence. He had come  to the senior day-room to borrow a book. He now slipped out, and made  his way to Drummond's study.    Drummond was in. Linton proceeded to business.    \"I say, Drummond.\"    \"Hullo?\"    \"That man Stanning has come in. He's getting the senior day-room to rag  Sheen's study.\"    \"What!\"    Linton repeated his statement.    \"Does the man think he owns the house?\" said Drummond. \"Where is he?\"    \"Coming up now. I hear them. What are you going to do? Stop them?\"    \"What do you think? Of course I am. I'm not going to have any of  Appleby's crew coming into Seymour's and ragging studies.\"    \"This ought to be worth seeing,\" said Linton. \"Look on me as 'Charles,  his friend'. I'll help if you want me, but it's your scene.\"    Drummond opened his door just as Stanning and his myrmidons were  passing it.    \"Hullo, Stanning,\" he said.    Stanning turned. The punitive expedition stopped.    \"Do you want anything?\" inquired Drummond politely.    The members of the senior day-room who were with Stanning rallied round,  silent and interested. This dramatic situation appealed to them. They  had a passion for rows, and this looked distinctly promising.    There was a pause. Stanning looked carefully at Drummond. Drummond  looked carefully at Stanning.    \"I was going to see Sheen,\" said Stanning at length.    \"He isn't in.\"    \"Oh!\"    Another pause.    \"Was it anything special?\" inquired Drummond pleasantly.    The expedition edged a little forward.    \"No. Oh, no. Nothing special,\" said Stanning.    The expedition looked disappointed.    \"Any message I can give him?\" asked Drummond.    \"No, thanks,\" said Stanning.    \"Sure?\"    \"Quite, thanks.\"    \"I don't think it's worth while your waiting. He may not be in for some  time.\"    \"No, perhaps not. Thanks. So long.\"    \"So long.\"    Stanning turned on his heel, and walked away down the passage. Drummond  went back into his study, and shut the door.    The expedition, deprived of its commander-in-chief, paused irresolutely  outside. Then it followed its leader's example.    There was peace in the passage.          XV    THE ROUT AT RIPTON      On the Saturday following this episode, the first fifteen travelled to  Ripton to play the return match with that school on its own ground. Of  the two Ripton matches, the one played at Wrykyn was always the big  event of the football year; but the other came next in importance, and  the telegram which was despatched to the school shop at the close of  the game was always awaited with anxiety.
