Now I had thought the crab we had tried to capture before coming to the  island, a prodigy unsurpassed; but this creature was more than treble its  size, seeming as though a prodigious table were a-chase of them, and  moreover, spite of its monstrous bulk, it made better way over the weed  than I should have conceived to be possible--running almost sideways, and  with one enormous claw raised near a dozen feet into the air.    Now whether, omitting accidents, the men would have made good their  escape to the firmer ground of the valley, where they could have attained  to a greater speed, I do not know; but suddenly one of them tripped over  a loop of the weed, and the next instant lay helpless upon his face. He  had been dead the following moment, but for the pluck of his companion,  who faced round manfully upon the monster, and ran at it with his  twenty-foot spear. It seemed to me that the spear took it about a foot  below the overhanging armor of the great back shell, and I could see  that it penetrated some distance into the creature, the man having, by  the aid of Providence, stricken it in a vulnerable part. Upon receiving  this thrust, the mighty crab ceased at once its pursuit, and clipped at  the haft of the spear with its great mandible, snapping the weapon more  easily than I had done the same thing to a straw. By the time we had  raced up to the men, the one who had stumbled was again upon his feet,  and turning to assist his comrade; but the bo'sun snatched his spear from  him, and leapt forward himself; for the crab was making now at the other  man. Now the bo'sun did not attempt to thrust the spear into the monster;  but instead he made two swift blows at the great protruding eyes, and in  a moment the creature had curled itself up, helpless, save that the huge  claw waved about aimlessly. At that, the bo'sun drew us off, though the  man who had attacked the crab desired to make an end of it, averring that  we should get some very good eating out of it; but to this the bo'sun  would not listen, telling him that it was yet capable of very deadly  mischief, did any but come within reach of its prodigious mandible.    And after this, he bade them look no more for shellfish; but take out the  two fishing-lines which we had, and see if they could catch aught from  some safe ledge on the further side of the hill upon which we had made  our camp. Then he returned to his mending of the boat.    It was a little before the evening came down upon the island, that the  bo'sun ceased work; and, after that, he called to the men, who, having  made an end of their fuel carrying, were standing near, to place the  full breakers--which we had not thought needful to carry to the new  camp on account of their weight--under the upturned boat, some holding  up the gunnel whilst the others pushed them under. Then the bo'sun laid  the unfinished batten along with them, and we lowered the boat again  over all, trusting to its weight to prevent any creature from meddling  with aught.    After that, we made at once to the camp, being wearifully tired, and with  a hearty anticipation of supper. Upon reaching the hilltop, the men whom  the bo'sun had sent with the lines, came to show him a very fine fish,  something like to a huge king-fish, which they had caught a few minutes  earlier. This, the bo'sun, after examining, did not hesitate to pronounce  fit for food; whereupon they set-to and opened and cleaned it. Now, as I  have said, it was not unlike a great king-fish, and like it, had a mouth  full of very formidable teeth; the use of which I understood the better  when I saw the contents of its stomach, which seemed to consist of  nothing but the coiled tentacles of squid or cuttlefish, with which, as I  have shown, the weed-continent swarmed. When these were upset upon the  rock, I was confounded to perceive the length and thickness of some of  them; and could only conceive that this particular fish must be a very  desperate enemy to them, and able successfully to attack monsters of a  bulk infinitely greater than its own.    After this, and whilst the supper was preparing, the bo'sun called to  some of the men to put up a piece of the spare canvas upon a couple of  the reeds, so as to make a screen against the wind, which up there was  so fresh that it came near at times to scattering the fire abroad. This  they found not difficult; for a little on the windward side of the fire  there ran one of the cracks of which I have made previous mention, and  into this they jammed the supports, and so in a very little time had the  fire screened.    Presently, the supper was ready, and I found the fish to be very fair  eating; though somewhat coarse; but this was no great matter for concern  with so empty a stomach as I contained. And here I would remark, that we  made our fishing save our provisions through all our stay on the island.  Then, after we had come to an end of our eating, we lay down to a most  comfortable smoke; for we had no fear of attack, at that height, and with  precipices upon all sides save that which lay in front. Yet, so soon as  we had rested and smoked a while, the bo'sun set the watches; for he  would run no risk through carelessness.    By this time the night was drawing on apace; yet it was not so dark but  that one could perceive matters at a very reasonable distance. Presently,  being in a mood that tended to thoughtfulness, and feeling a desire to be  alone for a little, I strolled away from the fire to the leeward edge of  the hilltop. Here, I paced up and down awhile, smoking and meditating.  Anon, I would stare out across the immensity of the vast continent of  weed and slime that stretched its incredible desolation out beyond the  darkening horizon, and there would come the thought to me of the terror  of men whose vessels had been entangled among its strange growths, and so  my thoughts came to the lone derelict that lay out there in the dusk, and  I fell to wondering what had been the end of her people, and at that I  grew yet more solemn in my heart. For it seemed to me that they must have  died at last by starvation, and if not by that, then by the act of some  one of the devil-creatures which inhabited that lonely weed-world. And  then, even as I fell upon this thought, the bo'sun clapped me upon the  shoulder, and told me in a very hearty way to come to the light of the  fire, and banish all melancholy thoughts; for he had a very penetrating  discernment, and had followed me quietly from the camping place, having  had reason once or twice before to chide me for gloomy meditations. And  for this, and many other matters, I had grown to like the man, the which  I could almost believe at times, was his regarding of me; but his words  were too few for me to gather his feelings; though I had hope that they  were as I surmised.    And so I came back to the fire, and presently, it not being my time to  watch until after midnight, I turned into the tent for a spell of sleep,  having first arranged a comfortable spread of some of the softer portions  of the dry weed to make me a bed.    Now I was very full of sleep, so that I slept heavily, and in this wise  heard not the man on watch call the bo'sun; yet the rousing of the others  waked me, and so I came to myself and found the tent empty, at which I  ran very hurriedly to the doorway, and so discovered that there was a  clear moon in the sky, the which, by reason of the cloudiness that had  prevailed, we had been without for the past two nights. Moreover, the  sultriness had gone, the wind having blown it away with the clouds; yet  though, maybe, I appreciated this, it was but in a half-conscious manner;  for I was put about to discover the whereabouts of the men, and the  reason of their leaving the tent. With this purpose, I stepped out from  the entrance, and the following instant discovered them all in a clump  beside the leeward edge of the hilltop. At that, I held my tongue; for I  knew not but that silence might be their desire; but I ran hastily over  to them, and inquired of the bo'sun what manner of thing it was which  called them from their sleep, and he, for answer, pointed out into the  greatness of the weed-continent.    At that, I stared out over the breadth of the weed, showing very ghostly  in the moonlight; but, for the moment, I saw not the thing to which he  purposed to draw my attention. Then, suddenly, it fell within the circle  of my gaze--a little light out in the lonesomeness. For the space of some  moments, I stared with bewildered eyes; then it came to me with  abruptness that the light shone from the lone derelict lying out in the  weed, the same that upon that very evening, I had looked with sorrow and  awe, because of the end of those who had been in her--and now, behold, a  light burning, seemingly within one of her after cabins; though the moon  was scarce powerful enough to enable the outline of the hulk to be seen  clear of the rounding wilderness.    And from this time, until the day, we had no more sleep; but made up the  fire, and sat round it, full of excitement and wonder, and getting up  continually to discover if the light still burned. This it ceased to do  about an hour after I had first seen it; but it was the more proof that  some of our kind were no more than the half of a mile from our camp.    And at last the day came.          XI    The Signals from the Ship      Now so soon as it was clearly light, we went all of us to the leeward  brow of the hill to stare upon the derelict, which now we had cause to  believe no derelict, but an inhabited vessel. Yet though we watched her  for upwards of two hours, we could discover no sign of any living  creature, the which, indeed, had we been in cooler minds, we had not  thought strange, seeing that she was all so shut in by the great  superstructure; but we were hot to see a fellow creature, after so much  lonesomeness and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554"],[0,"Right Ho, Jeeves (#16)"],[1,"potatoes always induces a sort of  prickly sensation and a hideous feeling of shame, together with a marked  starting of the pores.    I remember at my Aunt Agatha's place in Hertfordshire once being put on  the spot and forced to enact the role of King Edward III saying goodbye  to that girl of his, Fair Rosamund, at some sort of pageant in aid of the  Distressed Daughters of the Clergy. It involved some rather warmish  medieval dialogue, I recall, racy of the days when they called a spade a  spade, and by the time the whistle blew, I'll bet no Daughter of the  Clergy was half as distressed as I was. Not a dry stitch.    My reaction now was very similar. It was a highly liquid Bertram who,  hearing his _vis-a-vis_ give a couple of hiccups and start to speak bent  an attentive ear.    \"Please don't say any more, Mr. Wooster.\"    Well, I wasn't going to, of course.    \"I understand.\"    I was glad to hear this.    \"Yes, I understand. I won't be so silly as to pretend not to know what  you mean. I suspected this at Cannes, when you used to stand and stare at  me without speaking a word, but with whole volumes in your eyes.\"    If Angela's shark had bitten me in the leg, I couldn't have leaped more  convulsively. So tensely had I been concentrating on Gussie's interests  that it hadn't so much as crossed my mind that another and an unfortunate  construction could be placed on those words of mine. The persp., already  bedewing my brow, became a regular Niagara.    My whole fate hung upon a woman's word. I mean to say, I couldn't back  out. If a girl thinks a man is proposing to her, and on that  understanding books him up, he can't explain to her that she has got hold  of entirely the wrong end of the stick and that he hadn't the smallest  intention of suggesting anything of the kind. He must simply let it ride.  And the thought of being engaged to a girl who talked openly about  fairies being born because stars blew their noses, or whatever it was,  frankly appalled me.    She was carrying on with her remarks, and as I listened I clenched my  fists till I shouldn't wonder if the knuckles didn't stand out white  under the strain. It seemed as if she would never get to the nub.    \"Yes, all through those days at Cannes I could see what you were trying  to say. A girl always knows. And then you followed me down here, and  there was that same dumb, yearning look in your eyes when we met this  evening. And then you were so insistent that I should come out and walk  with you in the twilight. And now you stammer out those halting words.  No, this does not come as a surprise. But I am sorry----\"    The word was like one of Jeeves's pick-me-ups. Just as if a glassful of  meat sauce, red pepper, and the yolk of an egg--though, as I say, I am  convinced that these are not the sole ingredients--had been shot into me,  I expanded like some lovely flower blossoming in the sunshine. It was all  right, after all. My guardian angel had not been asleep at the switch.    \"--but I am afraid it is impossible.\"    She paused.    \"Impossible,\" she repeated.    I had been so busy feeling saved from the scaffold that I didn't get on  to it for a moment that an early reply was desired.    \"Oh, right ho,\" I said hastily.    \"I'm sorry.\"    \"Quite all right.\"    \"Sorrier than I can say.\"    \"Don't give it another thought.\"    \"We can still be friends.\"    \"Oh, rather.\"    \"Then shall we just say no more about it; keep what has happened as a  tender little secret between ourselves?\"    \"Absolutely.\"    \"We will. Like something lovely and fragrant laid away in lavender.\"    \"In lavender--right.\"    There was a longish pause. She was gazing at me in a divinely pitying  sort of way, much as if I had been a snail she had happened accidentally  to bring her short French vamp down on, and I longed to tell her that it  was all right, and that Bertram, so far from being the victim of despair,  had never felt fizzier in his life. But, of course, one can't do that  sort of thing. I simply said nothing, and stood there looking brave.    \"I wish I could,\" she murmured.    \"Could?\" I said, for my attensh had been wandering.    \"Feel towards you as you would like me to feel.\"    \"Oh, ah.\"    \"But I can't. I'm sorry.\"    \"Absolutely O.K. Faults on both sides, no doubt.\"    \"Because I am fond of you, Mr.--no, I think I must call you Bertie. May  I?\"    \"Oh, rather.\"    \"Because we are real friends.\"    \"Quite.\"    \"I do like you, Bertie. And if things were different--I wonder----\"    \"Eh?\"    \"After all, we are real friends.... We have this common memory.... You  have a right to know.... I don't want you to think----Life is such a  muddle, isn't it?\"    To many men, no doubt, these broken utterances would have appeared mere  drooling and would have been dismissed as such. But the Woosters are  quicker-witted than the ordinary and can read between the lines. I  suddenly divined what it was that she was trying to get off the chest.    \"You mean there's someone else?\"    She nodded.    \"You're in love with some other bloke?\"    She nodded.    \"Engaged, what?\"    This time she shook the pumpkin.    \"No, not engaged.\"    Well, that was something, of course. Nevertheless, from the way she  spoke, it certainly looked as if poor old Gussie might as well scratch  his name off the entry list, and I didn't at all like the prospect of  having to break the bad news to him. I had studied the man closely, and  it was my conviction that this would about be his finish.    Gussie, you see, wasn't like some of my pals--the name of Bingo Little is  one that springs to the lips--who, if turned down by a girl, would simply  say, \"Well, bung-oh!\" and toddle off quite happily to find another. He  was so manifestly a bird who, having failed to score in the first  chukker, would turn the thing up and spend the rest of his life brooding  over his newts and growing long grey whiskers, like one of those chaps  you read about in novels, who live in the great white house you can just  see over there through the trees and shut themselves off from the world  and have pained faces.    \"I'm afraid he doesn't care for me in that way. At least, he has said  nothing. You understand that I am only telling you this because----\"    \"Oh, rather.\"    \"It's odd that you should have asked me if I believed in love at first  sight.\" She half closed her eyes. \"'Who ever loved that loved not at  first sight?'\" she said in a rummy voice that brought back to me--I don't  know why--the picture of my Aunt Agatha, as Boadicea, reciting at that  pageant I was speaking of. \"It's a silly little story. I was staying with  some friends in the country, and I had gone for a walk with my dog, and  the poor wee mite got a nasty thorn in his little foot and I didn't know  what to do. And then suddenly this man came along----\"    Harking back once again to that pageant, in sketching out for you my  emotions on that occasion, I showed you only the darker side of the  picture. There was, I should now mention, a splendid aftermath when,  having climbed out of my suit of chain mail and sneaked off to the local  pub, I entered the saloon bar and requested mine host to start pouring. A  moment later, a tankard of their special home-brewed was in my hand, and  the ecstasy of that first gollup is still green in my memory. The  recollection of the agony through which I had passed was just what was  needed to make it perfect.    It was the same now. When I realized, listening to her words, that she  must be referring to Gussie--I mean to say, there couldn't have been a  whole platoon of men taking thorns out of her dog that day; the animal  wasn't a pin-cushion--and became aware that Gussie, who an instant before  had, to all appearances, gone so far back in the betting as not to be  worth a quotation, was the big winner after all, a positive thrill  permeated the frame and there escaped my lips a \"Wow!\" so crisp and  hearty that the Bassett leaped a liberal inch and a half from terra  firma.    \"I beg your pardon?\" she said.    I waved a jaunty hand.    \"Nothing,\" I said. \"Nothing. Just remembered there's a letter I have to  write tonight without fail. If you don't mind, I think I'll be going in.  Here,\" I said, \"comes Gussie Fink-Nottle. He will look after you.\"    And, as I spoke, Gussie came sidling out from behind a tree.    I passed away and left them to it. As regards these two, everything was  beyond a question absolutely in order. All Gussie had to do was keep his  head down and not press. Already, I felt, as I legged it back to the  house, the happy ending must have begun to function. I mean to say, when  you leave a girl and a man, each of whom has admitted in set terms that  she and he loves him and her, in close juxtaposition in the twilight,  there doesn't seem much more to do but start pricing fish slices.    Something attempted, something done, seemed to me to have earned  two-penn'orth of wassail in the smoking-room.    I proceeded thither.        -11-      The makings were neatly laid out on a side-table, and to pour into a  glass an inch or so of the raw spirit and shoosh some soda-water on top  of it was with me the work of a moment. This done, I retired to an  arm-chair and put my feet up, sipping the mixture with carefree enjoyment,  rather like Caesar having one in his tent the day he overcame the Nervii.    As I let the mind dwell on what must even now be taking place in that  peaceful garden, I felt bucked and uplifted. Though never for an instant  faltering in my opinion that Augustus Fink-Nottle was Nature's final word  in cloth-headed guffins, I liked the man, wished him well, and could not  have felt more deeply involved in the success of his wooing if I, and not  he, had been under the ether.    The thought that by this time he might quite easily have completed the  preliminary _pourparlers_ and be deep in an informal discussion of  honeymoon plans was very pleasant to me.    Of course,"]]]
