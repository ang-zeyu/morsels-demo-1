'At whom, then, _did_ you look?'  said Tigranes. 'At him who said that, to save me from servitude, he  would ransom me at the expense of his own life.'\"    From the Banquet.--    \"Socrates, who observed her with pleasure, said, 'This young girl has  confirmed me in the opinion I have had, for a long time, that the  female sex are nothing inferior to ours, excepting only in strength of  body, or, perhaps, his steadiness of judgment.'\"           *       *       *       *       *    In the Economics, the manner in which the husband gives counsel to his  young wife presents the model of politeness and refinement. Xenophon  is thoroughly the gentleman; gentle in breeding and in soul. All the  men he describes are so, while the shades of manner are distinctly  marked. There is the serene dignity of Socrates, with gleams of  playfulness thrown across its cool, religious shades, the princely  mildness of Cyrus, and the more domestic elegance of the husband in  the Economics.    There is no way that men sin more against refinement, as well as  discretion, than in their conduct toward their wives. Let them look at  the men of Xenophon. Such would know how to give counsel, for they  would know how to receive it. They would feel that the most intimate  relations claimed most, not least, of refined courtesy. They would not  suppose that confidence justified carelessness, nor the reality of  affection want of delicacy in the expression of it.    Such men would be too wise to hide their affairs from the wife, and  then expect her to act as if she knew them. They would know that, if  she is expected to face calamity with courage, she must be instructed  and trusted in prosperity, or, if they had failed in wise confidence,  such as the husband shows in the Economics, they would be ashamed of  anger or querulous surprise at the results that naturally follow.    Such men would not be exposed to the bad influence of bad wives; for  all wives, bad or good, loved or unloved, inevitably influence their  husbands, from the power their position not merely gives, but  necessitates, of coloring evidence and infusing feelings in hours when  the--patient, shall I call him?--is off his guard. Those who  understand the wife's mind, and think it worth while to respect her  springs of action, know bettor where they are. But to the bad or  thoughtless man, who lives carelessly and irreverently so near another  mind, the wrong he does daily back upon himself recoils. A Cyrus, an  Abradatus, knows where he stands.           *       *       *       *       *    But to return to the thread of my subject.    Another sign of the times is furnished by the triumphs of Female  Authorship. These have been great, and are constantly increasing.  Women have taken possession of so many provinces for which men had  pronounced them unfit, that, though these still declare there are some  inaccessible to them, it is difficult to say just _where_ they  must stop.    The shining names of famous women have cast light upon the path of the  sex, and many obstructions have been removed. When a Montague could  learn better than her brother, and use her lore afterwards to such  purpose as an observer, it seemed amiss to hinder women from preparing  themselves to see, or from seeing all they could, when prepared. Since  Somerville has achieved so much, will any young girl be prevented from  seeking a knowledge of the physical sciences, if she wishes it? De  Stael's name was not so clear of offence; she could not forget the  Woman in the thought; while she was instructing you as a mind, she  wished to be admired as a Woman; sentimental tears often dimmed the  eagle glance. Her intellect, too, with all its splendor, trained in a  drawing-room, fed on flattery, was tainted and flawed; yet its beams  make the obscurest school-house in New England warmer and lighter to  the little rugged girls who are gathered together on its wooden bench.  They may never through life hear her name, but she is not the less  their benefactress.    The influence has been such, that the aim certainly is, now, in  arranging school instruction for girls, to give them as fair a field  as boys. As yet, indeed, these arrangements are made with little  judgment or reflection; just as the tutors of Lady Jane Grey, and  other distinguished women of her time, taught them Latin and Greek,  because they knew nothing else themselves, so now the improvement in  the education of girls is to be made by giving them young men as  teachers, who only teach what has been taught themselves at college,  while methods and topics need revision for these new subjects, which  could better be made by those who had experienced the same wants.  Women are, often, at the head of these institutions; but they have, as  yet, seldom been thinking women, capable of organizing a new whole for  the wants of the time, and choosing persons to officiate in the  departments. And when some portion of instruction of a good sort is  got from the school, the far greater proportion which is infused from  the general atmosphere of society contradicts its purport. Yet books  and a little elementary instruction are not furnished in vain. Women  are better aware how great and rich the universe is, not so easily  blinded by narrowness or partial views of a home circle. \"Her mother  did so before her\" is no longer a sufficient excuse. Indeed, it was  never received as an excuse to mitigate the severity of censure, but  was adduced as a reason, rather, why there should be no effort made  for reformation.    Whether much or little has been done, or will be done,--whether women  will add to the talent of narration the power of systematizing,--whether  they  will carve marble, as well as draw and paint,--is not important.  But that it should be acknowledged that they have intellect which needs  developing--that they should not be considered complete, if beings of  affection and habit alone--is important.    Yet even this acknowledgment, rather conquered by Woman than proffered  by Man, has been sullied by the usual selfishness. Too much is said of  women being better educated, that they may become better companions  and mothers _for_ men. They should be fit for such companionship,  and we have mentioned, with satisfaction, instances where it has been  established. Earth knows no fairer, holier relation than that of a  mother. It is one which, rightly understood, must both promote and  require the highest attainments. But a being of infinite scope must  not be treated with an exclusive view to any one relation. Give the  soul free course, let the organization, both of body and mind, be  freely developed, and the being will be fit for any and every relation  to which it may be called. The intellect, no more than the sense of  hearing, is to be cultivated merely that Woman may be a more valuable  companion to Man, but because the Power who gave a power, by its mere  existence signifies that it must be brought out toward perfection.    In this regard of self-dependence, and a greater simplicity and  fulness of being, we must hail as a preliminary the increase of the  class contemptuously designated as \"old maids.\"    We cannot wonder at the aversion with which old bachelors and old  maids have been regarded. Marriage is the natural means of forming a  sphere, of taking root in the earth; it requires more strength to do  this without such an opening; very many have failed, and their  imperfections have been in every one's way. They have been more  partial, more harsh, more officious and impertinent, than those  compelled by severer friction to render themselves endurable. Those  who have a more full experience of the instincts have a distrust as to  whether the unmarried can be thoroughly human and humane, such as is  hinted in the saying, \"Old-maids' and bachelors' children are well  cared for,\" which derides at once their ignorance and their  presumption.    Yet the business of society has become so complex, that it could now  scarcely be carried on without the presence of these despised  auxiliaries; and detachments from the army of aunts and uncles are  wanted to stop gaps in every hedge. They rove about, mental and moral  Ishmaelites, pitching their tents amid the fixed and ornamented homes  of men.    In a striking variety of forms, genius of late, both at home and  abroad, has paid its tribute to the character of the Aunt and the  Uncle, recognizing in these personages the spiritual parents, who have  supplied defects in the treatment of the busy or careless actual  parents.    They also gain a wider, if not so deep experience. Those who are not  intimately and permanently linked with others, are thrown upon  themselves; and, if they do not there find peace and incessant life,  there is none to flatter them that they are not very poor, and very  mean.    A position which so constantly admonishes, may be of inestimable  benefit. The person may gain, undistracted by other relationships, a  closer communion with the one. Such a use is made of it by saints and  sibyls. Or she may be one of the lay sisters of charity, a canoness,  bound by an inward vow,--or the useful drudge of all men, the Martha,  much sought, little prized,--or the intellectual interpreter of the  varied life she sees; the Urania of a half-formed world's twilight.    Or she may combine all these. Not needing to care that she may please  a husband, a frail and limited being, her thoughts may turn to the  centre, and she may, by steadfast contemplation entering into the  secret of truth and love, use it for the good of all men, instead of a  chosen few, and interpret through it all the forms of life. It is  possible, perhaps, to be at once a priestly servant and a loving muse.    Saints and geniuses have often chosen a lonely position, in the faith  that if, undisturbed by the pressure of near ties, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8649"],[0,"Indian Tales (#15)"],[1,"tling, thundering cages to come down and fly up again. But the  outworkings were very far off, and word could not be passed quickly,  though the heads of the gangs and the Assistant shouted and swore and  tramped and stumbled. The Manager kept one eye on the great troubled pool  behind the embankment, and prayed that the culvert would give way and let  the water through in time. With the other eye he watched the cages come up  and saw the headmen counting the roll of the gangs. With all his heart and  soul he swore at the winder who controlled the iron drum that wound up the  wire rope on which hung the cages.    In a little time there was a down-draw in the water behind the  embankment--a sucking whirlpool, all yellow and yeasty. The water had  smashed through the skin of the earth and was pouring into the old shallow  workings of Twenty-Two.    Deep down below, a rush of black water caught the last gang waiting for  the cage, and as they clambered in, the whirl was about their waists. The  cage reached the pit-bank, and the Manager called the roll. The gangs were  all safe except Gang Janki, Gang Mogul, and Gang Rahim, eighteen men, with  perhaps ten basket-women who loaded the coal into the little iron  carriages that ran on the tramways of the main galleries. These gangs were  in the out-workings, three-quarters of a mile away, on the extreme fringe  of the mine. Once more the cage went down, but with only two English men  in it, and dropped into a swirling, roaring current that had almost  touched the roof of some of the lower side-galleries. One of the wooden  balks with which they had propped the old workings shot past on the  current, just missing the cage.    \"If we don't want our ribs knocked out, we'd better go,\" said the Manager.  \"We can't even save the Company's props.\"    The cage drew out of the water with a splash, and a few minutes later, it  was officially reported that there were at least ten feet of water in the  pit's eye. Now ten feet of water there meant that all other places in the  mine were flooded except such galleries as were more than ten feet above  the level of the bottom of the shaft. The deep workings would be full, the  main galleries would be full, but in the high workings reached by inclines  from the main roads, there would be a certain amount of air cut off, so to  speak, by the water and squeezed up by it. The little science-primers  explain how water behaves when you pour it down test-tubes. The flooding  of Twenty-Two was an illustration on a large scale.             *         *         *         *         *    \"By the Holy Grove, what has happened to the air!\" It was a Sonthal  gangman of Gang Mogul in Number Nine gallery, and he was driving a  six-foot way through the coal. Then there was a rush from the other  galleries, and Gang Janki and Gang Rahim stumbled up with their  basket-women.    \"Water has come in the mine,\" they said, \"and there is no way of getting  out.\"    \"I went down,\" said Janki--\"down the slope of my gallery, and I felt the  water.\"    \"There has been no water in the cutting in our time,\" clamored the women,  \"Why cannot we go away?\"    \"Be silent!\" said Janki, \"Long ago, when my father was here, water came to  Ten--no, Eleven--cutting, and there was great trouble. Let us get away to  where the air is better.\"    The three gangs and the basket-women left Number Nine gallery and went  further up Number Sixteen. At one turn of the road they could see the  pitchy black water lapping on the coal. It had touched the roof of a  gallery that they knew well--a gallery where they used to smoke their  _huqas_ and manage their flirtations. Seeing this, they called aloud upon  their Gods, and the Mehas, who are thrice bastard Muhammadans, strove to  recollect the name of the Prophet. They came to a great open square whence  nearly all the coal had been extracted. It was the end of the  out-workings, and the end of the mine.    Far away down the gallery a small pumping-engine, used for keeping dry a  deep working and fed with steam from above, was throbbing faithfully. They  heard it cease.    \"They have cut off the steam,\" said Kundoo, hopefully. \"They have given  the order to use all the steam for the pit-bank pumps. They will clear out  the water.\"    \"If the water has reached the smoking-gallery,\" said Janki, \"all the  Company's pumps can do nothing for three days.\"    \"It is very hot,\" moaned Jasoda, the Meah basket-woman. \"There is a very  bad air here because of the lamps.\"    \"Put them out,\" said Janki; \"why do you want lamps?\" The lamps were put  out and the company sat still in the utter dark. Somebody rose quietly and  began walking over the coals. It was Janki, who was touching the walls  with his hands. \"Where is the ledge?\" he murmured to himself.    \"Sit, sit!\" said Kundoo. \"If we die, we die. The air is very bad.\"    But Janki still stumbled and crept and tapped with his pick upon the  walls. The women rose to their feet.    \"Stay all where you are. Without the lamps you cannot see, and I--I am  always seeing,\" said Janki. Then he paused, and called out: \"Oh, you who  have been in the cutting more than ten years, what is the name of this  open place? I am an old man and I have forgotten.\"    \"Bullia's Room,\" answered the Sonthal, who had complained of the vileness  of the air.    \"Again,\" said Janki.    \"Bullia's Room.\"    \"Then I have found it,\" said Janki. \"The name only had slipped my memory.  Tibu's gang's gallery is here.\"    \"A lie,\" said Kundoo. \"There have been no galleries in this place since my  day.\"    \"Three paces was the depth of the ledge,\" muttered Janki, without  heeding--\"and--oh, my poor bones!--I have found it! It is here, up this  ledge, Come all you, one by one, to the place of my voice, and I will  count you,\"    There was a rush in the dark, and Janki felt the first man's face hit his  knees as the Sonthal scrambled up the ledge.    \"Who?\" cried Janki.    \"I, Sunua Manji.\"    \"Sit you down,\" said Janki, \"Who next?\"    One by one the women and the men crawled up the ledge which ran along one  side of \"Bullia's Room.\" Degraded Muhammadan, pig-eating Musahr and wild  Sonthal, Janki ran his hand over them all.    \"Now follow after,\" said he, \"catching hold of my heel, and the women  catching the men's clothes.\" He did not ask whether the men had brought  their picks with them. A miner, black or white, does not drop his pick.  One by one, Janki leading, they crept into the old gallery--a six-foot way  with a scant four feet from hill to roof.    \"The air is better here,\" said Jasoda. They could hear her heart beating  in thick, sick bumps.    \"Slowly, slowly,\" said Janki. \"I am an old man, and I forget many things.  This is Tibu's gallery, but where are the four bricks where they used to  put their _huqa_ fire on when the Sahibs never saw? Slowly, slowly, O you  people behind.\"    They heard his hands disturbing the small coal on the floor of the gallery  and then a dull sound. \"This is one unbaked brick, and this is another and  another. Kundoo is a young man--let him come forward. Put a knee upon this  brick and strike here. When Tibu's gang were at dinner on the last day  before the good coal ended, they heard the men of Five on the other side,  and Five worked _their_ gallery two Sundays later--or it may have been  one. Strike there, Kundoo, but give me room to go back.\"    Kundoo, doubting, drove the pick, but the first soft crush of the coal was  a call to him. He was fighting for his life and for Unda--pretty little  Unda with rings on all her toes--for Unda and the forty rupees. The women  sang the Song of the Pick--the terrible, slow, swinging melody with the  muttered chorus that repeats the sliding of the loosened coal, and, to  each cadence, Kundoo smote in the black dark. When he could do no more,  Sunua Manji took the pick, and struck for his life and his wife, and his  village beyond the blue hills over the Tarachunda River. An hour the men  worked, and then the women cleared away the coal.    \"It is farther than I thought,\" said Janki. \"The air is very bad; but  strike, Kundoo, strike hard,\"    For the fifth time Kundoo took up the pick as the Sonthal crawled back.  The song had scarcely recommenced when it was broken by a yell from Kundoo  that echoed down the gallery: \"_Par hua! Par hua!_ We are through, we are  through!\" The imprisoned air in the mine shot through the opening, and the  women at the far end of the gallery heard the water rush through the  pillars of \"Bullia's Room\" and roar against the ledge. Having fulfilled  the law under which it worked, it rose no farther. The women screamed and  pressed forward, \"The water has come--we shall be killed! Let us go.\"    Kundoo crawled through the gap and found himself in a propped gallery by  the simple process of hitting his head against a beam.    \"Do I know the pits or do I not?\" chuckled Janki. \"This is the Number  Five; go you out slowly, giving me your names. Ho! Rahim, count your gang!  Now let us go forward, each catching hold of the other as before.\"    They formed a line in the darkness and Janki led them--for a pit-man in a  strange pit is only one degree less liable to err than an ordinary mortal  underground for the first time. At last they saw a flare-lamp, and Gangs  Janki, Mogul, and Rahim of Twenty-Two stumbled dazed into the glare of the  draught-furnace at the bottom of Five; Janki feeling his way and the rest  behind.    \"Water has come into Twenty-Two. God knows where are the others. I have  brought these men from Tibu's gallery in our cutting; making connection  through the north side of the gallery. Take us to the cage,\" said Janki  Meah.             *         *         *         *         *    At the pit-bank of Twenty-Two, some thousand people clamored and wept and  shouted. One hundred men--one thousand men--had been drowned in the  cutting. They would all go to their homes to-morrow. Where were their men?  Little Unda, her"]]]
