Now there  were no chimneys in Japan and he did not know what this was. The soot  nearly blinded and choked him. So he slid down and rushed out, only to  have his head nearly cracked by the farmer's wife, who gave him a whack  of her broomstick. She thought it was a crazy goat that she was  fighting. She first drove the Oni into the cellar and then bolted the  door.    An hour later, the farmer got a gun and loaded it. Then, with his hired  man he came near, one to pull open the door, and the other to shoot.  What they expected to find was a monster.    But no! So much experience, even within an hour, of things unknown in  Japan, including chimneys, had been too severe for the poor, lonely,  homesick Oni. There it lay dead on the floor, with its three fingers  held tightly to its snout and closing it. So much cheese, zuur kool  (sour krout), gin (schnapps), advocaat (brandy and eggs), cows' milk,  both sour and fresh, wooden shoes, lace collars and crimped neckwear,  with the various smells, had turned both the Oni's head and his stomach.  The very sight of these strange things being so unusual, gave the Oni  first fright, and then a nervous attack, while the odors, such as had  never tortured his nose before, had finished him.    The wise men of the village were called together to hold an inquest.  After summoning witnesses, and cross-examining them and studying the  strange creature, their verdict was that it could be nothing less than a  _Hersen Schim_, that is, a spectre of the brain. They meant by this  that there was no such animal.    However, a man from Delft, who followed the business of a knickerbocker,  or baker of knickers, or clay marles, begged the body of the Oni. He  wanted it to serve as a model for a new gargoyle, or rain spout, for the  roof of churches. Carved in stone, or baked in clay, which turns red and  is called terra cotta, the new style of monster became very popular. The  knickerbocker named it after a new devil, that had been expelled by the  prayers of the saints, and speedily made a fortune, by selling it to  stone cutters and architects. So for one real Oni, that died and was  buried in Dutch soil, there are thousands of imaginary ones, made of  baked clay, or stone, in the Dutch land, where things, more funny than  in fairy-land, constantly take place.    The dead Japanese Oni serving as a model, which was made into a water  gutter, served more useful purposes, for a thousand years, than ever he  had done, in the land where his relations still live and play their  pranks.          THE LEGEND OF THE WOODEN SHOE      In years long gone, too many for the almanac to tell of, or for clocks  and watches to measure, millions of good fairies came down from the sun  and went into the earth. There, they changed themselves into roots and  leaves, and became trees. There were many kinds of these, as they  covered the earth, but the pine and birch, ash and oak, were the chief  ones that made Holland. The fairies that lived in the trees bore the  name of Moss Maidens, or Tree \"Trintjes,\" which is the Dutch pet name  for Kate, or Katharine.    The oak was the favorite tree, for people lived then on acorns, which  they ate roasted, boiled or mashed, or made into meal, from which  something like bread was kneaded and baked. With oak bark, men tanned  hides and made leather, and, from its timber, boats and houses. Under  its branches, near the trunk, people laid their sick, hoping for help  from the gods. Beneath the oak boughs, also, warriors took oaths to be  faithful to their lords, women made promises, or wives joined hand in  hand around its girth, hoping to have beautiful children. Up among its  leafy branches the new babies lay, before they were found in the cradle  by the other children. To make a young child grow up to be strong and  healthy, mothers drew them through a split sapling or young tree. Even  more wonderful, as medicine for the country itself, the oak had power to  heal. The new land sometimes suffered from disease called the _val_  (or fall). When sick with the _val_, the ground sunk. Then people,  houses, churches, barns and cattle all went down, out of sight, and were  lost forever, in a flood of water.    But the oak, with its mighty roots, held the soil firm. Stories of dead  cities, that had tumbled beneath the waves, and of the famous Forest of  Reeds, covering a hundred villages, which disappeared in one night, were  known only too well.    Under the birch tree, lovers met to plight their vows, and on its smooth  bark was often cut the figure of two hearts joined in one. In summer,  the forest furnished shade, and in winter warmth from the fire. In the  spring time, the new leaves were a wonder, and in autumn the pigs grew  fat on the mast, or the acorns, that had dropped on the ground.    So, for thousands of years, when men made their home in the forest, and  wanted nothing else, the trees were sacred.    But by and by, when cows came into the land and sheep and horses  multiplied, more open ground was needed for pasture, grain fields and  meadows. Fruit trees, bearing apples and pears, peaches and cherries,  were planted, and grass, wheat, rye and barley were grown. Then, instead  of the dark woods, men liked to have their gardens and orchards open to  the sunlight. Still, the people were very rude, and all they had on  their bare feet were rough bits of hard leather, tied on through their  toes; though most of them went barefooted.    The forests had to be cut down. Men were so busy with the axe, that in a  few years, the Wood Land was gone. Then the new \"Holland,\" with its  people and red roofed houses, with its chimneys and windmills, and dykes  and storks, took the place of the old Holt Land of many trees.    Now there was a good man, a carpenter and very skilful with his tools,  who so loved the oak that he gave himself, and his children after him,  the name of Eyck, which is pronounced Ike, and is Dutch for oak. When,  before his neighbors and friends, according to the beautiful Dutch  custom, he called his youngest born child, to lay the corner-stone of  his new house, he bestowed upon her, before them all, the name of  Neeltje (or Nellie) Van Eyck.    The carpenter daddy continued to mourn over the loss of the forests. He  even shed tears, fearing lest, by and by, there should not one oak tree  be left in the country. Moreover, he was frightened at the thought that  the new land, made by pushing back the ocean and building dykes, might  sink down again and go back to the fishes. In such a case, all the  people, the babies and their mothers, men, women, horses and cattle,  would be drowned. The Dutch folks were a little too fast, he thought, in  winning their acres from the sea.    One day, while sitting on his door-step, brooding sorrowfully, a Moss  Maiden and a Tree Elf appeared, skipping along, hand in hand. They came  up to him and told him that his ancestral oak had a message for him.  Then they laughed and ran away. Van Eyck, which was now the man's full  family name, went into the forest and stood under the grand old oak  tree, which his fathers loved, and which he would allow none to cut  down.    Looking up, the leaves of the tree rustled, and one big branch seemed to  sweep near him. Then it whispered in his ear:    \"Do not mourn, for your descendants, even many generations hence, shall  see greater things than you have witnessed. I and my fellow oak trees  shall pass away, but the sunshine shall be spread over the land and make  it dry. Then, instead of its falling down, like acorns from the trees,  more and better food shall come up from out of the earth. Where green  fields now spread, and the cities grow where forests were, we shall come  to life again, but in another form. When most needed, we shall furnish  you and your children and children's children, with warmth, comfort,  fire, light, and wealth. Nor need you fear for the land, that it will  fall; for, even while living, we, and all the oak trees that are left,  and all the birch, beech, and pine trees shall stand on our heads for  you. We shall hold up your houses, lest they fall into the ooze and you  shall walk and run over our heads. As truly as when rooted in the soil,  will we do this. Believe what we tell you, and be happy. We shall turn  ourselves upside down for you.\"    \"I cannot see how all these things can be,\" said Van Eyck.    \"Fear not, my promise will endure.\"    The leaves of the branch rustled for another moment. Then, all was  still, until the Moss Maiden and Trintje, the Tree Elf, again, hand in  hand, as they tripped along merrily, appeared to him.    \"We shall help you and get our friends, the elves, to do the same. Now,  do you take some oak wood and saw off two pieces, each a foot long. See  that they are well dried. Then set them on the kitchen table to-night,  when you go to bed.\" After saying this, and looking at each other and  laughing, just as girls do, they disappeared.    Pondering on what all this might mean, Van Eyck went to his wood-shed  and sawed off the oak timber. At night, after his wife had cleared off  the supper table, he laid the foot-long pieces in their place.    When Van Eyck woke up in the morning, he recalled his dream, and, before  he was dressed, hurried to the kitchen. There, on the table, lay a pair  of neatly made wooden shoes. Not a sign of tools, or shavings could be  seen, but the clean wood and pleasant odor made him glad. When he  glanced again at the wooden shoes, he found them perfectly smooth, both  inside and out. They had heels at the bottom and were nicely pointed at  the toes, and, altogether, were very inviting to the foot. He tried them  on, and found that they fitted him exactly. He tried to walk on the  kitchen floor, which his wife kept scrubbed and polished, and then  sprinkled with clean white sand, with broomstick ripples scored in the  layers, but for Van Eyck it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7882"],[0,"The Life of Kit Carson: Hunter, Trapper, Guide, Indian Agent and Colonel U.S.A. (#15)"],[1,"a little while,  it died out. Then it must have been the red men concluded it was useless  to strive further, and, learning that the main body of the trappers were  not far off, they departed.    The annoyance from these Indians was so great that it was decided  to leave the country. While the trappers were able to hold their own  against them, yet it was impossible to make much progress in taking  furs, when their attention was mainly taken up in fighting the warriors,  who varied their shooting by destroying the traps that were set for the  beavers.    The next scene of operations was the North Fork of the Missouri where  they had been engaged only a short time when they came upon an extensive  village of Flathead Indians. These showed their friendliness to the  trappers by sending one of their chiefs and a number of warriors who  helped them hunt along the different streams.    The following spring Carson and a single companion set their traps  in the vicinity of Big Snake River. This was the country of the Utah  Indians, who were well disposed towards the whites. Thus, while furs  were plenty, the couple were enabled to devote their whole time to  taking them, without fear of being fired upon every time they ventured  out of sight of camp. As a consequence, they succeeded beyond their own  expectations, and, making their way to the nearest post, sold the stock  for a fair sum.    The peltries were scarcely disposed of, when Carson organized another  expedition which visited the Grand River, over which they trapped until  winter, when they returned to Brown's Hole, where Carson remained until  spring. Then he trapped once more in the land of the Utahs and at New  Park, taking their furs to the post where he was obliged to sell them  for a much less sum than he had ever received before.    The transaction had an important bearing on the fortunes of Kit Carson,  for it was proof of an unpleasant truth that had been forcing itself  for a number of months upon him: the days of remunerative trapping were  ended.    For years, the demand had been growing steadily less both in Europe and  America. The ingenuity of the manufacturer showed itself in the make  of cheaper substitutes, while the beavers that had been hunted so  persistently were becoming scarce: there were few regions in which  trapping could be pursued with any success.    Nothing could be plainer, therefore, to Carson than the fact that he  must soon give up the business and engage in something else to gain a  livelihood. What should it be?    Carson and several veteran trappers started for Bent's Fort, located on  the Arkansas, near an immense forest of cottonwoods, known as the Big  Timbers. Messrs. Bent and St. Vrain, the proprietors, no sooner learned  that Carson contemplated a change of occupation, than they offered  him the position of hunter for the fort, his duties being to keep it  supplied with all the game that was required.    Carson was more willing to accept the offer than he would have been  under other circumstances. He agreed that the large number of men should  never want for animal food, and, having given his promise, he kept it  most faithfully for a period of eight years.    This statement includes a great deal, for it means that his wonderful  rifle brought down thousands of deer, antelope, elk and bisons; that he  tramped over hundreds of leagues of wilderness; that his splendid  health never failed him, and that his knowledge of the woods and its  inhabitants was as full and complete as it could be.    Furthermore, it is stated by Dr. Peters, that during that entire period,  not a single impatient word passed between Carson and his employers. He  attended to his duties with such regularity, promptness and skill that  the only comments they could make on his work were in the nature of  strong compliments.    Inasmuch as we have claimed that Carson was the superior in every  respect of those with whom he was associated, we must dwell for a moment  on this fact. Let the reader ask himself how many cases he knows where  the term of service has been so long, in which not a single unkind word  has passed between employer and employee.    His occupation as hunter was not monotonous, for where there were so  many to provide for, difficult and dangerous work was required and the  journeys which he often made through the long stretches of wilderness  were sometimes attended with much personal danger.    But the surrounding tribes, including the Arapahoes, Kiowas, Cheyennes,  Comanches and others, looked upon the great hunter with affectionate  admiration and no guest was more welcome and honored in their lodges  than he.        CHAPTER XVIII.       Carson Visits his Old Home in Missouri--He Goes to St. Louis--Voyage up   the Missouri--Makes the Acquaintance of Lieutenant John C. Fremont--Is   engaged as a Guide for Fremont's First Expedition--The Start   Westward--Various Mishaps--The Emigrants--The False Alarm.    Kit Carson had left his home in Missouri when only a boy and he was now  in the prime of a vigorous young manhood. The years since he turned his  back upon his old home had been busy and eventful ones and now, as  is often the case with those placed as was he, he longed to visit the  scenes of his childhood, and to meet and shake the hands of those of his  old friends who were still among the living.    In the spring of 1842, Carson went eastward with a train of wagons,  carrying goods to the States. When the borders of Missouri were reached,  he bade his companions goodbye and made his way back to his old home.  His experience was touching. His parents were dead, the old building  which would ever linger in his memory, had tumbled down and nearly every  one whom he met was a stranger. The cheeks of the hardy mountaineer were  wet with tears, and with a sigh, he turned his face away forever.    Carson had never seen a large city, and he made his way to St. Louis,  where he spent more than a week in sight seeing. Before the end of that  time, the old yearning for the mountains, prairies and streams of  the West came back to him, and he engaged passage on a steamer up the  Missouri.    On the same boat John C. Fremont was a passenger. He was two years  younger than Carson and had been commissioned Second Lieutenant in the  Corps of Topographical Engineers, in 1838. Four years later he projected  a geographical survey of the entire territory of the United States from  the Missouri River to the Pacific.    Carson was attracted by the fine, manly and intellectual appearance of  Fremont, and, learning he was in search of a skilful mountaineer, he  introduced himself, referring in a modest fashion to his experience in  the west and expressing the belief that he could be of service to the  explorer.    Fremont was an excellent judge of character and was favorably impressed  with Carson from the first. The answers to the inquiries which he made  concerning the famous guide and mountaineer, were satisfactory in the  highest degree. He engaged Carson as his guide, agreeing to pay him a  salary of one hundred dollars a month.    The party of explorers were mainly gathered in St. Louis. It was  composed mostly of Creole and Canadian voyageurs, Charles Preuss, a  learned German, a young son of Colonel Benton (which statesman was the  father in law of Fremont), several other friends, including a noted  mountaineer named Maxwell, who was employed as the hunter of the party.  Including the commander, the entire company numbered twenty-eight.    With this party of explorers Fremont ascended the Missouri until the  mouth of the Kansas was reached, when they disembarked and made their  preparations for the long and dangerous journey before them. The march  westward began June 10, 1842.    The course lay along the banks of the Kansas. All the party were well  armed and well mounted, excepting eight men, each of whom drove a  cart, drawn by two mules. These carts contained the stores, baggage  and instruments of the expedition. A number of spare horses were taken  along, so as to provide against loss in that respect. In addition, they  had four oxen intended to serve as a reserve in the event of provisions  running short.    It was the custom to arouse the camp at daybreak and turn out the  animals to graze; breakfast followed and the march was begun. The noon  halt lasted from one to two hours and the afternoon's march ended a  short time before sunset. The tents were then pitched, horses hobbled  and turned out to graze, and the evening meal prepared. When it became  dark, all the animals were brought in and picketed, the carts arranged  so as to serve as barricades and guard mounted.    An Indian guide conducted the expedition for the first forty miles along  the Kansas, when he departed and the responsibility was turned over to  Carson. The pilot had guided the steamer out of the harbor and upon the  great ocean, and henceforth the hand of Carson was to be at the helm.    The soil over which they journeyed for many miles was of the most  fertile character. Numbers of Indian farms were seen, and one could  not but reflect on the possibilities of the future for the red man,  who should abandon war and give his energies to the cultivation of the  ground.    Such an expedition could not go far without a taste of the trials that  awaited them. On the second night, the four spare horses seemed to  become disgusted with the whole enterprise, and turning their heads  eastward started on a rapid gallop for the States. Their loss was too  serious to be borne, and a number of men were dispatched in pursuit.  The chase was a long one and the animals were not recovered for several  hours. One of the men lost his way and was forced to spend the night on  the open prairie. At midnight it began to rain, and then the exceedingly  unpleasant discovery was made that the tents on which the explorers  relied for protection and shelter were so thin that"]]]
