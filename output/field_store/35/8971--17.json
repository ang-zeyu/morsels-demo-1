A revolt headed by Amen-hetep, or  Amenophis IV. (about B.C. 1500), took place against the supremacy of  Amen in the middle of the XVIIIth dynasty, but it was unsuccessful. This  king hated the god and his name so strongly that he changed his own name  into that of \"Khu-en-Aten,\" _i.e._, \"the glory of the solar Disk,\" and  ordered the name of Amen to be obliterated, wherever possible, on  temples and other great monuments; and this was actually done in many  places. It is impossible to say exactly what the religious views of the  king were, but it is certain that he wished to substitute the cult of  Aten, a form of the Sun-god worshipped at Annu (_i.e._, On or  Heliopolis) in very ancient times, for that of Amen. \"Aten\" means  literally the \"Disk of the Sun,\" and though it is difficult to  understand at this distance of time in what the difference between the  worship of R[=a] and the worship of \"R[=a] in his Disk\" consisted, we  may be certain that there must have been some subtle, theological  distinction between them. But whatever the difference may have been, it  was sufficient to make Amenophis forsake the old capital Thebes and  withdraw to a place [Footnote: The site is marked by the ruins of Tell  el-Amarna.]some distance to the north of that city, where he carried on  the worship of his beloved god Aten. In the pictures of the Aten worship  which have come down to us the god appears in the form of a disk from  which proceed a number of arms and hands that bestow life upon his  worshippers. After the death of Amenophis the cult of Aten declined, and  Amen resumed his sway over the minds of the Egyptians.    Want of space forbids the insertion here of a full list of the titles of  Amen, and a brief extract from the Papyrus of the Princess Nesi-Khensu  [Footnote: For a hieroglyphic transcript of the hieratic text, see  Maspero, _Memoires_, tom. i., p. 594 ff.] must suffice to describe the  estimation in which the god was held about B.C. 1000. In this Amen is  addressed as \"the holy god, the lord of all the gods, Amen-R[=a], the  lord of the thrones of the world, the prince of Apt (_i.e._, Karnak),  the holy soul who came into being in the beginning, the great god who  liveth by right and truth, the first ennead who gave birth unto the  other two enneads, [Footnote: _i.e._, the great, the little, and the  least companies of the gods; each company (_paut_) contained nine gods.]  the being in whom every god existeth, the One of One, the creator of the  things which came into being when the earth took form in the beginning,  whose births are hidden, whose forms are manifold, and whose growth  cannot be known. The holy Form, beloved and terrible and mighty.... the  lord of space, the mighty One of the form of Khepera, who came into  existence through Khepera, the lord of the form of Khepera; when he came  into being nothing existed except himself. He shone upon the earth from  primeval time, he the Disk, the prince of light and radiance.... When  this holy god moulded himself, the heavens and the earth were made by  his heart (_or_ mind).... He is the Disk of the Moon, the beauties  whereof pervade the heavens and the earth, the untiring and beneficent  king whose will germinateth from rising to setting, from whose divine  eyes men and women come forth, and from whose mouth the gods do come,  and [by whom] food and meat and drink are made and provided, and [by  whom] the things which exist are created. He is the lord of time, and he  traverseth eternity; he is the aged one who reneweth his youth.... He is  the Being who cannot be known, and he is more hidden than all the  gods.... He giveth long life and multiplieth the years of those who are  favoured by him, he is the gracious protector of him whom he setteth in  his heart, and he is the fashioner of eternity and everlastingness. He  is the king of the North and of the South, Amen-R[=a], king of the gods,  the lord of heaven, and of earth, and of the waters and of the  mountains, with whose coming into being the earth began its existence,  the mighty one, more princely than, all the gods of the first company.\"    In the above extract, it will be noticed that Amen is called the \"One of  One,\" or the \"One One,\" a title which has been explained as having no  reference whatever to the unity of God as understood in modern times:  but unless these words are intended to express the idea of unity, what  is their meaning? It is also said that he is \"without second,\" and thus  there is no doubt whatever that when the Egyptians declared their god to  be One, and without a second, they meant precisely what the Hebrews and  Arabs meant when they declared their God to be One. [Footnote: See  Deut., vi. 4; and _Koran_, chapter cxii.] Such a God was an entirely  different Being from the personifications of the powers of nature and  the existences which, for want of a better name, have been called  \"gods.\"    But, besides R[=a], there existed in very early times a god called  HORUS, whose symbol was the hawk, which, it seems, was the first living  thing worshipped by the Egyptians; Horus was the Sun-god, like R[=a],  and in later times was confounded with Horus the son of Isis. The chief  forms of Horus given in the texts are: (1) HERU-UR (Aroueris), (2)  HERU-MERTI, (3) HERU-NUB, (4) HERU-KHENT-KHAT, (5) HERU-KHENT-AN-MAA, (6)  HERU-KHUTI, (7) HERU-SAM-TAUI, (8) HERU-HEKENNU, (9) HERU-BEHUTET.  Connected with one of the forms of Horus, originally, were the four gods  of the cardinal points, or the \"four, spirits of Horus,\" who supported  heaven at its four corners; their names were HAPI, TUAMUTEE, AMSET, and  QEBHSENNUF, and they represented the north, east, south, and west  respectively. The intestines of the dead were embalmed and placed in  four jars, each being under the protection, of one of these four gods.  Other important gods of the dead are: (1) ANUBIS, the son of R[=a] or  Osiris, who presided over the abode of the dead, and with AP-UAT shared  the dominion of the \"funeral mountain\"; the symbol of each of these gods  is a jackal. (2) HU and SA, the children of Temu, or R[=a], who appear  in the boat of the sun at the creation, and later in the Judgment Scene.  (3) The goddess MA[=A]T, who was associated with Thoth, Ptah, and Khnemu  in the work of creation; the name means \"straight,\" hence what is right,  true, truth, real, genuine, upright, righteous, just, steadfast,  unalterable, and the like. (4) The goddess HET-HERT (Hathor), _i.e._,  the \"house of Horus,\" which was that part of the sky where the sun rose  and set. The sycamore tree was sacred to her, and the deceased prays to  be fed by her with celestial food from out of it (5) The goddess  MEH-URT, who represented that portion of the sky in which the sun takes  his daily course; here it was, according to the view held at one period  at least, that the judgment of the deceased was supposed to take place.  (6) NEITH, the mother of SEBEK, who was also a goddess of the eastern  portion of the sky. (7) SEKHET and BAST, who are represented with the  heads of a lion and a cat, and who were symbols of the destroying,  scorching power of the sun, and of the gentle heat thereof,  respectively. (8) SERQ, who was a form of Isis. (9) TA-URT (Thoueris),  who was the genetrix of the gods. (10) UATCHET, who was a form of  Hather, and who had dominion over the northern sky, just as NEKHEBET was  mistress of the southern sky. (11) NEHEB-KA, who was a goddess who  possessed magical powers, and in some respects resembled Isis in her  attributes. (12) SEBAK, who was a form of the Sun-god, and was in later  times confounded with Sebak, or Sebek, the friend of Set. (13) AMSU (or  MIN or KUEM), who was the personification of the generative and  reproductive powers of nature. (14) BEB or BABA, who was the \"firstborn  son of Osiris.\" (15) H[=a]pi, who was the god of the Nile, and with whom  most of the great gods were identified.    The names of the beings who at one time or another were called \"gods\" in  Egypt are so numerous that a mere list of them would fill scores of  pages, and in a work of this kind would be out of place. The reader is,  therefore, referred to Lanzone's _Mitologia Egizia_, where a  considerable number are enumerated and described.          CHAPTER IV.      THE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD.    The belief that the deeds done in the body would be subjected to an  analysis and scrutiny by the divine powers after the death of a man  belongs to the earliest period of Egyptian civilization, and this belief  remained substantially the same in all generations. Though we have no  information as to the locality where the Last Judgment took place, or  whether the Egyptian soul passed into the judgment-hall immediately  after the death of the body, or after the mummification was ended and  the body was deposited in the tomb, it is quite certain that the belief  in the judgment was as deeply rooted in the Egyptians as the belief in  immortality. There seems to have been no idea of a general judgment when  all those who had lived in the world should receive their reward for the  deeds done in the body; on the contrary, all the evidence available goes  to show that each soul was dealt with individually, and was either  permitted to pass into the kingdom of Osiris and of the blessed, or was  destroyed straightway. Certain passages in the texts seem to suggest the  idea of the existence of a place for departed spirits wherein the souls  condemned in the judgment might dwell, but it must be remembered that it  was the enemies of R[=a], the Sun-god, that inhabited this region; and  it is impossible to imagine that the divine powers who presided over the  judgment would permit the souls of the wicked to live after they had  been condemned and to become enemies of those who were pure and blessed.

Sometimes she  thought he had really formed a plan for imposing upon her a condition  that she could not bear so much as to think of. But presently she  rejected this idea as an unworthy imputation upon her kinsman, and  concluded that it was only his way, and that all he meant was to try  her. To be resolved however, she determined to consult her constant  adviser, Mrs. Jakeman, and accordingly repeated to her what had passed.  Mrs. Jakeman saw the whole in a very different light from that in which  Emily had conceived it, and trembled for the future peace of her beloved  ward.    \"Lord bless me, my dear mamma!\" cried Emily, (this was the appellation  she delighted to bestow upon the good housekeeper,) \"you cannot think  so? But I do not care. I will never marry Grimes, happen what will.\"    \"But how will you help yourself? My master will oblige you.\"    \"Nay, now you think you are talking to a child indeed. It is I am to  have the man, not Mr. Tyrrel. Do you think I will let any body else  choose a husband for me? I am not such a fool as that neither.\"    \"Ah, Emily! you little know the disadvantages of your situation. Your  cousin is a violent man, and perhaps will turn you out of doors, if you  oppose him.\"    \"Oh, mamma! it is very wicked of you to say so. I am sure Mr. Tyrrel is  a very good man, though he be a little cross now and then. He knows very  well that I am right to have a will of my own in such a thing as this,  and nobody is punished for doing what is right.\"    \"Nobody ought, my dear child. But there are very wicked and tyrannical  men in the world.\"    \"Well, well, I will never believe my cousin is one of these.\"    \"I hope he is not.\"    \"And if he were, what then? To be sure I should he very sorry to make  him angry.\"    \"What then! Why then my poor Emily would be a beggar. Do you think I  could bear to see that?\"    \"No, no. Mr. Tyrrel has just told me that I have a hundred pounds. But  if I had no fortune, is not that the case with a thousand other folks?  Why should I grieve, for what they bear and are merry? Do not make  yourself uneasy, mamma. I am determined that I will do any thing rather  than marry Grimes; that is what I will.\"    Mrs. Jakeman could not bear the uneasy state of suspense in which this  conversation left her mind, and went immediately to the squire to have  her doubts resolved. The manner in which she proposed the question,  sufficiently indicated the judgment she had formed of the match.    \"That is true,\" said Mr. Tyrrel, \"I wanted to speak to you about this  affair. The girl has got unaccountable notions in her head, that will be  the ruin of her. You perhaps can tell where she had them. But, be that  as it will, it is high time something should be done. The shortest way  is the best, and to keep things well while they are well. In short, I am  determined she shall marry this lad: you do not know any harm of him, do  you? You have a good deal of influence with her, and I desire, do you  see, that you will employ it to lead her to her good: you had best, I  can tell you. She is a pert vixen! By and by she would be a whore, and  at last no better than a common trull, and rot upon a dunghill, if I  were not at all these pains to save her from destruction. I would make  her an honest farmer's wife, and my pretty miss cannot bear the thoughts  of it!\"    In the afternoon Grimes came according to appointment, and was left  alone with the young lady.    \"Well, miss,\" said he, \"it seems the squire has a mind to make us man  and wife. For my part, I cannot say I should have thought of it. But,  being as how the squire has broke the ice, if so be as you like of the  match, why I am your man. Speak the word; a nod is as good as a wink to  a blind horse.\"    Emily was already sufficiently mortified at the unexpected proposal of  Mr. Tyrrel. She was confounded at the novelty of the situation, and  still more at the uncultivated rudeness of her lover, which even  exceeded her expectation. This confusion was interpreted by Grimes into  diffidence.    \"Come, come, never be cast down. Put a good face upon it. What though?  My first sweetheart was Bet Butterfield, but what of that? What must be  must be; grief will never fill the belly. She was a fine strapping  wench, that is the truth of it! five foot ten inches, and as stout as a  trooper. Oh, she would do a power of work! Up early and down late;  milked ten cows with her own hands; on with her cardinal, rode to market  between her panniers, fair weather and foul, hail, blow, or snow. It  would have done your heart good to have seen her frost-bitten cheeks, as  red as a beefen from her own orchard! Ah! she was a maid of mettle;  would romp with the harvestmen, slap one upon the back, wrestle with  another, and had a rogue's trick and a joke for all round. Poor girl!  she broke her neck down stairs at a christening. To be sure I shall  never meet with her fellow! But never you mind that; I do not doubt that  I shall find more in you upon further acquaintance. As coy and bashful  as you seem, I dare say you are rogue enough at bottom. When I have  touzled and rumpled you a little, we shall see. I am no chicken, miss,  whatever you may think. I know what is what, and can see as far into a  millstone as another. Ay, ay; you will come to. The fish will snap at  the bait, never doubt it. Yes, yes, we shall rub on main well together.\"    Emily by this time had in some degree mustered up her spirits, and  began, though with hesitation, to thank Mr. Grimes for his good opinion,  but to confess that she could never be brought to favour his addresses.  She therefore entreated him to desist from all further application. This  remonstrance on her part would have become more intelligible, had it not  been for his boisterous manners and extravagant cheerfulness, which  indisposed him to silence, and made him suppose that at half a word he  had sufficient intimation of another's meaning. Mr. Tyrrel, in the mean  time, was too impatient not to interrupt the scene before they could  have time to proceed far in explanation; and he was studious in the  sequel to prevent the young folks from being too intimately acquainted  with each other's inclinations. Grimes, of consequence, attributed the  reluctance of Miss Melville to maiden coyness, and the skittish shyness  of an unbroken filly. Indeed, had it been otherwise, it is not probable  that it would have made any effectual impression upon him; as he was  always accustomed to consider women as made for the recreation of the  men, and to exclaim against the weakness of people who taught them to  imagine they were to judge for themselves.    As the suit proceeded, and Miss Melville saw more of her new admirer,  her antipathy increased. But, though her character was unspoiled by  those false wants, which frequently make people of family miserable  while they have every thing that nature requires within their reach, yet  she had been little used to opposition, and was terrified at the growing  sternness of her kinsman. Sometimes she thought of flying from a house  which was now become her dungeon; but the habits of her youth, and her  ignorance of the world, made her shrink from this project, when she  contemplated it more nearly, Mrs. Jakeman, indeed, could not think with  patience of young Grimes as a husband for her darling Emily; but her  prudence determined her to resist with all her might the idea on the  part of the young lady of proceeding to extremities. She could not  believe that Mr. Tyrrel would persist in such an unaccountable  persecution, and she exhorted Miss Melville to forget for a moment the  unaffected independence of her character, and pathetically to deprecate  her cousin's obstinacy. She had great confidence in the ingenuous  eloquence of her ward. Mrs. Jakeman did not know what was passing in the  breast of the tyrant.    Miss Melville complied with the suggestion of her mamma. One morning  immediately after breakfast, she went to her harpsichord, and played one  after another several of those airs that were most the favourites of Mr.  Tyrrel. Mrs. Jakeman had retired; the servants were gone to their  respective employments. Mr. Tyrrel would have gone also; his mind was  untuned, and he did not take the pleasure he had been accustomed to take  in the musical performances of Emily. But her finger was now more  tasteful than common. Her mind was probably wrought up to a firmer and  bolder tone, by the recollection of the cause she was going to plead; at  the same time that it was exempt from those incapacitating tremors which  would have been felt by one that dared not look poverty in the face. Mr.  Tyrrel was unable to leave the apartment. Sometimes he traversed it with  impatient steps; then he hung over the poor innocent whose powers were  exerted to please him; at length he threw himself in a chair opposite,  with his eyes turned towards Emily. It was easy to trace the progress of  his emotions. The furrows into which his countenance was contracted were  gradually relaxed; his features were brightened into a smile; the  kindness with which he had upon former occasions contemplated Emily  seemed to revive in his heart.    Emily watched her opportunity. As soon as she had finished one of the  pieces, she rose and went to Mr. Tyrrel.    \"Now, have not I done it nicely? and after this will not you give me a  reward?\"    \"A reward! Ay, come here, and I will give you a kiss.\"    \"No, that is not it. And yet you have not kissed me this many a day.  Formerly you said you loved me, and called me your Emily. I am sure you  did not love me better than I loved you. You have not forgot all the  kindness you once had for me?\" added she anxiously.    \"Forgot? No, no. How can you ask such a question? You shall be my dear  Emily still!\"    \"Ah, those were"]]]
