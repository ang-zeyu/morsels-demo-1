It would just be  stupidity if you didn't. It's only vanity when you get puffed up about  them. I am not a bit pretty. My only good points are my hair and eyes  and feet. So I think it's real mean that one of them has to be covered  up the most of the time. I'm always glad when it gets warm enough to go  barefooted. But, when I grow up they'll have to covered all the time. It  IS mean.\"    \"You'll have to put your shoes and stockings on when you go to the magic  lantern show to-night,\" said Felicity in a tone of satisfaction.    \"I don't know that. I'm thinking of going barefooted.\"    \"Oh, you wouldn't! Sara Stanley, you're not in earnest!\" exclaimed  Felicity, her blue eyes filling with horror.    The Story Girl winked with the side of her face next to Felix and me,  but the side next the girls changed not a muscle. She dearly loved to  \"take a rise\" out of Felicity now and then.    \"Indeed, I would if I just made up my mind to. Why not? Why not bare  feet--if they're clean--as well as bare hands and face?\"    \"Oh, you wouldn't! It would be such a disgrace!\" said poor Felicity in  real distress.    \"We went to school barefooted all June,\" argued that wicked Story Girl.  \"What is the difference between going to the schoolhouse barefooted in  the daytime and going in the evening?\"    \"Oh, there's EVERY difference. I can't just explain it--but every one  KNOWS there is a difference. You know it yourself. Oh, PLEASE, don't do  such a thing, Sara.\"    \"Well, I won't, just to oblige you,\" said the Story Girl, who would  have died the death before she would have gone to a \"public meeting\"  barefooted.    We were all rather excited over the magic lantern show which an  itinerant lecturer was to give in the schoolhouse that evening. Even  Felix and I, who had seen such shows galore, were interested, and the  rest were quite wild. There had never been such a thing in Carlisle  before. We were all going, Peter included. Peter went everywhere with us  now. He was a regular attendant at church and Sunday School, where his  behaviour was as irreproachable as if he had been \"raised\" in the caste  of Vere de Vere. It was a feather in the Story Girl's cap, for she took  all the credit of having started Peter on the right road. Felicity was  resigned, although the fatal patch on Peter's best trousers was still  an eyesore to her. She declared she never got any good of the singing,  because Peter stood up then and every one could see the patch. Mrs.  James Clark, whose pew was behind ours, never took her eye off it--or so  Felicity averred.    But Peter's stockings were always darned. Aunt Olivia had seen to that,  ever since she heard of Peter's singular device regarding them on his  first Sunday. She had also given Peter a Bible, of which he was so proud  that he hated to use it lest he should soil it.    \"I think I'll wrap it up and keep it in my box,\" he said. \"I've an old  Bible of Aunt Jane's at home that I can use. I s'pose it's just the  same, even if it is old, isn't it?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" Cecily had assured him. \"The Bible is always the same.\"    \"I thought maybe they'd got some new improvements on it since Aunt  Jane's day,\" said Peter, relieved.    \"Sara Ray is coming along the lane, and she's crying,\" announced Dan,  who was peering out of a knot-hole on the opposite side of the loft.    \"Sara Ray is crying half her time,\" said Cecily impatiently. \"I'm sure  she cries a quartful of tears a month. There are times when you can't  help crying. But I hide then. Sara just goes and cries in public.\"    The lachrymose Sara presently joined us and we discovered the cause of  her tears to be the doleful fact that her mother had forbidden her to  go to the magic lantern show that night. We all showed the sympathy we  felt.    \"She SAID yesterday you could go,\" said the Story Girl indignantly. \"Why  has she changed her mind?\"    \"Because of the measles in Markdale,\" sobbed Sara. \"She says Markdale is  full of them, and there'll be sure to be some of the Markdale people at  the show. So I'm not to go. And I've never seen a magic lantern--I've  never seen ANYTHING.\"    \"I don't believe there's any danger of catching measles,\" said Felicity.  \"If there was we wouldn't be allowed to go.\"    \"I wish I COULD get the measles,\" said Sara defiantly. \"Maybe I'd be of  some importance to ma then.\"    \"Suppose Cecily goes down with you and coaxes your mother,\" suggested  the Story Girl. \"Perhaps she'd let you go then. She likes Cecily. She  doesn't like either Felicity or me, so it would only make matters worse  for us to try.\"    \"Ma's gone to town--pa and her went this afternoon--and they're not  coming back till to-morrow. There's nobody home but Judy Pineau and me.\"    \"Then,\" said the Story Girl, \"why don't you just go to the show anyhow?  Your mother won't ever know, if you coax Judy to hold her tongue.\"    \"Oh, but that's wrong,\" said Felicity. \"You shouldn't put Sara up to  disobeying her mother.\"    Now, Felicity for once was undoubtedly right. The Story Girl's  suggestion WAS wrong; and if it had been Cecily who protested, the Story  Girl would probably have listened to her, and proceeded no further  in the matter. But Felicity was one of those unfortunate people whose  protests against wrong-doing serve only to drive the wrong-doer further  on her sinful way.    The Story Girl resented Felicity's superior tone, and proceeded to tempt  Sara in right good earnest. The rest of us held our tongues. It was, we  told ourselves, Sara's own lookout.    \"I have a good mind to do it,\" said Sara, \"but I can't get my good  clothes; they're in the spare room, and ma locked the door, for fear  somebody would get at the fruit cake. I haven't a single thing to wear,  except my school gingham.\"    \"Well, that's new and pretty,\" said the Story Girl. \"We'll lend you  some things. You can have my lace collar. That'll make the gingham quite  elegant. And Cecily will lend you her second best hat.\"    \"But I've no shoes or stockings. They're locked up too.\"    \"You can have a pair of mine,\" said Felicity, who probably thought that  since Sara was certain to yield to temptation, she might as well be  garbed decently for her transgression.    Sara did yield. When the Story Girl's voice entreated it was not easy  to resist its temptation, even if you wanted to. That evening, when  we started for the schoolhouse, Sara Ray was among us, decked out in  borrowed plumes.    \"Suppose she DOES catch the measles?\" Felicity said aside.    \"I don't believe there'll be anybody there from Markdale. The lecturer  is going to Markdale next week. They'll wait for that,\" said the Story  Girl airily.    It was a cool, dewy evening, and we walked down the long, red hill in  the highest of spirits. Over a valley filled with beech and spruce was  a sunset afterglow--creamy yellow and a hue that was not so much red as  the dream of red, with a young moon swung low in it. The air was sweet  with the breath of mown hayfields where swaths of clover had been  steeping in the sun. Wild roses grew pinkly along the fences, and the  roadsides were star-dusted with buttercups.    Those of us who had nothing the matter with our consciences enjoyed our  walk to the little whitewashed schoolhouse in the valley. Felicity  and Cecily were void of offence towards all men. The Story Girl walked  uprightly like an incarnate flame in her crimson silk. Her pretty feet  were hidden in the tan-coloured, buttoned Paris boots which were the  secret envy of every school girl in Carlisle.    But Sara Ray was not happy. Her face was so melancholy that the Story  Girl lost patience with her. The Story Girl herself was not altogether  at ease. Probably her own conscience was troubling her. But admit it she  would not.    \"Now, Sara,\" she said, \"you just take my advice and go into this with  all your heart if you go at all. Never mind if it is bad. There's no  use being naughty if you spoil your fun by wishing all the time you were  good. You can repent afterwards, but there is no use in mixing the two  things together.\"    \"I'm not repenting,\" protested Sara. \"I'm only scared of ma finding it  out.\"    \"Oh!\" The Story Girl's voice expressed her scorn. For remorse she  had understanding and sympathy; but fear of her fellow creatures was  something unknown to her. \"Didn't Judy Pineau promise you solemnly she  wouldn't tell?\"    \"Yes; but maybe some one who sees me there will mention it to ma.\"    \"Well, if you're so scared you'd better not go. It isn't too late.  Here's your own gate,\" said Cecily.    But Sara could not give up the delights of the show. So she walked on,  a small, miserable testimony that the way of the transgressor is never  easy, even when said transgressor is only a damsel of eleven.    The magic lantern show was a splendid one. The views were good and the  lecturer witty. We repeated his jokes to each other all the way home.  Sara, who had not enjoyed the exhibition at all, seemed to feel more  cheerful when it was over and she was going home. The Story Girl on the  contrary was gloomy.    \"There WERE Markdale people there,\" she confided to me, \"and the  Williamsons live next door to the Cowans, who have measles. I wish I'd  never egged Sara on to going--but don't tell Felicity I said so. If Sara  Ray had really enjoyed the show I wouldn't mind. But she didn't. I could  see that. So I've done wrong and made her do wrong--and there's nothing  to show for it.\"    The night was scented and mysterious. The wind was playing an eerie  fleshless melody in the reeds of the brook hollow. The sky was dark and  starry, and across it the Milky Way flung its shimmering misty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53506"],[0,"A Collection of Kachári Folk-Tales and Rhymes (#15)"],[1,"tobacco; one piece for spinning  cotton; one piece for fretting cotton; one piece for weaving cloth;  one piece for cooking rice; one piece for drawing water;\" and so on,  with all her occupations. But, on counting up, he found that the old  woman's share was much the biggest. On which he cried angrily that  it was not to be believed that a woman's share could be bigger than  his, and, mixing up all the pieces of flesh on the ground, he began a  fresh division. This time he set apart the old woman's share first,  and his own afterwards. This time his share became the largest. But  still he was not satisfied, and, mixing all the gobbets up again,  he divided them again and again, but never got them equal. Meanwhile,  the day had slipped by and evening was come. So the old woman, taking  the pestle of the dhenki, went to look for her husband, and there she  found him in the midst of the lumps of flesh, which had become covered  with dust and dirt through much mixing. Then the old woman let fly the  dhenki stump at his back. On which he cried that a snake had bitten  him and ran home, on which the old woman tied up the meat in a cloth  and carried it to her house, and cooked some hastily for supper. And  when her husband asked where the meat came from, she said that he had  been such a long time in coming, that she had killed a chicken and  cooked it for him. \"And if you had stopped dividing that deer's flesh,  we should never have got any supper at all,\" said she. And that's all!            THE STORY OF THE FOUR THIEVES.    There was an aged couple who lived in a pair of houses. And four  thieves used to prowl round their houses, seeking to steal. And the old  man set to work to contrive devices to disappoint them. And first he  filled a joint of bamboo with cowdung and dirty water and rice-chaff,  and hung it up in the rafters of the dhenki-shed. And when at nightfall  the thieves began prowling round and listening to hear if the inmates  were asleep, the old people overheard them, and the old man said to his  wife \"Old woman, old woman; where have you hung up the molasses and  milk and chira?\" And the old woman replied \"A nice business! I have  been and gone and hung them up in the dhenki-shed, where the thieves  can get at them.\" And the thieves, hearing this, slipped off to the  shed, and, getting the bamboo-joint, gathered plantain leaves for  plates, and divided the spoil and sat down to eat. And one of them,  smelling at the stuff, said to the others \"Smells rather strong,  doesn't it?\" Then one of them took his mess in his hand and smelled  it, and, seeing what had happened, they all burst out laughing. Then  the old man came out with his big stick, and the four thieves ran  away. Another day, the old man, hearing the thieves prowling about,  said to his wife \"Where have you hung the packet of salt?\" And the  old woman replied \"A fine affair! I have hung it up on south wall of  our sleeping-house, where the thieves can easily get it.\" And so one  of the thieves thrust his hand in, and began feeling about for the  bundle, on which the old man took his knife and cut his hand. But he  only said \"I can't find it,\" and went away.    On which the other three felt about, and one got his finger cut,  and another his ear, and the fourth his nose. Then they looked  about in the yard for something to ease the pain, and the first,  finding a cooking pot in which acrid plantain ashes had been steeped,  plunged his hand in, and, getting more pain than before, only said  \"Ah! that's good.\" On which the others followed his example. And,  while they were hopping about in pain, the old man came out and took  his stick, and drove them away.    Another day, the old people found a wasps' nest on a chili plant  under a plantain tree. And when the thieves came, the old man said to  his wife \"Old woman, old woman, where have you put the lota with our  money in it?\" And the old woman answered \"To-day's luck is the worst  of all. I have left the lota under the plantain tree in the garden,  by the chili bush, and no doubt the thieves will get it.\" Hearing  this, the thieves went and disturbed the wasps' nest, and the wasps  flew out and stung them. And when they cried in pain and ran away,  the old man ran after them with his stick and beat them soundly.    Again, another day, when the old man went out to cut reeds for his  fence, he found the four thieves asleep under an O tree (the fruit of  which is hard and heavy), and the old man, climbing quietly into the  tree, cut four of the fruits, with the stalks attached, and tied them  to the thieves' hair. Then he suddenly cried out \"Thief! thief!\" And  the more they ran, the more the heavy fruit bumped on their backs,  so that they thought the old man was running after them and beating  them. And they ran a very long way before they discovered their  mistake, and unloosed the fruit from their hair.    And, again, the old man climbed into the mat receptacle in which  the paddy was stored; but, before doing so, he instructed his wife to  imitate his voice and ask where the brass plates and cups had been put;  and to answer in her own voice that they had been put into the paddy  receptacle in the dhenki-shed. And when the thieves heard all this,  they hurried to the dhenki-shed, and, lifting up the paddy receptacle,  said with one accord: \"My! isn't it heavy?\" And so they tied it to  poles and carried it away on their shoulders.    Presently, they came to a deep river, and as they were wading across,  the old man cried \"Look here! I am getting wet, carry it higher.\" On  which they said to one another \"Surely, some one spoke?\" But, thinking  it was a mistake, they went on, and came to deeper water. On this the  old man called out again \"Stupid brutes! Sons of slaves! Can't you see  your way? I am getting wet through.\" And the thieves were frightened,  and, dropping the old man in the water, ran clean away. That's all!                  FOLK SONGS AND NURSERY RHYMES.
