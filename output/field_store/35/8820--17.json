B. steamer.    Being the 4th of July, the usual torrential rains set in. During  the worst of it we put in at Salt River village. It was amusing  to see the rubbish about the doors of these temporarily deserted  cabins. The midden-heaps of the Cave-men are our principal sources  of information about those by-gone races; the future ethnologist who  discovers Salt River midden-heaps will find all the usual skulls,  bones, jaws, teeth, flints, etc., mixed with moccasin beads from  Venice, brass cartridges from New England, broken mirrors from  France, Eley cap-boxes from London, copper rings, silver pins,  lead bullets, and pewter spoons, and interpersed with them bits of  telephone wires and the fragments of gramophone  discs. I wonder  what they will make of the last!    Eight miles farther we camped in the rain, reaching the Buffalo  Portage next morning at 10, and had everything over its 5 miles by  7 o'clock at night.    It is easily set down on paper, but the uninitiated can scarcely  realise the fearful toil of portaging. If you are an office man,  suppose you take an angular box weighing 20 or 30 pounds; if a  farmer, double the weight, poise it on your shoulders or otherwise,  as you please, and carry it half a mile on a level pavement in  cool, bright weather, and I am mistaken if you do not find yourself  suffering horribly before the end of a quarter-mile; the last part  of the trip will have been made in something like mortal agony.  Remember, then, that each of these portagers was carrying 150 to  250 pounds of broken stuff, not half a mile, but several miles,  not on level pavement, but over broken rocks, up banks, through  quagmires and brush--in short, across ground that would be difficult  walking without any burden, and not in cool, clear weather, but through  stifling swamps with no free hand to ease the myriad punctures of  his body, face, and limbs whenever unsufficiently protected from  the stingers that roam in clouds. It is the hardest work I ever  saw performed by human beings; the burdens are heavier than some  men will allow their horses to carry.    Yet all this frightful labour was cheerfully gone through by white  men, half-breeds, and Indians alike. They accept it as a part of  their daily routine. This fact alone is enough to guarantee the  industrial future of the red-man when the hunter life is no longer  possible.    Next day we embarked on the Little Buffalo River, beginning what  should have been and would have been a trip of memorable joys but  for the awful, awful, awful--see Chapter IX.    The Little Buffalo is the most beautiful river in the whole world  except, perhaps, its affluent, the Nyarling.    This statement sounds like the exaggeration of mere impulsive  utterance. Perhaps it is; but I am writing now after thinking the  matter over for two and a half years, during, which time I have  seen a thousand others, including the upper Thames, the Afton, the  Seine, the Arno, the Tiber, the Iser, the Spree, and the Rhine.    A hundred miles long is this uncharted stream; fifty feet its breadth  of limpid tide; eight feet deep, crystal clear, calm, slow, and  deep to the margin. A steamer could ply on its placid, unobstructed  flood, a child could navigate it anywhere. The heavenly beauty of  the shores, with virgin forest of fresh, green spruces towering a  hundred feet on every side, or varied in open places with long rows  and thick-set hedges of the gorgeous, wild, red, Athabaska rose,  made a stream that most canoemen,  woodmen,  and naturalists would  think without a fault or flaw, and with every river beauty in its  highest possible degree. Not trees and flood alone had strenuous  power to win our souls; at every point and bank, in every bend,  were living creatures of the north, Beaver and Bear, not often seen  but abundant; Moose tracks showed from time to time and birds were  here in thousands. Rare winter birds, as we had long been taught  to think them in our southern homes; here we found them in their  native land and heard not a few sweet melodies, of which in faraway  Ontario, New Jersey, and Maryland we had been favoured only with  promising scraps when wintry clouds were broken by the sun. Nor were  the old familiar ones away--Flicker, Sapsucker, Hairy Woodpecker,  Kingfisher, Least Flycatcher, Alder Flycatcher, Robin, Crow, and  Horned Owl were here to mingle their noises with the stranger melodies  and calls of Lincoln Sparrow, Fox Sparrow, Olive-sided Flycatcher,  Snipe, Rusty Blackbird, and Bohemian Waxwing.    Never elsewhere have I seen Horned Owls so plentiful. I did not know  that there were so many Bear and Beaver left; I never was so much  impressed by the inspiring raucous clamour of the Cranes, the  continual spatter of Ducks, the cries of Gulls and Yellowlegs.  Hour after hour we paddled down that stately river adding our 3  1/2 miles to its 1 mile speed; each turn brought to view some new  and lovelier aspect of bird and forest life. I never knew a land  of balmier air; I never felt the piney breeze more sweet; nowhere  but in the higher mountains is there such a tonic sense abroad;  the bright woods and river reaches were eloquent of a clime whose  maladies are mostly foreign-born. But alas! I had to view it all  swaddled, body, hands, and head, like a bee-man handling his swarms.  Songs were muffled, scenes were dimmed by the thick, protecting,  suffocating veil without which men can scarcely live.    Ten billion dollars would be all too small reward, a trifle totally  inadequate to compensate, mere nominal recognition of the man who  shall invent and realise a scheme to save this earthly paradise  from this its damning pest and malediction.          CHAPTER XVIII    DOWN TO FUNDAMENTALS        At 8.30 A. M., 10 miles from the portage, we came to the Clew-ee,  or White Fish River; at 6.30 P. M. made the Sass Tessi, or Bear  River, and here camped, having covered fully 40 miles.    Now for the first time we were all together, with leisure to  question our guide and plan in detail. But all our mirth and hopes  were rudely checked by Corporal Selig, who had entire charge of  the commissary, announcing that there were only two days' rations  left.    In the dead calm that followed this bomb-shell we all did some  thinking; then a rapid fire of questions demonstrated the danger  of having a guide who does not speak our language.    It seems that when asked how many days' rations we should take on  this Buffalo hunt he got the idea how many days to the Buffalo. He  said five, meaning five days each way and as much time as we wished  there. We were still two days from our goal. Now what should we  do? Scurry back to the fort or go ahead and trust to luck? Every  man present voted \"go ahead on half rations.\"    We had good, healthy appetites; half rations was veritable hardship;  but our hollow insides made hearty laughing. Preble disappeared  as soon  as we camped, and now at the right time he returned and  silently threw at the cook's feet a big 6-pound Pike. It was just  right, exactly as it happens in the most satisfactory books and plays.  It seems that he always carried a spoon-hook, and went at once to  what he rightly judged the best place, a pool at the junction of  the two rivers. The first time he threw he captured the big fellow.  Later he captured three smaller ones in the same place, but evidently  there were no more.    That night we had a glorious feast; every one had as much as he  could eat, chiefly fish. Next morning we went on 4 1/2 miles farther,  then came to the mouth of the Nyarling Tessi, or Underground River,  that joins the Buffalo from the west. This was our stream; this  was the highway to the Buffalo country. It was a miniature of the  river we were leaving, but a little quicker in current. In about  2 miles we came to a rapid, but were able to paddle up. About 6  miles farther was an immense and ancient log-jamb that filled the  stream from bank to bank for 190 yards. What will be the ultimate  history of this jamb? It is added to each year, the floods have no  power to move it, logs in water practically never rot, there is no  prospect of it being removed by natural agencies. I suspect that  at its head the river comes out of a succession of such things,  whence its name Underground River.,    Around this jamb is an easy portage. We were far now from the haunts  of any but Indians on the winter hunt, so were surprised to see on  this portage trail the deep imprints of a white man's boot. These  were made apparently within a week, by whom I never learned. On the  bank not far away we saw a Lynx pursued overhead by two scolding  Redsquirrels.    Lunch consisted of what remained of the Pike, but that afternoon  Bezkya saw two Brown Cranes on a meadow, and manoeuvring till they  were in line killed both with one shot of his rifle at over 100  yards, the best shot I ever knew an Indian to make. Still, two  Cranes totalling 16 pounds gross is not enough meat to last five  men a week, so we turned to our Moosehunter.    \"Yes, he could get a Moose.\" He went on in the small canoe with  Billy; we were to follow, and if we passed his canoe leave a note.  Seven miles above the log-jamb, the river forked south and west;  here a note from the guide sent us up the South Fork; later we  passed his canoe on the bank and knew that he had landed and was  surely on his way \"to market.\" What a comfortable feeling it was to  remember that Bezkya was a moose-hunter! We left word and travelled  till 7, having come 11 miles up from the river's mouth. Our supper  that night was Crane, a little piece of bread each, some soup, and  some tea.    At 10 the hunters came back empty-handed. Yes, they found a fresh  Moose track, but the creature was so pestered by clouds of -------"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#15)"],[1,"Foljambe.    But Georgie, as he put some jam into his saucer, could not help  wondering whether the message of love had not done it.    He dined alone, for Hermy and Ursy did not appear, and had a great  polishing of his knick-knacks afterwards, while waiting for them. No  one ever felt anxious at the non-arrival of those sisters, for they  always turned up from their otter-hunting or their golf sooner or  later, chiefly later, in the highest spirits at the larks they had had,  with amazingly dirty hands and prodigious appetite. But when twelve  o'clock struck, he decided to give up all idea of their appearance that  night, and having given Tipsipoozie some more jam and a comfortable bed  in the woodshed, he went upstairs to his room. Though he knew it was  still possible that he might be roused by wild \"Cooees!\" and showers of  gravel at his window, and have to come down and minister to their gross  appetites, the prospect seemed improbable and he soon went to sleep.    Georgie awoke with a start some hours later, wondering what had  disturbed him. There was no gravel rattling on his window, no violent  ringing of bicycle bells, nor loud genial shouts outraging the decorous  calm of Riseholme, but certainly he had heard something. Next moment,  the repeated noise sent his heart leaping into his throat, for quite  distinctly he heard a muffled sound in the room below, which he  instantly diagnosed with fatal certainty as burglars. The first emotion  that mingled itself with the sheer terror, was a passionate regret that  Hermy and Ursy had not come. They would have thought it tremendous  larks, and would have invented some wonderful offensive with fire-irons  and golf-clubs and dumb-bells. Even Tipsipoozie, the lately-abhorred,  would have been a succour in this crisis, and why, oh why, had not  Georgie had him to sleep in his bedroom instead of making him cosy in  the woodshed? He would have let Tipsipoozie sleep on his lovely blue  quilt for the remainder of his days, if only Tipsipoozie could have  been with him now, ready to have fun with the burglar below. As it was,  the servants were in the attics at the top of the house, Dicky slept  out, and Georgie was all alone, with the prospect of having to defend  his property at risk of his life. Even at this moment, as he sat up in  bed, blanched with terror, these miscreants might be putting his  treasure into their pockets. The thought of the Faberge cigarette case,  and the Louis XVI snuff box, and the Queen Anne toy-porringer which he  had inherited all these years, made even life seem cheap, for life  would be intolerable without them, and he sprang out of bed, groped for  his slippers, since until he had made a plan it was wiser not to shew a  light, and shuffled noiselessly towards the door.          Chapter SIX      The door-handle felt icy to fingers already frozen with fright, but he  stood firmly grasping it, ready to turn it noiselessly when he had  quite made up his mind what to do. The first expedient that suggested  itself with an overpowering sweetness of relief, was that of locking  his door, going back to bed again, and pretending that he had heard  nothing. But apart from the sheer cowardice of that, which he did not  mind so much, as nobody else would ever know his guilt, the thought of  the burglar going off quite unmolested with his property was  intolerable. Even if he could not summon up enough courage to get  downstairs with his life and a poker in his hand, he must at least give  them a good fright. They had frightened him, and so he would frighten  them. They should not have it all their own way, and if he decided not  to attack them (or him) single-handed, he could at least thump on the  floor, and call out \"Burglars!\" at the top of his voice, or shout  \"Charles! Henry! Thomas!\" as if summoning a bevy of stalwart footmen.  The objection to this course, however, would be that Foljambe or  somebody else might hear him, and in this case, if he did not then go  downstairs to mortal combat, the knowledge of his cowardice would be  the property of others beside himself.... And all the time he  hesitated, they were probably filling their pockets with his dearest  possessions.    He tried to send out a message of love, but he was totally unable to do  so.    Then the little clock in his mantelpiece struck two, which was a  miserable hour, sundered so far from dawn.    Though he had lived through years of agony since he got out of bed, the  actual passage of time, as he stood frozen to the door-handle, was but  the duration of a few brief seconds, and then making a tremendous call  on his courage he felt his way to his fireplace, and picked up the  poker. The tongs and shovel rattled treacherously, and he hoped that  had not been heard, for the essence of his plan (though he had yet no  idea what that plan was) must be silence till some awful surprise broke  upon them. If only he could summon the police, he could come rushing  downstairs with his poker, as the professional supporters of the law  gained an entrance to his house, but unfortunately the telephone was  downstairs, and he could not reasonably hope to carry on a conversation  with the police station without being overheard by the burglars.    He opened his door with so masterly a movement that there was no sound  either from the hinges nor from the handle as he turned it, and peered  out. The hall below was dark, but a long pencil of light came from the  drawing room, which showed where the reckless brutes must be, and  there, too, alas! was his case of treasures. Then suddenly he heard the  sound of a voice, speaking very low, and another voice answered it. At  that Georgie's heart sank, for this proved that there must be at least  two burglars, and the odds against him were desperate. After that came  a low, cruel laugh, the unmistakable sound of the rattle of knives and  forks, and the explosive uncorking of a bottle. At that his heart sank  even lower yet, for he had read that cool habitual burglars always had  supper before they got to work, and therefore he was about to deal with  a gang of professionals. Also that explosive uncorking clearly  indicated champagne, and he knew that they were feasting on his best.  And how wicked of them to take their unhallowed meal in his  drawing-room, for there was no proper table there, and they  would be making a dreadful mess over everything.    A current of cool night air swept up the stairs, and Georgie saw the  panel of light from the open drawing-room door diminish in width, and  presently the door shut with a soft thud, leaving him in the dark. At  that his desperation seemed pressed and concentrated into a moment of  fictitious courage, for he unerringly reasoned that they had left the  drawing-room window open, and that perhaps in a few moments now they  would have finished their meal and with bulging pockets would step  forth unchallenged into the night. Why had he never had bolts put on  his shutters, like Mrs Weston, who lived in nightly terror of burglars?  But it was too late to think of that now, for it was impossible to ask  them to step out till he had put bolts up, and then when he was ready  begin again.    He could not let them go gorged with his champagne and laden with his  treasures without reprisals of some sort, and keeping his thoughts  steadily away from revolvers and clubs and sandbags, walked straight  downstairs, threw open the drawing-room door, and with his poker  grasped in his shaking hand, cried out in a faint, thin voice:    \"If you move I shall fire.\"    There was a moment of dead silence, and a little dazzled with the light  he saw what faced him.    At opposite ends of his Chippendale sofa sat Hermy and Ursy. Hermy had  her mouth open and held a bun in her dirty hands. Ursy had her mouth  shut and her cheeks were bulging. Between them was a ham and a loaf of  bread, and a pot of marmalade and a Stilton cheese, and on the floor  was the bottle of champagne with two brimming bubbling tea cups full of  wine. The cork and the wire and the tin-foil they had, with some show  of decency, thrown into the fireplace.    Hermy put down her bun, and gave a great shout of laughter; Ursy's  mouth was disgustingly full and she exploded. Then they lay back  against the arms of the sofa and howled.    Georgie was very much vexed.    \"Upon my word, Hermy!\" he said, and then found it was not nearly a  strong enough expression. And in a moment of ungovernable irritation he  said:    \"Damn it all!\"    Hermy showed signs of recovery first, and as Georgie came back after  shutting the window, could find her voice, while Ursy collected small  fragments of ham and bread which she had partially chewed.    \"Lord! What a lark!\" she said. \"Georgie, it's _the_ most ripping  lark.\"    Ursy pointed to the poker.    \"He'll fire if we move,\" she cried. \"Or poke the fire, was it?\"    \"Ask another!\" screamed Hermy. \"Oh, dear, he thought we were burglars,  and came down with a poker, brave boy! It's positively the limit. Have  a drink, Georgie.\"    Suddenly her eyes grew round and awestruck, and pointing with her  finger to Georgie's shoulder, she went off into another yell of  laughter.    \"Ursy! His hair!\" she said, and buried her face in a soft cushion.    Naturally Georgie had not put his hair in order when he came  downstairs, for nobody thinks about things like that when he is going  to encounter burglars single-handed, and there was his bald pate and  his long tresses hanging down one side.    It was most annoying, but when an irremediable annoyance has absolutely  occurred, the only possible thing for a decent person to do is to take  it as lightly as possible. Georgie rose gallantly to the occasion, gave  a little squeal and ran from the room.    \"Down again presently,\" he called out, and had a heavy fall on the  stairs, as he went up to his bedroom. There he had a short argument  with himself. It was possible to slam"]]]
