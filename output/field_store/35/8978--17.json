But this was not meant to be.    The days turned to weeks, months and eventually years.  And, before I knew it, my interaction with rural  correspondents went on to complete half a decade. I  have since handled thousands of reports either sent to  me through post, fax, emails or even dictated over the  phone. In most cases, the reports may have initially  appeared trivial or insignificant, but a little  refinement and some cut-paste commands have succeeded  in giving a new look to the report. And with  encouraging results.    In a recent case, the Pernem correspondent sent me a  report on action initiated by the local health  authorities, in view of the outbreak of viral hepatitis  in the state. In the second last paragraph of his  report was a mention that the authorities had decided  to shut down the Pernem police station canteen for  operating under 'unhygienic conditions'. In my view,  this was most significant and I refined the story with  this angle as the lead. Taking cue from the news item,  the Director General of Police issued a memo to the  Pernem police inspector, seeking an explanation for the  unhygienic conditions in the police canteen.  Incidentally, Herald was the only English-language  daily to carry this report.    Over the years, I have not only succeeded in building  up my tolerance level to the specific demands of  correspondents, I have also learnt to appreciate the  crucial role of those eyes and ears spread all over the  state. This experience has led me to believe that a  local newspaper which ignores rural news content will  be as effective as an orchestra playing music before a  deaf audience.    While there is consensus on the value of local news  content, the importance of rural correspondents has not  always been appreciated by the powers that be in the  newspaper. A correspondent is often treated like the  spare wheel of a vehicle, detachable and to be ignored  under normal circumstances. The merit is only  recognised in times of emergency, when a big story  breaks out in areas represented by correspondents. Then  too, it is a common trend that newspapers would prefer  to send its full-fledged staffers, often from Panjim,  instead of relying on part-time rural correspondents,  to cover the event. This is not to suggest that  full-fledged staffers have no right to tresspass on the  territory of correspondents, as it were. Rather, a  staffer would benefit a great deal by utilising the  expertise and local knowledge of a rural correspondent  to ensure an effective story.    To cite an example, a staffer was recently asked to  interview noted people in connection with a prominent  cultural festival in a village. The staffer was unaware  that the same festival is celebrated separately by two  groups in the village and, that, the article would need  to carry the comments of people from both groups.  Instead of seeking the assistance of a correspondent  from the area, the staffer went ahead and interviewed  five persons from the village. Eventually, the staffer  realised that four persons interviewed represented one  group, while the sole personality interviewed from the  other group went on to criticise his own group! The  article was published and the damage was done.  Organisers of the second group were aggrieved and  threatened to withdraw advertisements to the newspaper.  The issue was finally resolved when the local  correspondent carried a series of reports to clarify  the position of the organisers of the second group. Had  the staffer sought the assistence of the local  correspondent, the issue would never have been blown  out of proportion.    Then again, the 'who-has-written' preference over the  'what-has-been-written' has plagued many  English-language newspapers and this has largely  contributed to the 'City-Centric Syndrome'. There have  been instances to suggest that a news report filed by a  staffer has been accorded more prominence -- both in  space and display -- than a report sent by a rural  correspondent. Recently, tension flared up along the Tuyem  -Camurlim ferry route, after the river navigation  department wanted to shift the lone ferry to Tar-Siolim  for the five-day Ganesh immersion ceremony. An MLA,  sarpanchas of two village panchayats and over angry 200  people prevented the movement of the ferry. The  correspondent promptly sent the report and the item  could only find place in the lower portion of page 7,  normally reserved for routine and unimportant news items.    The controversy then erupted again for the nine-day  Ganesh immersion ceremony, when authorities finally  shifted the lone ferry from the Tuyem-Camurlim route to  Siolim. Commuters were unhappy to travel by the free  canoe service, while those travelling in vehicles were  forced to take a lengthy detour. On the other hand,  people in Siolim had the luxury of a ferry to assist  them in a religious ceremony. The correspondent sent me  the report but, this time, the item was published on  page 4, normally reserved for stories which have been  continued from page 1. Incidentally, six of the eight  news items which appeared on page 3 -- the most popular  'inside' page for Goa news -- were Margao-based news  items. \"At least, you people carried the ferry story. I  sent the same story to my newspaper. But I did not find  my story anywhere in the paper the next day,\" remarked  an unhappy correspondent of another newspaper.    Newspaper authorities tend to justify this  'City-Centric Syndrome' by claiming that their readers  are concentrated in and around cities and towns and,  hence, an urban-based report would generate more  interest than a remote village-based story. To accept  this argument would be similar to assume that a  nutritional and tasty meal is possible merely with a  generous portion of rice, minus the curry, vegetables  and other side dishes.    Reports by rural correspondents add spice, flavour and  variety to a newspaper. It is no wonder that the  popularity of vernacular papers in Goa has been largely  due to the quality and quantity of local stories, both  from urban and rural areas.    Different standards adopted with rural correspondents  can be quite effective to confuse and demoralise them.  In one incident, a rural correspondent sent me a report  stating that a building constructed by a firm and owned  by an MLA, was being built barely metres from a high  tension pole. A labourer while at work accidentally  came in contact with the live wires and was seriously  injured. Though a police complaint was filed against  the firm and not the MLA, the correspondent was keen to  establish the link since since the MLA was largely  responsible for the negligence. However, the editor  pulled up the correspondent for attempting to introduce  the MLA into the story, when the police complaint did  not specify the direct involvement of the MLA.    Sometime later, the sister of a minister fatally  stabbed her husband to death. Though the minister was  not involved as he was abroad at the time of the  incident, the same editor called up the news desk,  asking them to insert the statement that the alleged  murderer is the sister of the minister. The minister's  identity was not specified in the police complaint and,  yet, the editor wanted to establish the link between  the minister and his sister.    The problems faced by rural correspondents are fairly  common and are not restricted to any one newspaper and  it has become a common trend for local correspondents  to pool in stories and resources. This in turn has led  to the creation of local level associations, commonly  known as \"Patrakar Sangh\" in most talukas of the State.  These associations have, in turn, branched out into  constituency-level associations. At present, the  numerous \"Patrakar Sanghs\" in Goa include the  Sanguem-Quepem Patrakar Sangh, Sanguem Patrakar Sangh,  Murgao Patrakar Sangh, Pernem Patrakar Sangh, Mandrem  Patrakar Sangh, Bicholim Patrakar Sangh and the  Bardez-based Zunzar Gramin Patrakar Sangh. Besides  safeguarding the interests of rural correspondents,  these associations provide support to its members and  also promote interactions with society by organising  various contests and cultural programmes.    Having served correspondents across two newspapers for  over half a decade, I have grown to appreciate and  respect their enthusiasm to the profession, despite the  difficulties that engulf them on a regular basis. If my  efforts have paid rich dividends, it is largely based  on my recipe called T.R.U.S.T, which includes the key  ingredients of Talent, Reliability, Usefulness,  Sincerity and Tenacity.    TALENT: Rural correspondents have often been judged by  their talent in the collection of news from their  respective areas. It is this talent that has enthused  many correspondents to remain in journalism for many  years, even though in most cases, monetary benefits  have been too meagre to justify their interest.    I have often worked with rural correspondents who have  little knowledge of English and, yet, they have  communicated to me stories which have turned out to be  impressive reports. There have been some correspondents  who have developed such strong contacts, that they are  easily identified by the masses in different parts of  the taluka represented by the correspondent. These  correspondents are the true representatives of the  newspaper in their areas.    Correspondents with remarkable talent have always  remained the prized possession of a newspaper and, in  many cases, have gone on to become full-fledged reporters.    RELIABILITY: By and large, rural correspondents have  been a reliable lot and have stood by the paper in good  times and in bad. These correspondents have sent in  their reports all year round, without taking into  account their weekly holidays, public holidays or  annual leave.

Have I guessed aright?      How slew you single-handed that fell beast?      How came it among rivered Nemea's glens?      For none such monster could the eagerest eye      Find in all Greece: Greece harbours bear and boar,      And deadly wolf: but not this larger game.      'Twas this that made his listeners marvel then:      They deemed he told them travellers' tales, to win      By random words applause from standers-by.\"        Then Phyleus from the mid-road edged away,      That both might walk abreast, and he might catch      More at his ease what fell from Heracles:      Who journeying now alongside thus began:--          \"On the prior matter, O Augeas' child,      Thine own unaided wit hath ruled aright.      But all that monster's history, how it fell,      Fain would I tell thee who hast ears to hear,      Save only whence it came: for none of all      The Argive host could read that riddle right.      Some god, we dimly guessed, our niggard vows      Resenting, had upon Phoroneus' realm      Let loose this very scourge of humankind.      On peopled Pisa plunging like a flood      The brute ran riot: notably it cost      Its neighbours of Bembina woes untold.      And here Eurystheus bade me try my first      Passage of arms, and slay that fearsome thing.      So with my buxom bow and quiver lined      With arrows I set forth: my left hand held      My club, a beetling olive's stalwart trunk      And shapely, still environed in its bark:      This hand had torn from holiest Helicon      The tree entire, with all its fibrous roots.      And finding soon the lion's whereabouts,      I grasped my bow, and on the bent horn slipped      The string, and laid thereon the shaft of death.      And, now all eyes, I watched for that fell thing,      In hopes to view him ere he spied out me.      But midday came, and nowhere could I see      One footprint of the beast or hear his roar:      And, trust me, none appeared of whom to ask,      Herdsman or labourer, in the furrowed lea;      For wan dismay kept each man in his hut.      Still on I footed, searching through and through      The leafy mountain-passes, till I saw      The creature, and forthwith essayed my strength.      Gorged from some gory carcass, on he stalked      At eve towards his lair; his grizzled mane,      Shoulders, and grim glad visage, all adrip      With carnage; and he licked his bearded lips.      I, crouched among the shadows of the trees      On the green hill-top, waited his approach,      And as he came I aimed at his left flank.      The barbed shaft sped idly, nor could pierce      The flesh, but glancing dropped on the green grass.      He, wondering, raised forthwith his tawny head,      And ran his eyes o'er all the vicinage,      And snarled and gave to view his cavernous throat.      Meanwhile I levelled yet another shaft,      Ill pleased to think my first had fled in vain.      In the mid-chest I smote him, where the lungs      Are seated: still the arrow sank not in,      But fell, its errand frustrate, at his feet.      Once more was I preparing, sore chagrined,      To draw the bowstring, when the ravenous beast      Glaring around espied me, lashed his sides      With his huge tail, and opened war at once.      Swelled his vast neck, his dun locks stood on end      With rage: his spine moved sinuous as a bow,      Till all his weight hung poised on flank and loin.      And e'en as, when a chariot-builder bends      With practised skill his shafts of splintered fig,      Hot from the fire, to be his axle-wheels;      Flies the tough-rinded sapling from the hands      That shape it, at a bound recoiling far:      So from far-off the dread beast, all of a heap,      Sprang on me, hungering for my life-blood. I      Thrust with one hand my arrows in his face      And my doffed doublet, while the other raised      My seasoned cudgel o'er his crest, and drave      Full at his temples, breaking clean in twain      On the fourfooted warrior's airy scalp      My club; and ere he reached me, down he fell.      Headlong he fell, and poised on tremulous feet      Stood, his head wagging, and his eyes grown dim;      For the shrewd stroke had shattered brain and bone.      I, marking him beside himself with pain.      Fell, ere recovering he should breathe again,      At vantage on his solid sinewy neck,      My bow and woven quiver thrown aside.      With iron clasp I gripped him from the rear      (His talons else had torn me) and, my foot      Set on him, forced to earth by dint of heel      His hinder parts, my flanks entrenched the while      Behind his fore-arm; till his thews were stretched      And strained, and on his haunches stark he stood      And lifeless; hell received his monstrous ghost.      Then with myself I counselled how to strip      From off the dead beast's limbs his shaggy hide,      A task full onerous, since I found it proof      Against all blows of steel or stone or wood.      Some god at last inspired me with the thought,      With his own claws to rend the lion's skin.      With these I flayed him soon, and sheathed and armed      My limbs against the shocks of murderous war.      Thus, sir, the Nemean lion met his end,      Erewhile the constant curse of beast and man.\"          IDYLL XXVI.      The Bacchanals.          Agave of the vermeil-tinted cheek          And Ino and Autonoae marshalled erst        Three bands of revellers under one hill-peak.          They plucked the wild-oak's matted foliage first,        Lush ivy then, and creeping asphodel;      And reared therewith twelve shrines amid the untrodden fell:          To Semele three, to Dionysus nine.          Next, from a vase drew offerings subtly wrought,        And prayed and placed them on each fresh green shrine;          So by the god, who loved such tribute, taught.        Perched on the sheer cliff, Pentheus could espy      All, in a mastick hoar ensconced that grew thereby.        Autonoae marked him, and with, frightful cries          Flew to make havoc of those mysteries weird        That must not be profaned by vulgar eyes.          Her frenzy frenzied all. Then Pentheus feared        And fled: and in his wake those damsels three,      Each with her trailing robe up-gathered to the knee.          \"What will ye, dames,\" quoth Pentheus. \"Thou shalt guess          At what we mean, untold,\" Autonoae said.        Agave moaned--so moans a lioness          Over her young one--as she clutched his head:        While Ino on the carcass fairly laid      Her heel, and wrenched away shoulder and shoulder-blade.          Autonoae's turn came next: and what remained          Of flesh their damsels did among them share,        And back to Thebes they came all carnage-stained,          And planted not a king but aching there.        Warned by this tale, let no man dare defy      Great Bacchus; lest a death more awful he should die,          And when he counts nine years or scarcely ten,          Rush to his ruin. May I pass my days      Uprightly, and be loved of upright men!          And take this motto, all who covet praise:        ('Twas AEgis-bearing Zeus that spake it first:)      'The godly seed fares well: the wicked's is accurst.'          Now bless ye Bacchus, whom on mountain snows,          Prisoned in his thigh till then, the Almighty laid.        And bless ye fairfaced Semele, and those          Her sisters, hymned of many a hero-maid,        Who wrought, by Bacchus fired, a deed which none      May gainsay--who shall blame that which a god hath done?

Nay the true Helen's just now kissing me.        THE MAIDEN.      Satyr, ne'er boast: 'what's idler than a kiss?'        DAPHNIS.      Yet in such pleasant idling there is bliss.        THE MAIDEN.      I'll wash my mouth: where go thy kisses then?        DAPHNIS.      Wash, and return it--to be kissed again.        THE MAIDEN.      Go kiss your oxen, and not unwed maids.        DAPHNIS.      Ne'er boast; for beauty is a dream that fades.        THE MAIDEN.      Past grapes are grapes: dead roses keep their smell.        DAPHNIS.      Come to yon olives: I have a tale to tell.        THE MAIDEN.      Not I: you fooled me with smooth words before.        DAPHNIS.      Come to yon elms, and hear me pipe once more.        THE MAIDEN.      Pipe to yourself: your piping makes me cry.        DAPHNIS.      A maid, and flout the Paphian? Fie, oh fie!        THE MAIDEN.      She's naught to me, if Artemis' favour last.        DAPHNIS.      Hush, ere she smite you and entrap you fast.        THE MAIDEN.      And let her smite me, trap me as she will!        DAPHNIS.      Your Artemis shall be your saviour still?        THE MAIDEN.      Unhand me! What, again? I'll tear your lip.        DAPHNIS.      Can you, could damsel e'er, give Love the slip?        THE MAIDEN.      You are his bondslave, but not I by Pan!        DAPHNIS.      I doubt he'll give thee to a worser man.        THE MAIDEN.      Many have wooed me, but I fancied none.        DAPHNIS.      Till among many came the destined _one_.        THE MAIDEN.      Wedlock is woe. Dear lad, what can I do?        DAPHNIS.      Woe it is not, but joy and dancing too.        THE MAIDEN.      Wives dread their husbands: so I've heard it said.        DAPHNIS.      Nay, they rule o'er them. What does woman dread?        THE MAIDEN.      Then children--Eileithya's dart is keen.        DAPHNIS.      But the deliverer, Artemis, is your queen.        THE MAIDEN.      And bearing children all our grace destroys.        DAPHNIS.
