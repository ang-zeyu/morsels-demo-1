[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10002"],[0,"The House on the Borderland (#16)"],[1," lies far down in the earth, beneath  this old house? Under this house! Even now, the idea is strange and  terrible to me. For I have proved, beyond doubt, that the Pit yawns  right below the house, which is evidently supported, somewhere above the  center of it, upon a tremendous, arched roof, of solid rock.    It happened in this wise, that, having occasion to go down to the  cellars, the thought occurred to me to pay a visit to the great vault,  where the trap is situated; and see whether everything was as I had  left it.    Reaching the place, I walked slowly up the center, until I came to the  trap. There it was, with the stones piled upon it, just as I had seen it  last. I had a lantern with me, and the idea came to me, that now would  be a good time to investigate whatever lay under the great, oak slab.  Placing the lantern on the floor, I tumbled the stones off the trap,  and, grasping the ring, pulled the door open. As I did so, the cellar  became filled with the sound of a murmurous thunder, that rose from far  below. At the same time, a damp wind blew up into my face, bringing  with it a load of fine spray. Therewith, I dropped the trap, hurriedly,  with a half frightened feeling of wonder.    For a moment, I stood puzzled. I was not particularly afraid. The  haunting fear of the Swine-things had left me, long ago; but I was  certainly nervous and astonished. Then, a sudden thought possessed me,  and I raised the ponderous door, with a feeling of excitement. Leaving  it standing upon its end, I seized the lantern, and, kneeling down,  thrust it into the opening. As I did so, the moist wind and spray drove  in my eyes, making me unable to see, for a few moments. Even when my  eyes were clear, I could distinguish nothing below me, save darkness,  and whirling spray.    Seeing that it was useless to expect to make out anything, with the  light so high, I felt in my pockets for a piece of twine, with which to  lower it further into the opening. Even as I fumbled, the lantern  slipped from my fingers, and hurtled down into the darkness. For a brief  instant, I watched its fall, and saw the light shine on a tumult of  white foam, some eighty or a hundred feet below me. Then it was gone. My  sudden surmise was correct, and now, I knew the cause of the wet and  noise. The great cellar was connected with the Pit, by means of the  trap, which opened right above it; and the moisture, was the spray,  rising from the water, falling into the depths.    In an instant, I had an explanation of certain things, that had  hitherto puzzled me. Now, I could understand why the noises--on the  first night of the invasion--had seemed to rise directly from under my  feet. And the chuckle that had sounded when first I opened the trap!  Evidently, some of the Swine-things must have been right beneath me.    Another thought struck me. Were the creatures all drowned? Would they  drown? I remembered how unable I had been to find any traces to show  that my shooting had been really fatal. Had they life, as we understand  life, or were they ghouls? These thoughts flashed through my brain, as I  stood in the dark, searching my pockets for matches. I had the box in my  hand now, and, striking a light, I stepped to the trap door, and closed  it. Then, I piled the stones back upon it; after which, I made my way  out from the cellars.    And so, I suppose the water goes on, thundering down into that  bottomless hell-pit. Sometimes, I have an inexplicable desire to go down  to the great cellar, open the trap, and gaze into the impenetrable,  spray-damp darkness. At times, the desire becomes almost overpowering,  in its intensity. It is not mere curiosity, that prompts me; but more as  though some unexplained influence were at work. Still, I never go; and  intend to fight down the strange longing, and crush it; even as I would  the unholy thought of self-destruction.    This idea of some intangible force being exerted, may seem reasonless.  Yet, my instinct warns me, that it is not so. In these things, reason  seems to me less to be trusted than instinct.    One thought there is, in closing, that impresses itself upon me, with  ever growing insistence. It is, that I live in a very strange house; a  very awful house. And I have begun to wonder whether I am doing wisely  in staying here. Yet, if I left, where could I go, and still obtain the  solitude, and the sense of her presence,[1] that alone make my old  life bearable?        _XIV_    THE SEA OF SLEEP    For a considerable period after the last incident which I have narrated  in my diary, I had serious thoughts of leaving this house, and might  have done so; but for the great and wonderful thing, of which I am  about to write.    How well I was advised, in my heart, when I stayed on here--spite of  those visions and sights of unknown and unexplainable things; for, had I  not stayed, then I had not seen again the face of her I loved. Yes,  though few know it, none now save my sister Mary, I have loved and,  ah! me--lost.    I would write down the story of those sweet, old days; but it would be  like the tearing of old wounds; yet, after that which has happened, what  need have I to care? For she has come to me out of the unknown.  Strangely, she warned me; warned me passionately against this house;  begged me to leave it; but admitted, when I questioned her, that she  could not have come to me, had I been elsewhere. Yet, in spite of this,  still she warned me, earnestly; telling me that it was a place, long  ago given over to evil, and under the power of grim laws, of which none  here have knowledge. And I--I just asked her, again, whether she would  come to me elsewhere, and she could only stand, silent.    It was thus, that I came to the place of the Sea of Sleep--so she  termed it, in her dear speech with me. I had stayed up, in my study,  reading; and must have dozed over the book. Suddenly, I awoke and sat  upright, with a start. For a moment, I looked 'round, with a puzzled  sense of something unusual. There was a misty look about the room,  giving a curious softness to each table and chair and furnishing.    Gradually, the mistiness increased; growing, as it were, out of  nothing. Then, slowly, a soft, white light began to glow in the room.  The flames of the candles shone through it, palely. I looked from side  to side, and found that I could still see each piece of furniture; but  in a strangely unreal way, more as though the ghost of each table and  chair had taken the place of the solid article.    Gradually, as I looked, I saw them fade and fade; until, slowly, they  resolved into nothingness. Now, I looked again at the candles. They  shone wanly, and, even as I watched, grew more unreal, and so vanished.  The room was filled, now, with a soft, yet luminous, white twilight,  like a gentle mist of light. Beyond this, I could see nothing. Even the  walls had vanished.    Presently, I became conscious that a faint, continuous sound, pulsed  through the silence that wrapped me. I listened intently. It grew more  distinct, until it appeared to me that I harked to the breathings of  some great sea. I cannot tell how long a space passed thus; but, after a  while, it seemed that I could see through the mistiness; and, slowly, I  became aware that I was standing upon the shore of an immense and silent  sea. This shore was smooth and long, vanishing to right and left of me,  in extreme distances. In front, swam a still immensity of sleeping  ocean. At times, it seemed to me that I caught a faint glimmer of light,  under its surface; but of this, I could not be sure. Behind me, rose up,  to an extraordinary height, gaunt, black cliffs.    Overhead, the sky was of a uniform cold grey color--the whole place  being lit by a stupendous globe of pale fire, that swam a little above  the far horizon, and shed a foamlike light above the quiet waters.    Beyond the gentle murmur of the sea, an intense stillness prevailed.  For a long while, I stayed there, looking out across its strangeness.  Then, as I stared, it seemed that a bubble of white foam floated up out  of the depths, and then, even now I know not how it was, I was looking  upon, nay, looking _into_ the face of Her--aye! into her face--into her  soul; and she looked back at me, with such a commingling of joy and  sadness, that I ran toward her, blindly; crying strangely to her, in a  very agony of remembrance, of terror, and of hope, to come to me. Yet,  spite of my crying, she stayed out there upon the sea, and only shook  her head, sorrowfully; but, in her eyes was the old earth-light of  tenderness, that I had come to know, before all things, ere we  were parted.    \"At her perverseness, I grew desperate, and essayed to wade out to her;  yet, though I would, I could not. Something, some invisible barrier,  held me back, and I was fain to stay where I was, and cry out to her in  the fullness of my soul, 'O, my Darling, my Darling--' but could say no  more, for very intensity. And, at that, she came over, swiftly, and  touched me, and it was as though heaven had opened. Yet, when I reached  out my hands to her, she put me from her with tenderly stern hands, and  I was abashed--\"        THE FRAGMENTS[2]    (_The legible portions of the mutilated leaves_.)    ... through tears ... noise of eternity in my ears, we parted ... She  whom I love. O, my God ...!    I was a great time dazed, and then I was alone in the blackness of the  night. I knew that I journeyed back, once more, to the known universe.  Presently, I emerged from that enormous darkness. I had come among the  stars ... vast time ... the sun, far and remote.    I entered into the gulf that separates our system from the outer suns.

Superstitions rest  mostly on the surface and are not deadly in themselves. A man can be true  of heart even if he will not sit thirteen at table. But there is a kind  of fear that is disastrous to them that have it. It is the fear of the  material universe in all its manifestations. There are persons, stout both  of chest and limb, who fear drafts and wet feet. A man who is an elephant  of valor and who has been feeling this long while a gentle contempt for  such as myself, will cry out if a soft breeze strikes against his neck. If  a foot slips to the gutter and becomes wet, he will dose himself. Achilles  did not more carefully nurse his heel. For him the lofty dome of air is  packed with malignant germs. The round world is bottled with contagion. A  strong man who, in his time, might have slain the Sofi, is as fearful of  his health as though the plague were up the street. Calamities beset him.  The slightest sniffling in his nose is the trumpet for a deep disorder.  Existence is but a moving hazard. Life for him, poor fellow, is but a room  with a window on the night and a storm beating on the casement. God knows,  it is better to grow giddy on a ladder than to think that this majestic  earth is such an universal pestilence.          The Asperities of the Early British Reviewers      Book reviewers nowadays direct their attention, for the most part, to the  worthy books and they habitually neglect those that seem beneath their  regard. On a rare occasion they assail an unprofitable book, but even this  is often but a bit of practice. They swish a bludgeon to try their hand.  They only take their anger, as it were, upon an outing, lest with too  close housing it grow pallid and shrink in girth. Or maybe they indulge  themselves in humor. Perhaps they think that their pages grow dull and that  ridicule will restore the balance. They throw it in like a drunken porter  to relieve a solemn scene. I fancy that editors of this baser sort keep on  their shelves one or two volumes for their readers' sport and mirth. I read  recently a review of an historical romance--a last faltering descendant of  the race--whose author in an endeavor to restore the past, had made too  free a use of obsolete words. With what playfulness was he held up to  scorn! Mary come up, sweet chuck! How his quaint phrasing was turned  against him! What a merry fellow it is who writes, how sharp and caustic!  There's pepper on his mood.    But generally, it is said, book reviews are too flattering. Professor  Bliss Perry, being of this opinion, offered some time ago a statement  that \"Magazine writing about current books is for the most part bland,  complaisant, pulpy.... The Pedagogue no longer gets a chance at the gifted  young rascal who needs, first and foremost, a premonitory whipping; the  youthful genius simply stays away from school and carries his unwhipped  talents into the market place.\" At a somewhat different angle of the same  opinion, Dr. Crothers suggests in an essay that instead of being directed  to the best books, we need to be warned from the worst. He proposes to set  up a list of the Hundred Worst Books. For is it not better, he asks, to put  a lighthouse on a reef than in the channel? The open sea does not need a  bell-buoy to sound its depth.    On these hints I have read some of the book criticisms of days past to  learn whether they too were pulpy--whether our present silken criticism  always wore its gloves and perfumed itself, or whether it has fallen to  this smiling senility from a sterner youth. Although I am usually a rusty  student, yet by diligence I have sought to mend my knowledge that I might  lay it out before you. Lately, therefore, if you had come within our Public  Library, you would have found me in one of these attempts. Here I went,  scrimping the other business of the day in order that I might be at my  studies before the rush set in up town. Mine was the alcove farthest from  the door, where are the mustier volumes that fit a bookish student. So if  your quest was the lighter books--such verse and novels as present fame  attests--you did not find me. I was hooped and bowed around the corner. I  am no real scholar, but I study on a spurt. For a whole week together I may  read old plays until their jigging style infects my own. I have set myself  against the lofty histories, although I tire upon their lower slopes and  have not yet persisted to their upper and windier ridges. I have, also, a  pretty knowledge of the Queen Anne wits and feel that I must have dogged  and spied upon them while they were yet alive. But in general, although  I am curious in the earlier chapters of learning, I lag in the inner  windings. However, for a fortnight I have sat piled about with old reviews,  whose leather rots and smells, in order that I might study the fading  criticisms of the past.    Until rather near the end of the eighteenth century, those who made their  living in England by writing were chiefly publishers' hacks, fellows of  the Dunciad sucking their quills in garrets and selling their labor for a  crust, for the reading public was too small to support them. Or they  found a patron and gave him a sugared sonnet for a pittance, or strained  themselves to the length of an Ode for a berth in his household. Or  frequently they supported a political party and received a place in the  Red Tape Office. But even in politics, on account of the smallness of the  reading public and the politicians' indifference to its approval, their  services were of slight account. Too often a political office was granted  from a pocket borough in which a restricted electorate could be bought at a  trifling expense. To gain support inside the House of Commons was enough.  The greater public outside could be ignored. This attitude changed with  the coming of the French Revolution. Here was a new force unrealized  before--that of a crowd which, being unrepresented and with a real  grievance, could, when it liked, take a club and go after what it wanted.  For the first time in many years in England--such were the whiffs of  liberty across the Channel--the power of an unrepresented public came to be  known. It was not that the English crowd had as yet taken the club in its  hands, but there were new thoughts abroad in the world, and there was the  possibility to be regarded. To influence this larger public, therefore, men  who could write came little by little into a larger demand. And as  writers were comparatively scarce, all kinds--whether they wrote poems or  prose--were pressed into service. It is significant, too, that it was in  the decades subjected to the first influence of the French Revolution that  the English daily paper took its start as an agent to influence public  opinion.    It was therefore rather more than one hundred years ago that writers came  to a better prosperity. They came out of their garrets, took rooms on the  second floor, polished their brasses and became Persons. I can fancy that a  writer after spending a morning in the composition of a political article  on the whisper of a Cabinet Minister, wrote a sonnet after lunch, and  a book review before dinner. Let us see in what mood they took their  advancement! Let us examine their temper--but in book reviewing only, for  that alone concerns us! In doing this, we have the advantage of knowing the  final estimate of the books they judged. Like the witch, we have looked  into the seeds of time and we know \"which grain will grow and which will  not.\"    In 1802, when the Edinburgh Review (which was the first of its line to  acquire distinction) came into being, the passion of the times found voice  in politics. Both Whigs and Tories had been alarmed by the excesses of the  French Revolution; both feared that England was drifting the way of France;  each had a remedy, but opposed and violently maintained. The Tories put the  blame of the Revolution on the compromises of Louis XVI, and accordingly  they were hostile to any political change. The Whigs, on the other  hand, saw the rottenness of England as a cause that would incite her to  revolution also, and they advocated reform while yet there was time. The  general fear of a revolution gave the government of England to the Tories,  and kept them in power for several decades. And England was ripe for  trouble. The government was but nominally representative. No Catholic,  Jew, Dissenter or poor man had a vote or could hold a seat in Parliament.  Industrially and economically the country was in the condition of France  in the year of Arthur Young's journey. The poverty was abject, the relief  futile and the hatred of the poor for the rich was inflammatory.  George III, slipping into feebleness and insanity, yet jealous of his  unconstitutional power, was a vacillating despot, quarrelling with his  Commons and his Ministers. Lord Eldon as Chancellor, but with as nearly the  control of a Premier as the King would allow, was the staunch upholder of  all things that have since been disproved and discarded. Bagehot said of  him that \"he believed in everything which it is impossible to believe in.\"  France and Napoleon threatened across the narrow channel. England still  growled at the loss of her American colonies. It was as yet the England  of the old regime. The great reforms were to come thirty years later--the  Catholic Emancipation, the abolishment of slavery in the colonies, the  suppression of the pocket boroughs, the gross bribery of elections, the  cleaning of the poor laws and the courts of justice.    It was in this dark hour of English history that the writers polished their  brasses and set up as Persons. And if the leading articles that they wrote  of mornings stung and snapped with venom, it is natural that the book"]]]
