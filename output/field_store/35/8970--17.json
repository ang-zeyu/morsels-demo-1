But, of course, the temptation in  this case would be enormous. Still, I can not suspect Worsfold. Indeed,  how can I suspect anybody in the circumstances?\"    \"The other, now?\"    \"His name's Ritter. He is merely a tracer, not a fully skilled  draughtsman. He is quite a decent young fellow, and I have had him two  years. I don't consider him particularly smart, or he would have learned a  little more of his business by this time. But I don't see the least reason  to suspect him. As I said before, I can't reasonably suspect anybody.\"    \"Very well; we will get to Chancery Lane now, if you please, and you can  tell me more as we go.\"    \"I have a cab waiting. What else can I tell you?\"    \"I understand the position to be succinctly this: The drawings were in the  office when you arrived. Nobody came out, and nobody went in; and _yet_  they vanished. Is that so?\"    \"That is so. When I say that absolutely nobody came in, of course I except  the postman. He brought a couple of letters during the morning. I mean  that absolutely nobody came past the barrier in the outer office--the  usual thing, you know, like a counter, with a frame of ground glass over  it.\"    \"I quite understand that. But I think you said that the drawings were in a  drawer in your _own_ room--not the outer office, where the draughtsmen  are, I presume?\"    \"That is the case. It is an inner room, or, rather, a room parallel with  the other, and communicating with it; just as your own room is, which we  have just left.\"    \"But, then, you say you never left your office, and yet the drawings  vanished--apparently by some unseen agency--while you were there in the  room?\"    \"Let me explain more clearly.\" The cab was bowling smoothly along the  Strand, and the engineer took out a pocket-book and pencil. \"I fear,\" he  proceeded, \"that I am a little confused in my explanation--I am naturally  rather agitated. As you will see presently, my offices consist of three  rooms, two at one side of a corridor, and the other opposite--thus.\" He  made a rapid pencil sketch.    [Illustration]    \"In the outer office my men usually work. In the inner office I work  myself. These rooms communicate, as you see, by a door. Our ordinary way  in and out of the place is by the door of the outer office leading into  the corridor, and we first pass through the usual lifting flap in the  barrier. The door leading from the _inner_ office to the corridor is  always kept locked on the inside, and I don't suppose I unlock it once in  three months. It has not been unlocked all the morning. The drawer in  which the missing drawings were kept, and in which I saw them at ten  o'clock this morning, is at the place marked D; it is a large chest of  shallow drawers in which the plans lie flat.\"    \"I quite understand. Then there is the private room opposite. What of  that?\"    \"That is a sort of private sitting-room that I rarely use, except for  business interviews of a very private nature. When I said I never left my  office, I did not mean that I never stirred out of the inner office. I was  about in one room and another, both the outer and the inner offices, and  once I went into the private room for five minutes, but nobody came either  in or out of any of the rooms at that time, for the door of the private  room was wide open, and I was standing at the book-case (I had gone to  consult a book), just inside the door, with a full view of the doors  opposite. Indeed, Worsfold was at the door of the outer office most of the  short time. He came to ask me a question.\"    \"Well,\" Hewitt replied, \"it all comes to the simple first statement. You  know that nobody left the place or arrived, except the postman, who  couldn't get near the drawings, and yet the drawings went. Is this your  office?\"    The cab had stopped before a large stone building. Mr. Dixon alighted and  led the way to the first-floor. Hewitt took a casual glance round each of  the three rooms. There was a sort of door in the frame of ground glass  over the barrier to admit of speech with visitors. This door Hewitt pushed  wide open, and left so.    He and the engineer went into the inner office. \"Would you like to ask  Worsfold and Ritter any questions?\" Mr. Dixon inquired.    \"Presently. Those are their coats, I take it, hanging just to the right of  the outer office door, over the umbrella stand?\"    \"Yes, those are all their things--coats, hats, stick, and umbrella.\"    \"And those coats were searched, you say?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And this is the drawer--thoroughly searched, of course?\"    \"Oh, certainly; every drawer was taken out and turned over.\"    \"Well, of course I must assume you made no mistake in your hunt. Now tell  me, did anybody know where these plans were, beyond yourself and your two  men?\"    \"As far as I can tell, not a soul.\"    \"You don't keep an office boy?\"    \"No. There would be nothing for him to do except to post a letter now and  again, which Ritter does quite well for.\"    \"As you are quite sure that the drawings were there at ten o'clock,  perhaps the thing scarcely matters. But I may as well know if your men  have keys of the office?\"    \"Neither. I have patent locks to each door and I keep all the keys myself.  If Worsfold or Ritter arrive before me in the morning they have to wait to  be let in; and I am always present myself when the rooms are cleaned. I  have not neglected precautions, you see.\"    \"No. I suppose the object of the theft--assuming it is a theft--is pretty  plain: the thief would offer the drawings for sale to some foreign  government?\"    \"Of course. They would probably command a great sum. I have been looking,  as I need hardly tell you, to that invention to secure me a very large  fortune, and I shall be ruined, indeed, if the design is taken abroad. I  am under the strictest engagements to secrecy with the Admiralty, and not  only should I lose all my labor, but I should lose all the confidence  reposed in me at headquarters; should, in fact, be subject to penalties  for breach of contract, and my career stopped forever. I can not tell you  what a serious business this is for me. If you can not help me, the  consequences will be terrible. Bad for the service of the country, too, of  course.\"    \"Of course. Now tell me this: It would, I take it, be necessary for the  thief to _exhibit_ these drawings to anybody anxious to buy the secret--I  mean, he couldn't describe the invention by word of mouth.\"    \"Oh, no, that would be impossible. The drawings are of the most  complicated description, and full of figures upon which the whole thing  depends. Indeed, one would have to be a skilled expert to properly  appreciate the design at all. Various principles of hydrostatics,  chemistry, electricity, and pneumatics are most delicately manipulated and  adjusted, and the smallest error or omission in any part would upset the  whole. No, the drawings are necessary to the thing, and they are gone.\"    At this moment the door of the outer office was heard to open and somebody  entered. The door between the two offices was ajar, and Hewitt could see  right through to the glass door left open over the barrier and into the  space beyond. A well-dressed, dark, bushy-bearded man stood there carrying  a hand-bag, which he placed on the ledge before him. Hewitt raised his  hand to enjoin silence. The man spoke in a rather high-pitched voice and  with a slight accent. \"Is Mr. Dixon now within?\" he asked.    \"He is engaged,\" answered one of the draughtsmen; \"very particularly  engaged. I am afraid you won't be able to see him this afternoon. Can I  give him any message?\"    \"This is two--the second time I have come to-day. Not two hours ago Mr.  Dixon himself tells me to call again. I have a very important--very  excellent steam-packing to show him that is very cheap and the best of the  market.\" The man tapped his bag. \"I have just taken orders from the  largest railway companies. Can not I see him, for one second only? I will  not detain him.\"    \"Really, I'm sure you can't this afternoon; he isn't seeing anybody. But  if you'll leave your name----\"    \"My name is Hunter; but what the good of that? He ask me to call a little  later, and I come, and now he is engaged. It is a very great pity.\" And  the man snatched up his bag and walking-stick, and stalked off,  indignantly.    Hewitt stood still, gazing through the small aperture in the doorway.    \"You'd scarcely expect a man with such a name as Hunter to talk with that  accent, would you?\" he observed, musingly. \"It isn't a French accent, nor  a German; but it seems foreign. You don't happen to know him, I suppose?\"    \"No, I don't. He called here about half-past twelve, just while we were in  the middle of our search and I was frantic over the loss of the drawings.  I was in the outer office myself, and told him to call later. I have lots  of such agents here, anxious to sell all sorts of engineering appliances.  But what will you do now? Shall you see my men?\"    \"I think,\" said Hewitt, rising--\"I think I'll get you to question them  yourself.\"    \"Myself?\"    \"Yes, I have a reason. Will you trust me with the 'key' of the private  room opposite? I will go over there for a little, while you talk to your  men in this room. Bring them in here and shut the door; I can look after  the office from across the corridor, you know. Ask them each to detail his  exact movements about the office this morning, and get them to recall each  visitor who has been here from the beginning of the week. I'll let you  know the reason of this later. Come across to me in a few minutes.\"    Hewitt took the key and passed through the outer office into the corridor.    Ten minutes later Mr. Dixon, having questioned his draughtsmen, followed  him. He found Hewitt standing before the table in the private room, on  which lay several drawings on tracing-paper.

My mother got work about.    \"The first schoolhouse was a colored school. We had two rooms and two  teachers sent down from the North to teach us. If they had a white  school I didn't know it. They had one later on. I was bout grown. Mr.  Proctor and Miss Rice was the first teachers. We laughed bout em. They  was rough looking, didn't look like white folks down here we'd been used  to. They thought they sho was smart. Another teacher come down here was  Mr. Abner. White folks wouldn't have nothin' to do with em. We learned.  They learned us the ABC's and to write. I can read.

Ingram  Person interviewed: Lizzie Barnett; Conway, Arkansas  Age: 100?      \"Yes; I was born a slave. My old mammy was a slave before me. She was  owned by my old Miss, Fanny Pennington, of Nashville, Tennessee. I was  born on a plantation near there. She is dead now. I shore did love Miss  Fanny.    \"Did you have any brothers and sisters, Aunt Liz.?\"    \"Why, law yes, honey, my mammy and Miss Fanny raised dey chillun  together. Three each, and we was jes' like brothers and sisters, all  played in de same yard. No, we did not eat together. Dey sot us niggers  out in de yard to eat, but many a night I'se slept with Miss Fanny.    \"Mr. Pennington up and took de old-time consumption. Dey calls it T.B.  now. My mammy nursed him and took it from him and died before Mr. Abe  Lincoln ever sot her free.    \"I have seen hard times, Miss, I shore have.    \"In dem days when a man owned a plantation and had children and they  liked any of the little slave niggers, they were issued out to 'em just  like a horse or cow.    \"'Member, honey, when de old-time war happened between the North and  South, The Slavery War. It was so long ago I just can 'member it. Dey  had us niggers scared to death of the Bluejackets. One day a man come to  Miss Fanny's house and took a liking to me. He put me up on a block an'  he say, 'How old is dis nigger?' An' she say 'five' when she know well  an' good I was ten. No, he didn't get me. But I thought my time had  come.    \"Yes, siree, I was Miss Fanny's child. Why wouldn't I love her when I  sucked titty from her breast when my mammy was working in the field? I  shore did love Miss Fanny.    \"When de nigger war was over and dey didn't fit (fight) any longer, Abe  Lincoln sot all de niggers free and den got 'sassinated fer doin it.    \"Miss, you don't know what a hard life we slaves had, cause you ain't  old enough to 'member it. Many a time I've heard the bull whips  a-flying, and heard the awful cries of the slaves. The flesh would be  cut in great gaps and the maggits (maggots) would get in them and they  would squirm in misery.    \"I want you to know I am not on Arkansas born nigger. I come from  Tennessee. Be sure to put that down. I moved to Memphis after Miss Fanny  died.    \"While I lived in Memphis, de Yellow Fever broke out. You have never  seed the like. Everything was under quarantine. The folks died in piles  and de coffins was piled as high as a house. They buried them in  trenches, and later they dug graves and buried them. When they got to  looking into the coffins, they discovered some had turned over in dey  coffins and some had clawed dey eyes out and some had gnawed holes in  dey hands. Dey was buried alive!    \"Miss, do you believe in ha'nts? Well, if you had been in Memphis den  you would. Dey was jes' paradin' de streets at nite and you'd meet dem  comin at you round de dark corners and all de houses everywhere was  ha'nted. I've seed plenty of 'em wid my own eyes, yes, siree.    \"Yes, the times were awful in Memphis endurin the plague. Women dead  lying around and babies sucking their breasts. As soon as the frost came  and the quarantine was lifted, I came to Conway, 1867. But I am a  Tennessee nigger.    \"When I cams to Conway there were few houses to live in. No depot. I  bought this piece of land to build my shanty from Mr. Jim Harkrider for  $25.00. I worked hard for white folks and saved my money and had this  little two-room house built (mud chimney, and small porch and one small  window). It is about to fall down on me, but it will last as long as I  live. At first, I lived and cooked under a bush (brush) arbor. Cooked on  the coals in an iron skillet. Here it it, Miss.    \"Part ob de time after de nigger war (Civil) I lived in Hot Springs.  President 'Kinley had a big reservation over there and a big hospital  for the sick and wounded soldiers. Den de war broke out in Cuba and dere  was a spatch (dispatch) board what de news come over dat de war was on.  Den when dat war was over and 'Kinley was tryin to get us niggers a  slave pension dey up and 'sassinated him.    \"After Mr. Lincoln sot de slaves free, dey had Northern teachers down  South and they were called spies and all left the country.    \"I don't know 'sactly how old I am. Dey say I am 100. If Miss Fanny was  livin' she could settle it. But I have had a hard life. Yes mam. Here I  is living in my shanty, 'pendin' on my good white neighbors to feed me  and no income 'cept my Old Age Pension. Thank God for Mr. Roosevelt. I  love my Southern white friends. I am glad the North and South done shook  hands and made friends. All I has to do now is sit and look forward to  de day when I can meet my old mammy and Miss Fanny in the Glory Land.  Thank God.\"          Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Spencer Barnett (blind), Holly Grove, Ark.  Age: 81      \"I was born April 30, 1856. It was wrote in a old Bible. I am 81 years  old. I was born 3 miles from Florence, Alabama. The folks owned us was  Nancy and Mars Tom Williams. To my recollection they had John, William,  and Tom, boys; Jane, Ann, Lucy, and Emma, girls. In my family there was  13 children. My parents name Harry and Harriett Barnett.    \"Mars Tom Williams had a tanning yard. He bought hides this way: When a  fellow bring hides he would tan em then give him back half what he  brought. Then he work up the rest in shoes, harness, whoops, saddles and  sell them. The man all worked wid him and he had a farm. He raised corn,  cotton, wheat, and oats.    \"That slavery was bad. Mars Tom Williams wasn't cruel. He never broke  the skin. When the horn blowed they better be in place. They used a  twisted cowhide whoop. It was wet and tied, then it mortally would hurt.  One thing you had to be in your place day and night. It was confinin'.    \"Sunday was visiting day.    \"One man come to dinner, he hit a horse wid a rock and run way. He  missed his dinner. He come back fo dark and went tole Mars Tom. He  didn't whoop him. I was mighty little when that took place.    \"They worked on Saturday like any other day. One man fixed out the  rations. It didn't take long fer to go git em.    \"The women plowed like men in plow time. Some women made rails. When it  was cold and raining they spun and wove in the house. The men cut wood  under a shed or side the barn so it knock off the wind. Mars Tom  Williams had 12 grown men and women. I was too little to count but I  heard my folks call am over by name and number more times en I got  fingers and toes. He would hire em out to work some.    \"When freedom come on I was on Hawkin Lankford Simpson place. It was 3  or 5 miles from town. They had a big dinner-picnic close by. It was 4 or  5 day of August. A lot of soldiers come by there and said, 'You niggers  air free.' It bout broke up the picnic. The white folks broke off home.  Them wanted to go back went, them didn't struck off gone wild. Miss Lucy  and Mr. Bob Barnett give all of em stayed some corn and a little money.  Then he paid off at the end of the year. Then young master went and  rented at Dilly Hunt place. We stayed wid him 3 or 4 years then we went  to a place he bought. Tom Barnett come to close to Little Rock. Mars  William started and died on the way in Memphis. We come on wid the  family. Guess they are all dead now. Wisht I know or could find em. Tom  never married. He was a soldier. One of the boys died fo the war  started.    \"My brother Joe married Luvenia Omsted and Lewis Omsted married my  sister Betsy and Mars Tom Williams swapped the women. My ma was a cook  for the white folks how I come to know so much bout it all. Boys wore  loose shirts till they was nine or ten years old. The shirt come to the  calf of the leg. No belt.    \"We had plenty common eating. They had a big garden and plenty milk.  They cooked wid the eggs mostly. They would kill a beef and have a week  of hog killing. They would kill the beef the hardest weather that come.  The families cooked at night and on Sunday at the log cabins. They cook  at night for all next day. The old men hauled wood.    \"When I was a little boy I could hear men runnin' the slaves wid hounds  in the mountains. The landmen paid paddyrollers to keep track of slaves.  Keep em home day and night.    \"We took turns bout going to white church. We go in washin' at the creek  and put on clean clothes. She learned me a prayer. Old mistress learned  me to say it nights I slept up at the house. I still can say it:      'Now I lay me down to sleep     I pray the Lord my soul to keep"]]]
