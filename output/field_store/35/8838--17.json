And as it  struck the fire even the smoke began to die out.    \"It's going out!\" exclaimed Harry. \"Oh, I hope it keeps on raining!\"    Soon there was even no more smoke!    \"It's out!\" called John, a little later. \"That was a lucky storm for  us.\"        CHAPTER XVI    THE FLOOD    The heavy downpour of rain had ceased now, and everybody ran to the  barn to see what damage the fire had done.    \"It almost caught my pigeon coop!\" said Harry, as he examined the  blackened beams in the barn near the wire cage his birds lived in.    \"The entire back of this barn will have to be rebuilt,\" said Uncle  Daniel. \"John, are you sure you didn't drop a match in the hay?\"    \"Positive, sir!\" answered John. \"I never use a match while I'm working.  Didn't even have one in my clothes.\"    Bert whispered something to Harry. It was too much to have John blamed  for their wrongdoing.    \"Father!\" said Harry bravely, but with tears in his eyes. \"It was our  fault; we set the barn afire!\"    \"What!\" exclaimed Uncle Daniel in surprise. \"You boys set the barn  afire!\"    \"Yes,\" spoke up Bert. \"It was mostly my fault. I threw the cigarette  away and we couldn't find it.\"    \"Cigarette!\" exclaimed Uncle Daniel. \"What!--you boys smoking!\"    Both Bert and Harry started to cry. They were not used to being spoken  to like that, and of course they realized how much it cost to put that  nasty old cigarette in their mouths. Besides there might have been a  great deal more damage if it hadn't been for the rain.    \"Come with me!\" Uncle Daniel said; \"we must find out how all this  happened,\" and he led the unhappy boys into the coach house, where they  all sat down on a bench.    \"Now, Harry, stop your crying, and tell me about it,\" the father  commanded.    Harry tried to obey, but his tears choked him. Bert was the first able  to speak.    \"Oh, Uncle Daniel,\" he cried, \"we really didn't mean to smoke. We only  rolled up some corn silk in a piece of paper and--\"    His tears choked back his words now, and Harry said:    \"It was I who rolled the cigarette, father, and it was awful, it almost  made us sick. Then when Bert put it in his mouth--\"    \"I threw it away and it must have fallen in the hay!\" said Bert.    \"Why didn't you come and tell me?\" questioned Uncle Daniel severely.  \"It was bad enough to do all that, but worse to take the risk of fire!\"    \"Well, the storm was coming,\" Harry answered, \"and we went to help John  with the hay!\"    \"Now, boys,\" said Uncle Daniel, \"this has been a very serious lesson to  you and one which you will remember all your lives. I need not punish  you any more; you have suffered enough from the fright of that awful  fire. And if it hadn't been that you were always pretty good boys the  Lord would not have sent that shower to save us as He did.\"    \"I bet I'll never smoke again as long as I live,\" said Harry  determinedly through his tears.    \"Neither will I,\" Bert said firmly, \"and I'll try to make other fellows  stop if I can.\"    \"All right,\" answered Uncle Daniel, \"I'm sure you mean that, and don't  forget to thank the Lord to-night for helping us as He did. And you  must ask His pardon too for doing wrong, remember.\"    This ended the boys' confession, but they could not stop crying for a  long time, and Bert felt so sick and nervous he went to bed without  eating any supper. Uncle Daniel gave orders that no one should refer to  the fire or cause the boys any more worry, as they were both really  very nervous from the shock, so that beyond helping John clear things  up in the burned end of the barn, there was no further reference to the  boys' accident.    Next day it rained very hard--in fact, it was one of those storms that  come every summer and do not seem to know when to go away.    \"The gate at the sawmill dam is closed,\" Harry told Bert, \"and if the  pond gets any higher they won't be able to cross the plank to open up  the gate and let the water out.\"    \"That would be dangerous, wouldn't it?\" Bert asked.    \"Very,\" replied Harry. \"Peter Burns' house is right in line with the  dam at the other side of the plank, and if the dam should ever burst  that house would be swept away.\"    \"And the barn and henhouse are nearer the pond than the house even!\"  Bert remarked. \"It would be an awful loss for a poor man.\"    \"Let's go up in the attic and see how high the pond is,\" Harry  suggested.    From the top of the house the boys could see across the high pond bank  into the water.    \"My!\" Bert exclaimed; \"isn't it awful!\"    \"Yes, it is,\" Harry replied. \"You see, all the streams from the  mountains wash into this pond, and in a big storm like this it gets  very dangerous.\"    \"Why do they build houses in such dangerous places?\" asked Bert.    \"Oh, you see, that house of Burns' has stood there maybe one hundred  years--long before any dam was put in the pond to work the sawmill,\"  said Harry.    \"Oh, that's it--is it?\" Bert replied. \"I thought it was queer to put  houses right in line with a dam.\"    \"See how strong the water is getting,\" went on Harry. \"Look at that big  log floating down.\"    \"It will be fun when it stops raining,\" remarked Bert. \"We can sail  things almost anywhere.\"    \"Yes, I've seen the pond come right up across the road down at Hopkins'  once,\" Harry told his cousins. \"That was when it had rained a whole  week without stopping.\"    \"Say,\" called Dinah from the foot of the stairs. \"You boys up there  better get your boots on and look after that Frisky cow. John's gone  off somewhere, and dat calf am crying herself sick out in de barn.  Maybe she a-gettin' drownded.\"    It did not take long to get their boots and overcoats on and hurry out  to the barn.    \"Sure enough, she is getting drownded!\" exclaimed Harry, as they saw  the poor little calf standing in water up to her knees.    \"Where is all the water coming from?\" asked Bert.    \"I don't know,\" Harry answered, \"unless the tank upstairs has  overflowed.\"    The boys ran up the stairs and found, just as Harry thought, the tank  that supplied all the barns with water, and which also gave a supply  for the house to be used on the lawn, was flowing over.    \"Is there any way of letting it out?\" asked Bert, quite frightened.    \"We can open all the faucets, besides dipping out pailfuls,\" said  Harry. \"But I wish John would get back.\"    Harry ran to get the big water pail, while Bert turned on the faucet at  the outside of the barn, the one in the horse stable, another that  supplied water for the chickens and ducks, and the one John used for  carriage washing. Frisky, of course, had been moved to a dry corner and  now stopped crying.    Harry gathered all the large water pails he could carry, and hurried up  to the tank followed by Bert.    \"It has gone down already,\" said Harry, as they looked into the tank  again. \"But we had better dip out all we can, to make sure. Lucky we  found it as soon as we did, for there are all father's tools on the  bench right under the tank, besides all those new paints that have just  been opened.\"    \"Here comes John now,\" said Bert, as he heard the barn door open and  shut again.    \"Come up here, John!\" called Harry; \"we're almost flooded out. The tank  overflowed.\"    \"It did!\" exclaimed John. \"Gracious! I hope nothing is spoiled.\"    \"Oh, we just caught it in tine,\" Harry told him, \"and we opened up the  faucets as soon as we could. Then we began dipping out, to make sure.\"    \"You were smart boys this time,\" John told him, \"and saved a lot of  trouble by being so prompt to act. There is going to be a flood sure.  The dam is roaring like Niagara, and they haven't opened the gates yet.\"    \"I'm glad we are up high,\" Bert remarked, for he had never seen a  country flood before, and was a good deal frightened at the prospect.    \"Hey, John!\" called Freddie from the back porch. \"Hey, bring me some  more nails, will you? I need them for my ark.\"    \"He's building an ark!\" laughed Bert. \"Guess we'll need it all right if  this keeps on.\"    Harry got some nails from his toolbox in the carriage house, and the  boys went up to the house.    There they found Freddie on the hard cement cellar floor, nailing  boards together as fast as his little hammer could drive the nails in.    \"How's that?\" asked the little fellow, standing up the raft.    \"I guess that will float,\" said Bert, \"and when it stops raining we can  try  it.\"    \"I'm going to make a regular ark like the play one I've got home,\" said  Freddie, \"only mine will be a big one with room for us all, besides  Frisky, Snoop, Fluffy, and--\"    \"Old Bill. We'll need a horse to tow us back when the water goes down,\"  laughed Harry.    Freddie went on working as seriously as if he really expected to be a  little Noah and save all the people from the flood.    \"My, but it does rain!\" exclaimed somebody on the front porch.    It was Uncle Daniel, who had just returned from the village, soaking  wet.    \"They can't open the gates,\" Uncle Daniel told Aunt Sarah. \"They let  the water get so high the planks sailed away and now they can't get  near the dam.\"    \"That is bad for the poor Burns family!\" exclaimed Aunt Sarah. \"I had  better have John drive me down and see if they need anything.\"  \"I  stopped in on my way up,\" Uncle Daniel told her, \"and they were about  ready to move out. We'll bring them up here if it gets any worse.\"    \"Why don't they go to the gates in a boat?\" asked Bert.    \"Why, my dear boy,\" said Uncle Daniel, \"anybody who would go near that  torrent in a boat might as well jump off the bridge. The falls are  twenty-five feet high, and the water seems to have built them up twice  that. If one went within two hundred feet of the dam the surging water  would carry him over.\"    \"You see,\" said Harry, explaining it further, \"there is like a window  in the falls, a long low door. When this is opened the water is drawn  down under and does not all have to go over the falls.\"    \"And if there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],[0,"The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#15)"],[1,"d, our  public works retarded, our private enterprises of different kinds  abandoned, and thousands of useful laborers thrown out of employment and  reduced to want.\"  Further than this, the financial credit of the Nation  was at zero.  It was financially bankrupt before the close of Buchanan's  Presidential term.                                        CHAPTER IV.                              POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY.    But now occurred the great Presidential struggle of 1860--which  involved not alone the principles of Protection, but those of human  Freedom, and the preservation of the Union itself--between Abraham  Lincoln of Illinois, the candidate of the Republican party, as against  Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, the National or Douglas-Democratic  candidate, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, the Administration or  Breckinridge-Democratic candidate, and John Bell of Tennessee, the  candidate of the Bell-Union party.  The great preliminary struggle which  largely influenced the determination of the Presidential political  conflict of 1860, had, however, taken place in the State of Illinois,  two years previously.  To that preliminary political contest of 1858,  therefore, we will now turn our eyes--and, in order to fully understand  it, it may be well to glance back over a few years.  In 1851 the  Legislature of Illinois had adopted--[The vote in the House being 65  yeas to 4 nays.]--the following resolution: \"Resolved, That our Liberty  and Independence are based upon the right of the people to form for  themselves such a government as they may choose; that this great  principle, the birthright of freemen, the gift of Heaven, secured to us  by the blood of our ancestors, ought to be secured to future  generations, and no limitation ought to be applied to this power in the  organization of any Territory of the United States, of either  Territorial Government or State Constitution, provided the government so  established shall be Republican and in conformity with the Constitution  of the United States.\"  This resolution was a practical endorsement of  the course of Stephen A. Douglas in supporting the Compromise measures  of 1850, which he had defended as being \"all founded upon the great  principle that every people ought to possess the right to form and  regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way,\" and that  \"the same principle\" should be \"extended to all of the Territories of  the United States.\"    In accordance with his views and the resolution aforesaid, Mr. Douglas  in 1854, as we have already seen, incorporated in the Kansas-Nebraska  Bill a clause declaring it to be \"the true intent and meaning of the Act  not to legislate Slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it  therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and  regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to  the Constitution of the United States.\"    His position, as stated by himself, was, substantially that the  Lecompton Pro-Slavery Constitution was a fraud upon the people of  Kansas, in that it did not embody the will of that people; and he denied  the right of Congress to force a Constitution upon an unwilling people  --without regard, on his part, to whether that Constitution allowed or  prohibited Slavery or any other thing, whether good or bad.  He held  that the people themselves were the sole judges of whether it is good or  bad, and whether desirable or not.    The Supreme Court of the United States had in the meantime made a  decision in a case afterward known as the \"Dred Scott case,\" which was  held back until after the Presidential election of 1856 had taken place,  and added fuel to the political fire already raging.  Dred Scott was a  Negro Slave.  His owner voluntarily took him first into a Free State,  and afterward into a Territory which came within the Congressional  prohibitive legislation aforesaid.  That decision in brief was  substantially that no Negro Slave imported from Africa, nor his  descendant, can be a citizen of any State within the meaning of the  Constitution; that neither the Congress nor any Territorial Legislature  has under the Constitution of the United States, the power to exclude  Slavery from any Territory of the United States; and that it is for the  State Courts of the Slave State, into which the negro has been conveyed  by his master, and not for the United States Courts, to decide whether  that Negro, having been held to actual Slavery in a Free State, has, by  virtue of residence in such State, himself become Free.    Now it was, that the meaning of the words, \"subject only to the  Constitution,\" as used in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, began to be  discerned.  For if the people of a Territory were to be \"perfectly  free,\" to deal with Slavery as they chose, \"subject only to the  Constitution\" they were by this Judicial interpretation of that  instrument \"perfectly free\" to deal with Slavery in any way so long as  they did not attempt \"to exclude\" it!  The thing was all one-sided.  Mr. Douglas's attitude in inventing the peculiar phraseology in the  Kansas-Nebraska Act--which to some seemed as if expressly \"made to  order\" for the Dred Scott decision--was criticized with asperity; the  popularity, however, of his courageous stand against President Buchanan  on the Lecompton fraud, seemed to make it certain that, his term in the  United States Senate being about to expire, he would be overwhelmingly  re-elected to that body.    But at this juncture occurred something, which for a long time held the  result in doubt, and drew the excited attention of the whole Nation to  Illinois as the great battle-ground.  In 1858 a Republican State  Convention was held at Springfield, Ill., which nominated Abraham  Lincoln as the Republican candidate for United States Senator to succeed  Senator Douglas in the National Legislature.  On June 16th--after such  nomination--Mr. Lincoln made to the Convention a speech--in which, with  great and incisive power, he assailed Mr. Douglas's position as well as  that of the whole Democratic Pro-Slavery Party, and announced in compact  and cogent phrase, from his own point of view, the attitude, upon the  Slavery question, of the Republican Party.    In that remarkable speech--which at once attracted the attention of the  Country--Mr. Lincoln said: \"We are now far into the fifth year, since a  policy was initiated with the avowed object, and confident promise, of  putting an end to Slavery agitation.  Under the operation of that  policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly  augmented.  In my opinion it will not cease, until a crisis shall have  been reached and passed.  'A House divided against itself cannot stand.'  I believe this Government cannot endure permanently half Slave and half  Free.  I do not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not expect the  House to fall--but I do expect it will cease to be divided.  It will  become all one thing, or all the other.  Either the opponents of Slavery  will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind  shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate  extinction; or its advocates will push it forward, till it shall become  alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as  South.\"         [Governor Seward's announcement of an \"irrepressible conflict\" was       made four months later.]    He then proceeded to lay bare and closely analyze the history of all  that had been done, during the four years preceding, to produce the  prevailing condition of things touching human Slavery; describing it as  resulting from that, \"now almost complete legal combination-piece of  machinery, so to speak--compounded of the Nebraska doctrine and the Dred  Scott decision.\"  After stating the several points of that decision, and  that the doctrine of the \"Sacred right of self-government\" had been  perverted by the Nebraska \"Squatter Sovereignty,\" argument to mean that,  \"if any one man chose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed  to object,\" he proceeded to show the grounds upon which he charged  \"pre-concert\" among the builders of that machinery.  Said he: \"The people  were to be left perfectly free, 'subject only to the Constitution.'  What the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders could not see.  Plainly enough now, it was an exactly fitted niche for the Dred Scott  decision to afterward come in and declare the perfect freedom of the  people to be just no freedom at all.  Why was the amendment, expressly  declaring the right of the people, voted down?  Plainly enough now, the  adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision.  Why was the Court decision held up?  Why even a Senator's individual  opinion withheld, till after the Presidential election?  Plainly enough  now: the speaking out then would have damaged the 'perfectly free'  argument upon which the election was to be carried.  Why the outgoing  President's felicitation on the indorsement?  Why the delay of a  re-argument?  Why the incoming President's advance exhortation in favor of  the decision?  These things look like the cautious patting and petting  of a spirited horse, preparatory to mounting him, when it is dreaded  that he may give the rider a fall.  And why the hasty after-indorsement  of the decision, by the President and others?  We cannot absolutely know  that all these exact adaptations are the result of pre-concert.  But  when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know  have been gotten out at different times and places and by different  workmen--Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James--[Douglas, Pierce, Taney  and Buchanan.]--for instance--and when we see these timbers joined  together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all  the tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths and  proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to"]]]
