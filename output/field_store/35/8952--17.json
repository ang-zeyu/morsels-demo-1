The air in the case is  saturated with moisture, so that evaporation cannot take place, but the  water is, nevertheless, drawn up from the roots and through the branches,  and appears as little drops on the margins of the leaves. That this is  owing to the absorbing power of the roots, may be shown by breaking off  the seedling, and putting the slip in water. No drops now appear on the  leaves, but as soon as the cutting has formed new roots, the drops again  appear.    [Footnote 1: See Lectures on the Physiology of Plants. By Sidney Howard  Vines, Cambridge, England. University Press, 1886. Page 92.]    This constant escape of water from the leaves causes a current to flow  from the roots through the stem into the cells of the leaves. The dilute  mineral solutions absorbed by the roots[1] are thus brought where they  are in contact with the external air, concentrated by the evaporation of  water, and converted in these cells into food materials, such as starch.  The presence of certain mineral matters, as potassium, iron, etc., are  necessary to this assimilating process, but the reason of their necessity  is imperfectly understood, as they do not enter in the products formed.    [Footnote 1: See page 48.]    The amount of water exhaled is often very great. Certain plants are used  for this reason for the drainage of wet and marshy places. The most  important of these is the Eucalyptus tree.[1]    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. XII. Transpiration.]    \"The amount of water taken from the soil by the trees of a forest and  passed into the air by transpiration is not so large as that accumulated  in the soil by the diminished evaporation under the branches. Hence, there  is an accumulation of water in the shade of forests which is released  slowly by drainage.[1] But if the trees are so scattered as not materially  to reduce evaporation from the ground, the effect of transpiration in  diminishing the moisture of the soil is readily shown. It is noted,  especially in case of large plants having a great extent of exhaling  surface, such, for instance, as the common sunflower. Among the plants  which have been successfully employed in the drainage of marshy soil by  transpiration probably the species of Eucalyptus (notably _E_. _globulus_)  are most efficient.\"[2]    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. XIII. Uses of the Forests.]    [Footnote 2: Physiological Botany, page 283.]      4. _Assimilation_.--It is not easy to find practical experiments on  assimilation. Those which follow are taken from \"Physiological Botany\" (p.  305).       Fill a five-inch test tube, provided with a foot, with fresh drinking     water. In this place a sprig of one of the following water     plants,--_Elodea Canadensis, Myriophyllum spicatum, M.     verticillatum_, or any leafy _Myriophyllum_ (in fact, any small-     leaved water plant with rather crowded foliage). This sprig should be     prepared as follows: Cut the stem squarely off, four inches or so     from the tip, dry the cut surface quickly with blotting paper, then     cover the end of the stein with a quickly drying varnish, for     instance, asphalt-varnish, and let it dry perfectly, keeping the rest     of the stem, if possible, moist by means of a wet cloth. When the     varnish is dry, puncture it with a needle, and immerse the stem in     the water in the test tube, keeping the varnished larger end     uppermost. If the submerged plant be now exposed to the strong rays     of the sun, bubbles of oxygen gas will begin to pass off at a rapid     and even rate, but not too fast to be easily counted. If the simple     apparatus has begun to give off a regular succession of small     bubbles, the following experiments can be at once conducted:       (1) Substitute for the fresh water some which has been boiled a few     minutes before, and then allowed to completely cool: by the boiling,     all the carbonic acid has been expelled. If the plant is immersed in     this water and exposed to the sun's rays, no bubbles will be evolved;     there is no carbonic acid within reach of the plant for the     assimilative process. But,       (2) If breath from the lungs be passed by means of a slender glass     tube through the water, a part of the carbonic acid exhaled from the     lungs will be dissolved in it, and with this supply of the gas the     plant begins the work of assimilation immediately.       (3) If the light be shut off, the evolution of bubbles will presently     cease, being resumed soon after light again has access to the plant.       (5) Place round the base of the test tube a few fragments of ice, in     order to appreciably lower the temperature of the water. At a certain     point it will be observed that no bubbles are given off, and their     evolution does not begin again until the water becomes warm.    The evolution of bubbles shows that the process of making food is going  on. The materials for this process are carbonic acid gas and water. The  carbonic acid dissolved in the surrounding water is absorbed, the carbon  unites with the elements of water in the cells of the leaves, forming  starch, etc., and most of the oxygen is set free, making the stream of  bubbles. When the water is boiled, the dissolved gas is driven off and  assimilation cannot go on; but as soon as more carbonic acid gas is  supplied, the process again begins. We have seen by these experiments  that sunlight and sufficient heat are necessary to assimilation, and that  carbonic acid gas and water must be present. The presence of the green  coloring matter of the leaves (chlorophyll) is also essential, and some  salts, such as potassium, iron, etc., are needful, though they may not  enter into the compounds formed.    The food products are stored in various parts of the plant for future use,  or are expended immediately in the growth and movements of the plant. In  order that they shall be used for growth, free oxygen is required, and  this is supplied by the respiration of the plant.    Some plants steal their food ready-made. Such a one is the Dodder, which  sends its roots directly into the plant on which it feeds. This is a  _parasite_.[1] It has no need of leaves to carry on the process of making  food. Some parasites with green leaves, like the mistletoe, take the crude  sap from the host-plant and assimilate it in their own green leaves.  Plants that are nourished by decaying matter in the soil are called  _saprophytes_. Indian Pipe and Beech-Drops are examples of this. They need  no green leaves as do plants that are obliged to support themselves.    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. XIV. Parasitic Plants.]    Some plants are so made that they can use animal matter for food. This  subject of insectivorous plants is always of great interest to pupils. If  some Sundew (_Drosera_) can be obtained and kept in the schoolroom, it  will supply material for many interesting experiments.[1] That plants  should possess the power of catching insects by specialized movements and  afterwards should digest them by means of a gastric juice like that of  animals, is one of the most interesting of the discoveries that have been  worked out during the last thirty years.[2]    [Footnote 1: See Insectivorous Plants, by Charles Darwin. New York: D.  Appleton and Co., 1875.    How Plants Behave, Chap. III.    A bibliography of the most important works on the subject will be found in  Physiological Botany, page 351, note.]    [Footnote 2: Reader in Botany. XV. Insectivorous Plants.]      5. _Respiration_.--Try the following experiment in germination.    Place some seeds on a sponge under an air-tight glass. Will they grow?  What causes them to mould?      Seeds will not germinate without free access of air. They must have free  oxygen to breathe, as must every living thing. We know that an animal  breathes in oxygen, that the oxygen unites with particles of carbon within  the body and that the resulting carbonic acid gas is exhaled.[1] The same  process goes on in plants, but it was until recently entirely unknown,  because it was completely masked during the daytime by the process of  assimilation, which causes carbonic acid to be inhaled and decomposed, and  oxygen to be exhaled.[2] In the night time the plants are not assimilating  and the process of breathing is not covered up. It has, therefore, long  been known that carbonic acid gas is given off at night. The amount,  however, is so small that it could not injure the air of the room, as  is popularly supposed. Respiration takes place principally through the  stomata of the leaves.[3] We often see plants killed by the wayside dust,  and we all know that on this account it is very difficult to make a hedge  grow well by a dusty road. The dust chokes up the breathing pores of the  leaves, interfering with the action of the plant. It is suffocated.    The oxygen absorbed decomposes starch, or some other food product of the  plant, and carbonic acid gas and water are formed. It is a process of slow  combustion.[4] The energy set free is expended in growth, that is, in the  formation of new cells, and the increase in size of the old ones, and in  the various movements of the plant.

For seven months the Prophet lodged in the house of Abu Ayub, and he  bought the yard where Al-Caswa halted as a token of his first entry into  Medina, and a remembrance in later years of his abiding place during the  difficult time of his inception. The decisive step had been taken. The  die was now cast. It was as if the little fleet of human souls had  finally cast its moorings and ventured into the unpathed waters of  temporal dominion under the command of one whose skill in pilotage was as  yet unknown. Many changes became necessary in the conduct of the  enterprise, of which not the least was the change of attitude between the  leader and his followers. Mahomet, heretofore religious visionary and  teacher, became the temporal head of a community, and in time the leader  of a political State. The changed aspect of his mission can never be  over-emphasised, for it altered the tenor of his thoughts and the  progress of his words. All the poetry and fire informing the early pages  of the Kuran departs with his reception at Medina, except for occasional  flashes that illumine the chronicle of detailed ordinances that the Book  has now become.    This apparent death of poetic energy had crept gradually over the Kuran,  helped on by the controversial character of the last two Meccan periods,  when he attempted the conciliation of the Jewish element within Arabia  with that long-sightedness which already discerned Medina as his possible  refuge. In reality the whole energy of his nature was transmuted from his  words to his actions and therein he found his fitting sphere, for he was  essentially the doer, one whose works are the expression of his secret,  whose personality, in fact, is only gauged by his deeds. As a result of  his political leadership, the despotism of his nature, inherent in his  conception of God, inevitably revealed itself; he had postulated a Being  who held mankind in the hollow of his hand, whose decrees were absolute  among his subjects; now that he was to found an earthly kingdom under the  guidance of Allah, the majesty of divine despotism overshadowed its  Prophet, and enabled him to impose upon a willing people the same  obedience to authority which fostered the military idea.    We must perforce believe in Mahomet's good faith. There is a tendency in  modern times to think of him as a man who knowingly played upon the  credulity of his followers to establish a sovereignty whereof he should  be head. But no student of psychology can support this conception of the  Prophet of Islam. There is a subtle _rapprochement_ between leader  and people in all great movements that divines instinctively any  imposture. Mahomet used and moulded men by reason of his faith in his own  creed. The establishment of the worship of Allah brought in its train the  aggrandisement of his Prophet, but it was not achieved by profanation of  the source whence his greatness came.    Mahomet is the last of those leaders who win both the religious  devotion and the political trust of his followers. He wrought out his  sovereignty perforce and created his own _milieu_; but more than all, he  diffused around him the tradition of loyalty to one God and one state  with sword for artificer, which outlived its creator through centuries of  Arabian prosperity. Stone by slow stone his empire was built up, an  edifice owing its contour to his complete grasp of detail and his  dauntless energy. The last days at Mecca had shown him a careful schemer,  the early days at Medina proved his capacity as leader and his skill in  organisation and government.          CHAPTER IX      THE CONSOLIDATION OF POWER      \"The Infidels, moreover, will say: Thou art not sent of God.    Say: God is witness enough betwixt me and you, and whoever hath    knowledge of the Book.\"--_The Kuran_.    Mahomet, now established at Medina, at once began that careful planning  of the lives of his followers and the ceaseless fostering of his own  ideas within them that endeared him to the Believers as leader and lord,  and enabled him in time to prosecute his designs against his opponents  with a confidence in their faith and loyalty.    His grasp of detail was wonderful; without haste and without coercion he  subdued the turbulent factions within Medina, and his own perfervid  followers to discipline as despotic as it was salutary; Mahomet became  what circumstances made him; by reason of his mighty gift of moulding  those men and forces that came his way, he impressed his personality upon  his age; but the material fashioning of his energy, the flower of his  creative art, drew its formative sustenance from the soil of his  surroundings. The time for admonition, with the voice of one crying in  the wilderness, the time for praise and poesy, for the expression of that  rapt immortal passion filling his mind as he contemplated God, all these  were past, and had become but a lingering brightness upon the stormy  urgency of his later life.    Now his flock demanded from him organisation, leadership, political and  social prevision. Therefore the full force of his nature is revealed to  us not so much as heretofore in the Kuran, but rather in his institutions  and ordinances, his enmities and conciliations. He has become not only  the Prophet, but the Lawgiver, the Statesman, almost the King.    His first act, after his establishment in the house of Abu Ayub, was the  joining together in brotherhood of the Muhajerim and Ansar. These were  two distinct entities within Medina; the Muhajerim (refugees) had either  accompanied their master from Mecca or had emigrated previously; the  Ansar (helpers) comprised all the converts to Islam within the city  itself. These parties were now joined in a close bond, each individual  taking another of the opposite party into brotherhood with himself, to be  accorded the rights and privileges of kinship. Mahomet took as his  brother Ali, who became indeed not only his kinsman, but his military  commander and chief of staff. The wisdom of this arrangement, which  lasted about a year and a half--until, in fact, its usefulness was  outworn by the union of both the Medinan tribes under his leadership  --was immediate and far-reaching. It enabled Mahomet to keep a close  surveillance over the Medinan converts, who might possibly recant when  they became aware of the hazards involved in partnership with the Muslim.  It also gave a coherence to the two parties and allowed the Muhajerim  some foothold in an alien city, not as yet unanimously friendly. And the  Muhajerim had need of all the kindliness and help they could obtain, for  the first six months in Medina were trying both to their health and  endurance, so that many repented their venture and would have returned if  the Ansar had not come forward with ministrations and gifts, and also if  their chances of reaching Mecca alive had not been so precarious.    The climate at Medina is damp and variable. Hot days alternate with cold  nights, and in winter there is almost continuous rain. The Meccans, used  to the dry, hot days and nights of their native city, where but little  rain fell, and even that became absorbed immediately in the parched  ground, endured much discomfort, even pain, before becoming acclimatised.  Fever broke out amongst them, and it was some months before the epidemic  was stayed with the primitive medical skill at their command.    Nevertheless, in spite of their weakness and the difficulties of their  position, in these first seven months the Mosque of Mahomet was built  Legend says that the Prophet himself took a share in the work, carrying  stones and tools with the humblest of his followers, and we can well  believe that he did not look on at the labour of his fellow-believers,  and that his consuming zeal prompted him to forward, in whatever way was  necessary, the work lying to his hand.    The Medinan Mosque, built with fervent hearts and anxious prayers by  the Muslim and their leader, contains the embryo of all the later  masterpieces of Arabian architecture--that art unique and splendid, which  developed with the Islamic spirit until it culminated in the glorious  temple at Delhi, whose exponents have given to the world the palaces of  southern Spain, the mysterious, remote beauty of ancient Granada. In its  embryo minarets and domes, its slender arches and delicate traceries, it  expressed the latent poetry in the heart of Islam which the claims of  Allah and the fiercely jealous worship of him had hitherto obscured; for  like Jahweh of old, Allah was an exacting spirit, who suffered no emotion  but worship to be lord of his people's hearts.    The Mosque was square in design, made of stone and brick, and wrought  with the best skill of which they were capable. The Kibla, or direction  of prayer, was towards Jerusalem, symbolic of Mahomet's desire to  propitiate the Jews, and finally to unite them with his own people in a  community with himself as temporal head. Opposite this was the Bab  Rahmah, the Gate of Mercy, and general entrance to the holy place. Ranged  round the outer wall of the Mosque were houses for the Prophet's wives  and daughters, little stone buildings, of two or three rooms, almost  huts, where Mahomet's household had its home--Rockeya, his daughter, and  Othman, her husband; Fatima and Ali, Sawda and Ayesha, soon to be his  girl-bride, and who even now showed exceeding loveliness and force of  character.    Mahomet himself had no separate house, but dwelt with each of his wives  in turn, favouring Ayesha most, and as his harem increased a house was  added for each wife, so that his entourage was continually near him and  under his surveillance. On the north side the ground was open, and there  the poorer followers of Mahomet gathered, living upon the never-failing  hospitality of the East and its ready generosity in the necessities of  life.    As soon as the Mosque was built, organised religious life at"]]]
