It so happened that we ourselves were present  at this dinner, which took place in 1842; and the painful circumstance  alluded to by Mr. Irving did not produce the effect on us, that it  appears to have produced on him. Without making a long story about  a trifle, we can call to mind no appearance of hostility or ill-will  manifested on that occasion; and on the contrary, recollect, in our  immediate neighborhood, a mournful sense of distress at the scene  exhibited, and sufficiently hinted in the few unpleasant words we  have italicized. A muster of Englishmen preferred coughing down their  favorite bard, to allowing him to mouth out maudlin twaddle, before  the Prince, then first formally introduced to the public, and before  a meeting whereat \"was collected much of the prominent talent of the  kingdom.\" Mr. Irving, himself most deservedly a man of mark, looked  on with much, surprise. Looking on ourselves then, and writing now,  as one of the public, and as one of the many to whom Campbell's name  and fame are inexpressibly dear, we honestly think that of two evils  the lesser was chosen. We think Mr. Hallam's lecture must have been  inaudible to the greater part of the company.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Archbishop of Lemburgh has prohibited his clergy from wearing long  hair like the peasants, and from smoking in public, \"like demagogues  and sons of Baal.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Persians have a saying, that \"Ten measures of talk were sent down  upon the earth, and the women took nine.\"           *       *       *       *       *          AUTHORS AND BOOKS           *       *       *       *       *    No man is more enshrined in the heart of the French people than the  poet BERANGER. A few weeks since he went one evening with one of his  nephews to the _Clos des Lilas_, a garden in the students' quarter  devoted to dancing in the open air, intending to look for a few  minutes upon a scene he had not visited since his youth, and then  withdraw. But he found it impossible to remain unknown and unobserved.  The announcement of his presence ran through the garden in a moment,  the dances stopped, the music ceased, and the crowd thronged toward  the point where the still genial and lovely old man was standing. At  once there rose from all lips the cry of _Vive Beranger!_ which was  quickly followed by that of _Vive la Republique!_ The poet whose  diffidence is excessive, could not answer a word, but only smiled and  blushed his thanks at this enthusiastic reception. The acclamations  continuing, an agent of the police invited him to withdraw, lest his  presence might occasion disorder. The illustrious songwriter at once  obeyed; by a singular coincidence the door through which he went out  opened upon the place where Marshal Ney was shot. If he were now in  the vein of writing, what a stirring lyric all these circumstances  might suggest.           *       *       *       *       *    AUDUBON AND WASHINGTON IRVING--THE PLAGUE OF RAILROADS.--The voyager  up the Hudson will involuntarily anathematize the invention of the  rail, when he sees how much of the most romantic beauty has been  defaced or destroyed by that tyranny which, disregarding all private  desire and justice, has filled up bays, and cut off promontories, and  leveled heights, to make way for the intrusive and noisy car. But the  effects of these so-called \"improvements,\" upon the romantic in nature  will be forgotten if he considers the injury and wrong they cause to  persons, and particularly to those whose genius has contributed more  to human happiness than all the inventions in oeconomical art.    The Nestor of our naturalists, and in his field, the greatest as well  as the oldest of our artists, AUDUBON, with the comparatively slight  gains of a long life of devotion to science, and of triumphs which had  made him world-renowned, purchased on the banks of the river, not far  from the city, a little estate which it was the joy as well as the  care of his closing years to adorn with everything that a taste so  peculiarly and variously schooled could suggest. He had made it a  pleasing gate-way to the unknown world, with beautiful walks leading  down to the river whose depth and calmness and solemn grandeur  symboled the waves through which he should pass to the reward of a  life of such toil and enviable glory. He had promise of an evening  worthy of his meridian--when the surveyors and engineers, with their  charter-privileges, invaded his retreat, built a road through his  garden, destroyed forever his repose, and--the melancholy truth is  known--made of his mind a ruin.    WASHINGTON IRVING--now sixty-seven years of age--had found a  resting-place at _Wolfert's Roost_, close by the scenes which lie in  the immortal beauty that radiates from his pages, and when he thought  that in this Tusculum he was safe from all annoying, free to enjoy  the quietness and ease he had earned from the world, the same vandals  laid the track through his grounds, not only destroying all their  beauty and attraction, but leaving fens from which these summer heats  distilled contagion. He has therefore been ill for some weeks, and  as he had never a strong constitution, and has preserved his equable  but not vigorous health only by the most constant carefulness, his  physicians and friends begin to be alarmed for the result. Heaven  avert the end they so fearfully anticipate. He cannot go alone: The  honest Knickerbocker, the gentle Crayon, and the faithful brother  Agapida, with Washington Irving will forever leave the world, which  cannot yet resign itself to the loss of either.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. SEBA SMITH, so well known as the author of the \"Letters of Major  Jack Downing,\" and to a different sort of readers for his more serious  contributions to our literature, has just completed the printing of  an original and very remarkable work, upon which he has been engaged  about two years, entitled \"New Elements of Geometry,\" and it will soon  be published in this city by Putnam, and in London by Bentley. It will  probably produce a sensation in the world of science. Its design is  the reconstruction of the entire methods of Geometry. All geometers,  from the dawn of the science, have built their systems upon these  definitions: _A line is length without breadth_, and _A surface is  length and breadth, without thickness_. Mr. Smith asserts that  these definitions are false, and sustains his position by numerous  demonstrations in the pure Euclidean style. He declares that every  mathematical line has a definite _breadth_, which is as measurable as  its length, and that every mathematical surface has a _thickness_,  as measurable as the contents of any solid. His demonstrations, on  diagrams, seem to be eminently clear, simple, and conclusive. The  effects of this discovery and these demonstrations are, to simplify  very much the whole subject of Geometry and mathematics, and to clear  it of many obscurities and difficulties. All geometers heretofore  have claimed that there are _three kinds_ of quantity in Geometry,  different in their _natures_, and requiring units of different natures  to measure them. Mr. Smith shows that there is but _one_ kind of  quantity in Geometry, and but one kind of unit; and that lines,  surfaces, and solids are always measured by the same identical unit.    Besides the leading features of the work which we have thus briefly  described, it contains many new and beautiful demonstrations of  general principles in Geometry, to which the author was lead by his  new methods of investigation. Among these we may mention one, viz.,  \"The square of the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle equals four  times the area of the triangle, plus the square of the difference of  the other two sides.\" This principle has been known to mathematicians  by means of arithmetic and algebra, but has never before, we believe,  been reduced to a geometrical demonstration. The demonstration of  this principle by Mr. Smith is one of the clearest, simplest, and  most beautiful in Geometry. The work is divided into three parts,  I. The Philosophy of Geometry, II. Demonstrations in Geometry, and  III. Harmonies of Geometry. The demonstrative character of it is  occasionally enlivened by philosophical and historical observations,  which will add much to its interest with the general reader. We have  too little skill in studies of this sort to be altogether confident  in our opinion, but certainly it strikes us from an examination of the  larger and more important portion of Mr. Smith's essay, that it is an  admirable specimen of statement and demonstration, and that it must  secure to its author immediately a very high rank in mathematical  science. We shall await with much interest the judgments of the  professors. It makes a handsome octavo of some 200 pages.           *       *       *       *       *    M. FLANDIN, an eminent dilettante and designer attached to the French  embassy in Persia, has published in the last number of the _Revue des  Deux Mondes_ an interesting memoir of the ruins of Persepolis, under  the title of \"An Archaiological Journey in Persia.\" On his route  to the ruins he witnessed melancholy evidence, in the condition of  the surface and population, of the improvidence and noxiousness of  Oriental despotism. He tells us that the remains of the magnificent  palace of Darius are dispersed over an immense _plateau_, which looks  down on the plain of Merdacht. \"Assuredly, they are not much, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13797"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#5)"],[1,"dolmanys; those who could save themselves fled.

BY ELIZABETH OAKES SMITH.    \"Quorum pars magna fui.\"      Oh! loveliest of the stars of Heaven,      Thus did ye walk the crystal dome,    When to the earth a child was given,      Within a love-lit, northern home;    Thus leading up the starry train,      With aspect still benign,    Ye move in your fair orbs again      As on that birth long syne.      Within her curtained room apart,      The pale young mother faintly smiled;    While warmly to a father's heart      With love and prayer was pressed the child;    And, softly to the lattice led,      In whispers grandams show    How those presaging stars have shed      Around the child a glow.      Born in the glowing summer prime,      With planets thus conjoined in space    As if they watched the natal time,      And came to bless the infant face;    Oh! there was gladness in that bower,      And beauty in the sky;    And Hope and Love foretold a dower      Of brightest destiny.      Unconscious child! that smiling lay      Where love's fond eyes, and bright stars gleamed,    How long and toilsome grew the way      O'er which those brilliant orbs had beamed;    How oft the faltering step drew back      In terror of the path,    When giddy steep, and wildering track      Seemed fraught with only wrath!      How oft recoiled the woman foot,      With tears that shamed the path she trod.    To find a canker at the root      Of every hope, save that in God!    And long, oh! long, and weary long,      Ere she had learned to feel    That Love, unselfish, deep, and strong,      Repays its own wild zeal.      Bright Hesperus! who on the eyes      Of Milton poured thy brightest ray!    Effulgent dweller of the skies,      Take not from me thy light away--    I look on thee, and I recall      The dreams of by-gone years--    O'er many a hope I lay the pall      With its becoming tears;      Yet turn to thee with thy full beam,      And bless thee, Oh love-giving star!    For life's sweet, sad, illusive dream      Fruition, though in Heaven afar--    \"A silver lining\" hath the cloud      Through dark and stormiest night,    And there are eyes to pierce the shroud      And see the hidden light.      Thou movest side by side with Jove,      And, 'tis a quaint conceit, perchance--    Thou seem'st in humid light to move      As tears concealed thy burning glance--    Such Virgil saw thee, when thine eyes,      More lovely through their glow,[2]    Won from the Thunderer of the skies      An accent soft and low.      And Mars is there with his red beams,      Tumultuous, earnest, unsubdued--    And silver-footed Dian gleams      Faint as when she, on Latmos stood--    God help the child! such night brought forth      When Love to Power appeals,    And strong-willed Mars at frozen north      Beside Diana steals.

How oft the burdened heart would sink      In fathomless despair    But for an angel on the brink--      In mercy standing there:    An angel bright with heavenly light--      And born of loftiest skies,    Who shows her face to mortal race,      In Friendship's holy guise.      Upon the brink of dark despair,      With smiling face she stands;    And to the victim shrinking there,      Outspreads her eager hands:    In accents low that sweetly flow      To his awakening ear,    She woos him back--his deathward track.      Toward Hope's effulgent sphere.      Sweet Friendship! let me daily give      Thanks to my God for thee!    Without thy smiles t'were death to live,      And joy to cease to be:    Oh, bitterest drop in woe's full cup--      To have no friend in need!    To struggle on, with grief alone--      Were agony indeed!    August. WILLIAM C. RICHARDS.           *       *       *       *       *    THE BALANCE OF LIFE.      All daring sympathy--clear-sighted love--      Is, from its source, a ray of endless bliss;    Self has no place in the pure world above,      Its shadows vanish in the strife of this.      The toil--the tumult--the sharp struggle o'er,--      The casket breaks;--men say, \"A martyr dies!\"    The death--the martyrdom--has past before:      The soul, transfigured, finds its native skies.      The good--the ill--we vainly strive to weigh      With Reason's scales, hung in the mists of Time:    Yet child-like Faith the balance doth survey,      Held high in ether, by a hand sublime.

Gonon. Dispatches  in French, English, Portuguese, Russian, and Latin, including proper  names of men and places, and also figures, were transmitted and  translated, says this account, with a rapidity and fidelity alike  marvelous, by an officer who knew nothing of any one of the languages  used except his own. Dots, commas, accents, and breaks were all in  their places. This dictionary of M. Gonon is applicable alike to  electric and aerial telegraphy, to transmissions by night and by day,  to maritime and to military telegraphing. The same paper speaks of  the great interest excited in the European capitals by the approaching  experiment of submarine telegraphic communication between England  and France. The wires, it says, on the English side are deposited  and ready for laying down. It is probable that in a very few days the  experiment will be complete.           *       *       *       *       *          AUTHORS AND BOOKS.           *       *       *       *       *    NEW ORLEANS AS SEEN BY A GERMAN PRINCE is very naturally not quite  the same city as in the opinion of her own pleasure-loving citizens,  nor can the republic whose South-western metropolis is condemned with  the rigidity of a merciless judge and the jaundice of an unfriendly  traveler, hope to get clear of censure from the same super-royal pen.  It seems that his serenest highness Major-General Duke Paul William,  of Wirtemburg, is traveling in America, and that the _Ausland_, a  weekly paper, of Stuttgart, is from time to time favored with the  results of his experience on the way. From some recent portions of his  correspondence _The International_ translates the subjoined _morceau_,  which, however, despite its great exaggeration, is not altogether  devoid of truth: \"It is not necessary here to mention how much  New Orleans has altered, increased, and deteriorated, for it is an  established thing that cities which grow to such gigantic proportions  gain nothing in respect to the morals of their inhabitants. Here  drunkenness and gambling, two vices of which the Americans were  ignorant in the time of the founders of their great federation,  have taken very deep root. The decrease of the inflexible spirit of  religion, and the increase of vice and luxury, gnaw the powerful tree,  and are fearful enemies, which cannot be resisted by a structure that  might resist with scorn all foreign foes, and would have played a  mighty part in the world's history had the spirit of Washington and  Franklin remained with it. The annexation of Texas, the war with  Mexico, and now the gold of California, have transformed the United  States. A people which makes conquests, loses inward power in  proportion to the aggrandizement of its volume, and the increase of  its external enemies.\"           *       *       *       *       *    AN ARABIAN NEWSPAPER, with the title _Mobacher_. has lately been  commenced in Algiers, at the expense of the French Government. It  is edited in the cabinet of the Governor-General, issued weekly, and  lithographed, as less expensive than printing, which in Arabic types  would be quite costly. It contains political news from Europe and  Africa, the latest advices from Constantinople, all those laws and  decrees of the Government which in any way concern the Arabs, and  descriptions of such new discoveries and inventions as can be made  intelligible to the readers for whom it is designed. A thousand copies  are printed weekly and sent to the chiefs and headmen of all the  tribes that are under French rule or influence. At first it was not  read much, but now the vanity of the Arabs has been excited by it as a  mark of special attention from the Governor-General, so that they take  it as an honor, and a degree of curiosity has been excited to obtain  news from other parts of the world.    Within a short time, also, an additional importance has been given to  the paper by the publication in it of the amount of the tribute which  each tribe is required to pay to France. Formerly this was known only  to the chiefs who would accordingly exact from their people whatever  amount they deemed best, under the pretense that it was for the  government, while the greater part was"]]]
