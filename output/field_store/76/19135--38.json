[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#5)"],[1,"coming of Dr. Fu-Manchu to  London, that awakened fears long dormant and reopened old wounds--nay,  poured poison into them. I strove desperately, by close attention to  my professional duties, to banish the very memory of Karamaneh from my  mind; desperately, but how vainly! Peace was for me no more, joy was  gone from the world, and only mockery remained as my portion.    Poor Eltham we had placed in a nursing establishment, where his  indescribable hurts could be properly tended: and his uncomplaining  fortitude not infrequently made me thoroughly ashamed of myself.  Needless to say, Smith had made such other arrangements as were  necessary to safeguard the injured man, and these proved so successful  that the malignant being whose plans they thwarted abandoned his designs  upon the heroic clergyman and directed his attention elsewhere, as I  must now proceed to relate.    Dusk always brought with it a cloud of apprehensions, for darkness must  ever be the ally of crime; and it was one night, long after the clocks  had struck the mystic hour \"when churchyards yawn,\" that the hand of  Dr. Fu-Manchu again stretched out to grasp a victim. I was dismissing a  chance patient.    \"Good night, Dr. Petrie,\" he said.    \"Good night, Mr. Forsyth,\" I replied; and, having conducted my late  visitor to the door, I closed and bolted it, switched off the light and  went upstairs.    My patient was chief officer of one of the P. and O. boats. He had cut  his hand rather badly on the homeward run, and signs of poisoning  having developed, had called to have the wound treated, apologizing for  troubling me at so late an hour, but explaining that he had only just  come from the docks. The hall clock announced the hour of one as I  ascended the stairs. I found myself wondering what there was in Mr.  Forsyth's appearance which excited some vague and elusive memory. Coming  to the top floor, I opened the door of a front bedroom and was surprised  to find the interior in darkness.    \"Smith!\" I called.    \"Come here and watch!\" was the terse response. Nayland Smith was sitting  in the dark at the open window and peering out across the common. Even  as I saw him, a dim silhouette, I could detect that tensity in his  attitude which told of high-strung nerves.    I joined him.    \"What is it?\" I said, curiously.    \"I don't know. Watch that clump of elms.\"    His masterful voice had the dry tone in it betokening excitement. I  leaned on the ledge beside him and looked out. The blaze of stars almost  compensated for the absence of the moon and the night had a quality of  stillness that made for awe. This was a tropical summer, and the common,  with its dancing lights dotted irregularly about it, had an unfamiliar  look to-night. The clump of nine elms showed as a dense and irregular  mass, lacking detail.    Such moods as that which now claimed my friend are magnetic. I had no  thought of the night's beauty, for it only served to remind me that  somewhere amid London's millions was lurking an uncanny being, whose  life was a mystery, whose very existence was a scientific miracle.    \"Where's your patient?\" rapped Smith.    His abrupt query diverted my thoughts into a new channel. No footstep  disturbed the silence of the highroad; where was my patient?    I craned from the window. Smith grabbed my arm.    \"Don't lean out,\" he said.    I drew back, glancing at him surprisedly.    \"For Heaven's sake, why not?\"    \"I'll tell you presently, Petrie. Did you see him?\"    \"I did, and I can't make out what he is doing. He seems to have remained  standing at the gate for some reason.\"    \"He has seen it!\" snapped Smith. \"Watch those elms.\"    His hand remained upon my arm, gripping it nervously. Shall I say that  I was surprised? I can say it with truth. But I shall add that I was  thrilled, eerily; for this subdued excitement and alert watching of  Smith could only mean one thing:    Fu-Manchu!    And that was enough to set me watching as keenly as he; to set me  listening; not only for sounds outside the house but for sounds within.  Doubts, suspicions, dreads, heaped themselves up in my mind. Why was  Forsyth standing there at the gate? I had never seen him before, to  my knowledge, yet there was something oddly reminiscent about the man.  Could it be that his visit formed part of a plot? Yet his wound had been  genuine enough. Thus my mind worked, feverishly; such was the effect of  an unspoken thought--Fu-Manchu.    Nayland Smith's grip tightened on my arm.    \"There it is again, Petrie!\" he whispered.    \"Look, look!\"    His words were wholly unnecessary. I, too, had seen it; a wonderful and  uncanny sight. Out of the darkness under the elms, low down upon the  ground, grew a vaporous blue light. It flared up, elfinish, then  began to ascend. Like an igneous phantom, a witch flame, it rose,  high--higher--higher, to what I adjudged to be some twelve feet or more  from the ground. Then, high in the air, it died away again as it had  come!    \"For God's sake, Smith, what was it?\"    \"Don't ask me, Petrie. I have seen it twice. We--\"    He paused. Rapid footsteps sounded below. Over Smith's shoulder I saw  Forsyth cross the road, climb the low rail, and set out across the  common.    Smith sprang impetuously to his feet.    \"We must stop him!\" he said hoarsely; then, clapping a hand to my mouth  as I was about to call out--\"Not a sound, Petrie!\"    He ran out of the room and went blundering downstairs in the dark,  crying:    \"Out through the garden--the side entrance!\"    I overtook him as he threw wide the door of my dispensing room. Through  it he ran and opened the door at the other end. I followed him  out, closing it behind me. The smell from some tobacco plants in a  neighboring flower-bed was faintly perceptible; no breeze stirred; and  in the great silence I could hear Smith, in front of me, tugging at the  bolt of the gate.    Then he had it open, and I stepped out, close on his heels, and left the  door ajar.    \"We must not appear to have come from your house,\" explained Smith  rapidly. \"I will go along the highroad and cross to the common a hundred  yards up, where there is a pathway, as though homeward bound to the  north side. Give me half a minute's start, then you proceed in an  opposite direction and cross from the corner of the next road. Directly  you are out of the light of the street lamps, get over the rails and run  for the elms!\"    He thrust a pistol into my hand and was off.    While he had been with me, speaking in that incisive, impetuous way of  his, with his dark face close to mine, and his eyes gleaming like steel,  I had been at one with him in his feverish mood, but now, when I stood  alone, in that staid and respectable byway, holding a loaded pistol in  my hand, the whole thing became utterly unreal.    It was in an odd frame of mind that I walked to the next corner, as  directed; for I was thinking, not of Dr. Fu-Manchu, the great and evil  man who dreamed of Europe and America under Chinese rule, not of Nayland  Smith, who alone stood between the Chinaman and the realization of his  monstrous schemes, not even of Karamaneh the slave girl, whose glorious  beauty was a weapon of might in Fu-Manchu's hand, but of what impression  I must have made upon a patient had I encountered one then.    Such were my ideas up to the moment that I crossed to the common and  vaulted into the field on my right. As I began to run toward the elms I  found myself wondering what it was all about, and for what we were  come. Fifty yards west of the trees it occurred to me that if Smith had  counted on cutting Forsyth off we were too late, for it appeared to me  that he must already be in the coppice.    I was right. Twenty paces more I ran, and ahead of me, from the elms,  came a sound. Clearly it came through the still air--the eerie hoot of a  nighthawk. I could not recall ever to have heard the cry of that bird on  the common before, but oddly enough I attached little significance to it  until, in the ensuing instant, a most dreadful scream--a scream in which  fear, and loathing, and anger were hideously blended--thrilled me with  horror.    After that I have no recollection of anything until I found myself  standing by the southernmost elm.    \"Smith!\" I cried breathlessly. \"Smith! my God! where are you?\"    As if in answer to my cry came an indescribable sound, a mingled sobbing  and choking. Out from the shadows staggered a ghastly figure--that of a  man whose face appeared to be streaked. His eyes glared at me madly and  he mowed the air with his hands like one blind and insane with fear.    I started back; words died upon my tongue. The figure reeled and the man  fell babbling and sobbing at my very feet.    Inert I stood, looking down at him. He writhed a moment--and was still.  The silence again became perfect. Then, from somewhere beyond the elms,  Nayland Smith appeared. I did not move. Even when he stood beside me, I  merely stared at him fatuously.    \"I let him walk to his death, Petrie,\" I heard dimly. \"God forgive  me--God forgive me!\"    The words aroused me.    \"Smith\"--my voice came as a whisper--\"for one awful moment I thought--\"    \"So did some one else,\" he rapped. \"Our poor sailor has met the end  designed for me, Petrie!\"    At that I realized two things: I knew why Forsyth's face had struck me  as being familiar in some puzzling way, and I knew why Forsyth now  lay dead upon the grass. Save that he was a fair man and wore a slight  mustache, he was, in features and build, the double of Nayland Smith!        CHAPTER V. THE NET    We raised the poor victim and turned him over on his back. I dropped  upon my knees, and with unsteady fingers began to strike a match. A  slight breeze was arising and sighing gently through the elms, but,  screened by my hands, the flame of the match took life. It illuminated  wanly the sun-baked face of Nayland Smith, his eyes gleaming with  unnatural brightness.

When a sufficient quantity of the  roots is collected, they are taken to a running stream, or to the  sea-beach, and washed; the outer skin is carefully scraped off at the  same time with a shell; and those who are particular in the  preparation scrape out even the eyes. The root is then reduced to a  pulp, by rubbing it up and down a kind of rasp, made as follows:--A  piece of board, about 3 in. wide, and 12 ft. long, is procured, upon  which some coarse twine, made of the fibres of the cocoa nut husk, is  tightly and regularly wound, and which affords an admirable substitute  for a coarse rasp. The pulp, when prepared, is washed first with salt  or sea water, through a sieve made of the fibrous web which protects  the young frond of the cocoa-nut palm; and the starch, or arrow-root,  being carried through with the water, is received in a wooden trough  made like the small canoes used by the natives. The starch is allowed  to settle for a few days; the water is then strained, or, more  properly, poured off, and the sediment rewashed with fresh (or river)  water. This washing is repeated three times with spring water; after  which the deposit is made into balls of about 7 or 8 in. in diameter,  and in this state dried in the sun for twelve or twenty-four hours.  The balls are then broken, and the powder spread for some days in the  sun to dry; after which it is carefully wrapped in _tapa_ (the native  cloth), and put into baskets, and hung up in the houses. The natural  indolence of the people is so great, and their avarice such, that but  few of them will give the arrow-root sufficient time to dry, if they  have an opportunity of parting with it, which I suspect was the case  with that sent to England some few years back by the missionaries. So  abundant is the root, that several tons might be prepared annually by  proper management: as it is, there is a considerable quantity  prepared; it being not only eaten by the natives and strangers on the  island, but also by the crews of the vessels that touch there.    At present, when the roots are taken up, the only precaution used to  secure a crop the following year is to throw the smaller roots back  into the holes from which they were taken, and to leave them to  chance. I have no doubt that, with proper care and cultivation, any  quantity might be produced. When we visited the island, we purchased  the prepared arrow-root at _2d._ per lb., and a missionary there  informed us, that he would engage to procure any given quantity at  _1-1/2d._ per lb., which is, I believe, much less than it can be  purchased at either in the East or the West Indies. Its quality is  excellent; I should say equal to that of the East Indies, and far  superior to that of Chile, with which I have since my return, had an  opportunity of comparing it.           *       *       *       *       *        NOTES OF A READER.           *       *       *       *       *      JULIET'S TOMB.        \"In fair Verona, where we lay our scene.\"    The traditionary story of _Romeo and Juliet_ is fact. The animosities  of the houses of Montagu and the Capulet are matter of the history of  Verona, where, in olden times, Pliny and Catullus were born. Juliet  was buried in the _soutterain_ of Fermo Maggiore, which belonged to an  order of Franciscan friars, and was founded in 1230. Some years ago  the monastery was burnt down, and the vaults and burying-place reduced  to ruins. At this time the stone sarcophagus, the sepulchre of Juliet,  was removed, and placed where it now is, in the entrance gateway of  the monastery. The upper edge of it was entire when it was first put  here, but has since been mutilated, as is represented in the Cut, for  scraps to carry away as relics. Thus noted Mr. Duppa, a few years  since; but we have other pilgrims and fair pens to establish the  identity.    [Illustration: (_Juliet's Tomb._)]    Lord Byron, in a postscript to one of his letters from Verona, dated  Nov. 7, 1816, says, \"I have been over Verona. Of the truth of Juliet's  story, they seem tenacious to a degree, insisting on the fact--giving  a date (1303), and showing a tomb. It is a plain, open, and partly  decayed sarcophagus, with withered leaves in it, in a wild and  desolate conventual garden--once a cemetery, now ruined to the very  graves. The situation struck me as very appropriate to the legend,  being blighted as their love. I have brought away a few pieces of the  granite, to give to my daughter and my nieces.\"[5]        [5] Moore's Life of Byron, vol. ii. 4to. p. 50.    Mrs. Maria Callcott writes, in 1829:--\"The tomb now shown as that of  Juliet, is an ancient sarcophagus of red granite: it has suffered from  the fire which burnt down the church, where it was originally  placed.\"[6]        [6] See a sketch accompanying an Engraving of Verona, in vol.          xiv. of the _Mirror_, p. 321.    Lastly, the accomplished authoress of _Characteristics of Women_ adds  her testimony, and illustrates the fondness with which the relics of  Juliet are cherished, by noting that she met in Italy a gentleman, who  being then \"_dans le genre romantique_,\" wore a fragment of Juliet's  tomb set in a ring.[7]        [7] See p. 118 of the present volume.           *       *       *       *       *      MONASTERIES.      It is a strange error to conceive that English monasteries, before the  dissolution, fed the indigent part of the nation, and gave that  general relief which the poor laws are intended to afford.    _Hallam._           *       *       *       *       *      PIRACY.      Mr. Hallam makes the following excellent observations upon the  frequency of piracy in the middle ages:--\"A pirate, in a well-armed,  quick-sailing vessel, must feel, I suppose, the enjoyments of his  exemption from control more exquisitely than any other free-booter;  and, darting along the bosom of the ocean, under the impartial  radiance of the heavens, may deride the dark concealments and hurried  nights of the forest robber. His occupation is indeed extinguished by  the civilization of later ages, or confined to distant climates. But  in the 13th or 14th centuries, a rich vessel was never secure from  attack; and neither restitution nor punishment of the criminals was to  be obtained from governments, who sometimes feared the plunderer, and  sometimes connived at the offence.\"           *       *       *       *       *      GOOD EFFECTS OF SALT.      Salt appears to be a necessary and universal stimulus to animated  beings; and its effects upon the vegetable as well as animal kingdom  have furnished objects of the most interesting inquiry to the  physiologist, the chemist, the physician, and the agriculturist. It  appears to be a natural stimulant to the digestive organs of all  warm-blooded animals, and that they are instinctively led to immense  distances in pursuit of it. This is strikingly exemplified in the  avidity with which animals in a wild state seek the salt-pans of  Africa and America, and in the difficulties they will encounter to  reach them: this cannot arise from accident or caprice, but from a  powerful instinct, which, beyond control, compels them to seek, at all  risks, that which is salubrious. To those who are anxious to gain  further information upon this curious subject, I would recommend the  perusal of a work entitled \"_Thoughts on the Laws relating to Salt_,\"  by Samuel Parkes, Esq., and a small volume by my late lamented friend  Sir Thomas Bernard, on the \"_Case of the Salt Duties, with Proofs and  Illustrations_.\" We are all sensible of the effect of salt on the  human body; we know how unpalatable fresh meat and vegetables are  without it. During the course of my professional practice, I have had  frequent opportunities of witnessing the evils which have attended an  abstinance from salt. In my examination before a committee of the  House of Commons in 1818, appointed for the purpose of inquiring into  the laws respecting the salt duties, I stated, from my own experience,  the bad effects of a diet of unsalted fish, and the injury which the  poorer classes, in many districts, sustained in their health from an  inability to procure this essential condiment. I had some years ago a  gentleman of rank and fortune under my care, for a deranged state of  the digestive organs, accompanied with extreme emaciation. I found  that, from some cause which he could not explain, he had never eaten  any salt with his meals: I enforced the necessity of his taking it in  moderate quantities, and the recovery of his digestive powers was soon  evinced in the increase of his strength and condition. One of the ill  effects produced by an unsalted diet is the generation of worms. Mr.  Marshall has published the case of a lady who had a natural antipathy  to salt, and was in consequence most dreadfully infested with worms  during the whole of her life.--(_London Medical and Physical Journal_,  vol. xxix. No. 231.) In Ireland, where, from the bad quality of the  food, the lower classes are greatly infested with worms, a draught of  salt and water is a popular and efficacious anthelmintic. Lord  Somerville, in his Address to the Board of Agriculture, gave an  interesting account of the effects of a punishment which formerly  existed in Holland. \"The ancient laws of the country ordained men to  be kept on bread alone, unmixed with salt, as the severest punishment  that could be inflicted upon them in their moist climate. The effect  was horrible; these wretched criminals are said to have been devoured  by worms engendered in their own stomachs.\" The wholesomeness and  digestibility of our bread are undoubtedly much promoted by the  addition of salt which it so universally receives.    _Dr. Paris--quoted in the Doctor._           *       *       *       *       *      PROGRESS OF THE SCIENCES.
