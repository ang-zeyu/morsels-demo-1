Tallien chose  the attire of the Roman patrician lady; and the gold-embroidered purple  robes, and the golden tiara in her black, shining hair, gave to the  charming and beautiful daughter of the republic the magnificence of an  empress. She had also drawn around her a splendid court. All eagerly  pressed forward to pay their respects to and obtain the good will of the  mighty wife of the mighty Tallien. Her house was the great point of  attraction to all those who occupied prominent positions in Paris, or  aspired to such. While in the parlors of Madame Recamier, who, despite  the revolution, had remained a zealous royalist, the past and the good  time of the Bourbons were whispered of, and witty and often sanguinary  _bon mots_ at the expense of the republic uttered--while in Madame de  Stael's parlors art and science had found an asylum--Madame Tallien and  court lived for the present, and basked in the splendor with which she  knew how to invest the palace of the dictators of France.    In the mean while, Viscountess Josephine Beauharnais had been living,  with her children, in quiet retirement, a prey to sad memories. A day  came, however, when she was compelled to tear herself from this last  consolation of the unhappy, the brooding over the sorrows and losses of  the past, or see her children become the victims of misery and want. The  time had come when she must leave her retirement, and step, as a  petitioner, before those who had the power to grant, as a favor, that  which was hers by right, and restore to her, at least in part, her  sequestered estate. Josephine had known Madame Tallien when she was  still Madame de Fontenay, and it now occurred to her that she might  assist her in her attempt to recover the inheritance of her father.  Madame Tallien, the \"Merveilleuse de Luxembourg,\" also called by her  admirers, \"Notre-dame de Thermidor,\" felt much nattered at being called  on by a real viscountess, who had filled a distinguished position at the  court of King Louis. She therefore received her with great amiability,  and endeavored to make the charming and beautiful viscountess her  friend. But Josephine found that estates were more easily lost than  recovered. The republic, one and indivisible, was always ready to take,  but not to give; and, even with the kindly offices of Madame Tallien  freely exerted in her behalf, it was some time before Josephine  succeeded in recovering her estate. In the mean time, she really  suffered want, and she and her children were compelled to bear the  hardships and mortifications which poverty brings in its train. But true  friends still remained to her in her misery; friends who, with true  delicacy, furnished her with the prime necessities of life--with food  and clothing for herself and children. In general, it was characteristic  of this period that no one felt humiliated by accepting benefits of this  kind from his friends. Those who had lost all had not done so through  their own fault; and those who had saved their property out of the  general wreck could not attribute their fortune to their own merit or  wisdom, but merely to chance. They therefore considered it a sacred  duty to divide with those who had been less fortunate; and the latter  would point with pride to the poverty which proved that they had been  true to themselves and principle, and accept what friendship offered.  This was the result of a kind of community of property, to which the  revolution had given birth. Those who had possessions considered it  their duty to divide with those who had not, and the latter regarded  this division rather as a right than as a benefit conferred.    Josephine could, therefore, accept the assistance of her friends without  blushing; she could, with propriety, allow Madame de Montmorin to  provide for the wardrobe of herself and daughter; and she and Hortense  could accept the invitation of Madame Dumoulin to dine with her twice a  week. There, at Madame Dumoulin's, were assembled, on certain days, a  number of friends, who had been robbed of their fortunes by the storms  of the revolution. Madame Dumoulin, the wife of a rich army-contractor,  gave these dinners to her friends, but each guest was expected to bring  with him his own white-bread. White-bread was, at that time, considered  one of the greatest dainties; for, there being a scarcity of grain, a  law had been proclaimed allotting to each section of Paris a certain  amount of bread, and providing that no individual should be entitled to  purchase more than two ounces daily. It had, therefore, become the  general custom to add the following to all invitations: \"You are  requested to bring your white bread with you,\" for the reason that no  more than the allotted two ounces could be had for money, and that  amount cost the purchaser dearly[2]. Josephine, however, had not even  the money to buy the portion allowed her by law. An exception to this  rule was, however, made in favor of Josephine and Hortense; and at  Madame Dumoulin's dinners the hostess always provided white bread for  them, and for them alone of all her guests. Viscountess Beauharnais was  soon, however, to be freed from this want. One day when she had been  invited by Madame Tallien to dinner, and had walked to the palace with  Hortense, Tallien informed her that the government had favorably  considered her petition, and was willing to make some concessions to the  widow of a true patriot who had sealed his devotion to principle with  his blood; that he had procured an ordinance from the administration of  domains, pursuant to which the seals were at once to be removed from her  furniture and other personal property, and that the republic had  remitted to her, through him, an order on the treasury for her relief,  until the sequestration of her landed estates should be annulled, which  he expected would soon take place.    [Footnote 2: Memoires de Monsieur de Bourrienne sur Napoleon, etc., Vol.  i., p. 80.]    Josephine found no words in which to express her thanks. She pressed her  daughter to her heart and cried out, her face bathed in tears: \"We shall  at last be happy! My children shall no longer suffer want!\" This time  the tears Josephine shed were tears of joy, the first in long years.    Care and want were now over. Josephine could now give her children an  education suitable to their rank; she could now once more assume the  position in society to which her beauty, youth, amiability, and name  entitled her. She no longer came to Madame Tallien's parlor as a  suppliant, she was now its ornament, and all were eager to do homage to  the adored friend of Madame Tallien, to the beautiful and charming  viscountess. But Josephine preferred the quiet bliss of home-life in the  circle of her children to the brilliant life of society; she gradually  withdrew from the noisy circles of the outer world, in order that she  might, in peaceful retirement, devote herself to the cultivation of the  hearts and minds of her promising children.    Eugene was now a youth of sixteen years, and, as his personal security  no longer required him to deny his name and rank, he had left his  master's carpenter-shop, and laid aside his blouse. He was preparing  himself for military service under the instruction of excellent  teachers, whom he astonished by his zeal and rare powers of  comprehension. The military renown and heroic deeds of France filled him  with enthusiasm; and one day, while speaking with his teacher of the  deeds of Turenne, Eugene exclaimed with sparkling eyes and glowing  countenance: \"I too will become a gallant general, some day!\"    Hortense, now a girl of twelve years, lived with her mother, who was  scarcely thirty years old, in the sweet companionship of an elder and  younger sister. They were inseparable companions; Nature had given  Hortense beauty with a lavish hand; her mother gave to this beauty  grace and dignity. Competent teachers instructed her daughter's  intellect, while the mother cultivated her heart. Early accustomed to  care and want, this child had not the giddy, thoughtless disposition  usually characteristic of girls of her age. She had too early gained an  insight into the uncertainty and emptiness of all earthly magnificence,  not to appreciate the littleness of those things upon which young girls  usually place so high an estimate. Her thoughts were not occupied with  the adornment of her person, and she did not bend her young head beneath  the yoke of capricious fashion: for her, there were higher and nobler  enjoyments, and Hortense was never happier than when her mother  dispensed with her attendance at the entertainments at the house of  Madame Tallien or Madame Barras, and permitted her to remain at home, to  amuse herself with her books and harp in a better and more useful, if  not in a more agreeable manner, than she could have done in the  brilliant parlors to which her mother had repaired. Early matured in the  school of experience and suffering, the girl of twelve had acquired a  womanly earnestness and resolution, and yet her noble and chaste  features still wore the impress of childhood, and in her large blue eyes  reposed a whole heaven of innocence and peace. When she sat with her  harp at the window in the evening twilight, the last rays of the setting  sun gilding her sweet countenance, and surrounding as with a halo her  beautiful blond hair, Josephine imagined she saw before her one of those  angel-forms of innocence and love which the poet and painter portray.  In a kind of trance she listened to the sweet sounds and melodies which  Hortense lured from her harp, and accompanied with the silvery tones of  her voice, in words composed by herself, half-childish prayer, half  rhapsody of love, and revealing the most secret thoughts of the fair  young being who stood on the threshold of womanhood, bidding adieu to"]]]
