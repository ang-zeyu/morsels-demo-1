ALCESTIS.                                        I must go.    ADMETUS.  What? Dying!    ALCESTIS.               Farewell, husband!     [_She dies._]    ADMETUS (_with a cry_).                                   Ah!... Woe, woe!    LEADER.  Admetus' Queen is dead!    [_While_ ADMETUS _is weeping silently, and the_ CHORUS _veil  their faces, the_ LITTLE BOY _runs up to his dead Mother_.]    LITTLE BOY.  Oh, what has happened? Mummy has gone away,    And left me and will not come back any more!  Father, I shall be lonely all the day....    Look! Look! Her eyes ... and her arms not like before,      How they lie ...    Mother! Oh, speak a word!  Answer me, answer me, Mother! It is I.    I am touching your face. It is I, your little bird.    ADMETUS (_recovering himself and going to the Child_).  She hears us not, she sees us not. We lie  Under a heavy grief, child, thou and I.    LITTLE BOY.  I am so little, Father, and lonely and cold    Here without Mother. It is too hard.... And you,      Poor little sister, too.          Oh, Father!  Such a little time we had her. She might have stayed    On till we all were old....  Everything is spoiled when Mother is dead.    [_The_ LITTLE BOY _is taken away, with his Sister, sobbing_.]    LEADER.  My King, thou needs must gird thee to the worst.  Thou shalt not be the last, nor yet the first,  To lose a noble wife. Be brave, and know  To die is but a debt that all men owe.    ADMETUS.  I know. It came not without doubts and fears,  This thing. The thought hath poisoned all my years.    Howbeit, I now will make the burial due  To this dead Queen. Be assembled, all of you;  And, after, raise your triumph-song to greet  This pitiless Power that yawns beneath our feet.    Meantime let all in Thessaly who dread  My sceptre join in mourning for the dead  With temples sorrow-shorn and sable weed.  Ye chariot-lords, ye spurrers of the steed,  Shear close your horses' manes! Let there be found  Through all my realm no lute, nor lyre, nor sound  Of piping, till twelve moons are at an end.  For never shall I lose a closer friend,  Nor braver in my need. And worthy is she  Of honour, who alone hath died for me.    [_The body of_ ALCESTIS _is carried into the house by mourners;_  ADMETUS _follows it._]    CHORUS.  Daughter of Pelias, fare thee well,    May joy be thine in the Sunless Houses!  For thine is a deed which the Dead shall tell    Where a King black-browed in the gloom carouses;      And the cold grey hand at the helm and oar      Which guideth shadows from shore to shore,  Shall bear this day o'er the Tears that Well,    A Queen of women, a spouse of spouses.    Minstrels many shall praise thy name    With lyre full-strung and with voices lyreless,  When Mid-Moon riseth, an orbed flame,    And from dusk to dawning the dance is tireless;      And Carnos cometh to Sparta's call,      And Athens shineth in festival;  For thy death is a song, and a fullness of fame,    Till the heart of the singer is left desireless.    LEADER.  Would I could reach thee, oh,    Reach thee and save, my daughter,  Starward from gulfs of Hell,  Past gates, past tears that swell,  Where the weak oar climbs thro'    The night and the water!    SECOND ELDER.  Beloved and lonely one,    Who feared not dying:  Gone in another's stead  Alone to the hungry dead:  Light be the carven stone    Above thee lying!    THIRD ELDER.  Oh, he who should seek again    A new bride after thee,  Were loathed of thy children twain,    And loathed of me.    LEADER.  Word to his mother sped,    Praying to her who bore him;  Word to his father, old,  Heavy with years and cold;  \"Quick, ere your son be dead!    What dare ye for him?\"    SECOND ELDER.  Old, and they dared not; grey,    And they helped him never!  'Twas she, in her youth and pride,  Rose up for her lord and died.  Oh, love of two hearts that stay    One-knit for ever....    THIRD ELDER.  'Tis rare in the world! God send    Such bride in my house to be;  She should live life to the end,    Not fail through me.

To Pherae am I come  By now? And is Admetus in his home?    LEADER.  Our King is in his house, Lord Heracles.--  But say, what need brings thee in days like these  To Thessaly and Pherae's walled ring?    HERACLES.  A quest I follow for the Argive King.    LEADER.  What prize doth call thee, and to what far place?    HERACLES.  The horses of one Diomede, in Thrace.    LEADER.  But how...? Thou know'st not? Is he strange to thee?    HERACLES.  Quite strange. I ne'er set foot in Bistony.    LEADER.  Not without battle shalt thou win those steeds.    HERACLES.  So be it! I cannot fail my master's needs.    LEADER.  'Tis slay or die, win or return no more.    HERACLES.  Well, I have looked on peril's face before.    LEADER.  What profit hast thou in such manslaying?    HERACLES.  I shall bring back the horses to my King.    LEADER.  'Twere none such easy work to bridle them.    HERACLES.  Not easy? Have they nostrils breathing flame?    LEADER.  They tear men's flesh; their jaws are swift with blood.    HERACLES.  Men's flesh! 'Tis mountain wolves', not horses' food!    LEADER.  Thou wilt see their mangers clogged with blood, like mire.    HERACLES.  And he who feeds such beasts, who was his sire?    LEADER.  Ares, the war-lord of the Golden Targe.    HERACLES.  Enough!--This labour fitteth well my large  Fortune, still upward, still against the wind.  How often with these kings of Ares' kind  Must I do battle? First the dark wolf-man,  Lycaon; then 'twas he men called The Swan;  And now this man of steeds!... Well, none shall see  Alcmena's son turn from his enemy.    LEADER.  Lo, as we speak, this land's high governor,  Admetus, cometh from his castle door.    _Enter_ ADMETUS _from the Castle_.    ADMETUS.  Zeus-born of Perseid line, all joy to thee!    HERACLES.  Joy to Admetus, Lord of Thessaly!    ADMETUS.  Right welcome were she!--But thy love I know.    HERACLES.  But why this mourning hair, this garb of woe?    ADMETUS (_in a comparatively light tone_).  There is a burial I must make to-day.    HERACLES.  God keep all evil from thy children!    ADMETUS.                                        Nay,  My children live.    HERACLES.                     Thy father, if 'tis he,  Is ripe in years.    ADMETUS.                     He liveth, friend, and she  Who bore me.    HERACLES.                Surely not thy wife? 'Tis not  Alcestis?    ADMETUS (_his composure a little shaken_).             Ah; two answers share my thought,  Questioned of her.    HERACLES.                     Is she alive or dead?    ADMETUS.  She is, and is not; and my heart hath bled  Long years for her.    HERACLES.                       I understand no more.  Thy words are riddles.    ADMETUS.                          Heard'st thou not of yore  The doom that she must meet?    HERACLES.                                I know thy wife  Has sworn to die for thee.    ADMETUS.                              And is it life,  To live with such an oath hung o'er her head?    HERACLES (_relieved_).  Ah,  Weep not too soon, friend. Wait till she be dead.    ADMETUS.  He dies who is doomed to die; he is dead who dies.    HERACLES.  The two are different things in most men's eyes.    ADMETUS.  Decide thy way, lord, and let me decide  The other way.    HERACLES.                  Who is it that has died?  Thou weepest.    ADMETUS.                 'Tis a woman. It doth take  My memory back to her of whom we spake.    HERACLES.  A stranger, or of kin to thee?    ADMETUS.                                  Not kin,  But much beloved.    HERACLES.                     How came she to be in  Thy house to die?    ADMETUS.                     Her father died, and so  She came to us, an orphan, long ago.    HERACLES (_as though about to depart_).  'Tis sad.  I would I had found thee on a happier day.    ADMETUS.  Thy words have some intent: what wouldst thou say?    HERACLES.  I must find harbour with some other friend.    ADMETUS.  My prince, it may not be! God never send  Such evil!    HERACLES.              'Tis great turmoil, when a guest  Comes to a mourning house.    ADMETUS.                              Come in and rest.  Let the dead die!    HERACLES.                     I cannot, for mere shame,  Feast beside men whose eyes have tears in them.    ADMETUS.  The guest-rooms are apart where thou shalt be.    HERACLES.  Friend, let me go. I shall go gratefully.    ADMETUS.  Thou shalt not enter any door but mine.  (_To an Attendant_)  Lead in our guest. Unlock the furthest line  Of guest-chambers; and bid the stewards there  Make ready a full feast; then close with care  The midway doors. 'Tis unmeet, if he hears  Our turmoil or is burdened with our tears.    [_The Attendant leads_ HERACLES _into the house_.]    LEADER.  How, master? When within a thing so sad  Lies, thou wilt house a stranger? Art thou mad?    ADMETUS.  And had I turned the stranger from my door,  Who sought my shelter, hadst thou praised me more?  I trow not, if my sorrow were thereby  No whit less, only the more friendless I.  And more, when bards tell tales, were it not worse  My house should lie beneath the stranger's curse?  Now he is my sure friend, if e'er I stand  Lonely in Argos, in a thirsty land.    LEADER.  Thou callest him thy friend; how didst thou dare  Keep hid from him the burden of thy care?    ADMETUS.

Here, we entered at once among the trees; for they grew right up to the  edge; but we had no trouble in making a way; for they were nowhere  close together; but standing, rather, each one in a little open space  by itself.    We had gone a little way among the trees, when, suddenly, one who was  with us cried out that he could see something away on our right, and we  clutched everyone his weapon the more determinedly, and went towards it.  Yet it proved to be but a seaman's chest, and a space further off, we  discovered another. And so, after a little walking, we found the camp;  but there was small semblance of a camp about it; for the sail of which  the tent had been formed, was all torn and stained, and lay muddy upon  the ground. Yet the spring was all we had wished, clear and sweet, and so  we knew we might dream of deliverance.    Now, upon our discovery of the spring, it might be thought that we should  set up a shout to those upon the vessel; but this was not so; for there  was something in the air of the place which cast a gloom upon our  spirits, and we had no disinclination to return unto the vessel.    Upon coming to the brig, the bo'sun called to four of the men to go down  into the boats, and pass up the breakers: also, he collected all the  buckets belonging to the brig, and forthwith each of us was set to our  work. Some, those with the weapons, entered into the wood, and gave down  the water to those stationed upon the bank, and these, in turn, passed it  to those in the vessel. To the man in the galley, the bo'sun gave command  to fill a boiler with some of the most select pieces of the pork and beef  from the casks and get them cooked so soon as might be, and so we were  kept at it; for it had been determined--now that we had come upon  water--that we should stay not an hour longer in that monster-ridden  craft, and we were all agog to get the boats revictualled, and put back  to the sea, from which we had too gladly escaped.    So we worked through all that remainder of the morning, and right on into  the afternoon; for we were in mortal fear of the coming dark. Towards  four o'clock, the bo'sun sent the man, who had been set to do our  cooking, up to us with slices of salt meat upon biscuits, and we ate as  we worked, washing our throats with water from the spring, and so, before  the evening, we had filled our breakers, and near every vessel which was  convenient for us to take in the boats. More, some of us snatched the  chance to wash our bodies; for we were sore with brine, having dipped in  the sea to keep down thirst as much as might be.    Now, though it had not taken us so great a while to make a finish of our  water-carrying if matters had been more convenient; yet because of the  softness of the ground under our feet, and the care with which we had to  pick our steps, and some little distance between us and the brig, it had  grown later than we desired, before we had made an end. Therefore, when  the bo'sun sent word that we should come aboard, and bring our gear, we  made all haste. Thus, as it chanced, I found that I had left my sword  beside the spring, having placed it there to have two hands for the  carrying of one of the breakers. At my remarking my loss, George, who  stood near, cried out that he would run for it, and was gone in a moment,  being greatly curious to see the spring.    Now, at this moment, the bo'sun came up, and called for George; but I  informed him that he had run to the spring to bring me my sword. At this,  the bo'sun stamped his foot, and swore a great oath, declaring that he  had kept the lad by him all the day; having a wish to keep him from any  danger which the wood might hold, and knowing the lad's desire to  adventure there. At this, a matter which I should have known, I  reproached myself for so gross a piece of stupidity, and hastened after  the bo'sun, who had disappeared over the top of the bank. I saw his back  as he passed into the wood, and ran until I was up with him; for,  suddenly, as it were, I found that a sense of chilly dampness had come  among the trees; though a while before the place had been full of the  warmth of the sun. This, I put to the account of evening, which was  drawing on apace; and also, it must be borne in mind, that there were but  the two of us.    We came to the spring; but George was not to be seen, and I saw no sign  of my sword. At this, the bo'sun raised his voice, and cried out the  lad's name. Once he called, and again; then at the second shout we heard  the boy's shrill halloo, from some distance ahead among the trees. At  that, we ran towards the sound, plunging heavily across the ground, which  was every-where covered with a thick scum, that clogged the feet in  walking. As we ran, we hallooed, and so came upon the boy, and I saw that  he had my sword.    The bo'sun ran towards him, and caught him by the arm, speaking with  anger, and commanding him to return with us immediately to the vessel.    But the lad, for reply, pointed with my sword, and we saw that he pointed  at what appeared to be a bird against the trunk of one of the trees.  This, as I moved closer, I perceived to be a part of the tree, and no  bird; but it had a very wondrous likeness to a bird; so much so that I  went up to it, to see if my eyes had deceived me. Yet it seemed no more  than a freak of nature, though most wondrous in its fidelity; being but  an excrescence upon the trunk. With a sudden thought that it would make  me a curio, I reached up to see whether I could break it away from the  tree; but it was above my reach, so that I had to leave it. Yet, one  thing I discovered; for, in stretching towards the protuberance, I had  placed a hand upon the tree, and its trunk was soft as pulp under my  fingers, much after the fashion of a mushroom.    As we turned to go, the bo'sun inquired of George his reason for going  beyond the spring, and George told him that he had seemed to hear someone  calling to him among the trees, and there had been so much pain in the  voice that he had run towards it; but been unable to discover the owner.  Immediately afterwards he had seen the curious, bird-like excrescence  upon a tree nearby. Then we had called, and of the rest we had knowledge.    We had come nigh to the spring on our return journey, when a sudden low  whine seemed to run among the trees. I glanced towards the sky, and  realized that the evening was upon us. I was about to remark upon this to  the bo'sun, when, abruptly, he came to a stand, and bent forward to stare  into the shadows to our right. At that, George and I turned ourselves  about to perceive what matter it was which had attracted the attention of  the bo'sun; thus we made out a tree some twenty yards away, which had all  its branches wrapped about its trunk, much as the lash of a whip is wound  about its stock. Now this seemed to us a very strange sight, and we made  all of us toward it, to learn the reason of so extraordinary a happening.    Yet, when we had come close upon it, we had no means of arriving at a  knowledge of that which it portended; but walked each of us around the  tree, and were more astonished, after our circumnavigation of the great  vegetable than before.    Now, suddenly, and in the distance, I caught the far wailing that came  before the night, and abruptly, as it seemed to me, the tree wailed at  us. At that I was vastly astonished and frightened; yet, though I  retreated, I could not withdraw my gaze from the tree; but scanned it  the more intently; and, suddenly, I saw a brown, human face peering at  us from between the wrapped branches. At this, I stood very still, being  seized with that fear which renders one shortly incapable of movement.  Then, before I had possession of myself, I saw that it was of a part  with the trunk of the tree; for I could not tell where it ended and the  tree began.    Then I caught the bo'sun by the arm, and pointed; for whether it was a  part of the tree or not, it was a work of the devil; but the bo'sun, on  seeing it, ran straightway so close to the tree that he might have  touched it with his hand, and I found myself beside him. Now, George, who  was on the bo'sun's other side, whispered that there was another face,  not unlike to a woman's, and, indeed, so soon as I perceived it, I saw  that the tree had a second excrescence, most strangely after the face of  a woman. Then the bo'sun cried out with an oath, at the strangeness of  the thing, and I felt the arm, which I held, shake somewhat, as it might  be with a deep emotion. Then, far away, I heard again the sound of the  wailing and, immediately, from among the trees about us, there came  answering wails and a great sighing. And before I had time to be more  than aware of these things, the tree wailed again at us. And at that, the  bo'sun cried out suddenly that he knew; though of what it was that he  _knew_ I had at that time no knowledge. And, immediately, he began with  his cutlass to strike at the tree before us, and to cry upon God to blast  it; and lo! at his smiting a very fearsome thing happened, for the tree  did bleed like any live creature. Thereafter, a great yowling came from  it, and it began to writhe. And, suddenly, I became aware that all about  us the trees were a-quiver.    Then George cried out, and ran round upon my side of the bo'sun, and I  saw that one of the great cabbage-like things pursued him upon its stem,  even as an evil serpent; and very dreadful it was, for it had become  blood red in color; but I smote it with the sword, which I had taken from  the lad, and it fell to the ground.    Now from the brig I heard them hallooing, and the trees had become  like live things, and there was a vast growling in the air, and  hideous trumpetings. Then I caught the bo'sun"]]]
