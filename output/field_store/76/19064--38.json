That's final. I'll tell you what, Jeeves.  Give me form and pencil, and I'll wire her that I'll be with her some  time next week or the week after. Dash it all, she ought to be able to  hold out without me for a few days. It only requires will power.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Right ho, then. I'll wire 'Expect me tomorrow fortnight' or words to  some such effect. That ought to meet the case. Then if you will toddle  round the corner and send it off, that will be that.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    And so the long day wore on till it was time for me to dress for Pongo's  party.    Pongo had assured me, while chatting of the affair on the previous night,  that this birthday binge of his was to be on a scale calculated to  stagger humanity, and I must say I have participated in less fruity  functions. It was well after four when I got home, and by that time I was  about ready to turn in. I can just remember groping for the bed and  crawling into it, and it seemed to me that the lemon had scarcely touched  the pillow before I was aroused by the sound of the door opening.    I was barely ticking over, but I contrived to raise an eyelid.    \"Is that my tea, Jeeves?\"    \"No, sir. It is Mrs. Travers.\"    And a moment later there was a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and the  relative had crossed the threshold at fifty m.p.h. under her own steam.        -4-      It has been well said of Bertram Wooster that, while no one views his  flesh and blood with a keener and more remorselessly critical eye, he is  nevertheless a man who delights in giving credit where credit is due. And  if you have followed these memoirs of mine with the proper care, you will  be aware that I have frequently had occasion to emphasise the fact that  Aunt Dahlia is all right.    She is the one, if you remember, who married old Tom Travers _en secondes  noces_, as I believe the expression is, the year Bluebottle won the  Cambridgeshire, and once induced me to write an article on What the  Well-Dressed Man is Wearing for that paper she runs--_Milady's Boudoir_.  She is a large, genial soul, with whom it is a pleasure to hob-nob. In her  spiritual make-up there is none of that subtle gosh-awfulness which  renders such an exhibit as, say, my Aunt Agatha the curse of the Home  Counties and a menace to one and all. I have the highest esteem for Aunt  Dahlia, and have never wavered in my cordial appreciation of her  humanity, sporting qualities and general good-eggishness.    This being so, you may conceive of my astonishment at finding her at my  bedside at such an hour. I mean to say, I've stayed at her place many a  time and oft, and she knows my habits. She is well aware that until I  have had my cup of tea in the morning, I do not receive. This crashing in  at a moment when she knew that solitude and repose were of the essence  was scarcely, I could not but feel, the good old form.    Besides, what business had she being in London at all? That was what I  asked myself. When a conscientious housewife has returned to her home  after an absence of seven weeks, one does not expect her to start racing  off again the day after her arrival. One feels that she ought to be  sticking round, ministering to her husband, conferring with the cook,  feeding the cat, combing and brushing the Pomeranian--in a word, staying  put. I was more than a little bleary-eyed, but I endeavoured, as far as  the fact that my eyelids were more or less glued together would permit,  to give her an austere and censorious look.    She didn't seem to get it.    \"Wake up, Bertie, you old ass!\" she cried, in a voice that hit me between  the eyebrows and went out at the back of my head.    If Aunt Dahlia has a fault, it is that she is apt to address a _vis-a-vis_  as if he were somebody half a mile away whom she had observed riding  over hounds. A throwback, no doubt, to the time when she counted the day  lost that was not spent in chivvying some unfortunate fox over the  countryside.    I gave her another of the austere and censorious, and this time it  registered. All the effect it had, however, was to cause her to descend  to personalities.    \"Don't blink at me in that obscene way,\" she said. \"I wonder, Bertie,\"  she proceeded, gazing at me as I should imagine Gussie would have gazed  at some newt that was not up to sample, \"if you have the faintest  conception how perfectly loathsome you look? A cross between an orgy  scene in the movies and some low form of pond life. I suppose you were  out on the tiles last night?\"    \"I attended a social function, yes,\" I said coldly. \"Pongo Twistleton's  birthday party. I couldn't let Pongo down. _Noblesse oblige_.\"    \"Well, get up and dress.\"    I felt I could not have heard her aright.    \"Get up and dress?\"    \"Yes.\"    I turned on the pillow with a little moan, and at this juncture Jeeves  entered with the vital oolong. I clutched at it like a drowning man at a  straw hat. A deep sip or two, and I felt--I won't say restored, because a  birthday party like Pongo Twistleton's isn't a thing you get restored  after with a mere mouthful of tea, but sufficiently the old Bertram to be  able to bend the mind on this awful thing which had come upon me.    And the more I bent same, the less could I grasp the trend of the  scenario.    \"What is this, Aunt Dahlia?\" I inquired.    \"It looks to me like tea,\" was her response. \"But you know best. You're  drinking it.\"    If I hadn't been afraid of spilling the healing brew, I have little doubt  that I should have given an impatient gesture. I know I felt like it.    \"Not the contents of this cup. All this. Your barging in and telling me  to get up and dress, and all that rot.\"    \"I've barged in, as you call it, because my telegrams seemed to produce  no effect. And I told you to get up and dress because I want you to get  up and dress. I've come to take you back with me. I like your crust,  wiring that you would come next year or whenever it was. You're coming  now. I've got a job for you.\"    \"But I don't want a job.\"    \"What you want, my lad, and what you're going to get are two very  different things. There is man's work for you to do at Brinkley Court. Be  ready to the last button in twenty minutes.\"    \"But I can't possibly be ready to any buttons in twenty minutes. I'm  feeling awful.\"    She seemed to consider.    \"Yes,\" she said. \"I suppose it's only humane to give you a day or two to  recover. All right, then, I shall expect you on the thirtieth at the  latest.\"    \"But, dash it, what is all this? How do you mean, a job? Why a job? What  sort of a job?\"    \"I'll tell you if you'll only stop talking for a minute. It's quite an  easy, pleasant job. You will enjoy it. Have you ever heard of Market  Snodsbury Grammar School?\"    \"Never.\"    \"It's a grammar school at Market Snodsbury.\"    I told her a little frigidly that I had divined as much.    \"Well, how was I to know that a man with a mind like yours would grasp it  so quickly?\" she protested. \"All right, then. Market Snodsbury Grammar  School is, as you have guessed, the grammar school at Market Snodsbury.  I'm one of the governors.\"    \"You mean one of the governesses.\"    \"I don't mean one of the governesses. Listen, ass. There was a board of  governors at Eton, wasn't there? Very well. So there is at Market  Snodsbury Grammar School, and I'm a member of it. And they left the  arrangements for the summer prize-giving to me. This prize-giving takes  place on the last--or thirty-first--day of this month. Have you got that  clear?\"    I took another oz. of the life-saving and inclined my head. Even after a  Pongo Twistleton birthday party, I was capable of grasping simple facts  like these.    \"I follow you, yes. I see the point you are trying to make, certainly.  Market ... Snodsbury ... Grammar School ... Board of governors ...  Prize-giving.... Quite. But what's it got to do with me?\"    \"You're going to give away the prizes.\"    I goggled. Her words did not appear to make sense. They seemed the mere  aimless vapouring of an aunt who has been sitting out in the sun without  a hat.    \"Me?\"    \"You.\"    I goggled again.    \"You don't mean me?\"    \"I mean you in person.\"    I goggled a third time.    \"You're pulling my leg.\"    \"I am not pulling your leg. Nothing would induce me to touch your beastly  leg. The vicar was to have officiated, but when I got home I found a  letter from him saying that he had strained a fetlock and must scratch  his nomination. You can imagine the state I was in. I telephoned all over  the place. Nobody would take it on. And then suddenly I thought of you.\"    I decided to check all this rot at the outset. Nobody is more eager to  oblige deserving aunts than Bertram Wooster, but there are limits, and  sharply defined limits, at that.    \"So you think I'm going to strew prizes at this bally Dotheboys Hall of  yours?\"    \"I do.\"    \"And make a speech?\"    \"Exactly.\"    I laughed derisively.    \"For goodness' sake, don't start gargling now. This is serious.\"    \"I was laughing.\"    \"Oh, were you? Well, I'm glad to see you taking it in this merry spirit.\"    \"Derisively,\" I explained. \"I won't do it. That's final. I simply will  not do it.\"    \"You will do it, young Bertie, or never darken my doors again. And you  know what that means. No more of Anatole's dinners for you.\"    A strong shudder shook me. She was alluding to her _chef_, that superb  artist. A monarch of his profession, unsurpassed--nay, unequalled--at  dishing up the raw material so that it melted in the mouth of the  ultimate consumer, Anatole had always been a magnet that drew me to  Brinkley Court with my tongue hanging out. Many of my happiest moments  had been those which I had spent champing this great man's roasts and  ragouts, and the prospect of being barred from digging into them in the  future was a numbing one.    \"No, I say, dash it!\"    \"I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10556"],[0,"The Old Man in the Corner (#5)"],[1,"and realized  that he was not there, she felt conscious of an overwhelming sense of  disappointment. And yet during the whole of the week she had, with more  pride than wisdom, avoided this particular A.B.C. shop.    \"I thought you would not keep away very long,\" said a quiet voice close  to her ear.    She nearly lost her balance--where in the world had he come from? She  certainly had not heard the slightest sound, and yet there he sat, in  the corner, like a veritable Jack-in-the-box, his mild blue eyes staring  apologetically at her, his nervous fingers toying with the inevitable  bit of string.    The waitress brought him his glass of milk and a cheese-cake. He ate it  in silence, while his piece of string lay idly beside him on the table.  When he had finished he fumbled in his capacious pockets, and drew out  the inevitable pocket-book.    Placing a small photograph before the girl, he said quietly:    \"That is the back of the houses in Phillimore Terrace, which overlook  Adam and Eve Mews.\"    She looked at the photograph, then at him, with a kindly look of  indulgent expectancy.    \"You will notice that the row of back gardens have each an exit into the  mews. These mews are built in the shape of a capital F. The photograph  is taken looking straight down the short horizontal line, which ends, as  you see, in a _cul-de-sac_. The bottom of the vertical line turns into  Phillimore Terrace, and the end of the upper long horizontal line into  High Street, Kensington. Now, on that particular night, or rather early  morning, of January 15th, Constable D 21, having turned into the mews  from Phillimore Terrace, stood for a moment at the angle formed by the  long vertical artery of the mews and the short horizontal one which, as  I observed before, looks on to the back gardens of the Terrace houses,  and ends in a _cul-de-sac_.    \"How long D 21 stood at that particular corner he could not exactly say,  but he thinks it must have been three or four minutes before he noticed  a suspicious-looking individual shambling along under the shadow of the  garden walls. He was working his way cautiously in the direction of the  _cul-de-sac_, and D 21, also keeping well within the shadow, went  noiselessly after him.    \"He had almost overtaken him--was, in fact, not more than thirty yards  from him--when from out of one of the two end houses--No. 22, Phillimore  Terrace, in fact--a man, in nothing but his night-shirt, rushed out  excitedly, and, before D 21 had time to intervene, literally threw  himself upon the suspected individual, rolling over and over with him on  the hard cobble-stones, and frantically shrieking, 'Thief! Thief!  Police!'    \"It was some time before the constable succeeded in rescuing the tramp  from the excited grip of his assailant, and several minutes before he  could make himself heard.    \"'There! there! that'll do!' he managed to say at last, as he gave the  man in the shirt a vigorous shove, which silenced him for the moment.  'Leave the man alone now, you mustn't make that noise this time o'  night, wakin' up all the folks.' The unfortunate tramp, who in the  meanwhile had managed to get onto his feet again, made no attempt to  get away; probably he thought he would stand but a poor chance. But the  man in the shirt had partly recovered his power of speech, and was now  blurting out jerky, half--intelligible sentences:    \"'I have been robbed--robbed--I--that is--my master--Mr. Knopf. The desk  is open--the diamonds gone--all in my charge--and--now they are stolen!  That's the thief--I'll swear--I heard him--not three minutes ago--rushed  downstairs--the door into the garden was smashed--I ran across the  garden--he was sneaking about here still--Thief! Thief! Police!  Diamonds! Constable, don't let him go--I'll make you responsible if you  let him go--'    \"'Now then--that'll do!' admonished D 21 as soon as he could get a word  in, 'stop that row, will you?'    \"The man in the shirt was gradually recovering from his excitement.    \"'Can I give this man in charge?' he asked.    \"'What for?'    \"'Burglary and housebreaking. I heard him, I tell you. He must have Mr.  Knopf's diamonds about him at this moment.'    \"'Where is Mr. Knopf?'    \"'Out of town,' groaned the man in the shirt. 'He went to Brighton last  night, and left me in charge, and now this thief has been and--'    \"The tramp shrugged his shoulders and suddenly, without a word, he  quietly began taking off his coat and waistcoat. These he handed across  to the constable. Eagerly the man in the shirt fell on them, and turned  the ragged pockets inside out. From one of the windows a hilarious voice  made some facetious remark, as the tramp with equal solemnity began  divesting himself of his nether garments.    \"'Now then, stop that nonsense,' pronounced D 21 severely, 'what were  you doing here this time o' night, anyway?'    \"'The streets o' London is free to the public, ain't they?' queried the  tramp.    \"'This don't lead nowhere, my man.'    \"'Then I've lost my way, that's all,' growled the man surlily, 'and  p'raps you'll let me get along now.'    \"By this time a couple of constables had appeared upon the scene. D 21  had no intention of losing sight of his friend the tramp, and the man in  the shirt had again made a dash for the latter's collar at the bare idea  that he should be allowed to 'get along.'    \"I think D 21 was alive to the humour of the situation. He suggested  that Robertson (the man in the night-shirt) should go in and get some  clothes on, whilst he himself would wait for the inspector and the  detective, whom D 15 would send round from the station immediately.    \"Poor Robertson's teeth were chattering with cold. He had a violent fit  of sneezing as D 21 hurried him into the house. The latter, with another  constable, remained to watch the burglared premises both back and  front, and D 15 took the wretched tramp to the station with a view to  sending an inspector and a detective round immediately.    \"When the two latter gentlemen arrived at No. 22, Phillimore Terrace,  they found poor old Robertson in bed, shivering, and still quite blue.  He had got himself a hot drink, but his eyes were streaming and his  voice was terribly husky. D 21 had stationed himself in the dining-room,  where Robertson had pointed the desk out to him, with its broken lock  and scattered contents.    \"Robertson, between his sneezes, gave what account he could of the  events which happened immediately before the robbery.    \"His master, Mr. Ferdinand Knopf, he said, was a diamond merchant, and a  bachelor. He himself had been in Mr. Knopf's employ over fifteen years,  and was his only indoor servant. A charwoman came every day to do the  housework.    \"Last night Mr. Knopf dined at the house of Mr. Shipman, at No. 26,  lower down. Mr. Shipman is the great jeweller who has his place of  business in South Audley Street. By the last post there came a letter  with the Brighton postmark, and marked 'urgent,' for Mr. Knopf, and he  (Robertson) was just wondering if he should run over to No. 26 with it,  when his master returned. He gave one glance at the contents of the  letter, asked for his A.B.C. Railway Guide, and ordered him (Robertson)  to pack his bag at once and fetch him a cab.    \"'I guessed what it was,' continued Robertson after another violent fit  of sneezing. 'Mr. Knopf has a brother, Mr. Emile Knopf, to whom he is  very much attached, and who is a great invalid. He generally goes about  from one seaside place to another. He is now at Brighton, and has  recently been very ill.    \"'If you will take the trouble to go downstairs I think you will still  find the letter lying on the hall table.    \"'I read it after Mr. Knopf left; it was not from his brother, but from  a gentleman who signed himself J. Collins, M.D. I don't remember the  exact words, but, of course, you'll be able to read the letter--Mr. J.  Collins said he had been called in very suddenly to see Mr. Emile Knopf,  who, he added, had not many hours to live, and had begged of the doctor  to communicate at once with his brother in London.    \"'Before leaving, Mr. Knopf warned me that there were some valuables in  his desk--diamonds mostly, and told me to be particularly careful about  locking up the house. He often has left me like this in charge of his  premises, and usually there have been diamonds in his desk, for Mr.  Knopf has no regular City office as he is a commercial traveller.'    \"This, briefly, was the gist of the matter which Robertson related to  the inspector with many repetitions and persistent volubility.    \"The detective and inspector, before returning to the station with their  report, thought they would call at No. 26, on Mr. Shipman, the great  jeweller.    \"You remember, of course,\" added the man in the corner, dreamily  contemplating his bit of string, \"the exciting developments of this  extraordinary case. Mr. Arthur Shipman is the head of the firm of  Shipman and Co., the wealthy jewellers. He is a widower, and lives very  quietly by himself in his own old-fashioned way in the small Kensington  house, leaving it to his two married sons to keep up the style and  swagger befitting the representatives of so wealthy a firm.    \"'I have only known Mr. Knopf a very little while,' he explained to the  detectives. 'He sold me two or three stones once or twice, I think; but  we are both single men, and we have often dined together. Last night he  dined with me. He had that afternoon received a very fine consignment of  Brazilian diamonds, as he told me, and knowing how beset I am with  callers at my business place, he had brought the stones with him,  hoping, perhaps, to do a bit of trade over the nuts and wine.    \"'I bought L25,000 worth of him,' added the jeweller, as if he were  speaking of so many farthings, 'and gave him a cheque across the dinner  table for that amount.
