The king was, and continued to the last, the  absolute and dread master of all his family, to its remotest branches.    He lost through this obedience a great deal that is charming and sweet  in daily intercourse.  For him and for Madame de Maintenon the great and  inexhaustible attraction of the Duchess of Burgundy was her gayety and  unconstrained ease, tempered by the most delicate respect, which this  young princess, on coming as quite a child to France from the court of  Savoy, had tact enough to introduce, and always maintain, amidst the most  intimate familiarity.  \"In public, demure, respectful with the king, and  on terms of timid propriety with Madame de Maintenon, whom she never  called anything but aunt, thus prettily blending rank and affection.  In private, chattering, frisking, fluttering around them, at one time  perched on the arm of one or the other's chair, at another playfully  sitting on their knee, she would throw herself upon their necks, embrace  them, kiss them, fondle them, pull them to pieces, chuck them under the  chin, tease them, rummage their tables, their papers, their letters,  reading them sometimes against their will, according as she saw that they  were in the humor to laugh at it, and occasionally speaking thereon.  Admitted to everything, even at the reception of couriers bringing the  most important news, going into the king at any hour, even at the time  the council was sitting, useful and also fatal to ministers themselves,  but always inclined to help, to excuse, to benefit, unless she were  violently set against anybody.  The king could not do without her; when,  rarely, she was absent from his supper in public, it was plainly shown by  a cloud of more than usual gravity and taciturnity over the king's whole  person; and so, when it happened that some ball in winter or some party  in summer made her break into the night, she arranged matters so well  that she was there to kiss the king the moment he was awake, and to amuse  him with an account of the affair.\"  [Memoires de St. Simon, t. x.  p. 186.]    [Illustration: Madame de Maintenon and the Duchess of Burgundy.----27]    The dauphiness had died in 1690; the Duchess of Burgundy was, therefore,  almost from childhood queen of the court, and before long the idol of the  courtiers; it was around her that pleasures sprang up; it was for her  that the king gave the entertainments to which he had habituated  Versailles, not that for her sake or to take care of her health he would  ever consent to modify his habits or make the least change in his plans.  \"Thank God, it is over!\"  he exclaimed one day, after an accident to the  princess; \"I shall no longer be thwarted in my trips, and in all I desire  to do, by the representations of physicians.  I shall come and go as I  fancy; and I shall be left in peace.\"  Even in his court, and amongst his  most devoted servants, this monstrous egotism astounded and scandalized  everybody.  \"A silence in which you might have heard an ant move  succeeded this sally,\" says St. Simon, who relates the scene; \"we looked  down; we hardly dared draw breath.  Everybody stood aghast.  To the very  builders-men and gardeners everybody was motionless.  This silence lasted  more than a quarter of an hour.  The king broke it, as he leaned against  a balustrade of the great basin, to speak about a carp.  Nobody made any  answer.  He afterwards addressed his remarks about these carp to some  builder's-men who did not keep up the conversation in the regular way; it  was but a question of carp with them.  Everything was at a low ebb, and  the king went away some little time after.  As soon as we dared look at  one another out of his sight, our eyes meeting told all.\"  There was no  venturing beyond looks.  Fenelon had said, with severe charity, \"God will  have compassion upon a prince beset from his youth up by flatterers.\"    Flattery ran a risk of becoming hypocrisy.  On returning to a regular  life, the king was for imposing the same upon his whole court; the  instinct of order and regularity, smothered for a while in the heyday of  passion, had resumed all its sway over the naturally proper and steady  mind of Louis XIV.  His dignity and his authority were equally involved  in the cause of propriety and regularity at his court; he imposed this  yoke as well as all the others; there appeared to be entire obedience;  only some princes or princesses escaped it sometimes, getting about them  a few free-thinkers or boon-companions; good, honest folks showed  ingenuous joy; the virtuous and far-sighted were secretly uneasy at the  falsehood, and deplored the pressure put on so many consciences and so  many lives.  The king was sincere in his repentance for the past, many  persons in his court were as sincere as he; others, who were not,  affected, in order to please him, the externals of austerity; absolute  power oppressed all spirits, extorting from them that hypocritical  complaisance which is liable to engender; corruption was already brooding  beneath appearances of piety; the reign of Louis XV. was to see its  deplorable fruits displayed with a haste and a scandal which are to be  explained only by the oppression exercised in the last years of King  Louis XIV.    Madame de Maintenon was like the genius of this reaction towards  regularity, propriety, order; all the responsibility for it had been  thrown upon her; the good she did has disappeared beneath the evil she  allowed or encouraged; the regard lavished upon her by the king has  caused illusions as to the discreet care she was continually taking to  please him.  She was faithful to her friends, so long as they were in  favor with the king; if they had the misfortune to displease him, she,  at the very least, gave up seeing them; without courage or hardihood to  withstand the caprices and wishes of Louis XIV., she had gained and  preserved her empire by dint of dexterity and far-sighted suppleness  beneath the externals of dignity.    She never forgot her origin.  \"I am not a grandee,\" she would say;  \"I am a mushroom.\"  Her life, entirely devoted to the king, had become a  veritable slavery; she said as much to Mdlle. d'Aumale at St. Cyr.  \"I  have to take for my prayers and for mass the time when everybody else is  still sleeping.  For, when once they begin coming into my room, at half  past seven, I haven't another moment to myself.  They come filing in, and  nobody goes out without being relieved by somebody higher.  At last comes  the king; then, of course, they all have to go out; he remains with me up  to mass.  I am, still in my night-cap.  The king comes back after mass;  then the Duchess of Burgundy with her ladies.  They remain whilst I dine.  I have to keep up the conversation, which flags every moment, and to  manage so as to harmonize minds and reconcile hearts which are as far as  possible asunder.  The circle is all round me, and I cannot ask for  anything to drink; I sometimes say to them (aside), 'It is a great honor,  but really I should prefer a footman.'  At last they all go away to  dinner.  I should be free during that time, if Monseigneur did not  generally choose it for coming to see me, for he often dines earlier in  order to go hunting.  He is very difficult to entertain, having very  little to say, and finding himself a bore, and running away from himself  continually; so I have to talk for two.  Immediately after the king has  dined, he comes into my room with all the royal family, princes and  princesses; then I must be prepared for the gayest of conversation, and  wear a smiling face amidst so much distressing news.  When this company  disperses, some lady has always something particular to say to me; the  Duchess of Burgundy also wants to have a chat.  The king returns from  hunting.  He comes to me.  The door is shut, and nobody else is admitted.  Then I have to share his secret troubles, which are no small number.  Arrives a minister; and the king sets himself to work.  If I am not  wanted at this consultation, which seldom happens, I withdraw to some  farther distance and write or pray.  I sup, whilst the king is still at  work.  I am restless, whether he is alone or not.  The king says to me,  'You are tired, Madame; go to bed.'  My women come.  But I feel that they  interfere with the king, who would chat with me, and does not like to  chat before them; or, perhaps, there are some ministers still there, whom  he is afraid they may overhear.  Wherefore I make haste to undress, so  much so that I often feel quite ill from it.  At last I am in bed.  The  king comes up and remains by my pillow until he goes to supper.  But a  quarter of an hour before supper, the dauphin and the Duke and Duchess of  Burgundy come in to me again.  At ten, everybody goes out.  At last I am  alone, but very often the fatigues of the day prevent me from sleeping.\"    She was at that time seventy.  She was often ailing; but the Duchess of  Burgundy was still very young, and the burden of the most private matters  of court diplomacy fell entirely upon Madame de Maintenon.  \"The Princess  des Ursins is about to return to Spain,\" she said; \"if I do not take her  in hand, if I do not repair by my attentions the coldness of the Duchess  of Burgundy, the indifference of the king and the curtness of the other  princes, she will go away displeased with our court, and it is expedient  that she should praise it, and speak well of it in Spain.\"    It was, in fact, through Madame de Maintenon and her correspondence with  the Princess des Ursins, that the private business between the two courts  of France and Spain was often carried on.  At Madrid, far more than at  Versailles, the influence of women was all-powerful.  The queen ruled her  husband, who was honest and courageous, but without wit or daring; and  the Princess des Ursins ruled the queen, as intelligent and as amiable as  her sister"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12014"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume IV.

He was  modest to a fault, entertaining the most humble opinion of his own  performances; and was always ready to do justice to those of others.  His affection for his friends indeed sometimes biassed his judgment,  and led him to the commending their writings beyond their merit.'    In the volume of Mr. Needler's works, are printed some familiar  Letters, upon moral, and natural subjects. They are written with  elegance and taste; the heart of a good man may be traced in them  all, and equally abound with pious notions, as good sense, and  solid reasoning.--He seems to have been very much master of smooth  versification, his subjects are happily chosen, and there is a  philosophical air runs through all his writings; as an instance of  this, we shall present our readers with a copy of his verses addressed  to Sir Richard Blackmore, on his Poem, intitled The Creation.        Dress'd in the charms of wit and fancy, long    The muse has pleas'd us with her syren song;    But weak of reason, and deprav'd of mind,    Too oft on vile, ignoble themes we find    The wanton muse her sacred art debase,    Forgetful of her birth, and heavenly race;    Too oft her flatt'ring songs to sin intice,    And in false colours deck delusive vice;    Too oft she condescends, in servile lays,    The undeserving rich and great to praise.    These beaten paths, thy loftier strains refuse    With just disdain, and nobler subjects chuse:    Fir'd with sublimer thoughts, thy daring soul    Wings her aspiring flight from Pole to Pole,    Observes the foot-steps of a pow'r divine,    Which in each part of nature's system shine;    Surveys the wonders of this beauteous frame,    And sings the sacred source, whence all things came.        But Oh! what numbers shall I find to tell,    The mighty transports which my bosom swell,    Whilst, guided by thy tuneful voice, I stray    Thro' radiant worlds, and fields of native day,    Wasted from orb, to orb, unwearied fly    Thro' the blue regions of the yielding sky;    See how the spheres in stated courses roll,    And view the just composure of the whole!        Such were the strains, by antient Orpheus sung.    To such, Mufaeus' heav'nly lyre was strung;    Exalted truths, in learned verse they told,    And nature's deepest secrets did unfold.    How at th' eternal mind's omnisic call,    Yon starry arch, and this terrestrial ball,    The briny wave, the blazing source of light,    And the wane empress of the silent night,    Each in it's order rose and took its place,    And filled with recent forms the vacant space;    How rolling planets trace their destin'd way,    Nor in the wastes of pathless AEther stray;    How the pale moon, with silver beams adorn    Her chearful orb, and gilds her sharpened horns;    How the vast ocean's swelling tides obey    Her distant reign, and own her watr'y sway;    How erring floods, their circling course maintain,    Supplied by constant succours from the main;    Whilst to the sea, the refluent streams restore,    The liquid treasures which she lent before;    What dreadful veil obscures the solar light,    And Phaebe's darken'd face conceals from mortal sight.    Thy learned muse, I with like pleasure hear    The wonders of the lesser world declare,    Point out the various marks of skill divine,    Which thro' its complicated structure mine,    In tuneful verse, the vital current trace,    Thro' all the windings of its mazy race,    And tell hew the rich purple tide bestows,    Vigour, and kindly warmth where e'er it flows;    By what contrivance of mechanic art    The muscles, motions to the limbs impart;    How at th' imperial mind's impulsive nod,    Th' obedient spirits thro' the nervous road    Find thro' their fib'rous cells the ready way,    And the high dictates of the will obey;    From how exact and delicate a frame,    The channeled bones their nimble action claim;    With how much depth, and subtility of thought    The curious organ of the eye is wrought;    How from the brain their root the nerves derive,    And sense to ev'ry distant member give.        Th' extensive knowledge you of men enjoy,    You to a double use of man employ;    Nor to the body, is your skill confin'd,    Of error's worse disease you heal the mind.    No longer shall the hardy atheist praise    Lucretius' piercing wit, and philosophic lays;    But by your lines convinc'd, and charm'd at once,    His impious tenets shall at length renounce,    At length to truth and eloquence shall yield,    Confess himself subdu'd, and wisely quit the field.      [Footnote A: See his Life prefixed to his works, by William Duncomb  Esq;]           *       *       *       *       *          JOHN HUGHES,      William Duncomb, esq; has obliged the world with an entire edition of  this author's poetical and prose works, to which he has prefixed  some account of his life, written with candour and spirit. Upon his  authority we chiefly build the following narration; in which we shall  endeavour to do as much justice as possible to the memory of this  excellent poet.    Our author was the son of a worthy citizen of London, and born at  Marlborough in the county of Wilts, on the 29th of January 1677; but  received the rudiments of his learning at private schools in London.    In the earliest years of his youth, he applied himself with ardour to  the pursuit of the sister arts, poetry, drawing and music, in each of  which by turns, he made a considerable progress; but for the most part  pursued these and other polite studies, only as agreeable amusements,  under frequent confinement from indisposition, and a valetudinary  state of health. He had some time an employment in the office of  ordinance; and was secretary to two or three commissioners under the  great-seal, for purchasing lands for the better securing the docks and  harbours at Portsmouth, Chatham, and Harwich.    In the year 1717 the lord chancellor Cowper, (to whom Mr. Hughes  was then but lately known) was pleased, without any previous  sollicitation, to make him his secretary for the commissions of the  peace, and to distinguish him with singular marks of his favour and  affection: And upon his lordship's laying down the great-seal, he was  at his particular recommendation, and with the ready concurrence of  his successor, continued in the same employment under the earl of  Macclesfield.    He held this place to the time of his decease, which happened on the  17th of February 1719, the very night in which his tragedy, entitled  the Siege of Damascus, was first acted at the Theatre-Royal in  Drury-Lane.    He was cut off by a consumption, after a painful life, at the age of  42, when he had just arrived at an agreeable competence, and advancing  in fame and fortune. So just is the beautiful reflexion of Milton in  his Lycidas;      Fame is the spur, that the clear spirit doth raise,      (That last infirmity of noble mind)    To scorn delights, and live laborious days;      But the fair guerdon, when we hops to find,    And think to burst out into sudden blaze,      Comes the blind fury with th' abhorred shears,    And slits the thin-spun life.--    He was privately buried in the vault under the chancel of St. Andrew's  Church in Holborn. Mr. Hughes, as a testimony of gratitude to his  noble friend, and generous patron, earl Cowper, gave his lordship a  few weeks before he died, his picture drawn by Sir Godfrey Kneller,  which he himself had received from that masterly painter. The value  lord Cowper set upon it will be best shewn, by the letter he wrote  upon this occasion to Mr. Hughes. As such a testimony from so eminent  a person, was considered by himself as one of the highest honours he  was capable of receiving, we shall therefore insert it.    24th Jan. 1719-20.    'Sir,    'I thank you for the most acceptable present of your picture, and  assure you that none of this age can set a higher value on it than I  do, and shall while I live, tho' I am sensible posterity will out-do  me in that particular.'    I am with the greatest esteem, and sincerity    Your most affectionate, and oblig'd humble servant    COWPER.    Mr. Hughes was happy in the acquaintance and friendship of several of  the greatest men, and most distinguished genius's of the age in which  he lived; particularly of the nobleman just now mentioned, the present  lord bishop of Winchester, lord chief baron Gilbert, Sir Godfrey  Kneller, Mr. Congreve, Mr. Addison, Sir Richard Steele, Mr. Southern,  Mr. Rowe, &c. and might have justly boasted in the words of Horace      ----me    Cum magnis vixisse, invita fatebitu usque    Invidia.----    Having given this short account of his life, which perhaps is all  that is preserved any where concerning him; we shall now consider him,  first, as a poet, and then as a prose writer.    The Triumph of Peace was the earliest poem he wrote of any length,  that appeared in public. It was written on occasion of the peace  of Ryswick, and printed in the year 1677. A learned gentleman at  Cambridge, in a letter to a friend of Mr. Hughes's, dated the 28th  of February 1697-8, gives the following account of the favourable  reception this poem met with there, upon its first publication.    'I think I never heard a poem read with so much admiration, as the  Triumph of Peace was by our best critics here, nor a greater character  given to a young poet, at his first appearing; no, not even to Mr.  Congreve himself. So nobly elevated are his thoughts, his numbers so  harmonious, and his turns so fine and delicate, that we cry out with  Tully, on a like occasion,      'Nostrae spes altera Romae!'    The Court of Neptune, was written on king William's return from  Holland, two years after the peace, in 1699. This Poem was admired  for the verification, however, the"]]]
