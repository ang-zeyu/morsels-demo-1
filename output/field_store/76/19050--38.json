He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,  The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers  To guide them, so that each part shines to each,  Their light in equal distribution pour'd.  By similar appointment he ordain'd  Over the world's bright images to rule.  Superintendence of a guiding hand  And general minister, which at due time  May change the empty vantages of life  From race to race, from one to other's blood,  Beyond prevention of man's wisest care:  Wherefore one nation rises into sway,  Another languishes, e'en as her will  Decrees, from us conceal'd, as in the grass  The serpent train.  Against her nought avails  Your utmost wisdom.  She with foresight plans,  Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs  The other powers divine.  Her changes know  Nore intermission:  by necessity  She is made swift, so frequent come who claim  Succession in her favours.  This is she,  So execrated e'en by those, whose debt  To her is rather praise; they wrongfully  With blame requite her, and with evil word;  But she is blessed, and for that recks not:  Amidst the other primal beings glad  Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults.  Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe  Descending:  for each star is falling now,  That mounted at our entrance, and forbids  Too long our tarrying.\"  We the circle cross'd  To the next steep, arriving at a well,  That boiling pours itself down to a foss  Sluic'd from its source.  Far murkier was the wave  Than sablest grain:  and we in company  Of the' inky waters, journeying by their side,  Enter'd, though by a different track, beneath.  Into a lake, the Stygian nam'd, expands  The dismal stream, when it hath reach'd the foot  Of the grey wither'd cliffs.  Intent I stood  To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried  A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks  Betok'ning rage.  They with their hands alone  Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,  Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.       The good instructor spake; \"Now seest thou, son!  The souls of those, whom anger overcame.  This too for certain know, that underneath  The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs  Into these bubbles make the surface heave,  As thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn.  Fix'd in the slime they say: \"Sad once were we  In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,  Carrying a foul and lazy mist within:  Now in these murky settlings are we sad.\"  Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.  But word distinct can utter none.\"  Our route  Thus compass'd we, a segment widely stretch'd  Between the dry embankment, and the core  Of the loath'd pool, turning meanwhile our eyes  Downward on those who gulp'd its muddy lees;  Nor stopp'd, till to a tower's low base we came.        CANTO VIII    MY theme pursuing, I relate that ere  We reach'd the lofty turret's base, our eyes  Its height ascended, where two cressets hung  We mark'd, and from afar another light  Return the signal, so remote, that scarce  The eye could catch its beam.  I turning round  To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir'd:  \"Say what this means?  and what that other light  In answer set?  what agency doth this?\"       \"There on the filthy waters,\" he replied,  \"E'en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,  If the marsh-gender'd fog conceal it not.\"       Never was arrow from the cord dismiss'd,  That ran its way so nimbly through the air,  As a small bark, that through the waves I spied  Toward us coming, under the sole sway  Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:  \"Art thou arriv'd, fell spirit?\"--\"Phlegyas, Phlegyas,  This time thou criest in vain,\" my lord replied;  \"No longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er  The slimy pool we pass.\"  As one who hears  Of some great wrong he hath sustain'd, whereat  Inly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin'd  In his fierce ire.  My guide descending stepp'd  Into the skiff, and bade me enter next  Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem'd  The vessel freighted.  Soon as both embark'd,  Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,  More deeply than with others it is wont.       While we our course o'er the dead channel held.  One drench'd in mire before me came, and said;  \"Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?\"       I answer'd: \"Though I come, I tarry not;  But who art thou, that art become so foul?\"       \"One, as thou seest, who mourn: \" he straight replied.       To which I thus: \" In mourning and in woe,  Curs'd spirit!  tarry thou. I know thee well,  E'en thus in filth disguis'd.\"  Then stretch'd he forth  Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage  Aware, thrusting him back: \"Away!  down there  To the' other dogs!\"  then, with his arms my neck  Encircling, kiss'd my cheek, and spake: \"O soul  Justly disdainful!  blest was she in whom  Thou was conceiv'd!  He in the world was one  For arrogance noted; to his memory  No virtue lends its lustre; even so  Here is his shadow furious.  There above  How many now hold themselves mighty kings  Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire,  Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!\"       I then: \"Master!  him fain would I behold  Whelm'd in these dregs, before we quit the lake.\"       He thus: \"Or ever to thy view the shore  Be offer'd, satisfied shall be that wish,  Which well deserves completion.\"  Scarce his words  Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes  Set on him with such violence, that yet  For that render I thanks to God and praise  \"To Filippo Argenti:\" cried they all:  And on himself the moody Florentine  Turn'd his avenging fangs.  Him here we left,  Nor speak I of him more.  But on mine ear  Sudden a sound of lamentation smote,  Whereat mine eye unbarr'd I sent abroad.       And thus the good instructor: \"Now, my son!  Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam'd,  With its grave denizens, a mighty throng.\"       I thus: \"The minarets already, Sir!  There certes in the valley I descry,  Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire  Had issu'd.\"  He replied: \"Eternal fire,  That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame  Illum'd; as in this nether hell thou seest.\"       We came within the fosses deep, that moat  This region comfortless.  The walls appear'd  As they were fram'd of iron.  We had made  Wide circuit, ere a place we reach'd, where loud  The mariner cried vehement: \"Go forth!  The' entrance is here!\"  Upon the gates I spied  More than a thousand, who of old from heaven  Were hurl'd.  With ireful gestures, \"Who is this,\"  They cried, \"that without death first felt, goes through  The regions of the dead?\"  My sapient guide  Made sign that he for secret parley wish'd;  Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus  They spake: \"Come thou alone; and let him go  Who hath so hardily enter'd this realm.  Alone return he by his witless way;  If well he know it, let him prove.  For thee,  Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark  Hast been his escort.\" Now bethink thee, reader!  What cheer was mine at sound of those curs'd words.  I did believe I never should return.       \"O my lov'd guide!  who more than seven times  Security hast render'd me, and drawn  From peril deep, whereto I stood expos'd,  Desert me not,\" I cried, \"in this extreme.  And if our onward going be denied,  Together trace we back our steps with speed.\"       My liege, who thither had conducted me,  Replied: \"Fear not:  for of our passage none  Hath power to disappoint us, by such high  Authority permitted.  But do thou  Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit  Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur'd  I will not leave thee in this lower world.\"       This said, departs the sire benevolent,  And quits me.  Hesitating I remain  At war 'twixt will and will not in my thoughts.       I could not hear what terms he offer'd them,  But they conferr'd not long, for all at once  To trial fled within.  Clos'd were the gates  By those our adversaries on the breast  Of my liege lord:  excluded he return'd  To me with tardy steps.  Upon the ground  His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras'd  All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:  \"Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?\"  Then thus to me: \"That I am anger'd, think  No ground of terror:  in this trial I  Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within  For hindrance.  This their insolence, not new,  Erewhile at gate less secret they display'd,  Which still is without bolt; upon its arch  Thou saw'st the deadly scroll:  and even now  On this side of its entrance, down the steep,  Passing the circles, unescorted, comes  One whose strong might can open us this land.\"        CANTO IX    THE hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks  Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,  Chas'd that from his which newly they had worn,  And inwardly restrain'd it.  He, as one  Who listens, stood attentive:  for his eye  Not far could lead him through the sable air,  And the thick-gath'ring cloud.  \"It yet behooves  We win this fight\"--thus he began--\" if not--  Such aid to us is offer'd. --Oh, how long  Me seems it, ere the promis'd help arrive!\"       I noted, how the sequel of his words  Clok'd their beginning; for the last he spake  Agreed not with the first.  But not the less  My fear was at his saying; sith I drew  To import worse perchance, than that he held,  His mutilated speech.  \"Doth ever any  Into this rueful concave's extreme depth  Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain  Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?\"       Thus I inquiring. \"Rarely,\" he replied,  \"It chances, that among us any makes  This journey, which I wend.  Erewhile 'tis true  Once came I here beneath, conjur'd by fell  Erictho, sorceress, who compell'd the shades  Back to their bodies.

'Now and then, since the day  the traders had first bought him and put him into sledge-traces away  over on the Mackenzie, he had often thought of this freedom longingly,  the wolf blood in him urging him to take it. But he had never quite  dared. It thrilled him now. There were no clubs here, no whips, none of  the man-beasts whom he had first learned to distrust, and then to hate.  It was his misfortune--that quarter-strain of wolf; and the clubs,  instead of subduing him, had added to the savagery that was born in him.  Men had been his worst enemies. They had beaten him time and again until  he was almost dead. They called him \"bad,\" and stepped wide of him, and  never missed the chance to snap a whip over his back. His body was  covered with scars they had given him.    He had never felt kindness, or love, until the first night the woman had  put her warm little hand on his head, and had snuggled her face close  down to his, while Thorpe--her husband--had cried out in horror. He had  almost buried his fangs in her white flesh, but in an instant her gentle  touch, and her sweet voice, had sent through him that wonderful thrill  that was his first knowledge of love. And now it was a man who was  driving him from her, away from the hand that had never held a club or a  whip, and he growled as he trotted deeper into the forest.    He came to the edge of a swamp as day broke. For a time he had been  filled with a strange uneasiness, and light did not quite dispel it. At  last he was free of men. He could detect nothing that reminded him of  their hated presence in the air. But neither could he smell the presence  of other dogs, of the sledge, the fire, of companionship and food, and  so far back as he could remember they had always been a part of his  life.    Here it was very quiet. The swamp lay in a hollow between two  ridge-mountains, and the spruce and cedar grew low and thick--so thick  that there was almost no snow under them, and day was like twilight. Two  things he began to miss more than all others--food and company. Both the  wolf and the dog that was in him demanded the first, and that part of  him that was dog longed for the latter. To both desires the wolf blood  that was strong in him rose responsively. It told him that somewhere in  this silent world between the two ridges there was companionship, and  that all he had to do to find it was to sit back on his haunches, and  cry out his loneliness. More than once something trembled in his deep  chest, rose in his throat, and ended there in a whine. It was the wolf  howl, not yet quite born.    Food came more easily than voice. Toward midday he cornered a big white  rabbit under a log, and killed it. The warm flesh and blood was better  than frozen fish, or tallow and bran, and the feast he had gave him  confidence. That afternoon he chased many rabbits, and killed two more.  Until now, he had never known the delight of pursuing and killing at  will, even though he did not eat all he killed.    But there was no fight in the rabbits. They died too easily. They were  very sweet and tender to eat, when he was hungry, but the first thrill  of killing them passed away after a time. He wanted something bigger. He  no longer slunk along as if he were afraid, or as if he wanted to remain  hidden. He held his head up. His back bristled. His tail swung free and  bushy, like a wolf's. Every hair in his body quivered with the electric  energy of life and action. He traveled north and west. It was the call  of early days--the days away up on the Mackenzie. The Mackenzie was a  thousand miles away.    He came upon many trails in the snow that day, and sniffed the scents  left by the hoofs of moose and caribou, and the fur-padded feet of a  lynx. He followed a fox, and the trail led him to a place shut in by  tall spruce, where the snow was beaten down and reddened with blood.  There was an owl's head, feathers, wings and entrails lying here, and he  knew that there were other hunters abroad besides himself.    Toward evening he came upon tracks in the snow that were very much like  his own. They were quite fresh, and there was a warm scent about them  that made him whine, and filled him again with that desire to fall back  upon his haunches and send forth the wolf-cry. This desire grew stronger  in him as the shadows of night deepened in the forest. He had traveled  all day, but he was not tired. There was something about night, now that  there were no men near, that exhilarated him strangely. The wolf blood  in him ran swifter and swifter. To-night it was clear. The sky was  filled with stars. The moon rose. And at last he settled back in the  snow and turned his head straight up to the spruce-tops, and the wolf  came out of him in a long mournful cry which quivered through the still  night for miles.    For a long time he sat and listened after that howl. He had found  voice--a voice with a strange new note in it, and it gave him still  greater confidence. He had expected an answer, but none came. He had  traveled in the face of the wind, and as he howled, a bull moose crashed  through the scrub timber ahead of him, his horns rattling against the  trees like the tattoo of a clear birch club as he put distance between  himself and that cry.    Twice Kazan howled before he went on, and he found joy in the practise  of that new note. He came then to the foot of a rough ridge, and turned  up out of the swamp to the top of it. The stars and the moon were nearer  to him there, and on the other side of the ridge he looked down upon a  great sweeping plain, with a frozen lake glistening in the moonlight,  and a white river leading from it off into timber that was neither so  thick nor so black as that in the swamp.    And then every muscle in his body grew tense, and his blood leaped. From  far off in the plain there came a cry. It was _his_ cry--the wolf-cry.  His jaws snapped. His white fangs gleamed, and he growled deep in his  throat. He wanted to reply, but some strange instinct urged him not to.  That instinct of the wild was already becoming master of him. In the  air, in the whispering of the spruce-tops, in the moon and the stars  themselves, there breathed a spirit which told him that what he had  heard was the wolf-cry, but that it was not the wolf _call_.    The other came an hour later, clear and distinct, that same wailing howl  at the beginning--but ending in a staccato of quick sharp yelps that  stirred his blood at once into a fiery excitement that it had never  known before. The same instinct told him that this was the call--the  hunt-cry. It urged him to come quickly. A few moments later it came  again, and this time there was a reply from close down along the foot of  the ridge, and another from so far away that Kazan could scarcely hear  it. The hunt-pack was gathering for the night chase; but Kazan sat quiet  and trembling.    He was not afraid, but he was not ready to go. The ridge seemed to split  the world for him. Down there it was new, and strange, and without men.  From the other side something seemed pulling him back, and suddenly he  turned his head and gazed back through the moonlit space behind him, and  whined. It was the dog-whine now. The woman was back there. He could  hear her voice. He could feel the touch of her soft hand. He could see  the laughter in her face and eyes, the laughter that had made him warm  and happy. She was calling to him through the forests, and he was torn  between desire to answer that call, and desire to go down into the  plain. For he could also see many men waiting for him with clubs, and he  could hear the cracking of whips, and feel the sting of their lashes.    For a long time he remained on the top of the ridge that divided his  world. And then, at last, he turned and went down into the plain.    All that night he kept close to the hunt-pack, but never quite  approached it. This was fortunate for him. He still bore the scent of  traces, and of man. The pack would have torn him into pieces. The first  instinct of the wild is that of self-preservation. It may have been  this, a whisper back through the years of savage forebears, that made  Kazan roll in the snow now and then where the feet of the pack had trod  the thickest.    That night the pack killed a caribou on the edge of the lake, and  feasted until nearly dawn. Kazan hung in the face of the wind. The smell  of blood and of warm flesh tickled his nostrils, and his sharp ears  could catch the cracking of bones. But the instinct was stronger than  the temptation.    Not until broad day, when the pack had scattered far and wide over the  plain, did he go boldly to the scene of the kill. He found nothing but  an area of blood-reddened snow, covered with bones, entrails and torn  bits of tough hide. But it was enough, and he rolled in it, and buried  his nose in what was left, and remained all that day close to it,  saturating himself with the scent of it.    That night, when the moon and the stars came out again, he sat back with  fear and hesitation no longer in him, and announced himself to his new  comrades of the great plain.    The pack hunted again that night, or else it was a new pack that started  miles to the south, and came up with a doe caribou to the big frozen  lake. The night was almost as clear as day, and from the edge of the  forest Kazan first saw the caribou run out on the lake a third of a mile  away. The pack was about a dozen strong, and had already split into the  fatal horseshoe formation, the two leaders running almost abreast of the  kill, and slowly closing in.    With a sharp yelp Kazan darted out into the moonlight. He was directly  in the path of the fleeing doe, and bore down upon her with lightning  speed. Two hundred yards away the doe saw him, and swerved to the right,  and the leader on that side met her with open jaws. Kazan was in with  the second leader, and leaped at the doe's soft throat."]]]
