[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10743"],[0,"Moonfleet (#5)"],[1," for if it was not the  coffins, what should it be that made the noise?    So on the next day after we heard the sounds in church, being the  Monday, as soon as morning school was over, off I ran down street and  across meadows to the churchyard, meaning to listen outside the church  if the Mohunes were still moving. I say outside the church, for I knew  Ratsey would not lend me the key to go in after what he had said about  boys prying into things that did not concern them; and besides that, I  do not know that I should care to have ventured inside alone, even if I  had the key.    When I reached the church, not a little out of breath, I listened first  on the side nearest the village, that is the north side; putting my ear  against the wall, and afterwards lying down on the ground, though the  grass was long and wet, so that I might the better catch any sound that  came. But I could hear nothing, and so concluded that the Mohunes had  come to rest again, yet thought I would walk round the church and listen  too on the south or sea side, for that their worships might have drifted  over to that side, and be there rubbing shoulders with one another. So I  went round, and was glad to get out of the cold shade into the sun on the  south. But here was a surprise; for when I came round a great buttress  which juts out from the wall, what should I see but two men, and these  two were Ratsey and Elzevir Block. I came upon them unawares, and, lo and  behold, there was Master Ratsey lying also on the ground with his ear to  the wall, while Elzevir sat back against the inside of the buttress with  a spy-glass in his hand, smoking and looking out to sea.    Now, I had as much right to be in the churchyard as Ratsey or Elzevir,  and yet I felt a sudden shame as if I had been caught in some bad act,  and knew the blood was running to my cheeks. At first I had it in my mind  to turn tail and make off, but concluded to stand my ground since they  had seen me, and so bade them 'Good morning'. Master Ratsey jumped to his  feet as nimbly as a cat; and if he had not been a man, I should have  thought he was blushing too, for his face was very red, though that came  perhaps from lying on the ground. I could see he was a little put about,  and out of countenance, though he tried to say 'Good morning, John', in  an easy tone, as if it was a common thing for him to be lying in the  churchyard, with his ear to the wall, on a winter's morning. 'Good  morning, John,' he said; 'and what might you be doing in the churchyard  this fine day?'    I answered that I was come to listen if the Mohunes were still moving.    'Well, that I can't tell you,' returned Ratsey, 'not wishing to waste  thought on such idle matters, and having to examine this wall whether  the floods have not so damaged it as to need under-pinning; so if you  have time to gad about of a morning, get you back to my workshop and  fetch me a plasterer's hammer which I have left behind, so that I can  try this mortar.'    I knew that he was making excuses about underpinning, for the wall was  sound as a rock, but was glad enough to take him at his word and beat a  retreat from where I was not wanted. Indeed, I soon saw how he was  mocking me, for the men did not even wait for me to come back with the  hammer, but I met them returning in the first meadow. Master Ratsey made  another excuse that he did not need the hammer now, as he had found out  that all that was wanted was a little pointing with new mortar. 'But if  you have such time to waste, John,' he added, 'you can come tomorrow and  help me to get new thwarts in the _Petrel_, which she badly wants.'    So we three came back to the village together; but looking up at Elzevir  once while Master Ratsey was making these pretences, I saw his eyes  twinkle under their heavy brows, as if he was amused at the other's  embarrassment.    The next Sunday, when we went to church, all was quiet as usual,  there was no Elzevir, and no more noises, and I never heard the  Mohunes move again.          CHAPTER 3    A DISCOVERY    Some bold adventurers disdain  The limits of their little reign,    And unknown regions dare descry;  Still, as they run, they look behind,  They hear a voice in every wind    And snatch a fearful joy--_Gray_      I have said that I used often in the daytime, when not at school, to go  to the churchyard, because being on a little rise, there was the best  view of the sea to be had from it; and on a fine day you could watch the  French privateers creeping along the cliffs under the Snout, and lying in  wait for an Indiaman or up-channel trader. There were at Moonfleet few  boys of my own age, and none that I cared to make my companion; so I was  given to muse alone, and did so for the most part in the open air, all  the more because my aunt did not like to see an idle boy, with muddy  boots, about her house.    For a few weeks, indeed, after the day that I had surprised Elzevir and  Ratsey, I kept away from the church, fearing to meet them there again;  but a little later resumed my visits, and saw no more of them. Now, my  favourite seat in the churchyard was the flat top of a raised stone tomb,  which stands on the south-east of the church. I have heard Mr. Glennie  call it an altar-tomb, and in its day it had been a fine monument, being  carved round with festoons of fruit and flowers; but had suffered so much  from the weather, that I never was able to read the lettering on it, or  to find out who had been buried beneath. Here I chose most to sit, not  only because it had a flat and convenient top, but because it was  screened from the wind by a thick clump of yew-trees. These yews had  once, I think, completely surrounded it, but had either died or been cut  down on the south side, so that anyone sitting on the grave-top was snug  from the weather, and yet possessed a fine prospect over the sea. On the  other three sides, the yews grew close and thick, embowering the tomb  like the high back of a fireside chair; and many times in autumn I have  seen the stone slab crimson with the fallen waxy berries, and taken some  home to my aunt, who liked to taste them with a glass of sloe-gin after  her Sunday dinner. Others beside me, no doubt, found this tomb a  comfortable seat and look-out; for there was quite a path worn to it on  the south side, though all the times I had visited it I had never seen  anyone there.    So it came about that on a certain afternoon in the beginning of  February, in the year 1758, I was sitting on this tomb looking out to  sea. Though it was so early in the year, the air was soft and warm as a  May day, and so still that I could hear the drumming of turnips that  Gaffer George was flinging into a cart on the hillside, near half a mile  away. Ever since the floods of which I have spoken, the weather had been  open, but with high winds, and little or no rain. Thus as the land dried  after the floods there began to open cracks in the heavy clay soil on  which Moonfleet is built, such as are usually only seen with us in the  height of summer. There were cracks by the side of the path in the  sea-meadows between the village and the church, and cracks in the  churchyard itself, and one running right up to this very tomb.    It must have been past four o'clock in the afternoon, and I was for  returning to tea at my aunt's, when underneath the stone on which I sat I  heard a rumbling and crumbling, and on jumping off saw that the crack in  the ground had still further widened, just where it came up to the tomb,  and that the dry earth had so shrunk and settled that there was a hole  in the ground a foot or more across. Now this hole reached under the big  stone that formed one side of the tomb, and falling on my hands and knees  and looking down it, I perceived that there was under the monument a  larger cavity, into which the hole opened. I believe there never was boy  yet who saw a hole in the ground, or a cave in a hill, or much more an  underground passage, but longed incontinently to be into it and discover  whither it led. So it was with me; and seeing that the earth had fallen  enough into the hole to open a way under the stone, I slipped myself in  feet foremost, dropped down on to a heap of fallen mould, and found that  I could stand upright under the monument itself.    Now this was what I had expected, for I thought that there had been below  this grave a vault, the roof of which had given way and let the earth  fall in. But as soon as my eyes were used to the dimmer light, I saw that  it was no such thing, but that the hole into which I had crept was only  the mouth of a passage, which sloped gently down in the direction of the  church. My heart fell to thumping with eagerness and surprise, for I  thought I had made a wonderful discovery, and that this hidden way would  certainly lead to great things, perhaps even to Blackbeard's hoard; for  ever since Mr. Glennie's tale I had constantly before my eyes a vision of  the diamond and the wealth it was to bring me. The passage was two paces  broad, as high as a tall man, and cut through the soil, without bricks or  any other lining; and what surprised me most was that it did not seem  deserted nor mouldy and cob-webbed, as one would expect such a place to  be, but rather a well-used thoroughfare; for I could see the soft clay  floor was trodden with the prints of many boots, and marked with a trail  as if some heavy thing had been dragged over it.    So I set out down the passage, reaching out my hand before me lest I  should run against anything in the dark, and sliding my feet slowly to  avoid pitfalls in the floor. But before I had gone half a dozen paces,  the darkness grew so black that I was frightened, and so far from going  on was glad to turn sharp about, and see the glimmer of light that came  in through the hole under the tomb. Then a horror of the darkness seized  me, and before I well knew what I was about I found"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10745"],[0,"The Story of the Champions of the Round Table (#5)"],[1,"ers; and his eyes were large and bright and extraordinarily black,  and his eyebrows arched so smoothly that if they had been painted they  could not have been marked upon his forehead more evenly than they were;  and his lips, which pouted a little, though not very much, were as red as  coral, and his upper lip was shaded with a soft down of black. Moreover,  this youth was clad altogether in white cloth of satin with no ornaments  whatsoever saving only a fine chain of shining silver set with opal-stones  and emeralds that hung about his neck.    Then when King Arthur approached near enough he perceived by certain signs  that the lady was the chiefest of those three, wherefore he paid his court  to her especially, saying to her: \"Lady, it seems that I have been brought  hitherward unto you and that you were aware of my name and estate when you  sent for me. Now I should be exceedingly glad if you would enlighten me in  the same manner as to yourself.\"    \"Sir,\" she said, \"that I shall be glad to do; for if I have known you  aforetime, you have also seen me afore time and have known me as your  friend.\" Therewith the lady lowered the wimple from her face and King  Arthur perceived that it was the Lady of the Lake.    [Sidenote: King Arthur findeth Sir Pellias again] Upon this he kneeled  down upon one knee and took her hand and set it to his lips. \"Lady,\" quoth  he, \"I have indeed cause to know you very well, for you have, as you  affirm, been a friend to me and to my friends upon many several occasions.\"  Then King Arthur turned to that knight who was with that Lady of the Lake,  and he said unto him: \"Messire, if I mistake not, I should know you also;  and I doubt not, if you will lift the umbril of your helmet, we shall all  three know your face.\" Upon this the knight without more ado lifted his  umbril as King Arthur had desired him to do and the three beheld that it  was Sir Pellias, the Gentle Knight.    Now it hath already been very fully told about Sir Pellias in the Book of  King Arthur, and those of you who read of him therein will remember, no  doubt, how sorely he was wounded in a combat with Sir Gawaine, who was his  best friend, and of how the Lady of the Lake took him to dwell with her in  that wonderful city that was hidden by the appearance as of an enchanted  lake, and of how it was Sir Gawaine who last beheld him upon that occasion.  But if Sir Gawaine was the dearest friend that Sir Pellias had at that  time, then Sir Ewain was only less dear to him. Therefore, when Sir Ewain  beheld that the strange knight was Sir Pellias, he wist not what to think  for pure wonder; for no mortal eyes had ever beheld Sir Pellias since he  had gone into the lake with the Lady of the Lake that time as foretold, and  it was not thought that anyone would ever see him again.    So when Sir Ewain beheld that the knight was Sir Pellias he emitted a great  cry of joy and ran to him and catched him in his arms, and Sir Pellias  forbade him not. For though at most times those who are of Faery do not  suffer themselves to be touched by mortal hands, yet, upon the Eve of Saint  John's Day, fairies and mortals may commune as though they were of the same  flesh and blood. Wherefore Sir Pellias did not forbid Sir Ewain, and they  embraced, as one-time brethren-in-arms should embrace. And each kissed the  other upon the face, and each made great joy the one over the other. Yea,  so great was their joy that all those who stood about were moved with pure  happiness at beholding them.    Then Sir Pellias came to King Arthur and kneeled down before him and kissed  his hand, as is the bounden duty of every knight unto his lord.    \"Ha, Messire,\" quoth King Arthur, \"methought when I beheld this lady, that  you would not be very far distant from her.\" Then he said unto the Lady of  the Lake: \"Lady, I prithee tell me, who is this fair youth who is with you.  For methinks I never beheld before so noble and so beautiful a countenance  as his. Maybe you will make us acquainted with him also.\"    \"Lord,\" said the Lady Nymue, \"who he is, and of what quality, shall, I  hope, be made manifest in due time; just now I would not wish that he  should be known even unto you. But touching him, I may say that it was for  his sake that I sent my damsel to meet you at the cross-roads awhile ago.  But of that, more anon; for see! the feast is now spread which we have  prepared for your entertainment. So let us first eat and drink and make  merry together, and then we shall speak further of this matter.\"    [Sidenote: The Lady of the Lake prepareth a feast for King Arthur] So they  all six went and sat down to the table that had been spread for them in the  open meadow-land. For the night was very pleasant and warm and a wonderful  full moon shone down upon them with a marvellous lustre, and there was a  pleasant air, soft and warm, from the forest, and, what with the scores of  bright waxen tapers that stood in silver candlesticks upon the table (each  taper sparkling as bright as any star), the night was made all illuminate  like to some singular mid-day. There was set before them a plenty of divers  savory meats and of several excellent wines, some as yellow as gold, and  some as red as carbuncle, and they ate and they drank and they made merry  in the soft moonlight with talk and laughter. Somewhiles they told Sir  Pellias and the lady of all that was toward at court at Camelot;  otherwhiles Sir Pellias and the lady told them such marvellous things  concerning the land in which they two dwelt that it would be hard to  believe that the courts of Heaven could be fairer than the courts of  Fairyland whence they had come.    Then, after the feast was ended, the Lady of the Lake said to King Arthur,  \"Sir, an I have won your favor in any way, there is a certain thing I would  ask of you.\" To the which King Arthur made reply: \"Ask it, Lady, and it  shall be granted thee, no matter what it may be.\" \"Sir,\" said the Lady of  the Lake, \"this is what I would ask of you. I would ask you to look upon  this youth who sits beside me. He is so dear to me that I cannot very well  make you know how dear he is. I have brought him hither from our  dwelling-place for one certain reason; to wit, that you should make him  knight. That is the great favor I would ask of you. To this intent I have  brought armor and all the appurtenances of knighthood; for he is of such  noble lineage that no armor in the world could be too good for him.\"    \"Lady,\" quoth King Arthur, \"I will do what you ask with much pleasure and  gladness. But, touching that armor of which you speak, it is my custom to  provide anyone whom I make a knight with armor of mine own choosing.\"    To this the Lady of the Lake smiled very kindly, saying, \"Lord, I pray you,  let be in this case, for I daresay that the armor which hath been provided  for this youth shall be so altogether worthy of your nobility and of his  future credit that you will be entirely contented with it.\" And with that,  King Arthur was altogether satisfied.    [Sidenote: Of the armor, etc., of Sir Launcelot] And, touching that armor,  the ancient history that speaketh of these matters saith that it was of  such a sort as this that followeth, and that it was brought from that  enchanted court of the lake in this wise; to wit, in the front came two  youths, leading two white mules, and the mules bore two chests studded with  silver bosses. In one chest was the hauberk of that armor and in the other  were the iron boots. These were bright like to silver and were inlaid with  cunningly devised figures, all of pure gold. Next to them came two  esquires, clad in white robes and mounted upon white horses, bearing the  one a silver shield and the other a shining helmet, as of silver--it  likewise being very wonderfully inlaid with figures of pure gold. After  these came two other esquires, the one bearing a sword in a white sheath  embossed with studs of silver (the belt whereof was of silver with facets  of gold) and the other leading a white charger, whose coat was as soft and  as shining as silk. And all the gear and furniture of this horse was of  silver and of white samite embellished with silver. So from this you can  see how nobly that young acolyte was provided with all that beseemed his  future greatness. For, as you may have guessed, this youth was Launcelot,  King Ban's son of Benwick, who shortly became the greatest knight in the  world.    [Sidenote: Launcelot guards his armor at night] Now there was in that part  of the forest border a small abbey of monks, and in the chapel of that  abbey Launcelot watched his armor for that night and Sir Ewain was with him  for all that time. Meantime King Arthur and Sir Ector de Maris slept each  in a silken pavilion provided for them by the Lady of the Lake.    In the morning Sir Ewain took Launcelot to the bath and bathed him, for  such was the custom of those who were being prepared for knighthood.    Now, whilst Sir Ewain was bathing the youth, he beheld that on his shoulder  was a mark in the likeness of a golden star and he marvelled very much  thereat; but he made no mention of it at that time, but held his peace  concerning what he saw; only he marvelled very greatly thereat.    [Sidenote: King Arthur creates Sir Launcelot a Knight-Royal] Then, after  Sir Ewain had bathed Launcelot, he clothed him in raiment fitted for that  ceremony unto which he was ordained, and when the youth was so clothed, Sir  Ewain brought him to King Arthur, and King Arthur knighted Launcelot with  great ceremony, and buckled the belt around him with his own hands. After  he had done this Sir Ewain and Sir Ector de Maris set the golden spurs to  his heels, and Sir Ector wist not that he was performing such office for  his own brother.    So Sir Launcelot was made knight with great estate and ceremony, whereof I  have told you all, unto every particular. For it is fitting that all things  should be so"]]]
