Be off with you, Mr. Donnegan!\"    He inserted his foot in the closing crack of the door.    \"Tell me where I'm to go?\" he persisted.    At this her voice rose in pitch, with squeaky rage.    \"I'll raise the house on you!\"    \"Raise 'em. Call down the man of the house. I can talk to him better  than I can to you; but I won't walk off like this. If you can feed me,  I'll pay you for what I eat.\"    A shrill cackling--he could not make out the words. And since patience  was not the first of Donnegan's virtues, he seized on the knob of the  door and deliberately pressed it wide. Standing in the hall, now, and  closing the door slowly behind him, he saw a woman with old, keen eyes  shrinking away toward the staircase. She was evidently in great fear,  but there was something infinitely malicious in the manner in which she  kept working her lips soundlessly. She was shrinking, and half turned  away, yet there was a suggestion that in an instant she might whirl and  fly at his face. The door now clicked, and with the windstorm shut away  Donnegan had a queer feeling of being trapped.    \"Now call the man of the house,\" he repeated. \"See if I can't come to  terms with him.\"    \"He'd make short work of you if he came,\" she replied. She broke into a  shrill laughter, and Donnegan thought he had never seen a face so ugly.  \"If he came,\" she said, \"you'd rue the day.\"    \"Well, I'll talk to you, then. I'm not asking charity. I want to pay for  what I get.\"    \"This ain't a hotel. You go on down the road. Inside eight miles you'll  come to the town.\"    \"Eight miles!\"    \"That's nothing for a man to ride.\"    \"Not at all, if I had something to ride.\"    \"You ain't got a horse?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then how do you come here?\"    \"I walked.\"    If this sharpened her suspicions, it sharpened her fear also. She put  one foot on the lowest step of the stairs.    \"Be off with you, Mr. Donnegally, or whatever your outlandish name is.  You'll get nothing here. What brings you--\"    A door closed and a footstep sounded lightly on the floor above. And  Donnegan, already alert in the strange atmosphere of this house, gave  back a pace so as to get an honest wall behind him. He noted that the  step was quick and small, and preparing himself to meet a wisp of  manhood--which, for that matter, was the type he was most inclined to  fear--Donnegan kept a corner glance upon the old woman at the foot of  the stairs and steadily surveyed the shadows at the head of the rise.    Out of that darkness a foot slipped; not even a boy's foot--a very  child's. The shock of it made Donnegan relax his caution for an instant,  and in that instant she came into the reach of the light. It was a  wretched light at best, for it came from a lamp with smoky chimney  which the old hag carried, and at the raising and lowering of her hand  the flame jumped and died in the throat of the chimney and set the hall  awash with shadows. Falling away to a point of yellow, the lamp allowed  the hall to assume a certain indefinite dignity of height and breadth  and calm proportions; but when the flame rose Donnegan could see the  broken balusters of the balustrade, the carpet, faded past any design  and worn to rattiness, wall paper which had rotted or dried away and  hung in crisp tatters here and there, and on the ceiling an irregular  patch from which the plaster had fallen and exposed the lathwork. But at  the coming of the girl the old woman had turned, and as she did the  flame tossed up in the lamp and Donnegan could see the newcomer  distinctly.    Once before his heart had risen as it rose now. It had been the fag end  of a long party, and Donnegan, rousing from a drunken sleep, staggered  to the window. Leaning there to get the freshness of the night air  against his hot face, he had looked up, and saw the white face of the  moon going up the sky; and a sudden sense of the blackness and loathing  against the city had come upon Donnegan, and the murky color of his own  life; and when he turned away from the window he was sober. And so it  was that he now stared up at the girl. At her breast she held a cloak  together with one hand and the other hand touched the railing of the  stairs. He saw one foot suspended for the next step, as though the sight  of him kept her back in fear. To the miserable soul of Donnegan she  seemed all that was lovely, young, and pure; and her hair, old gold in  the shadow and pale gold where the lamp struck it, was to Donnegan like  a miraculous light about her face.    Indeed, that little pause was a great and awful moment. For considering  that Donnegan, who had gone through his whole life with his eyes ready  either to mock or hate, and who had rarely used his hand except to make  a fist of it; Donnegan who had never, so far as is known, had a  companion; who had asked the world for action, not kindness; this  Donnegan now stood straight with his back against the wall, and poured  out the story of his wayward life to a mere slip of a girl.          6      Even the old woman, whose eyes were sharpened by her habit of looking  constantly for the weaknesses and vices of men, could not guess what was  going on behind the thin, rather ugly face of Donnegan; the girl,  perhaps, may have seen more. For she caught the glitter of his active  eyes even at that distance. The hag began to explain with vicious  gestures that set the light flaring up and down.    \"He ain't come from nowhere, Lou,\" she said. \"He ain't going nowhere; he  wants to stay here for the night.\"    The foot which had been suspended to take the next step was now  withdrawn. Donnegan, remembered at last, whipped off his cap, and at  once the light flared and burned upon his hair. It was a wonderful red;  it shone, and it had a terrible blood tinge so that his face seemed pale  beneath it. There were three things that made up the peculiar dominance  of Donnegan's countenance. The three things were the hair, the uneasy,  bright eyes, and the rather thin, compressed lips. When Donnegan slept  he seemed about to waken from a vigorous dream; when he sat down he  seemed about to leap to his feet; and when he was standing he gave that  impression of a poise which is ready for anything. It was no wonder that  the girl, seeing that face and that alert, aggressive body, shrank a  little on the stairs. Donnegan, that instant, knew that these two women  were really alone in the house as far as fighting men were concerned.    And the fact disturbed him more than a leveled gun would have done. He  went to the foot of the stairs, even past the old woman, and, raising  his head, he spoke to the girl.    \"My name's Donnegan. I came over from the railroad--walked. I don't want  to walk that other eight miles unless there's a real need for it. I--\"  Why did he pause? \"I'll pay for anything I get here.\"    His voice was not too certain; behind his teeth there was knocking a  desire to cry out to her the truth. \"I am Donnegan. Donnegan the tramp.  Donnegan the shiftless. Donnegan the fighter. Donnegan the killer.  Donnegan the penniless, worthless. But for heaven's sake let me stay  until morning and let me look at you--from a distance!\"    But, after all, perhaps he did not need to say all these things. His  clothes were rags, upon his face there was a stubble of unshaven red,  which made the pallor about his eyes more pronounced. If the girl had  been half blind she must have felt that here was a man of fire. He saw  her gather the wrap a little closer about her shoulders, and that sign  of fear made him sick at heart.    \"Mr. Donnegan,\" said the girl. \"I am sorry. We cannot take you into the  house. Eight miles--\"    Did she expect to turn a sinner from the gates of heaven with a mere  phrase? He cast out his hand, and she winced as though he had shaken his  fist at her.    \"Are you afraid?\" cried Donnegan.    \"I don't control the house.\"    He paused, not that her reply had baffled him, but the mere pleasure of  hearing her speak accounted for it. It was one of those low, light  voices which are apt to have very little range or volume, and which  break and tremble absurdly under any stress of emotion; and often they  become shrill in a higher register; but inside conversational limits, if  such a term may be used, there is no fiber so delightful, so purely  musical. Suppose the word \"velvet\" applied to a sound. That voice came  soothingly and delightfully upon the ear of Donnegan, from which the  roar and rattle of the empty freight train had not quite departed. He  smiled at her.    \"But,\" he protested, \"this is west of the Rockies--and I don't see any  other way out.\"    The girl, all this time, was studying him intently, a little sadly, he  thought. Now she shook her head, but there was more warmth in her voice.    \"I'm sorry. I can't ask you to stay without first consulting my father.\"    \"Go ahead. Ask him.\"    She raised her hand a little; the thought seemed to bring her to the  verge of trembling, as though he were asking a sacrilege.    \"Why not?\" he urged.    She did not answer, but, instead, her eyes sought the old, woman, as if  to gain her interposition; she burst instantly into speech.    \"Which there's no good talking any more,\" declared the ancient vixen.  \"Are you wanting to make trouble for her with the colonel? Be off, young  man. It ain't the first time I've told you you'd get nowhere in this  house!\"    There was no possible answer left to Donnegan, and he did as usual the  surprising thing. He broke into laughter of such clear and ringing  tone--such infectious laughter--that the old woman blinked in the midst  of her wrath as though she were seeing a new man, and he saw the lips of  the girl parted in wonder.    \"My father is an invalid,\" said the girl. \"And he lives by strict rules.  I could not break in on him at this time of the evening.\"    \"If"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1007"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Paradise (#5)"],[1,"blazeth, as sends forth  All beauteous things eternal.  What distils  Immediate thence, no end of being knows,  Bearing its seal immutably impress'd.  Whatever thence immediate falls, is free,  Free wholly, uncontrollable by power  Of each thing new: by such conformity  More grateful to its author, whose bright beams,  Though all partake their shining, yet in those  Are liveliest, which resemble him the most.  These tokens of pre-eminence on man  Largely bestow'd, if any of them fail,  He needs must forfeit his nobility,  No longer stainless.  Sin alone is that,  Which doth disfranchise him, and make unlike  To the chief good; for that its light in him  Is darken'd.  And to dignity thus lost  Is no return; unless, where guilt makes void,  He for ill pleasure pay with equal pain.  Your nature, which entirely in its seed  Trangress'd, from these distinctions fell, no less  Than from its state in Paradise; nor means  Found of recovery (search all methods out  As strickly as thou may) save one of these,  The only fords were left through which to wade,  Either that God had of his courtesy  Releas'd him merely, or else man himself  For his own folly by himself aton'd.    \"Fix now thine eye, intently as thou canst,  On th' everlasting counsel, and explore,  Instructed by my words, the dread abyss.    \"Man in himself had ever lack'd the means  Of satisfaction, for he could not stoop  Obeying, in humility so low,  As high he, disobeying, thought to soar:  And for this reason he had vainly tried  Out of his own sufficiency to pay  The rigid satisfaction.  Then behooved  That God should by his own ways lead him back  Unto the life, from whence he fell, restor'd:  By both his ways, I mean, or one alone.  But since the deed is ever priz'd the more,  The more the doer's good intent appears,  Goodness celestial, whose broad signature  Is on the universe, of all its ways  To raise ye up, was fain to leave out none,  Nor aught so vast or so magnificent,  Either for him who gave or who receiv'd  Between the last night and the primal day,  Was or can be.  For God more bounty show'd.  Giving himself to make man capable  Of his return to life, than had the terms  Been mere and unconditional release.  And for his justice, every method else  Were all too scant, had not the Son of God  Humbled himself to put on mortal flesh.    \"Now, to fulfil each wish of thine, remains  I somewhat further to thy view unfold.  That thou mayst see as clearly as myself.    \"I see, thou sayst, the air, the fire I see,  The earth and water, and all things of them  Compounded, to corruption turn, and soon  Dissolve.  Yet these were also things create,  Because, if what were told me, had been true  They from corruption had been therefore free.    \"The angels, O my brother! and this clime  Wherein thou art, impassible and pure,  I call created, as indeed they are  In their whole being.  But the elements,  Which thou hast nam'd, and what of them is made,  Are by created virtue' inform'd: create  Their substance, and create the' informing virtue  In these bright stars, that round them circling move  The soul of every brute and of each plant,  The ray and motion of the sacred lights,  With complex potency attract and turn.  But this our life the' eternal good inspires  Immediate, and enamours of itself;  So that our wishes rest for ever here.    \"And hence thou mayst by inference conclude  Our resurrection certain, if thy mind  Consider how the human flesh was fram'd,  When both our parents at the first were made.\"          CANTO VIII    The world was in its day of peril dark  Wont to believe the dotage of fond love  From the fair Cyprian deity, who rolls  In her third epicycle, shed on men  By stream of potent radiance: therefore they  Of elder time, in their old error blind,  Not her alone with sacrifice ador'd  And invocation, but like honours paid  To Cupid and Dione, deem'd of them  Her mother, and her son, him whom they feign'd  To sit in Dido's bosom: and from her,  Whom I have sung preluding, borrow'd they  The appellation of that star, which views,  Now obvious and now averse, the sun.    I was not ware that I was wafted up  Into  its orb; but the new loveliness  That grac'd my lady, gave me ample proof  That we had entered there.  And as in flame  A sparkle is distinct, or voice in voice  Discern'd, when one its even tenour keeps,  The other comes and goes; so in that light  I other luminaries saw, that cours'd  In circling motion, rapid more or less,  As their eternal phases each impels.    Never was blast from vapour charged with cold,  Whether invisible to eye or no,  Descended with such speed, it had not seem'd  To linger in dull tardiness, compar'd  To those celestial lights, that tow'rds us came,  Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring,  Conducted by the lofty seraphim.  And after them, who in the van appear'd,  Such an hosanna sounded, as hath left  Desire, ne'er since extinct in me, to hear  Renew'd the strain.  Then parting from the rest  One near us drew, and sole began: \"We all  Are ready at thy pleasure, well dispos'd  To do thee gentle service.  We are they,  To whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing  'O ye! whose intellectual ministry  Moves the third heaven!' and in one orb we roll,  One motion, one impulse, with those who rule  Princedoms in heaven; yet are of love so full,  That to please thee 't will be as sweet to rest.\"    After mine eyes had with meek reverence  Sought the celestial guide, and were by her  Assur'd, they turn'd again unto the light  Who had so largely promis'd, and with voice  That bare the lively pressure of my zeal,  \"Tell who ye are,\" I cried.  Forthwith it grew  In size and splendour, through augmented joy;  And thus it answer'd: \"A short date below  The world possess'd me.  Had the time been more,  Much evil, that will come, had never chanc'd.  My gladness hides thee from me, which doth shine  Around, and shroud me, as an animal  In its own silk enswath'd.  Thou lov'dst me well,  And had'st good cause; for had my sojourning  Been longer on the earth, the love I bare thee  Had put forth more than blossoms.  The left bank,  That Rhone, when he hath mix'd with Sorga, laves.    \"In me its lord expected, and that horn  Of fair Ausonia, with its boroughs old,  Bari, and Croton, and Gaeta pil'd,  From where the Trento disembogues his waves,  With Verde mingled, to the salt sea-flood.  Already on my temples beam'd the crown,  Which gave me sov'reignty over the land  By Danube wash'd, whenas he strays beyond  The limits of his German shores.  The realm,  Where, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash'd,  Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights,  The beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom  (Not through Typhaeus, but the vap'ry cloud  Bituminous upsteam'd), THAT too did look  To have its scepter wielded by a race  Of monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph;  had not ill lording which doth spirit up  The people ever, in Palermo rais'd  The shout of 'death,' re-echo'd loud and long.  Had but my brother's foresight kenn'd as much,  He had been warier that the greedy want  Of Catalonia might not work his bale.  And truly need there is, that he forecast,  Or other for him, lest more freight be laid  On his already over-laden bark.  Nature in him, from bounty fall'n to thrift,  Would ask the  guard of braver arms, than such  As only care to have their coffers fill'd.\"    \"My liege, it doth enhance the joy thy words  Infuse into me, mighty as it is,  To think my gladness manifest to thee,  As to myself, who own it, when thou lookst  Into the source and limit of all good,  There, where thou markest that which thou dost speak,  Thence priz'd of me the more.  Glad thou hast made me.  Now make intelligent, clearing the doubt  Thy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse,  How bitter can spring up, when sweet is sown.\"    I thus inquiring; he forthwith replied:  \"If I have power to show one truth, soon that  Shall face thee, which thy questioning declares  Behind thee now conceal'd.  The Good, that guides  And blessed makes this realm, which thou dost mount,  Ordains its providence to be the virtue  In these great bodies: nor th' all perfect Mind  Upholds their nature merely, but in them  Their energy to save: for nought, that lies  Within the range of that unerring bow,  But is as level with the destin'd aim,  As ever mark to arrow's point oppos'd.  Were it not thus, these heavens, thou dost visit,  Would their effect so work, it would not be  Art, but destruction; and this may not chance,  If th' intellectual powers, that move these stars,  Fail not, or who, first faulty made them fail.  Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc'd?\"    To whom I thus: \"It is enough: no fear,  I see, lest nature in her part should tire.\"    He straight rejoin'd: \"Say, were it worse for man,  If he liv'd not in fellowship on earth?\"    \"Yea,\" answer'd I; \"nor here a reason needs.\"    \"And may that be, if different estates  Grow not of different duties in your life?  Consult your teacher, and he tells you 'no.\"'    Thus did he come, deducing to this point,  And then concluded: \"For this cause behooves,  The roots, from whence your operations come,  Must differ.  Therefore one is Solon born;  Another, Xerxes; and Melchisidec  A third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage  Cost him his son.  In her circuitous course,  Nature, that is the seal to mortal wax,  Doth well her art, but no distinctions owns  'Twixt one or other household.  Hence befalls  That Esau is so wide of Jacob: hence  Quirinus of so base a father springs,  He dates from Mars his lineage.  Were it not  That providence celestial overrul'd,  Nature, in generation, must the path  Trac'd by the generator, still pursue  Unswervingly.  Thus place I in thy sight  That, which was late behind thee.  But, in sign  Of more affection for thee, 't is my will  Thou wear this corollary.  Nature ever  Finding discordant fortune, like all seed  Out of its proper climate, thrives but ill."]]]
