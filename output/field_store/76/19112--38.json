The late Mr. Locke, of Norbury Park, commissioned one Jenkins, a dealer  in pictures, residing at Rome, to send him any piece of sculpture which  might not exceed fifty guineas. Jenkins sent a head of Minerva, which Mr.  Locke, not liking, returned, paying the carriage, and all other expenses.  Nollekens, who was then also at Rome, having purchased  a trunk of  Minerva for fifty pounds, upon the return of this head, found that its  proportion and character accorded with his torso. This discovery induced  him to accept an offer made by Jenkins of the head itself; and 220  guineas to share the profits. After Nollekens had joined the head and  trunk, or, what is called \"restored it,\" which he did at the expense of  twenty guineas more for stone and labour, it proved a most fortunate hit,  for they sold it for the enormous sum of 1,000 guineas! and it is now at  Newby, in Yorkshire.--_Nollekens and his Times._           *       *       *       *       *      NELSON.      We received the following little anecdote from a letter of a gentleman  now at the head of the medical profession, with which he favoured us  shortly after perusing Salmonia. \"I was (says our friend) at the Naval  Hospital, at Yarmouth, on the morning when Nelson, after the battle of  Copenhagen (having sent the wounded before him,) arrived at the Roads,  and landed on the jutty. The populace soon surrounded him, and the  military were drawn up in the market-place ready to receive him; but  making his way through the crowd, and the dust, and the clamour, he went  straight to the hospital. I went round the wards with him, and was much  interested in observing his demeanour to the sailors; he stopped at every  bed, and to every man he had something kind and cheering to say. At  length, he stopped opposite a bed on which a sailor was lying who had  lost his right arm close to the shoulder-joint, and the following short  dialogue passed between, them:\"--_Nelson_. \"Well, Jack, what's the  matter with you?\"--_Sailor_. \"Lost my right arm, your honour.\"--Nelson  paused, looked down at his own empty sleeve, then at the sailor,  and said playfully, \"Well, Jack, then you and I are spoiled for  fishermen--cheer up, my brave fellow.\" And he passed briskly on to the  next bed; but these few words had a magical effect upon the poor fellow,  for I saw his eyes sparkle with delight as Nelson turned away and pursued  his course through the wards. As this was the only occasion on which I  saw Nelson, I may, possibly, overrate the value of the incident.--_Q.  Rev._           *       *       *       *       *      THE BRITISH ALMANAC.      This work, though only in its second year, is too well known to be  benefited by our recommendation. As a compilation, with occasional  originality, it is one of the best executed labours of the Society from  whom it emanates, and who, from the multiplicity of facts here assembled,  may be called \"The Society for the\" _Condensation_ \"of Useful  Knowledge.\"    In the Almanac for 1829 we notice several improvements upon that of last  year. The \"Remarks on Weather\" are valuable; and the \"Garden Plants in  Flower\" in each month, in themselves extremely interesting, contrast the  unchanging course of nature with the grand revolutions and events of the  column of \"Anniversaries.\" Thus, what different emotions are produced by  reading April 6, \"First Abdication of Bonaparte, 1814,\" and \"Primrose  Peerless (_Narcissus biflorus_) in flower.\" The \"Useful Remarks,\"  though not a new feature in an almanac, are profitable helps to social  duties, especially when drawn from such a source as Owen Feltham's  Resolves--a golden treasury of world-knowledge, which may serve as a  text-book for every family. Among the useful facts we notice the  following:--\"By a parliamentary return of the year 1828 we find that the  stamp duty paid upon the almanacs of England amounts to 30,136_l_. 3_s_.  9_d_.--which, the duty being _fifteen-pence_ upon each almanac, exhibits  a circulation of 451,593 annually.\"    _Remarks on Weather._    \"The mean temperature of London is about 2 deg. higher than that of the  surrounding country; the difference exists chiefly in the night, and is  greatest in winter and least in summer.\"    \"Mr. Howard is of opinion, from a careful comparison of a long series of  observations, that a wet spring is an indication of a dry time for the  ensuing harvest.\"    \"The greatest depression of temperature in every month happens, all  other circumstances being the same, a short time before sun-rise.\"    \"There are only two months, namely, July and August, in which, taking  into consideration the power of radiation, vegetation, in certain  situations, is not exposed to a temperature of 32 deg.\"    \"The temperature of August is but little reduced, owing to the prevalence  of hot nights. The action of the sun's rays is considerably assisted by  the warm earth which radiates heat into the air; while, in spring, it  absorbs every day a proportion of the heat which the sun produces.\"    \"_October_--Now that the fruits of the earth are laid in store, the  increase of wet is attended by no injurious effects, the remaining heat  of the earth is preserved from needless expenditure, and guarded from  dissipation, by an increasing canopy of clouds, by which the effect of  radiation is greatly reduced.\"    \"The comparative warmth of November is owing to the heat given out by  the condensation of the vapour in the atmosphere into rain.\"    \"The mean temperature of the whole year is not found to vary, in  different years, more than four degrees and a half.\"           *       *       *       *       *      Such as hold superstition sweet to the soul, and love to exercise their  ingenuity in hieroglyphics, the baseless grounds of tea, and lucky dreams  and omens, will find little amusement in the British Almanac; but their  absence is more than supplied by information \"which almost every man  engaged in the world requires.\"           *       *       *       *       *          THE SKETCH BOOK.           *       *       *       *       *      A VISION OF PURGATORY.    _By William Maginn, Esq._      The churchyard of Inistubber is as lonely a one as you would wish to see  on a summer's day, or avoid on a winter's night. Under the east window of  the church is a mouldering vault of the De Lacys,--a branch of a family  descended from one of the conquerors of Ireland; and there they are  buried, when the allotted time calls them to the tomb. Sir Theodore De  Lacy had lived a jolly, thoughtless life, rising early for the hunt, and  retiring late from the bottle. A good-humoured bachelor who took no care  about the management of his household, provided that the hounds were in  order for his going out, and the table ready on his coming in. As for the  rest,--an easy landlord, a quiet master, a lenient magistrate (except to  poachers,) and a very excellent foreman of a grand jury. He died one  evening while laughing at a story which he had heard regularly thrice a  week for the last fifteen years of his life, and his spirit mingled with  the claret. In former times when the De Lacys were buried, there was a  grand breakfast, and all the party rode over to the church to see the  last rites paid. The keeners lamented; the country people had a wake  before the funeral, and a dinner after it--and there was an end. But  with the march of mind comes trouble and vexation. A man has now-a-days  no certainty of quietness in his coffin--unless it be a patent one. He is  laid down in the grave, and the next morning finds himself called upon to  demonstrate an interesting fact! No one, I believe, admires this ceremony,  and it is not to be wondered at that Sir Theodore De Lacy held it in  especial horror. \"I'd like,\" said he one evening, \"to catch one of the  thieves coming after me when I'm dead--By the God of War, I'd break every  bone in his body;--but,\" he added with a sigh, \"as I suppose I'll not be  able to take my own part then, upon you I leave it, Larry Sweeney, to  watch me three days and three nights after they plant me under the sod.  There's Doctor Dickenson there, I see the fellow looking at me--fill your  glass, Doctor--here's your health! and shoot him, Larry, do you hear,  shoot the Doctor like a cock, if he ever comes stirring up my poor old  bones from their roost of Inistubber.\" \"Why, then,\" Larry answered,  accepting the glass which followed this command, \"long life to both your  honours; and it's I that would like to be putting a bullet into Doctor  Dickenson--heaven between him and harm--for hauling your honour away,  as if you was a horse's head, to a bonfire. There's nothing, I 'shure you,  gintlemin, poor as I am, that would give me greater pleasure.\" \"We feel  obliged, Larry\" said Sir Theodore, \"for your good wishes.\" \"Is it I pull  you out of the grave, indeed!\" continued the whipper-in, for such he was,  --\"I'd let nobody pull your honour out of any place, saving 'twas  purgatory; and out of that I'd pull you myself, if I saw you going  _there_.\" \"I am of opinion, Larry,\" said Doctor Dickenson, \"you would  turn tail if you saw Sir Theodore on that road. You might go further, and  fare worse, you know.\" \"Turn tail!\" replied Larry, \"it is I that  wouldn't--I appale to St. Patrick himself over beyond\"--pointing to a  picture of the Prime Saint of Ireland, which hung in gilt daubery behind  his master's chair, right opposite to him. To Larry's horror and  astonishment, the picture fixing its eyes upon him, winked with the most  knowing air, as if acknowledging the appeal. \"What makes you turn so  white then at the very thought,\" said the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11406"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

The first of the _prose_ is a  Strange Story of every day, by William Kennedy--well told, but too long  for extract. The Mountain Daisy, a village sketch, by the Editor's lady,  is gracefully written; and with the Fisherman, by the Editor, is a fair  characteristic of the amiable spirit to which we have already alluded;  and in the same tone of good feeling is the Rose of Fennock Dale, a true  story by the fair authoress of the Mountain Daisy; and the Wandering  Minstrels, by the Rev. F.A. Cox, L.L.D. Miss Mitford has contributed one  of her inimitable sketches, Little Moses; but the most staple articles  in the volume are The Battle of Bunaania, one of the Georgian Islands,  by Mr. Ellis, the missionary; Notices of the Canadian Indians, by Dr.  Walsh; a Journey over the Brocken, by Mr. Coleridge; and a Fragment, by  Miss Jane Porter.

While in the north of Europe, I met with a rather extraordinary person,  whose account of himself might afford a subject for a pretty romance; a  sort of new Paul and Virginia; but with what different catastrophe, it  is not fair to presage. He described himself as a Frenchman, a native of  Bourdeaux; where, at an early age, he was put on board a merchant ship,  to learn the profession of a seaman. About that time war broke out  between Great Britain, and the lately proclaimed Republic of France;  and the vessel he was in, being attacked, and taken by an English  man-of-war, he was carried a prisoner into England. When there, his  naturally enterprising character would not submit itself to a state of  captivity; and, soon making his wishes understood, he entered on board a  British sloop, bound to New Holland. While gazing with rapt astonishment  on the seeming new heavens which canopied that, to him, also, new  portion of the globe; while the stars of the Cross were exciting his  youthful wonder; and he could no where find the constellations of the  Great, or Little Bear in the midnight firmament, the sky was suddenly  overcast with a cloud, like the pall of nature, and a fearful tempest  burst from it. The scene was dreadful on that wide waste of waters; and  the vessel being driven at last into the rocky labyrinths of the Society  Isles, was finally wrecked on one not many leagues from the celebrated  Otaheite. Laonce, the young Frenchman, and one seaman of the sloop, an  honest north Briton, were the only persons who escaped; for when morning  broke, they found themselves, restored from insensibility, lying on the  shore, and not a trace of the ship, or of those who had navigated her,  was to be discerned. The inhabitants of the island, apparently wild  savages by their almost naked state, instead of seizing them as a prey,  took them to their huts, fed, and cherished them. Hope for awhile  flattered them that some other vessel, bound for New Holland, might also  be driven upon those islands, though not with the same hard fate, and  that by her means they might be released, and conveyed back to Europe.  But days, and weeks, and months, wearing away without any such arrival,  they began to regard the expectation less, and to turn their minds to  take a more intimate interest in objects around them. Time, indeed,  accustomed them to what might be called barbarous, in the manners of the  people; by degrees, even themselves laid aside their European habits;  they exchanged their clothing for the half-exposed fashion of the native  chiefs; and, adopting their pursuits and pleasures, became hunters, and  bold fishers in the light canoe. Finally, they learnt to speak the  language, as if they had been born in the island; and, at length, sealed  their insular destiny by marrying native women. Laonce was hardly  eighteen when he was first cast ashore amongst them; but having a  handsome person, and those engaging manners, from a naturally amiable  disposition added to a gentleman's breeding, which never fail agreeably  impressing even the rudest minds, the eye of female tenderness soon  found him out; and the maiden, being the daughter of the king, and  beautiful withal, had only to hint her wishes to her royal sire; and the  king naming them to their distinguished object, she immediately became  his happy bride. Laonce, becoming thus royally allied, and in the line  of the throne, instantly received publicly the investiture of the  highest order of Otaheitan nobility, namely, a species of tattooing  appropriated to chiefs alone. The limbs of the body thus distinguished,  are traversed all over with a damasked sort of pattern, while the  particular royal insignia is marked on the left side of the forehead,  and below the eye, like a thick mass of dark tattooing.    But the young Frenchman, and his north Briton companion, had reserved to  themselves means of increasing their consequence, still more than by  their mere personal merits, with their new fellow-countrymen. A few days  after the wreck, the subsiding elements had cast up certain articles of  the ship, which they managed to turn to good account: the most valuable  of them were fire-arms and some gunpowder, and a few other implements,  both of defence, and use in household, or ship's repairs. The fire-arms  seemed to endow the new young chief, just engrafted into the reigning  stock, with a kind of preternatural authority; and, by the aid of his  old messmate, and new bosom-coadjutor, he exerted all his influence over  their awed minds, to prevent their recurrence to the frightful practice  he had seen on his first landing, of devouring the prisoners they took  in war. His marriage had invested him with the power of a natively born  son of the king; and, having made himself master of their language, his  persuasions were so conclusive with the leading warriors, that, in the  course of a very little time, it was rare to hear that so dreadful a  species of vengeance was ever tasted, even in stealth. However, so  addicted were some few of the fiercer sort, to this ancient triumph of  their ancestors, that he found it necessary to add commands to  persuasions, and then threats to commands; and having expressed in the  strongest terms his abhorrence of so cowardly and brutal a practice, he  told them, that the first man he saw attempt to touch the flesh of a  prisoner to devour it, he would instantly put the offender to death.    Shortly after this warning, a fray took place between the natives of his  father-in-law's dominions, and their enemies from a hostile island. A  number of captives were taken; and all under his command held his former  orders in such reverence, that none, excepting two (and they had before  shown refractory dispositions,) presumed to disobey his edict of mercy.  But these men, in derision of his lenity, particularly to the female  sex, selected a woman prisoner to be their victim; and slaying her, as  they would have done a beast, they commenced their horrible repast upon  her body. Laonce descried the scene at a distance just as they had  prepared their hideous banquet, and, going resolutely towards them,  levelled his musket at the cannibals. One of the wretches was killed  with the horrid morsel in his mouth, and a second shot, brought down his  voracious accomplice in the act. This bold example so awed all within  ken of the fact, that from that hour, until the day he quitted the  island, a period of fourteen years, no captive ever met with the  interdicted fate. Though the old sovereign continued in life, he  consigned the power to his new son, and Laonce became virtually king of  the place. Indeed, so reconciled was he and his friend the north Briton  (who also married) to the spot which had first sheltered them, and then  adopted them even as its legitimate offspring, that although many ships  of different nations touched there, no inducements could prevail on them  to quit their sea-girt home of simple nature, for all the blandishments  which civilized life could produce. Yet Laonce took a hospitable delight  in showing every act of friendship in his power to the captains of the  vessels; refitting them with food and fresh water; and rendering them  much essential service, in pointing out how to manage with safety the  difficult navigation round the several islands.    The animation with which he recited these circumstances, after he was  far from the spot where they took place, strongly portrayed the fearless  independence of his former life. He spoke with the decision of one whose  commands had been unappealable, and all the barbarian chief lightened in  his eyes. But when he recalled his home there, his family happiness, his  countenance fell, his eyes clouded, and he spoke in half-stifled words.  He described his palace-hut; his arms, his hunting spear, his canoe; his  return to his hut, with the fruits of the chase; the graceful, delicate  person of his wife; her clinging fondness on his entrance; his  tenderness for her, and for his children--for she bore to him a son and  a daughter; and, while he spoke, he burst into tears, and sobbed like a  child. \"I was then beloved,\" said he, \"Honoured!--master of all around  me; Now, I am nothing:--no home--no wife--no friend! I am an outcast  here!--when there! Oh, Berea! wilt thou have forgotten "]]]
