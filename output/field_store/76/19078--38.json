Thus Nehemoth passes on  through the other Audience Chambers and receives, perhaps, some  Sheikhs of the Arab folk who have crossed the great desert from the  West, or receives an embassy sent to do him homage from the shy  jungle people to the South.  And all the while the slaves with the  ringing palanquin run westwards, following the sun, and ever the sun  shines straight into the chamber where Nehemoth sits, and all the  while the music from one or other of his bands of musicians comes  tinkling to his ears.  But when the middle of the day draws near, the  slaves run to the cool groves that lie along the verandahs on the  northern side of the palace, forsaking the sun, and as the heat  overcomes the genius of the musicians, one by one their hands fall  from their instruments, till at last all melody ceases.  At this  moment Nehemoth falls asleep, and the slaves put the palanquin down  and lie down beside it.  At this hour the city becomes quite still,  and the palace of Nehemoth and the tombs of the Pharaohs of old face  to the sunlight, all alike in silence.  Even the jewellers in the  market-place, selling gems to princes, cease from their bargaining  and cease to sing; for in Babbulkund the vendor of rubies sings the  song of the ruby, and the vendor of sapphires sings the song of the  sapphire, and each stone hath its song, so that a man, by his song,  proclaims and makes known his wares.    'But all these sounds cease at the meridian hour, the jewellers in  the market-place lie down in what shadow they can find, and the  princes go back to the cool places in their palaces, and a great  hush in the gleaming air hangs over Babbulkund.  But in the cool of  the late afternoon, one of the King's musicians will awake from  dreaming of his home and will pass his fingers, perhaps, over the  strings of his harp and, with the music, some memory may arise of  the wind in the glens of the mountains that stand in the Isles of  Song.  Then the musician will wrench great cries out of the soul of  his harp for the sake of the old memory, and his fellows will awake  and all make a song of home, woven of sayings told in the harbour  when the ships came in, and of tales in the cottages about the  people of old time.  One by one the other bands of musicians will  take up the song, and Babbulkund, City of Marvel, will throb with  this marvel anew.  Just now Nehemoth awakes, the slaves leap to their  feet and bear the palanquin to the outer side of the great crescent  palace between the south and the west, to behold the sun again.  The  palanquin, with its ringing bells, goes round once more; the voices  of the jewellers sing again, in the market-place, the song of the  emerald, the song of the sapphire; men talk on the housetops,  beggars wail in the streets, the musicians bend to their work, all  the sounds blend together into one murmur, the voice of Babbulkund  speaking at evening.  Lower and lower sinks the sun, till Nehemoth,  following it, comes with his panting slaves to the great purple  garden of which surely thine own country has its songs, from  wherever thou art come.    'There he alights from his palanquin and goes up to a throne of  ivory set in the garden's midst, facing full westwards, and sits  there alone, long regarding the sunlight until it is quite gone.  At  this hour trouble comes into the face of Nehemoth.  Men have heard  him muttering at the time of sunset: \"Even I too, even I too.\" Thus  do King Nehemoth and the sun make their glorious ambits about  Babbulkund.    'A little later, when the stars come out to envy the beauty of the  City of Marvel, the King walks to another part of the garden and  sits in an alcove of opal all alone by the marge of the sacred lake.  This is the lake whose shores and floors are of glass, which is lit  from beneath by slaves with purple lights and with green lights  intermingling, and is one of the seven wonders of Babbulkund.  Three  of the wonders are in the city's midst and four are at her gates.  There is the lake, of which I tell thee, and the purple garden of  which I have told thee and which is a wonder even to the stars, and  there is Ong Zwarba, of which I shall tell thee also.  And the  wonders at the gates are these.  At the eastern gate Neb.  And at the  northern gate the wonder of the river and the arches, for the River  of Myth, which becomes one with the Waters of Fable in the desert  outside the city, floats under a gate of pure gold, rejoicing, and  under many arches fantastically carven that are one with either  bank.  The marvel at the western gate is the marvel of Annolith and  the dog Voth.  Annolith sits outside the western gate facing towards  the city.  He is higher than any of the towers or palaces, for his  head was carved from the summit of the old hill; he hath two eyes of  sapphire wherewith he regards Babbulkund, and the wonder of the eyes  is that they are today in the same sockets wherein they glowed when  first the world began, only the marble that covered them has been  carven away and the light of day let in and the sight of the envious  stars.  Larger than a lion is the dog Voth beside him; every hair is  carven upon the back of Voth, his war hackles are erected and his  teeth are bared.  All the Nehemoths have worshipped the god Annolith,  but all their people pray to the dog Voth, for the law of the land  is that none but a Nehemoth may worship the god Annolith.  The marvel  at the southern gate is the marvel of the jungle, for he comes with  all his wild untravelled sea of darkness and trees and tigers and  sunward-aspiring orchids right through a marble gate in the city  wall and enters the city, and there widens and holds a space in its  midst of many miles across.  Moreover, he is older than the City of  Marvel, for he dwelt long since in one of the valleys of the  mountain which Nehemoth, first of Pharaohs, carved into Babbulkund.    'Now the opal alcove in which the King sits at evening by the lake  stands at the edge of the jungle, and the climbing orchids of the  jungle have long since crept from their homes through clefts of the  opal alcove, lured by the lights of the lake, and now bloom there  exultingly.  Near to this alcove are the hareems of Nehemoth.    'The King hath four hareems--one for the stalwart women from the  mountains to the north, one for the dark and furtive jungle women,  one for the desert women that have wandering souls and pine in  Babbulkund, and one for the princesses of his own kith, whose brown  cheeks blush with the blood of ancient Pharaohs and who exult with  Babbulkund in her surpassing beauty, and who know nought of the  desert or the jungle or the bleak hills to the north.  Quite  unadorned and clad in simple garments go all the kith of Nehemoth,  for they know well that he grows weary of pomp.  Unadorned all save  one, the Princess Linderith, who weareth Ong Zwarba and the three  lesser gems of the sea.  Such a stone is Ong Zwarba that there are  none like it even in the turban of Nehemoth nor in all the  sanctuaries of the sea.  The same god that made Linderith made long  ago Ong Zwarba; she and Ong Zwarba shine together with one light,  and beside this marvellous stone gleam the three lesser ones of the  sea.    'Now when the King sitteth in his opal alcove by the sacred lake  with the orchids blooming around him all sounds are become still.  The sound of the tramping of the weary slaves as they go round and  round never comes to the surface.  Long since the musicians sleep,  and their hands have fallen dumb upon their instruments, and the  voices in the city have died away.  Perhaps a sigh of one of the  desert women has become half a song, or on a hot night in summer one  of the women of the hills sings softly a song of snow; all night  long in the midst of the purple garden sings one nightingale; all else  is still; the stars that look on Babbulkund arise and set, the  cold unhappy moon drifts lonely through them, the night wears on; at  last the dark figure of Nehemoth, eighty-second of his line, rises  and moves stealthily away.'    The traveller ceased to speak.  For a long time the clear stars,  sisters of Babbulkund, had shone upon him speaking, the desert  wind had arisen and whispered to the sand, and the sand had long  gone secretly to and fro; none of us had moved, none of us had  fallen asleep, not so much from wonder at his tale as from the  thought that we ourselves in two days' time should see that wondrous  city.  Then we wrapped our blankets around us and lay down with our  feet towards the embers of our fire and instantly were asleep, and in  our dreams we multiplied the fame of the City of Marvel.    The sun arose and flamed upon our faces, and all the desert glinted  with its light.  Then we stood up and prepared the morning meal, and,  when we had eaten, the traveller departed.  And we commended his soul  to the god of the land whereto he went, of the land of his home to  the northward, and he commended our souls to the God of the people  of the land wherefrom we had come.  Then a traveller overtook us  going on foot; he wore a brown cloak that was all in rags and he  seemed to have been walking all night, and he walked hurriedly but  appeared weary, so we offered him food and drink, of which he  partook thankfully.  When we asked him where he was going, he  answered 'Babbulkund.' Then we offered him a camel upon which to  ride, for we said, 'We also go to Babbulkund.' But he answered  strangely:    'Nay, pass on before me, for it is a sore thing never to have seen  Babbulkund, having lived while yet she stood.  Pass on before me and  behold her, and then flee away at once, returning northwards.'    Then, though we understood him not, we left him, for he was  insistent, and passed on our journey "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10814"],[0,"Legends, Tales and Poems (#5)"],[1,"xx.]    Thanks to the initiative of Ramon Rodriguez Correa and to the aid of  other friends, most of the scattered tales, legends, and poems of  Becquer were gathered together and published by Fernando Fe, Madrid,  in three small volumes. In the Prologue of the first edition Correa  relates the life of his friend with sympathy and enthusiasm, and it is  from this source that we glean most of the facts that are to be known  regarding the poet's life. The appearance of these volumes caused a  marked effect, and their author was placed by popular edict in the  front rank of contemporary writers.    Becquer may be said to belong to the Romantic School, chief of whose  exponents in Spain were Zorilla and Espronceda. The choice of  mediaeval times as the scene of his stories, their style and  treatment, as well as the personal note and the freedom of his verse,  all stamp him as a Romanticist.    His legends, with one or two exceptions, are genuinely Spanish in  subject, though infused with a tender melancholy that recalls the  northern ballads rather than the writings of his native land. His love  for old ruins and monuments, his archaeological instinct, is evident  in every line. So, too, is his artistic nature, which finds a greater  field for its expression in his prose than in his verse. Add to this a  certain bent toward the mysterious and supernatural, and we have the  principal elements that enter into the composition of these legends,  whose quaint, weird beauty not only manifests the charm that naturally  attaches to popular or folk tales, but is due especially to the way in  which they are told by one who was at once an artist and a poet.    Zorilla has been said to be Becquer's most immediate precursor, in  that he possesses the same instinct for the mysterious. But, as Blanco  Garcia observes, \"Becquer is less ardent than Zorilla, and preferred  the strange traditions in which some unknown supernatural power hovers  to those others, more probable, in which only human passions with  their caprices and outbursts are involved.\"[1] Correa says of his  legends that they \"can compete with the tales of Hoffmann and of  Grimm, and with the ballads of Rueckert and of Uhland,\" and that  \"however fantastic they may be, however imaginary they may appear,  they always contain such a foundation of truth, a thought so real,  that in the midst of their extraordinary form and contexture a fact  appears spontaneously to have taken place or to be able to take place  without the slightest difficulty, if you but analyze the situation of  the personages, the time in which they live, or the circumstances that  surround them.\"[2]      [Footnote 1: _La Literatura Espanola en el Siglo XIX_, Madrid, 1891,    vol. II, p. 275.]      [Footnote 2: Correa, _op. cit._, p. xxx.]    The subtle charm of such legends as _Los Ojos Verdes_, _La Corza  Blanca_, _Maese Perez el Organista_, etc., full of local color as they  are, and of an atmosphere of old Spain, is hard to describe, but none  the less real. One is caught by the music of the prose at the first  lines, enraptured by the weird charm of the story, and held in  breathless interest until the last words die away. If Becquer's phrase  is not always classic, it is, on the other hand, vigorous and  picturesque; and when one reflects upon the difficult conditions under  which his writings were produced, in the confusion of the  printing-office, or hurriedly in a miserable attic to procure food for  the immediate necessities of his little family, and when one likewise  recalls the fact that they were published in final book form only  after the author's death, and without retouching, the wonder grows  that they are written in a style so pleasing and so free from  harshness.    Becquer's prose is doubtless at its best in his letters entitled  _Desde mi Celda_, written, as has been said, from the monastery of  Veruela, in 1864. Read his description of his journey to the ancient  Aragonese town of Tarazona, picturesquely situated on the River  Queiles, of his mule trip over the glorious Moncayo, of the  peacefulness and quiet of the old fortified monastery of Veruela, and  you will surely feel inspired to follow him in his wanderings. Writing  of his life in the seclusion of Veruela, Becquer says: \"Every  afternoon, as the sun is about to set, I sally forth upon the road  that runs in front of the monastery doors to wait for the postman, who  brings me the Madrid newspapers. In front of the archway that gives  entrance to the first inclosure of the abbey stretches a long avenue  of poplars so tall that when their branches are stirred by the evening  breeze their summits touch and form an immense arch of verdure. On  both sides of the road, leaping and tumbling with a pleasant murmur  among the twisted roots of the trees, run two rivulets of crystalline  transparent water, as cold as the blade of a sword and as gleaming as  its edge. The ground, over which float the shadows of the poplars,  mottled with restless spots of light, is covered at intervals with the  thickest and finest of grass, in which grow so many white daisies that  they look at first sight like that rain of petals with which the  fruit-trees carpet the ground on warm April days. On the banks of the  stream, amid the brambles and the reeds, grow wild violets, which,  though well-nigh hidden amongst their creeping leaves, proclaim  themselves afar by their penetrating perfume. And finally, also near  the water and forming as it were a second boundary, can be seen  between the poplar trunks a double row of stocky walnut-trees with  dark, round, compact tops.\" About half way down the avenue stands a  marble cross, which, from its color, is known in the vicinity as the  Black Cross of Veruela. \"Nothing is more somberly beautiful than this  spot. At one end of the road the view is closed by the monastery, with  its pointed arches, its peaked towers, and its imposing battlemented  walls; on the other, the ruins of a little hermitage rise, at the foot  of a hillock bestrewn with blooming thyme and rosemary. There, seated  at the foot of the cross, and holding in my hands a book that I  scarcely ever read and often leave forgotten on the steps of the  cross, I linger for one, two, and sometimes even four hours waiting  for the papers.\" At last the post arrives, and the _Contemporaneo_ is  in his hands. \"As I was present at its birth, and as since its birth I  have lived its feverish and impassioned life, _El Contemporaneo_ is  not for me a common newspaper like the rest, but its columns are  yourselves, my friends, my companions in hope or disappointment, in  failure or triumph, in joy or bitterness. The first impression that I  feel upon receiving it, then, is one of joy, like that experienced  upon opening a letter on whose envelope we recognize a dear familiar  handwriting, or when in a foreign land we grasp the hand of a  compatriot and hear our native tongue again. The peculiar odor of the  damp paper and the printer's ink, that characteristic odor which for a  moment obscures the perfume of the flowers that one breathes here on  every hand, seems to strike the olfactory memory, a strange and keen  memory that unquestionably exists, and it brings back to me a portion  of my former life,--that restlessness, that activity, that feverish  productiveness of journalism. I recall the constant pounding and  creaking of the presses that multiply by thousands the words that we  have just written, and that have come all palpitating from our pens. I  recall the strain of the last hours of publication, when night is  almost over and copy scarce. I recall, in short, those times when day  has surprised us correcting an article or writing a last notice when  we paid not the slightest attention to the poetic beauties of the  dawn. In Madrid, and for us in particular, the sun neither rises nor  sets: we put out or light the lights, and that is the only reason we  notice it.\"    At last he opens the sheet. The news of the clubs or the Cortes  absorbs him until the failing light of the setting sun warns him that,  though he has read but the first columns, it is time to go. \"The  shadows of the mountains fall rapidly, and spread over the plain. The  moon begins to appear in the east like a silver circle gleaming  through the sky, and the avenue of poplars is wrapped in the uncertain  dusk of twilight.... The monastery bell, the only one that still hangs  in its ruined Byzantine tower, begins to call to prayers, and one near  and one afar, some with sharp metallic notes, and some with solemn,  muffled tones, the other bells of the hillside towns reply.... It  seems like a harmony that falls from heaven and rises at the same time  from the earth, becomes confounded, and floats in space, intermingling  with the fading sounds of the dying day and the first sighs of the  newborn night.    \"And now all is silenced,--Madrid, political interests, ardent  struggles, human miseries, passions, disappointments, desires, all is  hushed in that divine music. My soul is now as serene as deep and  silent water. A faith in something greater, in a future though unknown  destiny, beyond this life, a faith in eternity,--in short, an  all-absorbing larger aspiration, overwhelms that petty faith which we  might term personal, that faith in the morrow, that sort of goad that  spurs on irresolute minds, and that is so needful if one must struggle  and exist and accomplish something in this world.\"[1]      [Footnote 1: _Obras_, _vol._ II, pp. 222-229.]    This graceful musing, full in the original of those rich harmonies  that only the Spanish language can express, will serve sufficiently to  give an impression of the series as a whole. The broad but fervent  faith expressed in the last lines indicates a deeply religious and  somewhat mystical nature. This characteristic of Becquer may be  noticed frequently in his writings and no one who reads his works  attentively can "]]]
