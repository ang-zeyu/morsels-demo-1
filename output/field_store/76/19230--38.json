We may  well believe that in this early developed reflex activity we have the  basis of that somewhat more complex ticklishness which appears somewhat  later.    The mental element in tickling is indicated by the fact that even a child,  in whom ticklishness is highly developed, cannot tickle himself; so that  tickling is not a simple reflex. This fact was long ago pointed out by  Erasmus Darwin, and he accounted for it by supposing that voluntary  exertion diminishes the energy of sensation.[11] This explanation is,  however, inadmissible, for, although we cannot easily tickle ourselves by  the contact of the skin with our own fingers, we can do so with the aid of  a foreign body, like a feather. We may perhaps suppose that, as  ticklishness has probably developed under the influence of natural  selection as a method of protection against attack and a warning of the  approach of foreign bodies, its end would be defeated if it involved a  simple reaction to the contact of the organism with itself. This need of  protection it is which involves the necessity of a minimal excitation  producing a maximal effect, though the mechanism whereby this takes place  has caused considerable discussion. We may, it is probable, best account  for it by invoking the summation-irradiation theory of pain-pleasure, the  summation of the stimuli in their course through the nerves, aided by  capillary congestion, leading to irradiation due to anastomoses between  the tactile corpuscles, not to speak of the much wider irradiation which  is possible by means of central nervous connections.        Prof. C.L. Herrick adopts this explanation of the phenomena of      tickling, and rests it, in part, on Dogiel's study of the tactile      corpuscles (\"Psychological Corollaries of Modern Neurological      Discoveries,\" _Journal of Comparative Neurology_, March, 1898).      The following remarks of Prof. A. Allin may also be quoted in      further explanation of the same theory: \"So far as ticklishness      is concerned, a very important factor in the production of this      feeling is undoubtedly that of the summation of stimuli. In a      research of Stirling's, carried on under Ludwig's direction, it      was shown that reflex contractions only occur from repeated      shocks to the nerve-centres--that is, through summation of      successive stimuli. That this result is also due in some degree      to an alternating increase in the sensibility of the various      areas in question from altered supply of blood is reasonably      certain. As a consequence of this summation-process there would      result in many cases and in cases of excessive nervous discharge      the opposite of pleasure, namely: pain. A number of instances      have been recorded of death resulting from tickling, and there is      no reason to doubt the truth of the statement that Simon de      Montfort, during the persecution of the Albigenses, put some of      them to death by tickling the soles of their feet with a feather.      An additional causal factor in the production of tickling may lie      in the nature and structure of the nervous process involved in      perception in general. According to certain histological      researches of recent years we know that between the sense-organs      and the central nervous system there exist closely connected      chains of conductors or neurons, along which an impression      received by a single sensory cell on the periphery is propagated      avalanchelike through an increasing number of neurons until the      brain is reached. If on the periphery a single cell is excited      the avalanchelike process continues until finally hundreds or      thousands of nerve-cells in the cortex are aroused to      considerable activity. Golgi, Ramon y Cajal, Koelliker, Held,      Retzius, and others have demonstrated the histological basis of      this law for vision, hearing, and smell, and we may safely assume      from the phenomena of tickling that the sense of touch is not      lacking in a similar arrangement. May not a suggestion be      offered, with some plausibility, that even in ideal or      representative tickling, where tickling results, say, from      someone pointing a finger at the ticklish places, this      avalanchelike process may be incited from central centres, thus      producing, although in a modified degree, the pleasant phenomena      in question? As to the deepest causal factor, I should say that      tickling is the result of vasomotor shock.\" (A. Allin, \"On      Laughter,\" _Psychological Review_, May, 1903.)    The intellectual element in tickling conies out in its connection with  laughter and the sense of the comic, of which it may be said to constitute  the physical basis. While we are not here concerned with laughter and the  comic sense,--a subject which has lately attracted considerable  attention,--it may be instructive to point out that there is more than an  analogy between laughter and the phenomena of sexual tumescence and  detumescence. The process whereby prolonged tickling, with its nervous  summation and irradiation and accompanying hyperaemia, finds sudden relief  in an explosion of laughter is a real example of tumescence--as it has  been defined in the study in another volume entitled \"An Analysis of the  Sexual Impulse\"--resulting finally in the orgasm of detumescence. The  reality of the connection between the sexual embrace and tickling is  indicated by the fact that in some languages, as in that of the  Fuegians,[12] the same word is applied to both. That ordinary tickling is  not sexual is due to the circumstances of the case and the regions to  which the tickling is applied. If, however, the tickling is applied within  the sexual sphere, then there is a tendency for orgasm to take place  instead of laughter. The connection which, through the phenomena of  tickling, laughter thus bears to the sexual sphere is well indicated, as  Groos has pointed out, by the fact that in sexually-minded people sexual  allusions tend to produce laughter, this being the method by which they  are diverted from the risks of more specifically sexual detumescence.[13]        Reference has been made to the view of Alrutz, according to which      tickling is a milder degree of itching. It is more convenient and      probably more correct to regard itching or pruritus, as it is      termed in its pathological forms, as a distinct sensation, for it      does not arise under precisely the same conditions as tickling      nor is it relieved in the same way. There is interest, however,      in pointing out in this connection that, like tickling, itching      has a real parallelism to the specialized sexual sensations.      Bronson, who has very ably interpreted the sensations of itching      (New York Neurological Society, October 7, 1890; _Medical News_,      February 14, 1903, and summarized in the _British Medical      Journal_, March 7, 1903; and elsewhere), regards it as a      perversion of the sense of touch, a dysaesthesia due to obstructed      nerve-excitation with imperfect conduction of the generated force      into correlated nervous energy. The scratching which relieves      itching directs the nervous energy into freer channels, sometimes      substituting for the pruritus either painful or voluptuous      sensations. Such voluptuous sensations may be regarded as a      generalized aphrodisiac sense comparable to the specialized      sexual orgasm. Bronson refers to the significant fact that      itching occurs so frequently in the sexual region, and states      that sexual neurasthenia is sometimes the only discoverable cause      of genital and anal pruritus. (Cf. discussion on pruritus,      _British Medical Journal_, November 30, 1895.) Gilman, again      (_American Journal of Psychology_, vi, p. 22), considers that      scratching, as well as sneezing, is comparable to coitus.    The sexual embrace has an intimate connection with the phenomena of  ticklishness which could not fail to be recognized. This connection is,  indeed, the basis of Spinoza's famous definition of love,--\"_Amor est  titillatio quaedam concomitante idea causae externae_,\"--a statement which  seems to be reflected in Chamfort's definition of love as \"_l'echange de  deux fantaisies, et le contact de deux epidermes_.\" The sexual act, says  Gowers, is, in fact, a skin reflex.[14] \"The sexual parts,\" Hall and Allin  state, \"have a ticklishness as unique as their function and as keen as  their importance.\" Herrick finds the supreme illustration of the summation  and irradiation theory of tickling in the phenomena of erotic excitement,  and points out that in harmony with this the skin of the sexual region is,  as Dogiel has shown, that portion of the body in which the tactile  corpuscles are most thoroughly and elaborately provided with anastomosing  fibres. It has been pointed out[15] that, when ordinary tactile  sensibility is partially abolished,--especially in hemianaesthesia in the  insane,--some sexual disturbance is specially apt to be found in  association.    In young children, in girls even when they are no longer children, and  occasionally in men, tickling may be a source of acute pleasure, which in  very early life is not sexual, but later tends to become so under  circumstances predisposing to the production of erotic emotion, and  especially when the nervous system is keyed up to a high tone favorable  for the production of the maximum effect of tickling.        \"When young,\" writes a lady aged 28, \"I was extremely fond of      being tickled, and I am to some extent still. Between the ages of      10 and 12 it gave me exquisite pleasure, which I now regard as      sexual in character. I used to bribe my younger sister to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#5)"],[1," her care. She would lie on her bed naked,      with two or three naked children, make them suck her breasts and      press them to every part of her body. Her conduct was discovered      by means of other children who peeped through the keyhole, and      she was placed under Penta for treatment. In this case the loss      of moral and mental inhibition, due probably to troubles of the      climacteric, led to indulgence, under abnormal conditions, in      those primitive contacts which are normally the beginning of      love, and these, supported by the ideal image of the early lover,      constituted a complete and adequate symbol of natural love in a      morbidly perverted individual.

FOOTNOTES:    [1] The term \"erotic symbolism\" has already been employed by Eulenburg  (_Sexuale Neuropathie_, 1895, p. 101). It must be borne in mind that this  term, implying the specific emotion, is much narrower than the term  \"sexual symbolism,\" which may be used to designate a great variety of  ritual and social practices which have played a part in the evolution of  civilization.

The psychology of the  associations of contiguity and resemblance through which erotic symbolism  operates its transference is briefly discussed by Ribot in the _Psychology  of the Emotions_, Part 1, Chapter XII; the early chapters of the same  author's _Logique des Sentiments_ may also be said to deal with the  emotional basis on which erotic symbolism arises.    [4] A number of synonyms for the female pudenda are brought together by  Schurig--cunnus, hortus, concha, navis, fovea, larva, canis, annulus,  focus, cymba, antrum, delta, myrtus, etc.--and he discusses many of them.

The various forms of  fetichism are too intimately associated to permit of any group of them  being violently separated from the others.    [12] This has already been considered as a perversion founded on vision,  in discussing _Sexual Selection in Man_. IV.          II.

Of all forms of erotic symbolism the most frequent is that which idealizes  the foot and the shoe. The phenomena we here encounter are sometimes so  complex and raise so many interesting questions that it is necessary to  discuss them somewhat fully.    It would seem that even for the normal lover the foot is one of the most  attractive parts of the body. Stanley Hall found that among the parts  specified as most admired in the other sex by young men and women who  answered a _questionnaire_ the feet came fourth (after the eyes, hair,  stature and size).[13] Casanova, an acute student and lover of women who  was in no degree a foot fetichist, remarks that all men who share his  interest in women are attracted by their feet; they offer the same  interest, he considers, as the question of the particular edition offers  to the book-lover.[14]        In a report of the results of a _questionnaire_ concerning      children's sense of self, to which over 500 replies were      received, Stanley Hall thus summarizes the main facts ascertained      with reference to the feet: \"A special period of noticing the      feet comes somewhat later than that in which the hands are      discovered to consciousness. Our records afford nearly twice as      many cases for feet as for hands. The former are more remote from      the primary psychic focus or position, and are also more often      covered, so that the sight of them is a more marked and      exceptional event. Some children become greatly excited whenever      their feet are exposed. Some infants show signs of fear at the      movement of their own knees and feet covered, and still more      often fright is the first sensation which signalizes the child's      discovery of its feet.... Many are described as playing with them      as if fascinated by strange, newly-discovered toys. They pick      them up and try to throw them away, or out of the cradle, or      bring them to the mouth, where all things tend to go.... Children      often handle their feet, pat and stroke them, offer them toys and      the bottle, as if they, too, had an independent hunger to      gratify, an _ego_ of their own.... Children often develop [later]      a special interest in the feet of others, and examine, feel them,      etc., sometimes expressing surprise that the pinch of the      mother's toe hurts her and not the child, or comparing their own      and the feet of others point by point. Curious, too, are the      intensifications of foot-consciousness throughout the early years      of childhood, whenever children have the exceptional privilege of      going barefoot, or have new shoes. The feet are often      apostrophized, punished, beaten sometimes to the point of pain      for breaking things, throwing the child down, etc. Several      children have habits, which reach great intensity, and then      vanish, of touching or tickling the feet, with gales of laughter,      and a few are described as showing an almost morbid reluctance to      wear anything upon the feet, or even to having them touched by      others.... Several almost fall in love with the great toe or the      little one, especially admiring some crease or dimple in it,      dressing it in some rag of silk or bit of ribbon, or cut-off      glove fingers, winding it with string, prolonging it by tying on      bits of wood. Stroking the feet of others, especially if they are      shapely, often becomes almost a passion with young children, and      several adults confess a survival of the same impulse which it is      an exquisite pleasure to gratify. The interest of some mothers in      babies' toes, the expressions of which are ecstatic and almost      incredible, is a factor of great importance.\" (G. Stanley Hall,      \"Some Aspects of the Early Sense of Self,\" _American Journal of      Psychology_, April, 1898.) In childhood, Stanley Hall remarks      elsewhere (_Adolescence_, vol. ii, p. 104), \"a form of courtship      may consist solely in touching feet under the desk.\" It would      seem that even animals have a certain amount of sexual      consciousness in the feet; I have noticed a male donkey, just      before coitus, bite the feet of his partner.    At the same time it is scarcely usual for the normal lover, in most  civilized countries to-day, to attach primary importance to the foot, such  as he very frequently attaches to the eyes, though the feet play a very  conspicuous part in the work of certain novelists.[15]    In a small but not inconsiderable minority of persons, however, the foot  or the boot becomes the most attractive part of a woman, and in some  morbid cases the woman herself is regarded as a comparatively unimportant  appendage to her feet or her boots. The boots under civilized conditions  much more frequently constitute the sexual symbol than do the feet  themselves; this is not surprising since in ordinary life the feet are not  often seen.        It is usually only under exceptionally favoring conditions that      foot-fetichism occurs, as in the case recorded by Marandon de      Montyel of a doctor who had been brought up in the West Indies.      His mother had been insane and he himself was subject to      obsessions, especially of being incapable of urinating; he had      had nocturnal incontinence of urine in childhood. All the women      of the people in the West Indies go about with naked feet, which      are often beautiful. His puberty evolved under this influence,      and foot-fetichism developed. He especially admired large, fat,      arched feet, with delicate skin and large, regular toes. He      masturbated with images of feet. At 15 he had relations with a      colored chambermaid, but feared to mention his fetichism, though      it was the touch of her feet that chiefly excited him. He now      gave up masturbation, and had a succession of mistresses, but was      always ashamed to confess his fancies until, at the age of 33, in      Paris, a very intelligent woman who had become his mistress      discovered his mania and skillfully enabled him to yield to it      without shock to his modesty. He was devoted to this mistress,      who had very beautiful feet (he had been horrified by the feet "]]]
