Little Rock District  FOLKLORE SUBJECTS  Name of Interviewer: Irene Robertson  Subject: Ex-Slave--History  Story:--Information    This Information given by: Warren McKinney  Place of Residence: Hazen, Green Grove Settlement, Arkansas  Occupation: Farming  Age: 84  [TR: Information moved from bottom of first page.]      Warren McKinney was born in Edgefield County, South Carolina. He was  born a slave. His master was George Strauter. He had a big plantation  and worked twenty-five or thirty work hands. There were twenty-five or  thirty children too small to work in the field. They raised cotton,  corn, oats, and wheat. His mother washed and ironed and cooked. He was  small but well remembers once when his mother had been sick and had just  gotten out. George Strauter whipped her with a switch on her legs.  Warren did not approve of it. Rocks were plentiful and he began throwing  at him. He said Mr. George took out after him but didn't catch or whip  him.    George Strauter tried to teach them all how to be good farmers and be  saving. Warren knew war was going on but he didn't see any of it. His  father came home several times. He was off building forts. He said he  remembered a big \"hurly-burly\" and he heard 'em saying, \"Thank God I'ze  free as a jay bird.\" He didn't know why they were fighting so he didn't  know then why they were saying that.    George Strauter had a shop at the fork of the roads. He had his own gin.  They sold cotton and bought provisions at Augusta, Georgia. They made  some of their meal and flour and raised all their meat and made enough  lard to do the year around.    He heard them talking about the \"Yankees\" burning up Augusta, but he saw  where they had burned Hamburg, South Carolina or North Augusta they call  it.    After they were free he remembers his mother bundling up her things and  her family and them all going in an ox cart to Augusta to live. Warren's  mother washed, cooked and ironed for a living. Her husband went off and  lived with another woman after freedom. Warren was about eleven years  old then. The Government furnished food for them too. One thing that  distressed Warren was _the way people died for more than a year_. He saw  five or six coffins piled up on a wagon being taken out to be buried. He  thought it was changing houses and changing ways of living. They didn't  have shoes and warm clothes and weren't fed from white folks smoke  house. _Lots of the slaves had Consumption and died right now_. Stout  men and women didn't live two years after they were freed. Lots of them  said they didn't like that freedom and wanted to go back but the masters  were broke and couldn't keep many of them if they went back.    When Warren was about fifteen years old, there was a white man or two,  but colored leaders mostly got about a thousand colored people to start  for the West walking. Warren had sisters and brothers who started on  this trip. Warren had some fussy brothers, his mother was afraid would  get in jail. They kept her uneasy. They shipped their \"stuff\" by boat  and train. He never saw them any more but he heard from them in  Louisiana. Louisiana had a bad name in those days.    When Warren was about fourteen and fifteen, his mother had them on a  farm, farming near Hamburg.    When he was sixteen or seventeen, his mother and the other children came  on the train to about where Carlisle now is but it wasn't called by that  name. There were very few houses of any kind. Mr. Emerson had a big  store and lots of land. He worked black and white. Mr. Emerson let them  have seven or eight mules and wagons and they farmed near there. He  remembers pretty soon there was a depot where the depot now stands, a  bank, a post office, and two or three more stores, all small buildings.  He liked coming to Arkansas because he got to ride on the train a long  ways. It was easy to live here. There were lots of game and fish.    Warren never shot anything in his life. He was no hunter. _Nats_ were  awful. Warren made smoke to run the nats from the cows. Four or five  deer would come to the smoke. Cows were afraid of them and would leave  the smoke. When he would go the deer would leap four or five feet in the  air at the sight of him.    When Warren lived in Augusta, Georgia, they had schools a month at a  time but Warren never did get to go to any, so he can't read or write.  But he learned to save his money. He joined a church when he was twelve  years old in South Carolina and belongs to the Baptist church at Green  Grove now.    The old master in South Carolina persuaded his mother to come back. They  all went back four or five years before his mother died. While Warren  was there he married a woman on a joining farm.          Interviewer: Samuel S. Taylor  Person interviewed: Victoria McMullen                      1416 E. Valmar, Little Rock, Arkansas  Age: 54  Occupation: Seamstress      \"My mother was born March 16, 1865, and knew nothing of slavery.    \"Both my grandmothers and both grandfathers were slaves. My father was  born in the same year as my mother and like my mother knew nothing of  slavery although both of them might have been born slaves.    \"I knew my mother's mother and father and my father's mother, but I  didn't know my father's father.    \"He was from Texas and he always stayed there. He never did come out to  Louisiana where I was born. My mother was born in Louisiana, but my  father was born in Texas. I don't know what county or city my father was  born in. I just heard my grandmother on his side say he was born in  Texas.    \"During the War (he was born in '65 when the War ceased), Grandmother  Katy--that was her name, Katy, Katy Elmore--she was in Louisiana at  first--she was run out in Texas, I suppose, to be hidden from the  Yankees. My father was born there and my grandfather stayed there. He  died in Texas and then Grandma Katy come back to Louisiana with my  father and settled in Ouachita Parish.    \"Grandma Katy was sold from South Carolina into Louisiana to Bob  McClendon, and she kept the name of Elmore who was her first owner in  South Carolina. It was Bob McClendon who run her out in Texas to hide  her from the Yankees. My grandfather in Texas kept the name of Jamison.  That was the name of his master in Texas. But grandma kept the name of  Elmore from South Carolina because he was good to her. He was better  than Bob McClendon. The eastern states sold their slaves to the southern  states and got all the money, then they freed the slaves and that left  the South without anything.    \"Grandma Katy had Creek Indian blood in her. She was of medium size and  height, copper colored, high cheek bones, small squinchy eyes, black  curly hair. Her hair was really pretty but she didn't curl it. It was  just naturally curly. She was a practical nurse as they call it, but she  did more of what some people call a midwife. They call it something else  now. They got a proper word for it.    \"They got it in these government agencies. That is what she was even in  slavery times. She worked for colored people and white people both. That  was after she was freed until she went blind. She went blind three years  before she died. She died at the age of exactly one hundred years. She  treated women and babies. They said she was a real good doctor in her  day. That is been fifty-four years ago. [I will be fifty-four years old  tomorrow--September 18, 1938.] In slavery times my grandma was almost as  free as she was in freedom because of her work.    \"She said that Bob McClendon was cruel to her. Sometimes he'd get angry  and take the shovel and throw hot ashes on the slaves. And then he'd see  them with blisters on them and he would take a handsaw or a flat plank  and bust the blisters. Louisiana was a warm country and they wouldn't  have much clothes on. When the slaves were freed, he went completely  broke. He had scarcely a place to live.    \"I seen him once. Be look like on old possum. He had a long beard down  to his waist and he had long side burns too. Just a little of his face  showed. He was tall and stooping and he wore his hair long and uncut  down on his neck. You know about what he looked like. He had on blue  jeans pants and brogan shoes and a common shirt--a work shirt. He wore  very common clothes. When they freed the Negroes, it broke him up  completely. He had been called a 'big-to-do' in his life but he wasn't  nothing then. He owned Grandma Katy.    \"Grandma Katy had a sister named Maria and a brother named Peter. He  owned all three of them. I have seen all of them. Grandma Katy was the  oldest. She and Uncle Peter stayed close together. He didn't have no  wife and she didn't have no husband. But Aunt Maria had a husband. She  lived off from them after freedom. It was about twelve miles away. My  great-aunt and great-uncle--they were Maria and Peter--that was what  they were. Uncle Peter died first before I left Louisiana, but Aunt  Maria and Grandma Katy died after I came to Arkansas. Grandma Katy lived  four years after I came here.    \"After they was free and my father had gotten large enough to work and  didn't have no horse, my grandma was going 'round waiting on women--that  is all she did--all the rest of the people had gotten large and left  home. Papa made a crop with a hoe. He made three bales of cotton and  about twelve loads of corn with that hoe. He used to tell me, 'You don't  know nothin' 'bout work. You oughter see how I had to work.' After that  he bought him a horse. Money was scarce then and it took something to  buy the place and the horse both. They were turned loose from slavery  without anything. Hardly had a surname--just Katy, Maria, and Peter.    \"I knew more about the slave-time history of my mother's folks than I  did about my father's but I'll tell you that some other time. My  grandmother on my mother's side was born in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11547"],[0,"Blackfoot Lodge Tales: The Story of a Prairie People (#5)"],[1," the place, they found all the women  there dead, except this man's wife. Her they could not find. They also  found the two Indians that the man had said that he had killed, and,  besides, many others that he had killed when he was running away.      II    When he got back to the camp, this Blackfoot picked up his child and put it  on his back, and walked round the camp mourning and crying, and the child  crying, for four days and four nights, until he was exhausted and worn out,  and then he fell asleep. When the rest of the people saw him walking about  mourning, and that he would not eat nor drink, their hearts were very sore,  and they felt very sorry for him and for the child, for he was a man  greatly thought of by the people.    While he lay there asleep, the chief of the camp came to him and woke him,  and said: \"Well, friend, what have you decided on? What is your mind? What  are you going to do?\" The man answered: \"My child is lonely. It will not  eat. It is crying for its mother. It will not notice any one. I am going  to look for my wife.\" The chief said, \"I cannot say anything.\" He went  about to all the lodges and told the people that this man was going away to  seek his wife.    Now there was in the camp a strong medicine man, who was not married and  would not marry at all. He had said, \"When I had my dream, it told me that  I must never have a wife.\" The man who had lost his wife had a very  beautiful sister, who had never married. She was very proud and very  handsome. Many men had wanted to marry her, but she would not have anything  to do with any man. The medicine man secretly loved this handsome girl, the  sister of the poor man. When he heard of this poor man's misfortune, the  medicine man was in great sorrow, and cried over it. He sent word to the  poor man, saying: \"Go and tell this man that I have promised never to take  a wife, but that if he will give me his beautiful sister, he need not go to  look for his wife. I will send my secret helper in search of her.\"    When the young girl heard what this medicine man had said, she sent word to  him, saying, \"Yes, if you bring my brother's wife home, and I see her  sitting here by his side, I will marry you, but not before.\" But she did  not mean what she said. She intended to deceive him in some way, and not to  marry him at all. When the girl sent this message to him, the medicine man  sent for her and her brother to come to his lodge. When they had come, he  spoke to the poor man and said, \"If I bring your wife here, are you willing  to give me your sister for my wife?\" The poor man answered, \"Yes.\" But the  young girl kept quiet in his presence, and had nothing to say. Then the  medicine man said to them: \"Go. To-night in the middle of the night you  will hear me sing.\" He sent everybody out of his lodge, and said to the  people: \"I will close the door of my lodge, and I do not want any one to  come in to-night, nor to look through the door. A spirit will come to me  to-night.\" He made the people know, by a sign put out before the door of  his lodge, that no one must enter it, until such time as he was through  making his medicine. Then he built a fire, and began to get out all his  medicine. He unwrapped his bundle and took out his pipe and his rattles and  his other things. After a time, the fire burned down until it was only  coals and his lodge was dark, and on the fire he threw sweet-scented herbs,  sweet grass, and sweet pine, so as to draw his dream-helper to him.    Now in the middle of the night he was in the lodge singing, when suddenly  the people heard a strange voice in the lodge say: \"Well, my chief, I have  come. What is it?\" The medicine man said, \"I want you to help me.\" The  voice said, \"Yes, I know it, and I know what you want me to do.\" The  medicine man asked, \"What is it?\" The voice said, \"You want me to go and  get a woman.\" The medicine man answered: \"That is what I want. I want you  to go and get a woman--the lost woman.\" The voice said to him, \"Did I not  tell you never to call me, unless you were in great need of my help?\" The  medicine man answered, \"Yes, but that girl that was never going to be  married is going to be given to me through your help.\" Then the voice  said, \"Oh!\" and it was silent for a little while. Then it went on and said:  \"Well, we have a good feeling for you, and you have been a long time not  married; so we will help you to get that girl, and you will have her. Yes,  we have great pity on you. We will go and look for this woman, and will try  to find her, but I cannot promise you that we will bring her; but we will  try. We will go, and in four nights I will be back here again at this same  time, and I think that I can bring the woman; but I will not promise. While  I am gone, I will let you know how I get on. Now I am going away.\" And  then the people heard in the lodge a sound like a strong wind, and nothing  more. He was gone.    Some people went and told the sister what the medicine man and the voice  had been saying, and the girl was very down-hearted, and cried over the  idea that she must be married, and that she had been forced into it in this  way.      III    When the dream person went away, he came late at night to the camp of the  Snakes, the enemy. The woman who had been captured was always crying over  the loss of her man and her child. She had another husband now. The man who  had captured her had taken her for his wife. As she was lying there, in her  husband's lodge, crying for sorrow for her loss, the dream person came to  her. Her husband was asleep. The dream-helper touched her and pushed her a  little, and she looked up and saw a person standing by her side; but she  did not know who it was. The person whispered in her ear, \"Get up, I want  to take you home.\" She began to edge away from her husband, and at length  got up, and all the time the person was moving toward the door. She  followed him out, and saw him walk away from the lodge, and she went  after. The person kept ahead, and the woman followed him, and they went  away, travelling very fast. After they had travelled some distance, she  called out to the dream person to stop, for she was getting tired. Then the  person stopped, and when he saw the woman sitting, he would sit down, but  he would not talk to her.    As they travelled on, the woman, when she got tired, would sit down, and  because she was very tired, she would fall asleep; and when she awoke and  looked up, she always saw the person walking away from her, and she would  get up and follow him. When day came, the shape would be far ahead of her,  but at night it would keep closer. When she spoke to this person, the  woman would call him \"young man.\" At one time she said to him, \"Young man,  my moccasins are all worn out, and my feet are getting very sore, and I am  very tired and hungry.\" When she had said this, she sat down and fell  asleep, and as she was falling asleep, she saw the person going away from  her. He went back to the lodge of the medicine man.    During this night the camp heard the medicine man singing his song, and  they knew that the dream person must be back again, or that his chief must  be calling him. The medicine man had unwrapped his bundle, and had taken  out all his things, and again had a fire of coals, on which he burned sweet  pine and sweet grass. Those who were listening heard a voice say: \"Well, my  chief, I am back again, and I am here to tell you something. I am bringing  the woman you sent me after. She is very hungry and has no moccasins. Get  me those things, and I will take them back to her.\" The medicine man went  out of the lodge, and called to the poor man, who was mourning for his  wife, that he wanted to see him. The man came, carrying the child on his  back, to hear what the medicine man had to say. He said to him: \"Get some  moccasins and something to eat for your wife. I want to send them to  her. She is coming.\" The poor man went to his sister, and told her to give  him some moccasins and some pemmican. She made a bundle of these things,  and the man took them to the medicine man, who gave them to the dream  person; and again he disappeared out of the lodge like a wind.      IV    When the woman awoke in the morning and started to get up, she hit her face  against a bundle lying by her, and when she opened it, she found in it  moccasins and some pemmican; and she put on the moccasins and ate, and  while she was putting on the moccasins and eating, she looked over to where  she had last seen the person, and he was sitting there with his back toward  her. She could never see his face. When she had finished eating, he got up  and went on, and she rose and followed. They went on, and the woman  thought, \"Now I have travelled two days and two nights with this young man,  and I wonder what kind of a man he is. He seems to take no notice of me.\"  So she made up her mind to walk fast and to try to overtake him, and see  what sort of a man he was. She started to do so, but however fast she  walked, it made no difference. She could not overtake him. Whether she  walked fast, or whether she walked slow, he was always the same distance  from her. They travelled on until night, and then she lay down again and  fell asleep. She dreamed that the young man had left her again.    The dream person had really left her, and had gone back to the medicine  man's lodge, and said to him: \"Well, my chief, I am back again. I am  bringing the woman. You must tell this poor man to get on his horse, and  ride back toward Milk River (the Teton). Let him go in among the high hills  on this side of the Muddy, and let him wait there until daylight, and look  toward the hills of Milk River; and after the sun is up a little way, he  will see a band of antelope running toward him, along the trail that the  Blackfeet travel. It will be his wife who has frightened these  antelope. Let him wait there for a while, and he will see a"]]]
