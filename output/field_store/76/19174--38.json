Why, even an Indian respects desert law!\"    \"Bah! I'm not a Mormon or an Indian. I'm a cattleman. It's plain  business with me. Once more I make you the offer.\"    Naab scorned to reply. The men faced each other for a silent moment,  their glances scintillating. Then Holderness whirled on his heel,  jostling into Hare.    \"Get out of my way,\" said the rancher, in the disgust of intense  irritation. He swung his arm, and his open hand sent Hare reeling  against the counter.    \"Jack,\" said Naab, breathing hard, \"Holderness showed his real self to-  day. I always knew it, yet I gave him the benefit of the doubt.... For  him to strike you! I've not the gift of revelation, but I see--let us  go.\"    On the return to the Bishop's cottage Naab did not speak once; the  transformation which had begun with the appearance of his drunken son  had reached a climax of gloomy silence after the clash with Holderness.  Naab went directly to the Bishop, and presently the quavering voice of  the old minister rose in prayer.    Hare dropped wearily into the chair on the porch; and presently fell  into a doze, from which he awakened with a start. Naab's sons, with  Martin Cole and several other men, were standing in the yard. Naab  himself was gently crowding the women into the house. When he got them  all inside he closed the door and turned to Cole.    \"Was it a fair fight?\"    \"Yes, an even break. They met in front of Abe's. I saw the meeting.  Neither was surprised. They stood for a moment watching each other. Then  they drew--only Snap was quicker. Larsen's gun went off as he fell. That  trick you taught Snap saved his life again. Larsen was no slouch on the  draw.\"    \"Where's Snap now?\"    \"Gone after his pinto. He was sober. Said he'd pack at once. Larsen's  friends are ugly. Snap said to tell you to hurry out of the village with  young Hare, if you want to take him at all. Dene has ridden in; he  swears you won't take Hare away.\"    \"We're all packed and ready to hitch up,\" returned Naab. \"We could start  at once, only until dark I'd rather take chances here than out on the  trail.\"    \"Snap said Dene would ride right into the Bishop's after Hare.\"    \"No. He wouldn't dare.\"    \"Father!\" Dave Naab spoke sharply from where he stood high on a grassy  bank. \"Here's Dene now, riding up with Culver, and some man I don't  know. They're coming in. Dene's jumped the fence! Look out!\"    A clatter of hoofs and rattling of gravel preceded the appearance of a  black horse in the garden path. His rider bent low to dodge the vines of  the arbor, and reined in before the porch to slip out of the saddle with  the agility of an Indian. It was Dene, dark, smiling, nonchalant.    \"What do you seek in the house of a Bishop?\" challenged August Naab,  planting his broad bulk square before Hare.    \"Dene's spy!\"    \"What do you seek in the house of a Bishop?\" repeated Naab.    \"I shore want to see the young feller you lied to me about,\" returned  Dene, his smile slowly fading.    \"No speech could be a lie to an outlaw.\"    \"I want him, you Mormon preacher!\"    \"You can't have him.\"    \"I'll shore get him.\"    In one great stride Naab confronted and towered over Dene.    The rustler's gaze shifted warily from Naab to the quiet Mormons and  back again. Then his right hand quivered and shot downward. Naab's act  was even quicker. A Colt gleamed and whirled to the grass, and the  outlaw cried as his arm cracked in the Mormon's grasp.    Dave Naab leaped off the bank directly in front of Dene's approaching  companions, and faced them, alert and silent, his hand on his hip.    August Naab swung the outlaw against the porch-post and held him there  with brawny arm.    \"Whelp of an evil breed!\" he thundered, shaking his gray head. \"Do you  think we fear you and your gunsharp tricks? Look! See this!\" He released  Dene and stepped back with his hand before him. Suddenly it moved,  quicker than sight, and a Colt revolver lay in his outstretched palm. He  dropped it back into the holster. \"Let that teach you never to draw on  me again.\" He doubled his huge fist and shoved it before Dene's eyes.  \"One blow would crack your skull like an egg-shell. Why don't I deal it?  Because, you mindless hell-hound, because there's a higher law than  man's--God's law--Thou shalt not kill! Understand that if you can. Leave  me and mine alone from this day. Now go!\"    He pushed Dene down the path into the arms of his companions.    \"Out with you!\" said Dave Naab. \"Hurry! Get your horse. Hurry! I'm not  so particular about God as Dad is!\"              III. THE TRAIL OF THE RED WALL    AFTER the departure of Dene and his comrades Naab decided to leave White  Sage at nightfall. Martin Cole and the Bishop's sons tried to persuade  him to remain, urging that the trouble sure to come could be more safely  met in the village. Naab, however, was obdurate, unreasonably so, Cole  said, unless there were some good reason why he wished to strike the  trail in the night. When twilight closed in Naab had his teams ready and  the women shut in the canvas-covered wagons. Hare was to ride in an open  wagon, one that Naab had left at White Sage to be loaded with grain.  When it grew so dark that objects were scarcely discernible a man  vaulted the cottage fence.    \"Dave, where are the boys?\" asked Naab.    \"Not so loud! The boys are coming,\" replied Dave in a whisper. \"Dene is  wild. I guess you snapped a bone in his arm. He swears he'll kill us  all. But Chance and the rest of the gang won't be in till late. We've  time to reach the Coconina Trail, if we hustle.\"    \"Any news of Snap?\"    \"He rode out before sundown.\"    Three more forms emerged from the gloom.    \"All right, boys. Go ahead, Dave, you lead.\"    Dave and George Naab mounted their mustangs and rode through the gate;  the first wagon rolled after them, its white dome gradually dissolving  in the darkness; the second one started; then August Naab stepped to his  seat on the third with a low cluck to the team. Hare shut the gate and  climbed over the tail-board of the wagon.    A slight swish of weeds and grasses brushing the wheels was all the  sound made in the cautious advance. A bare field lay to the left; to the  right low roofs and sharp chimneys showed among the trees; here and  there lights twinkled. No one hailed; not a dog barked.    Presently the leaders turned into a road where the iron hoofs and wheels  cracked and crunched the stones.    Hare thought he saw something in the deep shade of a line of poplar-  trees; he peered closer, and made out a motionless horse and rider, just  a shade blacker than the deepest gloom. The next instant they vanished,  and the rapid clatter of hoofs down the road told Hare his eyes had not  deceived him.    \"Getup,\" growled Naab to his horses. \"Jack, did you see that fellow?\"    \"Yes. What was he doing there?\"    \"Watching the road. He's one of Dene's scouts.\"    \"Will Dene--\"    One of Naab's sons came trotting back. \"Think that was Larsen's pal. He  was laying in wait for Snap.\"    \"I thought he was a scout for Dene,\" replied August.    \"Maybe he's that too.\"    \"Likely enough. Hurry along and keep the gray team going lively. They've  had a week's rest.\"    Hare watched the glimmering lights of the village vanish one by one,  like Jack-o'-lanterns. The horses kept a steady, even trot on into the  huge windy hall of the desert night. Fleecy clouds veiled the stars, yet  transmitted a wan glow. A chill crept over Hare. As he crawled under the  blankets Naab had spread for him his hand came into contact with a  polished metal surface cold as ice. It was his rifle. Naab had placed it  under the blankets. Fingering the rifle Hare found the spring opening on  the right side of the breech, and, pressing it down, he felt the round  head of a cartridge. Naab had loaded the weapon, he had placed it where  Hare's hand must find it, yet he had not spoken of it. Hare did not stop  to reason with his first impulse. Without a word, with silent  insistence, disregarding his shattered health, August Naab had given him  a man's part to play. The full meaning lifted Hare out of his self-  abasement; once more he felt himself a man.    Hare soon yielded to the warmth of the blankets; a drowsiness that he  endeavored in vain to throw off smothered his thoughts; sleep glued his  eyelids tight. They opened again some hours later. For a moment he could  not realize where he was; then the whip of the cold wind across his  face, the woolly feel and smell of the blankets, and finally the steady  trot of horses and the clink of a chain swinging somewhere under him,  recalled the actuality of the night ride. He wondered how many miles had  been covered, how the drivers knew the direction and kept the horses in  the trail, and whether the outlaws were in pursuit. When Naab stopped  the team and, climbing down, walked back some rods to listen, Hare felt  sure that Dene was coming. He listened, too, but the movements of the  horses and the rattle of their harness were all the sounds he could  hear. Naab returned to his seat; the team started, now no longer in a  trot; they were climbing. After that Hare fell into a slumber in which  he could hear the slow grating whirr of wheels, and when it ceased he  awoke to raise himself and turn his ear to the back trail. By-and-by he  discovered that the black night had changed to gray; dawn was not far  distant; he dozed and awakened to clear light. A rose-red horizon lay  far below and to the eastward; the intervening descent was like a  rolling sea with league-long swells.    \"Glad you slept some,\" was Naab's greeting. \"No sign of Dene yet. If we  can get over the divide we're safe. That's Coconina there, Fire Mountain  in Navajo meaning. It's a plateau low and narrow at this end, but it  runs far to the east and rises nine thousand feet. It forms a hundred  miles of the north"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12625"],[0,"Architecture and Democracy (#5)"],[1,"divided into side aisles, nave, and crossing, with galleries and  mezzanines so arranged as to shorten the arms of the cross in its  upper stages, leaving the clear-story surrounding the crossing  unimpeded and well defined. The light comes for the most part from  high windows, filtering down, in tempered brightness to the floor. The  bones of the structure are everywhere in evidence, and an element of  its beauty, by reason of the admirably direct and logical  arrangement of posts and trusses. The vertical walls are covered with  plaster-board of a light buff color, converted into good sized  panels by means of wooden strips finished with a thin grey stain. The  structural wood work is stained in similar fashion, the iron rods,  straps, and bolts being painted black. This color scheme is  completed and a little enlivened by red stripes and crosses placed at  appropriate intervals in the general design.    The building attained its final synthesis through the collaboration of  a Cleveland architect and a National Army captain of engineers. It is  so single in its appeal that one does not care to inquire too closely  into the part of each in the performance; both are in evidence, for  an architect seldom succeeds in being so direct and simple, while an  engineer seldom succeeds in being so gracious and altogether suave.    Entirely aside from its aesthetic interest--based as this is on beauty  of organism almost alone--the building is notable for the success with  which it fulfils and co-ordinates its manifold functions: those of a  dormitory, a restaurant, a ballroom, a theatre, and a lounge. The  arm of the cross containing the principal entrance accommodates the  office, coat room, telephones, news and cigar stand, while leaving  the central nave unimpeded, so that from the door one gets the unusual  effect of an interior vista two hundred feet long. The restaurant  occupies the entire left transept, with a great brick fireplace at the  far end. There is another fireplace in the centre of the side of  the arm beyond the crossing; that part which would correspond in a  cathedral to the choir and apse being given over to the uses of a  reading and writing room. The right transept forms a theatre, on  occasion, terminating as it does with a stage. The central floor  spaces are kept everywhere free except in the restaurant, the sides  and angles being filled in with leather-covered sofas, wicker and  wooden chairs and tables, arranged in groups favourable to comfort and  conversation. Two stairways, at the right and left of the restaurant,  give access to the ample balcony and to the bedrooms, which occupy  three of the four ends of the arms of the cross at this level.    The appearance and atmosphere of this great interior is inspiring;  particularly of an evening, when it is thronged with soldiers, and  civilian guests. The strains of music, the hum of many voices, the  rhythmic shuffle on the waxed floor of the feet of the dancers--these  eminently social sounds mingle and lose themselves in the spaces of  the roof, like the voice of many waters. Tobacco smoke ascends like  incense, blue above the prevailing green-brown of the crowd, shot here  and there with brighter colors from the women's hats and dresses, in  the kaleidoscopic shifting of the dance. Long parallel rows of orange  lights, grouped low down on the lofty pillars, reflect themselves  on the polished floor, and like the patina of time on painted canvas  impart to the entire animated picture an incomparable tone. For the  lighting, either by accident or by inspiration, is an achievement  of the happiest, an example of the friendliness of fate to him who  attempts a free solution of his problem. The brackets consist merely  of a cruciform arrangement of planed pine boards about each column,  with the end grain painted red. On the under side of each arm of the  cross is a single electric bulb enclosed within an orange-coloured  shade to kill the glare. The light makes the bare wood of the fixture  appear incandescent, defining its geometry in rose colour with the  most beautiful effect.    The club house is the centre of the social and ceremonial life of the  camp, for balls, dinners, receptions, conferences, concerts without  number; and it has been the scene of a military wedding--the daughter  of a major-general to the grandson of an ex-president. To these events  the unassuming, but pervasive beauty of the place lends a dignity new  to our social life. In our army camps social life is truly democratic,  as any one who has experienced it does not need to be told. Not alone  have the conditions of conscription conspired to make it so, but there  is a manifest _will-to-democracy_--the growing of a new flower of  the spirit, sown in a community of sacrifice, to reach its maturity,  perhaps, only in a community of suffering.    The author may seem to have over-praised this Community Club House;  with the whole country to draw from for examples it may well appear  fatuous to concentrate the reader's attention, for so long, on a  building in a remote part of the Middle West: cheap, temporary,  and requiring only twenty-one days for its erection. But of the  transvaluation of values brought about by the war, this building is  an eminent example: it stands in symbolic relation to the times; it  represents what may be called the architecture of Service; it is among  the first of the new temples of the new democracy, dedicated to the  uses of simple, rational social life. Notwithstanding that it fills a  felt need, common to every community, there is nothing like it in  any of our towns and cities; there are only such poor and partial  substitutes as the hotel, the saloon, the dance hall, the lodge room  and the club. It is scarcely conceivable that the men and women who  have experienced its benefits and its beauty should not demand and  have similar buildings in their own home towns.    [Illustration: PLATE VII. INTERIOR OF THE CAMP SHERMAN COMMUNITY  HOUSE]    Beyond the oasis of the Community Club House at Camp Sherman stretch  the cantonments--a Euclidian nightmare of bare boards, black roofs  and ditches, making grim vistas of straight lines. This is the  architecture of Need in contradistinction to the architecture of  Greed, symbolized in the shop-window prettiness of those sanitary  suburbs of our cities created by the real estate agent and the  speculative builder. Neither contain any enduring element of beauty.    But the love of beauty in one form or another exists in every human  heart, and if too long or too rigorously denied it finds its own  channels of fulfilment. This desire for self-expression through beauty  is an important, though little remarked phenomenon of these mid-war  times. At the camps it shows itself in the efforts of men of  specialized tastes and talents to get together and form dramatic  organizations, glee clubs, and orchestras; and more generally by the  disposition of the soldiers to sing together at work and play and on  the march. The renascence of poetry can be interpreted as a revulsion  against the prevailing prosiness; the amateur theatre is equally a  protest against the inanity and conventionality of the commercial  stage; while the Community Chorus movement is an evidence of a desire  to escape a narrow professionalism in music. A similar situation  has arisen in the field of domestic architecture, in the form of  an unorganized, but wide-spread reaction against the cheap and ugly  commercialism which has dominated house construction and decoration of  the more unpretentious class. This became articulate a few years ago  in the large number of books and magazines devoted to house-planning,  construction, decoration, furnishing, and garden-craft. The success  which has attended these publications, and their marked influence,  give some measure of the magnitude of this revolt.    But now attention must be called to a significant, and somewhat  sinister fact. The professional in these various fields of aesthetic  endeavour, has shown either indifference or active hostility toward  all manner of amateur efforts at self-expression. Free verse aroused  the ridicule of the professors of metrics; the Little Theatre movement  was solemnly banned by such pundits as Belasco and Mrs. Fiske; the  Community Chorus movement has invariably met with opposition and  misunderstanding from professional musicians; and with few exceptions  the more influential architects have remained aloof from the effort  to give skilled architectural assistance to those who cannot afford to  pay them ten per cent.    Thus everywhere do we discover a deadening hand laid upon the  self-expression of the democratic spirit through beauty. Its enemies  are of its own household; those who by nature and training should  be its helpers hinder it instead. Why do they do this? Because their  fastidious, aesthetic natures are outraged by a crudeness which they  themselves could easily refine away if they chose; because also they  recoil at a lack of conformity to existing conventions--conventions  so hampering to the inner spirit of the Newness, that in order to  incarnate at all it must of necessity sweep them aside.    But in every field of aesthetic endeavour appears here and there a  man or a woman with unclouded vision, who is able to see in the  flounderings of untrained amateurs the stirrings of _demos_ from his  age-long sleep. These, often forsaking paths more profitable, lend  their skilled assistance, not seeking to impose the ancient outworn  forms upon the Newness, but by a transfusion of consciousness  permitting it to create forms of its own. Such a one, in architecture,  Louis Sullivan has proved himself; in music Harry Barnhart, who evokes  the very spirit of song from any random crowd. The _demos_ found voice  first in the poetry of Walt Whitman who has a successor in Vachel  Lindsay, the man who walked through Kansas, trading poetry"]]]
