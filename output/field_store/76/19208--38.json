But it  should be kept in mind that that word covers and includes three forms of  intercourse. All prayer grows up through, and ever continues in three  stages.    The first form of prayer is _communion_. That is simply being on good  terms with God. It involves the blood of the cross as the basis of our  getting and being on good terms. It involves my coming to God through  Jesus. Communion is fellowship with God. Not request for some particular  thing; not asking, but simply enjoying Himself, loving Him, thinking about  Him, how beautiful, and intelligent, and strong and loving and lovable He  is; talking to Him without words. That is the truest worship, thinking how  worthy He is of all the best we can possibly bring to Him, and infinitely  more. It has to do wholly with God and a man being on good terms with each  other. Of necessity it includes confession on my part and forgiveness upon  God's part, for only so can we come into the relation of fellowship.  Adoration, worship belong to this first phase of prayer. Communion is the  basis of all prayer. It is the essential breath of the true Christian  life. It concerns just two, God and myself, yourself. Its influence is  directly subjective. _It affects me._    The second form of prayer is _petition_. And I am using that word now in  the narrower meaning of asking something for one's self. Petition is  definite request of God for something I need. A man's whole life is  utterly dependent upon the giving hand of God. Everything we need comes  from Him. Our friendships, ability to make money, health, strength in  temptation, and in sorrow, guidance in difficult circumstances, and in all  of life's movements; help of all sorts, financial, bodily, mental,  spiritual--all come from God, and necessitate a constant touch with Him.  There needs to be a constant stream of petition going up, many times  wordless prayer. And there will be a constant return stream of answer and  supply coming down. The door between God and one's own self must be kept  ever open. The knob to be turned is on our side. He opened His side long  ago, and propped it open, and threw the knob away. The whole life hinges  upon this continual intercourse with our wondrous God. This is the second  stage or form of prayer. It concerns just two: God and the man dealing  with God. It is subjective in its influence: _its reach is within_.    The third form of prayer is _intercession_. True prayer never stops with  petition for one's self. It reaches out for others. The very word  intercession implies a reaching out for some one else. It is standing as a  go-between, a mutual friend, between God and some one who is either out of  touch with Him, or is needing special help. Intercession is the climax of  prayer. It is the outward drive of prayer. It is the effective end of  prayer _outward_. Communion and petition are upward and downward.  Intercession rests upon these two as its foundation. Communion and  petition store the life with the power of God; intercession lets it out on  behalf of others. The first two are necessarily for self; this third is  for others. They ally a man fully with God: it makes use of that alliance  for others. Intercession is the full-bloomed plant whose roots and  strength lie back and down in the other two forms. _It_ is the form of  prayer that helps God in His great love-plan for winning a planet back to  its true sphere. It will help through these talks to keep this simple  analysis of prayer in mind. For much that will be said will deal chiefly  with this third form, intercession, the outward movement of prayer.        <u>The Climax of Prayer.</u>      To God man is first an objective point, and then, without ceasing to be  that, he further becomes a distributing centre. God ever thinks of a man  doubly: first for his own self, and then for his possible use in reaching  others. Communion and petition fix and continue one's relation to God, and  so prepare for the great outreaching form of prayer--intercession. Prayer  must begin in the first two but reaches its climax in the third. Communion  and petition are of necessity self-wide. Intercession is world-wide in its  reach. And all true rounded prayer will ever have all three elements in  it. There must be the touch with God. One's constant needs make constant  petition. But the heart of the true follower has caught the warm contagion  of the heart of God and reaches out hungrily for the world. Intercession  is the climax of prayer.    Much is said of the subjective and objective value of prayer; its  influence upon one's self, and its possible influence upon persons and  events quite outside of one's self. Of necessity the first two sorts of  prayer here named are subjective; they have to do wholly with one's self.  Of equal necessity intercessory prayer is objective; it has to do wholly  with others. There is even here a reflex influence; in the first two  directly subjective; here incidentally reflex. Contact with God while  dealing with Him for another of necessity influences me. But that is the  mere fringe of the garment. The main driving purpose is outward.    Just now in certain circles it seems quite the thing to lay great stress  upon the subjective value of prayer and to whittle down small, or, deny  entirely its value in influencing others. Some who have the popular ear  are quite free with tongue and pen in this direction. From both without  and within distinctly Christian circles their voices come. One wonders if  these friends lay the greater emphasis on the subjective value of prayer  so as to get a good deep breath for their hard drive at the other. Yet the  greater probability is that they honestly believe as they say, but have  failed to grasp the full perspective of the picture. In listening to such  statements one remembers with vivid distinctness that the scriptural  _standpoint_ always is this: that things quite outside of one's self, that  in the natural order of prevailing circumstances would not occur, are made  to occur through prayer. Jesus constantly so _assumed_. The first-flush,  commonsense view of successful prayer is that some actual result is  secured through its agency.    It is an utter begging of the question to advance such a theory as a  sufficient explanation of prayer. For prayer in its simplest conception  supposes something changed that is not otherwise reachable. Both from the  scriptural, and from a rugged philosophical standpoint the objective is  the real driving point of all full prayer. The subjective is in order to  the objective, as the final outward climactic reach of God's great  love-plan for a world.        <u>Six Facts Underlying Prayer.</u>      It will help greatly to step back and up a bit for a fresh look at certain  facts that underlie prayer. Everything depends on a right point of view.  There may be many view-points, from which to study any subject; but of  necessity any one view-point must take in all the essential facts  concerned. If not, the impression formed will be wrong, and a man will be  misled in his actions. In these talks I make no attempt to prove the  Bible's statements, nor to suggest a common law for their interpretation.  That would be a matter for quite a separate series of talks. It clears the  ground to assume certain things. I am assuming the accuracy of these  scriptural statements. And I am glad to say I have no difficulty in doing  so.    Now there are certain facts constantly stated and assumed in this old  Book. They are clearly stated in its history, they are woven into its  songs, and they underlie all these prophetic writings, from Genesis clear  to the end of John's Patmos visions. Possibly they have been so familiar  and taken for granted so long as to have grown unfamiliar. The very old  may need stating as though very new. Here is a chain of six facts:    First:--The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.[3] His by  creation and by sovereign rule. The Lord sat as King at the flood.[4]    Second:--God gave the dominion of the earth to man. The kingship of its  life, the control and mastery of its forces.[5]    Third:--Man, who held the dominion of the earth in trust from God,  transferred his dominion to somebody else, by an act which was a double  act. He was deceived into doing that act. It was an act of disobedience  and of obedience. Disobedience to God, and obedience to another one, a  prince who was seeking to get the dominion of the earth into his own  hands. That act of the first man did this. The disobedience broke with  God, and transferred the allegiance from God. The obedience to the other  one transferred the allegiance, and through that, the dominion to this  other one.    The fourth fact is this:--The dominion or kingship of this earth so far  as given to man, is now not God's, for He gave it to man. And it is not  man's, for he has transferred it to another. It is in the control of that  magnificent prince whose changed character supplies his name--Satan, the  hater, the enemy. Jesus repeatedly speaks of \"the prince\"--that is the  ruling one--\"of this world.\"[6] John speaks in his vision-book of a time  coming when \"the kingdom (not kingdoms, as in the old version) of the  world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of His Christ.\"[7] By clear  inference previous to that time it is somebody's else kingdom than His.  The kingship or rulership of the earth which was given to man is now  Satan's.    The fifth fact:--God was eager to swing the world back to its original  sway: for His own sake, for man's sake, for the earth's sake. You see, we  do not know God's world as it came from His hand. It is a rarely beautiful  world even yet--the stars above, the plant life, the waters, the exquisite  colouring and blending, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13202"],[0,"\"Co.

STANDING PICKET ON THE POTOMAC    Leaving Winchester, we continued up the valley.    The night before the attack on Bath or Berkly Springs, there fell the  largest snow I ever saw.    Stonewall Jackson had seventeen thousand soldiers at his command.  The Yankees were fortified at Bath.  An attack was ordered, our regiment  marched upon top of a mountain overlooking the movements of both armies  in the valley below.  About 4 o'clock one grand charge and rush was made,  and the Yankees were routed and skedaddled.    By some circumstance or other, Lieutenant J. Lee Bullock came in command  of the First Tennessee Regiment.  But Lee was not a graduate of West  Point, you see.    The Federals had left some spiked batteries on the hill side, as we  were informed by an old citizen, and Lee, anxious to capture a battery,  gave the new and peculiar command of, \"Soldiers, you are ordered to go  forward and capture a battery; just piroute up that hill; piroute, march.  Forward, men; piroute carefully.\"  The boys \"pirouted\" as best they  could.  It may have been a new command, and not laid down in Hardee's or  Scott's tactics; but Lee was speaking plain English, and we understood  his meaning perfectly, and even at this late day I have no doubt that  every soldier who heard the command thought it a legal and technical term  used by military graduates to go forward and capture a battery.    At this place (Bath), a beautiful young lady ran across the street.  I have seen many beautiful and pretty women in my life, but she was  the prettiest one I ever saw.  Were you to ask any member of the First  Tennessee Regiment who was the prettiest woman he ever saw, he would  unhesitatingly answer that he saw her at Berkly Springs during the war,  and he would continue the tale, and tell you of Lee Bullock's piroute  and Stonewall Jackson's charge.    We rushed down to the big spring bursting out of the mountain side,  and it was hot enough to cook an egg.  Never did I see soldiers more  surprised.  The water was so hot we could not drink it.    The snow covered the ground and was still falling.    That night I stood picket on the Potomac with a detail of the Third  Arkansas Regiment.  I remember how sorry I felt for the poor fellows,  because they had enlisted for the war, and we for only twelve months.  Before nightfall I took in every object and commenced my weary vigils.  I had to stand all night.  I could hear the rumblings of the Federal  artillery and wagons, and hear the low shuffling sound made by troops on  the march.  The snow came pelting down as large as goose eggs.  About  midnight the snow ceased to fall, and became quiet.  Now and then the  snow would fall off the bushes and make a terrible noise.  While I was  peering through the darkness, my eyes suddenly fell upon the outlines of  a man.  The more I looked the more I was convinced that it was a Yankee  picket.  I could see his hat and coat--yes, see his gun.  I was sure  that it was a Yankee picket.  What was I to do?  The relief was several  hundred yards in the rear.  The more I looked the more sure I was.  At last a cold sweat broke out all over my body.  Turkey bumps rose.  I summoned all the nerves and bravery that I could command, and said:  \"Halt! who goes there?\"  There being no response, I became resolute.  I did not wish to fire and arouse the camp, but I marched right up to it  and stuck my bayonet through and through it.  It was a stump.  I tell the  above, because it illustrates a part of many a private's recollections  of the war; in fact, a part of the hardships and suffering that they go  through.    One secret of Stonewall Jackson's success was that he was such a strict  disciplinarian.  He did his duty himself and was ever at his post,  and he expected and demanded of everybody to do the same thing.  He would  have a man shot at the drop of a hat, and drop it himself.  The first  army order that was ever read to us after being attached to his corps,  was the shooting to death by musketry of two men who had stopped on the  battlefield to carry off a wounded comrade.  It was read to us in line  of battle at Winchester.      SCHWARTZ AND PFIFER    At Valley Mountain the finest and fattest beef I ever saw was issued to  the soldiers, and it was the custom to use tallow for lard.  Tallow made  good shortening if the biscuits were eaten hot, but if allowed to get  cold they had a strong taste of tallow in their flavor that did not  taste like the flavor of vanilla or lemon in ice cream and strawberries;  and biscuits fried in tallow were something upon the principle of 'possum  and sweet potatoes.  Well, Pfifer had got the fat from the kidneys of  two hind quarters and made a cake of tallow weighing about twenty-five  pounds.  He wrapped it up and put it carefully away in his knapsack.  When the assembly sounded for the march, Pfifer strapped on his knapsack.  It was pretty heavy, but Pfifer was \"well heeled.\"  He knew the good  frying he would get out of that twenty-five pounds of nice fat tallow,  and he was willing to tug and toil all day over a muddy and sloppy road  for his anticipated hot tallow gravy for supper.  We made a long and hard  march that day, and about dark went into camp.  Fires were made up and  water brought, and the soldiers began to get supper.  Pfifer was in a  good humor.  He went to get that twenty-five pounds of good, nice,  fat tallow out of his knapsack, and on opening it, lo and behold! it was  a rock that weighed about thirty pounds.  Pfifer was struck dumb with  amazement.  He looked bewildered, yea, even silly.  I do not think he  cursed, because he could not do the subject justice.  He looked at that  rock with the death stare of a doomed man.  But he suspected Schwartz.  He went to Schwartz's knapsack, and there he found his cake of tallow.  He went to Schwartz and would have killed him had not soldiers interfered  and pulled him off by main force.  His eyes blazed and looked like those  of a tiger when he has just torn his victim limb from limb.  I would  not have been in Schwartz's shoes for all the tallow in every beef in  Virginia.  Captain Harsh made Schwartz carry that rock for two days to  pacify Pfifer.      THE COURT-MARTIAL    One incident came under my observation while in Virginia that made a deep  impression on my mind.  One morning, about daybreak, the new guard was  relieving the old guard.  It was a bitter cold morning, and on coming to  our extreme outpost, I saw a soldier--he was but a mere boy--either dead  or asleep at his post.  The sergeant commanding the relief went up to him  and shook him.  He immediately woke up and seemed very much frightened.  He was fast asleep at his post.  The sergeant had him arrested and  carried to the guard-house.    Two days afterwards I received notice to appear before a court-martial at  nine.  I was summoned to appear as a witness against him for being asleep  at his post in the enemy's country.  An example had to be made of some  one.  He had to be tried for his life.  The court-martial was made up  of seven or eight officers of a different regiment.  The witnesses all  testified against him, charges and specifications were read, and by the  rules of war he had to be shot to death by musketry.  The Advocate-  General for the prosecution made the opening speech.  He read the law in  a plain, straightforward manner, and said that for a soldier to go to  sleep at his post of duty, while so much depended upon him, was the most  culpable of all crimes, and the most inexcusable.  I trembled in my boots,  for on several occasions I knew I had taken a short nap, even on the very  outpost.  The Advocate-General went on further to say, that the picket  was the sentinel that held the lives of his countrymen and the liberty  of his country in his hands, and it mattered not what may have been his  record in the past.  At one moment he had forfeited his life to his  country.  For discipline's sake, if for nothing else, you gentlemen that  make up this court-martial find the prisoner guilty.  It is necessary for  you to be firm, gentlemen, for upon your decision depends the safety of  our country.  When he had finished, thinks I to myself, \"Gone up the  spout, sure; we will have a first-class funeral here before night.\"    Well, as to the lawyer who defended him, I cannot now remember his  speeches; but he represented a fair-haired boy leaving his home and  family, telling his father and aged mother and darling little sister  farewell, and spoke of his proud step, though a mere boy, going to defend  his country and his loved ones; but at one weak moment, when nature,  tasked and taxed beyond the bounds of human endurance, could stand no  longer, and upon the still and silent picket post, when the whole army  was hushed in slumber, what wonder is it that he, too, may have fallen  asleep while at his post of duty.    Some of you gentlemen of this court-martial may have sons, may have  brothers; yes, even fathers, in the army.  Where are they tonight?  You love your children, or your brother or father.  This mere youth has  a father and mother and sister away back in Tennessee.  They are willing  to give him to his country.  But oh! gentlemen, let the word go back to  Tennessee that he died upon the battlefield, and not by the hands of his  own comrades for being asleep at his post of duty.  I cannot now remember  the speeches, but one thing I do know, that he was acquitted, and I was  glad of it.      \"THE DEATH WATCH\"    One more scene I can remember.  Kind friends--you that know nothing of a  soldier's life--I ask you in all candor not to doubt the following lines  in this sketch.  You have no doubt read of the old Roman soldier found  amid the ruins of Pompeii, who had stood there for sixteen hundred years,  and when he was excavated was found at his post with his gun clasped in  his "]]]
