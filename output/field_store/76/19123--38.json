At Wellington, a town a day's march from Shrewsbury, the king  had his little army formed up, and made a solemn declaration before them  in which he promised to maintain the Protestant religion, to observe the  laws, and to uphold the just privileges and freedom of Parliament.    The Furness band were not present on that occasion, as they had been  dispatched to Worcester with some other soldiers, the whole under the  command of Prince Rupert, in order to watch the movements of Essex, who  was advancing in that direction. While scouring the ground around the  city, they came upon a body of Parliamentary cavalry, the advance of the  army of Essex. The bands drew up at a little distance from each other,  and then Prince Rupert gave the command to charge. With the cheer of  \"For God and the king!\" the troop rushed upon the cavalry of the  Parliament with such force and fury that they broke them utterly, and  killing many, drove them in confusion from the field, but small loss to  themselves.    This was the first action of the civil war, the first blood drawn by  Englishmen from Englishmen since the troubles in the commencement of the  reign of Mary.          CHAPTER III.    A BRAWL AT OXFORD.      News in those days traveled but slowly, and England was full of  conflicting rumors as to the doings of the two armies. Every one was  unsettled. Bodies of men moving to join one or other of the parties kept  the country in an uproar, and the Cavaliers, or rather the toughs of the  towns calling themselves Cavaliers, brought much odium upon the royal  cause by the ill-treatment of harmless citizens, and by raids on  inoffensive country people. Later on this conduct was to be reversed and  the Royalists were to suffer tenfold the outrages now put upon the  Puritans. But there can be no doubt that the conduct of irresponsible  ruffians at that time did much to turn the flood of public opinion in  many places, where it would otherwise have remained neutral, against the  crown.    To Harry the time passed but slowly. He spent his days in Abingdon  hearing the latest news, and occasionally rode over to Oxford. This  city was throughout the civil war the heart of the Royalist party, and  its loss was one of the heaviest blows which befell the crown. Here  Harry found none but favorable reports current. Enthusiasm was at its  height. The university was even more loyal than the town, and bands of  lads smashed the windows of those persons who were supposed to favor the  Parliament. More than once Harry saw men pursued through the streets,  pelted with stones and mud, and in some cases escaping barely with  their lives. Upon one occasion, seeing a person in black garments and of  respectable appearance so treated, the boy's indignation was aroused,  for he himself, both from his conversations with his friend Herbert, and  the talk with his father, was, although enthusiastically Royalist, yet  inclined to view with respect those who held opposite opinions.    \"Run down that alley!\" he exclaimed, pushing his horse between the  fugitive and his pursuers.    The man darted down the lane, and Harry placed himself at the entrance,  and shouted to the rabble to abstain.    A yell of rage and indignation replied, and a volley of stones was  thrown. Harry fearlessly drew his sword, and cut at some of those who  were in the foreground. These retaliated with sticks, and Harry was  forced backward into the lane. This was too narrow to enable him to  turn, his horse, and his position was a critical one. Finding that he  was a mark for stones, he leaped from the saddle, thereby disappearing  from the sight of those in the ranks behind, and sword in hand, barred  the way to the foremost of his assailants. The contest, however, would  have been brief had not a party of young students come up the lane, and  seeing from Harry's attire that he was a gentleman, and likely to be of  Cavalier opinions, they at once, without inquiring the cause of the  fray, threw themselves into it, shouting \"Gown! gown!\" They speedily  drove the assailants back out of the lane; but these, reinforced by the  great body beyond, were then too strong for them. The shouts of the  young men, however, brought up others to their assistance, and a general  melee took place, townsmen and gownsmen throwing themselves into the  fray without any inquiry as to the circumstances from which it arose.  The young students carried swords, which, although contrary to the  statutes of the university, were for the time generally adopted. The  townspeople were armed with bludgeons, and in some cases with hangers,  and the fray was becoming a serious one, when it was abruptly terminated  by the arrival of a troop of horse, which happened to be coming into the  town to join the royal forces. The officer in command, seeing so  desperate a tumult raging, ordered his men to charge into the crowd, and  their interference speedily put an end to the fight.    Harry returned to their rooms with some of his protectors and their  wounds were bound up, and the circumstances of the fight were talked  over. Harry was much blamed by the college men when he said that he had  been drawn into the fray by protecting a Puritan. But when his new  friends learned that he was as thoroughly Royalist as themselves, and  that his father had gone with a troop to Nottingham, they took a more  favorable view of his action, but still assured him that it was the  height of folly to interfere to protect a rebel from the anger of the  townspeople.    \"But, methinks,\" Harry said, \"that it were unwise in the extreme to push  matters so far here. In Oxford the Royalists have it all their own way,  and can, of course, at will assault their Puritan neighbors. But it is  different in most other towns. There the Roundheads have the upper hand  and might retort by doing ill to the Cavaliers there. Surely it were  better to keep these unhappy differences out of private life, and to  trust the arbitration of our cause to the arms of our soldiers in the  field.\"    There was a general agreement that this would indeed be the wisest  course; but the young fellows were of opinion that hot heads on either  side would have their way, and that if the war went on attacks of this  kind by the one party on the other must be looked for.    Harry remained for some time with his friends in Christ church,  drinking the beer for which the college was famous. Then, mounting his  horse, he rode back to Abingdon.    Two days later, as he was proceeding toward the town, he met a man  dressed as a preacher.    \"Young sir,\" the latter said, \"may I ask if you are Master Furness?\"    \"I am,\" the lad replied.    \"Then it is to you I am indebted for my rescue from those who assaulted  me in the streets of Oxford last week. In the confusion I could not see  your face, but I inquired afterward, and was told that my preserver was  Master Furness, and have come over to thank you for your courtesy and  bravery in thus intervening on behalf of one whom I think you regard as  an enemy, for I understand that Sir Henry, your father, has declared for  the crown.\"    \"I acted,\" Harry said, \"simply on the impulse of humanity, and hold it  mean and cowardly for a number of men to fall upon one.\"    \"We are,\" the preacher continued, \"at the beginning only of our  troubles, and the time may come when I, Zachariah Stubbs, may be able to  return to you the good service which you have done me. Believe me, young  sir, the feeling throughout England is strong for the Commons, and that  it will not be crushed out, as some men suppose, even should the king's  men gain a great victory over Essex--which, methinks, is not likely.  There are tens of thousands throughout the country who are now content  to remain quiet at home, who would assuredly draw the sword and go forth  to battle, should they consider their cause in danger. The good work has  begun, and the sword will not be sheathed until the oppressor is laid  low.\"    \"We should differ who the oppressor is,\" Harry replied coldly. \"I  myself am young to discuss these matters, but my father and those who  think with him consider that the oppression is at present on the side of  the Commons, and of those whose religious views you share. While  pretending to wish to be free, you endeavor to bind others beneath your  tyranny. While wishing to worship in your way unmolested, you molest  those who wish to worship in theirs. However, I thank you for your  offer, that should the time come your good services will be at my  disposal. As you say, the issue of the conflict is dark, and it may be,  though I trust it will not, that some day you may, if you will, return  the light service which I rendered you.\"    \"You will not forget my name?\" the preacher said--\"Zachariah Stubbs, a  humble instrument of the Lord, and a preacher in the Independent chapel  at Oxford. Thither I cannot return, and am on my way to London, where I  have many friends, and where I doubt not a charge will be found for me.  I myself belong to the east countries, where the people are strong for  the Lord, and I doubt not that some of those I know will come to the  front of affairs, in which case my influence may perhaps be of more  service than you can suppose at present. Farewell, young sir, and  whatever be the issues of this struggle, I trust that you may safely  emerge from them.\"    The man lifted his broad black hat, and went on his way, and Harry rode  forward, smiling a little to himself at the promise given him.    The time passed slowly, and all kinds of rumors filled the land. At  length beacon fires were seen to blaze upon the hills, and, as it was  known that the Puritans had arranged with Essex that the news of a  victory was so to be conveyed to London, the hearts of the Royalists  sank, for they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11568"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

All Nature beams with such beneficence, and abounds  with such instances of divine love for every creature, however humble:  in observing these provisions, how often are we reminded of the  benefits conferred by the same omniscience upon our own species. It is  thus, by the investigation of natural history, that we are led to  the contemplation of the sublimest subjects; thus that man with God  himself holds converse.      BONE, OR PLATE.      [Illustration: Bone, or Plate.]      The \"bone\" of the Cuttle-fish now claims attention. This is a  complicated calcareous plate, lodged in a peculiar cavity of the back,  which it materially strengthens. This plate has long been known in  the shop of the apothecary under the name of Cuttle-fish bone: an  observant reader may have noticed scores of these plates in glasses  labelled _Os Sepiae_. Reduced to powder, they were formerly used as an  absorbent, but they are now chiefly sought after for the purpose of  polishing the softer metals. It is however improper to call this plate  bone, since, in composition, \"it is exactly similar to _shell_, and  consists of various membranes, hardened by carbonate of lime, (the  principal material of shell,) without the smallest mixture of  phosphate of lime,[13] or the chief material of bone.\"        [12] According to Cuvier, the Indian ink, from China, is made of           this fluid, as was the ink of the Romans. It has been supposed,           and not without a considerable degree of probability, that the           celebrated plain, but wholesome dish, the black broth of Sparta,           was no other than a kind of Cuttle-fish soup, in which the black           liquor of the animal was always added as an ingredient; being,           when fresh, of very agreeable taste.--_Shaw's Zoology_.        [13] Mr. Hatchett, in Philos. Trans.      EGGS.      [Illustration: Eggs.]      Lastly, are the _ovaria_, or egg-bags of the Cuttle-fish, which are  popularly called _sea-grapes_. The female fish deposits her eggs  in numerous clusters, on the stalks of fuci, on corals, about the  projecting sides of rocks, or on any other convenient substances.  These eggs, which are of the size of small filberts, are of a black  colour.    The most remarkable species of Cuttle-fish inhabits the British seas;  and, although seldom taken, its bone or plate is cast ashore on  different parts of the coast from the south of England to the Zetland  Isles. We have picked up scores of these plates and bunches of the  egg-bags or grapes, after rough weather on the beach between Worthing  and Rottingdean; but we never found a single fish.    The Cuttle-fish was esteemed a delicacy by the ancients, and the  moderns equally prize it. Captain Cook speaks highly of a soup he made  from it; and the fish is eaten at the present day by the Italians, and  by the Greeks, during Lent. We take the most edible species to be the  _octopodia_, or eight-armed, found particularly large in the East  Indies and the Gulf of Mexico. The common species here figured, when  full-grown, measures about two feet in length, is of a pale blueish  brown colour, with the skin marked by numerous dark purple specks.    The Cuttle-fish is described by some naturalists, as naked or  shell-less. It is often found attached to the shell of the Paper  Nautilus, which it is said to use as a sail. It is, however, very  doubtful whether the Cuttle-fish has a shell of its own. There is a  controversy upon the subject. Aristotle, and our contemporary, Home,  maintain it to be parasitical: Cuvier and Ferrusac, non-parasitical;  but the curious reader will find the _pro_ and _con._--the majority  and minority--in the _Magazine of Natural History_, vol. iii. p. 535.           *       *       *       *       *          NOTES OF A READER.           *       *       *       *       *    SERVANTS IN INDIA.      [Captain Skinner, in his _Excursions in India_, makes the following  sensible observations on the tyranny over servants in India:]    There are throughout the mountains many of the sacred shrubs of the  Hindoos, which give great delight, as my servants fall in with them.  They pick the leaves; and running with them to me, cry, \"See, sir,  see, our holy plants are here!\" and congratulate each other on having  found some indication of a better land than they are generally  inclined to consider the country of the Pariahs. The happiness these  simple remembrances shed over the whole party is so enlivening, that  every distress and fatigue seems to be forgotten. When we behold a  servant approaching with a sprig of the _Dona_ in his hand, we hail it  as the olive-branch, that denotes peace and good-will for the rest of  the day, if, as must sometimes be the case, they have been in any way  interrupted.    Even these little incidents speak so warmly in favour of the Hindoo  disposition, that, in spite of much that may be uncongenial to an  European in their character, they cannot fail to inspire him with  esteem, if not affection. I wish that many of my countrymen would  learn to believe that the natives are endowed with feelings, and  surely they may gather such an inference from many a similar trait  to the one I have related. Hardness of heart can never be allied  to artless simplicity: that mind must possess a higher degree of  sensibility and refinement, that can unlock its long-confined  recollections by so light a spring as a wild flower.    I have often witnessed, with wonder and sorrow, an English gentleman  stoop to the basest tyranny over his servants, without even the poor  excuse of anger, and frequently from no other reason than because he  could not understand their language. The question, from the answer  being unintelligible, is instantly followed by a blow. Such scenes are  becoming more rare, and indeed are seldom acted but by the younger  members of society; they are too frequent notwithstanding: and should  any thing that has fallen from me here, induce the cruelly-disposed to  reflect a little upon the impropriety and mischief of their conduct,  when about to raise the hand against a native, and save one stripe  to the passive people who are so much at the mercy of their masters'  tempers, I shall indeed be proud.    [Again, speaking of the condition of servants, Captain Skinner  remarks--]    It is impossible to view some members of the despised class without  sorrow and pity, particularly those who are attached, in the lowest  offices, to the establishments of the Europeans. They are the most  melancholy race of beings, always alone, and apparently unhappy: they  are scouted from the presence even of their fellow-servants. None but  the mind of a poet could imagine such outcasts venturing to raise  their thoughts to the beauty of a Brahmin's daughter; and a touching  tale in such creative fancy, no doubt, it would make, for, from their  outward appearances, I do not perceive why they should not be endowed  with minds as sensitive at least as those of the castes above them.  There are among them some very stout and handsome men; and it is  ridiculous to see sometimes all their strength devoted to the charge  of a sickly puppy;--to take care of dogs being their principal  occupation!    Our attention has been drawn to the above passage in Captain Skinner's  work, by its ready illustration of the views and conclusions of the  late Dr. Knox, in his invaluable _Spirit of Despotism_, Section 2,  \"Oriental manners, and the ideas imbibed in youth, both in the East  and West Indies, favourable to the spirit of despotism.\" How forcibly  applicable, on the present occasion, is the following extract:--\"from  the intercourse of England with the East and West Indies, it is to be  feared that something of a more servile spirit has been derived than  was known among those who established the free constitutions of  Europe, and than would have been adopted, or patiently borne, in ages  of virtuous simplicity. A very numerous part of our countrymen spend  their most susceptible age in those countries, where despotic manners  remarkably prevail. They are themselves, when invested with office,  treated by the natives with an idolatrous degree of reverence, which  teaches them to expect a similar submission to their will, on their  return to their own country. They have been accustomed to look up to  personages greatly their superiors in rank and riches, with awe; and  to look down on their inferiors in _property_ with supreme contempt,  as slaves of their will and ministers of their luxury. Equal laws and  equal liberty at home appear to them saucy claims of the poor and the  vulgar, which tend to divest riches of one of the greatest charms,  over-bearing dominion. We do, indeed, import gorgeous silks and  luscious sweets from the Indies, but we import, at the same time, the  spirit of despotism, which adds deformity to the purple robe, and  bitterness to the honied beverage.\" \"That _Oriental_ manners are  unfavourable to liberty, is, I believe, universally conceded. The  natives of the East Indies entertain not the idea of independence.  They treat the Europeans, who go among them to acquire their riches,  with a respect similar to the abject submission which they pay to  their native despots. Young men, who in England scarcely possessed  the rank of the gentry, are waited upon in India, with more attentive  servility than is paid or required in many courts of Europe. Kings of  England seldom assume the state enjoyed by an East India governor, or  even by subordinate officers. Enriched at an early age, the adventurer  returns to England. His property admits him to the higher circles  of fashionable life. He aims at rivalling or excelling all the  old nobility in the splendour of his mansions, the finery of his  carriages, the number of his liveried"]]]
