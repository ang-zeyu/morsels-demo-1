Luckily for  Goa, Faleiro doesn't rule out the possibility of taking  to the pen -- or should one say, the computer keyboard  -- sometime in the near future.    Summer, 1978. Whether Goa's only English daily hit  newsstands in Margao at 9 or at 11 in the morning,  mattered little. I was preparing for my final B.Com.  exams due in a few weeks and had, in any case, tired  myself of asking The Navhind Times' management to make  it a newspaper (for us in South Goa) that went with  breakfast, not brunch.    My association with The Navhind Times (NT) had begun  precisely on February 23, 1975. NT carried an article  penned jointly by D.M. Silveira and me. (Silveira was  one of my two English lecturers at Margao's Damodar College   and, with the other, B.G.Koshy, later turned to  journalism: Silveira was Editor, ONLOOKER, of Mumbai's  FPJ group and Koshy the Associate Ed. of The Current Weekly.)    Then on, the NT Editor, Dr. K.S.K. Menon, encouraged me  to write. Off and on, he would also commission me to do  Sunday features, sometimes full-page, on topics of  prevailing reader interest. Between 1975 and 1978, I  had some 45 by-lines at the NT, then a 6-pager (10  pages on Sunday.)    Sometime in between, Dr. K.S.K. asked me to join the NT  desk -- with free education at Dempo College of Commerce   and no-night-shifts baits. I ought to have grabbed the  offer. The company was great: K.P. Nair (News Ed), the  incredibly witty Balan (Chief Sub), my friend Patrick Michael   (a gifted Malayalee who, with me, but surreptitiously,  covered North Goa for The Current Weekly -- together we  had done the Siddarth Bandodkar shooting story, but who K.S.K.   ensured stayed as Proof Reader without promotion at  the NT!) Gabru and Cyril D'Cunha were at the desk and  Gurudas R. (\"Kaka\") Singbal, Pramod Khandeparkar and  Jovito Lopes on the field?    For reasons that will take me off this track, I  declined the offer. Promising Dr. K.S.K., however, that  I'd join the day I complete graduation -- though I  never really meant to take journalism as a career. I  had set my sights on becoming a Company Secretary after  B.Com. but while doing the correspondence course,  thought I'd work -- and earn pocket money.    The '70s were times of MRTP culture. There were  monopolies and there were restrictive trade practices,  and Commissions that could barely hold them in check.  Even though Dr. K.S.K. to my sheer amazement once  bragged that the Prime Minister's private secretary  telephoned him while he was shaving just that morning  (to compliment him on the day's \"excellent\" editorial),  fact was that NT rarely traveled 35 kilometres to Margao   before 8 or 9 in the morning. Times wouldn't change  and the NT stood still. It was a proud monopoly, which,  after all, had weathered challenges from the likes of  Goa Monitor (Papa Baba Sequeira-owned, Jagdish Rao  -published, Mario Cabral Sa-edited and Alfred De Tavares  -chief reported.)    Back to the summer of 1978. As our 'unholy trinity' of  Aleixo, Shekhar and me daily sat at the Govind Poy  house on Abade Faria Road, Margao, preparing for our  final B.Com. exams, I missed Kaka Singbal -- a.k.a.  Balsing, the Sunday columnist and Chief Reporter of NT  -- and Sripad P. Madkaikar, who at one time or the  other published most of Goa's dailies. Both had called  at home earlier in the day. Kaka left a note saying he  had something \"interesting\" for me and would I kindly  see him soon. I met him at his Patto quarters early  next morning. He said he had quit NT and joined a  newspaper that was going to be published -- from  Margao! He said the proprietor, Panduronga (Chalebab) Timblo   -- Papa to most of us -- had made a blanket offer:  whatever the NT offered me, he would offer more!    I immediately went to Navhind Bhavan. Dr. K.S.K. was  seated with Fr. Lactancio Almeida, then Editor of  Vauraddeancho Ixtt. I explained that it would help me  cope with my Company Secretary studies from the  comforts of my own home in Margao? The ex-Army man  perennially dressed in cool white almost sprang from  the chair, his neatly waxed whiskers bristling with  rage: \"Are you going to that W.C. s**t Times?\"    He tried a different line, \"Are you going to join my  competitor and stab me in the chest?\" And yet another,  \"Remember I am the P.A.C. (Press Advisory Committee)  chairman for another three years -- and as long as I'm  around, I'll ensure you don't get an accreditation!!\"    I was painfully aware that I was reneging on a promise,  that by joining a competitor, I'd hurt the hand that  had, in good measure, groomed me. But Company  Secretaryship was my object -- not journalism -- and I  honestly imagined that studying the course material and  sending out its Response Sheets would be better done  from home and without working on shifts, as I'd at NT.  [I was, eventually, recompensed with poetic justice. I  hadn't reckoned that joining a fledgling -- nay,  nascent -- publication as its Staff Reporter, with  added responsibility of news-gathering in South Goa  (which meant re-writing copy from mofussil  correspondents who largely hailed from a vernacular  background) would be so engrossing an affair that I  ended up sending not a single Response Sheet to the  Institute of Company Secretaries of India!]    The West Coast Times (WCT) began churning out dummies  by late-June 1978. My die was cast on June 6, 1978, by  way of acceptance of the appointment letter, personally  signed by Papa (Panduronga Timblo) himself. One of the  most promising publishing ventures in the history of  Goa's print media was about to take off?    The mid-'70s witnessed a boom in Goa's mining industry,  both in terms of productivity and profitability.  Panduronga Timblo Industrias (PTI) had evidently also  made pots of cash, particularly from its manganese  mines in Rivona, Quepem. While brother, Gurudas' Timblo  Private Limited (TPL) had during this time invested in  some far-sighted (but alas, badly managed) industrial  enterprises, including fertilizers, rubber footwear and  collapsible tubes, youngest brother, Modu's Sociedade  de Fomento Industrial (SFI) was consolidating its  strengths in mining and diversifying into hospitality.  PTI did not lag behind -- with Parshuram Paper Mills at  Chiplun, industrial gases in Bangalore and, to the  surprise of many, an English-language newspaper from Margao!     A rival to Hobson's choice NT    The last comment may be off the mark. As I later learnt  from Papa himself, the project was conceived from a  broader vision. Throughout the Konkan, from Ratnagiri district   in Maharashtra to South Canara (now Dakshin Kannada)  districts in Karnataka, no English-language daily was  available before noon or afternoon those days. While  the Mumbai dak editions of Times of India (ToI) and  Indian Express (IE) did the honours in coastal  Maharashtra, it was Bangalore's Deccan Herald in  coastal Karnataka. Goa's NT, which took only a couple  of hours less to reach Margao, could not be expected to  travel beyond its borders on mass circulation basis --  till WCT arrived, NT was in fact believed to have  pegged its circulation (to avoid re-classification to a  higher bracket, which implied higher minimum wages to  staff and workers!)    It was Papa's dream to fill this void of a morning  English-language daily for the entire Konkan, from Goa.  Hence the West Coast in the newspaper's name.  Competition to NT was only incidental. (I am not aware  of any family feuds among Goa's mining magnates at the  time and shall stand corrected if there was any such  raison d' etat. If there really were any differences  between the two families, they would be buried some  years later: under blessings of the Partagal Swamiji,  Papa's grand-daughter, Pallavi, was given in marriage  to the Dempo headman, Vasantrao's son, Srinivas -  current Chairman of the Dempo group.)    The infrastructure put into place to realize Papa's  dream matched. A modern civil construction,  meticulously designed, was put up at Davorlim, just  beyond Margao's municipal boundary. Editorial,  advertising and printing departments were housed under  one roof for optimum synch. All sections of the  newspaper's production process, from subbing to  typesetting, from proof reading to optical processing,  from plate-making to the final printing, were so  located as to achieve maximum production speed.  Attention was paid even to minor details, like sending  galley proofs to the news desk in a jiffy. Such were  the conveniences that the edition could go to bed by a  leisurely 4.30am (the print run took barely half an  hour.) Communication lines were made as reliable as  possible, given frequent power interruptions. Both PTI  and UNI ticker services were subscribed to (though only  the PTI had a carrier station in Margao to cope with  breakdowns.) A full-fledged bureau was set up in  Panjim, connected to the editorial offices in Davorlim  by teleprinter link.    The printing technology employed was said to be the  best available in India -- except in typesetting, where  for some unknown reason, Lino machines were used  instead of computers (maybe the value of lead scrap, in  place of katchra bromides that computers generated  those days, had something to do with it!) No more  block-making for photographs and illustrations; these  were optically processed directly to printing plates. A  modern web offset printing machine was brought in  (together with a Delhi-based Haryanvi operator who soon  acquired fondness for palm feni from nearby Jose's bar  and other unprintables from across the Rawanfond  railway tracks!). The machine churned out,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11533"],[0,"Theocritus, translated into English Verse (#5)"],[1,"         Ay, you hail him.        LACON.              Friend, 'twill not take thee long:      We're striving which is master, we twain, in woodland song:      And thou, my good friend Morson, ne'er look with favouring eyes      On me; nor yet to yonder lad be fain to judge the prize.        COMETAS.      Nay, by the Nymphs, sweet Morson, ne'er for Cometas' sake      Stretch thou a point; nor e'er let him undue advantage take.      Sibyrtas owns yon wethers; a Thurian is he:      And here, my friend, Eumares' goats, of Sybaris, you may see.        LACON.      And who asked thee, thou naughty knave, to whom belonged these flocks,      Sibyrtas, or (it might be) me? Eh, thou'rt a chatter-box!        COMETAS.      The simple truth, most worshipful, is all that I allege:      I'm not for boasting. But thy wit hath all too keen an edge.        LACON.      Come sing, if singing's in thee--and may our friend get back      To town alive! Heaven help us, lad, how thy tongue doth clack!        COMETAS. [_Sings_]      Daphnis the mighty minstrel was less precious to the Nine      Than I. I offered yesterday two kids upon their shrine.        LACON. [_Sings_]      Ay, but Apollo fancies me hugely: for him I rear      A lordly ram: and, look you, the Carnival is near.        COMETAS.      Twin kids hath every goat I milk, save two. My maid, my own,      Eyes me and asks 'At milking time, rogue, art thou all alone?'        LACON.      Go to! nigh twenty baskets doth Lacon fill with cheese:      Hath time to woo a sweetheart too upon the blossomed leas.        COMETAS.      Clarissa pelts her goatherd with apples, should he stray      By with his goats; and pouts her lip in a quaint charming way.        LACON.      Me too a darling smooth of face notes as I tend my flocks:      How maddeningly o'er that fair neck ripple those shining locks!        COMETAS.      Tho' dogrose and anemone are fair in their degree,      The rose that blooms by garden-walls still is the rose for me.        LACON.      Tho' acorns' cups are fair, their taste is bitterness, and still      I'll choose, for honeysweet are they, the apples of the hill.        COMETAS.      A cushat I will presently procure and give to her      Who loves me: I know where it sits; up in the juniper.        LACON.      Pooh! a soft fleece, to make a coat, I'll give the day I shear      My brindled ewe--(no hand but mine shall touch it)--to my dear.        COMETAS.      Back, lambs, from that wild-olive: and be content to browse      Here on the shoulder of the hill, beneath the myrtle boughs.        LACON.      Run, (will ye?) Ball and Dogstar, down from that oak tree, run:      And feed where Spot is feeding, and catch the morning sun.        COMETAS.      I have a bowl of cypress-wood: I have besides a cup:      Praxiteles designed them: for _her_ they're treasured up.        LACON.      I have a dog who throttles wolves: he loves the sheep, and they      Love him: I'll give him to my dear, to keep wild beasts at bay.        COMETAS.      Ye locusts that o'erleap my fence, oh let my vines escape      Your clutches, I beseech you: the bloom is on the grape.        LACON.      Ye crickets, mark how nettled our friend the goatherd is!      I ween, ye cost the reapers pangs as acute as his.        COMETAS.      Those foxes with their bushy tails, I hate to see them crawl      Round Micon's homestead and purloin his grapes at evenfall.        LACON.      _I_ hate to see the beetles that come warping on the wind.      And climb Philondas' trees, and leave never a fig behind.        COMETAS.      Have you forgot that cudgelling I gave you? At each stroke      You grinned and twisted with a grace, and clung to yonder oak.        LACON.      That I've forgot--but I have not, how once Eumares tied      You to that selfsame oak-trunk, and tanned your unclean hide.        COMETAS.      There's some one ill--of heartburn. You note it, I presume,      Morson? Go quick, and fetch a squill from some old beldam's tomb.        LACON.      I think I'm stinging somebody, as Morson too perceives--      Go to the river and dig up a clump of sowbread-leaves.        COMETAS.      May Himera flow, not water, but milk: and may'st thou blush,      Crathis, with wine; and fruitage grow upon every rush.        LACON.      For me may Sybaris' fountain flow, pure honey: so that you,      My fair, may dip your pitcher each morn in honey-dew.        COMETAS.      My goats are fed on clover and goat's-delight: they tread      On lentisk leaves; or lie them down, ripe strawberries o'er their head.        LACON.      My sheep crop honeysuckle bloom, while all around them blows      In clusters rich the jasmine, as brave as any rose.        COMETAS.      I scorn my maid; for when she took my cushat, she did not      Draw with both hands my face to hers and kiss me on the spot.        LACON.      I love my love, and hugely: for, when I gave my flute,      I was rewarded with a kiss, a loving one to boot.        COMETAS.      Lacon, the nightingale should scarce be challenged by the jay,      Nor swan by hoopoe: but, poor boy, thou aye wert for a fray.        MORSON.      I bid the shepherd hold his peace. Cometas, unto you      I, Morson, do adjudge the lamb. You'll first make offering due      Unto the nymphs: then savoury meat you'll send to Morson too.        COMETAS.      By Pan I will! Snort, all my herd of he-goats: I shall now      O'er Lacon, shepherd as he is, crow ye shall soon see how.      I've won, and I could leap sky-high! Ye also dance and skip,      My horned ewes: in Sybaris' fount to-morrow all shall dip.      Ho! you, sir, with the glossy coat and dangerous crest; you dare      Look at a ewe, till I have slain my lamb, and ill you'll fare.      What! is he at his tricks again? He is, and he will get      (Or my name's not Cometas) a proper pounding yet.          IDYLL VI.      The Drawn Battle.    DAPHNIS. DAMOETAS.        Daphnis the herdsman and Damoetas once      Had driven, Aratus, to the selfsame glen.      One chin was yellowing, one shewed half a beard.      And by a brookside on a summer noon      The pair sat down and sang; but Daphnis led      The song, for Daphnis was the challenger.        DAPHNIS.      \"See! Galatea pelts thy flock with fruit,      And calls their master 'Lack-love,' Polypheme.      Thou mark'st her not, blind, blind, but pipest aye      Thy wood-notes. See again, she smites thy dog:      Sea-ward the fleeced flocks' sentinel peers and barks,      And, through the clear wave visible to her still,      Careers along the gently babbling beach.      Look that he leap not on the maid new-risen      From her sea-bath and rend her dainty limbs.      She fools thee, near or far, like thistle-waifs      In hot sweet summer: flies from thee when wooed,      Unwooed pursues thee: risks all moves to win;      For, Polypheme, things foul seem fair to Love.\"          And then, due prelude made, Damoetas sang.        DAMOETAS.      \"I marked her pelt my dog, I was not blind,      By Pan, by this my one my precious eye      That bounds my vision now and evermore!      But Telemus the Seer, be his the woe,      His and his children's, that he promised me!      Yet do I too tease her; I pass her by,      Pretend to woo another:--and she hears      (Heaven help me!) and is faint with jealousy;      And hurrying from the sea-wave as if stung,      Scans with keen glance my grotto and my flock.      'Twas I hissed on the dog to bark at her;      For, when I loved her, he would whine and lay      His muzzle in her lap. These things she'll note      Mayhap, and message send on message soon:      But I will bar my door until she swear      To make me on this isle fair bridal-bed.      And I am less unlovely than men say.      I looked into the mere (the mere was calm),      And goodly seemed my beard, and goodly seemed      My solitary eye, and, half-revealed,      My teeth gleamed whiter than the Parian marl.      Thrice for good luck I spat upon my robe:      That learned I of the hag Cottytaris--her      Who fluted lately with Hippocooen's mowers.\"          Damoetas then kissed Daphnis lovingly:      One gave a pipe and one a goodly flute.      Straight to the shepherd's flute and herdsman's pipe      The younglings bounded in the soft green grass:      And neither was o'ermatched, but matchless both.          IDYLL VII.      Harvest-Home.        Once on a time did Eucritus and I      (With us Amyntas) to the riverside      Steal from the city. For Lycopeus' sons      Were that day busy with the harvest-home,      Antigenes and Phrasidemus, sprung      (If aught thou holdest by the good old names)      By Clytia from great Chalcon--him who erst      Planted one stalwart knee against the rock,      And lo, beneath his foot Burine's rill      Brake forth, and at its side poplar and elm      Shewed aisles of pleasant shadow, greenly roofed      By tufted leaves. Scarce midway were we now,      Nor yet descried the tomb of Brasilas:      When, thanks be to the Muses, there drew near      A wayfarer from Crete, young Lycidas.      The horned herd was his care: a glance might tell      So much: for every inch a herdsman he.      Slung o'er his shoulder was a ruddy hide      Torn from a he-goat, shaggy, tangle-haired,      That reeked of rennet yet: a broad belt clasped      A patched cloak round his breast, and for a staff      A gnarled wild-olive bough his right hand bore.      Soon with a quiet smile he spoke--his eye      Twinkled, and laughter sat upon his lip:      \"And whither ploddest thou thy weary way      Beneath the noontide sun, Simichidas?      For now the lizard sleeps upon the wall,      The crested lark folds now his wandering wing.      Dost speed, a bidden guest, to some reveller's board?      Or townward to the treading of the grape?      For lo! recoiling from thy hurrying feet      The pavement-stones ring out right merrily.\"      Then I: \"Friend Lycid, all"]]]
