II.--Among the Helvetii, Orgetorix was by far the most distinguished and  wealthy. He, when Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso were consuls, incited  by lust of sovereignty, formed a conspiracy among the nobility, and  persuaded the people to go forth from their territories with all their  possessions, [saying] that it would be very easy, since they excelled  all in valour, to acquire the supremacy of the whole of Gaul. To this he  the more easily persuaded them, because the Helvetii are confined on  every side by the nature of their situation; on one side by the Rhine, a  very broad and deep river, which separates the Helvetian territory from  the Germans; on a second side by the Jura, a very high mountain which is  [situated] between the Sequani and the Helvetii; on a third by the Lake  of Geneva, and by the river Rhone, which separates our Province from the  Helvetii. From these circumstances it resulted that they could range  less widely, and could less easily make war upon their neighbours; for  which reason men fond of war [as they were] were affected with great  regret. They thought, that considering the extent of their population,  and their renown for warfare and bravery, they had but narrow limits,  although they extended in length 240, and in breadth 180 [Roman] miles.    III.--Induced by these considerations, and influenced by the authority  of Orgetorix, they determined to provide such things as were necessary  for their expedition--to buy up as great a number as possible of beasts  of burden and waggons--to make their sowings as large as possible, so  that on their march plenty of corn might be in store--and to establish  peace and friendship with the neighbouring states. They reckoned that a  term of two years would be sufficient for them to execute their designs;  they fix by decree their departure for the third year. Orgetorix is  chosen to complete these arrangements. He took upon himself the office  of ambassador to the states: on this journey he persuades Casticus, the  son of Catamantaledes (one of the Sequani, whose father had possessed  the sovereignty among the people for many years, and had been styled  \"_friend_\" by the senate of the Roman people), to seize upon the  sovereignty in his own state, which his father had held before him, and  he likewise persuades Dumnorix, an Aeduan, the brother of Divitiacus,  who at that time possessed the chief authority in the state, and was  exceedingly beloved by the people, to attempt the same, and gives him  his daughter in marriage. He proves to them that to accomplish their  attempts was a thing very easy to be done, because he himself would  obtain the government of his own state; that there was no doubt that the  Helvetii were the most powerful of the whole of Gaul; he assures them  that he will, with his own forces and his own army, acquire the  sovereignty for them. Incited by this speech, they give a pledge and  oath to one another, and hope that, when they have seized the  sovereignty, they will, by means of the three most powerful and valiant  nations, be enabled to obtain possession of the whole of Gaul.    IV.--When this scheme was disclosed to the Helvetii by informers, they,  according to their custom, compelled Orgetorix to plead his cause in  chains; it was the law that the penalty of being burned by fire should  await him if condemned. On the day appointed for the pleading of his  cause, Orgetorix drew together from all quarters to the court all his  vassals to the number of ten thousand persons; and led together to the  same place, and all his dependants and debtor-bondsmen, of whom he had a  great number; by means of these he rescued himself from [the necessity  of] pleading his cause. While the state, incensed at this act, was  endeavouring to assert its right by arms, and the magistrates were  mustering a large body of men from the country, Orgetorix died; and  there is not wanting a suspicion, as the Helvetii think, of his having  committed suicide.    V.--After his death, the Helvetii nevertheless attempt to do that which  they had resolved on, namely, to go forth from their territories. When  they thought that they were at length prepared for this undertaking,  they set fire to all their towns, in number about twelve--to their  villages about four hundred--and to the private dwellings that remained;  they burn up all the corn, except what they intend to carry with them;  that after destroying the hope of a return home, they might be the more  ready for undergoing all dangers. They order every one to carry forth  from home for himself provisions for three months, ready ground. They  persuade the Rauraci, and the Tulingi, and the Latobrigi, their  neighbours, to adopt the same plan, and after burning down their towns  and villages, to set out with them: and they admit to their party and  unite to themselves as confederates the Boii, who had dwelt on the other  side of the Rhine, and had crossed over into the Norican territory, and  assaulted Noreia.    VI.--There were in all two routes by which they could go forth from  their country--one through the Sequani, narrow and difficult, between  Mount Jura and the river Rhone (by which scarcely one waggon at a time  could be led; there was, moreover, a very high mountain overhanging, so  that a very few might easily intercept them); the other, through our  Province, much easier and freer from obstacles, because the Rhone flows  between the boundaries of the Helvetii and those of the Allobroges, who  had lately been subdued, and is in some places crossed by a ford. The  furthest town of the Allobroges, and the nearest to the territories of  the Helvetii, is Geneva. From this town a bridge extends to the  Helvetii. They thought that they should either persuade the Allobroges,  because they did not seem as yet well-affected towards the Roman people,  or compel them by force to allow them to pass through their territories.  Having provided everything for the expedition, they appoint a day on  which they should all meet on the bank of the Rhone. This day was the  fifth before the kalends of April [_i.e._ the 28th of March], in the  consulship of Lucius Piso and Aulus Gabinius [B.C. 58].    VII.--When it was reported to Caesar that they were attempting to make  their route through our Province, he hastens to set out from the city,  and, by as great marches as he can, proceeds to Further Gaul, and  arrives at Geneva. He orders the whole Province [to furnish] as great a  number of soldiers as possible, as there was in all only one legion in  Further Gaul: he orders the bridge at Geneva to be broken down. When the  Helvetii are apprised of his arrival, they send to him, as ambassadors,  the most illustrious men of their state (in which embassy Numeius and  Verudoctius held the chief place), to say \"that it was their intention  to march through the Province without doing any harm, because they had\"  [according to their own representations] \"no other route:--that they  requested they might be allowed to do so with his consent.\" Caesar,  inasmuch as he kept in remembrance that Lucius Cassius, the consul, had  been slain, and his army routed and made to pass under the yoke by the  Helvetii, did not think that [their request] ought to be granted; nor  was he of opinion that men of hostile disposition, if an opportunity of  marching through the Province were given them, would abstain from  outrage and mischief. Yet, in order that a period might intervene, until  the soldiers whom he had ordered [to be furnished] should assemble, he  replied to the ambassadors, that he would take time to deliberate; if  they wanted anything, they might return on the day before the ides of  April [on April 12th].    VIII.--Meanwhile, with the legion which he had with him and the soldiers  who had assembled from the Province, he carries along for nineteen  [Roman, not quite eighteen English] miles a wall, to the height of  sixteen feet, and a trench, from the lake of Geneva, which flows into  the river Rhone, to Mount Jura, which separates the territories of the  Sequani from those of the Helvetii. When that work was finished, he  distributes garrisons, and closely fortifies redoubts, in order that he  may the more easily intercept them, if they should attempt to cross over  against his will. When the day which he had appointed with the  ambassadors came, and they returned to him, he says that he cannot,  consistently with the custom and precedent of the Roman people, grant  any one a passage through the Province; and he gives them to understand  that, if they should attempt to use violence, he would oppose them. The  Helvetii, disappointed in this hope, tried if they could force a passage  (some by means of a bridge of boats and numerous rafts constructed for  the purpose; others, by the fords of the Rhone, where the depth of the  river was least, sometimes by day, but more frequently by night), but  being kept at bay by the strength of our works, and by the concourse of  the soldiers, and by the missiles, they desisted from this attempt.    IX.--There was left one way, [namely] through the Sequani, by which, on  account of its narrowness, they could not pass without the consent of  the Sequani. As they could not of themselves prevail on them, they send  ambassadors to Dumnorix the Aeduan, that through his intercession they  might obtain their request from the Sequani. Dumnorix, by his popularity  and liberality, had great influence among the Sequani, and was friendly  to the Helvetii, because out of that state he had married the daughter  of Orgetorix; and, incited by lust of sovereignty, was anxious for a  revolution, and wished to have as many states as possible attached to  him by his kindness towards them. He, therefore, undertakes the affair,  and prevails upon the Sequani to allow the Helvetii to march through  their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10661"],[0,"A Selection from the Discourses of Epictetus with the Encheiridion (#5)"],[1,"to the  size of your body, as an athlete, for a man ought not to be invincible  in the way that an ass is.           *       *       *       *       *    HOW WE SHOULD BEHAVE TO TYRANTS.--If a man possesses any superiority, or  thinks that he does when he does not, such a man, if he is uninstructed,  will of necessity be puffed up through it. For instance, the tyrant  says, I am master of all! And what can you do for me? Can you give me  desire which shall have no hindrance? How can you? Have you the  infallible power of avoiding what you would avoid? Have you the power of  moving towards an object without error? And how do you possess this  power? Come, when you are in a ship, do you trust to yourself or to the  helmsman? And when you are in a chariot, to whom do you trust but to the  driver? And how is it in all other arts? Just the same. In what, then,  lies your power? All men pay respect to me. Well, I also pay respect to  my platter, and I wash it and wipe it; and for the sake of my oil-flask,  I drive a peg into the wall. Well, then, are these things superior to  me? No, but they supply some of my wants, and for this reason I take  care of them. Well, do I not attend to my ass? Do I not wash his feet?  Do I not clean him? Do you not know that every man has regard to  himself, and to you just the same as he has regard to his ass? For who  has regard to you as a man? Show me. Who wishes to become like you? Who  imitates you, as he imitates Socrates? But I can cut off your head. You  say right. I had forgotten that I must have regard to you, as I would to  a fever and the bile, and raise an altar to you, as there is at Rome an  altar to fever.    What is it then that disturbs and terrifies the multitude? Is it the  tyrant and his guards? (By no means.) I hope that it is not so. It is  not possible that what is by nature free can be disturbed by anything  else, or hindered by any other thing than by itself. But it is a man's  own opinions which disturb him. For when the tyrant says to a man, I  will chain your leg, he who values his leg says, Do not; have pity. But  he who values his own will says, If it appears more advantageous to you,  chain it. Do you not care? I do not care. I will show you that I am  master. You cannot do that. Zeus has set me free; do you think that he  intended to allow his own son to be enslaved? But you are master of my  carcase; take it. So when you approach me, you have no regard to me? No,  but I have regard to myself; and if you wish me to say that I have  regard to you also, I tell you that I have the same regard to you that I  have to my pipkin.    What then? When absurd notions about things independent of our will, as  if they were good and (or) bad, lie at the bottom of our opinions, we  must of necessity pay regard to tyrants: for I wish that men would pay  regard to tyrants only, and not also to the bedchamber men. How is it  that the man becomes all at once wise, when Caesar has made him  superintendent of the close stool? How is it that we say immediately,  Felicion spoke sensibly to me? I wish he were ejected from the  bedchamber, that he might again appear to you to be a fool.    Has a man been exalted to the tribuneship? All who meet him offer their  congratulations; one kisses his eyes, another the neck, and the slaves  kiss his hands. He goes to his house, he finds torches lighted. He  ascends the Capitol; he offers a sacrifice on the occasion. Now who ever  sacrificed for having had good desires? for having acted conformably to  nature? For in fact we thank the gods for those things in which we place  our good.    A person was talking to me to-day about the priesthood of Augustus. I  say to him: Man, let the thing alone; you will spend much for no  purpose. But he replies, Those who draw up agreements will write my  name. Do you then stand by those who read them, and say to such persons,  It is I whose name is written there? And if you can now be present on  ail such occasions, what will you do when you are dead? My name will  remain. Write it on a stone, and it will remain. But come, what  remembrance of you will there be beyond Nicopolis? But I shall wear a  crown of gold. If you desire a crown at all, take a crown of roses and  put it on, for it will be more elegant in appearance.           *       *       *       *       *    AGAINST THOSE WHO WISH TO BE ADMIRED.--When a man holds his proper  station in life, he does not gape after things beyond it. Man, what do  you wish to happen to you? I am satisfied if I desire and avoid  conformably to nature, if I employ movements towards and from an object  as I am by nature formed to do, and purpose and design and assent. Why  then do you strut before us as if you had swallowed a spit? My wish has  always been that those who meet me should admire me, and those who  follow me should exclaim, O the great philosopher! Who are they by whom  you wish to be admired? Are they not those of whom you are used to say  that they are mad? Well, then, do you wish to be admired by madmen?           *       *       *       *       *    ON PRAECOGNITIONS.--Praecognitions are common to all men, and praecognition  is not contradictory to praecognition. For who of us does not assume that  Good is useful and eligible, and in all circumstances that we ought to  follow and pursue it? And who of us does not assume that Justice is  beautiful and becoming? When then does the contradiction arise? It  arises in the adaptation of the praecognitions to the particular cases.  When one man says, \"He has done well; he is a brave man,\" and another  says, \"Not so; but he has acted foolishly,\" then the disputes arise  among men. This is the dispute among the Jews and the Syrians and the  Egyptians and the Romans; not whether holiness should be preferred to  all things and in all cases should be pursued, but whether it is holy to  eat pig's flesh or not holy. You will find this dispute also between  Agamemnon and Achilles; for call them forth. What do you say, Agamemnon?  ought not that to be done which is proper and right? \"Certainly.\" Well,  what do you say, Achilles? do you not admit that what is good ought to  be done? \"I do most certainly.\" Adapt your praecognitions then to the  present matter. Here the dispute begins. Agamemnon says, \"I ought not to  give up Chryseis to her father.\" Achilles says, \"You ought.\" It is  certain that one of the two makes a wrong adaptation of the praecognition  of \"ought\" or \"duty.\" Further, Agamemnon says, \"Then if I ought to  restore Chryseis, it is fit that I take his prize from some of you.\"  Achilles replies, \"Would you then take her whom I love?\" \"Yes, her whom  you love.\" \"Must I then be the only man who goes without a prize? and  must I be the only man who has no prize?\" Thus the dispute begins.    What then is education? Education is the learning how to adapt the  natural praecognitions to the particular things conformably to nature;  and then to distinguish that of things some are in our power, but others  are not. In our power are will and all acts which depend on the will;  things not in our power are the body, the parts of the body,  possessions, parents, brothers, children, country, and, generally, all  with whom we live in society. In what then should we place the good? To  what kind of things ([Greek: ousia]) shall we adapt it? To the things  which are in our power? Is not health then a good thing, and soundness  of limb, and life, and are not children and parents and country? Who  will tolerate you if you deny this?    Let us then transfer the notion of good to these things. Is it possible,  then, when a man sustains damage and does not obtain good things, that  he can be happy? It is not possible. And can he maintain towards society  a proper behavior? He can not. For I am naturally formed to look after  my own interest. If it is my interest to have an estate in land, it is  my interest also to take it from my neighbor. If it is my interest to  have a garment, it is my interest also to steal it from the bath. This  is the origin of wars, civil commotions, tyrannies, conspiracies. And  how shall I be still able to maintain my duty towards Zeus? For if I  sustain damage and am unlucky, he takes no care of me. And what is he to  me if he cannot help me? And further, what is he to me if he allows me  to be in the condition in which I am? I now begin to hate him. Why then  do we build temples, why setup statues to Zeus, as well as to evil  demons, such as to Fever; and how is Zeus the Saviour, and how the giver  of rain, and the giver of fruits? And in truth if we place the nature of  Good in any such things, all this follows.    What should we do then? This is the inquiry of the true philosopher who  is in labor. Now I do not see what the good is nor the bad. Am I not  mad? Yes. But suppose that I place the good somewhere among the things  which depend on the will; all will laugh at me. There will come some  greyhead wearing many gold rings on his fingers, and he will shake his  head and say: \"Hear, my child. It is right that you should philosophize;  but you ought to have some brains also; all this that you are doing is  silly. You learn the syllogism from philosophers; but you know how to  act better than philosophers do.\" Man why then do you blame me, if I  know? What shall I say to this slave? If I am silent, he will burst. I  must speak in this way: \"Excuse me, as you would excuse lovers; I am not  my own master; I am mad.\"           *       *       *       *       *    HOW WE SHOULD STRUGGLE WITH CIRCUMSTANCES.--It is circumstances  (difficulties) which show what men are. Therefore when a difficulty  falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has  matched you with a rough young man. For what purpose? you may say. Why,  that you may become an Olympic conqueror; but it is not accomplished  without sweat. In my opinion no man has had a more profitable difficulty  than"]]]
