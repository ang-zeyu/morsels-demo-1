My own inclination would lead me to say as little as possible about  myself; but several friends, in whose judgment I have confidence, have  suggested that, as the reader likes to know something about the author,  a short account of his origin and early life would lend additional  interest to this book. Such is my excuse for the following egotism; and,  if an apology be necessary for giving a genealogy, I find it in the fact  that it is not very long, and contains only one incident of which I have  reason to be proud.    Our great-grandfather fell at the battle of Culloden, fighting for the  old line of kings; and our grandfather was a small farmer in Ulva,  where my father was born. It is one of that cluster of the Hebrides thus  alluded to by Walter Scott:       \"And Ulva dark, and Colonsay,     And all the group of islets gay     That guard famed Staffa round.\"*       * Lord of the Isles, canto 4.    Our grandfather was intimately acquainted with all the traditionary  legends which that great writer has since made use of in the \"Tales of a  Grandfather\" and other works. As a boy I remember listening to him with  delight, for his memory was stored with a never-ending stock of stories,  many of which were wonderfully like those I have since heard while  sitting by the African evening fires. Our grandmother, too, used to  sing Gaelic songs, some "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10430"],[0,"Trips to the Moon (#5)"],[1,"ans, you must know, will always have a little struggle with  Thucydides, though he had nothing to do with the war in Armenia; our  writer, therefore, after burying Severian most magnificently, places  at his sepulchre one Afranius Silo, a centurion, the rival of  Pericles, who spoke so fine a declamation upon him as, by heaven,  made me laugh till I cried again, particularly when the orator  seemed deeply afflicted, and with tears in his eyes, lamented the  sumptuous entertainments and drinking bouts which he should no more  partake of.  To crown all with an imitation of Ajax, {42} the orator  draws his sword, and, as it became the noble Afranius, before all  the assembly, kills himself at the tomb.  So Mars defend me! but he  deserved to die much sooner for making such a declamation.  When  those, says he, who were present beheld this, they were filled with  admiration, and beyond measure extolled Afranius.  For my own part,  I pitied him for the loss of the cakes and dishes which he so  lamented, and only blamed him for not destroying the writer of the  history before he made an end of himself.    Others there are who, from ignorance and want of skill, not knowing  what should be mentioned, and what passed over in silence, entirely  omit or slightly run through things of the greatest consequence, and  most worthy of attention, whilst they most copiously describe and  dwell upon trifles; which is just as absurd as it would be not to  take notice of or admire the wonderful beauty of the Olympian  Jupiter, {43} and at the same time to be lavish in our praises of  the fine polish, workmanship, and proportion of the base and  pedestal.    I remember one of these who despatches the battle at Europus in  seven lines, and spends some hundreds in a long frigid narration,  that is nothing to the purpose, showing how \"a certain Moorish  cavalier, wandering on the mountains in search of water, lit on some  Syrian rustics, who helped him to a dinner; how they were afraid of  him at first, but afterwards became intimately acquainted with him,  and received him with hospitality; for one of them, it seems, had  been in Mauritania, where his brother bore arms.\"  Then follows a  long tale, \"how he hunted in Mauritania, and saw several elephants  feeding together; how he had like to have been devoured by a lion;  and how many fish he bought at Caesarea.\"  This admirable historian  takes no notice of the battle, the attacks or defences, the truces,  the guards on each side, or anything else; but stands from morning  to night looking upon Malchion, the Syrian, who buys cheap fish at  Caesarea:  if night had not come on, I suppose he would have supped  there, as the chars {44} were ready.  If these things had not been  carefully recorded in the history we should have been sadly in the  dark, and the Romans would have had an insufferable loss, if  Mausacas, the thirsty Moor, could have found nothing to drink, or  returned to the camp without his supper; not to mention here, what  is still more ridiculous, as how \"a piper came up to them out of the  neighbouring village, and how they made presents to each other,  Mausacas giving Malchion a spear, and Malchion presenting Mausacas  with a buckle.\"  Such are the principal occurrences in the history  of the battle of Europus.  One may truly say of such writers that  they never saw the roses on the tree, but took care to gather the  prickles that grew at the bottom of it.    Another of them, who had never set a foot out of Corinth, or seen  Syria or Armenia, begins thus:  \"It is better to trust our eyes than  our ears; I write, therefore, what I have seen, and not what I have  heard;\" he saw everything so extremely well that he tells us, \"the  Parthian dragons (which amongst them signifies no more than a great  number, {45} for one dragon brings a thousand) are live serpents of  a prodigious size, that breed in Persia, a little above Iberia; that  these are lifted up on long poles, and spread terror to a great  distance; and that when the battle begins, they let them loose on  the enemy.\"  Many of our soldiers, he tells us, were devoured by  them, and a vast number pressed to death by being locked in their  embraces:  this he beheld himself from the top of a high tree, to  which he had retired for safety.  Well it was for us that he so  prudently determined not to come nigh them; we might otherwise have  lost this excellent writer, who with his own brave hand performed  such feats in this battle; for he went through many dangers, and was  wounded somewhere about Susa, I suppose, in his journey from Cranium  to Lerna.  All this he recited to the Corinthians, who very well  knew that he had never so much as seen a view of this battle painted  on a wall; neither did he know anything of arms, or military  machines, the method of disposing troops, or even the proper names  of them. {46}    Another famous writer has given an account of everything that  passed, from beginning to end, in Armenia, Syria, Mesopotamia, upon  the Tigris, and in Media, and all in less than five hundred lines;  and when he had done this, tells us, he has written a history.  The  title, which is almost as long as the work, runs thus:  \"A narrative  of everything done by the Romans in Armenia, Media, and Mesopotamia,  by Antiochianus, who gained a prize in the sacred games of Apollo.\"  I suppose, when he was a boy, he had conquered in a running match.    I have heard of another likewise, who wrote a history of what was to  happen hereafter, {47} and describes the taking of Vologesus  prisoner, the murder of Osroes, and how he was to be given to a  lion; and above all, our own much-to-be-wished-for triumph, as  things that must come to pass.  Thus prophesying away, he soon got  to the end of the story.  He has built, moreover, a new city in  Mesopotamia, most magnificently magnificent, and most beautifully  beautiful, and is considering with himself whether he shall call it  Victoria, from victory, or the City of Concord, or Peace, which of  them, however, is not yet determined, and this fine city must remain  without a name, filled as it is with nothing but this writer's folly  and nonsense.  He is now going about a long voyage, and to give us a  description of what is to be done in India; and this is more than a  promise, for the preface is already made, and the third legion, the  Gauls, and a small part of the Mauritanian forces under Cassius,  have already passed the river; what they will do afterwards, or how  they will succeed against the elephants, it will be some time before  our wonderful writer can be able to learn, either from Mazuris or  the Oxydraci.    Thus do these foolish fellows trifle with us, neither knowing what  is fit to be done, nor if they did, able to execute it, at the same  time determined to say anything that comes into their ridiculous  heads; affecting to be grand and pompous, even in their titles:  of  \"the Parthian victories so many books;\" Parthias, says another, like  Atthis; another more elegantly calls his book the Parthonicica of  Demetrius.    I could mention many more of equal merit with these, but shall now  proceed to make my promise good, and give some instructions how to  write better.  I have not produced these examples merely to laugh at  and ridicule these noble histories; but with the view of real  advantages, that he who avoids their errors, may himself learn to  write well--if it be true, as the logicians assert, that of two  opposites, between which there is no medium, the one being taken  away, the other must remain. {49}    Somebody, perhaps, will tell me that the field is now cleansed and  weeded, that the briars and brambles are cut up, the rubbish cleared  off, and the rough path made smooth; that I ought therefore to build  something myself, to show that I not only can pull down the  structures of others, but am able to raise up and invent a work  truly great and excellent, which nobody could find fault with, nor  Momus himself turn into ridicule.    I say, therefore, that he who would write history well must be  possessed of these two principal qualifications, a fine  understanding and a good style:  one is the gift of nature, and  cannot be taught; the other may be acquired by frequent exercise,  perpetual labour and an emulation of the ancients.  To make men  sensible and sagacious, who were not born so, is more than I pretend  to; to create and new-model things in this manner would be a  glorious thing indeed; but one might as easily make gold out of  lead, silver out of tin, a Titornus out of a Conon, or a Milo out of  a Leotrophides. {50}    What then is in the power of art or instruction to perform? not to  create qualities and perfections already bestowed, but to teach the  proper use of them; for as Iccus, Herodicus, Theon, {51} or any  other famous wrestler, would not promise to make Antiochus a  conqueror in the Olympic games, or equal to a Theagenes, or  Polydamas; but only that where a man had natural abilities for this  exercise he could, by his instruction, render him a greater  proficient in it:  far be it from me, also, to promise the invention  of an art so difficult as this, nor do I say that I can make anybody  an historian; but that I will point out to one of good  understanding, and who has been in some measure used to writing,  certain proper paths (if such they appear to him), which if any man  shall tread in, he may with greater ease and despatch do what he  ought to do, and attain the end which he is in pursuit of.    Neither can it be here asserted, be he ever so sensible or  sagacious, that he doth not stand in need of assistance with regard  to those things which he is ignorant of; otherwise he might play on  the flute or any other instrument, who had never learned, and  perform just as well; but without teaching, the hands will do  nothing; whereas, if there be a master, we quickly learn, and are  soon able to play by ourselves."]]]
