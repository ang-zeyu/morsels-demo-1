But when they came to the topmost of a certain grassy bent,    Lo there lay the land before them as thick with shield and spear    As the rich man's wealthiest acre with the harvest of the year.    There bade King Volsung tarry and dight the wedge-array;    \"For duly,\" he said, \"doeth Siggeir to meet his guests by the way.\"    So shield by shield they serried, nor ever hath been told    Of any host of battle more glorious with the gold;    And there stood the high King Volsung in the very front of war;    And lovelier was his visage than ever heretofore,    As he rent apart the peace-strings that his brand of battle bound    And the bright blade gleamed to the heavens, and he cast the sheath to the         ground.    Then up the steep came the Goth-folk, and the spear-wood drew anigh,    And earth's face shook beneath them, yet cried they never a cry;    And the Volsungs stood all silent, although forsooth at whiles    O'er the faces grown earth-weary would play the flickering smiles,    And swords would clink and rattle: not long had they to bide,    For soon that flood of murder flowed round the hillock-side;    Then at last the edges mingled, and if men forbore the shout,    Yet the din of steel and iron in the grey clouds rang about;    But how to tell of King Volsung, and the valour of his folk!    Three times the wood of battle before their edges broke;    And the shield-wall, sorely dwindled and reft of the ruddy gold,    Against the drift of the war-blast for the fourth time yet did hold.    But men's shields were waxen heavy with the weight of shafts they bore,    And the fifth time many a champion cast earthward Odin's door    And gripped the sword two-handed; and in sheaves the spears came on.    And at last the host of the Goth-folk within the shield-wall won,    And wild was the work within it, and oft and o'er again    Forth brake the sons of Volsung, and drave the foe in vain;    For the driven throng still thickened, till it might not give aback.    But fast abode King Volsung amid the shifting wrack    In the place where once was the forefront: for he said: \"My feet are old,    And if I wend on further there is nought more to behold    Than this that I see about me.\"--Whiles drew his foes away    And stared across the corpses that before his sword-edge lay.    But nought he followed after: then needs must they in front    Thrust on by the thickening spear-throng come up to bear the brunt,    Till all his limbs were weary and his body rent and torn:    Then he cried: \"Lo now, Allfather, is not the swathe well shorn?    Wouldst thou have me toil for ever, nor win the wages due?\"      And mid the hedge of foemen his blunted sword he threw,    And, laid like the oars of a longship the level war-shafts pressed    On 'gainst the unshielded elder, and clashed amidst his breast;    And dead he fell, thrust backward, and rang on the dead men's gear:    But still for a certain season durst no man draw anear,    For 'twas e'en as a great God's slaying, and they feared the wrath of         the sky;    And they deemed their hearts might harden if awhile they should let him lie.      _Of the ending of all Volsung's Sons save Sigmund only, and of how  he abideth in the wild wood._    They joined battle again, but the fight grew feeble after Volsung  fell, and his earls were struck down one by one. Last of all, his sons  were borne to earth and carried captive to the hall, where Siggeir  awaited them, for he himself had feared to face the Volsung swords.    Then he would have slain them at once without torture, but Signy  besought him that they might breathe the earthly air a day or two  before their death, and he listened to her, for he saw how he might  thus give them greater pain. He bade his men lead them to a glade in  the forest and fetter them to the mightiest tree that grew there. So  the ten Volsungs were fettered with iron to a great oak, and on the  morrow Siggeir's woodmen told him sweet tidings, for beasts of the  wood had devoured two and left their bones in the fetters. So it  befell every night till the woodmen brought word that nothing  remained of the king's foemen save their bones in the fetters that  had bound them.    Now a watch had been set on Signy lest she should send help to her  brethren, but henceforth no man hindered her from going out to the  wood. So that night she came to the glade in the forest, and saw in  the midst of it a mighty man who was toiling to dig a grave in the  greensward.      And behold, it was Sigmund the Volsung: but she cried and had no fear:      \"If thou art living, Sigmund, what day's work dost thou here    In the midnight and the forest? but if thou art nought but a ghost    Then where are those Volsung brethren, of whom thou wert best and most?\"      Then he turned about unto her, and his raiment was fouled and torn,    And his eyen were great and hollow, as a famished man forlorn;      But he cried: \"Hail, Sister Signy! I looked for thee before,    Though what should a woman compass, she one alone and no more,    When all we shielded Volsungs did nought in Siggeir's land?    O yea, I am living indeed, and this labour of mine hand    Is to bury the bones of the Volsungs; and lo, it is well-nigh done.    So draw near, Volsung's daughter, and pile we many a stone    Where lie the grey wolf's gleanings of what was once so good.\"      So she set her hand to the labour, and they toiled, they twain in the wood,    And when the work was over, dead night was beginning to fall:    Then spake the white-hand Signy: \"Now shall thou tell the tale    Of the death of the Volsung brethren ere the wood thy wrath shall hide,    Ere I wend me back sick-hearted in the dwelling of kings to abide.\"    Then said Sigmund:    \"We lay fettered to the tree and at midnight there came from the  thicket two mighty wood-wolves, and falling on my brethren Gylfi and  Geirmund, they devoured them in their bonds, and turned again to the  forest. Night after night, my sister, this befell, till I was left  alone with our brother Sigi to await the wood-beasts. Then came  midnight, and one of the wolves fell upon Sigi and the other turned  on me. But I met it with snarling like its own, and my teeth gripped  its throat, and my hands strove with the fetters till they burst. So  I slew the beast with my irons, but when I looked, Sigi lay dead, and  the other wolf had fled again to the thicket. Then I lay hid till  Siggeir's woodmen had looked on the place and departed with their  tidings, and as I beheld them I knew that pity was killed in my  heart, and that henceforward I should live but to avenge me on him  who hath so set the gods at nought.\" Then Signy spake noble words of  comfort, saying: \"I wot well that Siggeir shall pay the due price of  his deeds, though the vengeance may tarry long, and I wot also that  thy life shall yet know gladness. Bear a stout heart, therefore, to  meet the waiting time, and make thee a lair in the woods whence thou  mayest fall on men of the Goth-folk, and win what thy life needeth.  As for me, I will see thy face once again ere many days are past to  wot where thou dwellest and then must we meet no more.\"    And so saying, she kissed him and departed, but Sigmund turned in the  dawn-light, and sought a wood-lair as she had bidden him.      _Of the fostering of Sinfiotli, Signy's son, and of the slaying of  Siggeir the Goth-king._      So wrought is the will of King Siggeir, and he weareth Odin's sword    And it lies on his knees in the council and hath no other lord:    And he sendeth earls o'er the sea-flood to take King Volsung's land,    And those scattered and shepherdless sheep must come beneath his hand.    And he holdeth the milk-white Signy as his handmaid and his wife,    And nought but his will she doeth, nor raiseth a word of strife;    So his heart is praising his wisdom, and he deems him of most avail    Of all the lords of the cunning that teacheth how to prevail.    Now Sigmund dwelt long in the wild-wood, abiding in a strong cave deep  hidden in a thicket by the river-side.    And now and again he fell upon the folk of Siggeir as they journeyed,  and slew them, and thus he had war-gear and gold as much as he would.  Also he became a master of masters in the smithying craft, and the  folk who beheld the gleam of his forge by night, deemed that a king  of the Giants was awakened from death to dwell there, and they durst  not wander near the cavern.    So passed the years till on a springtide morning Signy sent forth to  Sigmund a damsel leading her eldest son, a child of ten summers, and  bearing a word of her mouth to bid him foster the child for his  helper, if he should prove worthy and bold-hearted. And Sigmund  heeded her words and fostered the child for the space of three months  even though he could give no love to a son of Siggeir.    At last he was minded to try the boy's courage, to which end he set a  deadly ash-grey adder in the meal-sack, and bade the child bake bread.  But he feared when he found something that moved in the meal and had  not courage to do the task. Then would Sigmund foster him no longer,  but thrust him out from the woods to return to his father's hall.
