The American drummer winked triumphantly at his brethren. \"He's all  right,\" he observed, jerking a thumb after the Virginian. \"He's easy.  You got to know him to work him. That's all.\"    \"Und vat is your point?\" inquired the German drummer.    \"Point is--he'll not take any goods off you or me; but he's going to  talk up the killer to any consumptive he runs across. I ain't done with  him yet. Say,\" (he now addressed the proprietor), \"what's her name?\"    \"Whose name?\"    \"Woman runs the eating-house.\"    \"Glen. Mrs. Glen.\"    \"Ain't she new?\"    \"Been settled here about a month. Husband's a freight conductor.\"    \"Thought I'd not seen her before. She's a good-looker.\"    \"Hm! Yes. The kind of good looks I'd sooner see in another man's wife  than mine.\"    \"So that's the gait, is it?\"    \"Hm! well, it don't seem to be. She come here with that reputation. But  there's been general disappointment.\"    \"Then she ain't lacked suitors any?\"    \"Lacked! Are you acquainted with cow-boys?\"    \"And she disappointed 'em? Maybe she likes her husband?\"    \"Hm! well, how are you to tell about them silent kind?\"    \"Talking of conductors,\" began the drummer. And we listened to his  anecdote. It was successful with his audience; but when he launched  fluently upon a second I strolled out. There was not enough wit in  this narrator to relieve his indecency, and I felt shame at having been  surprised into laughing with him.    I left that company growing confidential over their leering stories,  and I sought the saloon. It was very quiet and orderly. Beer in quart  bottles at a dollar I had never met before; but saving its price, I  found no complaint to make of it. Through folding doors I passed from  the bar proper with its bottles and elk head back to the hall with its  various tables. I saw a man sliding cards from a case, and across the  table from him another man laying counters down. Near by was a second  dealer pulling cards from the bottom of a pack, and opposite him a  solemn old rustic piling and changing coins upon the cards which lay  already exposed.    But now I heard a voice that drew my eyes to the far corner of the room.    \"Why didn't you stay in Arizona?\"    Harmless looking words as I write them down here. Yet at the sound of  them I noticed the eyes of the others directed to that corner. What  answer was given to them I did not hear, nor did I see who spoke. Then  came another remark.    \"Well, Arizona's no place for amatures.\"    This time the two card dealers that I stood near began to give a part of  their attention to the group that sat in the corner. There was in me a  desire to leave this room. So far my hours at Medicine Bow had seemed  to glide beneath a sunshine of merriment, of easy-going jocularity. This  was suddenly gone, like the wind changing to north in the middle of a  warm day. But I stayed, being ashamed to go.    Five or six players sat over in the corner at a round table where  counters were piled. Their eyes were close upon their cards, and one  seemed to be dealing a card at a time to each, with pauses and betting  between. Steve was there and the Virginian; the others were new faces.    \"No place for amatures,\" repeated the voice; and now I saw that it was  the dealer's. There was in his countenance the same ugliness that his  words conveyed.    \"Who's that talkin'?\" said one of the men near me, in a low voice.    \"Trampas.\"    \"What's he?\"    \"Cow-puncher, bronco-buster, tin-horn, most anything.\"    \"Who's he talkin' at?\"    \"Think it's the black-headed guy he's talking at.\"    \"That ain't supposed to be safe, is it?\"    \"Guess we're all goin' to find out in a few minutes.\"    \"Been trouble between 'em?\"    \"They've not met before. Trampas don't enjoy losin' to a stranger.\"    \"Fello's from Arizona, yu' say?\"    \"No. Virginia. He's recently back from havin' a look at Arizona. Went  down there last year for a change. Works for the Sunk Creek outfit.\" And  then the dealer lowered his voice still further and said something  in the other man's ear, causing him to grin. After which both of them  looked at me.    There had been silence over in the corner; but now the man Trampas spoke  again.    \"AND ten,\" said he, sliding out some chips from before him. Very strange  it was to hear him, how he contrived to make those words a personal  taunt. The Virginian was looking at his cards. He might have been deaf.    \"AND twenty,\" said the next player, easily.    The next threw his cards down.    It was now the Virginian's turn to bet, or leave the game, and he did  not speak at once.    Therefore Trampas spoke. \"Your bet, you son-of-a--.\"    The Virginian's pistol came out, and his hand lay on the table, holding  it unaimed. And with a voice as gentle as ever, the voice that sounded  almost like a caress, but drawling a very little more than usual, so  that there was almost a space between each word, he issued his orders  to the man Trampas: \"When you call me that, SMILE.\" And he looked at  Trampas across the table.    Yes, the voice was gentle. But in my ears it seemed as if somewhere the  bell of death was ringing; and silence, like a stroke, fell on the large  room. All men present, as if by some magnetic current, had become aware  of this crisis. In my ignorance, and the total stoppage of my thoughts,  I stood stock-still, and noticed various people crouching, or shifting  their positions.    \"Sit quiet,\" said the dealer, scornfully to the man near me. \"Can't you  see he don't want to push trouble? He has handed Trampas the choice to  back down or draw his steel.\"    Then, with equal suddenness and ease, the room came out of its  strangeness. Voices and cards, the click of chips, the puff of tobacco,  glasses lifted to drink,--this level of smooth relaxation hinted no more  plainly of what lay beneath than does the surface tell the depth of the  sea.    For Trampas had made his choice. And that choice was not to \"draw his  steel.\" If it was knowledge that he sought, he had found it, and no  mistake! We heard no further reference to what he had been pleased  to style \"amatures.\" In no company would the black-headed man who had  visited Arizona be rated a novice at the cool art of self-preservation.    One doubt remained: what kind of a man was Trampas? A public back-down  is an unfinished thing,--for some natures at least. I looked at his  face, and thought it sullen, but tricky rather than courageous.    Something had been added to my knowledge also. Once again I had heard  applied to the Virginian that epithet which Steve so freely used. The  same words, identical to the letter. But this time they had produced a  pistol. \"When you call me that, SMILE!\" So I perceived a new example of  the old truth, that the letter means nothing until the spirit gives it  life.          III. STEVE TREATS      It was for several minutes, I suppose, that I stood drawing these silent  morals. No man occupied himself with me. Quiet voices, and games of  chance, and glasses lifted to drink, continued to be the peaceful order  of the night. And into my thoughts broke the voice of that card-dealer  who had already spoken so sagely. He also took his turn at moralizing.    \"What did I tell you?\" he remarked to the man for whom he continued to  deal, and who continued to lose money to him.    \"Tell me when?\"    \"Didn't I tell you he'd not shoot?\" the dealer pursued with complacence.  \"You got ready to dodge. You had no call to be concerned. He's not the  kind a man need feel anxious about.\"    The player looked over at the Virginian, doubtfully. \"Well,\" he said, \"I  don't know what you folks call a dangerous man.\"    \"Not him!\" exclaimed the dealer with admiration. \"He's a brave man.  That's different.\"    The player seemed to follow this reasoning no better than I did.    \"It's not a brave man that's dangerous,\" continued the dealer. \"It's the  cowards that scare me.\" He paused that this might sink home.    \"Fello' came in here las' Toosday,\" he went on. \"He got into some  misunderstanding about the drinks. Well, sir, before we could put him  out of business, he'd hurt two perfectly innocent onlookers. They'd no  more to do with it than you have,\" the dealer explained to me.    \"Were they badly hurt?\" I asked.    \"One of 'em was. He's died since.\"    \"What became of the man?\"    \"Why, we put him out of business, I told you. He died that night. But  there was no occasion for any of it; and that's why I never like to  be around where there's a coward. You can't tell. He'll always go to  shooting before it's necessary, and there's no security who he'll  hit. But a man like that black-headed guy is (the dealer indicated the  Virginian) need never worry you. And there's another point why there's  no need to worry about him: IT'D BE TOO LATE.\"    These good words ended the moralizing of the dealer. He had given us  a piece of his mind. He now gave the whole of it to dealing cards.  I loitered here and there, neither welcome nor unwelcome at present,  watching the cow-boys at their play. Saving Trampas, there was scarce  a face among them that had not in it something very likable. Here were  lusty horsemen ridden from the heat of the sun, and the wet of the  storm, to divert themselves awhile. Youth untamed sat here for an idle  moment, spending easily its hard-earned wages. City saloons rose into  my vision, and I instantly preferred this Rocky Mountain place. More  of death it undoubtedly saw, but less of vice, than did its New York  equivalents.    And death is a thing much cleaner than vice. Moreover, it was by no  means vice that was written upon these wild and manly faces. Even where  baseness was visible, baseness was not uppermost. Daring, laughter,  endurance--these were what I saw upon the countenances of the cow-boys.  And this very first day of my knowledge of them marks a date with me.  For something about"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12982"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#5)"],[1," nature,      some freak of creation, whose mission is to make novels--and      who accordingly spins, spins away, and never leaves off for      a moment--never! We know how M. Dumas manages to rear his      wonderful literary offspring. With all Mr. James's fertility,      however, the Frenchman has a thousand times Mr. James's      invention. The romances of the latter are simply a series      of ever-changing, yet never novel variations upon the one      original theme furnished by Sir Walter Scott. Dumas, with his      eighty volumes a year, yet manages to be ever fresh, ever      new. Nobody knows, till he reads it, what a novel of the      Frenchman's will be. Everybody, even before he cuts open      page one, can tell you the certain features, the stereotyped      characters, which flourish in eternal youth in the      never-ending productions of James. It is only calling them      by other names, and dressing them in different      costumes--altering, in the description of a castle, the dais      from the one end of the great hall to the other, or some such      important revolution--and _presto_, Mr. James can whip the      personages and the places who flourished in one country and      in one century right slap into another generation and another      land. The thing is done in a moment, and you have a new novel      before you--just as new, at all events, as is any in his list      of a hundred.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Botta's \"Nineveh\" has at last reached completion at Paris. It consists  of five folio volumes of the largest size; only 400 copies have been  printed; 300 of them are to be distributed by the Government, and 100  for booksellers, to be sold. The price is 1800 francs a copy, or about  $600, the total expense of the edition being 296,000 fr. or not far  from $55,000. The publication of the work on so expensive a scale,  unaccompanied by an edition cheap enough for ordinary readers, is a  great blunder; at least the reputation of the author suffers from  it. The book does not reach those for whom it is written, while of  Layard's work at least 10,000 copies have been sold, exclusive of the  sale in America.           *       *       *       *       *    Arago announces that he will at last begin the printing of his long  prepared but not yet published works. His health is deeply shattered.  When the Provincial Government ceased to exist he was so weak that he  could scarcely walk, but since then repose has considerably recruited  his strength, but he does well to undertake the long postponed  publication of his studies. The first issued will be on Measuring  the Intensity of Light, which he is now reading to the Academy;  subsequently he will bring out the Astronomy, so long waited for.  It is true that some years since a book was printed with this title,  composed from notes of some of his lectures; this work has passed  through many editions and has been translated into other languages,  though he has often protested against it as an entirely erroneous and  perverted presentation of his ideas.           *       *       *       *       *    The Rev. H.W. Bellows has resigned the editorship of _The Christian  Enquirer_, which he has conducted with distinguished ability, we  believe from its commencement.           *       *       *       *       *    Miss Cooper, a daughter of the great novellist, has been announced in  London as the author of \"Rural Hours,\" a volume to be published in two  or three weeks by Bentley, and by our Aldus, Mr. Putnam. We have read  and in this number of the _International_ give some extracts from  the advance sheets of \"Rural Hours,\" and we think the work will be  regarded as one of the most pleasing and elegant contributions which  woman has in a long time made to English literature. It is in the form  of a year's diary in the country, and it illustrates on almost every  page a large and wise cultivation, and the finest capacities for the  observation of nature. We shall hereafter enter more fully into the  discussion of its merits, but meanwhile advise the reader to obtain  the book as soon as possible, in confidence that it will prove one of  the most delightful souvenirs of the summer.           *       *       *       *       *    Prof. Agassiz of Harvard College appears in the last number of  the _Christian Examiner_--an able periodical, which no degree or  affectation of \"liberality\" should have tempted to the admission of  such a paper--in an elaborate argument against the Unity of the Human  Race. It is ridiculous to attempt a disguise of this matter: the  proposition of Prof. Agassiz is an attack upon the Christian religion,  and he is guilty of scandalous dishonesty in endeavoring to evade  its being so considered. He has undoubtedly a right to pursue any  investigation to which he may be led by a love of science, and,  guarding himself about with humility and candor, he has a right to  accept the results which may be offered in the premises by a careful  induction. But the right to assail the commonly received opinions of  mankind, especially the right to assail a people's religion, has other  and very rigid conditions, which will not, we are persuaded, justify  this new outbreak of the restless spirit of Infidelity. Certainly, it  would have become Prof. Agassiz, before venturing upon the course he  has adopted, to dissociate himself from a University to which so many  of the youth of the country have been sent without any thought on the  part of their parents that they were to be exposed there to influences  which they would dread above all others. There is no right to offer,  except to _men_, capable of its thorough apprehension, any new or  questionable or unsettled doctrine. Prof. Agassiz should have been in  a condition to receive in his own person the consequences of a failure  to establish his theory. We have no fears as to the result of the  controversy upon which he has entered. No man worthy to be called a  Christian scholar, deprecates the subjection of the Bible to any tests  that are possible. It has withstood in the last two centuries quite  too much of sham science to be in any way affected by the logic of  Prof. Agassiz. Still, the appearance of such a paper in the _Christian  Examiner_--the chief organ of American Unitarianism--is significant of  a state of feeling and opinion to be regretted, and it should summon  to the conflict the men whose predecessors made every similar wave  of Infidelity bring support and strength to the bases of the rock of  Christianity.           *       *       *       *       *    Letters from Dr. Layard have been received in London, to the 10th of  April, dated from Arban, on the River Khabour. The last account from  this quarter mentioned his purpose of penetrating into the desert,  which he has explored for three weeks, meeting with numerous traces  of ancient population, though not so many antiquities as he expected.  His present site, however, is richer in archaeological remains, and is  important, as they are undoubtedly Assyrian, and prove the extent of  that empire. Two winged bulls and other fragments are described as  very remarkable, the meadows as rich in herbage, and the banks of the  Khabour as literally gemmed with flowers; and Mr. Layard was desirous  to examine this river to its mouth; but the Arabs were hostile to the  plan, though it was trusted that arrangements would be made with the  parties, wherever they interposed between Mr. Layard and his wishes.  In his letter, he says he thinks Major Rawlinson wrong in some of his  topography, and that the chronological deductions cannot as yet be  considered settled.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Rogers, the poet, was lately knocked down by a cab, as he was  returning from a dinner party, and so seriously injured as very much  to alarm his friends.
