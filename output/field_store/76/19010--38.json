If by degrees the truth flashing occasionally on his mind, experience  and reflection arrive at undeceiving him, with respect to the power,  the intelligence, the virtues actually residing in these objects; he at  least supposes them put in activity by some secret, some hidden cause;  that they are the instruments, employed by some invisible agent, who  is either friendly or inimical to his welfare. To this concealed  agent, therefore, he addresses himself; pays him his vows; emplores  his assistance; deprecates his wrath; seeks to propitiate him to his  interests; is willing to soften his anger; for this purpose he employs  the same means, of which he avails himself, either to appease or gain  over the beings of his own species.    Societies in their origin, seeing themselves frequently afflicted  by nature, supposed either the elements, or the concealed powers who  regulated them, possessed a will, views, wants, desires, similar to  their own. From hence, the sacrifices imagined to nourish them; the  libations poured out to them; the steams, the incense to gratify their  olfactory nerves. Their superstition led them to believe these elements  or their irritated movers were to be appeased like irritated man, by  prayers, by humiliation, by presents. Their imagination was ransacked  to discover the presents that would be most acceptable in their eyes;  to ascertain the oblations that would be most agreeable, the sacrifices  that would most surely propitiate their kindness: as these did not make  known their inclinations, man differed with his fellow on those most  suitable; each followed his own disposition; or rather each offered what  was most estimable in his own eyes; hence arose differences never to be  reconciled the bitterest animosities; the most unconquerable aversions;  the most, destructive jealousies! Thus some brought the fruits of the  earth, others offered sheaves of corn: some strewed flowers over their  fanes; some decorated them with the most costly jewels; some served them  with meats; others sacrificed lambs, heifers, bulls; at length such  was their delirium, such the wildness of their imaginations, that they  stained their altars with human gore, made oblations of young children  immolated virgins, to appease the anger of these supposed deities.    The old men, as having the most experience, were usually charged with  the conduct of these peace-offerings, from whence, the name PRIEST;  [Greek letters], _presbos_, in the Greek meaning an old man. These  accompanied them with ceremonies, instituted rites, used precautions by  consulting omens; adopted formalities, retraced to their fellow citizens  the notions transmitted to them by their forefathers; collected the  observations made by their ancestors; repeated the fables they had  received; added commentaries of their own; subjoined supplications  to the idols at whose shrine they were sacrificing. It is thus  the sacerdotal order was established; thus that public worship was  established; by degrees each community formed a body of tenets to be  observed by the citizens; these were transmitted from race to race;  held sacred out of reverence for their fathers; at length it was deemed  sacrilege to doubt these pandects in any one particular; even the  errors, that had crept into them with time, were beheld with reverential  awe; he that ventured to reason upon them, was looked upon as an enemy  to the commonwealth; as one whose impiety drew down upon them the  vengeance of these adored beings, to which alone imagination had given  birth; not contented with adopting the rituals, with following the  ceremonies invented by themselves, one community waged war against  another, to oblige it to receive their particular creeds; which the old  men who regulated them, declared would infallibly win them the favor of  their tutelary deities: thus very often to conciliate their favor, the  victorious party immolated on the altars of their gods, the bodies of  their unhappy captives; frequently they carried their savage barbarity  the length of exterminating whole nations, who happened to worship gods  different from their own: thus it frequently happened, that the friends  of the serpent, when victorious, covered his altars with the mangled  carcases of the worshippers of the stone, whom the fortune of war had  placed in their hands: such were the unformed, the precarious elements  of which rude nations every where availed themselves to compose  their superstitions: they were always a system of conduct invented by  imagination: conceived in ignorance, organized in misfortune, to render  the unknown powers, to whom they believed nature was submitted, either  favorable to their views, or to, induce them to cease those afflictions,  which natural causes, for the wisest purposes, were continually heaping  upon them; thus some irascible, at the same time placable being, was  always chosen for the basis of the adopted superstition; it was upon  these puerile tenets, upon these absurd notions, that the old men or the  priests rested their doctrines; founded their rights; established their  authority: it was to render these fanciful beings friendly to the race  of man, that they erected, temples, raised altars, loaded them with  wealth; in short, it was from such rude foundations, that arose the  magnificent structure of superstition; under which man trembled for  thousands of years: which governed the condition of society, which  determined the actions of the people, gave the tone to the character,  deluged the earth with blood, for such a long series of ages. But  although these superstitions were originally invented by savages, they  still have the power of regulating the fate of many civilized  nations, who are not less tenacious of their chimeras, than their rude  progenitors. These systems, so ruinous in their principles, have been  variously modified by the human mind, of which it is the essence, to  labour incessantly on unknown objects; it always, commences by attaching  to these, a very first-rate importance, which it afterwards never dares  coolly to examine.    Such was the course of man's imagination, in the successive ideas which  he either formed to himself, or which he received from his fathers, upon  the divinity. The first theology of man was grounded on fear, modelled  by ignorance: either afflicted or benefitted by the elements, he adored  these elements themselves; by a parity of reasoning, if reasoning it can  be called, he extended his reverence to every material, coarse object;  he afterwards rendered his homage to the agents he supposed presiding  over these elements; to powerful genii; to inferior genii; to heroes;  to men endowed with either great or striking qualities. Time, aided by  reflection, with here and there a slight corruscation of truth, induced  him in some places to relinquish his original ideas; he believed  he simplified the thing by lessening the number of his gods, but he  achieved nothing by this towards attaining to the truth; in recurring  from cause to cause man finished by losing sight of every thing; in this  obscurity, in this dark abyss, his mind still laboured, he formed  new chimeras, he made new gods, or rather he formed a very complex  machinery; still, as before, whenever he could not account for any  phenomenon that struck his sight, he was unwilling to ascribe it to  physical causes; and the name of his Divinity, whatever that might  happen to be, was always brought in to supply his own ignorance of  natural causes.    If a faithful account was rendered of man's ideas upon the Divinity, he  would be obliged to acknowledge, that for the most part the word _Gods_  has been used to express the concealed, remote, unknown causes of the  effects he witnessed; that he applies this term when the spring of  natural, the source of known causes ceases to be visible: as soon as he  loses the thread of these causes, or as soon as his mind can no longer  follow the chain, he solves the difficulty, terminates his research, by  ascribing it to his gods; thus giving a vague definition to an unknown  cause, at which either his idleness, or his limited knowledge, obliges  him to stop. When, therefore, he ascribes to his gods the production  of some phenomenon, the novelty or the extent of which strikes him with  wonder, but of which his ignorance precludes him from unravelling the  true cause, or which he believes the natural powers with which he is  acquainted are inadequate to bring forth; does he, in fact, do any thing  more than substitute for the darkness of his own mind, a sound to which  he has been accustomed to listen with reverential awe? Ignorance may be  said to be the inheritance of the generality of men; these attribute to  their gods not only those uncommon effects that burst upon their senses  with an astounding force, but also the most simple events, the causes  of which are the most easy to be known to whoever shall be willing to  meditate upon them. In short, man has always respected those unknown  causes, those surprising effects which his ignorance prevented him from  fathoming.    But does this afford us one single, correct idea of the _Divinity_? Can  it be possible we are acting rationally, thus eternally to make him  the agent of our stupidity, of our sloth, of our want of information on  natural causes? Do we, in fact, pay any kind of adoration to this being,  by thus bringing him forth on every trifling occasion, to solve the  difficulties ignorance throws in our way? Of whatever nature this great  cause of causes may be, it is evident to the slightest reflection that  he has been "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8911"],[0,"Explorations in Australia (#4)"],[1,"ker, with six  horses, and all that was requisite (with one important exception, as will  be seen hereafter), for an excursion to the north-west of Swinden's  Country. They arrived at Aroona the same evening. On the following day  (the 15th) they made Morleeanna Creek, and reached Ootaina on the 16th,  about 7 p.m. Here they remained for a couple of days, as sufficient rain  had not fallen to enable them to proceed. On the afternoon of the 19th  they arrived at Mr. Sleep's, who informed them that Mr. M. Campbell had  returned from the West, being hard pushed for water; very little rain  having fallen to the west. The next day (20th) Mr. Stuart arrived at Mr.  Louden's, but, in consequence of some difficulties about the horses, he  returned to Ootaina. Various preparations, combined with want of rain,  compelled him to delay his start until the 10th of June. Here the journal  commences:--    Thursday, 10th June, 1858. Started from Ootaina at 1 p.m. for Beda.  Camped on the plain, about thirteen miles from Mount Eyre.    Friday, 11th June, West Plain. Made Mudleealpa at 11 a.m. The horses  would not drink the water. Proceeded for about five miles towards Beda.  The plains are fearfully dry; they have the appearance as if no rain had  fallen here for a long time, and I am very much afraid there will be no  water at Beda. If such should be the case, the horses will suffer too  much in the beginning of their journey to be without a drink to-night. I  think it will be best to return to Mudleealpa, leave our saddles,  rations, etc. there, and drive the horses back to water. I sent Mr.  Forster back with them, telling him if he can find no water between this  and Mr. Sleep's, to take them there, remain for the night, give them a  drink in the morning, and return; we shall then be able to make a fresh  start to-morrow. Bearings: Mount Arden, 154 degrees 30 minutes; Mount  Eyre, 77 degrees 30 minutes; Beda Hill, 272 degrees; Mount Elder, 64  degrees 50 minutes; Dutchman's Stern, 162 degrees 15 minutes.    Saturday, 12th June, Mudleealpa. In examining the creek a little higher  up, we found another well. By cleaning it out, the water is drinkable.  The horses did not arrive until it was too late to start, and having  water here now, that they can drink, we camped here another night.    Sunday, 13th June, Mudleealpa. Started for Beda. Some of the horses would  not drink the water, and others drank very little: they will be glad to  drink far worse than this before they come back, or I am much mistaken.  Arrived at Beda at sundown. I was right in my opinion; no fresh water to  be found; nothing but salt, salter than the sea. I can see nothing of Mr.  Babbage's* encampment; he must be higher up the creek. All the country we  have come over to-day is very dry. (* It will probably be recollected  that Mr. Babbage was sent out by the Government to make a north-west  course through the continent, but, when at the Elizabeth, he made an  unaccountable detour, and found himself at Port Augusta, his original  starting-point. On my return from this journey he called on me at Mount  Arden, when I furnished him with such information as he required, and he  again started, and made Chambers' Creek, which I had previously found and  named after my old friend, Mr. James Chambers, but which he called  Stuart's Creek in acknowledgment of my information, etc. J. McD. Stuart.)    Monday, 14th June, Beda. This morning we have searched all round, but can  find no fresh water, although there are numerous places that would retain  water if any quantity had fallen. Mr. Forster, whom I had sent up the  creek to Mr. Babbage's, to inquire if there was any water at Pernatta,  has returned with the information that Mr. B. was up there with all his  horses, and that there was still a little water, but not much. Started at  11.30 a.m. for that place; camped in the sand hills one hour after dark.  Here we found some pig-faces* which the horses eat freely. (* These  pig-faces belong to the Mesembryaceae, of which the common ice-plant of  our gardens is an example.) There is a great deal of moisture in them,  and they are a first-rate thing for thirsty horses; besides, they have a  powerful diuretic effect. I was unable to fix Beda Hill, all my time  being taken up in looking for water, but I hope to get its position at  Pernatta. The country was very heavy--sand hills.    Tuesday, 15th June, Sand Hills. Started at break of day for Pernatta.  About 10 a.m. met Mr. Babbage's two men returning with some of the horses  for rations. They informed me that the water was nearly all gone, but  that there was plenty in the Elizabeth, nineteen miles from Pernatta. I  intended to keep on the track, but our black insisted that Pernatta lay  through a gap, and not round the bluff. I allowed him to have his own  way. Our route was through a very stony saddle. When there we saw a gum  creek, and made for it; when we arrived at the creek he told us that was  Pernatta. We looked for water, and found a little hole, which, to our  great disappointment, contained salt water. Could see nothing of Mr.  Babbage's camp. I then asked our black where there was another water; he  said, \"Down the creek,\" which we followed. He took us to five or six  water holes, with native names, every one dry. The last one he called  Yolticourie. It being now within an hour of sundown, I would follow him  no longer, but unsaddled, and told Mr. Forster to take the black and the  horses, and to steer for the bluff; if he found no water between, to  intersect Mr. Babbage's tracks, and follow them up and get water. I  remained with our provisions. The black fellow evidently does not know  the country. I am sorry that I have taken him with me. I think I shall  send him back; he is of little use in assisting to get the horses in the  morning.    Wednesday, 16th June, Yolticourie. The horses have returned; they found  no water last night; they were obliged to camp for the night, it being so  dark, but they found Mr. Babbage's camp very early. The horses drank all  the water. I was wrong in blaming the black fellow; he took us to the  RIGHT Pernatta. It is another water that Mr. B. is encamped at. He moves  to-day for the Elizabeth, which I also will do. He found the remains of  poor Coulthard yesterday. We must have passed quite close to them in our  search for water. He has sent for me to come and assist at the burial. It  being so late in the day (12 o'clock), and the horses requiring more  water, and he having four men besides himself, I do not see that I can be  of any use, and it might cause me to lose another day, and the horses to  be another night without water, which would be an injury to them, they  not having had sufficient this morning. Mr. B. also sent to say that he  would accompany me to the Elizabeth. I have delayed an hour for him, and  he has not yet made his appearance; it being now 1 o'clock, and having to  travel seventeen miles, I can wait no longer. Started for Bottle Hill;  arrived on the south side of the hill an hour and a half before sundown,  found some water and plenty of grass; encamped for the night. Distance  to-day, seventeen miles. The former part of the journey was over very  stony country; the latter part very heavy sand hills.    Thursday, 17th June, Bottle Hill. Got on the top of Bottle Hill to take  bearings, but was disappointed; could see no hill except one, which was  either Mount Deception or Mount North-west; the bearing was 51 degrees 30  minutes. There is a small cone of stones on the top, and a flat stone on  the top of it, with the names of Louden and Burtt. From here I saw the  gum trees in the Elizabeth; course to them 325 degrees 30 minutes, seven  miles to the creek. The country from the hill here is of the very worst  description--nothing but sand and salt bush.    Friday, 18th June, The Elizabeth. We must rest our horses to-day, they  have not yet recovered from their long thirst. I am quite disappointed  with this creek and the surrounding country. The water is not permanent,  it is only rain water; since we arrived yesterday it has shrunk a great  deal. There are small plains on each side from a quarter to half a mile  broad with salt bush; the hills are very stony with a little salt bush,  and destitute of timber, except the few gum-trees in the creek and the  mulga bushes in the sand hills.    Saturday, 19th June, The Elizabeth. The sky was quite overcast with cloud  during the night, and a few drops of rain fell, but of no consequence.  Started at 9.30 a.m., on a bearing of 308 degrees for six miles; changed  the bearing to 355 degrees for one mile and a half; next bearing 328  degrees for four miles, to the north side of a dry swamp; next bearing 4  degrees for ten miles and a half; next bearing 350 degrees for four miles  to a sand hill. Camped. Distance to-day, twenty-five miles, over a very  bad country, with large fragments of a hard flinty stone covering the  surface. Salt bush with small sand hills. No water.    Sunday, 20th June, Sand Hill. Started at 9 a.m., on a course of 25  degrees for sixteen miles. At 1 p.m., came upon a creek, in which I  thought there might be water; examined it and found two water holes, with  plenty of grass upon their banks. The water is not permanent. Our course  to-day has been across stony plains (covered on the surface with  fragments resembling hard white quartz), with sand hills about two miles  broad dividing them. The black did not know of this water; I am very  doubtful of his knowing anything of the country. The stony plains are  surrounded by high heavy sand hills, especially to the west and  north-west; I dare not attempt to get through them without rain. They are  much higher than the country that I am travelling through. It seems as if  there had been no rain for twelve months, every thing is so dried and  parched up. On further examination of the creek we have found a large  hole of clear water,"]]]
