Commonly from three to seven lilies appear in a  terminal group; but under skilful cultivation even forty will crown the  stalk that reaches a height of nine feet where its home suits it  perfectly; or maybe only a poor array of dingy yellowish caps top a  shrivelled stem when unfavorable conditions prevail. There certainly  are times when its specific name seems extravagant.      Red, Wood, Flame, or Philadelphia Lily    _Lilium philadelphicum_    _Flowers_--Erect, tawny, or red-tinted outside; vermilion, or sometimes  reddish orange, and spotted with madder brown within; 1 to 5, on  separate peduncles, borne at the summit. Perianth of 6 distinct,  spreading, spatulate segments, each narrowed into a claw, and with a  nectar groove at its base; 6 stamens; 1 style, the club-shaped stigma  3-lobed. _Stem:_ 1 to 3 ft. tall, from a bulb composed of narrow,  jointed, fleshy scales. _Leaves:_ In whorls of 3's to 8's, lance-shaped,  seated at intervals on the stem.    _Preferred Habitat_--Dry woods, sandy soil, borders, and thickets.    _Flowering Season_--June-July.    _Distribution_--Northern border of United States, westward to Ontario,  south to the Carolinas and West Virginia.    Erect, as if conscious of its striking beauty, this vivid lily lifts a  chalice that suggests a trap for catching sunbeams from fiery old Sol.  Defiant of his scorching rays in its dry habitat, it neither nods nor  droops even during prolonged drought; and yet many people confuse it  with the gracefully pendent, swaying bells of the yellow Canada Lily,  which will grow in a swamp rather than forego moisture. _La_, the Celtic  for white, from which the family derived its name, makes this  bright-hued flower blush to own it. Seedsmen, who export quantities of  our superb native lilies to Europe, supply bulbs so cheap that no one  should wait four years for flowers from seed, or go without their  splendor in our over-conventional gardens.      Yellow Adder's Tongue; Trout Lily; Dog-tooth \"Violet\"    _Erythronium americanum_    _Flower_--Solitary, pale russet yellow, rarely tinged with purple,  slightly fragrant, 1 to 2 in. long, nodding from the summit of a  root-stalk 6 to 12 in, high, or about as tall as the leaves. Perianth  bell-shaped, of 6 petal-like, distinct segments, spreading at tips,  dark spotted within; 6 stamens; the club-shaped style with 3 short,  stigmatic ridges. _Leaves:_ 2, unequal, grayish green, mottled and  streaked with brown or all green, oblong, 3 to 8 in. long, narrowing  into clasping petioles.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist open woods and thickets, brooksides.    _Flowering Season_--March-May.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Florida, westward to the Mississippi.    Colonies of these dainty little lilies, that so often grow beside  leaping brooks where and when the trout hide, justify at least one of  their names; but they have nothing in common with the violet or a dog's  tooth. Their faint fragrance rather suggests a tulip; and as for the  bulb, which in some of the lily-kin has toothlike scales, it is in this  case a smooth, egg-shaped corm, producing little round offsets from its  base. Much fault is also found with another name on the plea that the  curiously mottled and delicately pencilled leaves bring to mind, not a  snake's tongue, but its skin, as they surely do. Whoever sees the sharp  purplish point of a young plant darting above ground in earliest spring,  however, at once sees the fitting application of adder's tongue. But how  few recognize their plant friends at all seasons of the year!    Every one must have noticed the abundance of low-growing spring flowers  in deciduous woodlands, where, later in the year, after the leaves  overhead cast a heavy shade, so few blossoms are to be found, because  their light is seriously diminished. The thrifty adder's tongue, by  laying up nourishment in its storeroom underground through the winter,  is ready to send its leaves and flower upward to take advantage of the  sunlight the still naked trees do not intercept, just as soon as the  ground thaws.      Yellow Clintonia    _Clintonia borealis_    _Flowers--_Straw color or greenish yellow, less than 1 in. long, 3 to 6  _nodding_ on slender pedicels from the summit of a leafless scape 6 to  15 in. tall. Perianth of 6 spreading divisions, the 6 stamens attached;  style, 3-lobed. _Leaves:_ Dark, glossy, large, oval to oblong, 2 to 5  (usually 3), sheathing at the base. _Fruit:_ Oval blue berries on  _upright_ pedicels.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist, rich, cool woods and thickets.    _Flowering Season_--May-June.    _Distribution-_--From the Carolinas and Wisconsin far northward.    To name canals, bridges, city thoroughfares, booming factory towns after  De Witt Clinton seems to many appropriate enough; but why a shy little  woodland flower? As fitly might a wee white violet carry down the name  of Theodore Roosevelt to posterity! \"Gray should not have named the  flower from the Governor of New York,\" complains Thoreau. \"What is he to  the lovers of flowers in Massachusetts? If named after a man, it must be  a man of flowers.\" So completely has Clinton, the practical man of  affairs, obliterated Clinton, the naturalist, from the popular mind,  that, were it not for this plant keeping his memory green, we should be  in danger of forgetting the weary, overworked governor, fleeing from  care to the woods and fields; pursuing in the open air the study which  above all others delighted and refreshed him; revealing in every leisure  moment a too-often forgotten side of his many-sided greatness.      Wild Spikenard; False Solomon's Seal; Solomon's Zig-zag    _Smilacina racemosa_    _Flowers_--White or greenish, small, slightly fragrant, in a densely  flowered terminal raceme. Perianth of 6 separate, spreading segments; 6  stamens; 1 pistil. _Stem:_ Simple, somewhat angled, 1 to 3 ft. high,  scaly below, leafy, and sometimes finely hairy above. _Leaves:_  Alternate and seated along stem, oblong, lance-shaped, 3 to 6 in. long,  finely hairy beneath. _Rootstock:_ Thick, fleshy. _Fruit:_ A cluster of  aromatic, round, pale red speckled berries.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist woods, thickets, hillsides.    _Flowering Season_--May-July.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Georgia; westward to Arizona and  British Columbia.    As if to offer opportunities for comparison to the confused novice, the  true Solomon's Seal and the so-called false species--quite as honest a  plant--usually grow near each other. Grace of line, rather than beauty  of blossom, gives them both their chief charm. But the feathery plume of  greenish-white blossoms that crowns the false Solomon's Seal's somewhat  zig-zagged stem is very different from the small, greenish, bell-shaped  flowers, usually nodding in pairs along the stem, under the leaves, from  the axils of the true Solomon's Seal. Later in summer, when hungry birds  wander through the woods with increased families, the Wild Spikenard  offers them branching clusters of pale red speckled berries, whereas the  former plant feasts them with blue-black fruit.      Hairy, or True, or Twin-flowered Solomon's Seal    _Polygonatum biflorum_    _Flowers_--Whitish or yellowish green, tubular, bell-shaped, 1 to 4, but  usually 2, drooping on slender peduncles from leaf axils. Perianth  6-lobed at entrance, but not spreading; 6 stamens, the filaments  roughened; 1 pistil. _Stem:_ Simple, slender, arching, leafy, 8 in. to 3  ft. long. _Leaves:_ Oval, pointed, or lance-shaped, alternate, 2 to 4  in. long, seated on stem, pale beneath and softly hairy along veins.  _Rootstock:_ Thick, horizontal, jointed, scarred. (_Polygonatum_ = many  joints.) _Fruit:_ A blue-black berry.    _Preferred Habitat_--Woods, thickets, shady banks.    _Flowering Season_--April-June.    _Distribution_--New Brunswick to Florida, westward to Michigan.    From a many-jointed, thick rootstock a single graceful curved stem  arises each spring, withers after fruiting, and leaves a round scar,  whose outlines suggested to the fanciful man who named the genus the  seal of Israel's wise king. Thus one may know the age of a root by its  seals, as one tells that of a tree by the rings in its trunk.      Early or Dwarf Wake-Robin    _Trillium nivale_    _Flowers_--Solitary, pure white, about 1 in. long, on an erect or curved  peduncle, from a whorl of 3 leaves at summit of stem. Three spreading,  green, narrowly oblong sepals; 3 oval or oblong petals; 6 stamens, the  anthers about as long as filaments; 3 slender styles stigmatic along  inner side. _Stem_: 2 to 6 in. high, from a short, tuber-like rootstock.  _Leaves_: 3 in a whorl below the flower, 1 to 2 in. long, broadly oval,  rounded at end, on short petioles. _Fruit_: A 3-lobed reddish berry,  about 1/2 in. diameter, the sepals adhering.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rich, moist woods and thickets.    _Flowering Season_--March-May.    _Distribution_--Pennsylvania, westward to Minnesota and Iowa, south  to Kentucky.    Only this delicate little flower, as white as the snow it sometimes must  push through to reach the sunshine melting the last drifts in the  leafless woods, can be said to wake the robins into song; a full chorus  of feathered love-makers greets the appearance of the more widely  distributed, and therefore better known, species.    By the rule of three all the trilliums, as their name implies,  regulate their affairs. Three sepals, three petals, twice three  stamens, three styles, a three-celled ovary, the flower growing out  from a whorl of three leaves, make the naming of wake-robins a simple  matter to the novice.    One of the most chastely beautiful of our native wild flowers--so lovely  that many shady nooks in English rock-gardens and ferneries contain  imported clumps of the vigorous plant--is the Large-flowered Wake-Robin,  or White Wood Lily (_T. grandiflorum_).

Volume 1 (#4)"],[1,"itted, felt an interest in obstructing the practice of his duties,  even when he knew them. Time, with the influence of ignorance, aided by  his corruption, gave them a strength not to be resisted by his enfeebled  voice. His duties continued unperformed, and he fell into contempt both  with himself and with others.    The ignorance of Man has endured so long, he has taken such slow,  such irresolute steps to ameliorate his condition, only because he has  neglected to study Nature, to scrutinize her laws, to search out her  expedients, to discover her properties, that his sluggishness finds its  account, in permitting himself to be guided by example, rather than to  follow experience, which demands activity; to be led by routine, rather  than by his reason, which enjoins reflection; to take that for truth  upon the authority of others, which would require a diligent and patient  investigation. From hence may be traced the hatred man betrays for every  thing that deviates from those rules to which he has been accustomed;  hence his stupid, his scrupulous respect for antiquity, for the most  silly, the most absurd and ridiculous institutions of his fathers:  hence those fears that seize him, when the most beneficial changes are  proposed to him, or the most likely attempts are made to better his  condition. He dreads to examine, because he has been taught to hold  it irreverent of something immediately connected with his welfare; his  credulity suffers him to believe the interested advice, and spurns at  those who wish to show him the danger of the road he is travelling.    This is the reason why nations linger on in the most shameful lethargy,  suffering under abuses handed down from century to century, trembling at  the very idea of that which alone can repair their calamities.    It is for want of energy, for want of consulting experience, that  medicine, natural philosophy, agriculture, painting, in fact, all the  useful sciences, have so long remained under the fetters of authority,  have progressed so little: those who profess these sciences, prefer  treading the beaten paths, however imperfect, rather than strike out  new ones,--they prefer the phrensy of their imagination, their voluntary  conjectures, to that laboured experience which alone can extract her  secrets from Nature.    Man, in short, whether from sloth or from terror, having abnegated the  evidence of his senses, has been guided in all his actions, in all his  enterprizes, by imagination, by enthusiasm, by habit, by preconceived  opinions, but above all, by the influence of authority, which knew  well how to deceive him, to turn his ignorance to esteem, his sloth  to advantage. Thus imaginary, unsubstantial systems, have supplied the  place of experience--of mature reflection--of reason. Man, petrified  with his fears, intoxicated with the marvellous, stupified with sloth,  surrendered his experience: guided by his credulity, he was unable to  fall back upon it; he became consequently inexperienced; from thence he  gave birth to the most ridiculous opinions, or else adopted all those  vague chimeras, all those idle notions offered to him by men whose  interest it was to continue him in that lamentable state of ignorance.    Thus the human race has continued so long in a state of infancy, because  man has been inattentive to Nature; has neglected her ways,  because he has disdained experience--because he has thrown by his  reason--because he has been enraptured with the marvellous and the  supernatural,--because he has unnecessarily TREMBLED. These are the  reasons there is so much trouble in conducting him from this state of  childhood to that of manhood. He has had nothing but the most trifling  hypotheses, of which he has never dared to examine either the principles  or the proofs, because he has been accustomed to hold them sacred, to  consider them as the most perfect truths, and which he is not permitted  to doubt, even for an instant. His ignorance made him credulous; his  curiosity made him swallow the wonderful: time confirmed him in his  opinions, and he passed his conjectures from race to race for realities;  a tyrannical power maintained him in his notions, because by those alone  could society be enslaved. It was in vain that some faint glimmerings  of Nature occasionally attempted the recall of his reason--that slight  corruscations of experience sometimes threw his darkness into light, the  interest of the few was founded on his enthusiasm; their pre-eminence  depended on his love of the marvellous; their very existence rested on  the firmness of his ignorance; they consequently suffered no opportunity  to escape, of smothering even the transient flame of intelligence.  The many were thus first deceived into credulity, then forced into  submission. At length the whole science of man became a confused mass  of darkness, falsehood, and contradictions, with here and there a feeble  ray of truth, furnished by that Nature, of which he can never entirely  divest himself; because, without his perception, his necessities are  continually bringing him back to her resources.    Let us then, if possible, raise ourselves above these clouds of  prepossession! Let us quit the heavy atmosphere in which we are  enucleated; let us in a more unsullied medium--in a more elastic  current, contemplate the opinions of men, and observe their various  systems. Let us learn to distrust a disordered conception; let us take  that faithful monitor, experience, for our guide; let us consult Nature,  examine her laws, dive into her stores; let us draw from herself, our  ideas of the beings she contains; let us recover our senses, which  interested error has taught us to suspect; let us consult that reason,  which, for the vilest purposes has been so infamously calumniated, so  cruelly dishonoured; let us examine with attention the visible world;  let us try, if it will not enable us to form a supportable judgment of  the invisible territory of the intellectual world: perhaps it may be  found there has been no sufficient reason for distinguishing them--that  it is not without motives, well worthy our enquiry, that two empires  have been separated, which are equally the inheritance of nature.    The universe, that vast assemblage of every thing that exists, presents  only matter and motion: the whole offers to our contemplation, nothing  but an immense, an uninterrupted succession of causes and effects; some  of these causes are known to us, because they either strike immediately  on our senses, or have been brought under their cognizance, by the  examination of long experience; others are unknown to us, because they  act upon us by effects, frequently very remote from their primary cause.  An immense variety of matter, combined under an infinity of forms,  incessantly communicates, unceasingly receives a diversity of impulses.  The different qualities of this matter, its innumerable combinations,  its various methods of action, which are the necessary consequence of  these associations, constitute for man what he calls the ESSENCE of  beings: it is from these varied essences that spring the orders, the  classes, or the systems, which these beings respectively possess, of  which the sum total makes up that which is known by the term _nature_.    Nature, therefore, in its most significant meaning, is the great  whole that results from the collection of matter, under its various  combinations, with that contrariety of motion, which the universe  presents to our view. Nature, in a less extended sense, or considered in  each individual, is the whole that results from its essence; that is  to say, the peculiar qualities, the combination, the impulse, and the  various modes of action, by which it is discriminated from other beings.  It is thus that MAN is, as a whole, or in his nature, the result of  a certain combination of matter, endowed with peculiar properties,  competent to give, capable of receiving, certain impulses, the  arrangement of which is called _organization_; of which the essence is,  to feel, to think, to act, to move, after a manner distinguished from  other beings, with which he can be compared. Man, therefore, ranks in  an order, in a system, in a class by himself, which differs from that of  other animals, in whom we do not perceive those properties of which he  is possessed. The different systems of beings, or if they will, their  _particular natures_, depend on the general system of the great whole,  or that Universal Nature, of which they form a part; to which every  thing that exists is necessarily submitted and attached.    Having described the proper definition that should be applied to the  word NATURE, I must advise the reader, once for all, that whenever in  the course of this work the expression occurs, that \"Nature produces  such or such an effect,\" there is no intention of personifying that  nature which is purely an abstract being; it merely indicates that the  effect spoken of necessarily springs from the peculiar properties of  those beings which compose the mighty macrocosm. When, therefore, it is  said, _Nature demands that man should pursue his own happiness_, it is  to prevent circumlocution--to avoid tautology; it is to be understood,  that it is the property of a being that feels, that thinks, that acts,  to labour to its own happiness; in short, that is called _natural_,  which is conformable to the essence of things, or to the laws, which  Nature prescribes to the beings she contains, in the different orders  they occupy, under the various circumstances through which they are  obliged to pass. Thus health is _natural_ to man in a certain state;  disease is _natural_ to him under other circumstances; dissolution, or  if they will, death, is a _natural_ state for a body, deprived of some  of those things, necessary to maintain the existence of the animal, &c.  By ESSENCE is to be understood, that which constitutes a"]]]
