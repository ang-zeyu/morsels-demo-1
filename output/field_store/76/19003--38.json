None careth for me, none  giveth me aught: all men blame, all speak evil of me.\"    Is this the witness thou wilt bear, and do dishonour to the calling  wherewith He hath called thee, because He hath done thee so great  honour, and deemed thee worthy of being summoned to bear witness in so  great a cause?          L    Wouldst thou have men speak good of thee? speak good of them. And when  thou hast learned to speak good of them, try to do good unto them, and  thus thou wilt reap in return their speaking good of thee.          LI    When thou goest in to any of the great, remember that Another from above  sees what is passing, and that thou shouldst please Him rather than man.  He therefore asks thee:--    \"In the Schools, what didst thou call exile, imprisonment, bonds, death  and shame?\"    \"I called them things indifferent.\"    \"What then dost thou call them now? Are they at all changed?\"    \"No.\"    \"Is it then thou that art changed?\"    \"No.\"    \"Say then, what are things indifferent?\"    \"Things that are not in our power.\"    \"Say then, what follows?\"    \"That things which are not in our power are nothing to me.\"    \"Say also what things you hold to be good.\"    \"A will such as it ought to be, and a right use of the things of sense.\"    \"And what is the end?\"    \"To follow Thee!\"          LII    \"That Socrates should ever have been so treated by the Athenians!\"    Slave! why say \"Socrates\"? Speak of the thing as it is: That ever then  the poor body of Socrates should have been dragged away and haled by  main force to prison! That ever hemlock should have been given to the  body of Socrates; that that should have breathed its life away!--Do you  marvel at this? Do you hold this unjust? Is it for this that you accuse  God? Had Socrates no compensation for this? Where then for him was the  ideal Good? Whom shall we hearken to, you or him? And what says he?    \"Anytus and Melitus may put me to death: to injure me is beyond their  power.\"    And again:--    \"If such be the will of God, so let it be.\"          LIII    Nay, young man, for heaven's sake; but once thou hast heard these words,  go home and say to thyself:--\"It is not Epictetus that has told me these  things: how indeed should he? No, it is some gracious God through him.  Else it would never have entered his head to tell me them--he that is  not used to speak to any one thus. Well, then, let us not lie under the  wrath of God, but be obedient unto Him.\"---Nay, indeed; but if a raven  by its croaking bears thee any sign, it is not the raven but God that  sends the sign through the raven; and if He signifies anything to thee  through human voice, will He not cause the man to say these words to  thee, that thou mayest know the power of the Divine--how He sends a sign  to some in one way and to others in another, and on the greatest and  highest matters of all signifies His will through the noblest messenger?    What else does the poet mean:--         I spake unto him erst Myself, and sent       Hermes the shining One, to check and warn him,       The husband not to slay, nor woo the wife!          LIV    In the same way my friend Heraclitus, who had a trifling suit about a  petty farm at Rhodes, first showed the judges that his cause was just,  and then at the finish cried, \"I will not entreat you: nor do I care  what sentence you pass. It is you who are on your trial, not I!\"--And so  he ended the case.          LV    As for us, we behave like a herd of deer. When they flee from the  huntsman's feathers in affright, which way do they turn? What haven of  safety do they make for? Why, they rush upon the nets! And thus they  perish by confounding what they should fear with that wherein no danger  lies. . . . Not death or pain is to be feared, but the fear of death or  pain. Well said the poet therefore:--    Death has no terror; only a Death of shame!          LVI    How is it then that certain external things are said to be natural, and  other contrary to Nature?    Why, just as it might be said if we stood alone and apart from others.  A foot, for instance, I will allow it is natural should be clean. But if  you take it as a foot, and as a thing which does not stand by itself, it  will beseem it (if need be) to walk in the mud, to tread on thorns, and  sometimes even to be cut off, for the benefit of the whole body; else  it is no longer a foot. In some such way we should conceive of ourselves  also. What art thou?--A man.--Looked at as standing by thyself and  separate, it is natural for thee in health and wealth long to live.  But looked at as a Man, and only as a part of a Whole, it is for that  Whole's sake that thou shouldest at one time fall sick, at another brave  the perils of the sea, again, know the meaning of want and perhaps die  an early death. Why then repine? Knowest thou not that as the foot is  no more a foot if detached from the body, so thou in like case art no  longer a Man? For what is a Man? A part of a City:--first of the City  of Gods and Men; next, of that which ranks nearest it, a miniature of  the universal City. . . . In such a body, in such a world enveloping us,  among lives like these, such things must happen to one or another. Thy  part, then, being here, is to speak of these things as is meet, and to  order them as befits the matter.          LVII    That was a good reply which Diogenes made to a man who asked him for  letters of recommendation.--\"That you are a man, he will know when he  sees you;--whether a good or bad one, he will know if he has any skill  in discerning the good or bad. But if he has none, he will never know,  though I write him a thousand times.\"--It is as though a piece of silver  money desired to be recommended to some one to be tested. If the man be  a good judge of silver, he will know: the coin will tell its own tale.          LVIII    Even as the traveller asks his way of him that he meets, inclined in no  wise to bear to the right rather than to the left (for he desires only  the way leading whither he would go), so should we come unto God as to a  guide; even as we use our eyes without admonishing them to show us some  things rather than others, but content to receive the images of such  things as they present to us. But as it is we stand anxiously  watching the victim, and with the voice of supplication call upon the  augur:--\"Master, have mercy on me: vouchsafe unto me a way of escape!\"  Slave, would you then have aught else then what is best? is there  anything better than what is God's good pleasure? Why, as far as in you  lies, would you corrupt your Judge, and lead your Counsellor astray?          LIX    God is beneficent. But the Good also is beneficent. It should seem then  that where the real nature of God is, there too is to be found the real  nature of the Good. What then is the real nature of God?--Intelligence,  Knowledge, Right Reason. Here then without more ado seek the real nature  of the Good. For surely thou dost not seek it in a plant or in an animal  that reasoneth not.          LX    Seek then the real nature of the Good in that without whose presence  thou wilt not admit the Good to exist in aught else.--What then? Are not  these other things also works of God?--They are; but not preferred to  honour, nor are they portions of God. But thou art a thing preferred to  honour: thou art thyself a fragment torn from God:--thou hast a portion  of Him within thyself. How is it then that thou dost not know thy high  descent--dost not know whence thou comest? When thou eatest, wilt  thou not remember who thou art that eatest and whom thou feedest? In  intercourse, in exercise, in discussion knowest thou not that it is  a God whom thou feedest, a God whom thou exercisest, a God whom thou  bearest about with thee, O miserable! and thou perceivest it not.  Thinkest thou that I speak of a God of silver or gold, that is without  thee? Nay, thou bearest Him within thee! all unconscious of polluting Him  with thoughts impure and unclean deeds. Were an image of God present,  thou wouldest not dare to act as thou dost, yet, when God Himself is  present within thee, beholding and hearing all, thou dost not blush to  think such thoughts and do such deeds, O thou that art insensible of  thine own nature and liest under the wrath of God!          LXI    Why then are we afraid when we send a young man from the Schools into  active life, lest he should indulge his appetites intemperately, lest  he should debase himself by ragged clothing, or be puffed up by fine  raiment? Knows he not the God within him; knows he not with whom he is  starting on his way? Have we patience to hear him say to us, Would I  had thee with me!--Hast thou not God where thou art, and having Him dost  thou still seek for any other! Would He tell thee aught else than these  things? Why, wert thou a statue of Phidias, an Athena or a Zeus, thou  wouldst bethink thee both of thyself and thine artificer; and hadst thou  any sense, thou wouldst strive to do no dishonour to thyself or him that  fashioned thee, nor appear to beholders in unbefitting guise. But now,  because God is thy Maker, is that why thou carest not of what sort  thou shalt show thyself to be? Yet how different the artists and their  workmanship! What human artist's work, for example, has in it the  faculties that are displayed in fashioning it? Is it aught but marble,  bronze, gold, or ivory? Nay, when the Athena of Phidias has put forth  her hand and received therein a Victory, in that attitude she stands  for evermore. But God's works move and breathe; they use and judge the  things of sense. The workmanship of such an Artist, wilt thou dishonor  Him? Ay, when he not only fashioned thee, but placed thee, like a ward,  in the care and guardianship of thyself alone, wilt thou not only forget  this, but also do dishonour to what is committed to thy care! If God had  entrusted thee with an orphan, wouldst thou have thus neglected him?

But it's all off. I'm not feeling well.\"    \"But it's all wrong.\" M. Feriaud gesticulated to drive home his point.  \"You give me one hundred pounds to take you away from Lexingham. Good.  It is here.\" He slapped his breast pocket. \"But the other two hundred  pounds which also you promise me to pay me when I place you safe in  France, where is that, my friend?\"    \"I will give you two hundred and fifty,\" said Roland earnestly, \"to  leave me here, and go right away, and never let me see your beastly  machine again.\"    A smile of brotherly forgiveness lit up M. Feriaud's face. The generous  Gallic nature asserted itself. He held out his arms affectionately to  Roland.    \"Ah, now you talk. Now you say something,\" he cried in his impetuous  way. \"Embrace me. You are all right.\"    Roland heaved a sigh of relief when, five minutes later, the aeroplane  disappeared over the brow of the hill. Then he began to sneeze again.    \"You're not well, you know,\" said Mr. Windlebird.    \"I've caught cold. We've been flying about all night--that French ass  lost his bearings--and my suit is thin. Can you direct me to a hotel?\"    \"Hotel? Nonsense.\" Mr. Windlebird spoke in the bluff, breezy voice which  at many a stricken board-meeting had calmed frantic shareholders as  if by magic. \"You're coming right into my house and up to bed this  instant.\"    It was not till he was between the sheets with a hot-water bottle at his  toes and a huge breakfast inside him that Roland learned the name of his  good Samaritan. When he did, his first impulse was to struggle out of  bed and make his escape. Geoffrey Windlebird's was a name which he had  learned, in the course of his mercantile career, to hold in something  approaching reverence as that of one of the mightiest business brains of  the age.    To have to meet so eminent a man in the capacity of invalid, a nuisance  about the house, was almost too much for Roland's shrinking nature. The  kindness of the Windlebirds--and there seemed to be nothing that they  were not ready to do for him--distressed him beyond measure. To have a  really great man like Geoffrey Windlebird sprawling genially over  his bed, chatting away as if he were an ordinary friend, was almost  horrible. Such condescension was too much.    Gradually, as he became convalescent, Roland found this feeling replaced  by something more comfortable. They were such a genuine, simple, kindly  couple, these Windlebirds, that he lost awe and retained only gratitude.  He loved them both. He opened his heart to them. It was not long before  he had told them the history of his career, skipping the earlier years  and beginning with the entry of wealth into his life.    \"It makes you feel funny,\" he confided to Mr. Windlebird's sympathetic  ear, \"suddenly coming into a pot of money like that. You don't seem  hardly able to realize it. I don't know what to do with it.\"    Mr. Windlebird smiled paternally.    \"The advice of an older man who has had, if I may say so, some little  experience of finance, might be useful to you there. Perhaps if you  would allow me to recommend some sound investment----\"    Roland glowed with gratitude.    \"There's just one thing I'd like to do before I start putting my money  into anything. It's like this.\"    He briefly related the story of his unfortunate affair with Muriel  Coppin. Within an hour of his departure in the aeroplane, his conscience  had begun to trouble him on this point. He felt that he had not acted  well toward Muriel. True, he was practically certain that she didn't  care a bit about him and was in love with Albert, the silent mechanic,  but there was just the chance that she was mourning over his loss; and,  anyhow, his conscience was sore.    \"I'd like to give her something,\" he said. \"How much do you think?\"    Mr. Windlebird perpended.    \"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll send my own lawyer to her with--say,  a thousand pounds--not a check, you understand, but one thousand golden  sovereigns that he can show her--roll about on the table in front of her  eyes. That'll console her. It's wonderful, the effect money in the raw  has on people.\"    \"I'd rather make it two thousand,\" said Roland. He had never really  loved Muriel, and the idea of marrying her had been a nightmare to him;  but he wanted to retreat with honor.    \"Very well, make it two thousand, if you like. Tho I don't quite know  how old Harrison is going to carry all that money.\"    As a matter of fact, old Harrison never had to try. On thinking it  over, after he had cashed Roland's check, Mr. Windlebird came to the  conclusion that seven hundred pounds would be quite as much money as it  would be good for Miss Coppin to have all at once.    Mr. Windlebird's knowledge of human nature was not at fault. Muriel  jumped at the money, and a letter in her handwriting informed Roland  next morning that his slate was clean. His gratitude to Mr. Windlebird  redoubled.    \"And now,\" said Mr. Windlebird genially, \"we can talk about that money  of yours, and the best way of investing it. What you want is something  which, without being in any way what is called speculative, nevertheless  returns a fair and reasonable amount of interest. What you want is  something sound, something solid, yet something with a bit of a kick to  it, something which can't go down and may go soaring like a rocket.\"    Roland quietly announced that was just what he did want, and lit another  cigar.    \"Now, look here, Bleke, my boy, as a general rule I don't give tips--But  I've taken a great fancy to you, Bleke, and I'm going to break my rule.  Put your money--\" he sank his voice to a compelling whisper, \"put every  penny you can afford into Wildcat Reefs.\"    He leaned back with the benign air of the Alchemist who has just  imparted to a favorite disciple the recently discovered secret of the  philosopher's stone.    \"Thank you very much, Mr. Windlebird,\" said Roland gratefully. \"I will.\"    The Napoleonic features were lightened by that rare, indulgent smile.    \"Not so fast, young man,\" laughed Mr. Windlebird. \"Getting into Wildcat  Reefs isn't quite so easy as you seem to think. Shall we say that you  propose to invest thirty thousand pounds? Yes? Very well, then. Thirty  thousand pounds! Why, if it got about that you were going to buy Wildcat  Reefs on that scale the market would be convulsed.\"    Which was perfectly true. If it had got about that any one was going to  invest thirty thousand pounds--or pence--in Wildcat Reefs, the market  would certainly have been convulsed. The House would have rocked with  laughter. Wildcat Reefs were a standing joke--except to the unfortunate  few who still held any of the shares.    \"The thing will have to be done very cautiously. No one must know. But I  think--I say I think--I can manage it for you.\"    \"You're awfully kind, Mr. Windlebird.\"    \"Not at all, my dear boy, not at all. As a matter of fact, I shall be  doing a very good turn to another pal of mine at the same time.\" He  filled his glass. \"This--\" he paused to sip--\"this pal of mine has a  large holding of Wildcats. He wants to realize in order to put the money  into something else, in which he is more personally interested.\" Mr.  Windlebird paused. His mind dwelt for a moment on his overdrawn current  account at the bank. \"In which he is more personally interested,\" he  repeated dreamily. \"But of course you couldn't unload thirty pounds'  worth of Wildcats in the public market.\"    \"I quite see that,\" assented Roland.    \"It might, however, be done by private negotiation,\" he said. \"I  must act very cautiously. Give me your check for the thirty thousand  to-night, and I will run up to town to-morrow morning, and see what I  can do.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He did it. What hidden strings he pulled, what levers he used, Roland  did not know. All Roland knew was that somehow, by some subtle means,  Mr. Windlebird brought it off. Two days later his host handed him twenty  thousand one-pound shares in the Wildcat Reef Gold-mine.    \"There, my boy,\" he said.    \"It's awfully kind of you, Mr. Windlebird.\"    \"My dear boy, don't mention it. If you're satisfied, I'm sure I am.\"    Mr. Windlebird always spoke the truth when he could. He spoke it now.    It seemed to Roland, as the days went by, that nothing could mar the  pleasant, easy course of life at the Windlebirds. The fine weather, the  beautiful garden, the pleasant company--all these things combined to  make this sojourn an epoch in his life.    He discovered his mistake one lovely afternoon as he sat smoking idly  on the terrace. Mrs. Windlebird came to him, and a glance was enough to  show Roland that something was seriously wrong. Her face was drawn and  tired.    A moment before, Roland had been thinking life perfect. The only  crumpled rose-leaf had been the absence of an evening paper. Mr.  Windlebird would bring one back with him when he returned from the city,  but Roland wanted one now. He was a great follower of county cricket,  and he wanted to know how Surrey was faring against Yorkshire. But even  this crumpled rose-leaf had been smoothed out, for Johnson, the groom,  who happened to be riding into the nearest town on an errand, had  promised to bring one back with him. He might appear at any moment now.    The sight of his hostess drove all thoughts of sport out of his mind.  She was looking terribly troubled.    It flashed across Roland that both his host and hostess had been  unusually silent at dinner the night before; and later, passing Mr.  Windlebird's room on his way to bed, he had heard their voices, low and  agitated. Could they have had some bad news?    \"Mr. Bleke, I want to speak to you.\"    Roland moved like a sympathetic cow, and waited to hear more.    \"You were not up when my husband left for the city this morning, or he "]]]
