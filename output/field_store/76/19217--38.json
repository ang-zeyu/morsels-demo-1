If a theow steal, let him make twofold bot [twice the value of      the stolen goods].\"                                 - Judicial Procedure -    The King and his freemen would hear and decide cases of wrongful  behavior such as breach of the peace. Punishment would be given to  the offender by the community.    There were occasional meetings of \"hundreds\", which were 100  households, to settle widespread disputes. The chief officer was  \"hundreder\" or \"constable\". He was responsible for keeping the  peace of the hundred.    The Druid priests decided all disputes of the Celts.                                         - - - Chapter 2 - - -                                 - The Times: 600-900 -    The country was inhabited by Anglo-Saxons. The French called it  \"Angleterre\", which means the angle or end of the earth. It was  called \"Angle land\", which later became \"England\".    A community was usually an extended family. Its members lived a  village in which a stone church was the most prominent building.  They lived in one-room huts with walls and roofs made of wood,  mud, and straw. Hangings covered the cracks in the walls to keep  the wind out. Smoke from a fire in the middle of the room filtered  out of cracks in the roof. Grain was ground at home by rotating by  hand one stone disk on another stone disk. Some villages had a  mill powered by the flow of water or by horses. All freeholders  had the duty of watch [at night] and ward [during the day], of  following the hue and cry to chase an offender, and of taking the  oath of peace. These three duties were constant until 1195.    Farmland surrounded the villages and was farmed by the community  as a whole under the direction of a lord. There was silver,  copper, iron, tin, gold, and various types of stones from remote  lead mines and quarries in the nation. Silver pennies replaced the  smaller scaetts. Freemen paid \"scot\" and bore \"lot\" according to  their means for local purposes.    Offa, the strongest of the Saxon kings, minted high-quality silver  pennies. He traded woolen coats for lava grindstones with Emperor  Charlemagne, who used a silver denarius coin. There were 12 denarii  to the solidus and 20 soldi to the pound of silver. These  denominations were taken by England as 12 pennies to the shilling  and 20 shillings to the pound. The pound sign, an \"L\" with a hash  mark derived from the word Libra, which meant weighing scales.    Everyone in the village went to church on Sunday and brought gifts  such as grain to the priest. Later, contributions in the form of  money became customary, and then expected. They were called  \"tithes\" and were spent for church repair, the clergy, and poor  and needy laborers. Local custom determined the amount. There was  also church-scot: a payment to the clergy in lieu of the first  fruits of the land. The priest was the chaplain of a landlord and  his parish was coextensive with that landlord's holding and could  include one to several villages. The priest and other men who  helped him, lived in the church building. Some churches had lead  roofs and iron hinges, latches, and locks on their doors. The land  underneath had been given to the church by former kings and  persons who wanted the church to say prayers to help their souls  go from purgatory to heaven and who also selected the first  priest. The priest conducted Christianized Easter ceremonies in  the spring and (Christ's mass) ceremonies in winter in place of  the pagan Yuletide festivities. Burning incense took the place of  pagan burnt animal offerings, which were accompanied by incense to  disguise the odor of burning flesh. Holy water replaced haunted  wells and streams. Christian incantations replaced sorcerer's  spells. Nuns assisted priests in celebrating mass and  administering the sacraments. They alone consecrated new nuns.  Vestry meetings were community meetings held for church purposes.  The people said their prayers in English, and the priest conducted  the services in English. A person joined his hands in prayer as if  to offer them for binding together in submission.    The church baptized babies and officiated or gave blessings at  marriage ceremonies. It also said prayers for the dying, gave them  funerals, and buried them. There were burial service fees, candle  dues, and plough alms. A piece of stone with the dead person's  name marked his grave. It was thought that putting the name on the  grave would assist identification of that person for being taken  to heaven. The church heard the last wish or will of the person  dying concerning who he wanted to have his property. The church  taught that it was not necessary to bury possessions with the  deceased. The church taught boys and girls.    Every man carried a horn slung on his shoulder as he went about  his work so that he could at once send out a warning to his fellow  villagers or call them in chasing a thief or other offender. The  forests were full of outlaws, so strangers who did not blow a horn  to announce themselves were presumed to be fugitive offenders who  could be shot on sight. An eorl could call upon the ceorl farmers  for about forty days to fight off an invading group.    There were several kingdoms, whose boundaries kept changing due to  warfare, which was a sin according to the church. They were each  governed by a king and witan of wise men who met at a witanegemot,  which was usually held three times a year, mostly on great church  festivals and at the end of the harvest. The king and witan chose  the witan's members of bishops, eorldormen, and thegns  [landholding farmers]. The king and hereditary claims played a  major part in the selection of the eorldormen, who were the  highest military leaders and often of the royal family. They were  also chief magistrates of large jurisdictional areas of land. The  witan included officers of the king's household and perhaps other  of his retinue. There was little distinction then between his  gesith, fighting men, guards, household companions, dependents,  and servants. The king was sometimes accompanied by his wife and  sons at the witanagemot. A king was selected by the witan  according to his worthiness, usually from among the royal family,  and could be deposed by it. The witan and king decided on laws,  taxes, and transfers of land. They made determinations of war and  peace and directed the army and the fleet. The king wore a crown  or royal helmet. He extended certain protections by the king's  peace. He could erect castles and bridges and could provide a  special protection to strangers.    A king had not only a wergeld to be paid to his family if he were  killed, but a \"cynebot\" of equal amount that would be paid to his  kingdom's people. A king's household had a chamberlain for the  royal bedchamber, a marshall to oversee the horses and military  equipment, a steward as head of household, and a cupbearer. The  king had income from fines for breach of his peace; fines and  forfeitures from courts dealing with criminal and civil cases;  salvage from ship wrecks; treasure trove [assets hidden or buried  in times of war]; treasures of the earth such as gold and silver;  mines; saltworks; tolls and other dues of markets, ports, and the  routes by land and by river generally; heriot from heirs of his  special dependents for possession of land (usually in kind,  principally in horses and weapons). He also had rights of  purveyance [hospitality and maintenance when traveling]. The king  had private lands, which he could dispose of by his will. He also  had crown lands, which belonged to his office and could not be  alienated without consent of the witan. Crown lands often included  palaces and their appendant farms, and burhs. It was a queen's  duty to run the royal estate. Also, a queen could possess, manage,  and dispose of lands in her name. Violent queens waged wars.  Kingdoms were often allied by marriage between their royal  families. There were also royal marriages to royalty on the  continent.    The houses of the wealthy had ornamented silk hangings on the  walls. Some had fine white ox horn shaved so thin they were  transparent for windows. Brightly colored drapery, often purple,  and fly nets surrounded their beds, which were covered with the  fur of animals. They slept in bed clothes on pillows stuffed with  straw. Tables plated with silver and gems held silver  candlesticks, gold and silver goblets and cups, and lamps of gold,  silver, or glass. They used silver mirrors and silver writing  pens. There were covered seats, benches, and footstools with the  head and feet of animals at their extremities. They ate from a  table covered with a cloth. Servants brought in food on spits,  from which they ate. Food was boiled, broiled, or baked. The  wealthy ate wheat bread and others ate barley bread. Ale made from  barley was passed around in a cup. Mead made from honey was also  drunk.    Men wore long-sleeved wool and linen garments reaching almost to  the knee, around which they wore a belt tied in a knot. Men often  wore a gold ring on the fourth finger of the right hand. Leather  shoes were fastened with leather thongs around the ankle. Their  hair was parted in the middle and combed down each side in waving  ringlets. The beard was parted in the middle of the chin, so that  it ended in two points. The clergy did not wear beards. Great men  wore gold-embroidered clothes, gilt buckles and brooches, and  drank from drinking horns mounted in silver gilt or in gold. Well-  to-do women wore brightly colored robes with waist bands,  headbands, necklaces, gem bracelets, and rings. Their long hair  was in ringlets and they put rouge on their cheeks. They had  beads, pins, needles, tweezers of bronze, and workboxes of bronze,  some highly ornamented. They were often doing needlework. Silk was  affordable only by the wealthy.

It is probable  that this unnatural habit among civilized men has been acquired  through unnatural methods of living, enervating luxuries and excessive  warmth.    The refining, filtering and straining apparatus of the nostrils  renders the air fit to reach the delicate organs of the throat and the  lungs, and the air is not fit to so reach these organs until it has  passed through nature's refining process. The impurities which are  stopped and retained by the sieves and mucous membrane of the  nostrils, are thrown out again by the expelled breath, in exhalation,  and in case they have accumulated too rapidly or have managed to  escape through the sieves and have penetrated forbidden regions,  nature protects us by producing a sneeze which violently ejects the  intruder.    The air, when it enters the lungs is as different from the outside  air, as is distilled water different from the water of the cistern.  The intricate purifying organization of the nostrils, arresting and  holding the impure particles in the air, is as important as is the  action of the mouth in stopping cherry-stones and fish-bones and  preventing them from being carried on to the stomach. Man should no  more breathe through his mouth than he would attempt to take food  through his nose.    Another feature of mouth-breathing is that the nasal passages, being  thus comparatively unused, consequently fail to keep themselves clean  and clear, and become clogged up and unclean, and are apt to contract  local diseases. Like abandoned roads that soon become filled with  weeds and rubbish, unused nostrils become filled with impurities and  foul matter.    One who habitually breathes through the nostrils is not likely to be  troubled with clogged or stuffy nostrils, but for the benefit of those  who have been more or less addicted to the unnatural mouth-breathing,  and who wish to acquire the natural and rational method, it may  perhaps be well to add a few words regarding the way to keep their  nostrils clean and free from impurities.    A favorite Oriental method is to snuff a little water up the nostrils  allowing it to run down the passage into the throat, from thence it  may be ejected through the mouth. Some Hindu yogis immerse the face in  a bowl of water, and by a sort of suction draw in quite a quantity of  water, but this latter method requires considerable practice, and the  first mentioned method is equally efficacious, and much more easily  performed.    Another good plan is to open the window and breathe freely, closing  one nostril with the finger or thumb, sniffing up the air through the  open nostril. Then repeat the process on the other nostril. Repeat  several times, changing nostrils. This method will usually clear the  nostrils of obstructions.    In case the trouble is caused by catarrh it is well to apply a little  vaseline or camphor ice or similar preparation. Or sniff up a little  witch-hazel extract once in a while, and you will notice a marked  improvement. A little care and attention will result in the nostrils  becoming clean and remaining so.    We have given considerable space to this subject of nostril-breathing,  not only because of its great importance in its reference to health,  but because nostril-breathing is a prerequisite to the practice of the  breathing exercises to be given later in this book, and because  nostril-breathing is one of the basic principles underlying the Yogi  Science of Breath.    We urge upon the student the necessity of acquiring this method of  breathing if he has it not, and caution him against dismissing this  phase of the subject as unimportant.          CHAPTER VII.      FOUR METHODS OF RESPIRATION.    In the consideration of the question of respiration, we must begin by  considering the mechanical arrangements whereby the respiratory  movements are effected. The mechanics of respiration manifest through  (1) the elastic movements of the lungs, and (2) the activities of the  sides and bottom of the thoracic cavity in which the lungs are  contained. The thorax is that portion of the trunk between the neck  and the abdomen, the cavity of which (known as the thoracic cavity) is  occupied mainly by the lungs and heart. It is bounded by the spinal  column, the ribs with their cartilages, the breastbone, and below by  the diaphragm. It is generally spoken of as \"the chest.\" It has been  compared to a completely shut, conical box, the small end of which Is  turned upward, the back of the box being formed by the spinal column,  the front by the breastbone and the sides by the ribs.    The ribs are twenty-four in number, twelve on each side, and emerge  from each side of the spinal column. The upper seven pair are known as  \"true ribs,\" being fastened to the breastbone direct, while the lower  five pairs are called (false ribs) or \"floating ribs,\" because they  are not so fastened, the upper two of them being fastened by cartilage  to the other ribs, the remainder having no cartilages, their forward  ends being free.    The ribs are moved in respiration by two superficial muscular layers,  known as the intercostal muscles. The diaphragm, the muscular  partition before alluded to, separates the chest box from the  abdominal cavity.    In the act of inhalation the muscles expand the lungs so that a vacuum  is created and the air rushes in in accordance with the well known law  of physics. Everything depends upon the muscles concerned in the  process of respiration, which we may as, for convenience, term the  \"respiratory muscles.\" Without the aid of these muscles the lungs  cannot expand, and upon the proper use and control of these muscles  the Science of Breath largely depends. The proper control of these  muscles will result in the ability to attain the maximum degree of  lung expansion, and the greatest amount of the life giving properties  of the air into the system.    The Yogis classify Respiration into four general methods, viz:         (1) High Breathing.         (2) Mid Breathing.         (3) Low Breathing.         (4) Yogi Complete Breathing.    We will give a general idea of the first three methods, and a more  extended treatment of the fourth method, upon which the Yogi Science  of Breath is largely based.      (1) HIGH BREATHING.    This form of breathing is known to the Western world as Clavicular  Breathing, or Collarbone Breathing. One breathing in this way elevates  the ribs and raises the collarbone and shoulders, at the same time  drawing in the abdomen and pushing its contents up against the  diaphragm, which in turn is raised.    The upper part of the chest and lungs, which is the smallest, is used,  and consequently but a minimum amount of air enters the lungs. In  addition to this, the diaphragm being raised, there can be no  expansion in that direction. A study of the anatomy of the chest will  convince any student that in this way a maximum amount of effort is  used to obtain a minimum amount of benefit.    High Breathing is probably the worst form of breathing known to man  and requires the greatest expenditure of energy with the smallest  amount of benefit. It is an energy-wasting, poor-returns plan. It is  quite common among the Western races, many women being addicted to It,  and even singers, clergymen, lawyers and others, who should know  better, using it ignorantly.    Many diseases of the vocal organs and organs of respiration may be  directly traced to this barbarous method of breathing, and the  straining of delicate organs caused by this method, often results in  the harsh, disagreeable voices heard on all sides. Many persons who  breathe In this way become addicted to the disgusting practice of  \"mouth-breathing\" described in a preceding chapter.    If the student has any doubts about what has been said regarding this  form of breathing, let him try the experiment of expelling all the air  from his lungs, then standing erect, with hands at sides, let him  raise the shoulders and collar-bone and inhale. He will find that the  amount of air inhaled far below normal. Then let him inhale a full  breath, after dropping the shoulders and collar-bone, and he will  receive an object lesson in breathing which he will be apt to remember  much longer than he would any words, printed or spoken.      (2) MID BREATHING.    This method of respiration is known to Western students as Rib  Breathing, or Inter-Costal Breathing, and while less objectionable  than High Breathing, is far inferior to either Low Breathing or to the  Yogi Complete Breath. In Mid Breathing the diaphragm is pushed upward,  and the abdomen drawn in. The ribs are raised somewhat, and the chest  is partially expanded. It is quite common among men who have made no  study of the subject. As there are two better methods known, we give  it only passing notice, and that principally to call your attention to  its short-comings.      (3) LOW BREATHING.    This form of respiration is far better than either of the two  preceding forms: and of recent years many Western writers have  extolled its merits, and have exploited it under the names of  \"Abdominal Breathing,\" \"Deep Breathing,\" \"Diaphragmatic Breathing,\"  etc., etc., and much good has been accomplished by the attention of  the public having been directed to the subject, and many having been  Induced to substitute it for the interior and injurious methods above  alluded to. Many \"systems\" of breathing have been built around Low  Breathing, and students have paid high prices to learn the new (?)  systems. But, as we have said, much good has resulted, and after all  the students who paid high prices to learn revamped old systems  undoubtedly got their money's worth if they were Induced to discard  the old methods of High Breathing and Low Breathing.    Although many Western authorities write and speak of this method as  the best known form of"]]]
