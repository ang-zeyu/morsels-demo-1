Lloyd had sank on a chair, and, gray of face, was staring  blindly at the man he had run against at the office door that morning. His  lips moved in spasms, but there was no sound. The wilted flower fell from  his button-hole to the floor, but he did not move.    \"This is his accomplice,\" Hewitt went on, placing the parrot and cage on  the hall table, \"though I doubt whether there will be any use in charging  _him_. Eh, Polly?\"    The parrot put his head aside and chuckled. \"Hullo, Polly!\" it quietly  gurgled. \"Come along!\"    Sir James Norris was hopelessly bewildered. \"Lloyd--Lloyd,\" he said, under  his breath. \"Lloyd--and that!\"    \"This was his little messenger, his useful Mercury,\" Hewitt explained,  tapping the cage complacently; \"in fact, the actual lifter. Hold him up!\"    The last remark referred to the wretched Lloyd, who had fallen forward  with something between a sob and a loud sigh. The policemen took him by  the arms and propped him in his chair.           *       *       *       *       *    \"System?\" said Hewitt, with a shrug of the shoulders, an hour or two after  in Sir James' study. \"I can't say I have a system. I call it nothing but  common-sense and a sharp pair of eyes. Nobody using these could help  taking the right road in this case. I began at the match, just as the  Scotland Yard man did, but I had the advantage of taking a line through  three cases. To begin with, it was plain that that match, being left there  in daylight, in Mrs. Cazenove's room, could not have been used to light  the table-top, in the full glare of the window; therefore it had been used  for some other purpose--_what_ purpose I could not, at the moment, guess.  Habitual thieves, you know, often have curious superstitions, and some  will never take anything without leaving something behind--a pebble or a  piece of coal, or something like that--in the premises they have been  robbing. It seemed at first extremely likely that this was a case of that  kind. The match had clearly been _brought in_--because, when I asked for  matches, there were none in the stand, not even an empty box, and the room  had not been disturbed. Also the match probably had not been struck there,  nothing having been heard, although, of course, a mistake in this matter  was just possible. This match, then, it was fair to assume, had been lit  somewhere else and blown out immediately--I remarked at the time that it  was very little burned. Plainly it could not have been treated thus for  nothing, and the only possible object would have been to prevent it  igniting accidentally. Following on this, it became obvious that the match  was used, for whatever purpose, not _as_ a match, but merely as a  convenient splinter of wood.    \"So far so good. But on examining the match very closely I observed, as  you can see for yourself, certain rather sharp indentations in the wood.  They are very small, you see, and scarcely visible, except upon narrow  inspection; but there they are, and their positions are regular. See,  there are two on each side, each opposite the corresponding mark of the  other pair. The match, in fact, would seem to have been gripped in some  fairly sharp instrument, holding it at two points above and two below--an  instrument, as it may at once strike you, not unlike the beak of a bird.    \"Now here was an idea. What living creature but a bird could possibly have  entered Mrs. Heath's window without a ladder--supposing no ladder to have  been used--or could have got into Mrs. Armitage's window without lifting  the sash higher than the eight or ten inches it was already open? Plainly,  nothing. Further, it is significant that only _one_ article was stolen at  a time, although others were about. A human being could have carried any  reasonable number, but a bird could only take one at a time. But why  should a bird carry a match in its beak? Certainly it must have been  trained to do that for a purpose, and a little consideration made that  purpose pretty clear. A noisy, chattering bird would probably betray  itself at once. Therefore it must be trained to keep quiet both while  going for and coming away with its plunder. What readier or more probably  effectual way than, while teaching it to carry without dropping, to teach  it also to keep quiet while carrying? The one thing would practically  cover the other.    \"I thought at once, of course, of a jackdaw or a magpie--these birds'  thievish reputations made the guess natural. But the marks on the match  were much too wide apart to have been made by the beak of either. I  conjectured, therefore, that it must be a raven. So that, when we arrived  near the coach-house, I seized the opportunity of a little chat with your  groom on the subject of dogs and pets in general, and ascertained that  there was no tame raven in the place. I also, incidentally, by getting a  light from the coach-house box of matches, ascertained that the match  found was of the sort generally used about the establishment--the large,  thick, red-topped English match. But I further found that Mr. Lloyd had a  parrot which was a most intelligent pet, and had been trained into  comparative quietness--for a parrot. Also, I learned that more than once  the groom had met Mr. Lloyd carrying his parrot under his coat, it having,  as its owner explained, learned the trick of opening its cage-door and  escaping.    \"I said nothing, of course, to you of all this, because I had as yet  nothing but a train of argument and no results. I got to Lloyd's room as  soon as possible. My chief object in going there was achieved when I  played with the parrot, and induced it to bite a quill toothpick.    \"When you left me in the smoking-room, I compared the quill and the match  very carefully, and found that the marks corresponded exactly. After this  I felt very little doubt indeed. The fact of Lloyd having met the ladies  walking before dark on the day of the first robbery proved nothing,  because, since it was clear that the match had _not_ been used to procure  a light, the robbery might as easily have taken place in daylight as  not--must have so taken place, in fact, if my conjectures were right. That  they were right I felt no doubt. There could be no other explanation.    \"When Mrs. Heath left her window open and her door shut, anybody climbing  upon the open sash of Lloyd's high window could have put the bird upon the  sill above. The match placed in the bird's beak for the purpose I have  indicated, and struck first, in case by accident it should ignite by  rubbing against something and startle the bird--this match would, of  course, be dropped just where the object to be removed was taken up; as  you know, in every case the match was found almost upon the spot where the  missing article had been left--scarcely a likely triple coincidence had  the match been used by a human thief. This would have been done as soon  after the ladies had left as possible, and there would then have been  plenty of time for Lloyd to hurry out and meet them before  dark--especially plenty of time to meet them _coming back_, as they must  have been, since they were carrying their ferns. The match was an article  well chosen for its purpose, as being a not altogether unlikely thing to  find on a dressing-table, and, if noticed, likely to lead to the wrong  conclusions adopted by the official detective.    \"In Mrs. Armitage's case the taking of an inferior brooch and the leaving  of a more valuable ring pointed clearly either to the operator being a  fool or unable to distinguish values, and certainly, from other  indications, the thief seemed no fool. The door was locked, and the  gas-fitter, so to speak, on guard, and the window was only eight or ten  inches open and propped with a brush. A human thief entering the window  would have disturbed this arrangement, and would scarcely risk discovery  by attempting to replace it, especially a thief in so great a hurry as to  snatch the brooch up without unfastening the pin. The bird could pass  through the opening as it was, and _would have_ to tear the pin-cushion to  pull the brooch off, probably holding the cushion down with its claw the  while.    \"Now in yesterday's case we had an alteration of conditions. The window  was shut and fastened, but the door was open--but only left for a few  minutes, during which time no sound was heard either of coming or going.  Was it not possible, then, that the thief was _already_ in the room, in  hiding, while Mrs. Cazenove was there, and seized its first opportunity on  her temporary absence? The room is full of draperies, hangings, and what  not, allowing of plenty of concealment for a bird, and a bird could leave  the place noiselessly and quickly. That the whole scheme was strange  mattered not at all. Robberies presenting such unaccountable features must  have been effected by strange means of one sort or another. There was no  improbability. Consider how many hundreds of examples of infinitely higher  degrees of bird-training are exhibited in the London streets every week  for coppers.    \"So that, on the whole, I felt pretty sure of my ground. But before taking  any definite steps I resolved to see if Polly could not be persuaded to  exhibit his accomplishments to an indulgent stranger. For that purpose I  contrived to send Lloyd away again and have a quiet hour alone with his  bird. A piece of sugar, as everybody knows, is a good parrot bribe; but a  walnut, split in half, is a better--especially if the bird be used to it;  so I got you to furnish me with both.

My mother-in-law told me during slavery she was  a field hand. One day the overseer was going to whoop one of the women  'bout sompin or other and all the women started with the hoes to him and  run him clear out of the field. They would killed him if he hadn't got  out of the way. She said the master hadn't put a overseer over them for  a long time. Some of 'em wouldn't do their part and he put one of the  men on the place over the women. He was a colored foreman. The women  worked together and the men worked together in different fields. My  mother-in-law was named Alice Drummond. She said they would cut the  hoecakes in half and put that in your pan, then pour the beef stew on  top. She said on Christmas day they had hot biscuits. They give them  flour and things to make biscuit at home on Sundays. When they got  through eating they take their plate and say, 'Thank God for what I  received.' She said they had plenty milk.

Now I can remember that much. My papa was a bright color  like I am but not near as light as mama. He had a shop when I was little  but he wasn't 'lowed to keep it open on Sunday.
