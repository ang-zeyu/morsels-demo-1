The first sight, however, which it fell to my lot to witness at Brussels  in this second and short visit, was neither gay nor handsome, nor dear  in any sense, but the very reverse; it being that of the punishment of  the guillotine inflicted on a wretched murderer, named John Baptist  Michel.[2] Hearing, at the moment of my arrival, that this tragical  scene was on the point of being acted in the great square of the  market-place, I determined for once to make a sacrifice of my feelings  to the desire of being present at a spectacle, with the nature of which  the recollections of revolutionary horrors are so intimately associated.  Accordingly, following to the spot a guard of soldiers appointed to  assist at the execution, I disengaged myself as soon as possible from  the pressure of the immense crowd already assembled, and obtained a seat  at the window of a house immediately opposite the Hotel-de-Ville, in  front of the principal entrance to which the guillotine had been  erected. At the hour of twelve at noon precisely, the malefactor, tall,  athletic, and young, having his hands tied behind his back, and being  stripped to the waist, was brought to the square in a cart, under an  escort of gen-d'armes, attended by an elderly and respectable  ecclesiastic; who, having been previously occupied in administering the  consolations of religion to the condemned person in prison, now appeared  incessantly employed in tranquillizing him on his way to the scaffold.  Arrived near the fatal machine, the unhappy man stepped out of the  vehicle, knelt at the feet of his confessor, received the priestly  benediction, kissed some individuals who accompanied him, and was  hurried by the officers of justice up the steps of the cube-form  structure of wood, painted of a blood-red, on which stood the dreadful  apparatus of death. To reach the top of the platform, to be fast bound  to a board, to be placed horizontally under the axe, and deprived of  life by its unerring blow, was, in the case of this miserable offender,  the work literally of a moment. It was indeed an awfully sudden transit  from time to eternity. He could only cry out, \"_Adieu, mes amis_,\" and  he was gone. The severed head, passing through a red-coloured bag fixed  under, fell to the ground--the blood spouted forth from the neck like  water from a fountain--the body, lifted up without delay, was flung down  through a trap-door in the platform. Never did capital punishment more  quickly take effect on a human being; and whilst the executioner was  coolly taking out the axe from the groove of the machine, and placing  it, covered as it was with gore, in a box, the remains of the culprit,  deposited in a shell, were hoisted into a wagon, and conveyed to the  prison. In twenty minutes all was over, and the _Grande Place_ nearly  cleared of its thousands, on whom the dreadful scene seemed to have  made, as usual, the slightest possible impression--_Stevenson's Tour in  France, Switzerland, &c._        [2] The circumstances of the case were as follows:--Jean      Baptiste Michel, aged 36, a blacksmith, accompanied by a female      named Marie Anne Debeyst, aged 22, was proceeding from Brussels      to Vilvorde, one day in the month of March, 1824. In the      Alleverte, they overtook a servant girl, who was imprudent      enough to mention to them that her master had entrusted her      with a sum of money. Near Vilvorde, Michel and his paramour,      having formed their plan of assassination and robbery, rejoined      the poor girl, whom they had momentarily left, and violently      demanded the bag containing the gold and silver. The      unfortunate young creature resisted their attacks as long as      she could, but was soon felled to the ground by Michel, who      with a thick stick fractured her skull, whilst Debeyst trod      upon the prostrate victim of their horrid crime. These wretches      were shortly afterwards arrested and committed to prison. On      the 5th of April, 1825, they were condemned to death by the      Court of Assize at Brussels, but implored of the royal clemency      a commutation of punishment. This was granted to the woman,      whose sentence was changed to perpetual imprisonment. Michel's      petition was rejected.           *       *       *       *       *      THE HEIR PRESUMPTIVE.      Of all the miseries of human life, and God knows they are manifold  enough, there are few more utterly heart-sickening and overwhelming than  those endured by the unlucky Heir Presumptive; when, after having  submitted to the whims and caprices of some rich relation, and endured a  state of worse than Egyptian bondage, for a long series of years, he  finds himself cut off with a shilling, or a mourning ring; and the El  Dorado of his tedious term of probation and expectancy devoted to the  endowment of methodist chapels and Sunday schools; or bequeathed to some  six months' friend (usually a female housekeeper, or spiritual adviser)  who, entering the vineyard at the eleventh hour, (the precise moment at  which his patience and humility become exhausted,) carries off the  golden prize, and adds another melancholy confirmation, to those already  upon record, of the fallacy of all human anticipations. It matters  little what may have been the motives of his conduct; whether duty,  affection, or that more powerful incentive self-interest; how long or  how devotedly he may have humoured the foibles or eccentricities of his  relative; or what sacrifices he may have made to enable him to comply  with his unreasonable caprices: the result is almost invariably the  same. The last year of the Heir Presumptive's purgatory, nay, perhaps  even the last month, or the last week, is often the drop to the full cup  of his endurance. His patience, however it may have been propped by  self-interest, or feelings of a more refined description, usually breaks  down before the allotted term has expired; and the whole fabric it has  cost him such infinite labour to erect, falls to the ground along with  it. It is well if his personal exertions, and the annoyances to which he  has subjected himself during the best period of his existence, form the  whole of his sacrifices. But, alas! it too often happens that,  encouraged by the probability of succeeding in a few years to an  independent property, and ambitious, moreover, of making such an  appearance in society as will afford the old gentleman or lady no excuse  for being ashamed of their connexion with him, he launches into expenses  he would never otherwise have dreamed of incurring, and contracts debts  without regard to his positive means of liquidating them, on the  strength of a contingency which, if he could but be taught to believe  it, is of all earthly anticipations the most remote and uncertain. A  passion for unnecessary expense is, under different circumstances,  frequently repressed by an inability to procure credit; but it is the  curse and bane of Mr. Omnium's nephew, and Miss Saveall's niece, that so  far from any obstacle being opposed to their prodigality, almost  unlimited indulgence is offered, nay, actually pressed upon them, by the  trades-people of their wealthy relations; who take especial care that  their charges shall be of a nature to repay them for any complaisance or  long suffering, as it regards the term of credit, they may be called  upon to display. But independently of the additional expense into which  the Heir Presumptive is often seduced by the operation of these  temptations, and his anxiety to live in a style in some degree accordant  with his expectations, what is he not called upon to endure from the  caprices, old-fashioned notions, eccentricities, avarice, and obstinacy,  of the old tyrant to whom he thus consents to sell himself, and it may  be his family, body and soul, for an indefinite number of  years.--_National Tales_.           *       *       *       *       *        THE MONTHS.

BARTON.           *       *       *       *       *      Summer! glowing summer! This is the month of heat and sunshine, of  clear, fervid skies, dusty roads, and shrinking streams; when doors and  windows are thrown open, a cool gale is the most welcome of all  visiters, and every drop of rain \"is worth its weight in gold.\" Such is  July commonly--such it was in 1825, and such, in a scarcely less degree,  in 1826; yet it is sometimes, on the contrary, a very showery month,  putting the hay-maker to the extremity of his patience, and the farmer  upon anxious thoughts for his ripening corn; generally speaking,  however, it is the heart of our summer. The landscape presents an air of  warmth, dryness, and maturity; the eye roams over brown pastures, corn  fields \"already white to harvest,\" dark lines of intersecting  hedge-rows, and darker trees, lifting their heavy heads above them. The  foliage at this period is rich, full, and vigorous; there is a fine haze  cast over distant woods and bosky slopes, and every lofty and majestic  tree is filled with a soft shadowy twilight, which adds infinitely to  its beauty--a circumstance that has never been sufficiently noticed by  either poet or painter. Willows are now beautiful objects in the  landscape; they are like rich masses of arborescent silver, especially  if stirred by the breeze, their light and fluent forms contrasting  finely with the still and sombre aspect of the other trees.    Now is the general season of _haymaking_. Bands of mowers, in their  light trousers and broad straw hats, are astir long before the fiery eye  of the sun glances above the horizon, that they may toil in the  freshness of the morning, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9883"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 10, No. 263, (#4)"],[1,"defended Ajaccio  against the force employed in the expedition.    The strength of Paoli increasing, and the English preparing to assist  him, Corsica became no longer a safe or convenient residence for the  Bonaparte family. Indeed, both Napoleon and his brother Lucien, who had  distinguished themselves as partisans of the French, were subjected to a  decree of banishment from their native island; and Madame Bonaparte,  with her three daughters, and Jerome, who was as yet but a child, set  sail under their protection, and settled for a time, first at Nice, and  afterwards at Marseilles, where the family is supposed to have undergone  considerable distress, until the dawning prospects of Napoleon afforded  him the means of assisting them.    Napoleon never again revisited Corsica, nor does he appear to have  regarded it with any feelings of affection. One small fountain at  Ajaccio is pointed out as the only ornament which his bounty bestowed on  his birthplace. He might perhaps think it impolitic to do any thing  which might remind the country he ruled that he was not a child of her  soil, nay, was in fact very near having been born an alien, for Corsica  was not united to, or made an integral part of France, until June, 1769,  a few weeks only before Napoleon's birth. This stigma was repeatedly  cast upon him by his opponents, some of whom reproached the French with  having adopted a master, from a country from which the ancient Romans  were unwilling even to choose a slave; and Napoleon may have been so far  sensible to it, as to avoid showing any predilection to the place of his  birth, which might bring the circumstance strongly under the observation  of the great nation, with which he and his family seemed to be  indissolubly united. But, as a traveller already quoted, and who had the  best opportunities to become acquainted with the feelings of the proud  islanders, has expressed it,--\"The Corsicans are still highly patriotic,  and possess strong local attachment--in their opinion, contempt for the  country of one's birth is never to be redeemed by any other qualities.  Napoleon, therefore, certainly was not popular in Corsica, nor is his  memory cherished there.\"[7]        [7] Benson's \"Sketches of Corsica,\" p. 121.    The feelings of the parties were not unnatural on either side. Napoleon,  little interested in the land of his birth, and having such an immense  stake in that of his adoption, in which he had every thing to keep and  lose,[8] observed a policy towards Corsica which his position rendered  advisable; and who can blame the high-spirited islanders, who, seeing  one of their countrymen raised to such exalted eminence, and disposed to  forget his connexion with them, returned with slight and indifference  the disregard with which he treated them?        [8] Not literally, however: for it is worth mentioning, that      when he was in full-blown possession of his power, an      inheritance fell to the family, situated near Ajaccio, and was      divided amongst them. The first consul, or emperor, received an      olive-garden as his share.--_Sketches of Corsica_.    The siege of Toulon was the first incident of importance which enabled  Bonaparte to distinguish himself in the eyes of the French government  and of the world at large. Shortly afterwards he was appointed chief of  battalion in the army of Italy, and on the fall of Robespierre,  Bonaparte superseded in command. At the conflict between the troops of  the Convention under Napoleon, and those of the Sections of Paris under  Damican, the latter was defeated with much slaughter, and Bonaparte was  appointed general-in-chief in command of the army of the interior.      BONAPARTE'S FIRST MARRIAGE.    Meantime circumstances, which we will relate according to his own  statement, introduced Bonaparte to an acquaintance, which was destined  to have much influence on his future fate. A fine boy, of ten or twelve  years old, presented himself at the levee of the general of the  interior, with a request of a nature unusually interesting. He stated  his name to be Eugene Beauharnois, son of the ci-devant Vicomte de  Beauharnois, who, adhering to the revolutionary party, had been a  general in the republican service upon the Rhine, and falling under the  causeless suspicion of the committee of public safety, was delivered to  the revolutionary tribunal, and fell by its sentence just four days  before the overthrow of Robespierre. Eugene was come to request of  Bonaparte, as general of the interior, that his father's sword might be  restored to him. The prayer of the young supplicant was as interesting  as his manners were engaging, and Napoleon felt so much interest in him,  that he was induced to cultivate the acquaintance of Eugene's mother,  afterwards the empress Josephine.    The lady was a Creolian, the daughter of a planter in St. Domingo. Her  name at full length was Marie Joseph Rose Tascher de la Pagerie. She had  suffered her share of revolutionary miseries. After her husband, General  Beauharnois, had been deprived of his command, she was arrested as a  suspected person, and detained in prison till the general liberation,  which succeeded the revolution of the 9th Thermidor. While in  confinement, Madame Beauharnois had formed an intimacy with a companion  in distress, Madame Fontenai, now Madame Tallien, from which she derived  great advantages after her friend's marriage. With a remarkably graceful  person, amiable manners, and an inexhaustible fund of good-humour,  Madame Beauharnois was formed to be an ornament to society. Barras, the  Thermidorien hero, himself an ex-noble, was fond of society, desirous of  enjoying it on an agreeable scale, and of washing away the dregs which  Jacobinism had mingled with all the dearest interests of life. He loved  show, too, and pleasure, and might now indulge both without the risk of  falling under the suspicion of incivism, which, in the Reign of Terror,  would have been incurred by any attempt to intermingle elegance with the  enjoyments of social intercourse. At the apartments which he occupied,  as one of the Directory, in the Luxemburg Palace, he gave its free  course to his natural taste, and assembled an agreeable society of both  sexes. Madame Tallien and her friend formed the soul of these  assemblies, and it was supposed that Barras was not insensible to the  charms of Madame Beauharnois,--a rumour which was likely to arise,  whether with or without foundation.    When Madame Beauharnois and General Bonaparte became intimate, the  latter assures us, and we see no reason to doubt him, that although the  lady was two or three years older than himself,[9] yet being still in  the full bloom of beauty, and extremely agreeable in her manners, he was  induced, solely by her personal charms, to make her an offer of his  hand, heart, and fortunes,--little supposing, of course, to what a pitch  the latter were to arise.        [9] Bonaparte was then in his twenty-sixth year. Josephine gave      herself in the marriage contract for twenty-eight.    Although he himself is said to have been a fatalist, believing in  destiny and in the influence of his star, he knew nothing, probably, of  the prediction of a negro sorceress, who, while Marie Joseph was but a  child, prophesied she should rise to a dignity greater than that of a  queen, yet fall from it before her death.[10] This was one of those  vague auguries, delivered at random by fools or impostors, which the  caprice of fortune sometimes matches with a corresponding and conforming  event. But without trusting to the African sibyl's prediction, Bonaparte  may have formed his match under the auspices of ambition as well as  love. The marrying Madame Beauharnois was a mean of uniting his fortune  with those of Barras and Tallien, the first of whom governed France as  one of the Directors; and the last, from talents and political  connexions, had scarcely inferior influence. He had already deserved  well of them for his conduct on the Day of the Sections, but he required  their countenance to rise still higher; and without derogating from the  bride's merits, we may suppose her influence in their society  corresponded with the views of her lover. It is, however, certain, that  he always regarded her with peculiar affection; that he relied on her  fate, which he considered as linked with and strengthening his own; and  reposed, besides, considerable confidence in Josephine's tact and  address in political business. She had at all times the art of  mitigating his temper, and turning aside the hasty determinations of his  angry moments, not by directly opposing, but by gradually parrying and  disarming them. It must be added to her great praise, that she was  always a willing and often a successful advocate in the cause  of humanity.        [10] A lady of high rank, who happened to live for some time in      the same convent at Paris, where Josephine was also a pensioner      or boarder, heard her mention the prophecy, and told it herself      to the author, just about the time of the Italian expedition,      when Bonaparte was beginning to attract notice. Another clause      is usually added to the prediction--that the party whom it      concerned should die in an hospital, which was afterwards      explained as referring to Malmaison. This the author did not      hear from the same authority. The lady mentioned used to speak      in the highest terms of the simple manners and great kindness      of Madame Beauharnois.    They were married 9th of March, 1796; and the dowry of the bride was the  chief command of the Italian armies, a scene which opened a full career  to the ambition of the youthful general. Bonaparte remained with his  wife only three days after his marriage, hastened to see his family, who  were still at Marseilles, and, having enjoyed the pleasure of exhibiting  himself as a favourite of fortune in the city which he had"]]]
