This gave  the young lady time to escape, and enclose herself in her chamber;  while Mr Toobad, rising slowly, and rubbing his knees and shoulders,  said, 'You see, my dear Scythrop, in this little incident, one of the  innumerable proofs of the temporary supremacy of the devil; for what  but a systematic design and concurrent contrivance of evil could have  made the angles of time and place coincide in our unfortunate persons  at the head of this accursed staircase?'    'Nothing else, certainly,' said Scythrop: 'you are perfectly in the  right, Mr Toobad. Evil, and mischief, and misery, and confusion,  and vanity, and vexation of spirit, and death, and disease, and  assassination, and war, and poverty, and pestilence, and famine, and  avarice, and selfishness, and rancour, and jealousy, and spleen,  and malevolence, and the disappointments of philanthropy, and the  faithlessness of friendship, and the crosses of love--all prove the  accuracy of your views, and the truth of your system; and it is not  impossible that the infernal interruption of this fall downstairs may  throw a colour of evil on the whole of my future existence.'    'My dear boy,' said Mr Toobad, 'you have a fine eye for consequences.'    So saying, he embraced Scythrop, who retired, with a disconsolate  step, to dress for dinner; while Mr Toobad stalked across the hall,  repeating, 'Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea, for  the devil is come among you, having great wrath.'           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER IV      The flight of Marionetta, and the pursuit of Scythrop, had been  witnessed by Mr Glowry, who, in consequence, narrowly observed his son  and his niece in the evening; and, concluding from their manner, that  there was a better understanding between them than he wished to see,  he determined on obtaining the next morning from Scythrop a full and  satisfactory explanation. He, therefore, shortly after breakfast,  entered Scythrop's tower, with a very grave face, and said, without  ceremony or preface, 'So, sir, you are in love with your cousin.'    Scythrop, with as little hesitation, answered, 'Yes, sir.'    'That is candid, at least; and she is in love with you.'    'I wish she were, sir.'    'You know she is, sir.'    'Indeed, sir, I do not.'    'But you hope she is.'    'I do, from my soul.'    'Now that is very provoking, Scythrop, and very disappointing: I could  not have supposed that you, Scythrop Glowry, of Nightmare Abbey,  would have been infatuated with such a dancing, laughing, singing,  thoughtless, careless, merry-hearted thing, as Marionetta--in all  respects the reverse of you and me. It is very disappointing,  Scythrop. And do you know, sir, that Marionetta has no fortune?'    'It is the more reason, sir, that her husband should have one.'    'The more reason for her; but not for you. My wife had no fortune, and  I had no consolation in my calamity. And do you reflect, sir, what an  enormous slice this lawsuit has cut out of our family estate? we who  used to be the greatest landed proprietors in Lincolnshire.'    'To be sure, sir, we had more acres of fen than any man on this  coast: but what are fens to love? What are dykes and windmills to  Marionetta?'    'And what, sir, is love to a windmill? Not grist, I am certain:  besides, sir, I have made a choice for you. I have made a choice for  you, Scythrop. Beauty, genius, accomplishments, and a great fortune  into the bargain. Such a lovely, serious creature, in a fine state of  high dissatisfaction with the world, and every thing in it. Such a  delightful surprise I had prepared for you. Sir, I have pledged my  honour to the contract--the honour of the Glowries of Nightmare Abbey:  and now, sir, what is to be done?'    'Indeed, sir, I cannot say. I claim, on this occasion, that liberty of  action which is the co-natal prerogative of every rational being.'    'Liberty of action, sir? there is no such thing as liberty of action.  We are all slaves and puppets of a blind and unpathetic necessity.'    'Very true, sir; but liberty of action, between individuals, consists  in their being differently influenced, or modified, by the same  universal necessity; so that the results are unconsentaneous, and  their respective necessitated volitions clash and fly off in a  tangent.'    'Your logic is good, sir: but you are aware, too, that one individual  may be a medium of adhibiting to another a mode or form of necessity,  which may have more or less influence in the production of  consentaneity; and, therefore, sir, if you do not comply with my  wishes in this instance (you have had your own way in every thing  else), I shall be under the necessity of disinheriting you, though  I shall do it with tears in my eyes.' Having said these words, he  vanished suddenly, in the dread of Scythrop's logic.    Mr Glowry immediately sought Mrs Hilary, and communicated to her his  views of the case in point. Mrs Hilary, as the phrase is, was as fond  of Marionetta as if she had been her own child: but--there is always a  _but_ on these occasions--she could do nothing for her in the way  of fortune, as she had two hopeful sons, who were finishing their  education at Brazen-nose, and who would not like to encounter any  diminution of their prospects, when they should be brought out of the  house of mental bondage--i.e. the university--to the land flowing with  milk and honey--i.e. the west end of London.    Mrs Hilary hinted to Marionetta, that propriety, and delicacy, and  decorum, and dignity, &c. &c. &c.,[3] would require them to leave the  Abbey immediately. Marionetta listened in silent submission, for she  knew that her inheritance was passive obedience; but, when Scythrop,  who had watched the opportunity of Mrs Hilary's departure, entered,  and, without speaking a word, threw himself at her feet in a paroxysm  of grief, the young lady, in equal silence and sorrow, threw her arms  round his neck and burst into tears. A very tender scene ensued, which  the sympathetic susceptibilities of the soft-hearted reader can more  accurately imagine than we can delineate. But when Marionetta hinted  that she was to leave the Abbey immediately, Scythrop snatched from  its repository his ancestor's skull, filled it with Madeira, and  presenting himself before Mr Glowry, threatened to drink off the  contents if Mr Glowry did not immediately promise that Marionetta  should not be taken from the Abbey without her own consent. Mr Glowry,  who took the Madeira to be some deadly brewage, gave the required  promise in dismal panic. Scythrop returned to Marionetta with a joyful  heart, and drank the Madeira by the way.    Mr Glowry, during his residence in London, had come to an agreement  with his friend Mr Toobad, that a match between Scythrop and Mr  Toobad's daughter would be a very desirable occurrence. She was  finishing her education in a German convent, but Mr Toobad described  her as being fully impressed with the truth of his Ahrimanic  philosophy,[4] and being altogether as gloomy and antithalian a young  lady as Mr Glowry himself could desire for the future mistress of  Nightmare Abbey. She had a great fortune in her own right, which was  not, as we have seen, without its weight in inducing Mr Glowry to  set his heart upon her as his daughter-in-law that was to be; he was  therefore very much disturbed by Scythrop's untoward attachment to  Marionetta. He condoled on the occasion with Mr Toobad; who said, that  he had been too long accustomed to the intermeddling of the devil in  all his affairs, to be astonished at this new trace of his cloven  claw; but that he hoped to outwit him yet, for he was sure there could  be no comparison between his daughter and Marionetta in the mind of  any one who had a proper perception of the fact, that, the world  being a great theatre of evil, seriousness and solemnity are the  characteristics of wisdom, and laughter and merriment make a human  being no better than a baboon. Mr Glowry comforted himself with this  view of the subject, and urged Mr Toobad to expedite his daughter's  return from Germany. Mr Toobad said he was in daily expectation of her  arrival in London, and would set off immediately to meet her, that  he might lose no time in bringing her to Nightmare Abbey. 'Then,' he  added, 'we shall see whether Thalia or Melpomene--whether the Allegra  or the Penserosa--will carry off the symbol of victory.'--'There can  be no doubt,' said Mr Glowry, 'which way the scale will incline, or  Scythrop is no true scion of the venerable stem of the Glowries.'           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER V      Marionetta felt secure of Scythrop's heart; and notwithstanding the  difficulties that surrounded her, she could not debar herself from the  pleasure of tormenting her lover, whom she kept in a perpetual fever.  Sometimes she would meet him with the most unqualified affection;  sometimes with the most chilling indifference; rousing him to anger by  artificial coldness--softening him to love by eloquent tenderness--or  inflaming him to jealousy by coquetting with the Honourable Mr  Listless, who seemed, under her magical influence, to burst into  sudden life, like the bud of the evening primrose. Sometimes she would  sit by the piano, and listen with becoming attention to Scythrop's  pathetic remonstrances; but, in the most impassioned part of his  oratory, she would convert all his ideas into a chaos, by striking up  some Rondo Allegro, and saying, 'Is it not pretty?' Scythrop would  begin to storm; and she would answer him with,      'Zitti, zitti, piano, piano,    Non facciamo confusione,'    or some similar _facezia_, till he would start away from her, and  enclose himself in his tower, in an agony of agitation, vowing to  renounce her, and her whole sex, for ever; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9914"],[0,"The Babylonian Legends of the Creation (#4)"],[1," which was drawn by four horses, he went  out to meet and defeat Tiamat. It seems pretty certain that this  description of the equipment of Marduk was taken over from a very  ancient account of the Fight with Tiamat in which the hero was Enlil,  i.e., the god of the air, or of the region which lies between heaven  and hell. Marduk approached and looked upon the \"Middle\" or \"Inside\" or  \"Womb\" of Tiamat [1], and divined the plan of Kingu who had taken up his  place therein. In the Seventh Tablet (l. 108) Marduk is said to have  \"entered into the middle of Tiamat,\" and because he did so he is called  \"Nibiru,\" i.e., \"he who entered in,\" and the \"seizer of the middle.\"  What the words \"middle of Tiamat\" meant to the Babylonian we are not  told, but it is clear that Marduk's entry into it was a signal mark of  the triumph of the god. When Kingu from the \"middle of Tiamat\" saw  Marduk arrayed in his terrible panoply of war, he was terrified and  trembled, and staggered about and lost all control of his legs; and at  the mere sight of the god all the other fiends and devils were smitten  with fear and reduced to helplessness. Tiamat saw Marduk and began to  revile him, and when he challenged her to battle she flew into a rage  and attempted to overthrow him by reciting an incantation, thinking that  her words of power would destroy his strength. Her spell had no effect  on the god, who at once cast his net over her. At the same moment he  made a gale of foul wind to blow on her face, and entering through her  mouth it filled her body; whilst her body was distended he drove his  spear into her, and Tiamat split asunder, and her womb fell out from it.  Marduk leaped upon her body and looked on her followers as they  attempted to escape. But the Four Winds which he had stationed round  about Tiamat made all their efforts to flee of no effect. Marduk caught  all the Eleven allies of Tiamat in his net, and he trampled upon them as  they lay in it helpless. Marduk then took the TABLET OF DESTINIES from  Kingu's breast, and sealed it with his seal and placed it on his  own breast.    [Footnote 1: Or perhaps the \"belly of Tiamat.\" The Egyptians  distinguished a portion of the heavens by the name of \"Khat Nut,\" \"the  belly of Nut,\" [Heiroglyphics] and two drawings of it are extant.  The  first shows an oval object rimmed with stars and the other a  pear-shaped object, with a god inside it. (See Brugsch, _Inschriften  (Astronomische)_ Leipzig, 1883, p, 146.)  [Illustration]]    Then returning to the dead body of Tiamat he smashed her skull with  his club and scattered her blood to the north wind, and as a reward  for his destruction of their terrible foe, he received gifts and  presents from the gods his fathers.    The text then goes on to say that Marduk \"devised a cunning plan,\"  i.e., he determined to carry out a series of works of creation. He  split the body of Tiamat into two parts; out of one half he fashioned  the dome of heaven, and out of the other he constructed the abode of  Nudimmud, or Ea, which he placed over against Apsu, i.e., the deep. He  also formulated regulations concerning the maintenance of the same. By  this \"cunning plan\" Marduk deprived the powers of darkness of the  opportunity of repeating their revolt with any chance of success. Having  established the framework of his new heaven and earth Marduk, acting as  the celestial architect, set to work to furnish them. In the first place  he founded E-Sharra, or the mansion of heaven, and next he set apart and  arranged proper places for the old gods of the three realms--Anu,  Bel and Ea.    [Illustration: Tablet sculptured with a scene representing the worship  of the Sun-god in the Temple of Sippar. The Sun-god is seated on a  throne within a pavilion holding in one hand a disk and bar which may  symbolize eternity. Above his head are the three symbols of the Moon,  the Sun, and the planet Venus. On a stand in front of the pavilion rests  the disk of the Sun, which is held in position by ropes grasped in the  hands of two divine beings who are supported by the roof of the  pavilion. The pavilion of the Sun-god stands on the Celestial Ocean, and  the four small disks indicate either the four cardinal points or the  tops of the pillars of the heavens. The three figures in front of the  disk represent the high priest of Shamash, the king (Nabu-aplu-iddina,  about 870 B.C.) and an attendant goddess. [No. 91,000.]]    The text of the Fifth Tablet, which would undoubtedly have supplied  details as to Marduk's arrangement and regulations for the sun, the  moon, the stars, and the Signs of the Zodiac in the heavens is wanting.  The prominence of the celestial bodies in the history of creation is not  to be wondered at, for the greater number of the religious beliefs of  the Babylonians are grouped round them. Moreover, the science of  astronomy had gone hand in hand with the superstition of astrology in  Mesopotamia from time immemorial; and at a very early period the oldest  gods of Babylonia were associated with the heavenly bodies. Thus the  Annunaki and the Igigi, who are bodies of deified spirits, were  identified with the stars of the northern and southern heaven,  respectively. And all the primitive goddesses coalesced and were grouped  to form the goddess Ishtar, who was identified with the Evening and  Morning Star, or Venus. The Babylonians believed that the will of the  gods was made known to men by the motions of the planets, and that  careful observation of them would enable the skilled seer to recognize  in the stars favourable and unfavourable portents. Such observations,  treated from a magical point of view, formed a huge mass of literature  which was being added to continually. From the nature of the case this  literature enshrined a very considerable number of facts of pure  astronomy, and as early as the period of the First Dynasty (about 2000  B.C.), the Babylonians were able to calculate astronomical events with  considerable accuracy, and to reconcile the solar and lunar years by the  use of epagomenal months. They had by that time formulated the existence  of the Zodiac, and fixed the \"stations\" of the moon, and the places of  the planets with it; and they had distinguished between the planets and  the fixed stars. In the Fifth Tablet of the Creation Series (l. 2) the  Signs of the Zodiac are called _Lumashi_ [1], but unfortunately no list  of their names is given in the context. Now these are supplied by the  little tablet (No. 77,821) of the Persian Period of which a reproduction  is here given. It has been referred to and discussed by various  scholars, and its importance is very great. The transcript of the text,  which is now published (see p. 68) for the first time, will be  acceptable to the students of the history of the Zodiac. Egyptian,  Greek, Syriac and Arabic astrological and astronomical texts all  associate with the Signs of the Zodiac twelve groups, each containing  three stars, which are commonly known as the \"Thirty-six Dekans.\" [2]  The text of line 4 of the Fifth Tablet of the Creation Series proves  that the Babylonians were acquainted with these groups of stars, for we  read that Marduk \"set up for the twelve months of the year three stars  apiece.\" In the List of Signs of the Zodiac here given, it will be seen  that each Sign is associated with a particular month.    [Footnote 1: This is the original of the Syriac word for the Signs of  the Zodiac _malwashe_ (plural of _malwasha_). The Syrians  added to it an _m_, thus giving it a participial form.]    [Footnote 2: [Greek: Dekanoi] also called [Greek: prosopa], [Greek:  horoskopoi], [Greek: philokes] and [Greek: episkopoi].  They were well  known to the Egyptians, who, as early as the fourteenth century B.C.,  possessed a full list of them.  See Lepsius, _Chronologie_,  Berlin, 1848, and Brugsch, _Thesaurus (Astronomische und  Astrologische Inschriften)_, Leipzig, 1883.]    [Illustration: Tablet inscribed with a list of the Signs of the  Zodiac. [No. 77,821.]]    At a later period, say about 500 B.C., the Babylonians made some of  the gods regents of groups of stars, for Enlil ruled 33 stars, Anu 23  stars, and Ea 15 stars. They also possessed lists of the fixed stars,  and drew up tables of the times of their heliacal risings. Such lists  were probably based upon very ancient documents, and prove that the  astral element in Babylonian religion was very considerable.    The accompanying illustration, which is reproduced from the Boundary  Stone of Ritti-Marduk (Brit. Mus., No. 90,858), supplies much  information about the symbols of the gods, and of the Signs of the  Zodiac in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I, King of Babylon, about 1120  B.C.. Thus in Register 1, we have the Star of Ishtar, the crescent of  the Moon-god Sin, and the disk of Shamash the Sun-god. In Reg. 2 are  three stands (?) surmounted by tiaras, which represent the gods Anu,  Enlil (Bel) and Ea respectively. In Reg. 3 are three altars (?) or  shrines (?) with a monster in Nos. 1 and 2. Over the first is the  lance of Marduk, over the second the mason's square of Nabu, and over  the third is the symbol of the goddess Ninkharsag, the Creatress. In  Reg. 4 are a standard with an animal's head, a sign of Ea; a  two-headed snake = the Twins; an unknown symbol with a horse's head,  and a bird, representative of Shukamuna and Shumalia. In Reg. 5 are a  seated figure of the goddess Gula and the Scorpion-man; and in Reg. 6  are forked lightning, symbol of Adad, above a bull, the Tortoise,  symbol of Ea (?), the Scorpion of the goddess Ishkhara, and the Lamp  of Nusku, the Fire-god. Down the left-hand side is the serpent-god  representing the constellation of the Hydra.    The mutilated text of the Fifth Tablet makes it impossible to gain  further details in connection with Marduk's work in arranging the  heavens. We are, however, justified in assuming that the gaps in it  contained statements about the"]]]
