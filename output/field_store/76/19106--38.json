We have said that he kept a good table; for presents of  game poured in from the gentlemen's bailiffs in the neighbourhood, fish  from town to be repaid by summer visits, and if the fishmonger of the  place was overstocked, the first person he sent to was our bookseller.  Again, he would take a post-chaise, or the White Hart barouche, for a  party of pleasure, when his neighbours would have been happy with a gig.  He did not join, or allow his daughters to mix with them at the tradesman's  ball, but they staid moping at home, because there was none between the  gentry and trade. Yet the professional and little-fortune people  cried ---- trade, and thus our bookseller belonged to neither class. The  people of the place know not whether he is rich; he has been \"making money\"  all his life-time say they, but he has \"lived away.\" It is, however, to be  regretted that they cannot settle the point, since they determine to a  pound the income of every gentleman and lady in the neighbourhood, and,  doff their hats according to the total.    To sum up his character, he is just and sometimes generous; hospitable but  not unostentatious; dictatorial and circumlocutory to excess in his  conversation, and of an inquisitive turn of mind, and considering his  resources, he is well informed and even clever in matters of the world; in  short, he is a perfect pattern of the gentleman tradesmen of the present  day.    PHILO.           *       *       *       *       *          NOTES OF A READER.           *       *       *       *       *      EMIGRATION.      A pamphlet of _Twenty-four Letters from Labourers in America to their  Friends in England_, has lately reached our hands. These letters have been  addressed by emigrants to their relatives in the eastern part of Sussex,  and have been printed _literatim_. We are aware of the strong prejudice  which exists against the practice of parishes sending off annually, a part  of their surplus population to America; but some of the statements in  these letters will stagger the _Noes_. We quote a few from letters written  during the past year:      _Brooklyn, Jan._ 14, 1828.    John is at work as carpenter, for the winter; his Boss gives him 5_s_.  a day, our money, which is little more than 2_s_. 6_d_, English money.  They tell us that winter is a dead time in America; but we have found it  as well and better than we expected. We can get good flour for 11_d_.  English money; good beef for 2_d_. or 3_d_ do, and mutton the same  price; pork about 4_d_.; sugar, very good, 5_d_.; butter and cheese is  not much cheaper than in England; clothing is rather dear, especially  woollen; worsted stockings are dear.      _New Hereford, June_ 30, 1828.    Dear Father and Mother,    I now take the opportunity of writing to you since our long journey. But  I am very sorry to tell you, that we had the misfortune to lose both our  little boys; Edward died 29th April, and William 5th May; the younger died  with bowel complaint; the other with the rash-fever and sore throat. We  were very much hurt to have them buried in a watery grave; we mourned  their loss; night and day they were not out of our minds. We had a  minister on board, who prayed with us twice a day; he was a great comfort  to us, on the account of losing our poor little children. He said, The  Lord gave, and taketh away; and blessed be the name of the Lord. We should  make ourselves contented if we had our poor little children here with us:  we kept our children 24 hours. There were six children and one woman died  in the vessel. Master Bran lost his wife. Mrs. Coshman, from Bodiam, lost  her two only children. My sister Mary and her two children are living at  Olbourn, about 80 miles from us. Little Caroline and father is living with  us; and our three brothers are living within a mile of us. Brother James  was very ill coming over, with the same complaint that William had. We  were very sick for three weeks, coming over: John was very hearty, and  so was father. We were afraid we should loose little Caroline; but the  children and we are hearty at this time. Sarah and Caroline are often  speaking of going to see their grandmother. Mary's children were all well,  except little John; he was bad with a great cold. I have got a house and  employ. I have 4_s_. a day and my board; and in harvest and haying I am to  have 6_s_. or 7_s_. a day and my board. We get wheat for 7_s_. per bushel,  of our money; that is about 3_s_. 7_d_. of your money; meat is about 3_d_.  per pound; butter from 5_d_. to 6_d_.; sugar about the same as in England;  shoes and clothes about the same as it is with you; tea is from 2_s_. 6_d_.  3_s_. 6_d_. of your money; tobacco is about 9_d_. per pound, of your money;  good whisky about 1_s_. 1_d_. per gallon; that is 2_s_. of your money.      _Hudson State, New York, July_ 6, 1828.    I must tell you a little what friends we met with when we landed in to  Hudson; such friends as we never found in England; but it was chiefly from  that people that love and fear God. We had so much meat brought us, that  we could not eat while it was good; a whole quarter of a calf at once; so  we had two or three quarters in a little time, and seven stone of beef.  One old gentleman came and brought us a wagon load of wood, and two chucks  of bacon; some sent flour, some bread, some cheese, some soap, some  candles, some chairs, some bedsteads. One class-leader sent us 3_s_. worth  of tin ware and many other things. The flowers are much here as yours;  provision is not very cheap; flour is 1_s_. 7_d_. a gallon of this money,  about 10_d_. of yours; butter is 1_s_., your money 6_d_.; meat from 2_d_.  to 6_d_., yours 1_d_. to 3_d_.; sugar 10_d_. to 1_s_. yours 5_d_. and 6_d_.  Tell father I wish I could send him nine or ten pound of tobacco; for it  is 1_s_. a pound; I chaws rarely.      _Constantia, Dec._ 2, 1828.    Dear Children,    I now write for the third time since I left old England. I wrote a letter,  dated October 8th; and finding that it would have four weeks to lay, I was  afraid you would not have it; and as I told you I would write the truth,  if I was forced to beg my bread from door to door, so I now proceed.  Dear children, I write to let you know that we are all in good health,  excepting your mother; and she is now just put to bed of another son, and  she is as well as can be expected. And now as it respects what I have got  in America: I have got 12-1/2 acres of land, about half improved, and the  rest in the state of nature, and two cows of my own. We can buy good land  for 18_s_. per acre; but buying of land is not one quarter part, for the  land is as full of trees as your woods are of stubs; and they are from  four to ten rods long, and from one to five feet through them. You may buy  land here from 18_s_. to 9_l_. in English money; and it will bring from 20  to 40 bushels of wheat per acre, and corn from 20 to 50 bushels per acre,  and rye from 20 to 40 ditto. You may buy beef for 1-3/4_d_. per pound; and  mutton the same; Irish butter 7_d_. per pound; cheese 3_d_.; tea 4_s_.  6_d_.; sugar 7_d_. per pound; candles 7_d_.; soap 7_d_.; and wheat 4_s_.  6_d_. per bushel; corn and rye 2_s_. per bushel. And I get 2_s_. 4_d_. a  day and my board; and have as much meat to eat, three times a day, as I  like to eat. But clothing is dear; shoes 8_s_.; half boots 16_s_.; calico  from 8_d_. to 1_s_. 4_d_.; stockings 2_s_. 9_d_. to 3_s_. 6_d_.; flannel  4_s_. per yard; superfine cloth from 4_s_. 6_d_. to 1_l_.; now all this is  counted in English money. We get 4_s_. per day in summer, and our board;  and if you count the difference of the money, you will soon find it out;  8_s_. in our money is 4_s_. 6_d_. in your money.    The reader will perhaps think we give only the \"milk and honey\" of these  letters, but they bear the stamp of authenticity.           *       *       *       *       *      KENILWORTH.      Every body knows the delightful romance of Kenilworth,--a tragedy, of  which the dramatis personae are the parties themselves, called up from  their graves by the novelist magician. Students who attend St. Mary's  Church, Oxford, still look out for the flat stone which covers the dust  and bones of poor Amy, and could any sculptured effigies supply the place  of the whole historical picture, then imagined in the mind's eye? More  than once attracted by the old ballad,[1] we have, when undergraduates,  walked to the \"lonely towers of Cumnor Hall,\" fancied that we saw her  struggle, and heard her screams, when she was thrown over the staircase  (the traditional mode of her assassination,) and wondered how any man  could have the heart to murder a simple lovesick pretty girl. Even now,  in sorrow and in sadness, we read this account:--    The unfortunate Amye Duddley (for so she subscribes herself in the  Harleian Manuscript, 4712,) the first wife of Lord Robert Dudley, Queen  Elizabeth's favourite, and after Amy's death Earl of Leicester, was  daughter of Sir John Robsart. Her marriage took place June 4, 1550, the  day following that on which her lord's eldest brother had been united to a  daughter of the Duke of Somerset, and the event is thus recorded by King  Edward in his Diary: \"4. S. Robert dudeley, third sonne to th' erle of  warwic, married S. John Robsartes daughter; after wich mariage ther were  certain gentlemen that did strive who shuld first take away a gose's heade  wich was hanged alive on tow crose postes.\" Soon after the accession of  Elizabeth, when Dudley's ambitious views of a royal alliance had opened  upon him, his countess mysteriously died at the retired mansion of Cumnor  near Abingdon,[2] Sept. 8, 1560; and, although the mode of her death is  imperfectly ascertained (her body was thrown down stairs, as a blind,)  there appears far greater foundation for supposing the earl guilty of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11352"],[0,"Germany and the Next War (#5)"],[1,"ires,    In order to possess it, must be won.\"    The procedure of Italy in Tripoli furnishes an example of such  conditions, while Germany in the Morocco question could not rouse  herself to a similar resolution.[C]    [Footnote C: This does not imply that Germany could and ought to have  occupied part of Morocco. On more than one ground I think that it was  imperative to maintain the actual sovereignty of this State on the basis  of the Algeciras Convention. Among other advantages, which need not be  discussed here, Germany would have had the country secured to her as a  possible sphere of colonization. That would have set up justifiable  claims for the future.]    In such cases might gives the right to occupy or to conquer. Might is at  once the supreme right, and the dispute as to what is right is decided  by the arbitrament of war. War gives a biologically just decision, since  its decisions rest on the very nature of things.    Just as increase of population forms under certain circumstances a  convincing argument for war, so industrial conditions may compel the  same result.    In America, England, Germany, to mention only the chief commercial  countries, industries offer remunerative work to great masses of the  population. The native population cannot consume all the products of  this work. The industries depend, therefore, mainly on exportation. Work  and employment are secured so long as they find markets which gladly  accept their products, since they are paid for by the foreign country.  But this foreign country is intensely interested in liberating itself  from such tribute, and in producing itself all that it requires. We  find, therefore, a general endeavour to call home industries into  existence, and to protect them by tariff barriers; and, on the other  hand, the foreign country tries to keep the markets open to itself, to  crush or cripple competing industries, and thus to retain the consumer  for itself or win fresh ones. It is an embittered struggle which rages  in the market of the world. It has already often assumed definite  hostile forms in tariff wars, and the future will certainly intensify  this struggle. Great commercial countries will, on the one hand, shut  their doors more closely to outsiders, and countries hitherto on the  down-grade will develop home industries, which, under more favourable  conditions of labour and production, will be able to supply goods  cheaper than those imported from the old industrial States. These latter  will see their position in these world markets endangered, and thus it  may well happen that an export country can no longer offer satisfactory  conditions of life to its workers. Such a State runs the danger not only  of losing a valuable part of its population by emigration, but of also  gradually falling from its supremacy in the civilized and political  world through diminishing production and lessened profits.    In this respect we stand to-day at the threshold of a development. We  cannot reject the possibility that a State, under the necessity of  providing remunerative work for its population, may be driven into war.  If more valuable advantages than even now is the case had been at stake  in Morocco, and had our export trade been seriously menaced, Germany  would hardly have conceded to France the most favourable position in the  Morocco market without a struggle. England, doubtless, would not shrink  from a war to the knife, just as she fought for the ownership of the  South African goldfields and diamond-mines, if any attack threatened her  Indian market, the control of which is the foundation of her world  sovereignty. The knowledge, therefore, that war depends on biological  laws leads to the conclusion that every attempt to exclude it from  international relations must be demonstrably untenable. But it is not  only a biological law, but a moral obligation, and, as such, an  indispensable factor in civilization.    The attitude which is adopted towards this idea is closely connected  with the view of life generally.    If we regard the life of the individual or of the nation as something  purely material, as an incident which terminates in death and outward  decay, we must logically consider that the highest goal which man can  attain is the enjoyment of the most happy life and the greatest possible  diminution of all bodily suffering. The State will be regarded as a sort  of assurance office, which guarantees a life of undisturbed possession  and enjoyment in the widest meaning of the word. We must endorse the  view which Wilhelm von Humboldt professed in his treatise on the limits  of the activity of the State.[D] The compulsory functions of the State  must be limited to the assurance of property and life. The State will be  considered as a law-court, and the individual will be inclined to shun  war as the greatest conceivable evil.    [Footnote D: W. von Humboldt, \"Ideen zu einem Versuch, die Grenzen der  Wirksamkelt des Staates zu bestimmen.\"]    If, on the contrary, we consider the life of men and of States as merely  a fraction of a collective existence, whose final purpose does not rest  on enjoyment, but on the development of intellectual and moral powers,  and if we look upon all enjoyment merely as an accessory of the  chequered conditions of life, the task of the State will appear in a  very different light. The State will not be to us merely a legal and  social insurance office, political union will not seem to us to have the  one object of bringing the advantages of civilization within the reach  of the individual; we shall assign to it the nobler task of raising the  intellectual and moral powers of a nation to the highest expansion, and  of securing for them that influence on the world which tends to the  combined progress of humanity. We shall see in the State, as Fichte  taught, an exponent of liberty to the human race, whose task it is to  put into practice the moral duty on earth. \"The State,\" says Treitschke,  \"is a moral community. It is called upon to educate the human race by  positive achievement, and its ultimate object is that a nation should  develop in it and through it into a real character; that is, alike for  nation and individuals, the highest moral task.\"    This highest expansion can never be realized in pure individualism. Man  can only develop his highest capacities when he takes his part in a  community, in a social organism, for which he lives and works. He must  be in a family, in a society, in the State, which draws the individual  out of the narrow circles in which he otherwise would pass his life, and  makes him a worker in the great common interests of humanity. The State  alone, so Schleiermacher once taught, gives the individual the highest  degree of life.[E]    [Footnote E: To expand the idea of the State into that of humanity, and  thus to entrust apparently higher duties to the individual, leads to  error, since in a human race conceived as a whole struggle and, by  Implication, the most essential vital principle would be ruled out. Any  action in favour of collective humanity outside the limits of the State  and nationality is impossible. Such conceptions belong to the wide  domain of Utopias.]    War, from this standpoint, will be regarded as a moral necessity, if it  is waged to protect the highest and most valuable interests of a nation.  As human life is now constituted, it is political idealism which calls  for war, while materialism--in theory, at least--repudiates it.    If we grasp the conception of the State from this higher aspect, we  shall soon see that it cannot attain its great moral ends unless its  political power increases. The higher object at which it aims is  closely correlated to the advancement of its material interests. It is  only the State which strives after an enlarged sphere of influence that  creates the conditions under which mankind develops into the most  splendid perfection. The development of all the best human capabilities  and qualities can only find scope on the great stage of action which  power creates. But when the State renounces all extension of power, and  recoils from every war which is necessary for its expansion; when it is  content to exist, and no longer wishes to grow; when \"at peace on  sluggard's couch it lies,\" then its citizens become stunted. The efforts  of each individual are cramped, and the broad aspect of things is lost.  This is sufficiently exemplified by the pitiable existence of all small  States, and every great Power that mistrusts itself falls victim to the  same curse.    All petty and personal interests force their way to the front during a  long period of peace. Selfishness and intrigue run riot, and luxury  obliterates idealism. Money acquires an excessive and unjustifiable  power, and character does not obtain due respect:        \"Man is stunted by peaceful days,    In idle repose his courage decays.    Law is the weakling's game.    Law makes the world the same.    But in war man's strength is seen,    War ennobles all that is mean;    Even the coward belies his name.\"                   SCHILLER: _Braut v. Messina_.    \"Wars are terrible, but necessary, for they save the State from social  petrifaction and stagnation. It is well that the transitoriness of the  goods of this world is not only preached, but is learnt by experience.  War alone teaches this lesson.\" [F]    [Footnote F: Kuno Fischer, \"Hegel,\" i., p. 737.]    War, in opposition to peace, does more to arouse national life and to  expand national power than any other means known to history. It  certainly brings much material and mental distress in its train, but at  the same time it evokes the noblest activities of the human nature. This  is especially so under present-day conditions, when it can be regarded  not merely as the affair of Sovereigns and Governments, but as the  expression of the united will of a whole nation.
