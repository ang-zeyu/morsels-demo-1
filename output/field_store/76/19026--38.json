All that second day they traveled steadily, entertaining one another  the while with stories of adventures they had formerly met and  listening to the Scarecrow recite poetry. He had learned a great many  poems from Professor Wogglebug and loved to repeat them whenever  anybody would listen to him. Of course Woot and the Tin Woodman now  listened, because they could not do otherwise--unless they rudely ran  away from their stuffed comrade. One of the Scarecrow's recitations was  like this:        \"What sound is so sweet      As the straw from the wheat    When it crunkles so tender and low?      It is yellow and bright,      So it gives me delight    To crunkle wherever I go.        \"Sweet, fresh, golden Straw!      There is surely no flaw    In a stuffing so clean and compact.      It creaks when I walk,      And it thrills when I talk,    And its fragrance is fine, for a fact.      \"To cut me don't hurt,        For I've no blood to squirt,    And I therefore can suffer no pain;      The straw that I use      Doesn't lump up or bruise,    Though it's pounded again and again!        \"I know it is said      That my beautiful head    Has brains of mixed wheat-straw and bran,      But my thoughts are so good      I'd not change, if I could,    For the brains of a common meat man.        \"Content with my lot,      I'm glad that I'm not    Like others I meet day by day;      If my insides get musty,      Or mussed-up, or dusty,    I get newly stuffed right away.\"          Chapter Four    The Loons of Loonville      Toward evening, the travelers found there was no longer a path to guide  them, and the purple hues of the grass and trees warned them that they  were now in the Country of the Gillikins, where strange peoples dwelt  in places that were quite unknown to the other inhabitants of Oz. The  fields were wild and uncultivated and there were no houses of any sort  to be seen. But our friends kept on walking even after the sun went  down, hoping to find a good place for Woot the Wanderer to sleep; but  when it grew quite dark and the boy was weary with his long walk, they  halted right in the middle of a field and allowed Woot to get his  supper from the food he carried in his knapsack. Then the Scarecrow  laid himself down, so that Woot could use his stuffed body as a pillow,  and the Tin Woodman stood up beside them all night, so the dampness of  the ground might not rust his joints or dull his brilliant polish.  Whenever the dew settled on his body he carefully wiped it off with a  cloth, and so in the morning the Emperor shone as brightly as ever in  the rays of the rising sun.    They wakened the boy at daybreak, the Scarecrow saying to him:    \"We have discovered something queer, and therefore we must counsel  together what to do about it.\"    \"What have you discovered?\" asked Woot, rubbing the sleep from his eyes  with his knuckles and giving three wide yawns to prove he was fully  awake.    \"A Sign,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"A Sign, and another path.\"    \"What does the Sign say?\" inquired the boy.    \"It says that 'All Strangers are Warned not to Follow this Path to  Loonville,'\" answered the Scarecrow, who could read very well when his  eyes had been freshly painted.    \"In that case,\" said the boy, opening his knapsack to get some  breakfast, \"let us travel in some other direction.\"    But this did not seem to please either of his companions.    \"I'd like to see what Loonville looks like,\" remarked the Tin Woodman.    \"When one travels, it is foolish to miss any interesting sight,\" added  the Scarecrow.    \"But a warning means danger,\" protested Woot the Wanderer, \"and I  believe it sensible to keep out of danger whenever we can.\"    They made no reply to this speech for a while. Then said the Scarecrow:    \"I have escaped so many dangers, during my lifetime, that I am not much  afraid of anything that can happen.\"    \"Nor am I!\" exclaimed the Tin Woodman, swinging his glittering axe  around his tin head, in a series of circles. \"Few things can injure  tin, and my axe is a powerful weapon to use against a foe. But our boy  friend,\" he continued, looking solemnly at Woot, \"might perhaps be  injured if the people of Loonville are really dangerous; so I propose  he waits here while you and I, Friend Scarecrow, visit the forbidden  City of Loonville.\"    \"Don't worry about me,\" advised Woot, calmly. \"Wherever you wish to go,  I will go, and share your dangers. During my wanderings I have found it  more wise to keep out of danger than to venture in, but at that time I  was alone, and now I have two powerful friends to protect me.\"    So, when he had finished his breakfast, they all set out along the path  that led to Loonville.    \"It is a place I have never heard of before,\" remarked the Scarecrow,  as they approached a dense forest. \"The inhabitants may be people, of  some sort, or they may be animals, but whatever they prove to be, we  will have an interesting story to relate to Dorothy and Ozma on our  return.\"    The path led into the forest, but the big trees grew so closely  together and the vines and underbrush were so thick and matted that  they had to clear a path at each step in order to proceed. In one or  two places the Tin Man, who went first to clear the way, cut the  branches with a blow of his axe. Woot followed next, and last of the  three came the Scarecrow, who could not have kept the path at all had  not his comrades broken the way for his straw-stuffed body.    Presently the Tin Woodman pushed his way through some heavy underbrush,  and almost tumbled headlong into a vast cleared space in the forest.  The clearing was circular, big and roomy, yet the top branches of the  tall trees reached over and formed a complete dome or roof for it.  Strangely enough, it was not dark in this immense natural chamber in  the woodland, for the place glowed with a soft, white light that seemed  to come from some unseen source.    In the chamber were grouped dozens of queer creatures, and these so  astonished the Tin Man that Woot had to push his metal body aside, that  he might see, too. And the Scarecrow pushed Woot aside, so that the  three travelers stood in a row, staring with all their eyes.    The creatures they beheld were round and ball-like; round in body,  round in legs and arms, round in hands and feet and round of head.  The  only exception to the roundness was a slight hollow on the top of each  head, making it saucer-shaped instead of dome-shaped. They wore no  clothes on their puffy bodies, nor had they any hair. Their skins were  all of a light gray color, and their eyes were mere purple spots. Their  noses were as puffy as the rest of them.    \"Are they rubber, do you think?\" asked the Scarecrow, who noticed that  the creatures bounded, as they moved, and seemed almost as light as air.    \"It is difficult to tell what they are,\" answered Woot, \"they seem to  be covered with warts.\"    The Loons--for so these folks were called--had been doing many things,  some playing together, some working at tasks and some gathered in  groups to talk; but at the sound of strange voices, which echoed rather  loudly through the clearing, all turned in the direction of the  intruders.  Then, in a body, they all rushed forward, running and  bounding with tremendous speed.    The Tin Woodman was so surprised by this sudden dash that he had no  time to raise his axe before the Loons were on them. The creatures  swung their puffy hands, which looked like boxing-gloves, and pounded  the three travelers as hard as they could, on all sides. The blows were  quite soft and did not hurt our friends at all, but the onslaught quite  bewildered them, so that in a brief period all three were knocked over  and fell flat upon the ground. Once down, many of the Loons held them,  to prevent their getting up again, while others wound long tendrils of  vines about them, binding their arms and legs to their bodies and so  rendering them helpless.    \"Aha!\" cried the biggest Loon of all; \"we've got 'em safe; so let's  carry 'em to King Bal and have 'em tried, and condemned and  perforated!\" They had to drag their captives to the center of the domed  chamber, for their weight, as compared with that of the Loons,  prevented their being carried. Even the Scarecrow was much heavier than  the puffy Loons. But finally the party halted before a raised platform,  on which stood a sort of throne, consisting of a big, wide chair with a  string tied to one arm of it. This string led upward to the roof of the  dome.    Arranged before the platform, the prisoners were allowed to sit up,  facing the empty throne.    \"Good!\" said the big Loon who had commanded the party. \"Now to get King  Bal to judge these terrible creatures we have so bravely captured.\"    As he spoke he took hold of the string and began to pull as hard as he  could. One or two of the others helped him and pretty soon, as they  drew in the cord, the leaves above them parted and a Loon appeared at  the other end of the string. It didn't take long to draw him down to  the throne, where he seated himself and was tied in, so he wouldn't  float upward again.    \"Hello,\" said the King, blinking his purple eyes at his followers;  \"what's up now!\"    \"Strangers, your Majesty--strangers and captives,\" replied the big  Loon, pompously.    \"Dear me!  I see 'em. I see 'em very plainly,\" exclaimed the King, his  purple eyes bulging out as he looked at the three prisoners. \"What  curious animals! Are they dangerous, do you think, my good Panta?\"    \"I'm 'fraid so, your Majesty. Of course, they may not be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/961"],[0,"Glinda of Oz (#4)"],[1,"up even then, so he could reach with his claws  strand after strand of the filmy purple web, which he was able to sever  with one nip.    When enough of the web had been cut to allow them to pass, Dorothy ran  back to the pool and placed the white crab in the water, after which  she rejoined Ozma. They were just in time to escape through the web,  for several of the purple spiders now appeared, having discovered that  their web had been cut, and had the girls not rushed through the  opening the spiders would have quickly repaired the cuts and again  imprisoned them.    Ozma and Dorothy ran as fast as they could and although the angry  spiders threw a number of strands of web after them, hoping to lasso  them or entangle them in the coils, they managed to escape and clamber  to the top of the hill.          Chapter Three    The Mist Maidens      From the top of the hill Ozma and Dorothy looked down into the valley  beyond and were surprised to find it filled with a floating mist that  was as dense as smoke. Nothing in the valley was visible except these  rolling waves of mist, but beyond, on the other side, rose a grassy  hill that appeared quite beautiful.    \"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"what are we to do, Ozma? Walk down into that  thick fog, an' prob'bly get lost in it, or wait till it clears away?\"    \"I'm not sure it will clear away, however long we wait,\" replied Ozma,  doubtfully. \"If we wish to get on, I think we must venture into the  mist.\"    \"But we can't see where we're going, or what we're stepping on,\"  protested Dorothy.  \"There may be dreadful things mixed up in that fog,  an' I'm scared just to think of wading into it.\"    Even Ozma seemed to hesitate. She was silent and thoughtful for a  little while, looking at the rolling drifts that were so gray and  forbidding. Finally she said:    \"I believe this is a Mist Valley, where these moist clouds always  remain, for even the sunshine above does not drive them away. Therefore  the Mist Maids must live here, and they are fairies and should answer  my call.\"    She placed her two hands before her mouth, forming a hollow with them,  and uttered a clear, thrilling, bird-like cry. It floated far out over  the mist waves and presently was answered by a similar sound, as of a  far-off echo.    Dorothy was much impressed. She had seen many strange things since  coming to this fairy country, but here was a new experience. At  ordinary times Ozma was just like any little girl one might chance to  meet--simple, merry, lovable as could be--yet with a certain reserve  that lent her dignity in her most joyous moods. There were times,  however, when seated on her throne and commanding her subjects, or when  her fairy powers were called into use, when Dorothy and all others  about her stood in awe of their lovely girl Ruler and realized her  superiority.    Ozma waited. Presently out from the billows rose beautiful forms,  clothed in fleecy, trailing garments of gray that could scarcely be  distinguished from the mist. Their hair was mist-color, too; only their  gleaming arms and sweet, pallid faces proved they were living,  intelligent creatures answering the call of a sister fairy.    Like sea nymphs they rested on the bosom of the clouds, their eyes  turned questioningly upon the two girls who stood upon the bank. One  came quite near and to her Ozma said:    \"Will you please take us to the opposite hillside? We are afraid to  venture into the mist. I am Princess Ozma of Oz, and this is my friend  Dorothy, a Princess of Oz.\"    The Mist Maids came nearer, holding out their arms. Without hesitation  Ozma advanced and allowed them to embrace her and Dorothy plucked up  courage to follow. Very gently the Mist Maids held them. Dorothy  thought the arms were cold and misty--they didn't seem real at all--yet  they supported the two girls above the surface of the billows and  floated with them so swiftly to the green hillside opposite that the  girls were astonished to find themselves set upon the grass before they  realized they had fairly started.    \"Thank you!\" said Ozma gratefully, and Dorothy also added her thanks  for the service.    The Mist Maids made no answer, but they smiled and waved their hands in  good-bye as again they floated out into the mist and disappeared from  view.          Chapter Four    The Magic Tent      \"Well,\" said Dorothy with a laugh, \"that was easier than I expected.  It's worth while, sometimes, to be a real fairy. But I wouldn't like to  be that kind, and live in a dreadful fog all the time.\"    They now climbed the bank and found before them a delightful plain that  spread for miles in all directions. Fragrant wild flowers were  scattered throughout the grass; there were bushes bearing lovely  blossoms and luscious fruits; now and then a group of stately trees  added to the beauty of the landscape. But there were no dwellings or  signs of life.    The farther side of the plain was bordered by a row of palms, and just  in front of the palms rose a queerly shaped hill that towered above the  plain like a mountain. The sides of this hill were straight up and  down; it was oblong in shape and the top seemed flat and level.    \"Oh, ho!\" cried Dorothy; \"I'll bet that's the mountain Glinda told us  of, where the Flatheads live.\"    \"If it is,\" replied Ozma, \"the Lake of the Skeezers must be just beyond  the line of palm trees. Can you walk that far, Dorothy?\"    \"Of course, in time,\" was the prompt answer. \"I'm sorry we had to leave  the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon behind us, for they'd come in handy just  now; but with the end of our journey in sight a tramp across these  pretty green fields won't tire us a bit.\"    It was a longer tramp than they suspected, however, and night overtook  them before they could reach the flat mountain. So Ozma proposed they  camp for the night and Dorothy was quite ready to approve. She didn't  like to admit to her friend she was tired, but she told herself that  her legs \"had prickers in 'em,\" meaning they had begun to ache.    Usually when Dorothy started on a journey of exploration or adventure,  she carried with her a basket of food, and other things that a traveler  in a strange country might require, but to go away with Ozma was quite  a different thing, as experience had taught her. The fairy Ruler of Oz  only needed her silver wand--tipped at one end with a great sparkling  emerald--to provide through its magic all that they might need.  Therefore Ozma, having halted with her companion and selected a smooth,  grassy spot on the plain, waved her wand in graceful curves and chanted  some mystic words in her sweet voice, and in an instant a handsome tent  appeared before them. The canvas was striped purple and white, and from  the center pole fluttered the royal banner of Oz.    \"Come, dear,\" said Ozma, taking Dorothy's hand, \"I am hungry and I'm  sure you must be also; so let us go in and have our feast.\"    On entering the tent they found a table set for two, with snowy linen,  bright silver and sparkling glassware, a vase of roses in the center  and many dishes of delicious food, some smoking hot, waiting to satisfy  their hunger. Also, on either side of the tent were beds, with satin  sheets, warm blankets and pillows filled with swansdown. There were  chairs, too, and tall lamps that lighted the interior of the tent with  a soft, rosy glow.    Dorothy, resting herself at her fairy friend's command, and eating her  dinner with unusual enjoyment, thought of the wonders of magic. If one  were a fairy and knew the secret laws of nature and the mystic words  and ceremonies that commanded those laws, then a simple wave of a  silver wand would produce instantly all that men work hard and  anxiously for through weary years. And Dorothy wished in her kindly,  innocent heart, that all men and women could be fairies with silver  wands, and satisfy all their needs without so much work and worry, for  then, she imagined, they would have all their working hours to be happy  in. But Ozma, looking into her friend's face and reading those  thoughts, gave a laugh and said:    \"No, no, Dorothy, that wouldn't do at all. Instead of happiness your  plan would bring weariness to the world. If every one could wave a wand  and have his wants fulfilled there would be little to wish for. There  would be no eager striving to obtain the difficult, for nothing would  then be difficult, and the pleasure of earning something longed for,  and only to be secured by hard work and careful thought, would be  utterly lost. There would be nothing to do you see, and no interest in  life and in our fellow creatures. That is all that makes life worth our  while--to do good deeds and to help those less fortunate than  ourselves.\"    \"Well, you're a fairy, Ozma. Aren't you happy?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Yes, dear, because I can use my fairy powers to make others happy. Had  I no kingdom to rule, and no subjects to look after, I would be  miserable. Also, you must realize that while I am a more powerful fairy  than any other inhabitant of Oz, I am not as powerful as Glinda the  Sorceress, who has studied many arts of magic that I know nothing of.  Even the little Wizard of Oz can do some things I am unable to  accomplish, while I can accomplish things unknown to the Wizard. This  is to explain that I'm not all-powerful, by any means. My magic is  simply fairy magic, and not sorcery or wizardry.\"    \"All the same,\" said Dorothy, \"I'm mighty glad you could make this tent  appear, with our dinners and beds all ready for us.\"    Ozma smiled.    \"Yes, it is indeed wonderful,\" she agreed. \"Not all fairies know that  sort of magic, but some fairies can do magic that fills me with  astonishment. I think that is what makes us modest and unassuming--the  fact that our magic arts are divided, some being given each of us. I'm  glad I don't know everything, Dorothy, and that there still are things  in both nature and in wit for me to marvel at.\"    Dorothy"]]]
