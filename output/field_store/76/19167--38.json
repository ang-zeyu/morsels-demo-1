When we came on shore, we were  immediately surrounded by natives, who surveyed us with great curiosity and  attention. We had prepared ourselves with fowling-pieces and shooting  equipage, with the view of penetrating into the interior country: in  pursuance of our design, we dispatched a messenger to _Decar_, with a  request that we might be supplied with attendants and horses: our  solicitation was promptly complied with; and Alexander, Marraboo's son,  speedily made his appearance with two horses, attended by several chiefs  and head men. Our cavalcade made a most grotesque exhibition; Mr. Hamilton  and myself being on horseback, followed by Alexander and his attendants on  foot, in their native accoutrements and shooting apparatus. My seat was not  the most easy, neither was my horse very correct in his paces; the saddle  being scarcely long enough to admit me, with a projection behind, intended  as a security from falling backwards: the stirrups were formed of a thin  plate of iron, about three or four inches broad, and so small, that I could  scarcely squeeze my feet into them. In our progress we killed several  birds, of a species unknown in Europe, and of a most beautiful plumage; one  of which, a little larger than the partridge in England, was armed with a  sharp dart or weapon projecting from the pinion, as if designed by nature  to operate as a guard against its enemies. Our associates rendered us every  friendly attention, and evinced great anxiety to contribute to our sport;  and proved themselves skilful and expert marksmen. The country abounded  with a multiplicity of trees and plants, which would no doubt have amply  rewarded the researches of the botanist, and scientific investigator. The  fatigue I had undergone, and the oppressive heat of the sun, so completely  overpowered me, by the time of our return to Goree Town, that I felt myself  attacked by a violent fever; in this situation I was attended with every  tenderness and solicitude by the females; some bringing me a calabash of  milk, others spreading me a mat to repose upon, and all uniting in kind  offices: it is from them alone that man derives his highest happiness in  this life; and in all situations to which he is exposed, they are the  assuasive agents by whom his sorrows are soothed, his sufferings  alleviated, and his griefs subdued; while compassion is their prominent  characteristic, and sympathy a leading principle of their minds.    The attention of these kind beings, and the affectionate offices of my  friend, operating upon a naturally good constitution, soon enabled me to  overcome the disease, and to return again to Goree. During the remaining  part of my stay there, I was vigilantly employed in procuring every  information relative to this part of the coast, and through the  intelligence of several of the native inhabitants and traders, I am enabled  to submit the following remarks.    To elucidate, with perspicuity, the deep impression I feel of the  importance of this district of the Windward Coast, in obtaining a facility  of intercourse with the interior, combining such a variety of local  advantage, by which our ascendency may be preserved, and our commercial  relations improved, is an undertaking, the difficulties of which I duly  appreciate; and I am aware that I have to combat many prejudices and  grounds of opposition to the system I conceive to be practicable, to  develope the various stores of wealth with which Africa abounds, and to  improve the intellectual faculties of its native inhabitants.    That a situation so highly valuable as the Senegal, and its contiguous  auxiliary, the island of Goree, has been so overlooked, is certainly a  subject of great surprise, and deep regret. While visionary and  impracticable efforts have been resorted to penetrate into the interior of  Africa, we have strangely neglected the maritime situations, which abound  with multifarious objects of commerce, and valuable productions, inviting  our interference to extricate them from their dormant state; and the  consideration apparently has been overlooked, that the barbarism of the  natives on the frontiers must first be subdued by enlightened example,  before the path of research can be opened to the interior.    We have several recent occurrences to lament, where the most enterprising  efforts have failed, through the inherent jealousies of the natives, and  their ferocious character; and, therefore, it is expedient to commence  experiments in the maritime countries, as the most eligible points from  whence operative influence is to make its progress, civilization display  itself among the inhabitants, and a facility of intercourse be attained  with the interior. So long as this powerful barrier remains in its present  condition, it will continue unexplored; and our intercourse with its more  improved tribes must remain obscured, by the forcible opposition of the  frontier; and these immense regions, with their abundant natural resources,  continue unknown to the civilized world. The inhabitants of the sea coast  are always more fierce and savage than those more remote and insular: all  travellers and voyagers, who have visited mankind in their barbarous state,  must substantiate this fact: and the history of nations and states clearly  demonstrates, that the never-failing influence of commerce and agriculture  united, has emanated from the frontiers, and progressively spread their  blessings into the interior countries. View our own now envied greatness,  and the condition in which our forefathers lived, absorbed in idolatry and  ignorance, and it will unquestionably appear, that our exalted state of  being has arisen from the introduction of the civilized arts of life, the  commerce which our local situation has invited to our shores, and our  agricultural industry.    Within the district now in contemplation, flows the river of _Senegal_,  with its valuable _gum trade_; the _Gambia_, abounding with innumerable  objects of commerce, such as indigo, and a great variety of plants for  staining, of peculiar properties, timber, wax, ivory, &c.; _the Rio Grande,  Rio Noonez, Rio Pongo,_ &c. all greatly productive, and their borders  inhabited by the Jolliffs, the Foollahs, the Susees, the Mandingos, and  other inferior nations, and communicating, as is now generally believed,  with the river Niger, which introduces us to the interior of this great  continent; the whole presenting an animating prospect to the distinguished  enterprise of our country.    That these advantages should be neglected, is, as I have before said,  subject of deep regret, and are the objects which I would entreat my  countrymen to contemplate, as the most eligible to attain a knowledge of  this important quarter of the globe, and to introduce civilization among  its numerous inhabitants; by which means, our enemies will be excluded from  that emolument and acquirement, which we supinely overlook and abandon to  contingencies.    The island of Goree lies between the French settlement of the Senegal and  the river Gambia, and therefore is a very appropriate local station to aid  in forming a general system of operation from Cape Verd to Cape Palmas,  subject to one administration and control. The administrative authority, I  would recommend to be established in the river of Sierra Leone, as a  central situation, from whence evolution is to proceed with requisite  facility, and a ready intercourse be maintained throughout the whole of the  Windward Coast; and as intermediate situations, I would propose the rivers  Gambia, Rio Noonez, Rio Pongo, and Isles de Loss, to the northward; and to  the southward, the Bannana Islands, the Galinhas, Bassau, John's River, &c.  to Cape Palmas; or such of them as would be found, upon investigation, best  calculated to promote the resources of this extensive coast.    The supreme jurisdiction in the river Sierra Leone, with auxiliaries  established to influence the trade of the foregoing rivers, form the  outlines of my plan, to be supported by an adequate military force, and  organized upon principles which I have hereafter to explain in the course  of my narrative.    Having an opportunity to sail for England, in his Majesty's sloop of war  the Eugenie, commanded by Charles Webb, Esq. as it was uncertain at what  time the Lark was to proceed, I availed myself of that officer's kind  permission to embark, accompanied by surgeon Thomas Burrowes and his lady.    The Eugenie had been dispatched for England to convoy the Crescent  transport brig, with Mr. Mungo Park on board, to the river Gambia, upon his  late mission to the interior of Africa. Captain Webb did not conceive it  prudent, nor indeed was it expedient, to proceed higher up the river than  Jillifree, and dispatched the Crescent as far as Kaya, about 150 miles from  the capes of the river, where Mr. Park landed with his associates, viz. his  surgeon, botanist, draftsman, and about 40 soldiers, commanded by an  officer obtained from the royal African corps at Goree, by the order of  Government.    Nothing could have been more injudicious than attempting this ardoous  undertaking, with any force assuming a military  appearance. The natives of  Africa are extremely jealous of white men, savage and ferocious in their  manners, and in the utmost degree tenacious of any encroachment upon their  country. This unhappy mistake may deprive the world of the researches of  this intelligent and persevering traveller, who certainly merits the esteem  of his country, and who, it is to be feared, may fall a victim to a  misconceived plan, and mistaken procedure.

[Our old friend Tom Cringle (of Blackwood,) occasionally spins or splits  his _Log_ too small. The incidents are weakened in the drawing out,  or exaggerated in the telling; but they are sometimes relieved by  brilliant descriptive touches, such as the following, introduced to set  off the fate of one of Tom's heroes at Santiago.]    _The Butterfly, Chameleon, and Serpent._    Glancing bright in the sunshine, a most beautiful butterfly fluttered in  the air, in the very middle of the open window. When we first saw it, it  was flitting gaily and happily amongst the plants and flowers that were  blooming in the balcony, but it gradually became more and more slow on  the wing, and at last poised itself unusually steadily for an insect of  its class. Below it, on the window sill, near the wall, with head erect,  and its little basilisk eyes upturned towards the lovely fly, crouched  a chameleon lizard, its beautiful body, when I first looked at it, was  a bright sea-green. It moved into the sunshine, a little away from the  shade of the laurel bush, which grew on the side it first appeared on,  and suddenly the back became transparent amber, the legs and belly  continuing green. From its breast under the chin, it every now and then  shot out a semicircular film of a bright scarlet colour, like a leaf of  a tulip, stretched vertically, or the pectoral fin of a fish.    This was evidently a decoy, and the poor fly was gradually drawn down  towards it, either under the impression of its being in reality a  flower, or impelled by some impulse which it could not resist. It  gradually fluttered nearer and more near, the reptile remaining all the  while steady as a stone, until it made a sudden spring, and in the next  moment the small meally wings were quivering on each side of the  chameleon's tiny jaws. While in the act of gorging its prey, a little  fork, like a wire, was projected from the opposite corner of the window;  presently a small round black snout, with a pair of little, fiery,  blasting eyes, appeared, and a thin, black neck, glancing in the sun.  The lizard saw it. I could fancy it trembled. Its body became of a dark  blue, then ashy pale; the imitation of the flower, the gaudy fin was  withdrawn, it appeared to shrink back as far as it could, but it was  nailed or fascinated to the window sill, for its feet did not move.  The head of the snake approached, with its long, forked tongue shooting  out, and shortening, and with a low hissing noise. By this time about  two feet of its body was visible, lying with its white belly on the  wooden beam, moving forward with a small horizontal wavy motion, the  head and six inches of the neck being a little raised. I shrunk back  from the serpent, but no one else seemed to have any dread of it;  indeed, I afterwards learned, that this kind being good mousers, and  otherwise quite harmless, were, if any thing, encouraged about houses in  the country. I looked again; its open mouth was now within an inch of  the lizard, which by this time seemed utterly paralyzed and motionless;  the next instant its head was drawn into the snake's mouth, and  gradually the whole body disappeared, as the reptile gorged it, and  I could perceive from the lump which gradually moved down the snake's  neck, that it had been sucked into its stomach. Involuntary I raised  my hand, when the whole suddenly disappeared.    [One of Tom's _land-storms_ is still more graphic.]    A heavy cloud that had been overhanging the small valley the whole  morning, had by this time spread out and covered the entire face of  nature like a sable pall; the birds of the air flew low, and seemed to  be perfectly gorged with the superabundance of flies, which were thickly  betaking themselves for shelter under the evergreen leaves of the  bushes. All the winged creation, great and small, were fast betaking  themselves to the shelter of the leaves and branches of the trees. The  cattle were speeding to the hollows under the impending rocks; negroes,  men, women, and children, were hurrying with their hoes on their  shoulders past the windows to their huts. Several large bloodhounds had  ventured into the hall, and were crouching with a low whine at our feet.  The large carrion crows were the only living things which seemed to  brave the approaching _chu-basco_, and were soaring high up in the  heavens, appearing to touch the black, agitated fringe of the lowering  thunder clouds. All other kinds of winged creatures, parrots, and  pigeons, and cranes, had vanished by this time under the thickest trees,  and into the deepest coverts, and the wild ducks were shooting past in  long lines, piercing the thick air with outstretched neck and clanging  wing.    Suddenly the wind fell, and the sound of the waterfall increased, and  grew rough and loud, and the undefinable rushing noise that precedes a  heavy fall of rain in the tropics, the voice of the wilderness, moaned  through the high woods, until at length the clouds sank upon the valley  in boiling mists, rolling halfway down the surrounding hills; and the  water of the stream, whose scanty rill but an instant before hissed over  the precipice in a small, transparent ribbon of clear grass-green,  sprinkled with white foam, and then threaded its way round the large  rocks in its capacious channel, like a silver eel twisting through a  desert, now changed in a moment to a dark turgid chocolate colour; and  even as we stood and looked, lo! a column of water from the mountains,  pitched in thunder over the face of the precipice, making the earth  tremble, and driving up from the rugged face of the everlasting rocks in  smoke, and forcing the air into eddies and sudden blasts which tossed  the branches of the trees that overhung it, as they were dimly seen  through clouds of drizzle, as if they had been shaken by a tempest,  although there was not a breath stirring elsewhere out of heaven; while  little, wavering, spiral wreaths of mist rose up thick from the surface  of the boiling pool at the bottom of the cataract, like miniature  water-spouts, until they were dispersed by the agitation of the air  above.    At length the swollen torrent rolled roaring down the narrow valley,  filling the whole water-course, about fifty yards wide, and advancing  with a solid front a fathom _high_--a fathom _deep_ does not  convey the idea--like a stream of lava, or as one may conceive of the  Red Sea, when, at the stretching forth of the hand of the prophet of the  Lord, its mighty waters rolled back and stood heaped up as a wall to the  host of Israel.    The channel of the stream, which but a minute before I could have leaped  across, was the next instant filled and utterly impassable.    And the rain now began pattering in large drops, like scattering shots  preceding an engagement, on the wooden shingles with which the house was  roofed, gradually increasing to a loud rushing noise, which, as the  rooms were not ceiled, prevented a word being heard.    At length the weather cleared, and the shutters having been opened, and  with a suddenness which no one can comprehend who has not lived in these  climates, the sun now shone brightly on the flowers and garden plants  which grew in a range of pots on the balcony.           *       *       *       *       *      THE DUCHESSE DE BERRI.    (_From the New Monthly Magazine_.)      We have much pleasure in inserting these very curious anecdotes of an  unfortunate Princess, though they come to us from one devoted to her  cause, as well as sympathizing with her misfortunes.    Few heroines of ancient days have displayed more courage, self-devotion,  and firmness, than has this high-souled and heroic woman. It is not  generally known in this country, that in an action in La Vendee, where  the partizans of the Duchess were opposed to the regular troops, she  headed her forces, and led the charges repeatedly. She had a horse shot  dead under her, and having been disarmed in the fall, seized the arms of  a fallen soldier next her, and again cheered on her followers. She was  eleven hours in action, and escaped unhurt, with the exception of some  contusions from the fall; and, when the battle was over, was seen  administering to the wants of those around her, dressing their wounds  with her own delicate hands; and whilst surrounded by the dead and  dying, she appeared wholly regardless of self, though overcome by a  fatigue and anxiety that few, even of the other sex, could have borne  so well.    On another occasion, the Duchesse de Berri had, with much difficulty,  procured a horse, and was mounted behind a faithful but humble adherent,  pursuing her route to a distant quarter, when her guide was accosted by  a peasant with whom he conversed some time in the patois of the country.  On quitting the peasant, he observed to the Duchess, that the man was  charged with a secret mission to a place at some distance, and was so  fatigued that he feared he could not reach it. She instantly sprang from  her seat, called after the peasant, and insisted on his taking the  horse, declaring that she could reach her destination on foot. After  walking for many hours, she arrived at a mountain stream that was  swollen by the recent rain, and having learned that her enemies were in  pursuit of her, she determined to cross it. Her guide, assisted by her,  fastened a large branch of a tree to his person, and, being an expert  swimmer, told her to hold by it, and that he hoped to get her over. They "]]]
