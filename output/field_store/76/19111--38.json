On  entering the park, I was first struck with a long row of boxes,  (somewhat in the style of those at Vauxhall) but on a raised bank, and  attached to a _restaurateur_. Here were tables for dinner, and as many  others were laid in the open air--with the usual _carte_ of 2 or 300  articles, and the economical elegancies of silver, napkins, and china,  and this, too, in style little inferior to Verey's in the Palais Royal.  Promenaders of the better description appeared in the mall, or principal  walk, and it being the last fete of the season, their attendance was  very numerous. The stalls and exhibitions were chiefly on the left side  of this walk; at the former was displayed an almost indescribable  variety of wares, which were the adjudged prizes in a lottery; but, from  the decisions which I witnessed, they resembled the _stationary_  capitals in an English scheme--the nominal Stock in trade of the  office-keepers. Many of these little gambling shops were superintended  by women, who proved themselves far from deficient in loquacious  inducements for adventurers; and by their dexterous settlement of the  chances, left little time for losers to reflect on their folly.  Provisions of various descriptions were to be purchased at every turn,  and among their _marchands_, it was not incurious, to see some humble  professors of gastronomy over smoking viands, fritters, and goffers or  indented wafers baked on cast-iron stoves _a la minute_--it must be  owned, unseasonable luxuries for a September day. The _spectacles_, or  shows, in noise and absurdity, exceeded the English trumpery of that  order; and to judge from the gaping crowds which they attracted, we are  not the only credulous nation in the world. Among the games was a  machine resembling an English round-a-bout, with wooden horses for the  players, each of whom was furnished with a foil, with which he strove to  seize the greatest number of rings from the centre; this was, indeed, a  chivalrous exhibition. Stilt-walkers, mountebank families, and jugglers,  \"chequered in bulk and brains,\" lent their aid to amuse the crowd; and,  occasionally, two or three fellows contrived to enact scenes from plays,  and with their vulgar wit to merit the applause of their audience.  Portable clock-work exhibitions swarmed, and mummeries or mysteries,  representing the Life and Death of our Saviour and the blessed Virgin,  appeared to be ritual accompaniments of the day, and represented each  stage of the holy lives. The bearers of the latter machinery enlivened  their exhibitions with a grinding organ, which they accompanied with  appropriate ditties or carols. Crosses and other religious emblems were  hung about the theatrical boxes or shows, which, with their  representations, could only be compared with the nursery toys of Noah's  ark, with which most of us have been amused. Accordingly, here were  models of Nazareth, Jerusalem, and Mount Calvary, in the characteristic  accuracy of biblical topography, and from the zeal of the spectators,  the ingenuity of the inventors was unsparingly rewarded.    I turned from these sights to the natural beauties of the park, which,  aided by the happy inequalities of the ground, (which French artists  imagined would be such an obstacle to its perfection,) possesses far  more variety than is usually found in the pleasure-grounds of France.  The original plantation of the park was the work of La Notre, who, it  will be recollected, planned the garden of Versailles; but St. Cloud is  considered his _chef-d'oeuvre_, and proves, that with the few natural  advantages which it afforded him, he was enabled to effect more here  than millions have accomplished at Versailles--where art is fairly  overmatched with her own wasteful and ridiculous excess. This alone  ought to make the French blush for that monument of royal folly.    The situation of the chateau is its greatest attraction. It possesses a  fine view of Paris, which is indeed a splendid item in the prospect of  the princely occupants; and the sight of the capital may, perhaps, be a  pleasant relief to the natural seclusion of the palace.    One of the most remarkable objects in the park is a kind of square  tower, surmounted with an exact copy, in _terra cotta_, of the lantern  of Diogenes at Athens, ornamented with six Corinthian columns. It is  used as an observatory, and, like its original, is associated with the  name of the illustrious Grecian--it being also called the lantern of  Diogenes. Its view of the subjacent plain overlooks the city of Paris by  a distance of twenty miles.    The fountains and _jets d'eau_ are entitled to special notice, although  in extent and variety they are far exceeded by those of Versailles. The  arrangement of the principal cascade is well contrived, and I had the  good fortune to be present at the moment the water commenced flowing,  which continued but a short time. This struck me as a singular piece of  mimicry, and compared with those truly-sublime spectacles--the cascades  of Nature--the boasted works of St. Cloud seemed mere playthings, like  the little falls which children contrive in running brooks; or at best  resembling hydraulic exhibitions on an extensive scale. The playing  commenced by a jet bursting from a point almost secluded by trees, which  appeared on a level with the first story of the palace; the stream then  fell into stone basins, and by turns threw itself aloft, or gushed from  the mouths of numberless marine animals, and descended by glassy falls  into a basin, whence it found its way into several vase-shaped forms,  and again descended by magnificent cascades, discharging themselves into  a large, circular tank or basin, with two strong jets throwing their  limpid streams many feet high. In the sculptured forms there is some  display of classic design; and the effect of many mouths and forms  gushing forth almost instantaneously was altogether that of magic art,  not unaided by the lines of trees on two sides being clipped or cut into  semi-arched forms. The most powerful of the fountains is, however, a  grand jet, characteristically named the _Geant_, or giant, for the  incredible force with which it springs from its basin, and rises 125  feet high, being more than the elevation of Napoleon's triumphal column,  in the Place Vendome, at Paris. An uninterrupted view of these  exhibitions may be enjoyed from the river, which runs parallel with the  road adjoining the park. Crowds flocked from all directions to witness  the first gush of the fountains; but their attention soon became  directed to a royal party attended by footmen, from the palace, who came  to witness the sights of the fair, and appeared especially amused with a  family of vaulters and stilt-walkers. They were received with a slight  buzz of curiosity, but without that enthusiasm with which the English  are accustomed to recognise, and, not unfrequently, to annoy royalty;  for here      No man cried, God save them.    I now began to make a more minute survey of the preparations for  amusement, for the fete was not yet in its equinoctial splendour. The  most prominent of these were plots of the raised bank on one side, and  at the termination of the principal walk, which were enclosed with  hurdles or frames, a platform being elevated and decorated with  festooned curtains, &c. for an orchestra, and the whole hung round with  illumination lamps. Towards evening, but long before dark, these  enclosures were blazing with variegated splendour; the bands commenced  playing several lively French airs, and the area was occupied with  groups of waltzing and quadrilling votaries. As the evening darkened,  lamps began to glisten in every direction, and the well-lighted cafes  resembled so many Chinese lanterns; and these, aided by the discordant  sounds of scores of instruments, gave the whole scene an air of  enchantment, or rather a slight resemblance to one of its exorcisms. The  effect was, however, improved by distance. Accordingly, I stole through  a solitary shrubbery walk, which wound round the hill, and at length led  me to a forest-like spot, or straggling wood, which flanked the whole of  the carnival. Viewed from hence, it was, indeed, a fantastical  illustration of French gaiety, and it momentarily reminded me of some of  Shakspeare's scenes of sylvan romance, with all their fays and fairy  population.    The English reader who has not witnessed one of the fetes of St. Cloud,  may probably associate them with his own Vauxhall; but the resemblance  is very slight. At one of these entertainments in France, there is much  less attempted, but considerably more effected, than in England; and all  this is accomplished by that happy knack which the French possess of  making much of a little. Of what did this fete consist--a few hundred  lamps--a few score of fidlers, and about as much decoration as an  English showman would waste on the exterior of his exhibition, or  assemble within a few square yards. There were no long illuminated  vistas, or temples and saloons red hot with oil and gas--but a few  slender materials, so scattered and intermixed with the natural beauties  of the park, as to fascinate, and not fatigue the eye and ear. Even the  pell-mell frolics of St. Cloud were better idealities of enjoyment, than  the splendid promenade of Vauxhall, in the days of its olden celebrity;  for diamonds and feathers are often mere masquerade finery in such  scenes--so distant are the heads and hearts of their wearers.[6]        [6] We are not permitted to allude to the fete of St. Cloud as a      scene of _pastoral_ amusement, or of the primitive simplicity      which is associated with that epithet. The French are not a      pastoral people, although they are not less so than the English;      neither are the suburbs of a metropolis rural life. They are too      near the pride of human art for pastoral pleasures, and no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11401"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Under this management, these birds fattened to the great profit of their  proprietors, who sold them to Roman epicures for three _denarii_, or  about two shillings each of our money.    Towards the end of September the leaves of trees begin to put on their  autumnal dress. Mr. Stillingfleet remarks, that, about the 25th, the  leaves of the plane tree were tawny; of the hazel, yellow; of the oak,  yellowish green; of the sycamore, dirty brown; of the maple, pale  yellow; of the ash, a fine lemon-colour; of the elm, orange; of the  hawthorn, tawny yellow; of the cherry, red; of the horn-beam, bright  yellow; of the willow, still hoary. Yet, many of these tints cannot be  considered complete, in some seasons, till the middle or latter end of  October.    When the harvest is gathered in, the husbandman prepares for seed-time;  and the fields are again ploughed up for the winter corn, rye, and  wheat, which are sown in September and October. The entrances to  bee-hives are straightened, to prevent the access of wasps and other  pilferers.           *       *       *       *       *      ASTRONOMICAL OCCURRENCES    _FOR SEPTEMBER, 1827_.    (_For the Mirror_.)      The sun enters the cardinal and equinoctial sign _Libra_, on the 23rd at  8 h. 24 min. evening, once more bringing our day and night to an equal  length; when 8 deg. of _Gemini_ are due east, and 4 deg. of _Aquarius_  due south, all the planets having a direct motion, and being below the  horizon, Herschel excepted. The astrological aspects at this ingress are  as follow:--Saturn is located in the third house; Mercury, Venus, and  Mars in the fifth, the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter are in the sixth, while  Herschel occupies the ninth.    Mercury is in conjunction with Mars on the 4th, at 1 h. morning; on the  6th with the fixed star, Regulus, or Corheoni; with Venus on the 18th,  at midnight; and in superior conjunction with the Sun on the 24th, at  9-1/2 h. evening.    Venus rises at the beginning of the month about 4-1/2 h. morning, and  towards the end at 5-1/2 h.    Mars rises through the month at 31/2 h. morning.    Jupiter is now gradually receding from our view, and will ere long be  totally surrounded with the brighter beams of the Sun; his eclipses are  therefore not visible.    Saturn is apparently now fast approaching this part of our hemisphere;  he rises on the 1st at 12-1/2 h. and on the 31st at 10-3/4 h. evening.    Herschel culminates on the 1st at 9h. 6m. and on the 31st at 7h. 12m.    If the reader will refer to page 131 of the 8th vol. of the MIRROR,  he will find his attention invited to the relative positions of the  principal northern stars and constellations for September last year:  their present appearance is precisely similar. Pasche.           *       *       *       *       *          SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS           *       *       *       *       *      \"THE WOODSMAN.\"      A German newspaper contains a strange account--avouched with as much  apparent accuracy almost as those which concerned the mermaids lately  seen off our own coast, or the sea-serpent that visits the shores of  America--of a conversion lately worked upon the morals of a famous  robber, by a supernatural visitation in the forest of Wildeshausen. The  hero of the tale, whose name is Conrad Braunsvelt, but who was better  known by the cognomen of \"The Woodsman,\" was drinking one evening  at a small inn on the borders of the forest of Wildeshausen, when a  traveller, well mounted, and carrying a portmanteau on his horse behind  him, came up by the road which runs from the direction of Hanover. The  stranger, after inquiring if he could be accommodated with a bed, led  his horse away to the stable, and in doing this, left his portmanteau  upon a bench within the house--which Conrad immediately, as a  preliminary measure, tried the weight of. He had just discovered that  the valise was unusually heavy, when the return of the traveller  compelled him to desist; but his curiosity, without any farther effort,  was not long ungratified; for the stranger soon opened it before him, as  it seemed, to take out some articles which were necessary for his use at  night; and displayed in the process several large bags--larger almost  than the machine would have seemed able to contain--which were evidently  full of gold or silver money. The cupidity of Conrad was excited by this  view, and he would gladly have at once secured the prize even at the  hazard of a personal struggle with the stranger; but the people of the  inn (according to his account afterwards) were such as would have  expected a portion of the spoil. For this reason, although unwillingly,  and trusting himself to sleep little, lest by any chance the prey should  escape him, he abandoned his design of robbery, for that night; and on  the next morning, having learned which way the stranger travelled--for  the latter exhibited no suspicions or apprehension of those about him,  but spoke freely of his intended road, though he never mentioned  anything of the charge he carried--having ascertained this fact, he  allowed the rider to depart, and after a short time, followed by a  shorter track through the forest, which was practicable only to persons  on foot, and which would enable him, had he even started later, easily  to overtake the mounted traveller. Now, knowing that his nearer road  saved, as has been noticed, full a league of ground, the \"Woodsman\"  moved on slowly; and accounted that, when he reached the point at which  they were to meet, he should still have some time to wait for the  stranger: on emerging, however, into the high road, he found him to his  surprise _already_ approaching; and, what was still more extraordinary,  mounted upon a _black_ horse, when that on which he had left the inn,  had certainly seemed to be a brown. The portmanteau, however, which was  all that Conrad looked to, was still behind the traveller, and on he  came riding as if nothing at all was the matter: the \"Woodsman\" never  hung back, or staid reflecting, but levelled his rifle, and called upon  him to \"Stand and deliver,\" or his next moment was his last. The  traveller upon this pulled up his horse with an air of great coolness;  and, looking upon Conrad, said something, which, as the robber since  says, he verily believes was--\"That he hoped he had not kept him  _waiting_!\"--or words to that purpose; but he was too busy at the time  to pay much attention to discourse. \"Do you know who it is you are going  to rob though?\" asked the stranger, addressing the \"Woodsman\" directly.  \"Not I,\" replied the latter, boldly: \"but, if you were der Dyvel  himself, descend from that horse, and deliver the bags of money that you  have on you, or you shall die!\" Upon this, the black rider said no more;  but dismounted quietly, although he had pistols in his holsters; and  Conrad, immediately taking the portmanteau from the horse's back, was so  eager to be sure of the contents, that he drew his knife, and cut the  fastenings on the spot. In the meantime, the traveller might have fallen  upon him unawares, and to advantage, but the \"Woodsman\" endeavoured to  keep an eye upon him, while he went on forcing the valise open as well  as he could. At length the straps were all cut, and the robber thrust  his hands in eagerly, making sure to find the bags which he had seen the  preceding evening, for he had distinctly felt them from the outside.  But, when he drew out his hands, there was in one only a _halter_, and  in the other a piece of brass in the shape of a _gibbet_! And, at the  same moment, a gripe was laid upon his arm; and a deep low voice, which  seemed to be close beside him, pronounced the words, \"_This shall be thy  fate_!\" When he turned round in horror and consternation, the horse, and  the rider, and the portmanteau, all were gone; and he found himself  within a few paces of the inn door which he had quitted in the morning,  with the halter and the brass gibbet still remaining in his hand. The  narrative states farther, that this horrible rencontre so affected  Conrad Braunsvelt, that he forthwith delivered himself up to the rangers  of the forest, and was sent to Cassel to await the pleasure of the Grand  Duke. He is now confined in an asylum for repentant criminals, desirous  of being restored to society; and his miraculous warning is noted in the  records of the institution.--_Monthly Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *      CAMBRIAN CONVIVIALITY.        \"Cloth must we wear,    Eat beef, and drink beer,    Though the dead go to bier.\"    _Old Ballad._      There is something refreshing, and not a little inspiriting, in the  scanty relics of those hearty customs and pastimes which imparted such a  manly tone to the character of our ancestors; but now, like the ruined  castle, or the old ivied abbey, they have become objects of admiration  rather than sources of delight. Fifty years ago, the inhabitants of  North Wales, a rude and blunt race even now, were far less sophisticated  by modern refinement than they are at present; and it was then a common  matter for the _Penteulu_, or head of the family, to dine in the large  stone hall of the mansion--he and his own particular friends at a table,  raised on a _Dais_--and his numerous tenants and dependants at another  table running the whole length of the said hall. Then came the  wassailing--worthy of the days of Arthur--wine for the upper table;  ale, medd, (_mead_,) and spirits for the other; and after all came the  friendly contest at some manly game--wrestling, racing, pitching the  bar, or the like. At a period somewhat later, these boisterous pastimes  began to degenerate; and the Welsh squire "]]]
