According to Matignon, so  far as homosexuality exists in China, it is carried on with much more  decorum and restraint than it is in Europe, and he thinks it may be put  down to the credit of the Chinese that, unlike Europeans, they never  practice unnatural connection with women. His account of the customs of  the Chinese confirms Morache's earlier account, and he remarks that,  though not much spoken of, homosexuality is not looked down upon. He gives  some interesting details concerning the boy prostitutes. These are sold by  their parents (sometimes stolen from them), about the age of 4, and  educated, while they are also subjected to a special physical training,  which includes massage of the gluteal regions to favor development,  dilatation of the anus, and epilation (which is not, however, practised by  Chinese women). At the same time, they are taught music, singing, drawing,  and the art of poetry. The waiters at the restaurants always know where  these young gentlemen are to be found when they are required to grace a  rich man's feast. They are generally accompanied by a guardian, and  usually nothing very serious takes place, for they know their value, and  money will not always buy their expensive favors. They are very  effeminate, luxuriously dressed and perfumed, and they seldom go on foot.  There are, however, lower orders of such prostitutes.[26]    Homosexuality is easily traceable in India. Dubois referred to houses  devoted to male prostitution, with men dressed as women, and imitating the  ways of women.[27] Burton in the \"Terminal Essay\" to his translation of  the _Arabian Nights_, states that when in 1845 Sir Charles Napier  conquered and annexed Sind three brothels of eunuchs and boys were found  in the small town of Karachi, and Burton was instructed to visit and  report on them. Hindus, in general, however, it appears, hold  homosexuality in abhorrence. In Afghanistan homosexuality is more  generally accepted, and Burton stated that \"each caravan is accompanied by  a number of boys and lads almost in woman's attire, with kohled eyes and  rouged cheeks, long tresses and hennaed fingers and toes, riding  luxuriously in camel paniers.\"    If we turn to the New World, we find that among the American Indians, from  the Eskimo of Alaska downward to Brazil and still farther south,  homosexual customs have been very frequently observed. Sometimes they are  regarded by the tribe with honor, sometimes with indifference, sometimes  with contempt; but they appear to be always tolerated. Although there are  local differences, these customs, on the whole, seem to have much in  common. The best early description which I have been able to find is by  Langsdorff[28] and concerns the Aleuts of Oonalashka in Alaska: \"Boys, if  they happen to be very handsome,\" he says, \"are often brought up entirely  in the manner of girls, and instructed in the arts women use to please  men; their beards are carefully plucked out as soon as they begin to  appear, and their chins tattooed like those of women; they wear ornaments  of glass beads upon their legs and arms, bind and cut their hair in the  same manner as the women, and supply their place with the men as  concubines. This shocking, unnatural, and immoral practice has obtained  here even from the remotest times; nor have any measures hitherto been  taken to repress and restrain it; such men are known under the name of  _schopans_.\"    Among the Konyagas Langsdorff found the custom much more common than among  the Aleuts; he remarks that, although the mothers brought up some of their  children in this way, they seemed very fond of their offspring. Lisiansky,  at about the same period, tells us that: \"Of all the customs of these  islanders, the most disgusting is that of men, called _schoopans_, living  with men, and supplying the place of women. These are brought up from  their infancy with females, and taught all the feminine arts. They even  assume the manner and dress of the women so nearly that a stranger would  naturally take them for what they are not. This odious practice was  formerly so prevalent that the residence of one of these monsters in a  house was considered as fortunate; it is, however, daily losing  ground.\"[29] He mentions a case in which a priest had nearly married two  males, when an interpreter chanced to come in and was able to inform him  what he was doing.    The practice has, however, apparently continued to be fairly common among  the Alaska Eskimos down to recent times. Thus Dr. Engelmann mentioned to  me that he was informed by those who had lived in Alaska, especially near  Point Barrow, that as many as 5 such individuals (regarded by uninstructed  strangers as \"hermaphrodites\") might be found in a single comparatively  small community. It is stated by Davydoff, as quoted by Holmberg,[30] that  the boy is selected to be a _schopan_ because he is girl-like. This is a  point of some interest as it indicates that the schopan is not effeminated  solely by suggestion and association, but is probably feminine by inborn  constitution.    In Louisiana, Florida, Yucatan, etc., somewhat similar customs exist or  have existed. In Brazil men are to be found dressed as women and solely  occupying themselves with feminine occupations; they are not very highly  regarded.[31] They are called _cudinas_: i.e., circumcized. Among the  Pueblo Indians of New Mexico these individuals are called _mujerados_  (supposed to be a corruption of _mujeriego_) and are the chief passive  agents in the homosexual ceremonies of these people. They are said to be  intentionally effeminated in early life by much masturbation and by  constant horse-riding.[32]    Among all the tribes of the northwest United States sexual inverts may be  found. The invert is called a _bote_ (\"not man, not woman\") by the  Montana, and a _burdash_ (\"half-man, half-woman\") by the Washington  Indians. The _bote_ has been carefully studied by Dr. A.B. Holder.[33]  Holder finds that the _bote_ wears woman's dress, and that his speech and  manners are feminine. The dress and manners are assumed in childhood, but  no sexual practices take place until puberty. These consist in the  practice of _fellatio_ by the _bote_, who probably himself experiences the  orgasm at the same time. The _bote_ is not a pederast, although pederasty  occurs among these Indians. Holder examined _bote_ who was splendidly  made, prepossessing, and in perfect health. With much reluctance he agreed  to a careful examination. The sexual organs were quite normal, though  perhaps not quite so large as his _physique_ would suggest, but he had  never had intercourse with a woman. On removing his clothes he pressed his  thighs together, as a timid woman would, so as to conceal completely the  sexual organs; Holder says that the thighs \"really, or to my fancy,\" had  the feminine rotundity. He has heard a _bote_ \"_beg_ a male Indian to  submit to his caress,\" and he tells that \"one little fellow, while in the  agency boarding-school, was found frequently surreptitiously wearing  female attire. He was punished, but finally escaped from school and became  a _bote_, which vocation he has since followed.\"    At Tahiti at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Turnbull[34] found  that \"there are a set of men in this country whose open profession is of  such abomination that the laudable delicacy of our language will not admit  it to be mentioned. These are called by the natives _Mahoos_; they assume  the dress, attitude, and manners of women, and affect all the fantastic  oddities and coquetries of the vainest of females. They mostly associate  with the women, who court their acquaintance. With the manners of the  women they adopt their peculiar employments, making cloth, bonnets, and  mats; and so completely are they unsexed that had they not been pointed  out to me I should not have known them but as women. I add, with some  satisfaction, that the encouragement of this abomination is almost solely  confined to the chiefs.\"    Among the Sakalaves of Madagascar there are certain boys called _sekatra_,  as described by Lasnet, who are apparently chosen from childhood on  account of weak or delicate appearance and brought up as girls. They live  like women and have intercourse with men, with or without sodomy, paying  the men who please them.[35]    Among the negro population of Zanzibar forms of homosexuality which are  believed to be congenital (as well as acquired forms) are said to be  fairly common. Their frequency is thought to be due to Arab influence. The  male congenital inverts show from their earliest years no aptitude for  men's occupations, but are attracted toward female occupations. As they  grow older they wear women's clothes, dress their hair in women's fashion,  and behave altogether like women. They associate only with women and with  male prostitutes, and they obtain sexual satisfaction by passive pederasty  or in ways simulating coitus. In appearance they resemble ordinary male  prostitutes, who are common in Zanzibar, but it is noteworthy that the  natives make a clear distinction between them and men prostitutes. The  latter are looked down on with contempt, while the former, as being what  they are \"by the will of God,\" are tolerated.[36]    Homosexuality; occurs in various parts of Africa. Cases of _effeminatio_  and passive sodomy have been reported from Unyamwezi and Uganda. Among the  Bangala of the Upper Congo sodomy between men is very common, especially  when they are away from home, in strange towns, or in fishing camps. If,  however, a man had intercourse with a woman _per anum_ he was at one time  liable to be put to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#5)"],[1,"since      become quite indifferent, but I am of opinion that the majority      of women who have had prior sexual experience retain desire and      gratification in an equal degree to that they had before      operation. I know one case in which a young girl hardly 19 years      old, who had been accustomed to congress for some twelve months,      had trouble which necessitated the removal of the ovaries and      tubes on both sides. Far from losing all her desire or      gratification, both were very materially increased in intensity.      Menstruation has entirely ceased, without loss of femininity in      either disposition or appearance. During intercourse, I am told,      there is continuous spasmodic contraction of various parts of the      vagina and vulva.\"    The independence of the sexual impulse from the distention of the sexual  glands is further indicated by the great frequency with which sexual  sensations, in a faint or even strong degree, are experienced in childhood  and sometimes in infancy, and by the fact that they often persist in women  long after the sexual glands have ceased their functions.        In the study of auto-erotism in another volume of these _Studies_      I have brought together some of the evidence showing that even in      very young children spontaneous self-induced sexual excitement,      with orgasm, may occur. Indeed, from an early age sexual      differences pervade the whole nervous tissue. I may here quote      the remarks of an experienced gynecologist: \"I venture to think,\"      Braxton Hicks said many years ago, \"that those who have much      attended to children will agree with me in saying that, almost      from the cradle, a difference can be seen in manner, habits of      mind, and in illness, requiring variations in their treatment.      The change is certainly hastened and intensified at the time of      puberty; but there is, even to an average observer, a clear      difference between the sexes from early infancy, gradually      becoming more marked up to puberty. That sexual feelings exist      [it would be better to say 'may exist'] from earliest infancy is      well known, and therefore this function does not depend upon      puberty, though intensified by it. Hence, may we not conclude      that the progress toward development is not so abrupt as has been      generally supposed?... The changes of puberty are all of them      dependent on the primordial force which, gradually gathering in      power, culminates in the perfection both of form and of the      sexual system, primary and secondary.\"        There appear to have been but few systematic observations on the      persistence of the sexual impulse in women after the menopause.      It is regarded as a fairly frequent phenomenon by Kisch, and also      by Loewenfeld (_Sexualleben und Nervenleiden_, p. 29). In America,      Bloom (as quoted in _Medical Standard_, 1896), from an      investigation of four hundred cases, found that in some cases the      sexual impulse persisted to a very advanced age, and mentions a      case of a woman of 70, twenty years past the menopause, who had      been long a widow, but had recently married, and who declared      that both desire and gratification were as great, if not greater,      than before the menopause.    Reference may finally be made to those cases in which the sexual impulse  has developed notwithstanding the absence, verified or probable, of any  sexual glands at all. In such cases sexual desire and sexual gratification  are sometimes even stronger than normal. Colman has reported a case in  which neither ovaries nor uterus could be detected, and the vagina was too  small for coitus, but pleasurable intercourse took place by the rectum and  sexual desire was at times so strong as to amount almost to nymphomania.  Clara Barrus has reported the case of a woman in whom there was congenital  absence of uterus and ovaries, as proved subsequently by autopsy, but the  sexual impulse was very strong and she had had illicit intercourse with a  lover. She suffered from recurrent mania, and then masturbated  shamelessly; when sane she was attractively feminine. Macnaughton-Jones  describes the case of a woman of 32 with normal sexual feelings and fully  developed breasts, clitoris, and labia, but no vagina or internal  genitalia could be detected even under the most thorough examination. In a  case of Bridgman's, again, the womb and ovaries were absent, and the  vagina small, but coitus was not painful, and the voluptuous sensations  were complete and sexual passion was strong. In a case of Cotterill's, the  ovaries and uterus were of minute size and functionless, and the vagina  was absent, but the sexual feelings were normal, and the clitoris  preserved its usual sensibility. Munde had recorded two similar cases, of  which he presents photographs. In all these cases not only was the sexual  impulse present in full degree, but the subjects were feminine in  disposition and of normal womanly conformation; in most cases the external  sexual organs were properly developed.[15]        Fere (_L'Instinct sexuel_, p. 241) has sought to explain away      some of these phenomena, in so far as they may be brought against      the theory that the secretions and excretions of the sexual      glands are the sole source of the sexual impulse. The persistence      of sexual feelings after castration may be due, he argues, to the      presence of the nerves in the cicatrices, just as the amputated      have the illusion that the missing limb is still there. Exactly      the same explanation has since been put forward by Moll,      _Medizinische Klinik_, 1905, Nrs. 12 and 13. In the same way the      presence of sexual feelings after the menopause may be due to      similar irritation determined by degeneration during involution      of the glands. The precocious appearance of the sexual impulse in      childhood he would explain as due to an anomaly of development in      the sexual organs. Fere makes no attempt to explain the presence      of the sexual impulse in the congenital absence of the sexual      glands; here, however, Munde intervenes with the suggestion that      it is possible that in most cases \"an infinitesimal trace of      ovary\" may exist, and preserve femininity, though insufficient to      produce ovulation or menstruation.        It is proper to mention these ingenious arguments. They are,      however, purely hypothetical, obviously invented to support a      theory. It can scarcely be said that they carry conviction. We      may rather agree with Guinard that so great is the importance of      reproduction that nature has multiplied the means by which      preparation is made for the conjunction of the sexes and the      roads by which sexual excitation may arrive. As Hirschfeld puts      it, in a discussion of this subject (_Sexual-Probleme_, Feb.,      1912), \"Nature has several irons in the fire.\"        It will be seen that the conclusions we have reached indirectly      involve the assumption that the spinal nervous centers, through      which the sexual mechanism operates, are not sufficient to      account for the whole of the phenomena of the sexual impulse. The      nervous circuit tends to involve a cerebral element, which may      sometimes be of dominant importance. Various investigators, from      the time of Gall onward, have attempted to localize the sexual      instinct centrally. Such attempts, however, cannot be said to      have succeeded, although they tend to show that there is a real      connection between the brain and the generative organs. Thus      Ceni, of Modena, by experiments on chickens, claims to have      proved the influence of the cortical centers of procreation on      the faculty of generation, for he found that lesions of the      cortex led to sterility corresponding in degree to the lesion;      but as these results followed even independently of any      disturbance of the sexual instinct, their significance is not      altogether clear (Carlo Ceni, \"L'Influenza dei Centri Corticali      sui Fenomeni della Generazione,\" _Revista Sperimentale di      Freniatria_, 1907, fasc. 2-3). At present, as Obici and      Marchesini have well remarked, all that we can do is to assume      the existence of cerebral as well as spinal sexual centers; a      cerebral sexual center, in the strictest sense, remains purely      hypothetical.        Although Gall's attempt to locate the sexual instinct in the      cerebellum--well supported as it was by observations--is no      longer considered to be tenable, his discussion of the sexual      instinct was of great value, far in advance of his time, and      accompanied by a mass of facts gathered from many fields. He      maintained that the sexual instinct is a function of the brain,      not of the sexual organs. He combated the view ruling in his day      that the seat of erotic mania must be sought in the sexual      organs. He fully dealt with the development of the sexual      instinct in many children before maturity of the sexual glands,      the prolongation of the instinct into old age, its existence in      the castrated and in the congenital absence of the sexual glands;      he pointed out that even with an apparently sound and normal      sexual apparatus all sorts of psychic pathological deviations may      yet occur. In fact, all the lines of argument I have briefly      indicated in the foregoing pages--although when they were first      written this fact was unknown to me--had been fully discussed by      this remarkable man nearly a century ago. (The greater part of      the third volume of Gall's _Sur les Fonctions du Cerveau_, in the      edition of 1825, is devoted to this subject. For a good summary,      sympathetic, though critical, of Gall's views on this matter, see      Moebius, \"Ueber Gall's Specielle Organologie,\" _Schmidt's"]]]
