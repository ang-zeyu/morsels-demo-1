I don't believe he would manufacture a  story out of whole cloth, but once his mind was set in a certain  direction he could build up a good one on very shaky foundations.  Perhaps he had an animus against these bumptious, undeferential,  overcritical Americans, and thought it was time to give one of them  a lesson. Perhaps he was tired of trapping ordinary garden variety  spies of the Belgian brand. It would be a pleasing variation in the  monotony of convicting defenseless, helpless Belgians if he  could show that one of these fellows masquerading as Americans  was a sham. Especially one of that journalistic tribe that had been  sending out reports of German atrocities. Furthermore, it would  redound greatly to his professional glory to hand me over to the  General with a case proved to the hilt.    There was no trick in the repertory of a prosecutor that was  unknown to Javert. He now shifted to the confidential and dropping  His voice very low, he said to me:    \"You know that if you make a full, complete confession, I'll promise  to do my very best for you. And as a matter of fact you have been  under the eyes of our Secret Service ever since you came to  Belgium. We are aware of everything that you have done.\"    Was that a bluff or the truth? If it was true then they knew about  my capture near Louvain on the day before in suspicious  observation of the signaling-balloon. If this was a bluff, then my  confession would be simply a case of gratuitously damning myself  and likewise endangering my companion of yesterday's adventure--the  British lieutenant with the American passport. Yet again if Javert  knew all he pretended to, silence about that episode would make  it appear doubly heinous. So while with my tongue I retailed a simple,  harmless version of my doings in Belgium in my brain I carried on a  debate whether to make an avowal of the Louvain escapade or not.    I came to the decision that Javert was just bluffing. Later  developments proved me right. He knew nothing about it. Even  the German Secret Service is not omniscient. Getting no results  then from these wheedling tactics Javert shifted back to his  bullying and essayed once more to browbeat me into a confession.  Calling to his aid two officers who had been but casual onlookers  they began volleying charges at me with machine-gun rapidity.    \"You know that you are a spy.\" \"We know that you are a spy.\"  \"Why do you deny it?\" \"You know that you have been lying.\"  \"Better own up to all that you have done.\" \"Out with it now!\"    When one officer grew tired, he rested. Then the next one took up  the attack, and then he rested. But not one moment's respite for  me. I don't know what they call it in German, but it was the third  degree with a vengeance. Under this sweating process my nerves  were being torn to tatters. I felt like screaming and it seemed that if  this continued I would smash an officer with a chair and put an end  to it all. But the fact that I am writing these lines shows that I didn't.  Human nature is so constituted that it can always endure a little  more, and though they kept the tension high for many minutes I  did not buckle under the strain. However, I couldn't call up any  arguments to show the utter absurdity of the charge against me.  And my defense was very feeble.    The onslaught now ceased as suddenly as it had begun. There  was a coming and going of officers and some consultation in an  undertone. The judge left the room and the impassive-faced  Javert began that machine-like writing. After a while he stopped.    \"Will you give me some idea of what you expect to do with me?\" I  queried.    \"A full report of your case goes up to the General for decision and  sentence,\" was his response.    My spirits took a downward plunge. Then a fierce resentment  amounting almost to rage came surging up within me. Masking it  as well as I could, I asked permission to send word to the  American authorities. Javert's reply was evasive.    \"I have had nothing to eat all day,\" I announced. \"Can't you do  something for me?\"    \"Go to that door there and open it,\" said Javert.    I did so and there stood four soldiers of the Kaiser, who ranged  themselves two in front and two behind, and marched me away.  Javert had a well-developed sense of the dramatic.    While I am excoriating Javert as representing the genius of  German officialdom, it is only fair that I should present his  antithesis. By continually referring to the German army as a  machine one gets the idea that it is an impersonal collection of  inhuman beings remorselessly and mechanically devoted to duty.  For a broad general impression that is perhaps a fair enough  statement to start with; but when I am tempted to let it go at that,  there is one striking exception that always rises up to point the  finger of denial at this easy and common generalization. It is that of  a young German officer, a mere stripling of twenty or thereabouts,  with the most frank, open, ingenuous expression. One would  expect to find him presiding at a Christian Endeavor social, rather  than right here at the very pivot of the most terrible military  organization of the world.    I had caught his look riveted upon me in my trial, and recognized  him when he came into the detention-room, to which the four  soldiers had led me. Hurriedly, he said to me: \"Really, you know, I  ought not to come in here, but I heard your story, and it looks  rather bad; but somehow I almost believe in you. Tell me the whole  truth about your affair.\"    I proceeded vehemently to point out my innocence, when he  interrupted my story by asking, \"But why did you make that  Schreibfehler on your paper?\" He followed my recital anxiously  and sympathetically, and, looking me full in the face, asked, \"Can  you tell me on your Ehrenwort (word of honor) that you are not a  spy? Remember,\" he added, solemnly, \"on your Ehrenwort.\"    Grasping both of his hands and looking him in the eye, I said, most  fervently, \"On my Ehrenwort, I am not a spy.\"    There was an earnestness in my heart that must have  communicated itself to my hands, because he winced as he drew  his hands away; but he said, \"I shall try to put in a word for you; I  can't do much, but I shall do what I can. I must go now. Good-by.\"          Chapter III    A Night On A Prison Floor        \"Prisoners are to be taken over into the left wing for the night,\" said  an orderly to the guards.    We had scarcely turned the corner, when an officer cried: \"Not that  way, Dummkopf!\"    \"Our orders are for the left wing, sir,\" said the orderly.    \"Never saw such a set of damned blockheads!\" yelled the officer  in exasperation. \"Can't you tell the difference between right and  left? Right wing, right wing, and hurry up!\"    A little emery had gotten into the perfect-running machine. The  corridors fairly clanged with orders and counter orders. After much  confusion the general mix-up of prisoners was straightened out  and we were served black bread and coffee.    The strain of the day, along with the fever I had from exposure on  the battlefields, made the rough food still more uninviting,  especially as our only implements of attack were the greasy  pocketknives of the peasants and canteen covers from the  soldiers. The revolt of my stomach must have communicated itself  to my soul. I determined for aggressive action on my own behalf. I  resolved to stand unprotesting no longer while a solid case against  me was being constructed. Not without a struggle was I to be  railroaded off to prison or to Purgatory. Pushing up to the next  officer appearing in the room, in firm but courteous tones I  requested, as an American citizen, the right to communicate with  the American authorities.    He replied very decently that that was quite within my privileges,  and forthwith the opportunity would be accorded me. I was looking  for paper, when there came the order for all of us to move out into  the courtyard. With a line of soldiers on either side, we were  marched through labyrinthine passages and up three flights of  stairs. Here we were divided into two gangs, my gang being led off  into a room already nearly filled. We were told that it was our  temporary abode, and we were to make the best of it. It was an  administrative office of the Belgian Government now turned into a  prison. There were the usual fixtures, including a rug on the floor  and shelves of books. Ours was only one of many cells for  prisoners scattered through the building. The spy-hunters had  swooped down upon every suspect in Belgium and all who had  been caught in the dragnet were being dumped into these rooms.    We were thus informed by the officer whose wards we were. He  was a fussy, quick-tempered, withal kind-hearted little fellow, and  kept dashing in and out of the room, really perplexed over housing  accommodations for the night. The spy-hunters had been successful  in their work of rounding up their victims from all over the country and  corralling them here until the place was filled to overflowing. Our  official in charge was puffed up with pride in the prosperity of his  institution, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, petulantly belectured  us on adding ourselves to his already numerous burdens. This  was highly humorous, yet we all feared to commit lese-majeste  by expressing to him our collective and personal sorrow for  so inconveniencing him, and our willingness to make amends  for our thoughtlessness in getting arrested.    After more hesitation than I had hitherto observed, arrangements  for the night were completed and we were ordered to draw out  blankets from the pile in the corner.

Here Latinus, the reigning king, received  the exiles hospitably, and promised his daughter Lavin'ia in marriage  to AEneas; but she had been already betrothed by her mother to prince  Turnus, son of Daunus, king of Ru'tuli, and Turnus would not forego  his claim.
