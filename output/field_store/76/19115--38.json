[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11438"],[0,"The Willows (#5)"],[1,"figures still rose from earth to heaven, silent, majestically, in a great  spiral of grace and strength that overwhelmed me at length with a genuine  deep emotion of worship. I felt that I must fall down and  worship--absolutely worship.    Perhaps in another minute I might have done so, when a gust of wind swept  against me with such force that it blew me sideways, and I nearly stumbled  and fell. It seemed to shake the dream violently out of me. At least it  gave me another point of view somehow. The figures still remained, still  ascended into heaven from the heart of the night, but my reason at last  began to assert itself. It must be a subjective experience, I argued--none  the less real for that, but still subjective. The moonlight and the  branches combined to work out these pictures upon the mirror of my  imagination, and for some reason I projected them outwards and made them  appear objective. I knew this must be the case, of course. I took courage,  and began to move forward across the open patches of sand. By Jove, though,  was it all hallucination? Was it merely subjective? Did not my reason argue  in the old futile way from the little standard of the known?    I only know that great column of figures ascended darkly into the sky for  what seemed a very long period of time, and with a very complete measure of  reality as most men are accustomed to gauge reality. Then suddenly they  were gone!    And, once they were gone and the immediate wonder of their great presence  had passed, fear came down upon me with a cold rush. The esoteric meaning  of this lonely and haunted region suddenly flamed up within me, and I began  to tremble dreadfully. I took a quick look round--a look of horror that  came near to panic--calculating vainly ways of escape; and then, realizing  how helpless I was to achieve anything really effective, I crept back  silently into the tent and lay down again upon my sandy mattress, first  lowering the door-curtain to shut out the sight of the willows in the  moonlight, and then burying my head as deeply as possible beneath the  blankets to deaden the sound of the terrifying wind.    As though further to convince me that I had not been dreaming, I remember  that it was a long time before I fell again into a troubled and restless  sleep; and even then only the upper crust of me slept, and underneath there  was something that never quite lost consciousness, but lay alert and on the  watch.    But this second time I jumped up with a genuine start of terror. It was  neither the wind nor the river that woke me, but the slow approach of  something that caused the sleeping portion of me to grow smaller and  smaller till at last it vanished altogether, and I found myself sitting  bolt upright--listening.    Outside there was a sound of multitudinous little patterings. They had been  coming, I was aware, for a long time, and in my sleep they had first become  audible. I sat there nervously wide awake as though I had not slept at all.  It seemed to me that my breathing came with difficulty, and that there was  a great weight upon the surface of my body. In spite of the hot night, I  felt clammy with cold and shivered. Something surely was pressing steadily  against the sides of the tent and weighing down upon it from above. Was it  the body of the wind? Was this the pattering rain, the dripping of the  leaves? The spray blown from the river by the wind and gathering in big  drops? I thought quickly of a dozen things.    Then suddenly the explanation leaped into my mind: a bough from the poplar,  the only large tree on the island, had fallen with the wind. Still half  caught by the other branches, it would fall with the next gust and crush  us, and meanwhile its leaves brushed and tapped upon the tight canvas  surface of the tent. I raised a loose flap and rushed out, calling to the  Swede to follow.    But when I got out and stood upright I saw that the tent was free. There  was no hanging bough; there was no rain or spray; nothing approached.    A cold, grey light filtered down through the bushes and lay on the faintly  gleaming sand. Stars still crowded the sky directly overhead, and the wind  howled magnificently, but the fire no longer gave out any glow, and I saw  the east reddening in streaks through the trees. Several hours must have  passed since I stood there before watching the ascending figures, and the  memory of it now came back to me horribly, like an evil dream. Oh, how  tired it made me feel, that ceaseless raging wind! Yet, though the deep  lassitude of a sleepless night was on me, my nerves were tingling with the  activity of an equally tireless apprehension, and all idea of repose was  out of the question. The river I saw had risen further. Its thunder filled  the air, and a fine spray made itself felt through my thin sleeping shirt.    Yet nowhere did I discover the slightest evidence of anything to cause  alarm. This deep, prolonged disturbance in my heart remained wholly  unaccounted for.    My companion had not stirred when I called him, and there was no need to  waken him now. I looked about me carefully, noting everything; the  turned-over canoe; the yellow paddles--two of them, I'm certain; the  provision sack and the extra lantern hanging together from the tree; and,  crowding everywhere about me, enveloping all, the willows, those endless,  shaking willows. A bird uttered its morning cry, and a string of duck  passed with whirring flight overhead in the twilight. The sand whirled, dry  and stinging, about my bare feet in the wind.    I walked round the tent and then went out a little way into the bush, so  that I could see across the river to the farther landscape, and the same  profound yet indefinable emotion of distress seized upon me again as I saw  the interminable sea of bushes stretching to the horizon, looking ghostly  and unreal in the wan light of dawn. I walked softly here and there, still  puzzling over that odd sound of infinite pattering, and of that pressure  upon the tent that had wakened me. It must have been the wind, I  reflected--the wind bearing upon the loose, hot sand, driving the dry  particles smartly against the taut canvas--the wind dropping heavily upon  our fragile roof.    Yet all the time my nervousness and malaise increased appreciably.    I crossed over to the farther shore and noted how the coast-line had  altered in the night, and what masses of sand the river had torn away. I  dipped my hands and feet into the cool current, and bathed my forehead.  Already there was a glow of sunrise in the sky and the exquisite freshness  of coming day. On my way back I passed purposely beneath the very bushes  where I had seen the column of figures rising into the air, and midway  among the clumps I suddenly found myself overtaken by a sense of vast  terror. From the shadows a large figure went swiftly by. Someone passed me,  as sure as ever man did....    It was a great staggering blow from the wind that helped me forward again,  and once out in the more open space, the sense of terror diminished  strangely. The winds were about and walking, I remember saying to myself,  for the winds often move like great presences under the trees. And  altogether the fear that hovered about me was such an unknown and immense  kind of fear, so unlike anything I had ever felt before, that it woke a  sense of awe and wonder in me that did much to counteract its worst  effects; and when I reached a high point in the middle of the island from  which I could see the wide stretch of river, crimson in the sunrise, the  whole magical beauty of it all was so overpowering that a sort of wild  yearning woke in me and almost brought a cry up into the throat.    But this cry found no expression, for as my eyes wandered from the plain  beyond to the island round me and noted our little tent half hidden among  the willows, a dreadful discovery leaped out at me, compared to which my  terror of the walking winds seemed as nothing at all.    For a change, I thought, had somehow come about in the arrangement of the  landscape. It was not that my point of vantage gave me a different view,  but that an alteration had apparently been effected in the relation of the  tent to the willows, and of the willows to the tent. Surely the bushes now  crowded much closer--unnecessarily, unpleasantly close. They had moved  nearer.    Creeping with silent feet over the shifting sands, drawing imperceptibly  nearer by soft, unhurried movements, the willows had come closer during the  night. But had the wind moved them, or had they moved of themselves? I  recalled the sound of infinite small patterings and the pressure upon the  tent and upon my own heart that caused me to wake in terror. I swayed for a  moment in the wind like a tree, finding it hard to keep my upright position  on the sandy hillock. There was a suggestion here of personal agency, of  deliberate intention, of aggressive hostility, and it terrified me into a  sort of rigidity.    Then the reaction followed quickly. The idea was so bizarre, so absurd,  that I felt inclined to laugh. But the laughter came no more readily than  the cry, for the knowledge that my mind was so receptive to such dangerous  imaginings brought the additional terror that it was through our minds and  not through our physical bodies that the attack would come, and was coming.    The wind buffeted me about, and, very quickly it seemed, the sun came up  over the horizon, for it was after four o'clock, and I must have stood on  that little pinnacle of sand longer than I knew, afraid to come down to  close quarters with the willows. I returned quietly, creepily, to the tent,  first taking another exhaustive look round and--yes, I confess it--making a  few measurements. I paced out on the warm sand the distances between the  willows and the tent, making a note of the shortest distance particularly.    I crawled stealthily into my blankets.

It were easy to see had you been travelling late on that  inauspicious night, that the burden of the sack was far too great for  the poor old man that bore it.  And had you flashed a lantern in his  face there was a look there of hopelessness and fatigue that would  have told you it was no wish of his that kept him tottering on under  that bloated sack.    When the menacing look of the night and its cheerless sounds, and the  cold, and the weight of the sack, had all but brought him to the door  of death, and he had dropped his sack onto the road and was dragging  it on behind him, just as he felt that his final hour was come, and  come (which was worse) as he held the accursed sack, just then he saw  the bulk and the black shape of the Sign of the Lost Shepherd loom up  by the ragged way.  He opened the door and staggered into the light  and sank on a bench with his huge sack beside him.    All this you had seen had you been on that lonely road, so late on  those bitter wolds, with their outlines vast and mournful in the dark,  and their little clumps of trees sad with October.  But neither you  nor I were out that night.  I did not see the poor old man and his  sack until he sank down all of a heap in the lighted inn.    And Yon the blacksmith was there; and the carpenter, Willie Losh; and  Jackers, the postman's son.  And they gave him a glass of beer. And  the old man drank it up, still hugging his emeralds.    And at last they asked him what he had in his sack, the question he  clearly dreaded; and he only clasped yet tighter the sodden sack and  mumbled he had potatoes.    \"Potatoes,\" said Yon the blacksmith.    \"Potatoes,\" said Willie Losh.    And when he heard the doubt that was in their voices the old man  shivered and moaned.    \"Potatoes, did you say?\" said the postman's son.  And they all three  rose and tried to peer at the sack that the rain-soaked wayfarer so  zealously sheltered.    And from the old man's fierceness I had said that, had it not been for  that foul night on the roads and the weight he had carried so far and  the fearful winds of October, he had fought with the blacksmith, the  carpenter and the postman's son, all three, till he beat them away  from his sack.  And weary and wet as he was he fought them hard.    I should no doubt have interfered; and yet the three men meant no harm  to the wayfarer, but resented the reticence that he displayed to them  though they had given him beer; it was to them as though a master key  had failed to open a cupboard.  And, as for me, curiosity held me down  to my chair and forbade me to interfere on behalf of the sack; for the  old man's furtive ways, and the night out of which he came, and the  hour of his coming, and the look of his sack, all made me long as much  to know what he had, as even the blacksmith, the carpenter and the  postman's son.    And then they found the emeralds.  They were all bigger than hazel  nuts, hundreds and hundreds of them: and the old man screamed.    \"Come, come, we're not thieves,\" said the blacksmith.    \"We're not thieves,\" said the carpenter.    \"We're not thieves,\" said the postman's son.    And with awful fear on his face the wayfarer closed his sack,  whimpering over his emeralds and furtively glancing round as though  the loss of his secret were and utterly deadly thing.  And then they  asked him to give them just one each, just one huge emerald each,  because they had given him a glass of beer.  Then to see the wayfarer  shrink against his sack and guard it with clutching fingers one would  have said that he was a selfish man, were it not for the terror that  was freezing his face.  I have seen men look sheer at Death with far  less fear.    And they took their emerald all three, one enormous emerald each,  while the old man hopelessly struggled till he saw his three emeralds  go, and fell to the floor and wept, a pitiable, sodden heap.    And about that time I began to hear far off down the windy road, by  which that sack had come, faintly at first and slowly louder and  louder, the click clack clop of a lame horse coming nearer.  Click  clack clop and a loose shoe rattling, the sound of a horse too weary  to be out upon such a night, too lame to be out at all.    Click clack clop.  And all of a sudden the old wayfarer heard it;  heard it above the sound of his won sobbing, and at once went white to  the lips.  Such sudden fear as blanched him in a moment struck right  to the hearts of all there.  They muttered to him that it was only  their play, they hastily whispered excuses, they asked him what was  wrong, but seemed scarcely to hope for an answer, nor did he speak,  but sat with a frozen stare, all at once dry-eyed, a monument to  terror.    Nearer and nearer came the click clack clop.    And when I saw the expression of that man's face and how its horror  deepened as the ominous sound drew nearer, then I knew that something  was wrong.  And looking for the last time upon all four I saw the  wayfarer horror-struck by his sack and the other three crowding round  to put their huge emeralds back then, even on such a night, I slipped  away from the inn.    Outside the bitter wind roared in my ears, and close in the darkness  the horse went click clack clop.    And as soon as my eyes could see at all in the night I saw a man in a  huge hat looped up in front, wearing a sword in a scabbard shabby and  huge, and looking blacker than the darkness, riding on a lean horse  slowly up to the inn.  Whether his were the emeralds, or who he was,  or why he rode a lame horse on such a night, I did not stop to  discover, but went at once from the inn as he strode in his great  black riding coat up to the door.    And that was the last that was ever seen of the wayfarer; the  blacksmith, the carpenter or the postman's son.          THE OLD BROWN COAT    My friend, Mr. Douglas Ainslie, tells me that Sir James Barrie once  told him this story.  The story, or rather the fragment, was as  follows.    A man strolling into an auction somewhere abroad, I think it must have  been France, for they bid in francs, found they were selling old  clothes.  And following some idle whim he soon found himself bidding  for an old coat.  A man bid against him, he bid against the man. Up  and up went the price till the old coat was knocked down to him for  twenty pounds.  As he went away with the coat he saw the other bidder  looking at him with an expression of fury.    That's as far as the story goes.  But how, Mr. Ainslie asked me, did  the matter develop, and why that furious look?  I at once made  enquiries at a reliable source and have ascertained that the man's  name was Peters, who thus oddly purchased a coat, and that he took it  to the Rue de Rivoli, to a hotel where he lodged, from the little low,  dark auction room by the Seine in which he concluded the bargain.  There he examined it, off and on, all day and much of the next  morning, a light brown overcoat with tails, without discovering any  excuse, far less a reason, for having spent twenty pounds on so worn a  thing.  And late next morning to his sitting room looking out on the  Gardens of the Tuileries the man with the furious look was ushered in.    Grim he stood, silent and angry, till the guiding waiter went.  Not  till then did he speak, and his words came clear and brief, welling up  from deep emotions.    \"How did you dare to bid against me?\"    His name was Santiago.  And for many moments Peters found no excuse to  offer, no apology, nothing in extenuation.  Lamely at last, weakly,  knowing his argument to be of no avail, he muttered something to the  intent that Mr. Santiago could have outbid him.    \"No,\" said the stranger.  \"We don't want all the town in this.  This  is a matter between you and me.\"  He paused, then added in his fierce,  curt way: \"A thousand pounds, no more.\"    Almost dumbly Peters accepted the offer and, pocketing the thousand  pounds that was paid him, and apologizing for the inconvenience he had  unwittingly caused, tried to show the stranger out.  But Santiago  strode swiftly on before him, taking the coat, and was gone.    There followed between Peters and his second thoughts another long  afternoon of bitter reproaches.  Why ever had he let go so  thoughtlessly of a garment that so easily fetched a thousand pounds?  And the more he brooded on this the more clearly did he perceive that  he had lost an unusual opportunity of a first class investment of a  speculative kind.  He knew men perhaps better than he knew materials;  and, though he could not see in that old brown coat the value of so  much as a thousand pounds, he saw far more than that in the man's  eager need for it.  An afternoon of brooding over lost opportunities  led to a night of remorse, and scarcely had day dawned when he ran to  his sitting-room to see if he still had safe the card of Santiago. And  there was the neat and perfumed _carte de visite_ with Santiago's  Parisian address in the corner.    That morning he sought him out, and found Santiago seated at a table  with chemicals and magnifying glasses beside him examining, as it lay  spread wide before him, the old brown coat.  And Peters fancied he  wore a puzzled air.    They came at once to business.  Peters was rich and asked Santiago to  name his price, and that small dark man admitted financial straits,  and so was willing to sell"]]]
