[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11204"],[0,"Diseases of the Horse's Foot (#5)"],[1," THE EXTENSOR PEDIS.--The extensor pedis arises from the lower extremity  of the humerus in two distinct portions of unequal size, a muscular and a  tendinous. These are succeeded by two tendons passing in common through a  vertical groove at the lower end of the radius. Lower in the limb these  tendons separate, the outer and smaller joining the tendon of the extensor  suffraginis, and the inner and main tendon continuing its course downwards.  With the exception of the navicular, it is attached to all the bones of the  foot, and is covered internally by the capsular ligaments of the joints  over which it passes, those with which we are concerned being the pastern  joint and the pedal joint. Before its attachment to the os pedis it  receives on each side of the middle of the first phalanx reinforcement in  the shape of a strong band descending obliquely over the fetlock from the  suspensory ligament. Widening out in fanlike fashion, it is inserted into  the pyramidal process of the os pedis.    _Action_.--The action of this muscle is to extend the third phalanx on the  second, the second on the first, and the first on the metacarpus. It also  assists in the extension of the foot on the forearm.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--THE FLEXOR TENDONS AND EXTENSOR PEDIS.

It is reinforced at the lower end of the  radius by the superior carpal ligament, passes through the carpal and  metacarpo-phalangeal sheaths, and, arriving behind the fetlock, forms a  ring for the passage of the flexor perforans. Its termination is bifid, and  it is inserted on either side to the lateral surface of the second phalanx.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--THE FLEXOR PERFORANS AND FLEXOR PERFORATUS  TENDONS. The metacarpo-phalangeal sheath and the ring of the perforatus  laid open posteriorly, and the cut edges reflected to show the passage  of the perforans. 1, Reflected cut edges of the perforatus ring and the  metacarpo-phalangeal sheath; 2, the perforans tendon; 3, point of insertion  of the perforans tendon into the semilunar crest of the os pedis (this  widened and thickened extremity of the perforans is known as the plantar  aponeurosis).]    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--THE FLEXOR PERFORATUS AND FLEXOR PERFORANS  TENDONS.

Mechanically, it  acts as a stay when the animal is standing by maintaining the  metacarpo-phalangeal angle.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--MEDIAN SECTION OF FOOT. _A_, Os suffraginis; _B_,  os coronae; _C_, os pedis; _D_, navicular bone; _E_, tendon of the extensor  pedis; _F_, insertion of the extensor pedis into the pyramidal process of  the os pedis; _G_, the tendon of the flexor perforatus; _H_, insertion of  perforatus into the os coronae; _I_, tendon of the flexor perforans; _J_,  its passing attachment to the os coronae; _K_, its final insertion into the  semilunar crest of os pedis; _a_, section of coronary cushion; _b_, section  of plantar cushion; _c_, semilunar sinus of os pedis.]    THE FLEXOR PEDIS PERFORANS, OR THE DEEP FLEXOR OF THE PHALANGES.--This  muscle consists of three easily-divided portions: an ulnar, a humeral, and  a radial, and has for points of origin the olecranon process of the ulna,  the inner condyloid ridge of the humerus, and the posterior surface of the  radius. These portions are continued by a common tendon which enters the  carpal sheath with the tendon of the perforatus, and continues with it  through the synovial sheath of the metacarpo-phalangeal region. Like the  last-named tendon, it receives a supporting check-band, in this case from  the posterior ligament of the carpus. Passing down between the suspensory  ligament in front, and the perforatus tendon behind, it glides over the  sesamoid pulley and passes through the ring formed by the perforatus.  Continuing its course, it passes between the bifurcating portions of the  extremity of the perforatus, glides over the smooth posterior surface of  the supplementary glenoid cartilage of the articulation of the first and  second phalanges, plays over the inferior surface of the navicular bone,  and finally becomes inserted into the semilunar crest of the os pedis. On  reaching the posterior border of the navicular bone it widens out to form  the plantar aponeurosis.    In connection with the lower portion of this tendon must be noticed the  Navicular Sheath. This is a synovial sheath lining the deep face of the  tendon, and reflected on to the navicular bone and the interosseous  ligament of the pedal joint. This will be of particular interest when we  come to deal with cases of pricked foot from picked up nails. Above, it is  in connection with the synovial membrane of the pedal articulation and that  of the metacarpo-phalangeal sheath.    _Action_.--The action of the perforans is to flex the third on the second,  and the second on the first phalanx. The latter it flexes in turn on the  metacarpus. It also assists in the flexion of the entire foot on the  forearm, and in supporting the angle of the metacarpo-phalangeal  articulation when the animal is standing.      D. THE ARTERIES.    So far as the arteries supplying the foot are concerned, we shall be  interested in following up the distribution of the two digitals, which are  the terminal branches of the Large Metacarpal.    THE LARGE METACARPAL, OR COLLATERAL ARTERY OF THE CANNON.--This, the larger  terminal branch of the posterior radial artery, needs brief mention, for  the reason that we shall be afterwards concerned with it in the operation  of neurectomy. Its point of origin is the inside of the inferior extremity  of the radius. Descending in company with the flexor tendons, and passing  behind the carpus and beneath the carpal sheath, it continues its descent,  in company with the internal plantar nerve and the internal metacarpal  vein, on the inner side of the flexor tendons until just above the fetlock.  At this point it bifurcates into the digital arteries.    From the carpus downwards the large metacarpal artery, the internal  metacarpal vein, and the internal plantar nerve are in close relation with  each other. The vein holds the anterior position. The artery is between the  two, and has the nerve in close contact with it behind.    THE DIGITAL ARTERIES, OR COLLATERAL ARTERIES OF THE DIGIT.--These are of  large volume, and carry the blood to the keratogenous apparatus of the  foot. They separate from each other at an acute angle, and pass over the  side of the fetlock, one to the inside, the other to the outside, to reach  the internal face of the basilar process of the os pedis, where they  bifurcate to form the _Plantar_ and _Preplantar_ arteries. In the whole  of their course the digital arteries follow the flexor tendons, and are  related in front to the digital vein, and behind to the posterior branch of  the plantar nerve. This is the nerve implicated in the lower operation of  neurectomy, and its relation to adjoining structures will be detailed  under Section F. of this chapter. During its course the digital artery  gives off branches in the following positions:    1. _At the Fetlock_ numerous branches to the metacarpo-phalangeal  articulation, the sesamoid sheath, and the tendons.    2. _At the Upper Extremity of the First Phalanx_ branches for the supply of  the surrounding tissues, and for the tissues of the ergot.    3. _Towards the Middle of the Third Phalanx_, the _Perpendicular_ artery  of Percival. This arises at a right angle from the main vessel, and  immediately divides into two series of ramifications--an ascending and  a descending. The ramifications of these series freely anastomose with  corresponding vessels of the opposite side.    4. _At the Superior Border of the Lateral Cartilage_, the _Artery of the  Plantar Cushion_. This is directed obliquely downwards and backwards, under  cover of the cartilage, and is distributed to the middle portion of the  complementary apparatus of the os pedis, as well as to the villous tissue  and the coronet. A branch of it is turned forwards to join with the  coronary circle in forming the _circumflex artery of the coronet_.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--THE ARTERIES OF THE FOOT. The digital; 2, the  perpendicular--(_a_) its ascending branch, (_b_) its descending branch;  3, circumflex artery of coronary cushion; 4, the preplantar (ungual)  artery--this is seen issuing from the preplantar foramen, and distributing  numerous ascending (_c_) and descending (_d_) branches (the latter concur  in forming the circumflex artery of the toe); 5, the circumflex artery  of the toe; 6, at the point marked (*) the terminal branch of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11212"],[0,"Modern India (#5)"],[1,"in any town. The guidebook  says that during the last quarter of a century patriotic residents  of Bombay, mostly natives, have given more than $5,000,000 for  public edifices. It is a new form for the expression of patriotism  that might be encouraged in the United States.    Several statues were also gifts to the city; that of Queen Victoria,  which is one of the finest I have ever seen, having been erected  by the Maharajah of Baroda, and that of the Prince of Wales by Sir  Edward Beohm. These are the best, but there are several others.  Queen Victoria's monument, which stands in the most prominent  plaza, where the busiest thoroughfares meet, represents that  good woman sitting upon her throne under a lofty Gothic canopy  of marble. The carving is elaborate and exquisite. In the center  of the canopy appears the Star of India, and above it the Rose  of England, united with the Lotus of India, with the mottoes of  both countries intertwined--\"God and My Right\" and \"Heaven's  Light Our Guide.\"    Queen Victoria was no stranger to the people of India. They felt a  personal relationship with their empress, and many touching incidents  are told that have occurred from time to time to illustrate the  affection of the Hindus for her. They were taught to call her  \"The Good Lady of England,\" and almost every mail, while she  was living, carried letters from India to London bearing that  address. They came mostly from Hindu women who had learned of  her goodness, sympathy and benevolence and hired public scribes  at the market places to tell her of their sufferings and wrongs.    In the center of another plaza facing a street called Rampart  row, which is lined by lofty buildings containing the best retail  shops in town, is a figure of Edward VII. in bronze, on horseback,  presented by a local merchant. Near the cathedral is a statute  to Lord Cornwallis, who was governor general of India in 1786,  and, as the inscription informs us, died at Ghazipur, Oct. 5,  1805. This was erected by the merchants of Bombay, who paid a  similar honor to the Marquis of Wellesley, younger brother of  the Duke of Wellington, who was also governor general during  the days of the East India Company, and did a great deal for the  country. He was given a purse of $100,000, and his statue was  erected in Bombay, but he died unhappy because the king refused  to create him Duke of Hindustan, the only honor that would have  satisfied his soul. There are several fine libraries in Bombay,  and the Asiatic Society, which has existed since the beginning of  the nineteenth century, has one of the largest and most valuable  collections of oriental literature in existence.    For three miles and a half the boulevard, and its several branches  are bounded by charming residences, which overlook the bay and  the roofs of the city. Malabar Point at the end of the drive,  the extreme end of the island upon which Bombay is built, is  the government house, the residence of the Lord Lamington, who  represents King Edward VII. in this beautiful city. It is a series  of bungalows, with large, cool rooms and deep verandas, shaded  by immense trees and luxurious vines, and has accommodations  altogether for about 100 people. The staff of the governor is  quite large. He has all kinds of aides-de-camp, secretaries and  attaches, and maintains quite a little court. Indeed, his quarters,  his staff and his style of living are much more pretentious than  those of the President of the United States, and his salary is  quite as large. Everywhere he goes he is escorted by a bodyguard  of splendid looking native soldiers in scarlet uniforms, big  turbans and long spears. They are Sikhs, from the north of India,  the greatest fighters in the empire, men of large stature, military  bearing and unswerving loyalty to the British crown, and when  the Governor of Bombay drives in to his office in the morning  or drives back again to his lovely home at night, his carriage  is surrounded by a squad of those tawny warriors, who ride as  well as they look.    About half-way on the road to the government house is the Gymkhana,  and I venture to say that nobody who has not been in India can  guess what that means. And if you want another conundrum, what  is a chotohazree? It is customary for smart people to have their  chotohazree at the Gymkhana, and I think that you would be pleased  to join them after taking the beautiful drive which leads to the  place. Nobody knows what the word was derived from, but it is used  to describe a country club--a bungalow hidden under a beautiful  grove on the brow of a cliff that overhangs the bay--with all of  the appurtenances, golf links, tennis courts, cricket grounds,  racquet courts and indoor gymnasium, and everybody stops there on  their afternoon drive to have chotohazree, which is the local  term for afternoon tea and for early morning coffee.    There are peculiar customs in Bombay. The proper time for making  visits everywhere in India is between 11 a. m. and 1:30 p. m.,  and fashionable ladies are always at home between those hours  and seldom at any other. It seems unnatural, because they are  the hottest of the day. One would think that common sense as  well as comfort would induce people to stay at home at noon and  make themselves as cool as possible. In other tropical countries  these are the hours of the siesta, the noonday nap, which is as  common and as necessary as breakfast or dinner, and none but  a lunatic would think of calling upon a friend after 11 in the  morning or before 3 in the afternoon. It would be as ridiculous  as to return a social visit at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning,  and the same reasons which govern that custom ought to apply  in India as well as in Egypt, Cuba or Brazil. But here ladies  put on their best gowns, order their carriages, take their card  cases, and start out in the burning noontide glare to return  visits and make formal dinner and party calls. Strangers are  expected to do the same, and if you have letters of introduction  you are expected to present them during those hours, and not at  any other time. In the cool of the day, after 5 o'clock, everybody  who owns or can hire a carriage goes out to drive, and usually  stops at the Gymkhana in the country or at the Yacht Club in  the city for chotohazree. It is a good custom to admit women  to clubs as they do here. The wives and daughters of members  have every privilege, and can give tea parties and luncheons in  the clubhouses, while on certain evenings of the week a band is  brought from the military barracks and everybody of any account  in European society is expected to be present. Tables are spread  over the lawn, and are engaged in advance by ladies, who sit  behind them, receive visits and pour tea just as they would do  in their own houses. It is a very pleasant custom.    All visitors who intend to remain in Bombay for any length of  time are expected to call upon the governor and his wife, but it  is not necessary for them to drive out to Malabar Point for such a  purpose. On a table in the reception room of the government building  down-town are two books in which you write your name and address,  and that is considered equivalent to a formal visit. One book is  intended exclusively for those who have been \"presented\" and by  signing it they are reminding his excellency and her excellency  of their continued existence and notifying them where invitations  to dinners and balls can reach them. The other book is designed for  strangers and travelers, who inscribe their names and professions,  where they live when they are at home, how long they expect to  be in Bombay and where they are stopping. Anybody who desires  can sign this book and the act is considered equivalent to a  call upon the governor. If the caller has a letter of introduction  to His Excellency he can leave it, with a card, in charge of the  clerk who looks after the visitors' book, and if he desires to  see the governor personally for business or social reasons he  can express that desire upon a sheet of note paper, which will  be attached to the letter of introduction and delivered some time  during the day. The latter, if he is so disposed will then give  the necessary instructions and an aide-de-camp will send a \"chit,\"  as they call a note over here, inviting the traveler to call at  an hour named. There is a great deal of formality in official  and social life. The ceremonies and etiquette are modeled upon  those of the royal palaces in England, and the governor of each  province, as well as the viceroy of India in Calcutta, has his  little court.    A different code of etiquette must be followed in social relations  with natives, because they do not usually open their houses to  strangers. Letters of introduction should be sent with cards  by messengers or through the mails. Then, if the gentleman to  whom they are addressed desires, he will call at your hotel.  Many of the wealthier natives, and especially the Parsees, are  adopting European customs, but the more conservative Hindus still  adhere to their traditional exclusive habits, their families are  invisible and never mentioned, and strangers are never admitted  to their homes.    Natives are not admitted to the European clubs. There is no mingling  of the races in society, except in a few isolated cases of wealthy  families, who have been educated in Europe and have adopted European  customs. While the same prejudice does not exist theoretically,  there is actually a social gulf as wide and as deep as that which  lies between white and black families in Savannah or New Orleans.  Occasionally there is a marriage between a European and a native,  but the social consequences have not encouraged others to imitate  the example. Such unions are not approved by public sentiment in  either race, and are not usually attended with happiness. Some  of the Parsees, who are always excepted, and are"]]]
