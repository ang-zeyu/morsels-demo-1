I'll take my hat off to the man that got it,  however, and charge it up to my tuition account.\"    \"You big chump, you! if you hadn't bet your overcoat it wouldn't be so  bad. What possessed you to bet it?\" asked Stubb, half reprovingly.    \"Oh, hell, I'll not need it. It's not going to be a very cold winter,  nohow,\" replied Baugh, as he threw up one eye toward the warm sun.  \"We need exercise. Let's walk back to town. Now, this is a little  unexpected, but what have I got you boy's for, if you can't help a  friend in trouble. There's one good thing--I've got my board paid  three weeks in advance; paid it this morning out of yesterday's  winnings. Lucky, ain't I?\"    \"Yes, you're powerful lucky. You're alive, ain't you?\" said Stubb,  rubbing salt into his wounds.    \"Now, my dear Stubby, don't get gay with the leading lady; you may get  in a bad box some day and need me.\"    This turn of affairs was looked upon by Stubb and Arab as quite a joke  on their leader. But it was no warning to them, and they continued  to play their favorite games, Stubb at poker, while Arab gave his  attention to monte. Things ran along for a few weeks in this manner,  Baugh never wanting for a dollar or the necessary liquids that cheer  the despondent. Finally they were forced to take an inventory of their  cash and similar assets. The result was suggestive that they would  have to return to the chuck-line, or unearth some other resource. The  condition of their finances lacked little of the red-ink line.    Baugh, who had been silent during this pow-wow, finally said, \"My  board will have to be provided for in a few days, but I have an idea,  struck it to-day, and if she works, we'll pull through to grass like  four time winners.\"    \"What is it?\" asked the other two, in a chorus.    \"There's a little German on a back street here, who owns a bar-room  with a hotel attached. He has a mania to run for office; in fact,  there's several candidates announced already. Now, the convention  don't meet until May, which is in our favor. If my game succeeds, we  will be back at work before that time. That will let us out easy.\"    As their finances were on a parity with Baugh's, the others were  willing to undertake anything that looked likely to tide them over the  winter. \"Leave things to me,\" said Baugh. \"I'll send a friend around  to sound our German, and see what office he thinks he'd like to have.\"    The information sought developed the fact that it was the office of  sheriff that he wanted. When the name was furnished, the leader of  this scheme wrote it on a card--Seigerman, Louie Seigerman,--not  trusting to memory. Baugh now reduced their finances further for a  shave, while he meditated how he would launch his scheme. An hour  afterwards, he walked up to the bar, and asked, \"Is Mr. Seigerman in?\"    \"Dot ish my name, sir,\" said the man behind the bar.    \"Could I see you privately for a few minutes?\" asked Baugh, who  himself could speak German, though his tongue did not indicate it.    \"In von moment,\" said Seigerman, as he laid off his white apron and  called an assistant to take his place. He then led the way to a back  room, used for a storehouse. \"Now, mine frendt, vat ish id?\" inquired  Louie, when they were alone.    \"My name is Baughman,\" said he, as he shook Louie's hand with a hearty  grip. \"I work for the Continental Cattle Company, who own a range  in the strip adjoining the county line below here. My people have  suffered in silence from several bands of cattle thieves who have  headquarters in this county. Heretofore we have never taken any  interest in the local politics of this community. But this year we  propose to assert ourselves, and try to elect a sheriff who will  do his sworn duty, and run out of this county these rustling cattle  thieves. Mr. Seigerman, it would surprise you did I give you the  figures in round numbers of the cattle that my company have lost by  these brand-burning rascals who infest this section.    \"Now to business, as you are a business man. I have come to ask you to  consent to your name being presented to the county convention,  which meets in May, as a candidate for the office of sheriff of this  county.\"    As Louie scratched his head and was meditating on his reply, Baughman  continued: \"Now, we know that you are a busy man, and have given this  matter no previous thought, so we do not insist on an immediate reply.  But think it over, and let me impress on your mind that if you consent  to make the race, you will have the support of every cattle-man in  the country. Not only their influence and support, but in a selfish  interest will their purses be at your command to help elect you. This  request of mine is not only the mature conclusion of my people, but we  have consulted others interested, and the opinion seems unanimous that  you are the man to make the race for this important office.\"    \"Mr. Baughman, vill you not haf one drink mit me?\" said Seigerman, as  he led the way towards the bar.    \"If you will kindly excuse me, Mr. Seigerman, I never like to indulge  while attending to business matters. I'll join you in a cigar,  however, for acquaintance' sake.\"    When the cigars were lighted Baugh observed, \"Why, do you keep hotel?  If I had known it, I would have put up with you, but my bill is paid  in advance at my hotel until Saturday. If you can give me a good room  by then, I'll come up and stop with you.\"    \"You can haf any room in mine house, Mr. Baughman,\" said Seigerman.    As Baugh was about to leave he once more impressed on Louie the nature  of his call. \"Now, Mr. Seigerman,\" said Baughman, using the German  language during the parting conversation, \"let me have your answer at  the earliest possible moment, for we want to begin an active canvass  at once. This is a large county, and to enlist our friends in your  behalf no time should be lost.\" With a profusion of \"Leben Sie wohls\"  and well wishes for each other, the \"Zweibund\" parted.    Stubb and Arab were waiting on a corner for Baugh. When he returned he  withheld his report until they had retreated to the privacy of their  own room. Once secure, he said to both: \"If you would like to know  what an active, resourceful brain is, put your ear to my head,\"  tapping his temple with his finger, \"and listen to mine throb and  purr. Everything is working like silk. I'm going around to board with  him Saturday. I want you to go over with me to-morrow, Stubby, and  give him a big game about what a general uprising there is amongst  the cowmen for an efficient man for the office of sheriff, and make it  strong. I gave him my last whirl to-day in German. Oh, he'll run all  right; and we want to convey the impression that we can rally the  cattle interests to his support. Put up a good grievance, mind you!  You can both know that I begged strong when I took this cigar in  preference to a drink.\"    \"It's certainly a bad state of affairs we've come to when you refuse  whiskey. Don't you think so, Stubby?\" said Arab, addressing the one  and appealing to the other. \"You never refused no drink, Baugh, you  know you didn't,\" said Stubb reproachfully.    \"Oh, you little sawed-off burnt-offering, you can't see the policy  that we must use in handling this matter. This is a delicate play,  that can't be managed roughshod on horseback. It has food, shelter,  and drink in it for us all, but they must be kept in the background.  The main play now is to convince Mr. Seigerman that he has a call to  serve his country in the office of sheriff. Bear down heavy on the  emergency clause. Then make him think that no other name but Louie  Seigerman will satisfy the public clamor. Now, my dear Stubby, I know  that you are a gifted and accomplished liar, and for that reason I  insist that you work your brain and tongue in this matter. Keep your  own motive in the background and bring his to the front. That's the  idea. Now, can you play your part?\"    \"Well, as I have until to-morrow to think it over, I'll try,\" said  Stubb.    The next afternoon Baugh and Stubb sauntered into Louie's place, and  received a very cordial welcome at the hands of the proprietor. Baugh  introduced Stubb as a friend of his whom he had met in town that day,  and who, being also interested in cattle, he thought might be able to  offer some practical suggestions. Their polite refusal to indulge in a  social glass with the proprietor almost hurt his feelings.    \"Let us retire to the rear room for a few moments of conversation, if  you have the leisure,\" said Baugh.    Once secure in the back room, Stubb opened his talk. \"As my friend  Mr. Baughman has said, I'm local manager of the Ohio Cattle Company  operating in the Strip. I'm spending considerable time in your town at  present, as I'm overseeing the wintering of something like a hundred  saddle horses and two hundred and fifty of our thoroughbred bulls.  We worked our saddle stock so late last fall, that on my advice the  superintendent sent them into the State to be corn-fed for the winter.  The bulls were too valuable to be risked on the range. We had over  fifty stolen last season, that cost us over three hundred dollars a  head. I had a letter this morning from our superintendent, asking me  to unite with what seems to be a general movement to suppress this  high-handed stealing that has run riot in this county in the past.  Mr. Baughman has probably acquainted you with the general sentiment  in cattle circles regarding what should be done. I wish to assure  you further that my people stand ready to use their best endeavors  to nominate a candidate who will pledge himself to stamp out this  disgraceful brand-burning and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12288"],[0,"The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut (1647-1697) (#5)"],[1,"er, in his _Articles of Visitation_ in  1549, enjoined the clergy to inquire as to any craft invented by the  Devil; and Bishop Jewell, preaching before the queen in 1558, said:    \"It may please your Grace to understand that witches and sorcerers  within these last few years are marvelously increased within your  Grace's realm, Your Grace's subjects pine away even unto the death,  their colour fadeth, their flesh rotteth, their speech is benumbed,  their senses are bereft.\"    The act of 1541 was amended in Queen Elizabeth's reign, in 1562, but at  the accession of James I--himself a fanatic and bigot in religious  matters, and the author of the famous _Daemonologie_--a new law was  enacted with exact definition of the crime, which remained in force more  than a hundred years. Its chief provision was this:    \"If any person or persons use, practice or exercise any invocation or  conjuration of any evil and wicked spirit, or shall consult, covenant  with, entertain, employ, feed or reward any evil and wicked spirit to or  for any intent or purpose, or take up any dead man, woman, or child out  of his, her or their grave, or any other place where the dead body  resteth or the skin, bone, or any part of any dead person, to be  employed or used in any manner of witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or  enchantment, or shall use, practise, or exercise any witchcraft,  enchantment, charm, or sorcery, whereby any person shall be killed,  destroyed, wasted, consumed, pined or lamed in his or her body or any  part thereof: every such offender is a felon without benefit of clergy.\"    Under this law, and the methods of its administration, witchcraft so  called increased; persecutions multiplied, especially under the  Commonwealth, and notably in the eastern counties of England, whence so  many of all estates, all sorts and conditions of men, had fled over seas  to set up the standard of independence in the Puritan colonies.    Many executions occurred in Lancashire, in Suffolk, Essex, and  Huntingdonshire, where the infamous scoundrel \"Witch-finder-General\"  Matthew Hopkins, under the sanction of the courts, was \"pricking,\"  \"waking,\" \"watching,\" and \"testing\" persons suspected or accused of  witchcraft, with fiendish ingenuity of indignity and torture. Says James  Howell in his _Familiar Letters_, in 1646:    \"We have multitudes of witches among us; for in Essex and Suffolk there  were above two hundred indicted within these two years, and above the  half of them executed.\"    \"Within the compass of two years (1645-7), near upon three hundred  witches were arraigned, and the major part of them executed in Essex and  Suffolk only. Scotland swarms with them more and more, and persons of  good quality are executed daily.\"    Scotland set its seal on witchcraft as a crime by an act of its  parliament so early as 1563, amended in 1649. The ministers were the  inquisitors and persecutors. They heard the confessions, and inflicted  the tortures, and their cruelties were commensurate with the hard and  fast theology that froze the blood of mercy in their veins.    The trials were often held by special commissions issued by the privy  council, on the petition of a presbytery or general assembly. It was  here that those terrible instruments of torture, the caschielawis, the  lang irnis, the boot and the pilliewinkis, were used to wring  confessions from the wretched victims. It is all a strange and gruesome  story of horrors told in detail in the state trial records, and  elsewhere, from the execution of Janet Douglas--Lady Glammis--to that of  the poor old woman at Dornoch who warmed herself at the fire set for her  burning. So firmly seated in the Scotch mind was the belief in  witchcraft as a sin and crime, that when the laws against it were  repealed in 1736, Scotchmen in the highest stations of church and state  remonstrated against the repeal as contrary to the law of God; and  William Forbes, in his \"Institutes of the Law of Scotland,\" calls  witchcraft \"that black art whereby strange and wonderful things are  wrought by a power derived from the devil.\"    This glance at what transpired on the continent and in England and  Scotland is of value, in the light it throws on the beliefs and  convictions of both Pilgrim and Puritan--Englishmen all--in their new  domain, their implicit reliance on established precedents, their  credulity in witchcraft matters, and their absolute trust in scriptural  and secular authority for their judicial procedure, and the execution of  the grim sentences of the courts, until the revolting work of the  accuser and the searcher, and the delusion of the ministers and  magistrates aflame with mistaken zeal vanished in the sober  afterthought, the reaction of the public mind and conscience, which at  last crushed the machinations of the Devil and his votaries in high  places.          CHAPTER IV    \"Hence among all the superstitions that have 'stood over' from primeval  ages, the belief in witchcraft has been the most deeply rooted and the  most tenacious of life. In all times and places until quite lately,  among the most advanced communities, the reality of witchcraft has been  accepted without question, and scarcely any human belief is supported by  so vast a quantity of recorded testimony.\"    \"Considering the fact that the exodus of Puritans to New England  occurred during the reign of Charles I, while the persecutions for  witchcraft were increasing toward a maximum in the mother country, it is  rather strange that so few cases occurred in the New World.\" _New France  and New England_ (pp. 136-144), FISKE.      The forefathers believed in witchcraft--entering into compacts with the  Devil--and in all its diabolical subtleties. They had cogent reasons for  their belief in example and experience. They set it down in their codes  as a capital offense. They found, as has been shown abundant authority  in the Bible and in the English precedents. They anchored their criminal  codes as they did their theology in the wide and deep haven of the Old  Testament decrees and prophecies and maledictions, and doubted not that  \"the Scriptures do hold forth a perfect rule for the direction and  government of all men in all duties which they are to perform to God and  men.\"    Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Haven, early in their history  enacted these capital laws:    In Massachusetts (1641):    \"Witchcraft which is fellowship by covenant with a familiar spirit to  be punished with death.\"    \"Consulters with witches not to be tolerated, but either to be cut off  by death or banishment or other suitable punishment.\" (_Abstract New  England Laws_, 1655.)    In Connecticut (1642):    \"If any man or woman be a witch--that is, hath or consulteth with a  familiar spirit--they shall be put to death.\" Exodus xxii, 18; Leviticus  xx, 27; Deuteronomy xviii, 10, 11. (_Colonial Records of Connecticut_,  Vol. I, p. 77).    In New Haven (1655):    \"If any person be a witch, he or she shall be put to death according to\"  Exodus xxii, 18; Leviticus xx, 27; Deuteronomy xviii, 10, 11. (_New  Haven Colonial Records_, Vol. II, p. 576, Cod. 1655).    These laws were authoritative until the epidemic had ceased.    Witches were tried, condemned, and executed with no question as to due  legal power, in the minds of juries, counsel, and courts, until the hour  of reaction came, hastened by doubts and criticisms of the sources and  character of evidence, and the magistrates and clergy halted in their  prosecutions and denunciations of an alleged crime born of delusion, and  nurtured by a theology run rampant.    \"They had not been taught to question the wisdom or the humanity of  English criminal law.\" (_Blue Laws--True and False_, p. 15, TRUMBULL.)    Here and there in New England, following the great immigration from Old  England, from 1630-40, during the Commonwealth, and to the Restoration,  several cases of witchcraft occurred, but the mania did not set its  seal on the minds of men, and inspire them to run amuck in their frenzy,  until the days of the swift onset in Massachusetts and Connecticut in  1692, when the zenith of Satan's reign was reached in the Puritan  colonies.    A few words about the tragedy at Salem are relevant and essential. They  are written because it was the last outbreak of epidemic demonopathy  among the civilized peoples; it has been exploited by writers abroad,  who have left the dreadful record of the treatment of the delusion in  their own countries in the background; it was accompanied in some degree  by like manifestations and methods of suppression in sister colonies; it  was fanned into flames by men in high station who reveled in its  merciless extirpation as a religious duty, and eased their consciences  afterwards by contrition, confession and remorse, for their valiant  service in the army of the theological devil; and especially for the  contrasts it presents to the more cautious and saner methods of  procedure that obtained in the governments of Connecticut and New Haven  at the apogee of the delusion.    What say the historians and scholars, some of whose ancestors witnessed  or participated in the tragedies, and whose acquaintance with the facts  defies all challenge?    \"It is on the whole the most gruesome episode in American history, and  it sheds back a lurid light upon the long tale of witchcraft in the  past.\" (_Fiske's New France and New England_, 195.)    \"The sainted minister in the church; the woman of the scarlet letter in  the market place! What imagination would have been irreverent enough to  surmise that the same scorching stigma was on them both.\" (_Scarlet  Letter_, HAWTHORNE.)    \"We are made partners in parish and village feuds. We share in the  chimney corner gossip, and learn for the first time how many mean and  merely human motives, whether consciously or unconsciously, gave impulse  and intensity to the passions of the actors in that memorable tragedy  which dealt"]]]
