SING A SONG OF SIXPENCE    Sing a song of sixpence,     A pocket full of rye;  Four-and-twenty blackbirds     Baked in a pie!    When the pie was opened     The birds began to sing;  Was not that a dainty dish     To set before the king?    The king was in his counting-house,     Counting out his money;  The queen was in the parlor,     Eating bread and honey.    The maid was in the garden,     Hanging out the clothes;  When down came a blackbird     And snapped off her nose.

THE DERBY RAM    As I was going to Derby all on a market-day,  I met the finest ram, sir, that ever was fed upon hay;    Upon hay, upon hay, upon hay;  I met the finest ram, sir, that ever was fed upon hay.  This ram was fat behind, sir; this ram was fat before;  This ram was ten yards round, sir; indeed, he was no more;    No more, no more, no more;  This ram was ten yards round, sir; indeed, he was no more.  The horns that grew on his head, sir, they were so wondrous high,  As I've been plainly told, sir, they reached up to the sky.    The sky, the sky, the sky;  As I've been plainly told, sir, they reached up to the sky.  The tail that grew from his back, sir, was six yards and an ell;  And it was sent to Derby to toll the market bell;    The bell, the bell, the bell;  And it was sent to Derby to toll the market bell.

BOY AND THE SPARROW    A little cock-sparrow sat on a green tree,  And he chirruped, he chirruped, so merry was he;  A naughty boy came with his wee bow and arrow,  Determined to shoot this little cock-sparrow.    \"This little cock-sparrow shall make me a stew,  And his giblets shall make me a little pie, too.\"  \"Oh, no,\" says the sparrow \"I won't make a stew.\"  So he flapped his wings and away he flew.      OLD WOMAN, OLD WOMAN    There was an old woman tossed in a basket,    Seventeen times as high as the moon;  But where she was going no mortal could tell,    For under her arm she carried a broom.    \"Old woman, old woman, old woman,\" said I,    \"Whither, oh whither, oh whither so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10611"],[0,"An Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species, Particularly the (#5)"],[1,"same custom prevailed among the people of the West; for as  the Helots became the slaves of the Spartans, from the right of conquest  only, so prisoners of war were reduced to the same situation by the rest  of the inhabitants of Greece. By the same principles that actuated  these, were the Romans also influenced. Their History will confirm the  fact: for how many cities are recorded to have been taken; how many  armies to have been vanquished in the field, and the wretched survivors,  in both instances, to have been doomed to servitude? It remains only now  to observe, in shewing this custom to have been universal, that all  those nations which assisted in overturning the Roman Empire, though  many and various, adopted the same measures; for we find it a general  maxim in their polity, that whoever should fall into their hands as a  prisoner of war, should immediately be reduced to the condition of a  slave.    It may here, perhaps, be not unworthy of remark, that the  _involuntary_ were of greater antiquity than the _voluntary_  slaves. The latter are first mentioned in the time of Pharaoh: they  could have arisen only in a state of society; when property, after its  division, had become so unequal, as to multiply the wants of  individuals; and when government, after its establishment, had given  security to the possessor by the punishment of crimes. Whereas the  former seem to be dated with more propriety from the days of Nimrod; who  gave rise probably to that inseparable idea of _victory_ and  _servitude_, which we find among the nations of antiquity, and  which has existed uniformly since, in one country or another, to the  present day.[008]    Add to this, that they might have arisen even in a state of nature, and  have been coequal with the quarrels of mankind.             *        *        *        *        *    FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 007: \"Nomos en pasin anthropois aidios esin, otan polemounton  polis alo, ton elonton einai kai ta somata ton en te poleis, kai ta  chremata.\" Xenoph.

III.    But it was not victory alone, or any presupposed right, founded in the  damages of war, that afforded a pretence for invading the liberties of  mankind: the honourable light, in which _piracy_ was considered in  the uncivilized ages of the world, contributed not a little to the  _slavery_ of the human species. Piracy had a very early beginning.  \"The Grecians,\"[009] says Thucydides, \"in their primitive state, as well  as the contemporary barbarians, who inhabited the sea coasts and  islands, gave themselves wholly to it; it was, in short, their only  profession and support.\" The writings of Homer are sufficient of  themselves to establish this account. They shew it to have been a common  practice at so early a period as that of the Trojan war; and abound with  many lively descriptions of it; which, had they been as groundless as  they are beautiful, would have frequently spared the sigh of the reader  of sensibility and reflection.    The piracies, which were thus practised in the early ages, may be  considered as _publick_ or _private_. In the former, whole  crews embarked for the benefit[010] of their respective tribes. They  made descents on the sea coasts, carried off cattle, surprized whole  villages, put many of the inhabitants to the sword, and carried others  into slavery.    In the latter, individuals only were concerned, and the emolument was  their own. These landed from their ships, and, going up into the  country, concealed themselves in the woods and thickets; where they  waited every opportunity of catching the unfortunate shepherd or  husbandman alone. In this situation they sallied out upon him, dragged  him on board, conveyed him to a foreign market, and sold him for a  slave.    To this kind of piracy Ulysses alludes, in opposition to the former,  which he had been just before mentioning, in his question to Eumoeus.      \"Did pirates wait, till all thy friends were gone,  To catch thee singly with thy flocks alone;  Say, did they force thee from thy fleecy care,  And from thy fields transport and sell thee here?\"[011]      But no picture, perhaps, of this mode of depredation, is equal to that,  with which[012] Xenophon presents us in the simple narrative of a dance.  He informs us that the Grecian army had concluded a peace with the  Paphlagonians, and that they entertained their embassadors in  consequence with a banquet, and the exhibition of various feats of  activity. \"When the Thracians,\" says he, \"had performed the parts  allotted them in this entertainment, some Aenianian and Magnetian  soldiers rose up, and, accoutred in their proper arms, exhibited that  dance, which is called _Karpoea_. The figure of it is thus. One of  them, in the character of an husbandman, is seen to till his land, and  is observed, as he drives his plough, to look frequently behind him, as  if apprehensive of danger. Another immediately appears in fight, in  the character of a robber. The husbandman, having seen him previously  advancing, snatches up his arms. A battle ensues before the plough. The  whole of this performance is kept in perfect time with the musick of the  flute. At length the robber, having got the better of the husbandman,  binds him, and drives him off with his team. Sometimes it happens that  the husbandman subdues the robber: in this case the scene is only  reversed, as the latter is then bound and driven, off by the former.\"    It is scarcely necessary to observe, that this dance was a  representation of the general manners of men, in the more uncivilized  ages of the world; shewing that the husbandman and shepherd lived in  continual alarm, and that there were people in those ages, who derived  their pleasures and fortunes from _kidnapping_ and _enslaving_  their fellow creatures.    We may now take notice of a circumstance in this narration, which will  lead us to a review of our first assertion on this point, \"that the  honourable light, in which _piracy_ was considered in the times of  barbarism, contributed not a little to the _slavery_ of the human  species.\" The robber is represented here as frequently defeated in his  attempts, and as reduced to that deplorable situation, to which he was  endeavouring to bring another. This shews the frequent difficulty and  danger of his undertakings: people would not tamely resign their lives  or liberties, without a struggle. They were sometimes prepared; were  superior often, in many points of view, to these invaders of their  liberty; there were an hundred accidental circumstances frequently in  their favour. These adventures therefore required all the skill,  strength, agility, valour, and every thing, in short, that may be  supposed to constitute heroism, to conduct them with success. Upon this  idea piratical expeditions first came into repute, and their frequency  afterwards, together with the danger and fortitude, that were  inseparably connected with them, brought them into such credit among the  barbarous nations of antiquity, that of all human professions, piracy  was the most honourable.[013]    The notions then, which were thus annexed to piratical expeditions, did  not fail to produce those consequences, which we have mentioned before.  They afforded an opportunity to the views of avarice and ambition, to  conceal themselves under the mask of virtue. They excited a spirit of  enterprize, of all others the most irresistible, as it subsisted on the  strongest principles of action, emolument and honour. Thus could the  vilest of passions be gratified with impunity. People were robbed,  stolen, murdered, under the pretended idea that these were reputable  adventures: every enormity in short was committed, and dressed up in the  habiliments of honour.    But as the notions of men in the less barbarous ages, which followed,  became more corrected and refined, the practice of piracy began  gradually to disappear. It had hitherto been supported on the grand  columns of _emolument_ and _honour_. When the latter therefore  was removed, it received a considerable shock; but, alas! it had still a  pillar for its support! _avarice_, which exists in all states, and  which is ready to turn every invention to its own ends, strained hard  for its preservation. It had been produced in the ages of barbarism; it  had been pointed out in those ages as lucrative, and under this notion  it was continued. People were still stolen; many were intercepted (some,  in their pursuits of pleasure, others, in the discharge of their several  occupations) by their own countrymen; who previously laid in wait for  them, and sold them afterwards for slaves; while others seized by  merchants, who traded on the different coasts, were torn from their  friends and connections, and carried into slavery. The merchants of  Thessaly, if we can credit Aristophanes[014] who never spared the vices  of the times, were particularly infamous for the latter kind of  depredation; the Athenians were notorious for the former; for they had  practised these robberies to such an alarming degree of danger to  individuals, that it was found necessary to enact a law[015], which  punished kidnappers with death.--But this is sufficient for our present  purpose; it will enable us to assert, that there were two classes of  _involuntary_ slaves among the ancients, \"of those who were taken  publickly in a state of war, and of those who were privately stolen in  a state of innocence and peace.\" We may now add, that the children and  descendents of these composed a third.             *        *        *        *        *      FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 009: Thucydides.
