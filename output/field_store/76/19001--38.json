In  Hadley the guard was allowed annually from the public treasury a pound of  lead and a pound of powder to each soldier.    No details that could add to safety on the Sabbath were forgotten or  overlooked by the New Haven church; bullets were made common currency at  the value of a farthing, in order that they might be plentiful and in every  one's possession; the colonists were enjoined to determine in advance what  to do with the women and children in case of attack, \"that they do not hang  about them and hinder them;\" the men were ordered to bring at least six  charges of powder and shot to meeting; the farmers were forbidden to \"leave  more arms at home than men to use them;\" the half-pikes were to be headed  and the whole ones mended, and the swords \"and all piercing weapons  furbished up and dressed;\" wood was to be placed in the watch-house; it was  ordered that the \"door of the meeting-house next the soldiers' seat be kept  clear from women and children sitting there, that if there be occasion  for the soldiers to go suddenly forth, they may have free passage.\" The  soldiers sat on either side of the main door, a sentinel was stationed  in the meeting-house turret, and armed watchers paced the streets; three  cannon were mounted by the side of this \"church militant,\" which must  strongly have resembled a garrison.    Military duty and military discipline and regard for the Sabbath, and for  the House of God as well, did not always make the well-equipped occupants  of these soldiers' seats in New Haven behave with the dignity and decorum  befitting such guardians of the peace and protectors in war. Serious  disorders and disturbances among the guard were reported at the General  Court on June 16, 1662. One belligerent son of Mars, as he sat in the  meeting-house, threw lumps of lime--perhaps from the plastered chinks in  the log wall--at a fellow-warrior, who in turn, very naturally, kicked his  tormentor with much agility and force. There must have ensued quite a free  fight all around in the meeting-house, for \"Mrs. Goodyear's boy had his  head broke that day in meeting, on account of which a woman said she  doubted not the wrath of God was upon us.\" And well might she think so, for  divers other unseemly incidents which occurred in the meeting-house at the  same time were narrated in Court, examined into, and punished.    In spite of these events in the New Haven church (which were certainly  exceptional), the seemingly incongruous union of church and army was  suitable enough in a community that always began and ended the military  exercises on \"training day\" with solemn prayer and psalm-singing; and that  used the army and encouraged a true soldier-like spirit not chiefly as aids  in war, but to help to conquer and destroy the adversaries of truth, and to  \"achieve greater matters by this little handful of men than the world is  aware of.\"    The Salem sentinels wore doubtless some of the good English armor owned by  the town,--corselets to cover the body; gorgets to guard the throat;  tasses to protect the thighs; all varnished black, and costing each suit  \"twenty-four shillings a peece.\" The sentry also wore a bandileer, a large  \"neat's leather\" belt thrown over the right shoulder, and hanging down  under the left arm. This bandileer sustained twelve boxes of cartridges,  and a well-filled bullet-bag. Each man bore either a \"bastard musket with  a snaphance,\" a \"long fowling-piece with musket bore,\" a \"full musket,\" a  \"barrell with a match-cock,\" or perhaps (for they were purchased by the  town) a leather gun (though these leather guns may have been cannon).  Other weapons there were to choose from, mysterious in name, \"sakers,  minions, ffaulcons, rabinets, murthers (or murderers, as they were  sometimes appropriately called) chambers, harque-busses, carbins,\"--all  these and many other death-dealing machines did our forefathers bring and  import from their war-loving fatherland to assist them in establishing  God's Word, and exterminating the Indians, but not always, alas! to aid  them in converting those poor heathen.    The armed Salem watcher, besides his firearms and ammunition, had attached  to his wrist by a cord a gun-rest, or gun-fork, which he placed upon  the ground when he wished to fire his musket, and upon which that  constitutional kicker rested when touched off. He also carried a sword and  sometimes a pike, and thus heavily burdened with multitudinous arms and  cumbersome armor, could never have run after or from an Indian with much  agility or celerity; though he could stand at the church-door with his  leather gun,--an awe-inspiring figure,--and he could shoot with his  \"harquebuss,\" or \"carbin,\" as we well know.    These armed \"sentinells\" are always regarded as a most picturesque  accompaniment of Puritan religious worship, and the Salem and Plymouth  armed men were imposing, though clumsy. But the New Haven soldiers, with  their bulky garments wadded and stuffed out with thick layers of cotton  wool, must have been more safety-assuring and comforting than they were  romantic or heroic; but perhaps they too wore painted tin armor, \"corselets  and gorgets and tasses.\"    In Concord, New Hampshire, the men, who all came armed to meeting, stacked  their muskets around a post in the middle of the church, while the honored  pastor, who was a good shot and owned the best gun in the settlement,  preached with his treasured weapon in the pulpit by his side, ready from  his post of vantage to blaze away at any red man whom he saw sneaking  without, or to lead, if necessary, his congregation to battle. The church  in York, Maine, until the year 1746, felt it necessary to retain the custom  of carrying arms to the meeting-house, so plentiful and so aggressive were  Maine Indians.    Not only in the time of Indian wars were armed men seen in the  meeting-house, but on June 17, 1775, the Provincial Congress recommended  that the men \"within twenty miles of the sea-coast carry their arms and  ammunition with them to meeting on the Sabbath and other days when they  meet for public worship.\" And on many a Sabbath and Lecture Day, during the  years of war that followed, were proved the wisdom and foresight of that  suggestion.    The men in those old days of the seventeenth century, when in constant  dread of attacks by Indians, always rose when the services were ended and  left the house before the women and children, thus making sure the safe  exit of the latter. This custom prevailed from habit until a late date in  many churches in New England, all the men, after the benediction and the  exit of the parson, walking out in advance of the women. So also the custom  of the men always sitting at the \"head\" or door of the pew arose from the  early necessity of their always being ready to seize their arms and rush  unobstructed to fight. In some New England village churches to this day,  the man who would move down from his end of the pew and let a woman sit  at the door, even if it were a more desirable seat from which to see the  clergyman, would be thought a poor sort of a creature.          III.    By Drum and Horn and Shell.        At about nine o'clock on the Sabbath morning the Puritan colonists  assembled for the first public service of the holy day; they were gathered  together by various warning sounds. The Haverhill settlers listened for the  ringing toot of Abraham Tyler's horn. The Montague and South Hadley people  were notified that the hour of assembling had arrived by the loud blowing  of a conch-shell. John Lane, a resident of the latter town, was engaged  in 1750 to \"blow the Cunk\" on the Sabbath as \"a sign for meeting.\" In  Stockbridge a strong-lunged \"praying\" Indian blew the enormous shell, which  was safely preserved until modern times, and which, when relieved from  Sunday use, was for many years sounded as a week-day signal in the  hay-field. Even a conch-shell was enough of an expense to the poor colonial  churches. The Montague people in 1759 paid L1 10s. for their \"conk,\" and  also on the purchase year gave Joseph Root 20 shillings for blowing the new  shell. In 1785 the Whately church voted that \"we will not improve anybody  to blow the conch,\" and so the church-attendants straggled to Whately  meeting each at his own time and pleasure.    In East Hadley the inhabitant who \"blew the kunk\" (as phonetic East  Hadleyites spelt it) and swept out the meeting-house was paid annually the  munificent sum of three dollars for his services. Conch-blowing was not  so difficult and consequently not so highly-paid an accomplishment as  drum-beating. A verse of a simple old-fashioned hymn tells thus of the  gathering of the Puritan saints:--      \"New England's Sabbath day    Is heaven-like still and pure,    When Israel walks the way    Up to the temple's door.    The time we tell    When there to come    By beat of drum    Or sounding shell.\"    The drum, as highly suitable for such a military people, was often used as  a signal for gathering for public worship, and was plainly the favorite  means of notification. In 1678 Robert Stuard, of Norwalk, \"ingages yt his  son James shall beate the Drumb, on the Sabbath and other ocations,\" and in  Norwalk the \"drumb,\" the \"drumne,\" the \"drumme,\" and at last the drum was  beaten until 1704, when the Church got a bell. And the \"Drumber\" was paid,  and well paid too for his \"Cervices,\" fourteen shillings a year of the  town's money, and he was furnished a \"new strong drumme;\" and the town  supplied to him also the flax for the drum-cords which he wore out in the  service of God. Johnson, in his \"Wonder Working Providence,\" tells of the  Cambridge Church: \"Hearing the sound of a drum he was directed toward it by  a broade beaten way; following this rode he demands of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8675"],[0,"Welsh Fairy-Tales and Other Stories (#4)"],[1,"black crows, a son shall be born in the family.    Four black crows, a daughter shall be born in the family.    Five black crows shall be a funeral in the family.    Six black crows, if they fly head on, a sudden death.    Seven black crows with their tails towards you, death within seven    years.      There was a young man, not so very long ago, who had been to sea for  years. He was married, but had no children. He was one of the most  spirited men you ever saw. He used to complain of his dreams. He said,  \"All at once last Sunday I was up in the air, and I saw the vessel I was  in going at great speed, making for a mountain, and I tried as hard as  I could to keep her from the mountain. I don't believe I was asleep  at all, I could see it so plainly. I went along in the air, looking at  seven black crows all the time. I got dizzy, and the vessel seemed to  lower on to the earth. The vessel lowered within a few hundred feet of  the earth, and I saw what I thought were fairies. I thought I had been  there for days; in truth, it seemed to me I had been up there for three  days, and that I could hear the fairies with mournful sounds drawing  a coffin. I watched and watched, and saw seven crows on the coffin.  It seemed as if they were going to bury someone. Whilst the coffin  was going the seven crows flew up and bursted, and the heavens were  illuminated more strongly than by the sun. Then I lost sight of the  fairies, but saw some big giants in white walking about, and there was  a big throne with a roof to it. And all at once I was in total darkness,  but I could hear things flapping about, flying through the air. Then I  saw the moon rising and all the stars, and all sorts of objects flying  through the air. And one came to me, and put his hand upon my shoulder,  saying: _'Prepare to meet us to-morrow.'_ After that everything went  dark again. The first thing I knew I was in a ship steering, and the  seven black crows were in front of me. I had a great trouble to steer my  vessel. And as I went on the vessel struck a steeple, and exploded, and  I awoke. Whereupon I jumped out of bed, looking very pale.\"    I left him on the beach at 11.30, after he told me this, when he went  home. When he got home he could see seven black crows on the house.  Other people could see the crows, but could not count them. He saw them  all perched head on. He went into the house, and said,    \"There is something in these crows, Jane; see them on the roof.\"    She cried out and ran out and looked, but could not see the seven. After  that he didn't seem to be himself, though there was nothing the matter  with him. A week afterwards, I went out on the Sunday morning after  breakfast, and there was a seat on the beach, and on it sat this man,  Johnny, and another man.    \"Why, Johnny, you look very pale,\" I said.    \"Do I?\" he said.    \"Yes! indeed you do,\" I replied.    \"Well, I don't know, I have had such dreams.\"    \"What will they have been, then?\" I asked.    \"That I was in a full-rigged ship, with all sails set; I was all alone,  but could see nothing, only seven black crows. I counted them, but my  wife could see nothing, but she could hear something.\"    That same day, when he went home, he said to his wife:    \"Ah, Jane, there is something coming over me,\" and he fell down dead.          ROBERT ROBERTS AND THE FAIRIES.    Robert Roberts was a carpenter who worked hard and well; but he could  never keep his tongue still. One day, as he was crossing a brook, a  little man came up to him and said:    \"Robert Roberts, go up to the holly tree that leans over the road on the  Red-hill, and dig below it, and you shall be rewarded.\"    The very next morning, at daybreak, Robert Roberts set out for the spot,  and dug a great hole, before anyone was up, when he found a box of gold.  He went to the same place twice afterwards, and dug, and found gold  each time. But as he grew rich, he began to boast and hint that he had  mysterious friends. One day, when the talk turned on the fairies, he  said that he knew them right well, and that they gave him money. Robert  Roberts thought no more of the matter until he went to the spot a week  afterwards, one evening at dusk. When he got to the tree, and began to  dig as usual, big stones came rolling down the bank, just missing him,  so that he ran for his life, and never went near the place again.          THE FAIRY OF THE DELL.    In olden times fairies were sent to oppose the evil-doings of witches,  and to destroy their power. About three hundred years ago a band of  fairies, sixty in number, with their queen, called Queen of the Dell,  came to Mona to oppose the evil works of a celebrated witch. The fairies  settled by a spring, in a valley. After having blessed the spring, or  \"well\", as they called it, they built a bower just above the spring for  the queen, placing a throne therein. Near by they built a large bower  for themselves to live in.    After that, the queen drew three circles, one within the other, on a  nice flat grassy place by the well. When they were comfortably settled,  the queen sent the fairies about the country to gather tidings of  the people. They went from house to house, and everywhere heard great  complaints against an old witch; how she had made some blind, others  lame, and deformed others by causing a horn to grow out of their  foreheads. When they got back to the well and told the queen, she said:    \"I must do something for these old people, and though the witch is very  powerful, we must break her power.\" So the next day the queen fairy sent  word to all the bewitched to congregate upon a fixed day at the sacred  well, just before noon.    When the day came, several ailing people collected at the well. The  queen then placed the patients in pairs in the inner ring, and the sixty  fairies in pairs in the middle ring. Each little fairy was three feet  and a half high, and carried a small wand in her right hand, and a bunch  of fairy flowers--cuckoo's boots, baby's bells, and day's-eyes--in her  left hand. Then the queen, who was four feet and a half in height, took  the outside ring. On her head was a crown of wild flowers, in her right  hand she carried a wand, and in her left a posy of fairy flowers. At a  signal from the queen they began marching round the rings, singing in  chorus:      \"We march round by two and two    The circles of the sacred well    That lies in the dell.\"    When they had walked twice round the ring singing, the queen took her  seat upon the throne, and calling each patient to her, she touched him  with her wand and bade him go down to the sacred well and dip his body  into the water three times, promising that all his ills should be cured.  As each one came forth from the spring he knelt before the queen, and  she blessed him, and told him to hurry home and put on dry clothes. So  that all were cured of their ills.        II.    Now the old witch who had worked all these evils lived near the well  in a cottage. She had first learned witchcraft from a book called _The  Black Art_, which a gentleman farmer had lent her when a girl. She  progressed rapidly with her studies, and being eager to learn more, sold  herself to the devil, who made compact with her that she should have  full power for seven years, after which she was to become his. He gave  her a wand that had the magic power of drawing people to her, and she  had a ring on the grass by her house just like the fairy's ring. As the  seven years were drawing to a close, and her heart was savage against  the farmer who first led her into the paths of evil knowledge, she  determined to be revenged. One day, soon after the Fairy of the Dell  came to live by the spring, she drew the farmer to her with her wand,  and, standing in her ring, she lured him into it. When he crossed the  line, she said:      \"Cursed be he or she    That crosses my circle to see me,\"    and, touching him on the head and back, a horn and a tail grew from  the spots touched. He went off in a terrible rage, but she only laughed  maliciously. Then, as she heard of the Queen of the Dell's good deeds,  she repented of her evil deeds, and begged her neighbour to go to the  queen fairy and ask her if she might come and visit her. The queen  consented, and the old witch went down and told her everything--of the  book, of the magic wand, of the ring, and of all the wicked deeds she  had done.    \"O, you have been a bad witch,\" said the queen, \"but I will see what I  can do; but you must bring me the book and the wand;\" and she told the  old witch to come on the following day a little before noon. When the  witch came the next day with her wand and book, she found the fairies  had built a fire in the middle ring. The queen then took her and stood  her by the fire, for she could not trust her on the outer circle.    \"Now I must have more power,\" said the queen to the fairies, and she  went and sat on the throne, leaving the witch by the fire in the middle  ring. After thinking a little, the queen said, \"Now I have it,\" and  coming down from her throne muttering, she began walking round the outer  circle, waiting for the hour of one o'clock, when all the fairies got  into the middle circle and marched round, singing:      \"At the hour of one    The cock shall crow one,    Goo! Goo! Goo!    I am here to tell    Of the sacred well    That lies in the dell,    And will conquer hell.\"    On the second round, they sang:      \"At the hour of two    The cock crows two,    Goo! Goo! Goo!    I am here to tell    Of the sacred well    That lies in the dell;    We will conquer hell.\"    At the last round, they sang:      \"At the hour of three    The cock crows three,    Goo! Goo! Goo!    I am here to tell    Of the sacred well    That lies in the dell;    Now I have conquered hell.\"    Then the queen cast the book and wand into the fire, and immediately  the vale was rent by a thundering noise, and numbers of devils came"]]]
