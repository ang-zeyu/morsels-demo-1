Nor nature only there lavish'd her hues,  But of the sweetness of a thousand smells  A rare and undistinguish'd fragrance made.    \"Salve Regina,\" on the grass and flowers  Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit  Who not beyond the valley could be seen.    \"Before the west'ring sun sink to his bed,\"  Began the Mantuan, who our steps had turn'd,    \"'Mid those desires not that I lead ye on.  For from this eminence ye shall discern  Better the acts and visages of all,  Than in the nether vale among them mix'd.  He, who sits high above the rest, and seems  To have neglected that he should have done,  And to the others' song moves not his lip,  The Emperor Rodolph call, who might have heal'd  The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died,  So that by others she revives but slowly,  He, who with kindly visage comforts him,  Sway'd in that country, where the water springs,  That Moldaw's river to the Elbe, and Elbe  Rolls to the ocean: Ottocar his name:  Who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth  Than Winceslaus his son, a bearded man,  Pamper'd with rank luxuriousness and ease.  And that one with the nose depress, who close  In counsel seems with him of gentle look,  Flying expir'd, with'ring the lily's flower.  Look there how he doth knock against his breast!  The other ye behold, who for his cheek  Makes of one hand a couch, with frequent sighs.  They are the father and the father-in-law  Of Gallia's bane: his vicious life they know  And foul; thence comes the grief that rends them thus.    \"He, so robust of limb, who measure keeps  In song, with him of feature prominent,  With ev'ry virtue bore his girdle brac'd.  And if that stripling who behinds him sits,  King after him had liv'd, his virtue then  From vessel to like vessel had been pour'd;  Which may not of the other heirs be said.  By James and Frederick his realms are held;  Neither the better heritage obtains.  Rarely into the branches of the tree  Doth human worth mount up; and so ordains  He who bestows it, that as his free gift  It may be call'd.  To Charles my words apply  No less than to his brother in the song;  Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess.  So much that plant degenerates from its seed,  As more than Beatrice and Margaret  Costanza still boasts of her valorous spouse.    \"Behold the king of simple life and plain,  Harry of England, sitting there alone:  He through his branches better issue spreads.    \"That one, who on the ground beneath the rest  Sits lowest, yet his gaze directs aloft,  Us William, that brave Marquis, for whose cause  The deed of Alexandria and his war  Makes Conferrat and Canavese weep.\"          CANTO VIII    Now was the hour that wakens fond desire  In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart,  Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell,  And pilgrim newly on his road with love  Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far,  That seems to mourn for the expiring day:  When I, no longer taking heed to hear  Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark  One risen from its seat, which with its hand  Audience implor'd. Both palms it join'd and rais'd,  Fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east,  As telling God, \"I care for naught beside.\"    \"Te Lucis Ante,\" so devoutly then  Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain,  That all my sense in ravishment was lost.  And the rest after, softly and devout,  Follow'd through all the hymn, with upward gaze  Directed to the bright supernal wheels.    Here, reader! for the truth makes thine eyes keen:  For of so subtle texture is this veil,  That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark'd.    I saw that gentle band silently next  Look up, as if in expectation held,  Pale and in lowly guise; and from on high  I saw forth issuing descend beneath  Two angels with two flame-illumin'd swords,  Broken and mutilated at their points.  Green as the tender leaves but newly born,  Their vesture was, the which by wings as green  Beaten, they drew behind them, fann'd in air.  A little over us one took his stand,  The other lighted on the' Opposing hill,  So that the troop were in the midst contain'd.    Well I descried the whiteness on their heads;  But in their visages the dazzled eye  Was lost, as faculty that by too much  Is overpower'd.  \"From Mary's bosom both  Are come,\" exclaim'd Sordello, \"as a guard  Over the vale, ganst him, who hither tends,  The serpent.\"  Whence, not knowing by which path  He came, I turn'd me round, and closely press'd,  All frozen, to my leader's trusted side.    Sordello paus'd not: \"To the valley now  (For it is time) let us descend; and hold  Converse with those great shadows: haply much  Their sight may please ye.\"  Only three steps down  Methinks I measur'd, ere I was beneath,  And noted one who look'd as with desire  To know me.  Time was now that air arrow dim;  Yet not so dim, that 'twixt his eyes and mine  It clear'd not up what was conceal'd before.  Mutually tow'rds each other we advanc'd.  Nino, thou courteous judge! what joy I felt,  When I perceiv'd thou wert not with the bad!    No salutation kind on either part  Was left unsaid.  He then inquir'd: \"How long  Since thou arrived'st at the mountain's foot,  Over the distant waves?\"--\"O!\" answer'd I,  \"Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,  And still in my first life, thus journeying on,  The other strive to gain.\"  Soon as they heard  My words, he and Sordello backward drew,  As suddenly amaz'd.  To Virgil one,  The other to a spirit turn'd, who near  Was seated, crying: \"Conrad! up with speed:  Come, see what of his grace high God hath will'd.\"  Then turning round to me: \"By that rare mark  Of honour which thou ow'st to him, who hides  So deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,  When thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves.  Tell my Giovanna, that for me she call  There, where reply to innocence is made.  Her mother, I believe, loves me no more;  Since she has chang'd the white and wimpled folds,  Which she is doom'd once more with grief to wish.  By her it easily may be perceiv'd,  How long in women lasts the flame of love,  If sight and touch do not relume it oft.  For her so fair a burial will not make  The viper which calls Milan to the field,  As had been made by shrill Gallura's bird.\"    He spoke, and in his visage took the stamp  Of that right seal, which with due temperature  Glows in the bosom.  My insatiate eyes  Meanwhile to heav'n had travel'd, even there  Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel  Nearest the axle; when my guide inquir'd:  \"What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?\"    I answer'd: \"The three torches, with which here  The pole is all on fire.\"  He then to me:  \"The four resplendent stars, thou saw'st this morn  Are there beneath, and these ris'n in their stead.\"    While yet he spoke.  Sordello to himself  Drew him, and cry'd: \"Lo there our enemy!\"  And with his hand pointed that way to look.    Along the side, where barrier none arose  Around the little vale, a serpent lay,  Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food.  Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake  Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;  And, as a beast that smoothes its polish'd coat,  Licking his hack.  I saw not, nor can tell,  How those celestial falcons from their seat  Mov'd, but in motion each one well descried,  Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes.  The serpent fled; and to their stations back  The angels up return'd with equal flight.    The Spirit (who to Nino, when he call'd,  Had come), from viewing me with fixed ken,  Through all that conflict, loosen'd not his sight.    \"So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high,  Find, in thy destin'd lot, of wax so much,  As may suffice thee to the enamel's height.\"  It thus began: \"If any certain news  Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part  Thou know'st, tell me, who once was mighty there  They call'd me Conrad Malaspina, not  That old one, but from him I sprang.  The love  I bore my people is now here refin'd.\"    \"In your dominions,\" I answer'd, \"ne'er was I.  But through all Europe where do those men dwell,  To whom their glory is not manifest?  The fame, that honours your illustrious house,  Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land;  So that he knows it who was never there.  I swear to you, so may my upward route  Prosper! your honour'd nation not impairs  The value of her coffer and her sword.  Nature and use give her such privilege,  That while the world is twisted from his course  By a bad head, she only walks aright,  And has the evil way in scorn.\"  He then:  \"Now pass thee on: sev'n times the tired sun  Revisits not the couch, which with four feet  The forked Aries covers, ere that kind  Opinion shall be nail'd into thy brain  With stronger nails than other's speech can drive,  If the sure course of judgment be not stay'd.\"          CANTO IX    Now the fair consort of Tithonus old,  Arisen from her mate's beloved arms,  Look'd palely o'er the eastern cliff: her brow,  Lucent with jewels, glitter'd, set in sign  Of that chill animal, who with his train  Smites fearful nations: and where then we were,  Two steps of her ascent the night had past,  And now the third was closing up its wing,  When I, who had so much of Adam with me,  Sank down upon the grass, o'ercome with sleep,  There where all five were seated.  In that hour,  When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay,  Rememb'ring haply ancient grief, renews,  And with our minds more wand'rers from the flesh,  And less by thought restrain'd are, as 't were, full  Of holy divination in their dreams,  Then in a vision did I seem to view  A golden-feather'd eagle in the sky,  With open wings, and hov'ring for descent,  And I was in that place, methought, from whence  Young Ganymede, from his associates 'reft,  Was snatch'd aloft to the high consistory.  \"Perha"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10065"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States (#5)"],[1," was the  doctrine of the English common law, as stated by Coke and three other  Chief Justices, he said:        \"To say the parliament is absolute and arbitrary is a contradiction.      The Parliament cannot make two and two five. Omnipotency cannot do      it.... Parliaments are in all cases to declare what is for the good      of the whole; but it is not the declaration of parliament that makes      it so: there must be in every instance a higher authority, viz.,      GOD. Should an Act of Parliament be against any of His natural laws,      which are immutably true, their declaration would be contrary to      eternal truth, equity and justice, and consequently void; and so it      would be adjudged by the Parliament itself, when convinced of their      mistake.\"    It is a curious fact that in the reaction from the tyranny of the  Stuarts your country abandoned this principle of the common law by  substituting for the omnipotence of the Crown the omnipotence of  Parliament, while in my country the somewhat vague and unworkable  principle of the common law, which gave the judiciary the power to  invalidate an act of the legislature, when against natural reason and  justice, was developed into the great principle, without which  institutions in an heterogeneous and widely scattered democracy would be  unworkable, namely that the powers of government are strictly defined,  and that neither the executive, the legislative, nor the judicial  departments of the government can go beyond the precise limits  established by the fundamental law. Like the common law, the  Constitution was thus the result of a slow evolution. Mr. Gladstone, in  his oft-quoted remark, gave an erroneous impression when he said:        \"As the British Constitution is the most subtle organism which has      proceeded from progressive history, so the American Constitution is      the most wonderful work ever struck off, at a given time by the      brain and purpose of man.\"    This assumes that the Constitution sprang, like Minerva, armed  _cap-a-pie,_ from the brain of the American people, whereas it was as  much the result of a slow, laborious, and painful evolution as was the  British Constitution. Probably Gladstone so understood the development  of the American Constitution and recognized that its framing was only  the culmination of an evolution of many years.    When the constitutional struggle between the colonies and the Parliament  became acute, the necessity of a union for a common defence became  imperative. As early as July, 1773, Franklin recommended the \"convening  of a General Congress\" so that the colonies would act together. His  suggestion was introduced in the Virginia House of Burgesses in May,  1774, and as a result there met in Philadelphia on September 5 of that  year the first Continental Congress, styled by themselves: \"The  Delegates appointed by the Good People of these Colonies.\" Nothing was  further from their purpose than to form a central government or to  separate from England. This Congress only met as a conference of  representatives of the colonies to defend what they conceived to be  their constitutional rights.    Before the second Continental Congress met in the following year, the  accidental clash at Lexington and Concord had taken place, and as the  Congress again re-convened a momentous change had taken place, which  was, in fact, the beginning of the American Commonwealth. The Congress  became by force of circumstances a provisional government, and as such  it might well have claimed plenary powers to meet an immediate exigency.  So indisposed were they to separate from England or to substitute for  its rule that of a new government, that the Continental Congress, when  it then involuntarily took over the government of America, failed to  exercise any adequate power. It remained simply a conference without  real power. Each colony had one vote and the rule of unanimity  prevailed. Even its decisions were largely advisory, for they amounted  to little more than recommendations to the constituent States as to what  measures should be taken. Each colony complied with the recommendation  in its discretion and in its own way. Notwithstanding this fatal lack of  authority, the Continental Congress, then actually engaged in civil war,  created an army, and, through its committees, entered into negotiations  with foreign nations. To support the former, it issued paper money, with  the disastrous result that could be readily anticipated. While it had a  presiding officer, it had no executive, and the new nation, which was  hardly conscious of its own birth, had no judiciary.    Had this _de facto_ government assumed the plenary powers which  provisional governments must, under similar circumstances, necessarily  assume, it would have been better for the cause of the colonists. For  want of an efficient central government, the civil administration of the  infant nation was marked by a weakness and incapacity that defeated  Washington's plans and nearly broke his spirit. Washington's little army  was the victim of the gross incapacity of an impotent government. The  soldiers came and went, not as the general commanded, but as the various  colonies permitted. The tragedy of Valley Forge, when the little army  nearly starved to death, and literally the soldiers could be tracked  over the snows by their bleeding, unshod feet, was not due to lack of  clothing and provisions, but to the gross incapacity of a headless  government that if it had had the wisdom to act lacked the authority.  The situation was one of chaos. The colonies recruited their own  contingents, paid such taxes as they pleased, which grew increasingly  less, and the Congress had no coercive power to enforce its policies,  either with reference to internal or external affairs. This situation  was so clearly recognized that immediately after the Declaration of  Independence on July 4, 1776, the draft of a constitution was proposed  to give the central government more effective power; but, although the  necessity was manifest and most urgent, the so-called Articles of  Confederation, which were then drafted in 1776, were never finally  adopted by the requisite number of States until March, 1781, when the  war was nearly over. As the result proved, they marked only a very small  advance over the existing _de facto_ government, for the constituent  States were still too jealous of each other and too hostile to the  creation of a central government to form a truly effective government.  The founders of the Republic could only learn from their errors, but it  is their great merit that they had the ability to profit in the stern  school of experience, of which Franklin has said that it is a \"dear  school, but fools will learn in no other.\"    The founders of the Republic were not fools, and while they did not, as  Gladstone seems to intimate, have the inspired wisdom to develop a  wonderful Constitution by sheer intuition unaided by experience, they  did have the ability to make of their very errors the stepping-stones to  a higher destiny.    By the Articles of Confederation, which, as stated, became effective in  1781, the conduct of foreign affairs was vested in the new government,  which was also given the power to create admiralty courts, regulate  coinage, maintain an army and navy, borrow money, and emit bills of  credit, but the great limitation was that in all other respects the  constituent States retained absolute power, especially with reference to  commerce and taxation. All that the central government could do was to  requisition the States to furnish food supplies, and the States were  then left to impose the taxes and, if necessary, to enforce their  payment in their own way, with the inevitable result that they vied with  each other in the struggle to evade them. The Confederation had no  direct power over the citizens of the several States. Moreover, the  Congress could not levy any taxes, or indeed pass any measure unless  nine out of the thirteen States agreed, and the Constitution could not  be amended except by unanimous vote. While the Congress could select a  presiding officer to serve for one year, yet he had no real executive  authority. During the recess of the Congress, a committee of thirteen,  consisting of one delegate from each State, had _ad interim_ powers, but  not greater than the Congress, which they represented.    Such a government would have been fatal to any people, and so it nearly  proved to be to the infant nation. Two circumstances saved them from the  consequences of such incapacity: one was the invaluable aid of France,  and the other the personality of George Washington. Of this great  leader, one of the noblest that ever \"lived in the tide of time,\" it is  only necessary to quote the fine tribute paid to him by the greatest of  the Victorian novelists in his _Virginians_:        \"What a constancy, what a magnanimity, what a surprising      persistence against fortune!... Washington, the chief of a nation      in arms, doing battle with distracted parties; calm in the midst of      conspiracy; serene against the open foe before him and the darker      enemies at his back; Washington, inspiring order and spirit into      troops hungry and in rags; stung by ingratitude, but betraying no      anger, and every ready to forgive; in defeat invincible, magnanimous      in conquest and never so sublime as on that day when he laid down      his victorious sword and sought his noble retirement--here, indeed,      is a character to admire and revere; a life without a stain, a fame      without a flaw.\"    A year after the Articles of Confederation had been adopted, the war  came to an end by a preliminary treaty on November 30, 1782.    Now follows the least known chapter in American history. It was a period  of travail, of which the Constitution of the United States and the  present American nation were born. The"]]]
