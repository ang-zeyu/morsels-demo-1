In spite of all the warnings, Aponitolau continued his journey,  and upon coming to the ocean he used magical power, so that when he  stepped on his head-ax it sailed away, carrying him far across the  sea to the other side. Then after a short walk he came to a spring  where women were dipping water, and he asked what spring it was.    \"This is the spring of Gawigawen of Adasen,\" replied the women. \"And  who are you that you dare come here?\"    Without replying he went on toward the town, but he found that he  could not go inside, for it was surrounded by a bank which reached  almost to the sky.    While he stood with bowed head pondering what he should do, the chief  of the spiders came up and asked why he was so sorrowful.    \"I am sad,\" answered Aponitolau, \"because I cannot climb up this bank.\"    Then the spider went to the top and spun a thread, [38] and upon this  Aponitolau climbed up into town.    Now Gawigawen was asleep in his spirit house, and when he awoke and  saw Aponitolau sitting near, he was surprised and ran toward his house  to get his spear and head-ax, but Aponitolau called to him, saying:    \"Good morning, Cousin Gawigawen. Do not be angry; I only came to buy  some of your oranges for my wife.\"    Then Gawigawen took him to the house and brought a whole carabao [39]  for him to eat, and he said:    \"If you cannot eat all the carabao, you cannot have the oranges for  your wife.\"    Aponitolau grew very sorrowful, for he knew that he could not eat all  the meat, but just at that moment the chief of the ants and flies  came to him and inquired what was the trouble. As soon as he was  told, the chief called all the ants and flies and they ate the whole  carabao. Aponitolau, greatly relieved, went then to Gawigawen and said:    \"I have finished eating the food which you gave me.\"    Gawigawen was greatly surprised at this, and, leading the way to the  place where the oranges grew, he told Aponitolau to climb the tree  and get all he wanted.    As he was about to ascend the tree Aponitolau noticed that the branches  were sharp knives, so he went as carefully as he could. Nevertheless,  when he had secured two oranges, he stepped on one of the knives and  was cut. He quickly fastened the fruit to his spear, and immediately  it flew away straight to his town and into his house.    Aponibolinayen was just going down the bamboo ladder out of the house,  and hearing something drop on the floor she went back to look and found  the oranges from Adasen. She eagerly ate the fruit, rejoicing that  her husband had been able to reach the place where they grew. Then  she thought to look at the vine, whose leaves were wilted, and she  knew that her husband was dead.    Soon after this a son was born to Aponibolinayen, and she called his  name Kanag. He grew rapidly, becoming a strong lad, and he was the  bravest of all his companions. One day while Kanag was playing out  in the yard, he spun his top and it struck the garbage pot of an old  woman, who became very angry and cried:    \"If you were a brave boy, you would get your father whom Gawigawen  killed.\"    Kanag ran to the house crying, and asked his mother what the old woman  meant, for he had never heard the story of his father's death. As  soon as he learned what had happened, the boy determined to search for  his father, and, try as she would, his mother could not dissuade him.    As he was departing through the gate of the town with his spear  and head-ax, Kanag struck his shield and it sounded like a thousand  warriors.    \"How brave that boy is!\" said the surprised people. \"He is braver  even than his father.\"    When he reached the spring of the giantess, he again struck his shield  and shouted so that the whole world trembled. Then the giantess said:    \"I believe that someone is going to fight, and he will have success.\"    As soon as Kanag reached the place where the old woman, Alokotan,  lived, she sent her dog after him, but with one blow of his head-ax  he cut off the dog's head. Then Alokotan asked where he was going,  and when he had told her, she said:    \"Your father is dead, but I believe that you will find him, for you  have a good sign.\"    He hurried on and arrived at the place where lightning was, and  it asked:    \"Where are you going, little boy?\"    \"I am going to Adasen to get my father,\" answered Kanag.    \"Go stand on that high rock that I may see what your sign is,\" said  the lightning.    So he stood on the high rock, and when the bright flash came he did  not move, and the lightning bade him hasten on, as he had a good sign.    The thunder, which saw him passing, also called to ask where he was  going, and it commanded him to stand on the high rock. And when the  thunder made a loud noise Kanag did not move, and it bade him go on,  as his sign was good.    The women of Adasen were at the spring of Gawigawen dipping water, when  suddenly they were startled by a great noise. They rose up, expecting  to see a thousand warriors coming near; but though they looked all  around they could see nothing but a young boy striking a shield.    \"Good morning, women who are dipping water,\" said Kanag. \"Tell  Gawigawen that he must prepare, for I am coming to fight him.\"    So all the women ran up to the town and told Gawigawen that a strange  boy was at the spring and he had come to fight.    \"Go and tell him,\" said Gawigawen, \"that if it is true that he is  brave, he will come into the town, if he can.\"    When Kanag reached the high bank outside the town, he jumped like  a flitting bird up the bank into the town and went straight to the  spirit house of Gawigawen. He noticed that the roofs of both the  dwelling and the spirit houses were of hair, and that around the town  were many heads, [40] and he pondered:    \"This is why my father did not return. Gawigawen is a brave man,  but I will kill him.\"    As soon as Gawigawen saw him in the yard he said:    \"How brave you are, little boy; why did you come here?\"    \"I came to get my father,\" answered Kanag; \"for you kept him when  he came to get oranges for my mother. If you do not give him to me,  I will kill you.\"    Gawigawen laughed at this brave speech and said:    \"Why, one of my fingers will fight you. You shall never go back to  your town, but you shall stay here and be like your father.\"    \"We shall see,\" said Kanag. \"Bring your arms and let us fight here  in the yard.\"    Gawigawen was beside himself with rage at this bold speech, and  he brought his spear and his head-ax which was as big as half the  sky. Kanag would not throw first, for he wanted to prove himself  brave, so Gawigawen took aim and threw his head-ax at the boy. Now  Kanag used magical power, so that he became an ant and was not hit  by the weapon. Gawigawen laughed loudly when he looked around and  could not see the boy, for he thought that he had been killed. Soon,  however, Kanag reappeared, standing on the head-ax, and Gawigawen,  more furious than ever, threw his spear. Again Kanag disappeared,  and Gawigawen was filled with surprise.    Then it was Kanag's turn and his spear went directly through the body  of the giant. He ran quickly and cut off five of the heads, [41] but  the sixth he spared until Gawigawen should have shown him his father.    As they went about the town together, Kanag found that the skin of his  father had been used for a drum-head. His hair decorated the house,  and his head was at the gate of the town, while his body was put  beneath the house. After he had gathered all the parts of the body  together, Kanag used magical power, and his father came to life.    \"Who are you?\" asked Aponitolau; \"how long have I slept?\"    \"I am your son,\" said Kanag. \"You were not asleep but dead, and here  is Gawigawen who kept you. Take my head-ax and cut off his remaining  head.\"    So Aponitolau took the head-ax, but when he struck Gawigawen it did  not injure him.    \"What is the matter, Father?\" asked Kanag; and taking the weapon he  cut off the sixth head of Gawigawen.    Then Kanag and his father used magic so that the spears and head-axes  flew about, killing all the people in the town, and the heads and  valuable things went to their home.    When Aponibolinayen saw all these come into her house, she ran to  look at the vine by the stove, and it was green and looked like a  jungle. Then she knew that her son was alive, and she was happy. And  when the father and son returned, all the relatives came to their house  for a great feast, and all were so happy that the whole world smiled.        The Story of Gaygayoma who Lives up Above    _Tinguian_      One day, while Aponitolau sat weaving a basket under his house, he  began to feel very hungry and longed for something sweet to chew. Then  he remembered that his field was still unplanted. He called to his  wife who was in the room above, and said: \"Come, Aponibolinayen,  let us go to the field and plant some sugar-cane.\"    So Aponibolinayen came down out of the house with a bamboo tube, [42]  and while she went to the spring to fill it with water, Aponitolau  made some cuttings, and they went together to the field, which was  some distance from the house.    Aponitolau loosened the earth with his long stick [43] and set out the  cuttings he had brought, while his wife sprinkled them with water from  the bamboo tube. And when they had filled the field, they returned  home, happy to think of the splendid cane they should have.    After seven days Aponitolau went back to the field to see if the  plants had lived, and he found that the leaves were already long and  pointed. This delighted him, and while he stood looking at it he grew  impatient and determined to use his magical power so that the cane  would grow very fast. In five days he again visited the field and  found that the stalks were tall and ready to chew.
