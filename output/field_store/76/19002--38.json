Who shall say what subtle instinct caused  Octavia to turn and smile at him with a wistful, friendly look that  warmed his heart? He met it with an answering glance, which thrilled her  strangely, for love, gratitude, and some mysterious intelligence met and  mingled in the brilliant yet soft expression which swiftly shone and  faded in her face. What it was she could not tell; she only felt that it  filled her with an indescribable emotion never experienced before. In an  instant it all passed, Lady Treherne spoke to her, and Blanche Talbot  addressed Maurice, wondering, as she did so, if the enchanting smile he  wore was meant for her.    \"Mr. Annon having mercifully set me free, I came to try to cheer your  solitude; but you look as if solitude made you happier than society does  the rest of us,\" she said without her usual affectation, for his manner  impressed her.    \"You are very kind and very welcome. I do find pleasures to beguile my  loneliness, which gayer people would not enjoy, and it is well that I  can, else I should turn morose and tyrannical, and doom some unfortunate  to entertain me all day long.\" He answered with a gentle courtesy which  was his chief attraction to womankind.    \"Pray tell me some of your devices, I'm often alone in spirit, if not so  in the flesh, for Rose, though a dear girl, is not congenial, and I find  no kindred soul.\"    A humorous glimmer came to Treherne's eyes, as the sentimental damsel  beamed a soft sigh and drooped her long lashes effectively. Ignoring the  topic of \"kindred souls,\" he answered coldly, \"My favorite amusement is  studying the people around me. It may be rude, but tied to my corner, I  cannot help watching the figures around me, and discovering their little  plots and plans. I'm getting very expert, and really surprise myself  sometimes by the depth of my researches.\"    \"I can believe it; your eyes look as if they possessed that gift.  Pray don't study _me_.\" And the girl shrank away with an air of  genuine alarm.    Treherne smiled involuntarily, for he had read the secret of that  shallow heart long ago, and was too generous to use the knowledge,  however flattering it might be to him. In a reassuring tone he said,  turning away the keen eyes she feared, \"I give you my word I never will,  charming as it might be to study the white pages of a maidenly heart. I  find plenty of others to read, so rest tranquil, Miss Blanche.\"    \"Who interests you most just now?\" asked the girl, coloring with  pleasure at his words. \"Mrs. Snowdon looks like one who has a romance to  be read, if you have the skill.\"    \"I have read it. My lady is my study just now. I thought I knew her  well, but of late she puzzles me. Human minds are more full of  mysteries than any written book and more changeable than the cloud  shapes in the air.\"    \"A fine old lady, but I fear her so intensely I should never dare to try  to read her, as you say.\" Blanche looked toward the object of discussion  as she spoke, and added, \"Poor Tavia, how forlorn she seems. Let me ask  her to join us, may I?\"    \"With all my heart\" was the quick reply.    Blanche glided away but did not return, for my lady kept her as well as  her daughter.    \"That test satisfies me; well, I submit for a time, but I think I can  conquer my aunt yet.\" And with a patient sigh Treherne turned to observe  Mrs. Snowdon.    She now stood by the fire talking with Sir Jasper, a handsome, reckless,  generous-hearted young gentleman, who very plainly showed his great  admiration for the lady. When he came, she suddenly woke up from her  listless mood and became as brilliantly gay as she had been unmistakably  melancholy before. As she chatted, she absently pushed to and fro a  small antique urn of bronze on the chimneypiece, and in doing so she  more than once gave Treherne a quick, significant glance, which he  answered at last by a somewhat haughty nod. Then, as if satisfied, she  ceased toying with the ornament and became absorbed in Sir Jasper's  gallant badinage.    The instant her son approached Mrs. Snowdon, Madame Mere grew anxious,  and leaving Octavia to her friends and lover, she watched Jasper. But  her surveillance availed little, for she could neither see nor hear  anything amiss, yet could not rid herself of the feeling that some  mutual understanding existed between them. When the party broke up for  the night, she lingered till all were gone but her son and nephew.    \"Well, Madame Ma Mere, what troubles you?\" asked Sir Jasper, as she  looked anxiously into his face before bestowing her good-night kiss.    \"I cannot tell, yet I feel ill at ease. Remember, my son, that you are  the pride of my heart, and any sin or shame of yours would kill me. Good  night, Maurice.\" And with a stately bow she swept away.    Lounging with both elbows on the low chimneypiece, Sir Jasper smiled at  his mother's fears, and said to his cousin, the instant they were alone,  \"She is worried about E.S. Odd, isn't it, what instinctive antipathies  women take to one another?\"    \"Why did you ask E.S. here?\" demanded Treherne.    \"My dear fellow, how could I help it? My mother wanted the general, my  father's friend, and of course his wife must be asked also. I couldn't  tell my mother that the lady had been a most arrant coquette, to put it  mildly, and had married the old man in a pet, because my cousin and I  declined to be ruined by her.\"    \"You _could_ have told her what mischief she makes wherever she goes,  and for Octavia's sake have deferred the general's visit for a time. I  warn you, Jasper, harm will come of it.\"    \"To whom, you or me?\"    \"To both, perhaps, certainly to you. She was disappointed once when she  lost us both by wavering between your title and my supposed fortune. She  is miserable with the old man, and her only hope is in his death, for he  is very feeble. You are free, and doubly attractive now, so beware, or  she will entangle you before you know it.\"    \"Thanks, Mentor. I've no fear, and shall merely amuse myself for a  week--they stay no longer.\" And with a careless laugh, Sir Jasper  strolled away.    \"Much mischief may be done in a week, and this is the beginning of it,\"  muttered Treherne, as he raised himself to look under the bronze vase  for the note. It was gone!          Chapter III      WHO WAS IT?    Who had taken it? This question tormented Treherne all that sleepless  night. He suspected three persons, for only these had approached the  fire after the note was hidden. He had kept his eye on it, he thought,  till the stir of breaking up. In that moment it must have been removed  by the major, Frank Annon, or my lady; Sir Jasper was out of the  question, for he never touched an ornament in the drawing room since he  had awkwardly demolished a whole _etagere_ of costly trifles, to  his mother's and sister's great grief. The major evidently suspected  something, Annon was jealous, and my lady would be glad of a pretext to  remove her daughter from his reach. Trusting to his skill in reading  faces, he waited impatiently for morning, resolving to say nothing to  anyone but Mrs. Snowdon, and from her merely to inquire what the note  contained.    Treherne usually was invisible till lunch, often till dinner; therefore,  fearing to excite suspicion by unwonted activity, he did not appear till  noon. The mailbag had just been opened, and everyone was busy over their  letters, but all looked up to exchange a word with the newcomer, and  Octavia impulsively turned to meet him, then checked herself and hid her  suddenly crimsoned face behind a newspaper. Treherne's eye took in  everything, and saw at once in the unusually late arrival of the mail a  pretext for discovering the pilferer of the note.    \"All have letters but me, yet I expected one last night. Major, have you  got it among yours?\" And as he spoke, Treherne fixed his penetrating  eyes full on the person he addressed.    With no sign of consciousness, no trace of confusion, the major  carefully turned over his pile, and replied in the most natural manner,  \"Not a trace of it; I wish there was, for nothing annoys me more than  any delay or mistake about my letters.\"    He knows nothing of it, thought Treherne, and turned to Annon, who was  deep in a long epistle from some intimate friend, with a talent for  imparting news, to judge from the reader's interest.    \"Annon, I appeal to you, for I _must_ discover who has robbed me of  my letter.\"    \"I have but one, read it, if you will, and satisfy yourself\" was the  brief reply.    \"No, thank you. I merely asked in joke; it is doubtless among my lady's.  Jasper's letters and mine often get mixed, and my lady takes care of his  for him. I think you must have it, Aunt.\"    Lady Treherne looked up impatiently. \"My dear Maurice, what a coil about  a letter! We none of us have it, so do not punish us for the sins of  your correspondent or the carelessness of the post.\"    She was not the thief, for she is always intensely polite when she  intends to thwart me, thought Treherne, and, apologizing for his  rudeness in disturbing them, he rolled himself to his nook in a sunny  window and became apparently absorbed in a new magazine.    Mrs. Snowdon was opening the general's letters for him, and, having  finished her little task, she roamed away into the library, as if in  search of a book. Presently returning with one, she approached Treherne,  and, putting it into his hand, said, in her musically distinct voice,  \"Be so kind as to find for me the passage you spoke of last night. I am  curious to see it.\"    Instantly comprehending her stratagem, he opened it with apparent  carelessness, secured the tiny note laid among the leaves, and,  selecting a passage at hazard, returned her book and resumed his own.  Behind the cover of it he unfolded and read these words:        _I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/87"],[0,"The 1993 CIA World Factbook (#4)"],[1," Badghis, Baghlan,    Balkh, Bamian, Farah, Faryab, Ghazni, Ghowr, Helmand, Herat, Jowzjan, Kabol,    Kandahar, Kapisa, Konar, Kondoz, Laghman, Lowgar, Nangarhar, Nimruz,    Oruzgan, Paktia, Paktika, Parvan, Samangan, Sar-e Pol, Takhar, Vardak, Zabol   note:    there may be a new province of Nurestan (Nuristan)  Independence:    19 August 1919 (from UK)  Constitution:    the old Communist-era constitution has been suspended; a new Islamic    constitution has yet to be ratified  Legal system:    a new legal system has not been adopted but the transitional government has    declared it will follow Islamic law (Shari'a)  National holiday:    Victory of the Muslim Nation, 28 April; Remembrance Day for Martyrs and    Disabled, 4 May; Independence Day, 19 August  Political parties and leaders:    current political organizations include Jamiat-i-Islami (Islamic Society),    Burhanuddin RABBANI, Ahmad Shah MASOOD; Hizbi Islami-Gulbuddin (Islamic    Party), Gulbuddin HIKMATYAR faction; Hizbi Islami-Khalis (Islamic Party)    Yunis KHALIS faction; Ittihad-i-Islami Barai Azadi Afghanistan (Islamic    Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan), Abdul Rasul SAYYAF;    Harakat-Inqilab-i-Islami (Islamic Revolutionary Movement), Mohammad Nabi    MOHAMMADI; Jabha-i-Najat-i-Milli Afghanistan (Afghanistan National    Liberation Front), Sibghatullah MOJADDEDI; Mahaz-i-Milli-Islami (National    Islamic Front), Sayed Ahamad GAILANI; Hizbi Wahdat (Islamic Unity Party),    Abdul Ali MAZARI; Harakat-i-Islami (Islamic Movement), Mohammed Asif    MOHSENI; a new northern organization consisting of resistance and former    regional figures is Jonbesh-i-Milli Islami (National Islamic Movement),    Rashid DOSTUM   note:    the former ruling Watan Party has been disbanded  Other political or pressure groups:    the former resistance commanders are the major power brokers in the    countryside; shuras (councils) of commanders are now administering most    cities outside Kabul; ulema (religious scholars); tribal elders  Suffrage:    undetermined; previously universal, male ages 15-50  Elections:   President:   last held NA December 1992 (next to be held NA December 1994); results -    Burhanuddin RABBANI was elected to a two-year term by a national shura    *Afghanistan, Government    Executive branch:    president, prime minister; Afghan leaders are still in the process of    choosing a cabinet (May 1993)  Legislative branch:    a unicameral parliament consisting of 205 members was chosen by the shura in    January 1993; non-functioning as of June 1993  Judicial branch:    an interim Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has been appointed, but a new    court system has not yet been organized  Leaders:   Chief of State:    President Burhanuddin RABBANI (since 2 January 1993); First Vice President    Mohammad NABI Mohammadi (since NA); First Vice President Mohammad SHAH Fazli    (since NA)   Head of Government:    Prime Minister-designate Gulbaddin HIKMATYAR (since NA); Deputy Prime    Minister Sulayman GAILANI (since NA); Deputy Prime Minister Din MOHAMMAD    (since NA); Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad SHAH Ahmadzai (since NA)  Member of:    AsDB (has previously been a member of), CP, ECO, ESCAP, FAO, G-77, IAEA,    IBRD, ICAO, IDA, IDB, IFAD, IFC, ILO, IMF, INTELSAT, IOC, ITU, LORCS, NAM,    OIC, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO, UPU, WFTU, WHO, WMO, WTO  Diplomatic representation in US:   chief of mission:    (vacant); Charge d'Affaires Abdul RAHIM   chancery:    2341 Wyoming Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20008   telephone:    (202) 234-3770 or 3771  US diplomatic representation:   chief of mission:    (vacant)   embassy:    Ansari Wat, Wazir Akbar Khan Mina, Kabul   mailing address:    use embassy street address   telephone:    62230 through 62235 or 62436   note:    US Embassy in Kabul was closed in January 1989  Flag:    a new flag of unknown description reportedly has been adopted; previous flag    consisted of three equal horizontal bands of black (top), red, and green,    with the national coat of arms superimposed on the hoist side of the black    and red bands; similar to the flag of Malawi, which is shorter and bears a    radiant, rising red sun centered in the black band    *Afghanistan, Economy    Overview:    Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly    dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep and    goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political and    military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including the nearly    10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). Over the    past decade, one-third of the population fled the country, with Pakistan    sheltering more than 3 million refugees and Iran about 1.3 million. Another    1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan.
