[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#4)"],[1," the great Sorceress, Glinda the  Good, is permitted to practice her arts, which never harm anybody. The  Wizard of Oz, who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all, has  been taking lessons of Glinda, and I'm told he is getting to be a  pretty good Wizard; but he is merely the assistant of the great  Sorceress. I've the right to make a servant girl for my wife, you know,  or a Glass Cat to catch our mice--which she refuses to do--but I am  forbidden to work magic for others, or to use it as a profession.\"    \"Magic must be a very interesting study,\" said Ojo.    \"It truly is,\" asserted the Magician. \"In my time I've performed some  magical feats that were worthy of the skill of Glinda the Good. For  instance, there's the Powder of Life, and my Liquid of Petrifaction,  which is contained in that bottle on the shelf yonder--over the window.\"    \"What does the Liquid of Petrifaction do?\" inquired the boy.    \"Turns everything it touches to solid marble. It's an invention of my  own, and I find it very useful. Once two of those dreadful Kalidahs,  with bodies like bears and heads like tigers, came here from the forest  to attack us; but I sprinkled some of that Liquid on them and instantly  they turned to marble. I now use them as ornamental statuary in my  garden. This table looks to you like wood, and once it really was wood;  but I sprinkled a few drops of the Liquid of Petrifaction on it and now  it is marble. It will never break nor wear out.\"    \"Fine!\" said Unc Nunkie, wagging his head and stroking his long gray  beard.    \"Dear me; what a chatterbox you're getting to be, Unc,\" remarked the  Magician, who was pleased with the compliment. But just then there came  a scratching at the back door and a shrill voice cried:    \"Let me in! Hurry up, can't you? Let me in!\"    Margolotte got up and went to the door.    \"Ask like a good cat, then,\" she said.    \"Mee-ee-ow-w-w! There; does that suit your royal highness?\" asked the  voice, in scornful accents.    \"Yes; that's proper cat talk,\" declared the woman, and opened the door.    At once a cat entered, came to the center of the room and stopped short  at the sight of strangers. Ojo and Unc Nunkie both stared at it with  wide open eyes, for surely no such curious creature had ever existed  before--even in the Land of Oz.          Chapter Four    The Glass Cat      The cat was made of glass, so clear and transparent that you could see  through it as easily as through a window. In the top of its head,  however, was a mass of delicate pink balls which looked like jewels,  and it had a heart made of a blood-red ruby. The eyes were two large  emeralds, but aside from these colors all the rest of the animal was  clear glass, and it had a spun-glass tail that was really beautiful.    \"Well, Doc Pipt, do you mean to introduce us, or not?\" demanded the  cat, in a tone of annoyance. \"Seems to me you are forgetting your  manners.\"    \"Excuse me,\" returned the Magician. \"This is Unc Nunkie, the descendant  of the former kings of the Munchkins, before this country became a part  of the Land of Oz.\"    \"He needs a haircut,\" observed the cat, washing its face.    \"True,\" replied Unc, with a low chuckle of amusement.    \"But he has lived alone in the heart of the forest for many years,\" the  Magician explained; \"and, although that is a barbarous country, there  are no barbers there.\"    \"Who is the dwarf?\" asked the cat.    \"That is not a dwarf, but a boy,\" answered the Magician. \"You have  never seen a boy before. He is now small because he is young. With more  years he will grow big and become as tall as Unc Nunkie.\"    \"Oh. Is that magic?\" the glass animal inquired.    \"Yes; but it is Nature's magic, which is more wonderful than any art  known to man. For instance, my magic made you, and made you live; and  it was a poor job because you are useless and a bother to me; but I  can't make you grow. You will always be the same size--and the same  saucy, inconsiderate Glass Cat, with pink brains and a hard ruby heart.\"    \"No one can regret more than I the fact that you made me,\" asserted the  cat, crouching upon the floor and slowly swaying its spun-glass tail  from side to side. \"Your world is a very uninteresting place. I've  wandered through your gardens and in the forest until I'm tired of it  all, and when I come into the house the conversation of your fat wife  and of yourself bores me dreadfully.\"    \"That is because I gave you different brains from those we ourselves  possess--and much too good for a cat,\" returned Dr. Pipt.    \"Can't you take 'em out, then, and replace 'em with pebbles, so that I  won't feel above my station in life?\" asked the cat, pleadingly.    \"Perhaps so. I'll try it, after I've brought the Patchwork Girl to  life,\" he said.    The cat walked up to the bench on which the Patchwork Girl reclined and  looked at her attentively.    \"Are you going to make that dreadful thing live?\" she asked.    The Magician nodded.    \"It is intended to be my wife's servant maid,\" he said. \"When she is  alive she will do all our work and mind the house. But you are not to  order her around, Bungle, as you do us. You must treat the Patchwork  Girl respectfully.\"    \"I won't. I couldn't respect such a bundle of scraps under any  circumstances.\"    \"If you don't, there will be more scraps than you will like,\" cried  Margolotte, angrily.    \"Why didn't you make her pretty to look at?\" asked the cat. \"You made  me pretty--very pretty, indeed--and I love to watch my pink brains roll  around when they're working, and to see my precious red heart beat.\"  She went to a long mirror, as she said this, and stood before it,  looking at herself with an air of much pride. \"But that poor patched  thing will hate herself, when she's once alive,\" continued the cat. \"If  I were you I'd use her for a mop, and make another servant that is  prettier.\"    \"You have a perverted taste,\" snapped Margolotte, much annoyed at this  frank criticism. \"I think the Patchwork Girl is beautiful, considering  what she's made of. Even the rainbow hasn't as many colors, and you  must admit that the rainbow is a pretty thing.\"    The Glass Cat yawned and stretched herself upon the floor.    \"Have your own way,\" she said. \"I'm sorry for the Patchwork Girl,  that's all.\"    Ojo and Unc Nunkie slept that night in the Magician's house, and the  boy was glad to stay because he was anxious to see the Patchwork Girl  brought to life. The Glass Cat was also a wonderful creature to little  Ojo, who had never seen or known anything of magic before, although he  had lived in the Fairyland of Oz ever since he was born. Back there in  the woods nothing unusual ever happened. Unc Nunkie, who might have  been King of the Munchkins, had not his people united with all the  other countries of Oz in acknowledging Ozma as their sole ruler, had  retired into this forgotten forest nook with his baby nephew and they  had lived all alone there. Only that the neglected garden had failed to  grow food for them, they would always have lived in the solitary Blue  Forest; but now they had started out to mingle with other people, and  the first place they came to proved so interesting that Ojo could  scarcely sleep a wink all night.    Margolotte was an excellent cook and gave them a fine breakfast. While  they were all engaged in eating, the good woman said:    \"This is the last meal I shall have to cook for some time, for right  after breakfast Dr. Pipt has promised to bring my new servant to life.  I shall let her wash the breakfast dishes and sweep and dust the house.  What a relief it will be!\"    \"It will, indeed, relieve you of much drudgery,\" said the Magician. \"By  the way, Margolotte, I thought I saw you getting some brains from the  cupboard, while I was busy with my kettles. What qualities have you  given your new servant?\"    \"Only those that an humble servant requires,\" she answered. \"I do not  wish her to feel above her station, as the Glass Cat does. That would  make her discontented and unhappy, for of course she must always be a  servant.\"    Ojo was somewhat disturbed as he listened to this, and the boy began to  fear he had done wrong in adding all those different qualities of  brains to the lot Margolotte had prepared for the servant. But it was  too late now for regret, since all the brains were securely sewn up  inside the Patchwork Girl's head. He might have confessed what he had  done and thus allowed Margolotte and her husband to change the brains;  but he was afraid of incurring their anger. He believed that Unc had  seen him add to the brains, and Unc had not said a word against it; but  then, Unc never did say anything unless it was absolutely necessary.    As soon as breakfast was over they all went into the Magician's big  workshop, where the Glass Cat was lying before the mirror and the  Patchwork Girl lay limp and lifeless upon the bench.    \"Now, then,\" said Dr. Pipt, in a brisk tone, \"we shall perform one of  the greatest feats of magic possible to man, even in this marvelous  Land of Oz. In no other country could it be done at all. I think we  ought to have a little music while the Patchwork Girl comes to life. It  is pleasant to reflect that the first sounds her golden ears will hear  will be delicious music.\"    As he spoke he went to a phonograph, which screwed fast to a small  table, and wound up the spring of the instrument and adjusted the big  gold horn.    \"The music my servant will usually hear,\" remarked Margolotte, \"will be  my orders to do her work. But I see no harm in allowing her to listen  to this unseen band while she wakens to her first realization of life.  My orders will beat the band, afterward.\"    The phonograph was now playing a stirring march tune and the Magician  unlocked his cabinet and took out the gold bottle containing the Powder  of Life.    They all bent over the bench on which the Patchwork Girl reclined. Unc  Nunkie and Margolotte stood behind, near the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#4)"],[1,"camp, the  officers and private sleeping in hammocks attached to their tent poles.    There was also in the knapsack a flag bearing the royal emblem of  Oogaboo, and this flag Files flew upon its staff every night, to show  that the country they were in had been conquered by the Queen of  Oogaboo. So far, no one but themselves had seen the flag, but Ann was  pleased to see it flutter in the breeze and considered herself already  a famous conqueror.          Chapter Four    Betsy Braves the Billows      The waves dashed and the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled and  the ship struck a rock. Betsy Bobbin was running across the deck and  the shock sent her flying through the air until she fell with a splash  into the dark blue water. The same shock caught Hank, a thin little,  sad-faced mule, and tumbled him also into the sea, far from the ship's  side.    When Betsy came up, gasping for breath because the wet plunge had  surprised her, she reached out in the dark and grabbed a bunch of hair.  At first she thought it was the end of a rope, but presently she heard  a dismal \"Hee-haw!\" and knew she was holding fast to the end of Hank's  tail.    Suddenly the sea was lighted up by a vivid glare. The ship, now in the  far distance, caught fire, blew up and sank beneath the waves.    Betsy shuddered at the sight, but just then her eye caught a mass of  wreckage floating near her and she let go the mule's tail and seized  the rude raft, pulling herself up so that she rode upon it in safety.  Hank also saw the raft and swam to it, but he was so clumsy he never  would have been able to climb upon it had not Betsy helped him to get  aboard.    They had to crowd close together, for their support was only a  hatch-cover torn from the ship's deck; but it floated them fairly well  and both the girl and the mule knew it would keep them from drowning.    The storm was not over, by any means, when the ship went down. Blinding  bolts of lightning shot from cloud to cloud and the clamor of deep  thunderclaps echoed far over the sea. The waves tossed the little raft  here and there as a child tosses a rubber ball and Betsy had a solemn  feeling that for hundreds of watery miles in every direction there was  no living thing besides herself and the small donkey.    Perhaps Hank had the same thought, for he gently rubbed his nose  against the frightened girl and said \"Hee-haw!\" in his softest voice,  as if to comfort her.    \"You'll protect me, Hank dear, won't you?\" she cried helplessly, and  the mule said \"Hee-haw!\" again, in tones that meant a promise.    On board the ship, during the days that preceded the wreck, when the  sea was calm, Betsy and Hank had become good friends; so, while the  girl might have preferred a more powerful protector in this dreadful  emergency, she felt that the mule would do all in a mule's power to  guard her safety.    All night they floated, and when the storm had worn itself out and  passed away with a few distant growls, and the waves had grown smaller  and easier to ride, Betsy stretched herself out on the wet raft and  fell asleep.    Hank did not sleep a wink. Perhaps he felt it his duty to guard Betsy.  Anyhow, he crouched on the raft beside the tired sleeping girl and  watched patiently until the first light of dawn swept over the sea.    The light wakened Betsy Bobbin. She sat up, rubbed her eyes and stared  across the water.    \"Oh, Hank; there's land ahead!\" she exclaimed.    \"Hee-haw!\" answered Hank in his plaintive voice.    The raft was floating swiftly toward a very beautiful country and as  they drew near Betsy could see banks of lovely flowers showing brightly  between leafy trees. But no people were to be seen at all.          Chapter Five    The Roses Repulse the Refugees      Gently the raft grated on the sandy beach. Then Betsy easily waded  ashore, the mule following closely behind her. The sun was now shining  and the air was warm and laden with the fragrance of roses.    \"I'd like some breakfast, Hank,\" remarked the girl, feeling more  cheerful now that she was on dry land; \"but we can't eat the flowers,  although they do smell mighty good.\"    \"Hee-haw!\" replied Hank and trotted up a little pathway to the top of  the bank.    Betsy followed and from the eminence looked around her. A little way  off stood a splendid big greenhouse, its thousands of crystal panes  glittering in the sunlight.    \"There ought to be people somewhere 'round,\" observed Betsy  thoughtfully; \"gardeners, or somebody. Let's go and see, Hank. I'm  getting hungrier ev'ry minute.\"    So they walked toward the great greenhouse and came to its entrance  without meeting with anyone at all. A door stood ajar, so Hank went in  first, thinking if there was any danger he could back out and warn his  companion. But Betsy was close at his heels and the moment she entered  was lost in amazement at the wonderful sight she saw.    The greenhouse was filled with magnificent rosebushes, all growing in  big pots. On the central stem of each bush bloomed a splendid Rose,  gorgeously colored and deliciously fragrant, and in the center of each  Rose was the face of a lovely girl.    As Betsy and Hank entered, the heads of the Roses were drooping and  their eyelids were closed in slumber; but the mule was so amazed that  he uttered a loud \"Hee-haw!\" and at the sound of his harsh voice the  rose leaves fluttered, the Roses raised their heads and a hundred  startled eyes were instantly fixed upon the intruders.    \"I--I beg your pardon!\" stammered Betsy, blushing and confused.    \"O-o-o-h!\" cried the Roses, in a sort of sighing chorus; and one of  them added: \"What a horrid noise!\"    \"Why, that was only Hank,\" said Betsy, and as if to prove the truth of  her words the mule uttered another loud \"Hee-haw!\"    At this all the Roses turned on their stems as far as they were able  and trembled as if some one were shaking their bushes. A dainty Moss  Rose gasped: \"Dear me! How dreadfully dreadful!\"    \"It isn't dreadful at all,\" said Betsy, somewhat indignant. \"When you  get used to Hank's voice it will put you to sleep.\"    The Roses now looked at the mule less fearfully and one of them asked:    \"Is that savage beast named Hank?\"    \"Yes; Hank's my comrade, faithful and true,\" answered the girl, twining  her arms around the little mule's neck and hugging him tight. \"Aren't  you, Hank?\"    Hank could only say in reply: \"Hee-haw!\" and at his bray the Roses  shivered again.    \"Please go away!\" begged one. \"Can't you see you're frightening us out  of a week's growth?\"    \"Go away!\" echoed Betsy. \"Why, we've no place to go. We've just been  wrecked.\"    \"Wrecked?\" asked the Roses in a surprised chorus.    \"Yes; we were on a big ship and the storm came and wrecked it,\"  explained the girl. \"But Hank and I caught hold of a raft and floated  ashore to this place, and--we're tired and hungry. What country _is_  this, please?\"    \"This is the Rose Kingdom,\" replied the Moss Rose, haughtily, \"and it  is devoted to the culture of the rarest and fairest Roses grown.\"    \"I believe it,\" said Betsy, admiring the pretty blossoms.    \"But only Roses are allowed here,\" continued a delicate Tea Rose,  bending her brows in a frown; \"therefore you must go away before the  Royal Gardener finds you and casts you back into the sea.\"    \"Oh! Is there a Royal Gardener, then?\" inquired Betsy.    \"To be sure.\"    \"And is he a Rose, also?\"    \"Of course not; he's a man--a wonderful man,\" was the reply.    \"Well, I'm not afraid of a man,\" declared the girl, much relieved, and  even as she spoke the Royal Gardener popped into the greenhouse--a  spading fork in one hand and a watering pot in the other.    He was a funny little man, dressed in a rose-colored costume, with  ribbons at his knees and elbows, and a bunch of ribbons in his hair.  His eyes were small and twinkling, his nose sharp and his face puckered  and deeply lined.    \"O-ho!\" he exclaimed, astonished to find strangers in his greenhouse,  and when Hank gave a loud bray the Gardener threw the watering pot over  the mule's head and danced around with his fork, in such agitation that  presently he fell over the handle of the implement and sprawled at full  length upon the ground.    Betsy laughed and pulled the watering pot off from Hank's head. The  little mule was angry at the treatment he had received and backed  toward the Gardener threateningly.    \"Look out for his heels!\" called Betsy warningly and the Gardener  scrambled to his feet and hastily hid behind the Roses.    \"You are breaking the Law!\" he shouted, sticking out his head to glare  at the girl and the mule.    \"What Law?\" asked Betsy.    \"The Law of the Rose Kingdom. No strangers are allowed in these  domains.\"    \"Not when they're shipwrecked?\" she inquired.    \"The Law doesn't except shipwrecks,\" replied the Royal Gardener, and he  was about to say more when suddenly there was a crash of glass and a  man came tumbling through the roof of the greenhouse and fell plump to  the ground.          Chapter Six    Shaggy Seeks his Stray Brother      This sudden arrival was a queer looking man, dressed all in garments so  shaggy that Betsy at first thought he must be some animal. But the  stranger ended his fall in a sitting position and then the girl saw it  was really a man. He held an apple in his hand, which he had evidently  been eating when he fell, and so little was he jarred or flustered by  the accident that he continued to munch this apple as he calmly looked  around him.    \"Good gracious!\" exclaimed Betsy, approaching him. \"Who _are_ you, and  where did you come from?\"    \"Me? Oh, I'm Shaggy Man,\" said he, taking another bite of the apple.  \"Just dropped in for a short call. Excuse my seeming haste.\"    \"Why, I s'pose you couldn't help the haste,\" said Betsy.    \"No. I climbed an apple tree, outside; branch gave way and--here I am.\"    As he spoke the Shaggy Man finished his apple, gave the core to  Hank--who ate it"]]]
