Simon  Girty and his pals, McKee and Elliott, deserted from that thar fort  right afore yer eyes. They're now livin' among the redskins down  Fort Henry way, raisin' as much hell fer the settlers as they kin.\"    \"Is Fort Henry near the Indian towns?\" asked Joe.    \"There's Delawares, Shawnees and Hurons all along the Ohio below  Fort Henry.\"    \"Where is the Moravian Mission located?\"    \"Why, lad, the Village of Peace, as the Injuns call it, is right in  the midst of that Injun country. I 'spect it's a matter of a hundred  miles below and cross-country a little from Fort Henry.\"    \"The fort must be an important point, is it not?\"    \"Wal, I guess so. It's the last place on the river,\" answered Lynn,  with a grim smile. \"There's only a stockade there, an' a handful of  men. The Injuns hev swarmed down on it time and ag'in, but they hev  never burned it. Only such men as Colonel Zane, his brother Jack,  and Wetzel could hev kept that fort standin' all these bloody years.  Eb Zane's got but a few men, yet he kin handle 'em some, an' with  such scouts as Jack Zane and Wetzel, he allus knows what's goin' on  among the Injuns.\"    \"I've heard of Colonel Zane. He was an officer under Lord Dunmore.  The hunters here speak often of Jack Zane and Wetzel. What are  they?\"    \"Jack Zane is a hunter an' guide. I knowed him well a few years  back. He's a quiet, mild chap; but a streak of chain-lightnin' when  he's riled. Wetzel is an Injun-killer. Some people say as how he's  crazy over scalp-huntin'; but I reckon that's not so. I've seen him  a few times. He don't hang round the settlement 'cept when the  Injuns are up, an' nobody sees him much. At home he sets round  silent-like, an' then mebbe next mornin' he'll be gone, an' won't  show up fer days or weeks. But all the frontier knows of his deeds.  Fer instance, I've hearn of settlers gettin' up in the mornin' an'  findin' a couple of dead and scalped Injuns right in front of their  cabins. No one knowed who killed 'em, but everybody says 'Wetzel.'  He's allus warnin' the settlers when they need to flee to the fort,  and sure he's right every time, because when these men go back to  their cabins they find nothin' but ashes. There couldn't be any  farmin' done out there but fer Wetzel.\"    \"What does he look like?\" questioned Joe, much interested.    \"Wetzel stands straight as the oak over thar. He'd hev' to go  sideways to git his shoulders in that door, but he's as light of  foot an' fast as a deer. An' his eyes--why, lad, ye kin hardly look  into 'em. If you ever see Wetzel you'll know him to onct.\"    \"I want to see him,\" Joe spoke quickly, his eyes lighting with an  eager flash. \"He must be a great fighter.\"    \"Is he? Lew Wetzel is the heftiest of 'em all, an' we hev some as  kin fight out here. I was down the river a few years ago and joined  a party to go out an' hunt up some redskins as had been reported.  Wetzel was with us. We soon struck Injun sign, and then come on to a  lot of the pesky varmints. We was all fer goin' home, because we had  a small force. When we started to go we finds Wetzel sittin'  calm-like on a log. We said: 'Ain't ye goin' home?' and he replied,  'I cum out to find redskins, an' now as we've found 'em, I'm not  goin' to run away.' An' we left him settin' thar. Oh, Wetzel is a  fighter!\"    \"I hope I shall see him,\" said Joe once more, the warm light, which  made him look so boyish, still glowing in his face.    \"Mebbe ye'll git to; and sure ye'll see redskins, an' not tame ones,  nuther.\"    At this moment the sound of excited voices near the cabins broke in  on the conversation. Joe saw several persons run toward the large  cabin and disappear behind it. He smiled as he thought perhaps the  commotion had been caused by the awakening of the Indian brave.    Rising to his feet, Joe went toward the cabin, and soon saw the  cause of the excitement. A small crowd of men and women, all  laughing and talking, surrounded the Indian brave and the little  stout fellow. Joe heard some one groan, and then a deep, guttural  voice:    \"Paleface--big steal--ugh! Injun mad--heap mad--kill paleface.\"    After elbowing his way into the group, Joe saw the Indian holding  Loorey with one hand, while he poked him on the ribs with the other.  The captive's face was the picture of dismay; even the streaks of  paint did not hide his look of fear and bewilderment. The poor  half-witted fellow was so badly frightened that he could only groan.    \"Silvertip scalp paleface. Ugh!\" growled the savage, giving Loorey  another blow on the side. This time he bent over in pain. The  bystanders were divided in feeling; the men laughed, while the women  murmured sympathetically.    \"This's not a bit funny,\" muttered Joe, as he pushed his way nearly  to the middle of the crowd. Then he stretched out a long arm that,  bare and brawny, looked as though it might have been a blacksmith's,  and grasped the Indian's sinewy wrist with a force that made him  loosen his hold on Loorey instantly.    \"I stole the shirt--fun--joke,\" said Joe. \"Scalp me if you want to  scalp anyone.\"    The Indian looked quickly at the powerful form before him. With a  twist he slipped his arm from Joe's grasp.    \"Big paleface heap fun--all squaw play,\" he said, scornfully. There  was a menace in his somber eyes as he turned abruptly and left the  group.    \"I'm afraid you've made an enemy,\" said Jake Wentz to Joe. \"An  Indian never forgets an insult, and that's how he regarded your  joke. Silvertip has been friendly here because he sells us his  pelts. He's a Shawnee chief. There he goes through the willows!\"    By this time Jim and Mr. Wells, Mrs. Wentz and the girls had joined  the group. They all watched Silvertip get into his canoe and paddle  away.    \"A bad sign,\" said Wentz, and then, turning to Jeff Lynn, who joined  the party at that moment, he briefly explained the circumstances.    \"Never did like Silver. He's a crafty redskin, an' not to be  trusted,\" replied Jeff.    \"He has turned round and is looking back,\" Nell said quickly.    \"So he has,\" observed the fur-trader.    The Indian was now several hundred yards down the swift river, and  for an instant had ceased paddling. The sun shone brightly on his  eagle plumes. He remained motionless for a moment, and even at such  a distance the dark, changeless face could be discerned. He lifted  his hand and shook it menacingly.    \"If ye don't hear from that redskin ag'in Jeff Lynn don't know  nothin',\" calmly said the old frontiersman.        Chapter IV.    As the rafts drifted with the current the voyagers saw the settlers  on the landing-place diminish until they had faded from indistinct  figures to mere black specks against the green background. Then came  the last wave of a white scarf, faintly in the distance, and at  length the dark outline of the fort was all that remained to their  regretful gaze. Quickly that, too, disappeared behind the green  hill, which, with its bold front, forces the river to take a wide  turn.    The Ohio, winding in its course between high, wooded bluffs, rolled  on and on into the wilderness.    Beautiful as was the ever-changing scenery, rugged gray-faced cliffs  on one side contrasting with green-clad hills on the other, there  hovered over land and water something more striking than beauty.  Above all hung a still atmosphere of calmness--of loneliness.    And this penetrating solitude marred somewhat the pleasure which  might have been found in the picturesque scenery, and caused the  voyagers, to whom this country was new, to take less interest in the  gaily-feathered birds and stealthy animals that were to be seen on  the way. By the forms of wild life along the banks of the river,  this strange intruder on their peace was regarded with attention.  The birds and beasts evinced little fear of the floating rafts. The  sandhill crane, stalking along the shore, lifted his long neck as  the unfamiliar thing came floating by, and then stood still and  silent as a statue until the rafts disappeared from view.  Blue-herons feeding along the bars, saw the unusual spectacle, and,  uttering surprised \"booms,\" they spread wide wings and lumbered away  along the shore. The crows circled above the voyagers, cawing in not  unfriendly excitement. Smaller birds alighted on the raised poles,  and several--a robin, a catbird and a little brown wren--ventured  with hesitating boldness to peck at the crumbs the girls threw to  them. Deer waded knee-deep in the shallow water, and, lifting their  heads, instantly became motionless and absorbed. Occasionally a  buffalo appeared on a level stretch of bank, and, tossing his huge  head, seemed inclined to resent the coming of this stranger into his  domain.    All day the rafts drifted steadily and swiftly down the river,  presenting to the little party ever-varying pictures of densely  wooded hills, of jutting, broken cliffs with scant evergreen growth;  of long reaches of sandy bar that glistened golden in the sunlight,  and over all the flight and call of wildfowl, the flitting of  woodland songsters, and now and then the whistle and bellow of the  horned watchers in the forest.    The intense blue of the vault above began to pale, and low down in  the west a few fleecy clouds, gorgeously golden for a fleeting  instant, then crimson-crowned for another, shaded and darkened as  the setting sun sank behind the hills. Presently the red rays  disappeared, a pink glow suffused the heavens, and at last, as gray  twilight stole down over the hill-tops, the crescent moon peeped  above the wooded fringe of the western bluffs.    \"Hard an' fast she is,\" sang out Jeff Lynn, as he fastened the rope  to a tree at the head of a small island. \"All off now, and' we'll  hev' supper. Thar's a fine spring under yon curly birch, an' I  fetched along a leg of deer-meat. Hungry, little 'un?\"    He had worked hard all day steering "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12400"],[0,"Bismarck and the Foundation of the German Empire (#5)"],[1,"d. He had to some  extent prepared himself for the work by attending lectures at a newly  founded agricultural college in the outskirts of Greifswald. The  management of the estate seems to have been successful; the two brothers  started on their work with no capital and no experience, but after  three or four years by constant attention and hard work they had put the  affairs in a satisfactory state. In 1841, a division was made; Otto had  wished this to be done before, as he found that he spent a good deal  more money than his brother and was gaining an unfair advantage in the  common household; from this time he took over Kniephof, and there he  lived for the next four years, while his brother took up his abode four  miles off at Kulz, where he lived till his death in 1895. Otto had not  indeed given up the habits he had learnt at Goettingen; his wild freaks,  his noisy entertainments, were the talk of the countryside; the beverage  which he has made classical, a mixture of beer and champagne, was the  common drink, and he was known far and wide as the mad Bismarck. These  acts of wildness were, however, only a small part of his life; he  entered as a lieutenant of Landwehr in the cavalry and thereby became  acquainted with another form of military service. It was while he was at  the annual training that he had an opportunity of shewing his physical  strength and courage. A groom, who was watering horses in the river, was  swept away by the current; Bismarck, who was standing on a bridge  watching them, at once leaped into the river, in full uniform as he was,  and with great danger to himself saved the drowning man. For this he  received a medal for saving life. He astonished his friends by the  amount and variety of his reading; it was at this time that he studied  Spinoza. It is said that he had among his friends the reputation of  being a liberal; it is probable enough that he said and did many things  which they did not understand; and anything they did not understand  would be attributed to liberalism by the country gentlemen of Pomerania;  partly no doubt it was due to the fact that in 1843 he came back from  Paris wearing a beard. We can see, however, that he was restless and  discontented; he felt in himself the possession of powers which were not  being used; there was in his nature also a morbid restlessness, a  dissatisfaction with himself which he tried to still but only increased  by his wild excesses. As his affairs became more settled he travelled;  one year he went to London, another to Paris; of his visit to England we  have an interesting account in a letter to his father. He landed in  Hull[2], thence he went to Scarborough and York, where he was hospitably  received by the officers of the Hussars; \"although I did not know any of  them, they asked me to dinner and shewed me everything\"; from York he  went to Manchester, where he saw some of the factories.      \"Generally speaking I cannot praise too highly the extraordinary    courtesy and kindness of English people, which far surpass what I    had expected; even the poor people are pleasant, very unassuming,    and easy to get on with when one talks to them. Those who come    much into intercourse with strangers--cab-drivers, porters,    etc.--naturally have a tendency to extortion, but soon give in    when they see that one understands the language and customs and    is determined not to be put upon. Generally I find the life much    cheaper than I expected.\"    In 1844, his sister, to whom he was passionately devoted, was married to  an old friend, Oscar von Arnim. Never did an elder brother write to his  young sister more delightful letters than those which she received from  him; from them we get a pleasant picture of his life at this time.  Directly after the wedding, when he was staying with his father at  Schoenhausen, he writes:      \"Just now I am living here with my father, reading, smoking, and    walking; I help him to eat lamperns and sometimes play a comedy    with him which it pleases him to call fox-hunting. We start out    in heavy rain, or perhaps with 10 degrees of frost, with Ihle,    Ellin, and Karl; then in perfect silence we surround a clump of    firs with the most sportsmanlike precautions, carefully observing    the wind, although we all, and probably father as well, are    absolutely convinced that there is not a living creature in it    except one or two old women gathering firewood. Then Ihle, Karl,    and the two dogs make their way through the cover, emitting the    most strange and horrible sounds, especially Ihle; father stands    there motionless and on the alert with his gun cocked, just as    though he really expected to see something. Ihle comes out just    in front of him, shouting 'Hoo lala, hey heay, hold him, hie,    hie,' in the strangest and most astonishing manner. Then father    asks me if I have seen nothing, and I with the most natural tone    of astonishment that I can command, answer 'No, nothing at all.'    Then after abusing the weather we start off to another wood,    while Ihle with a confidence that he assumes in the most natural    manner praises its wealth in game, and there we play over the    game again _dal segno_. So it goes on for three or four hours;    father's, Ihle's, and Fingal's passion does not seem to cool for    a moment. Besides that, we look at the orange house twice a day    and the sheep once a day, observe the four thermometers in the    room once every hour, set the weather-glass, and, since the    weather has been fine, have set all the clocks by the sun and    adjusted them so closely that the clock in the dining-room is the    only one which ever gives a sound after the others have struck.    Charles V. was a stupid fellow. You will understand that with so    multifarious an occupation I have little time left to call on the    clergymen; as they have no vote for the election it was quite    impossible.      \"The Elbe is full of ice, the wind E.S.E., the latest thermometer    from Berlin shews 8 degrees, the barometer is rising and at 8.28.    I tell you this as an example how in your letters you might write    to father more the small events of your life; they amuse him    immensely; tell him who has been to see you, whom you have been    calling on, what you had for dinner, how the horses are, how the    servants behave, if the doors creak and the windows are firm--in    short, facts and events. Besides this, he does not like to be    called papa, he dislikes the expression. _Avis au lecteur_.\"    On another occasion he says:      \"Only with difficulty can I resist the temptation of filling a    whole letter with agricultural lamentations over frosts, sick    cattle, bad reap, bad roads, dead lambs, hungry sheep, want of    straw, fodder, money, potatoes, and manure; outside Johann is    persistently whistling a wretched schottische out of tune, and I    have not the cruelty to interrupt it, for he seeks to still by    music his violent love-sickness.\"    Then we have long letters from Nordeney, where he delighted in the sea,  but space will not allow us to quote more. It is only in these letters,  and in those which he wrote in later years to his wife, that we see the  natural kindliness and simplicity of his disposition, his love of  nature, and his great power of description. There have been few better  letter-writers in Germany or any other country.    His ability and success as an agriculturist made a deep impression on  his neighbours. As years went on he became much occupied in local  business; he was appointed as the representative of his brother, who was  Landrath for the district; in 1845 he was elected one of the members for  the Provincial Diet of Pomerania. He also had a seat in the Diet for the  Saxon province in which Schoenhausen was situated. These local Diets  were the only form of representative government which existed in the  rural districts; they had little power, but their opinion was asked on  new projects of law, and they were officially regarded as an efficient  substitute for a common Prussian Parliament. Many of his friends,  including his brother, urged him again to enter the public service, for  which they considered he was especially adapted; he might have had the  post of Royal Commissioner for Improvements in East Prussia.    He did make one attempt to resume his official career. At the beginning  of 1844 he returned to Potsdam and took up his duties as Referendar,  but not for long; he seems to have quarrelled with his superior. The  story is that he called one day to ask for leave of absence; his chief  kept him waiting an hour in the anteroom, and when he was admitted asked  him curtly, \"What do you want?\" Bismarck at once answered, \"I came to  ask for leave of absence, but now I wish for permission to send in my  resignation.\" He was clearly deficient in that subservience and ready  obedience to authority which was the best passport to promotion in the  Civil Service; there was in his disposition already a certain truculence  and impatience. From this time he nourished a bitter hatred of the  Prussian bureaucracy.    This did not, however, prevent him carrying out his public duties as a  landed proprietor. In 1846 we find him taking much interest in proposals  for improving the management of the manorial courts; he wished to see  them altered so as to give something of the advantages of the English  system; he regrets the \"want of corporate spirit and public feeling in  our corn-growing aristocracy\"; \"it is unfortunately difficult among most  of the gentlemen to awake any other idea under the words 'patrimonial  power' but the calculation whether the fee will cover the expenses.\" We  can easily understand that the man who wrote this would be called a  liberal by many of his neighbours; what he wanted, however, was a reform  which would give life, permanency, and independence to an institution  which like everything"]]]
