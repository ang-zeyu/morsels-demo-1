Monsieur Ude, who is, unquestionably, the prince of gastronomers, has  just published the tenth edition of his _French Cook_, of which, line  upon line, we may say, _Decies repelita placebit_; and Jarrin, the  celebrated _artiste en sucre_, has also revised his _Italian  Confectioner_, in a fourth edition. We should think both these works  must be the literary furniture of every good kitchen, or they ought  to be; for there is just enough of the science in them to make them  extremely useful, whilst all must allow them to be entertaining.    A few years ago, Mrs. Glasse ruled the roast of cookery, and not a  stew was made without consulting her invaluable book. Whilst we were  embroiled in war, her instructions were standing orders, but with the  peace came a host of foreign luxuries and fashions, among these,  _Cookery from France_. Hence the French system became introduced into  the establishments of the wealthy of this country, to which may be  attributed the sale of nine editions of M. Ude's work; for it is  strictly what it professes to be, \"A System of Fashionable and  Economical Cookery, adapted to the use of English Families.\" The tenth  edition, before us, is a bulky _tome_ of about 500 pages, with an  appendix of observations on the meals of the day; mode of giving suppers  at Routs and soirees, as practised when the author was in the employ of  Lord Sefton; and above all, a brief history of the rise and progress of  Cookery, from an admirable French treatise. This is literally the _sauce  piquante_ of the volume, and we serve a little to our readers:--    It appears that the science of Cookery was in a very inferior state  under the first and second race of the French kings. Gregory of Tours  has preserved the account of a repast of French warriors, at which,  in this refined age, we should be absolutely astounded. According to  Eginhard, Charlemagne lived poorly, and ate but little--however, this  trait of resemblance in Charlemagne and Napoleon, the modern Eginhards  have forgotten in their comparison of these two great men. Philippe le  Bel was hardly half an hour at table, and Francis I. thought more of  women than of eating and drinking; nevertheless, it was under this  gallant monarch that the science of gastronomy took rise in France.    Few have heard the name of Gonthier d'Andernach. What Bacon was to  philosophy, Dante and Petrarch to poetry, Michael Angelo and Raphael  to painting, Columbus and Gama to geography, Copernicus and Galileo to  astronomy, Gonthier was in France to the art of cookery. Before him,  their code of eating was formed only of loose scraps picked up here and  there; the names of dishes were strange and barbarous, like the dishes  themselves.    Gonthier is the father of cookery, as Descartes, of French philosophy.  It is said that Gonthier, in less than ten years, invented seven  cullises, nine ragouts, thirty-one sauces, and twenty-one soups.    A woman opened the gates of an enlightened age; it was Catherine, the  daughter of the celebrated Lorenzo de Medici, niece of Leo the Tenth,  then in all the bloom of beauty. Accompanied by a troop of perfumers,  painters, astrologers, poets, and cooks, she crossed the Alps, and  whilst Bullan planned the Tuileries, Berini recovered from oblivion  those sauces which, for many ages, had been lost. Endowed with all the  gifts of fortune, the mother and the wife of kings, nature had also  gifted her with a palate, whose intuitive sensibility seldom falls to  the lot of sovereigns. In consequence of which, after having driven  before her this troop of male and female soothsayers, who pretended to  foretel the future, she consulted her _maitre d'hotel_, about some roast  meat brought from luxurious Florence; and dipped in a rich sauce the  same hand that held the reins of the empire, and which Roussard compared  to the rosy fingers of Aurora! Let the foolish vulgar laugh at the  importance which the queen-mother seems to place in the art of cooking;  but they have not considered that it is at table, in the midst of the  fumes of Burgundy, and the savoury odour of rich dishes, that she  meditated the means of quelling a dangerous faction, or the destruction  of a man, who disturbed her repose. It was during dinner she had an  interview with the Duke of Alba, with whom she resolved on the massacre  of St. Bartholomew.    Not long after the massacre of St. Bartholomew the throne was occupied  by Henry de Valois, brother to Charles the Ninth, and son of Catherine.  He was a prince of good appetite, a lover of wine and good cheer,  qualities which his mother had carefully fostered and cultivated, that  she alone might hold the reigns of government. Henry de Valois spent  whole days at table, and the constellations of the kitchen shone with  the greatest splendour under this gourmand king. We date from the  beginning of his reign the invention of the fricandeau, generally  attributed to a Swiss. Now the fricandeau having its Columbus, its  discovery appears not more wonderful than that of America, and yet  it required _une grande force de tete_.    Though we acknowledge the immense influence this monarch had over  cookery, we must not conceal that he brought in fashion aromatic sauces,  tough macaroni, cullises, and brown sauces calcined by a process like  that of roasted coffee. These sauces gave the dishes a corrosive  acidity, and as Jourdan le Cointe remarks, far from nourishing the body,  communicated to it a feverish sensation, which baffled all the skill of  physicians, in their attempts to cure it. They were positive poisons  which the Italians had introduced into France, a taste for which spread  through every class of society.    Under the reign of Henry III. a taste for warm drinks was joined to  that of spicy dishes. Hippocrates recommends hot water in fevers,  Avicenna in consumption, Trallien in phrensy, Plato in loathings, Aetius  in strangury,--whence we conclude that warm water, having so many  different qualities, must have been a very useful article at table, had  it only been to assist digestion, considering that people ate copiously  in the reign of the Valois. They made not one single repast without a  jug full of hot water, and even wine was drunk lukewarm.    If the poor have preserved the memory of Henry IV., we cannot say as  much of his cooks. That monarch did nothing for them;--either Nature  had not endowed him with a good appetite, (for what prince ever was  perfect,) or he looked upon them, as, in the last century, we looked  upon soups, as things of hardly any use; but in return they also did  nothing for him.    It is very remarkable, that in France, where there is but one religion,  the sauces are infinitely varied, whilst in England, where the different  sects are innumerable, there is, we may say, but one single sauce.  Melted butter, in English cookery, plays nearly the same part as the  Lord Mayor's coach at civic ceremonies, calomel in modern medicine, or  silver forks in the fashionable novels. Melted butter and anchovies,  melted butter and capers, melted butter and parsley, melted butter and  eggs, and melted butter for ever: this is a sample of the national  cookery of this country. We may date the art of making sauces from the  age of Louis XIV. Under Louis XIII. meat was either roasted or broiled:  every baker had a stove where the citizen, as well as the great lord,  sent his meat to be dressed; but, by degrees, they began to feel the  necessity of sauces.    It appears that the great wits of the age of Louis XIV. had not that  contempt for cookery which some idealists of our days affect to have.  Boileau has described a bad repast like a man who has often seen better;  he liked the pleasures of the table, which have never been incompatible  with the gifts of genius, or the investigations of the understanding. \"I  cannot conceive,\" says Doctor Johnson, \"the folly of those, who, when at  table, think of every thing but eating; for my part, when I am there I  think of nothing else; and whosoever does not trouble himself with this  important affair at dinner, or supper, will do no good at any other  time.\" Boswell affirms that he never knew a man who dispatched a dinner  better than the great moralist. But what avails it to defend cooks and  gourmands? It is an axiom in political economy, according to Malthus,  that _he who makes two blades of grass grow, where before there was but  one, ought to be considered as the benefactor of his country, and of  mankind_. Is not this a service which the epicure and the cook every day  do their country? Addison thought differently from Johnson on this  subject: \"Every time,\" says he, \"that I see a splendid dinner, I fancy  fever, gout, and dropsy, are lying in ambush for me, with the whole race  of maladies which attack mankind: in my opinion an epicure is a fool.\"  What does this blustering of Addison prove? Boswell also asserts, that  Addison often complained of indigestion. And in the present times, the  first chemist of the day, Sir Humphry Davy, passes for a finished  gourmand.    Roasting, boiling, frying, broiling, do not alone constitute the arc of  cooking, otherwise the savage of the Oronoco might be _maitre d'hotel_  with Prince Esterhazy.    The science of gastronomy made great progress under Louis XV., a  brilliant epoch for the literature of gastronomy: together with the  fashions, customs, freedom of opinion, and taste for equipages and  horses brought from Great Britain--some new dishes taken from the  culinary code of this country, such as puddings and beef-steaks, were  also introduced into France. Thanks to the increasing progress and  discoveries in chemistry, and to the genius of our artists, the art of  cookery rose to the greatest height towards the end of the last century.  What a famous age was that of Mezelier, l'Asne, Jouvent, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1149"],[0,"From London to Land's End (#5)"],[1,"the  prebendaries, canons, and other dignitaries of this church.  The Deanery  is a very pleasant dwelling, the gardens very large, and the river  running through them; but the floods in winter sometimes incommode the  gardens very much.    This school has fully answered the end of the founder, who, though he was  no great scholar, resolved to erect a house for the making the ages to  come more learned than those that went before; and it has, I say, fully  answered the end, for many learned and great men have been raised here,  some of whom we shall have occasion to mention as we go on.    Among the many private inscriptions in this church, we found one made by  Dr. Over, once an eminent physician in this city, on a mother and child,  who, being his patients, died together and were buried in the same grave,  and which intimate that one died of a fever, and the other of a dropsy:       \"Surrepuit natum Febris, matrem abstulit Hydrops,     Igne Prior Fatis, Altera cepit Aqua.\"    As the city itself stands in a vale on the bank, and at the conjunction  of two small rivers, so the country rising every way, but just as the  course of the water keeps the valley open, you must necessarily, as you  go out of the gates, go uphill every way; but when once ascended, you  come to the most charming plains and most pleasant country of that kind  in England; which continues with very small intersections of rivers and  valleys for above fifty miles, as shall appear in the sequel of this  journey.    At the west gate of this city was anciently a castle, known to be so by  the ruins more than by any extraordinary notice taken of it in history.  What they say of it, that the Saxon kings kept their court here, is  doubtful, and must be meant of the West Saxons only.  And as to the tale  of King Arthur's Round Table, which they pretend was kept here for him  and his two dozen of knights (which table hangs up still, as a piece of  antiquity to the tune of twelve hundred years, and has, as they pretend,  the names of the said knights in Saxon characters, and yet such as no man  can read), all this story I see so little ground to give the least credit  to that I look upon it, and it shall please you, to be no better than a  fib.    Where this castle stood, or whatever else it was (for some say there was  no castle there), the late King Charles II. marked out a very noble  design, which, had he lived, would certainly have made that part of the  country the Newmarket of the ages to come; for the country hereabout far  excels that of Newmarket Heath for all kinds of sport and diversion fit  for a prince, nobody can dispute.  And as the design included a noble  palace (sufficient, like Windsor, for a summer residence of the whole  court), it would certainly have diverted the king from his cursory  journeys to Newmarket.    The plan of this house has received several alterations, and as it is  never like to be finished, it is scarce worth recording the variety.  The  building is begun, and the front next the city carried up to the roof and  covered, but the remainder is not begun.  There was a street of houses  designed from the gate of the palace down to the town, but it was never  begun to be built; the park marked out was exceeding large, near ten  miles in circumference, and ended west upon the open Downs, in view of  the town of Stockbridge.    This house was afterwards settled, with a royal revenue also, as an  appanage (established by Parliament) upon Prince George of Denmark for  his life, in case he had out-lived the queen; but his Royal Highness  dying before her Majesty, all hope of seeing this design perfected, or  the house finished, is now vanished.    I cannot omit that there are several public edifices in this city and in  the neighbourhood, as the hospitals and the building adjoining near the  east gate; and towards the north a piece of an old monastery  undemolished, and which is still preserved to the religion, being the  residence of some private Roman Catholic gentlemen, where they have an  oratory, and, as they say, live still according to the rules of St.  Benedict.  This building is called Hide House; and as they live very  usefully, and to the highest degree obliging among their neighbours, they  meet with no obstruction or disturbance from anybody.    Winchester is a place of no trade other than is naturally occasioned by  the inhabitants of the city and neighbouring villages one with another.  Here is no manufacture, no navigation; there was indeed an attempt to  make the river navigable from Southampton, and it was once made  practicable, but it never answered the expense so as to give  encouragement to the undertakers.    Here is a great deal of good company, and abundance of gentry being in  the neighbourhood, it adds to the sociableness of the place.  The clergy  also here are, generally speaking, very rich and very numerous.    As there is such good company, so they are gotten into that new-fashioned  way of conversing by assemblies.  I shall do no more than mention them  here; they are pleasant and agreeable to the young peoples, and sometimes  fatal to them, of which, in its place, Winchester has its share of the  mirth.  May it escape the ill-consequences!    The hospital on the south of this city, at a mile distant on the road to  Southampton, is worth notice.  It is said to be founded by King William  Rufus, but was not endowed or appointed till later times by Cardinal  Beaufort.  Every traveller that knocks at the door of this house in his  way, and asks for it, claims the relief of a piece of white bread and a  cup of beer, and this donation is still continued.  A quantity of good  beer is set apart every day to be given away, and what is left is  distributed to other poor, but none of it kept to the next day.    How the revenues of this hospital, which should maintain the master and  thirty private gentlemen (whom they call Fellows, but ought to call  Brothers), is now reduced to maintain only fourteen, while the master  lives in a figure equal to the best gentleman in the country, would be  well worth the inquiry of a proper visitor, if such can be named.  It is  a thing worthy of complaint when public charities, designed for the  relief of the poor, are embezzled and depredated by the rich, and turned  to the support of luxury and pride.    From Winchester is about twenty-five miles, and over the most charming  plains that can anywhere be seen (far, in my opinion, excelling the  plains of Mecca), we come to Salisbury.  The vast flocks of sheep which  one everywhere sees upon these Downs, and the great number of those  flocks, is a sight truly worth observation; it is ordinary for these  flocks to contain from three thousand to five thousand in a flock, and  several private farmers hereabouts have two or three such flocks.    But it is more remarkable still how a great part of these Downs comes, by  a new method of husbandry, to be not only made arable (which they never  were in former days), but to bear excellent wheat, and great crops, too,  though otherwise poor barren land, and never known to our ancestors to be  capable of any such thing--nay, they would perhaps have laughed at any  one that would have gone about to plough up the wild downs and hills  where the sheep were wont to go.  But experience has made the present age  wiser and more skilful in husbandry; for by only folding the sheep upon  the ploughed lands--those lands which otherwise are barren, and where the  plough goes within three or four inches of the solid rock of chalk, are  made fruitful and bear very good wheat, as well as rye and barley.  I  shall say more of this when I come to speak of the same practice farther  in the country.    This plain country continues in length from Winchester to Salisbury  (twenty-five miles), from thence to Dorchester (twenty-two miles), thence  to Weymouth (six miles); so that they lie near fifty miles in length and  breadth; they reach also in some places thirty-five to forty miles.  They  who would make any practicable guess at the number of sheep usually fed  on these Downs may take it from a calculation made, as I was told, at  Dorchester, that there were six hundred thousand sheep fed within six  miles of that town, measuring every way round and the town in the centre.    As we passed this plain country, we saw a great many old camps, as well  Roman as British, and several remains of the ancient inhabitants of this  kingdom, and of their wars, battles, entrenchments, encampments,  buildings, and other fortifications, which are indeed very agreeable to a  traveller that has read anything of the history of the country.  Old  Sarum is as remarkable as any of these, where there is a double  entrenchment, with a deep graff or ditch to either of them; the area  about one hundred yards in diameter, taking in the whole crown of the  hill, and thereby rendering the ascent very difficult.  Near this there  is one farm-house, which is all the remains I could see of any town in or  near the place (for the encampment has no resemblance of a town), and yet  this is called the borough of Old Sarum, and sends two members to  Parliament.  Whom those members can justly say they represent would be  hard for them to answer.    Some will have it that the old city of _Sorbiodunum_ or Salisbury stood  here, and was afterwards (for I know not what reasons) removed to the low  marshy grounds among the rivers, where it now stands.  But as I see no  authority for it other than mere tradition, I believe my share of it, and  take it _ad referendum_.    Salisbury itself is indeed a large and pleasant city, though I do not  think it at all the pleasanter for that which they boast so much  of--namely, the water running through the middle of every street--or that  it adds anything to the beauty of the place, but just the contrary; it  keeps the streets always dirty, full of wet and filth and weeds, even in  the"]]]
