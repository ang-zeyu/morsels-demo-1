In Fig 2 the shaft has turned through one-eighth of a revolution; in  Fig. 3, a quarter turn; Fig. 4, three-eighths of a turn. Another eighth  turn brings two parts into position represented by Fig. 1, except the  second pair of cylinders now replace the first pair. The bearings, KL,  support the two shafts and act as stationary valves, against which faces  formed on the cylinders revolve; steam and exhaust ports are provided in  the faces of K and L, and two ports in the revolving faces, one to each  cylinder. The point at which steam is cut off is determined by the  length of the admission ports in K and L. The exhaust port is made of  such a length that steam may escape from the cylinders during the whole  of the return stroke of pistons.    Fig. 5 shows the complete engine. It will be seen that the engine is  entirely incased in a box frame, with, however, a lid for ready access  to the parts for examination, one great advantage being that the engine  can be worked with the cover removed, thus enabling any leakage past the  pistons or valve faces to be at once detected. The casing also serves to  retain a certain amount of lubricant.    The lubrication is effected by means of a triple sight-feed lubricator,  one feeder delivering to steam inlet, and two serving the main shaft  bearings.    Figs, 6 and 7 are an end elevation and plan of the same engine. There is  nothing in the other details calling for special notice.    Figs. 8 and 9 show the method of machining the cylinders and pistons,  the whole of which can be done by ordinary lathes, which is evidently a  great advantage in the event of reboring, etc., being required in the  colonies or other countries where special tools are inaccessible.

While Englishmen and Americans have been alike interested in the late  project for forcing water by a pipe line over the mountainous region  lying between Suakim and Berber in the far-off Soudan, few men of either  nation have any proper conception of the vast expenditure of capital,  natural and engineering difficulties overcome, and the bold and  successful enterprise which has brought into existence far greater pipe  lines in our own Atlantic States. We refer to the lines of the National  Transit Company, which have for a purpose the economic transportation of  crude petroleum from Western Pennsylvania to the sea coast at New York,  Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and to the Lakes at Cleveland and Buffalo.    To properly commence our sketch of this truly gigantic enterprise, we  must go back to the discovery of petroleum in the existing oil regions  of Pennsylvania and adjacent States. Its presence as an oily scum on the  surface of ponds and streams had long been known, and among the Indians  this \"rock-oil\" was highly appreciated as a vehicle for mixing their wax  paint, and for anointing their bodies; in later years it was gathered in  a rude way by soaking it up in blankets, and sold at a high price for  medicinal purposes only, under the name of Seneca rock oil, Genesee oil,  Indian oil, etc.    But the date of its discovery as an important factor in the useful arts  and as a source of enormous national wealth was about 1854. In the year  named a certain Mr. George H. Bissell of New Orleans accidentally met  with a sample of the \"Seneca Oil,\" and being convinced that it had a  value far beyond that usually accorded it, associated himself with  some friends and leased for 99 years some of the best oil springs near  Titusville, Pa. This lease cost the company $5,000, although only a few  years before a cow had been considered a full equivalent in value for  the same land. The original prospectors began operations by digging  collecting ditches, and then pumping off the oil which gathered upon the  surface of the water. But not long after this first crude attempt at oil  gathering, the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co. was organized, with Prof. B.  Silliman of Yale College as its president, and a more intelligent method  was introduced into the development of the oil-producing formation. In  1858, Col. Drake of New Haven was employed by the Pennsylvania Co. to  sink an artesian well; and, after considerable preparatory work, on  August 28, 1859, the first oil vein was tapped at a depth of 691/2 feet  below the surface; the flow was at first 10 barrels per day, but in the  following September this increased to 40 barrels daily.    [Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE NATIONAL TRANSIT CO.'S PIPE LINES.]    The popular excitement and the fortunes made and lost in the years  following the sinking of the initial well are a matter of history,  with which we have here nothing to do. It is sufficient to say that a  multitude of adventurers were drawn by the \"oil-craze\" into this late  wilderness, and the sinking of wells extended with unprecedented  rapidity over the region near Titusville and from there into more  distant fields.    By June 1, 1862, 495 wells had been put down near Titusville, and the  daily output of oil was nearly 6,000 barrels, selling at the wells  at from $4.00 to $6.00 per barrel. But the tapping of this vast  subterranean storehouse of oleaginous wealth continued, until the  estimated annual production was swelled from 82,000 barrels in 1859 to  24,385,966 barrels in 1883; in the latter year 2,949 wells were put  down, many of them, however, being simply dry holes.[1] The total output  of oil in the Pennsylvania regions, between 1859 and 1883, is estimated  at about 234,800,000 barrels--enough oil to fill a tank about 10,000  feet square, nearly two miles to a side, to a depth of over 131/2 feet.    [Footnote 1: The total number of wells in the Pennsylvania oil regions  cannot be given. In the years 1876-1884, inclusive, 28,619 wells were  sunk; this is an average of 3,179 per year. During the same period 2,507  dry holes were drilled at an average cost of $1,500 each.]    As long as oil could be sold at the wells at from $4.00 to $10.00  a barrel, the cost of transportation was an item hardly worthy of  consideration, and railroad companies multiplied and waged a bitter  war with each other in their scramble after the traffic. But as the  production increased with rapid strides, the market price of oil fell  with a corresponding rapidity, until the quotations for 1884 show  figures as low as 50 to 60 cents per barrel for the crude product at Oil  City.    In December, 1865, the freight charge per barrel for a carload of oil  from Titusville to New York, and the return of the empty barrels,  was $3.50.[1] To this figure was added the cost of transportation by  pipe-line from Pithole to Titusville, $1.00; cost of barreling, 25  cents; freight to Corry, Pa., 80 cents; making the total cost of a  barrel of crude oil in New York, $5.55. In January, 1866, the barrel  of oil in New York cost $10.40, including in this figure, however, the  Government tax of $1.00 and the price of the barrel, $3.25.    [Footnote 1: It is stated that in 1862 the cost of sending one barrel of  oil to New York was $7.45. Steamboats charged $2.00 per barrel from Oil  City to Pittsburg, and the hauling from Oil Creek to Meadville cost  $2.25 per barrel.]    The question of reducing these enormous transportation charges was first  broached, apparently, in 1864, when a writer in the _North American_,  of Philadelphia, outlined a scheme for laying a pipe-line down the  Allegheny River to Pittsburg. This project was violently assailed by  both the transportation companies and the people of the oil region,  who feared that its success would interfere with their then great  prosperity. But short pipe-lines, connecting the wells with storage  tanks and shipping points, grew apace and prepared the way for the vast  network of the present day, which covers this region and throws out arms  to the ocean and the lakes.    Among the very first, if not the first, pipe lines laid was one put down  between the Sherman well and the railway terminus on the Miller farm.  It was about 3 miles long, and designed by a Mr. Hutchinson; he had an  exaggerated idea of the pressure to be exercised, and at intervals of 50  to 100 feet he set up air chambers 10 inches in diameter. The weak point  in this line, however, proved to be the joints; the pipes were of cast  iron, and the joint-leakage was so great that little, if any, oil ever  reached the end of the line, and the scheme was abandoned in despair.    In connection with this question of oil transportation, a sketch of the  various methods, other than pipelines, adopted in Pennsylvania may not  be out of place. We are mainly indebted to Mr. S.F. Peckham, in his  article on \"Petroleum and its Products\" in the U. S. Census Report of  1880, for the information relating to tank-cars immediately following:    Originally the oil was carried in 40 and 42 gallon barrels, made of oak  and hooped with iron; early in 1866, or possibly in 1865, tank-cars  were introduced. These were at first ordinary flat-cars upon which were  placed two wooden tanks, shaped like tubs, each holding about 2,000  gallons.    On the rivers, bulk barges were also, after a time, introduced on the  Ohio and Allegheny; at first these were rude affairs, and often of  inadequate strength; but as now built they are 130 x 22 x 16 feet, in  their general dimensions, and divided into eight compartments, with  water-tight bulkheads; they hold about 2,200 barrels.    In 1871 iron-tank cars superseded those of wood, with tanks of varying  sizes, ranging from 3,856 to 5,000 gallons each. These tanks were  cylinders, 24 feet 6 inches long, and 66 inches in diameter, and weighed  about 4,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (#4)"],[1,"speak presently--the principal test of recognition, at all  events between strangers, and when the question is, not as to the  individual, but as to the class.  What therefore \"introduction\" is  among the higher classes in Spaceland, that the process of \"feeling\" is  with us.  \"Permit me to ask you to feel and be felt by my friend Mr.  So-and-so\"--is still, among the more old-fashioned of our country  gentlemen in districts remote from towns, the customary formula for a  Flatland introduction.  But in the towns, and among men of business,  the words \"be felt by\" are omitted and the sentence is abbreviated to,  \"Let me ask you to feel Mr. So-and-so\"; although it is assumed, of  course, that the \"feeling\" is to be reciprocal.  Among our still more  modern and dashing young gentlemen--who are extremely averse to  superfluous effort and supremely indifferent to the purity of their  native language--the formula is still further curtailed by the use of  \"to feel\" in a technical sense, meaning, \"to  recommend-for-the-purposes-of-feeling-and-being-felt\"; and at this  moment the \"slang\" of polite or fast society in the upper classes  sanctions such a barbarism as \"Mr. Smith, permit me to feel Mr. Jones.\"    Let not my Reader however suppose that \"feeling\" is with us the tedious  process that it would be with you, or that we find it necessary to feel  right round all the sides of every individual before we determine the  class to which he belongs.  Long practice and training, begun in the  schools and continued in the experience of daily life, enable us to  discriminate at once by the sense of touch, between the angles of an  equal-sided Triangle, Square, and Pentagon; and I need not say that the  brainless vertex of an acute-angled Isosceles is obvious to the dullest  touch.  It is therefore not necessary, as a rule, to do more than feel  a single angle of an individual; and this, once ascertained, tells us  the class of the person whom we are addressing, unless indeed he  belongs to the higher sections of the nobility.  There the difficulty  is much greater.  Even a Master of Arts in our University of Wentbridge  has been known to confuse a ten-sided with a twelve-sided Polygon; and  there is hardly a Doctor of Science in or out of that famous University  who could pretend to decide promptly and unhesitatingly between a  twenty-sided and a twenty-four sided member of the Aristocracy.    Those of my readers who recall the extracts I gave above from the  Legislative code concerning Women, will readily perceive that the  process of introduction by contact requires some care and discretion.  Otherwise the angles might inflict on the unwary Feeling irreparable  injury.  It is essential for the safety of the Feeler that the Felt  should stand perfectly still.  A start, a fidgety shifting of the  position, yes, even a violent sneeze, has been known before now to  prove fatal to the incautious, and to nip in the bud many a promising  friendship.  Especially is this true among the lower classes of the  Triangles.  With them, the eye is situated so far from their vertex  that they can scarcely take cognizance of what goes on at that  extremity of their frame.  They are, moreover, of a rough coarse  nature, not sensitive to the delicate touch of the highly organized  Polygon.  What wonder then if an involuntary toss of the head has ere  now deprived the State of a valuable life!    I have heard that my excellent Grandfather--one of the least irregular  of his unhappy Isosceles class, who indeed obtained, shortly before his  decease, four out of seven votes from the Sanitary and Social Board for  passing him into the class of the Equal-sided--often deplored, with a  tear in his venerable eye, a miscarriage of this kind, which had  occurred to his great-great-great-Grandfather, a respectable Working  Man with an angle or brain of 59 degrees 30 minutes.  According to his  account, my unfortunately Ancestor, being afflicted with rheumatism,  and in the act of being felt by a Polygon, by one sudden start  accidentally transfixed the Great Man through the diagonal and thereby,  partly in consequence of his long imprisonment and degradation, and  partly because of the moral shock which pervaded the whole of my  Ancestor's relations, threw back our family a degree and a half in  their ascent towards better things.  The result was that in the next  generation the family brain was registered at only 58 degrees, and not  till the lapse of five generations was the lost ground recovered, the  full 60 degrees attained, and the Ascent from the Isosceles finally  achieved.  And all this series of calamities from one little accident  in the process of Feeling.    As this point I think I hear some of my better educated readers  exclaim, \"How could you in Flatland know anything about angles and  degrees, or minutes?  We SEE an angle, because we, in the region of  Space, can see two straight lines inclined to one another; but you, who  can see nothing but on straight line at a time, or at all events only a  number of bits of straight lines all in one straight line,--how can you  ever discern an angle, and much less register angles of different  sizes?\"    I answer that though we cannot SEE angles, we can INFER them, and this  with great precision.  Our sense of touch, stimulated by necessity, and  developed by long training, enables us to distinguish angles far more  accurately than your sense of sight, when unaided by a rule or measure  of angles.  Nor must I omit to explain that we have great natural  helps.  It is with us a Law of Nature that the brain of the Isosceles  class shall begin at half a degree, or thirty minutes, and shall  increase (if it increases at all) by half a degree in every generation  until the goal of 60 degrees is reached, when the condition of serfdom  is quitted, and the freeman enters the class of Regulars.    Consequently, Nature herself supplies us with an ascending scale or  Alphabet of angles for half a degree up to 60 degrees, Specimen of  which are placed in every Elementary School throughout the land.  Owing  to occasional retrogressions, to still more frequent moral and  intellectual stagnation, and to the extraordinary fecundity of the  Criminal and Vagabond classes, there is always a vast superfluity of  individuals of the half degree and single degree class, and a fair  abundance of Specimens up to 10 degrees.  These are absolutely  destitute of civil rights; and a great number of them, not having even  intelligence enough for the purposes of warfare, are devoted by the  States to the service of education.  Fettered immovably so as to remove  all possibility of danger, they are placed in the classrooms of our  Infant Schools, and there they are utilized by the Board of Education  for the purpose of imparting to the offspring of the Middle Classes the  tact and intelligence which these wretched creatures themselves are  utterly devoid.    In some States the Specimens are occasionally fed and suffered to exist  for several years; but in the more temperate and better regulated  regions, it is found in the long run more advantageous for the  educational interests of the young, to dispense with food, and to renew  the Specimens every month--which is about the average duration of the  foodless existence of the Criminal class.  In the cheaper schools, what  is gained by the longer existence of the Specimen is lost, partly in  the expenditure for food, and partly in the diminished accuracy of the  angles, which are impaired after a few weeks of constant \"feeling.\" Nor  must we forget to add, in enumerating the advantages of the more  expensive system, that it tends, though slightly yet perceptibly, to  the diminution of the redundant Isosceles population--an object which  every statesman in Flatland constantly keeps in view.  On the whole  therefore--although I am not ignorant that, in many popularly elected  School Boards, there is a reaction in favour of \"the cheap system\" as  it is called--I am myself disposed to think that this is one of the  many cases in which expense is the truest economy.    But I must not allow questions of School Board politics to divert me  from my subject.  Enough has been said, I trust, to shew that  Recognition by Feeling is not so tedious or indecisive a process as  might have been supposed; and it is obviously more trustworthy than  Recognition by hearing.  Still there remains, as has been pointed out  above, the objection that this method is not without danger.  For this  reason many in the Middle and Lower classes, and all without exception  in the Polygonal and Circular orders, prefer a third method, the  description of which shall be reserved for the next section.          SECTION 6  Of Recognition by Sight      I am about to appear very inconsistent.  In the previous sections I  have said that all figures in Flatland present the appearance of a  straight line; and it was added or implied, that it is consequently  impossible to distinguish by the visual organ between individuals of  different classes:  yet now I am about to explain to my Spaceland  critics how we are able to recognize one another by the sense of sight.    If however the Reader will take the trouble to refer to the passage in  which Recognition by Feeling is stated to be universal, he will find  this qualification--\"among the lower classes.\" It is only among the  higher classes and in our more temperate climates that Sight  Recognition is practised.    That this power exists in any regions and for any classes is the result  of Fog; which prevails during the greater part of the year in all parts  save the torrid zones.  That which is with you in Spaceland an unmixed  evil, blotting out the landscape, depressing the spirits, and  enfeebling the health, is by us recognized as a blessing scarcely  inferior to air itself, and as the Nurse of arts and Parent of  sciences.
