When plain tortoise-shell combs are defaced, the polish may be renewed  by rubbing them with pulverized rotten-stone and oil. The rotten-stone  should be sifted through muslin. It looks better to be rubbed on by  the hand. The jewellers afterwards polish them by rubbing them with  dry _rouge powder_; but sifted magnesia does just as well--and if the  ladies had rouge, perhaps they would, _by mistake_, put it upon their  cheeks, instead of their combs; and thereby spoil their complexions.  The best way to cleanse gold is, to wash it in warm suds made of  delicate soap, with ten or fifteen drops of _sal-volatile_ in it. This  makes jewels very brilliant.    Straw carpets should be washed in salt and water, and wiped with a  dry, coarse towel. They have a strong tendency to turn yellow; and  the salt prevents it. Moisture makes them decay soon; therefore they  should be kept thoroughly dry.    Rye paste is more adhesive than any other paste; because that grain is  very glutinous. It is much improved by adding a little pounded alum,  while it is boiling. This makes it almost as strong as glue.    Red ants are among the worst plagues that can infest a house. A lady  who had long been troubled with them, assured me she destroyed them in  a few days, after the following manner. She placed a dish of cracked  shagbarks (of which they are more fond than of anything else) in  the closet. They soon gathered upon it in troops. She then put some  corrosive sublimate in a cup; ordered the dish to be carried carefully  to the fire, and all its contents brushed in; while she swept the few  that dropped upon the shelf into the cup, and, with a feather, wet  all the cracks from whence they came, with corrosive sublimate. When  this had been repeated four or five times, the house was effectually  cleared. Too much care cannot be taken of corrosive sublimate,  especially when children are about. Many dreadful accidents have  happened in consequence of carelessness. Bottles which have contained  it should be broken, and buried; and cups should be boiled out in  ashes and water. If kept in the house, it should be hung up high, out  of reach, with POISON written upon it in large letters.    The neatest way to separate wax from honey-comb is to tie the comb  up in a linen or woollen bag; place it in a kettle of cold water, and  hang it over the fire. As the water heats, the wax melts, and rises to  the surface, while all the impurities remain in the bag. It is well  to put a few pebbles in the bag, to keep it from floating. Honey may  be separated from the comb, by placing it in the hot sun, or before  the fire, with two or three colanders or sieves, each finer than the  other, under it.           *       *       *       *       *          SOAP.      In the city, I believe, it is better to exchange ashes and grease for  soap; but in the country, I am certain, it is good economy to make  one's own soap. If you burn wood, you can make your own lye; but the  ashes of coal is not worth much. Bore small holes in the bottom of a  barrel, place four bricks around, and fill the barrel with ashes. Wet  the ashes well, but not enough to drop; let it soak thus three or four  days; then pour a gallon of water in every hour or two, for a day or  more, and let it drop into a pail or tub beneath. Keep it dripping  till the color of the lye shows the strength is exhausted. If your  lye is not strong enough, you must fill your barrel with fresh ashes,  and let the lye run through it. Some people take a barrel without  any bottom, and lay sticks and straw across to prevent the ashes from  falling through. To make a barrel of soap, it will require about five  or six bushels of ashes, with at least four quarts of unslacked stone  lime; if slacked, doable the quantity.    When you have drawn off a part of the lye, put the lime (whether slack  or not) into two or three pails of boiling water, and add it to the  ashes, and let it drain through.    It is the practice of some people, in making soap, to put the lime  near the bottom of the ashes when they first set it tip; but the lime  becomes like mortar, and the lye does not run through, so as to get  the strength of it, which is very important in making soap, as it  contracts the nitrous salts which collect in ashes, and prevents the  soap from _coming_, (as the saying is.) Old ashes are very apt to be  impregnated with it.    Three pounds of grease should be put into a pailful of lye. The great  difficulty in making soap '_come_' originates in want of judgment  about the strength of the lye. One rule may be safely trusted--If your  lye will bear up an egg, or a potato, so that you can see a piece of  the surface as big as ninepence, it is just strong enough. If it sink  below the top of the lye, it is too weak, and will never make soap;  if it is buoyed up half way, the lye is too strong; and that is just  as bad. A bit of quick-lime, thrown in while the lye and grease are  boiling together, is of service. When the soap becomes thick and ropy,  carry it down cellar in pails and empty it into a barrel.    Cold soap is less trouble, because it does not need to boil; the sun  does the work of fire. The lye must be prepared and tried in the usual  way. The grease must be tried out, and strained from the scraps. Two  pounds of grease (instead of three) must be used to a pailful; unless  the weather is very sultry, the lye should be hot when put to the  grease. It should stand in the sun, and be stirred every day. If it  does not begin to look like soap in the course of five or six days,  add a little hot lye to it; if this does not help it, try whether it  be grease that it wants. Perhaps you will think cold soap wasteful,  because the grease must be strained; but if the scraps are boiled  thoroughly in strong lye, the grease will all float upon the surface,  and nothing be lost.           *       *       *       *       *          SIMPLE REMEDIES.      Cotton wool, wet with sweet oil and paregoric, relieves the ear-ache  very soon.    A good quantity of old cheese is the best thing to eat, when  distressed by eating too much fruit, or oppressed with any kind of  food. Physicians have given it in cases of extreme danger.    Honey and milk is very good for worms; so is strong salt water;  likewise powdered sage and molasses taken freely.    For a sudden attack of quincy or croup, bathe the neck with bear's  grease, and pour it down the throat. A linen rag soaked in sweet oil,  butter, or lard, and sprinkled with yellow Scotch snuff, is said to  have performed wonderful cures in cases of croup: it should be placed  where the distress is greatest. Goose-grease, or any kind of oily  grease, is as good as bear's oil.    Equal parts of camphor, spirits of wine, and hartshorn, well mixed,  and rubbed upon the throat, is said to be good for the croup.    Cotton wool and oil are the best things for a burn. A poultice  of wheat bran, or rye bran, and vinegar, very soon takes down the  inflammation occasioned by a sprain. Brown paper, wet, is healing to a  bruise. Dipped in molasses, it is said to take down inflammation.    In case of any scratch, or wound, from which the lockjaw is  apprehended, bathe the injured part freely with lye or pearl-ash and  water.    A rind of pork bound upon a wound occasioned by a needle, pin, or  nail, prevents the lock-jaw. It should be always applied. Spirits of  turpentine is good to prevent the lock-jaw. Strong soft-soap, mixed  with pulverized chalk, about as thick as batter, put, in a thin cloth  or bag, upon the wound, is said to be a preventive to this dangerous  disorder. The chalk should be kept moist, till the wound begins to  discharge itself; when the patient will find relief.    If you happen to cut yourself slightly while cooking, bind on some  fine salt: molasses is likewise good.    Flour boiled thoroughly in milk, so as to make quite a thick porridge,  is good in cases of dysentery. A tablespoonful of W.I. rum, a  table-spoonful of sugar-baker's molasses, and the same quantity of  sweet oil, well simmered together, is likewise good for this disorder;  the oil softens the harshness of the other ingredients.    Black or green tea, steeped in boiling milk, seasoned with nutmeg,  and best of loaf sugar, is excellent for the dysentery. Cork burnt  to charcoal, about as big as a hazel-nut, macerated, and put in a  tea-spoonful of brandy, with a little loaf sugar and nutmeg, is very  efficacious in cases of dysentery and cholera-morbus. If nutmeg  be wanting, peppermint-water may be used. Flannel wet with brandy,  powdered with Cayenne pepper, and laid upon the bowels, affords great  relief in cases of extreme distress.    Dissolve as much table-salt in keen vinegar, as will ferment and work  clear. When the foam is discharged, cork it up in a bottle, and put it  away for use. A large spoonful of this, in a gill of boiling water, is  very efficacious in cases of dysentery and colic.[3]    [Footnote 3: Among the numerous medicines for this disease, perhaps  none, after all, is better, particularly where the bowels are  inflamed, than the old-fashioned one of English-mallows steeped  in milk, and drank freely. Everybody knows, of course, that  English-mallows and marsh-mallows are different herbs.]    Whortleberries, commonly called huckleberries, dried, are a useful  medicine for children. Made into tea, and sweetened with molasses,  they are very beneficial, when the system is in a restricted state,  and the digestive powers out of order.    Blackberries are extremely useful in cases of dysentery. To eat  the berries is very healthy; tea made of the roots and leaves  is beneficial; and a syrup made of the berries is still better.  Blackberries have sometimes effected a cure when physicians despaired.    Loaf sugar and brandy relieves a sore throat; when very bad, it is  good to inhale the steam of scalding hot vinegar through the tube of  a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],[0,"Two Little Savages (#5)"],[1,"first and built it all at once, but that  was not Yan's way; he was too eager to see the walls rise. He had  painfully and slowly gathered logs enough to raise the walls three  rounds, when the question of a door occurred to him. This, of course,  could not be cut through the logs in the ordinary way; that required  the best of tools. So he lifted out all the front logs except the  lowest, replacing them at the ends with stones and blocks to sustain  the sides. This gave him the sudden gain of two logs, and helped the  rest of the walls that much. The shanty was now about three feet high,  and no two logs in it were alike: some were much too long, most were  crooked and some were half rotten, for the simple reason that these  were the only ones he could cut. He had exhausted the logs in the  neighbourhood and was forced to go farther. Now he remembered seeing  one that might do, half a mile away on the home trail (they were  always \"trails\"; he never called them \"roads\" or \"paths\"). He went  after this, and to his great surprise and delight found that it was  one of a dozen old cedar posts that had been cut long before and  thrown aside as culls, or worthless. He could carry only one at a  time, so that to bring each one meant a journey of a mile, and the  post got woefully heavy each time before that mile was over. To  get those twelve logs he had twelve miles to walk. It took several  Saturdays, but he stuck doggedly to it. Twelve good logs completed  his shanty, making it five feet high and leaving three logs over for  rafters. These he laid flat across, dividing the spaces equally. Over  them he laid plenty of small sticks and branches till it was thickly  covered. Then he went down to a rank, grassy meadow and, with his  knife, cut hay for a couple of hours. This was spread thickly on the  roof, to be covered with strips of Elm bark then on top of all he  threw the clay dug from the bank, piling it well back, stamping on it,  and working it down at the edges. Finally, he threw rubbish and leaves  over it, so that it was confused with the general tangle.    Thus the roof was finished, but the whole of the front was open. He  dreaded the search for more logs, so tried a new plan. He found,  first, some sticks about six feet long and two or three inches  through. Not having an axe to sharpen and drive them, he dug pairs of  holes a foot deep, one at each end and another pair near the middle of  the front ground log.    Into each of these he put a pair of upright sticks, leading up to the  eave log, one inside and one outside of it, then packed the earth  around them in the holes. Next, he went to the brook-side and cut a  number of long green willow switches about half an inch thick at the  butt. These switches he twisted around the top of each pair of stakes  in a figure 8, placing them to hold the stake tight against the bottom  and top logs at the front.    Down by the spring he now dug a hole and worked water and clay  together into mortar, then with a trowel cut out of a shingle, and  mortar carried in an old bucket, he built a wall within the stakes,  using sticks laid along the outside and stones set in mud till the  front was closed up, except a small hole for a window and a large hole  for a door.    Now he set about finishing the inside. He gathered moss in the woods  and stuffed all the chinks in the upper parts, and those next the  ground he filled with stones and earth. Thus the shanty was finished;  but it lacked a door.    The opening was four feet high and two feet wide, so in the woodshed  at home he cut three boards, each eight inches wide and four feet  high, but he left at each end of one a long point. Doing this at home  gave him the advantage of a saw. Then with these and two shorter  boards, each two feet long and six inches wide, he sneaked out to  Glenyan, and there, with some nails and a stone for a hammer, he  fastened them together into a door. In the ground log he pecked a hole  big enough to receive one of the points and made a corresponding hole  in the under side of the top log. Then, prying up the eave log, he put  the door in place, let the eave log down again, and the door was hung.  A string to it made an outside fastening when it was twisted around a  projecting snag in the wall, and a peg thrust into a hole within made  an inside fastener. Some logs, with fir boughs and dried grass, formed  a bunk within. This left only the window, and for lack of better cover  he fastened over it a piece of muslin brought from home. But finding  its dull white a jarring note, he gathered a quart of butternuts, and  watching his chance at home, he boiled the cotton in water with the  nuts and so reduced it to a satisfactory yellowish brown.    His final task was to remove all appearance of disturbance and to  fully hide the shanty in brush and trailing vines. Thus, after weeks  of labour, his woodland home was finished. It was only five feet high  inside, six feet long and six feet wide--dirty and uncomfortable--but  what a happiness it was to have it.    Here for the first time in his life he began to realize something  of the pleasure of single-handed achievement in the line of a great  ambition.          VIII    Beginnings of Woodlore      During this time Yan had so concentrated all his powers on the shanty  that he had scarcely noticed the birds and wild things. Such was his  temperament--one idea only, and that with all his strength.    His heart was more and more in his kingdom now he longed to come  and live here. But he only dared to dream that some day he might be  allowed to pass a night in the shanty. This was where he would lead  his ideal life--the life of an Indian with all that is bad and cruel  left out. Here he would show men how to live without cutting down all  the trees, spoiling all the streams, and killing every living thing.  He would learn how to get the fullest pleasure out of the woods  himself and then teach others how to do the same. Though the birds and  Fourfoots fascinated him, he would not have hesitated to shoot one  had he been able, but to see a tree cut down always caused him  great distress. Possibly he realized that the bird might be quickly  replaced, but the tree, never.    To carry out his plan he must work hard at school, for books had  much that he needed. Perhaps some day he might get a chance to see  Audubon's drawings, and so have all his bird worries settled by a  single book.    That summer a new boy at school added to Yan's savage equipment. This  boy was neither good nor bright; he was a dunce, and had been expelled  from a boarding school for misconduct, but he had a number of  schoolboy accomplishments that gave him a tinge of passing glory.  He could tie a lot of curious knots in a string. He could make a  wonderful birdy warble, and he spoke a language that he called Tutnee.  Yan was interested in all, but especially the last. He teased and  bribed till he was admitted to the secret. It consisted in spelling  every word, leaving the five vowels as they are, but doubling each  consonant and putting a \"u\" between. Thus \"b\" became \"bub,\" \"d\" \"dud,\"  \"m\" \"mum,\" and so forth, except that \"c\" was \"suk,\" \"h\" \"hash,\" \"x\"  \"zux,\" and \"w\" \"wak.\"    The sample given by the new boy, \"sus-hash-u-tut u-pup yak-o-u-rur  mum-o-u-tut-hash,\" was said to be a mode of enjoining silence.    This language was \"awful useful,\" the new boy said, to keep the other  fellows from knowing what you were saying, which it certainly did. Yan  practised hard at it and within a few weeks was an adept. He could  handle the uncouth sentences better than his teacher, and he was  singularly successful in throwing in accents and guttural tones that  imparted a delightfully savage flavour, and he rejoiced in jabbering  away to the new boy in the presence of others so that he might bask in  the mystified look on the faces of those who were not skilled in the  tongue of the Tutnees.    He made himself a bow and arrows. They were badly made and he could  hit nothing with them, but he felt so like an Indian when he drew the  arrow to its head, that it was another pleasure.    He made a number of arrows with hoop-iron heads, these he could  file at home in the woodshed. The heads were jagged and barbed and  double-barbed. These arrows were frightful-looking things. They seemed  positively devilish in their ferocity, and were proportionately  gratifying. These he called his \"war arrows,\" and would send one into  a tree and watch it shiver, then grunt \"Ugh, heap good,\" and rejoice  in the squirming of the imaginary foe he had pierced.    He found a piece of sheepskin and made of it a pair of very poor  moccasins. He ground an old castaway putty knife into a scalping  knife; the notch in it for breaking glass was an annoying defect until  he remembered that some Indians decorate their weapons with a notch  for each enemy it has killed, and this, therefore, might do duty as a  kill-tally. He made a sheath for the knife out of scraps of leather  left off the moccasins. Some water-colours, acquired by a school swap,  and a bit of broken mirror held in a split stick, were necessary parts  of his Indian toilet. His face during the process of make-up was  always a battle-ground between the horriblest Indian scowl  and a grin of delight at his success in diabolizing his visage with  the paints. Then with painted face and a feather in his hair he would  proudly range the woods in his little kingdom and store up every scrap  of woodlore he could find, invent or learn from his schoolmates.    [Illustration: Yan's toilet]    Odd things that he found in the woods he would bring to his shanty:  curled sticks, feathers, bones, skulls, fungus, shells, an old  cowhorn--things that interested him, he did not know why. He made  Indian necklaces of the shells, strung together alternately with  the backbone of a fish. He let his hair grow as long as possible,  employing various stratagems, even"]]]
