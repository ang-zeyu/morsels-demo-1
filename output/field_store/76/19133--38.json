A  responsiveness that in maturity made them favorites with every one who  knew them, and prompted the tactful ways that convinced each admirer  that his approval was the last seal to their satisfaction in the fame  they had won. When Tom leaned against people confidingly, and put up his  paw in cordial greeting; and Dick and Harry, so much alike that it was  nearly impossible to tell them apart, stood waiting eagerly for the  inevitable words of praise, it was hard indeed to realize that their  perfect manners were a cloak for morals that rough, uncultured Baldy  would condemn utterly.    With the departure of the last boats of the summer there is no  connecting link with the great, unfrozen outside, except the wireless  telegraph and the United States Government Dog Team Mail that is brought  fifteen hundred miles, in relays, over the long white trail from Valdez.  Then, with the early twilight of the long Arctic winter, which lasts  until the dawn of the brilliant sunshine and pleasant warmth of May,  there come the Dog Days of Nome. Days that are heralded by an increased  activity in dog circles, a mysterious fascination that weaves itself  about all prospective entries to the races, and the introduction of a  strange dialect called \"Deep Dog Dope,\" which is the popular means of  communication between all people regardless of age, sex or  nationality--from the Federal Judge on the Bench to the tiniest tots in  Kindergarten.    The town gives itself up completely to the gripping intensities and  ardors of this period when all dog men assemble in appropriate places to  talk over the prospects of the coming Racing Season. Accordingly George  and Danny were in the habit of meeting in the Kennel, each afternoon, to  consider the burning questions of the hour, with all of the certain  knowledge and wide experience that belonged to their mature years--for  George and Danny were seven and eight respectively.    Often Ben, whose mother had obtained work in town so that he might go to  school regularly, joined in these important discussions; and while  somewhat older than his companions, he greatly enjoyed being with them,  for they were manly little fellows and had picked up much valuable dog  lore from \"Scotty\" and Matt.    The Woman, too, for no apparent reason, was frequently at these serious  conclaves, and was apt to voice rather trifling views on the weighty  matters in debate. George felt that she was entitled only to the  courteous toleration one accords the weaker sex in matters too deep for  their inconsequent minds to grasp fully; for even if she was his  father's racing partner, she had openly acknowledged that she considered  dogs a pastime, and not a life study, which naturally proved her mental  limitations.    [Illustration: The Woman]    One of the events already assured was a race for boys under nine years  of age. \"It's too bad you're too old for it, Ben,\" George had exclaimed  sympathetically. \"Father's told Danny and me we can use some of his  dogs; and he'd 'a' been glad t' do the same for you. When I want t'  drive fast dogs, and go t' the Moving Pictures at night, and drink  coffee, I wish I was old too; but now I can see that gettin' old's  pretty tough on a feller sometimes.\"    \"Mebbe there'll be a race fer the older boys later,\" replied Ben  hopefully. \"I dunno as I could do much myself, but I sure would like t'  try Baldy out. He minds so quick I think he'd be a fine leader; an' it  looks like he'd be fast from the way he chases rabbits and squirrels  out on the tundra.\"    \"You can't allers tell about that,\" observed Dan pessimistically. \"I got  a dog that's a corker when he's just chasin' things; but when I put a  harness on him he ain't fit for a High School Girl's Racin' Team, an'  you know what girls is for gettin' speed out of a dog. 'You poor tired  little doggie, you can stop right here an' rest if you want to; I don't  care if they do get ahead of us,'\" and Danny finished his remarks in the  high falsetto and mincing inflection he attributed to the youthful  members of a sex that in his opinion, as well as in George's, has no  right to engage in the masculine occupation of Dog Mushing.    \"Of course,\" said George, looking thoughtfully at Baldy, who was lying  contentedly at Ben's feet, and giving voice to the wisdom of \"Scotty\" or  Matt in such discussions, \"of course, in a dog that's goin' in for the  Big Race, you got t' have more'n speed. You can't depend on just that  for four hundred and eight miles. There's got t' be lots of endurance  an' the dogs had ought t' really enjoy racin' t' do their best. But for  this race we're goin' in, Danny, I guess speed's the whole thing.  Speed, an' the dog's mindin' you.\" George glanced involuntarily toward  Jack McMillan, who sat with his head resting against the Woman's knee.  \"You can't do anythin' at all, no matter how fast dogs is, if they don't  mind.\"    \"I'm afraid, Mr. McMillan,\" commented the Woman seriously, \"that these  personalities are meant for you. Just because your first owner spoiled  you, and the second paid the highest price ever given for a dog in the  North, all accuse you of thinking yourself far too important to be  classed with the common herd whose chief virtue is obedience. They say  you lost a great race by being ungovernable. Guilty, or not guilty?\" The  brown eyes that had been wont to blaze so fiercely now looked pleadingly  into the Woman's face, and the sable muzzle was pressed more closely  against her. \"They started you off all wrong, Jack. They let you become  headstrong, and then tried to force you arbitrarily into their ways,  instead of persuading you. If you had been a human being, all this would  have been considered Temperament, but being only a dog it was Temper,  and was dealt with as such.\" McMillan gravely extended his paw in  appreciation of her championship.    \"Oh, I didn't only just mean Jack when I was talkin' about dogs not  mindin',\" explained George with embarrassed haste; for he knew of the  Woman's fondness for the dog and did not wish to hurt her feelings, much  as he condemned her judgment in selecting such a favorite.    Her preference had dated from the night when she had entered the Kennel  after a long absence, and had seen the stranger in the half light of the  June midnight. He had changed somewhat since the imperious days when he  had threatened the life of his trainer, and she had not recognized the  Incorrigible in the handsome dog who had greeted her with such  flattering cordiality.    He soon manifested an abject devotion to her, and would barely listen  even to \"Scotty\" when she was near--the moment he heard her footsteps  howling insistently till she ignored all of the others and came directly  to him. It became a matter of pride with her to take him into the  streets where people would still look askance at the erstwhile  \"man-eater,\" and comment on her courage in handling the \"brute.\" While  she and the \"brute\" had the little joke between them, which she later  confided to Ben, that Jack McMillan's misdemeanors were merely the  result of an undisciplined nature handled unsympathetically, and that at  heart he was the gentlest dog in Nome.    \"Jack minds all right now,\" ventured Ben. \"I seen him the other day with  Mr. Allan, an' he minded as good as any of 'em--even Kid.\"    \"Well, none of them could do better than that. 'Scotty' says that Kid  has every admirable quality that a dog could possibly possess, and that  without a doubt he is the most promising racing leader in Alaska. But of  course Jack would have to mind or he would not be here. The first thing  a new dog must realize is that 'Scotty' is the sole authority, and that  obedience is the first law of the Kennel. Even with his first racing  driver I believe it was more a case of misunderstanding on both sides  than wilful disobedience. But it grew to a point where it became almost  a matter of life or death for one or the other.\"    \"Moose Jones said they had t' break his tusks t' use him at all, an'  that it took three men t' hold him away from his driver sometimes; an'  that 'Scotty' was the only man in the whole North that could git the  best of him without breakin' his spirit. An' he seems terrible fond o'  'Scotty'--I mean Mr. Allan--now.\"    \"You may call him 'Scotty,' Ben; he doesn't mind in the least. He's  'Scotty' to every Alaskan from Juneau to Barrow, Eskimos included--age  no restraint. Yes, Jack is fond of 'Scotty,' but it took a battle royal  to bring about this permanent peace.\"    \"It's a wonder he wasn't killed before you an' 'Scotty' got him, if they  was all so scared t' handle him.\"    \"He would have been killed except that his enormous strength and unusual  alertness made him too valuable. So in spite of their fears they kept  him, but he was watched incessantly; and after his tusks were broken he  became even more rebellious, and grew to distrust every one about him.  Poor old fellow.\" She turned the handsome head toward the boy. \"Look at  him, Ben. Would you believe that they used to frighten naughty children  by telling them that Jack was out looking for them?\"    It was a fact that his name had once carried a suggestion of grim terror  and impending disaster in Nome. And the dark hint that McMillan of the  Broken Tusks was in the neighborhood struck consternation to the hearts  of infant malefactors, and had been the source of much unwilling virtue,  and many a politic repentance on the part of those offenders hitherto  only impressed by the threatened arrival of the Policeman.    Ben regarded Jack with admiration and pity. He was sorry for even a dog  that has been misunderstood.    \"No, ma'am, he don't look vicious, but he sure does look powerful.

Or,      reading {otan paradexetai ton ippea (sc. o. ippos) ws      anabesomenon}, transl. \"the horse has been brought round ready for      mounting.\"     (2) So Courier, \"la muserolle.\" It might be merely a stitched leather      strap or made of a chain in part, which rattled; as      {khrusokhalinon patagon psalion} (Aristoph. \"Peace,\" 155) implies.      \"Curb\" would be misleading.

In fact, he has nothing else to learn except  to do with his right limbs what he has previously done with the left,  and vice versa. And the reason we approve of this method of mounting  is (8) that it enables the soldier at one and the same instant to  get astride of his horse and to find himself prepared at all points,  supposing he should have to enter the lists of battle on a sudden.     (8) Lit. \"One reason for the praise which we bestow on this method of      mounting is that at the very instant of gaining his seat the      soldier finds himself fully prepared to engage the enemy on a      sudden, if occasion need.\"    But now, supposing the rider fairly seated, whether bareback or on a  saddle-cloth, a good seat is not that of a man seated on a chair, but  rather the pose of a man standing upright with his legs apart. In this  way he will be able to hold on to the horse more firmly by his thighs;  and this erect attitude will enable him to hurl a javelin or to strike  a blow from horseback, if occasion calls, with more vigorous effect.  The leg and foot should hang loosely from the knee; by keeping the  leg stiff, the rider is apt to have it broken in collision with some  obstacle; whereas a flexible leg (9) will yield to the impact, and at  the same time not shift the thigh from its position. The rider should  also accustom the whole of his body above the hips to be as supple as  possible; for thus he will enlarge his scope of action, and in case of  a tug or shove be less liable to be unseated. Next, when the rider is  seated, he must, in the first place, teach his horse to stand quiet,  until he has drawn his skirts from under him, if need be, (10) and got  the reins an equal length and grasped his spear in the handiest fashion;  and, in the next place, he should keep his left arm close to his side.  This position will give the rider absolute ease and freedom, (11) and  his hand the firmest hold.     (9) i.e. \"below the knee\"; \"shin and calf.\"     (10) Lit. \"pulled up\" (and arranged the folds of his mantle).     (11) {eustalestatos}, \"the most business-like deportment.\"    As to reins, we recommend those which are well balanced, without being  weak or slippery or thick, so that when necessary, the hand which holds  them can also grasp a spear.    As soon as the rider gives the signal to the horse to start, (12) he  should begin at a walking pace, which will tend to allay his excitement.  If the horse is inclined to droop his head, the reins should be held  pretty high; or somewhat low, if he is disposed to carry his head high.  This will set off the horse's bearing to the best advantage. Presently,  as he falls into a natural trot, (13) he will gradually relax his limbs  without the slightest suffering, and so come more agreeably to the  gallop. (14) Since, too, the preference is given to starting on the left  foot, it will best conduce to that lead if, while the horse is still  trotting, the signal to gallop should be given at the instant of making  a step with his right foot. (15) As he is on the point of lifting  his left foot he will start upon it, and while turning left will  simultaneously make the first bound of the gallop; (16) since, as a  matter of instinct, a horse, on being turned to the right, leads off  with his right limbs, and to the left with his left.     (12) \"Forwards!\"     (13) Or, \"the true trot.\"     (14) {epirrabdophorein}, \"a fast pace in response to a wave of the      whip.\"     (15) See Berenger, i. p. 249; also the \"Cavalry Drill Book,\" Part I.      Equitation, S. 22, \"The Canter.\"     (16) {tes episkeliseos}, \"he will make the forward stride of the      gallop in the act of turning to the left.\" See Morgan ad loc.    As an exercise, we recommend what is called the volte, (17) since it  habituates the animal to turn to either hand; while a variation in the  order of the turn is good as involving an equalisation of both sides of  the mouth, in first one, and then the other half of the exercise. (18)  But of the two we commend the oval form of the volte rather than the  circular; for the horse, being already sated with the straight course,  will be all the more ready to turn, and will be practised at once in  the straight course and in wheeling. At the curve, he should be held  up, (19) because it is neither easy nor indeed safe when the horse is  at full speed to turn sharp, especially if the ground is broken (20) or  slippery.     (17) {pede}, figure of eight.     (18) Or, \"on first one and then the other half of the manege.\"     (19) {upolambanein}. See \"Hipparch,\" iii. 14; \"Hunting,\" iii. 10; vi.      22, of a dog.     (20) {apokroton}, al. {epikroton}, \"beaten, hard-trodden ground.\"    But in collecting him, the rider should as little as possible sway the  horse obliquely with the bit, and as little as possible incline his own  body; or, he may rest assured, a trifle will suffice to stretch him and  his horse full length upon the ground. The moment the horse has his eyes  fixed on the straight course after making a turn, is the time to urge  him to full speed. In battle, obviously, these turns and wheelings  are with a view to charging or retiring; consequently, to practise  quickening the pace after wheeling is desirable. When the horse seems  to have had enough of the manege, it would be good to give him a slight  pause, and then suddenly to put him to his quickest, away from his  fellows first, (21) and now towards them; and then again to quiet him  down in mid-career as short as possible; (22) and from halt once more  to turn him right-about and off again full charge. It is easy to  predict that the day will come when there will be need of each of these  manoeuvres.     (21) {mentoi}, \"of course.\"     (22) Or, \"within the narrowest compass\"; \"as finely as possible.\"    When the moment to dismount has come, you should never do so among  other horses, nor near a group of people, (23) nor outside the  exercising-ground; but on the precise spot which is the scene of his  compulsory exertion there let the horse find also relaxation. (24)     (23) Or, \"a knot of bystanders\"; cf. Thuc. ii. 21.     (24) Or, as we say, \"be caressed, and dismissed.\"        VIII    As there will, doubtless, be times when the horse will need to race  downhill and uphill and on sloping ground; times, also, when he will  need to leap across an obstacle; or, take a flying leap from off a bank;  (1) or, jump down from a height, the rider must teach and train himself  and his horse to meet all emergencies. In this way the two will have a  chance of saving each the other, and may be expected to increase their  usefulness.     (1) {ekpedan} = exsilire in altum (Sturz, and so Berenger); \"to leap      over ditches, and upon high places and down from them.\"    And here, if any reader should accuse us of repeating ourselves, on  the ground that we are only stating now what we said before on the same  topics, (2) we say that this is not mere repetition. In the former case,  we confined ourselves to advising the purchaser before he concluded his  bargain to test whether the horse could do those particular things; (3)  what we are now maintaining is that the owner ought to teach his own  horse, and we will explain how this teaching is to be done.     (2) Or, \"treating of a topic already handled.\"     (3) i.e. possessed a certain ability at the date of purchase.    With a horse entirely ignorant of leaping, the best way is to take him  by the leading rein, which hangs loose, and to get across the trench  yourself first, and then to pull tight on the leading-rein, to induce  him to leap across. If he refuses, some one with a whip or switch should  apply it smartly. The result will be that the horse will clear at a  bound, not the distance merely, but a far larger space than requisite;  and for the future there will be no need for an actual blow, the mere  sight of some one coming up behind will suffice to make him leap. As  soon as he is accustomed to leap in this way you may mount him and put  him first at smaller and then at larger trenches. At the moment of the  spring be ready to apply the spur; and so too, when training him to leap  up and leap down, you should touch him with the spur at the critical  instant. In the effort to perform any of these actions with the whole  body, the horse will certainly perform them with more safety to himself  and to his rider than he will, if his hind-quarters lag, in taking a  ditch or fence, or in making an upward spring or downward jump. (4)     (4) Lit. \"in making these jumps, springs, and leaps across or up or      down.\"    To face a steep incline, you must first teach him on soft ground, and  finally, when he is accustomed to that, he will much prefer the downward  to the upward slope for a fast pace. And as to the apprehension, which  some "]]]
