The  puffs of smoke, the orange glare, the round eye of light in front of it,  the melodious rattle. Fine effects! But these furnaces of mine used to be  finer, before we shoved cones in their throats, and saved the gas.\"    \"How?\" said Raut. \"Cones?\"    \"Cones, my man, cones. I'll show you one nearer. The flames used to flare  out of the open throats, great--what is it?--pillars of cloud by day, red  and black smoke, and pillars of fire by night. Now we run it off--in  pipes, and burn it to heat the blast, and the top is shut by a cone.  You'll be interested in that cone.\"    \"But every now and then,\" said Raut, \"you get a burst of fire and smoke up  there.\"    \"The cone's not fixed, it's hung by a chain from a lever, and balanced by  an equipoise. You shall see it nearer. Else, of course, there'd be no way  of getting fuel into the thing. Every now and then the cone dips, and out  comes the flare.\"    \"I see,\" said Raut. He looked over his shoulder. \"The moon gets brighter,\"  he said.    \"Come along,\" said Horrocks abruptly, gripping his shoulder again, and  moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing. And then came one of  those swift incidents, vivid, but so rapid that they leave one doubtful  and reeling. Half-way across, Horrocks's hand suddenly clenched upon him  like a vice, and swung him backward and through a half-turn, so that he  looked up the line. And there a chain of lamp-lit carriage windows  telescoped swiftly as it came towards them, and the red and yellow lights  of an engine grew larger and larger, rushing down upon them. As he grasped  what this meant, he turned his face to Horrocks, and pushed with all his  strength against the arm that held him back between the rails. The  struggle did not last a moment. Just as certain as it was that Horrocks  held him there, so certain was it that he had been violently lugged out of  danger.    \"Out of the way,\" said Horrocks with a gasp, as the train came rattling  by, and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks.    \"I did not see it coming,\" said Raut, still, even in spite of his own  apprehensions, trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse.    Horrocks answered with a grunt. \"The cone,\" he said, and then, as one who  recovers himself, \"I thought you did not hear.\"    \"I didn't,\" said Raut.    \"I wouldn't have had you run over then for the world,\" said Horrocks.    \"For a moment I lost my nerve,\" said Raut.    Horrocks stood for half a minute, then turned abruptly towards the  ironworks again. \"See how fine these great mounds of mine, these  clinker-heaps, look in the night! That truck yonder, up above there! Up  it goes, and out-tilts the slag. See the palpitating red stuff go sliding  down the slope. As we get nearer, the heap rises up and cuts the blast  furnaces. See the quiver up above the big one. Not that way! This way,  between the heaps. That goes to the puddling furnaces, but I want to show  you the canal first.\" He came and took Raut by the elbow, and so they went  along side by side. Raut answered Horrocks vaguely. What, he asked  himself, had really happened on the line? Was he deluding himself with his  own fancies, or had Horrocks actually held him back in the way of the  train? Had he just been within an ace of being murdered?    Suppose this slouching, scowling monster _did_ know anything? For a  minute or two then Raut was really afraid for his life, but the mood  passed as he reasoned with himself. After all, Horrocks might have heard  nothing. At any rate, he had pulled him out of the way in time. His odd  manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown once before.  He was talking now of the ash-heaps and the canal. \"Eigh?\" said Horrocks.    \"What?\" said Raut. \"Rather! The haze in the moonlight. Fine!\"    \"Our canal,\" said Horrocks, stopping suddenly. \"Our canal by moonlight and  firelight is immense. You've never seen it? Fancy that! You've spent too  many of your evenings philandering up in Newcastle there. I tell you, for  real florid quality----But you shall see. Boiling water ...\"    As they came out of the labyrinth of clinker-heaps and mounds of coal and  ore, the noises of the rolling-mill sprang upon them suddenly, loud, near,  and distinct. Three shadowy workmen went by and touched their caps to  Horrocks. Their faces were vague in the darkness. Raut felt a futile  impulse to address them, and before he could frame his words they passed  into the shadows. Horrocks pointed to the canal close before them now: a  weird-looking place it seemed, in the blood-red reflections of the  furnaces. The hot water that cooled the tuyeres came into it, some fifty  yards up--a tumultuous, almost boiling affluent, and the steam rose up  from the water in silent white wisps and streaks, wrapping damply about  them, an incessant succession of ghosts coming up from the black and red  eddies, a white uprising that made the head swim. The shining black tower  of the larger blast-furnace rose overhead out of the mist, and its  tumultuous riot filled their ears. Raut kept away from the edge of the  water, and watched Horrocks.    \"Here it is red,\" said Horrocks, \"blood-red vapour as red and hot as sin;  but yonder there, where the moonlight falls on it, and it drives across  the clinker-heaps, it is as white as death.\"    Raut turned his head for a moment, and then came back hastily to his watch  on Horrocks. \"Come along to the rolling-mills,\" said Horrocks. The  threatening hold was not so evident that time, and Raut felt a little  reassured. But all the same, what on earth did Horrocks mean about \"white  as death\" and \"red as sin\"? Coincidence, perhaps?    They went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while, and then  through the rolling-mills, where amidst an incessant din the deliberate  steam-hammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron, and black,  half-naked Titans rushed the plastic bars, like hot sealing-wax, between  the wheels, \"Come on,\" said Horrocks in Raut's ear; and they went and  peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyeres, and saw the  tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blast-furnace. It left one eye  blinded for a while. Then, with green and blue patches dancing across the  dark, they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime  were raised to the top of the big cylinder.    And out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace Raut's doubts came  upon him again. Was it wise to be here? If Horrocks did know--everything!  Do what he would, he could not resist a violent trembling. Right under  foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet. It was a dangerous place. They  pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing that crowned the thing.  The reek of the furnace, a sulphurous vapour streaked with pungent  bitterness, seemed to make the distant hillside of Hanley quiver. The moon  was riding out now from among a drift of clouds, half-way up the sky above  the undulating wooded outlines of Newcastle. The steaming canal ran away  from below them under an indistinct bridge, and vanished into the dim haze  of the flat fields towards Burslem.    \"That's the cone I've been telling you of,\" shouted Horrocks; \"and, below  that, sixty feet of fire and molten metal, with the air of the blast  frothing through it like gas in soda-water.\"    Raut gripped the hand-rail tightly, and stared down at the cone. The heat  was intense. The boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made a  thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks's voice. But the thing had to be gone  through now. Perhaps, after all...    \"In the middle,\" bawled Horrocks, \"temperature near a thousand degrees. If  _you_ were dropped into it ... flash into flame like a pinch of  gunpowder in a candle. Put your hand out and feel the heat of his breath.  Why, even up here I've seen the rain-water boiling off the trucks. And  that cone there. It's a damned sight too hot for roasting cakes. The top  side of it's three hundred degrees.\"    \"Three hundred degrees!\" said Raut.    \"Three hundred centigrade, mind!\" said Horrocks. \"It will boil the blood  out of you in no time.\"    \"Eigh?\" said Raut, and turned.    \"Boil the blood out of you in ... No, you don't!\"    \"Let me go!\" screamed Raut. \"Let go my arm!\"    With one hand he clutched at the hand-rail, then with both. For a moment  the two men stood swaying. Then suddenly, with a violent jerk, Horrocks  had twisted him from his hold. He clutched at Horrocks and missed, his  foot went back into empty air; in mid-air he twisted himself, and then  cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone together.    He clutched the chain by which the cone hung, and the thing sank an  infinitesimal amount as he struck it. A circle of glowing red appeared  about him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos within,  flickered up towards him. An intense pain assailed him at the knees, and  he could smell the singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his feet,  and tried to climb up the chain, and then something struck his head. Black  and shining with the moonlight, the throat of the furnace rose about  him.    Horrocks, he saw, stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the  rail. The gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight, and  shouting, \"Fizzle, you fool! Fizzle, you hunter of women! You hot-blooded  hound! Boil! boil! boil!\"    Suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck, and flung it  deliberately, lump after lump, at Raut.    \"Horrocks!\" cried Raut. \"Horrocks!\"    He clung, crying, to the chain, pulling himself up from the burning of the  cone. Each missile Horrocks flung hit him. His clothes charred and glowed,  and as he struggled the cone dropped, and a rush of hot, suffocating gas  whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame.    His human likeness departed from him. When the momentary red had passed,  Horrocks saw a charred, blackened figure,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1188"],[0,"The Lair of the White Worm (#5)"],[1,"avenport, who was standing by, having arrived  with the bailiff of Lesser Hill, who had followed Mr. Salton in a pony  trap.  As he spoke, he pointed to an attentive ship's steward, and  presently the two men were conversing.    \"I think we ought to be moving,\" Mr. Salton said to Adam.  \"I have some  things to do in Liverpool, and I am sure that both Mr. Caswall and Lady  Arabella would like to get under weigh for Castra Regis.\"    \"I too, sir, would like to do something,\" replied Adam.  \"I want to find  out where Ross, the animal merchant, lives--I want to take a small animal  home with me, if you don't mind.  He is only a little thing, and will be  no trouble.\"    \"Of course not, my boy.  What kind of animal is it that you want?\"    \"A mongoose.\"    \"A mongoose!  What on earth do you want it for?\"    \"To kill snakes.\"    \"Good!\"  The old man remembered the mound of stones.  No explanation was  needed.    When Ross heard what was wanted, he asked:    \"Do you want something special, or will an ordinary mongoose do?\"    \"Well, of course I want a good one.  But I see no need for anything  special.  It is for ordinary use.\"    \"I can let you have a choice of ordinary ones.  I only asked, because I  have in stock a very special one which I got lately from Nepaul.  He has  a record of his own.  He killed a king cobra that had been seen in the  Rajah's garden.  But I don't suppose we have any snakes of the kind in  this cold climate--I daresay an ordinary one will do.\"    When Adam got back to the carriage, carefully carrying the box with the  mongoose, Sir Nathaniel said: \"Hullo! what have you got there?\"    \"A mongoose.\"    \"What for?\"    \"To kill snakes!\"    Sir Nathaniel laughed.    \"I heard Lady Arabella's invitation to you to come to Diana's Grove.\"    \"Well, what on earth has that got to do with it?\"    \"Nothing directly that I know of.  But we shall see.\"  Adam waited, and  the old man went on: \"Have you by any chance heard the other name which  was given long ago to that place.\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"It was called--Look here, this subject wants a lot of talking over.  Suppose we wait till we are alone and have lots of time before us.\"    \"All right, sir.\"  Adam was filled with curiosity, but he thought it  better not to hurry matters.  All would come in good time.  Then the  three men returned home, leaving Mr. Caswall to spend the night in  Liverpool.    The following day the Lesser Hill party set out for Castra Regis, and for  the time Adam thought no more of Diana's Grove or of what mysteries it  had contained--or might still contain.    The guests were crowding in, and special places were marked for important  people.  Adam, seeing so many persons of varied degree, looked round for  Lady Arabella, but could not locate her.  It was only when he saw the old-  fashioned travelling carriage approach and heard the sound of cheering  which went with it, that he realised that Edgar Caswall had arrived.  Then, on looking more closely, he saw that Lady Arabella, dressed as he  had seen her last, was seated beside him.  When the carriage drew up at  the great flight of steps, the host jumped down and gave her his hand.    It was evident to all that she was the chief guest at the festivities.  It  was not long before the seats on the dais were filled, while the tenants  and guests of lesser importance had occupied all the coigns of vantage  not reserved.  The order of the day had been carefully arranged by a  committee.  There were some speeches, happily neither many nor long; and  then festivities were suspended till the time for feasting arrived.  In  the interval Caswall walked among his guests, speaking to all in a  friendly manner and expressing a general welcome.  The other guests came  down from the dais and followed his example, so there was unceremonious  meeting and greeting between gentle and simple.    Adam Salton naturally followed with his eyes all that went on within  their scope, taking note of all who seemed to afford any interest.  He  was young and a man and a stranger from a far distance; so on all these  accounts he naturally took stock rather of the women than of the men, and  of these, those who were young and attractive.  There were lots of pretty  girls among the crowd, and Adam, who was a handsome young man and well  set up, got his full share of admiring glances.  These did not concern  him much, and he remained unmoved until there came along a group of  three, by their dress and bearing, of the farmer class.  One was a sturdy  old man; the other two were good-looking girls, one of a little over  twenty, the other not quite so old.  So soon as Adam's eyes met those of  the younger girl, who stood nearest to him, some sort of electricity  flashed--that divine spark which begins by recognition, and ends in  obedience.  Men call it \"Love.\"    Both his companions noticed how much Adam was taken by the pretty girl,  and spoke of her to him in a way which made his heart warm to them.    \"Did you notice that party that passed?  The old man is Michael Watford,  one of the tenants of Mr. Caswall.  He occupies Mercy Farm, which Sir  Nathaniel pointed out to you to-day.  The girls are his grand-daughters,  the elder, Lilla, being the only child of his elder son, who died when  she was less than a year old.  His wife died on the same day.  She is a  good girl--as good as she is pretty.  The other is her first cousin, the  daughter of Watford's second son.  He went for a soldier when he was just  over twenty, and was drafted abroad.  He was not a good correspondent,  though he was a good enough son.  A few letters came, and then his father  heard from the colonel of his regiment that he had been killed by dacoits  in Burmah.  He heard from the same source that his boy had been married  to a Burmese, and that there was a daughter only a year old.  Watford had  the child brought home, and she grew up beside Lilla.  The only thing  that they heard of her birth was that her name was Mimi.  The two  children adored each other, and do to this day.  Strange how different  they are!  Lilla all fair, like the old Saxon stock from which she is  sprung; Mimi showing a trace of her mother's race.  Lilla is as gentle as  a dove, but Mimi's black eyes can glow whenever she is upset.  The only  thing that upsets her is when anything happens to injure or threaten or  annoy Lilla.  Then her eyes glow as do the eyes of a bird when her young  are menaced.\"          CHAPTER V--THE WHITE WORM      Mr. Salton introduced Adam to Mr. Watford and his grand-daughters, and  they all moved on together.  Of course neighbours in the position of the  Watfords knew all about Adam Salton, his relationship, circumstances, and  prospects.  So it would have been strange indeed if both girls did not  dream of possibilities of the future.  In agricultural England, eligible  men of any class are rare.  This particular man was specially eligible,  for he did not belong to a class in which barriers of caste were strong.  So when it began to be noticed that he walked beside Mimi Watford and  seemed to desire her society, all their friends endeavoured to give the  promising affair a helping hand.  When the gongs sounded for the banquet,  he went with her into the tent where her grandfather had seats.  Mr.  Salton and Sir Nathaniel noticed that the young man did not come to claim  his appointed place at the dais table; but they understood and made no  remark, or indeed did not seem to notice his absence.    Lady Arabella sat as before at Edgar Caswall's right hand.  She was  certainly a striking and unusual woman, and to all it seemed fitting from  her rank and personal qualities that she should be the chosen partner of  the heir on his first appearance.  Of course nothing was said openly by  those of her own class who were present; but words were not necessary  when so much could be expressed by nods and smiles.  It seemed to be an  accepted thing that at last there was to be a mistress of Castra Regis,  and that she was present amongst them.  There were not lacking some who,  whilst admitting all her charm and beauty, placed her in the second rank,  Lilla Watford being marked as first.  There was sufficient divergence of  type, as well as of individual beauty, to allow of fair comment; Lady  Arabella represented the aristocratic type, and Lilla that of the  commonalty.    When the dusk began to thicken, Mr. Salton and Sir Nathaniel walked  home--the trap had been sent away early in the day--leaving Adam to  follow in his own time.  He came in earlier than was expected, and seemed  upset about something.  Neither of the elders made any comment.  They all  lit cigarettes, and, as dinner-time was close at hand, went to their  rooms to get ready.    Adam had evidently been thinking in the interval.  He joined the others  in the drawing-room, looking ruffled and impatient--a condition of things  seen for the first time.  The others, with the patience--or the  experience--of age, trusted to time to unfold and explain things.  They  had not long to wait.  After sitting down and standing up several times,  Adam suddenly burst out.    \"That fellow seems to think he owns the earth.  Can't he let people  alone!  He seems to think that he has only to throw his handkerchief to  any woman, and be her master.\"    This outburst was in itself enlightening.  Only thwarted affection in  some guise could produce this feeling in an amiable young man.  Sir  Nathaniel, as an old diplomatist, had a way of understanding, as if by  foreknowledge, the true inwardness of things, and asked suddenly, but in  a matter-of-fact, indifferent voice:    \"Was he after Lilla?\"    \"Yes, and the fellow didn't lose any time either.  Almost as soon as they  met, he began to butter her up, and tell her how beautiful she was.  Why,  before he left her side, he had asked himself to tea to-morrow at Mercy  Farm.  Stupid ass!  He might see that the girl isn't his sort!  I never  saw"]]]
