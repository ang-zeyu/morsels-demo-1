The wheat being ready to cut down, and amounting  from ten to twenty acres; notice is given in the neighbourhood that a  reaping is to be performed on a particular day, when, as the farmer may  be more or less liked in the village, on the morning of the day  appointed a gang, consisting of an indefinite number of men and women  assemble at the field, and the reaping commences after breakfast, which  is seldom over till between eight and nine o'clock. This company is open  for additional hands to drop in at any time before the twelfth hour to  partake of the frolic of the day. By eleven or twelve o'clock the ale or  cider has so much warmed and elevated their spirits that their noisy  jokes and ribaldry are heard to a considerable distance, and often serve  to draw auxiliary force within the accustomed time. The dinner,  consisting of the best meat and vegetables, is carried into the field  between twelve and one o'clock; this is distributed with copious  draughts of ale and cider, and by two o'clock the pastime of cutting and  binding the wheat is resumed, and continued, without other interruption  than the squabbles of the party, until about five o'clock; when what is  called the drinkings are taken into the field, and under the shade of a  hedge-row, or large tree, the panniers are examined, and buns, cakes,  and all such articles are found as the confectionary skill of the  farmer's wife could produce for gratifying the appetites of her  customary guests at this season. After the drinkings are over, which  generally consume from half to three quarters of an hour, and even  longer, if such can be spared from the completion of the field, the  amusement of the wheat harvest is continued, with such exertions as draw  the reaping and binding of the field together with the close of the  evening. This done, a small sheaf is bound up, and set upon the top of  one of the ridges, when the reapers retiring to a certain distance,  each throws his reap-hook at the sheaf, until one more fortunate, or  less inebriated, than the rest strikes it down; this achievement is  accompanied with the utmost stretch and power of the voices of the  company, uttering words very indistinctly, but somewhat to this  purpose--_we ha in! we ha in! we ha in!_--which noise and tumult  continue about half an hour, when the company retire to the farmhouse  to sup; which being over, large portions of ale and cider enable them  to carouse and vociferate until one or two o'clock in the morning.    At the same house, or that of a neighbouring farmer, a similar scene  is renewed, beginning between eight and nine o'clock in the morning  following, and so continued through the precious season of the wheat  harvest in this county. It must be observed that the labourers thus  employed in reaping receive no wages; but in lieu thereof they have an  invitation to the farmer's house to partake of a harvest frolic, and at  Christmas, during the whole of which time, and which seldom continues  less than three or four days, the house is kept open night and day to  the guests, whose behaviour during the time may be assimilated to the  frolics of a bear-garden.           *       *       *       *       *          SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.           *       *       *       *       *      THE BULL-FIGHTS OF SPAIN AND PORTUGAL.    The following particulars were communicated to the _Gentleman's  Magazine_ of this month by a witness to a recent bull-fight in the  city of Lisbon. Speaking without reference to its humane character or  moral tendency, the writer remarks that no spectacle in the world can be  compared, for interest and effect, to a Spanish bull-fight, every part  of which is distinguished for striking parade or alarming danger.    The grand sweep of the amphitheatre in Cadiz, Seville, or Madrid,  crowded with a gay and variegated mass of eager and shouting spectators,  and garnished at distances with boxes for the judges, the court, or the  music--the immense area in which the combats take place, occupied with  the _picadors_ in silk jackets, on horses richly caparisoned, and  with the light skipping and elastic _bandarilleros_, carrying their  gaudy silk flags to provoke the rage and to elude the attack of the  bull, form of themselves a fine sight before the combat begins. When the  door of the den which encloses the bull is opened, and the noble animal  bursts in wildly upon this, to him, novel scene--his eyes glaring with  fury--when he makes a trot or a gallop round the ring, receiving from  each horseman as he passes a prick from a lance, which enrages him still  more--when, meditating vengeance, he rushes on his adversaries, and  scatters both horsemen and bandarilleros, by his onset, ripping up and  casting the horses on the ground, and causing the bandarilleros to  leap over the railing among the spectators--or when, after a defeated  effort or a successful attack, he stands majestically in the middle  of the area, scraping up the sand with his hoof, foaming at the mouth,  and quivering in every fibre with rage, agony, or indignation, looking  towards his adversaries, and meditating a fatal rush--the sight combines  every element of interest and agitation which can be found in contempt  of danger, in surprising boldness, and great animal force intensely  excited. The horns of the Spanish bull are always sharp, and never  covered. An animal of sufficient power and spirit to command popular  applause frequently kills five or six horses, the riders taking care to  fall over on the side most distant from the enemy, and being instantly  relieved from their perilous situation by the bandarilleros, who attract  his attention: and the bull himself is always killed in the ring by the  _matador_, who enters in on foot with his bright flag in the left  hand, and his sword in the right, and who, standing before the enraged  animal waiting the favourable moment when he bends his head to toss  him on his horns, plunges his sword into his neck or spine in such a  fatal manner that he frequently falls instantaneously as if struck by  lightning. This last operation is as dangerous as it is dexterous.  At the moment in which the matador hits the bull, the pointed horn must  be within an inch or two of his heart, and if he were to fail he must  himself be the victim. When he succeeds in levelling to the ground with  a single stroke his furious and irresistible enemy, the music strikes  up, the applauses of the amphitheatre are showered upon the conqueror,  he stalks proudly round the area, strewed with dead horses, and reddened  with blood, bowing first to the judges of the fight, and then to the  spectators, and leaves the place amid enthusiastic _vivas_ for his  successful audacity. The field of slaughter is then cleared by a yoke of  horses, richly decorated with plumes on their heads and ribands on their  manes, to which the dead bull or horses are attached, and by which they  are dragged out at a gallop. That no part of the amusement may want its  appropriate parade, this operation goes on amid the sound of a trumpet,  or the playing of a military band. The horsemen are then remounted anew,  and enter on fresh steeds--the door of the den is again opened--another  furious animal is let loose on the possessors of the ring, till ten or  twelve are thus sacrificed.    The bull-fights in Lisbon are a very inferior species of amusement to  this, though much better than I was led to anticipate. Here the bulls  are generally not so strong or so spirited as the Spanish breed. In the  morning of the sport, the tips of their horns, instead of being left  sharp, are covered with cork and leather. None but one horseman appeared  in the ring at a time--no havoc was of course made among the horses;  bulls were introduced and baited without being killed, and the matador,  though he sometimes displays the same dexterity, never encounters the  same danger as in Spain. In Lisbon the most interesting part of the  sport consists in an operation which could not be practised in Spain,  and is conducted by performers who are unknown where bull-fighting is  more sanguinary. These performers are what they call here _homens de  furcado_, or men of the fork; so denominated from their bearing a  fork with which they push or strike the head of the bull, when he throws  down a man or a horse. After the bull, not destined to be killed, has  afforded amusement enough, these men go up before him, one of them  trying to get in between his horns, or to cling to his neck, till the  rest surround, master him, and lead him out of the area. The _man of  the fork_, who gets between the bull's horns, is sometimes tossed in  the air or dashed to the ground, and in this one of the chief dangers of  the fight consists. On Sunday one of them was dashed down so violently  as to be carried out of the ring in a state of insensibility. Only four  bulls were killed out of the twelve exhibited. The rest being reserved  for future sport, were either dragged out of the ring in the manner  above described, or, when supposed to be too strong to be mastered  by the men of the fork, were tamely driven out among a flock of oxen  introduced into the area as a decoy. Another peculiarity of the Lisbon  bull-fights is the presence of a buffoon on horseback called the  _Neto_, who first enters the ring to take the commands of the  _Inspector_, and occasionally bears the shock of the bull, to  the no small diversion of the lower class of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1261"],[0,"Betty Zane (#5)"],[1,"riousness.  But it was not that which angered Betty. It was the coolness with  which he still held her pony regardless of her commands.    \"Pray do not get excited,\" he said. \"I am sorry I cannot allow such  a pretty little girl to have her own way. I shall hold your pony  until you say you will go back to the fort.\"    \"Sir!\" exclaimed Betty, blushing a bright-red. \"You--you are  impertinent!\"    \"Not at all,\" answered Alfred, with a pleasant laugh. \"I am sure I  do not intend to be. Captain Boggs did not acquaint me with full  particulars or I might have declined my present occupation: not,  however, that it is not agreeable just at this moment. He should  have mentioned the danger of my being run down by Indian ponies and  imperious young ladies.\"    \"Will you let go of that bridle, or shall I get off and walk back  for assistance?\" said Betty, getting angrier every moment.    \"Go back to the fort at once,\" ordered Alfred, authoritatively.  \"Captain Boggs' orders are that no one shall be allowed to leave the  clearing.\"    \"Oh! Why did you not say so? I thought you were Simon Girty, or a  highwayman. Was it necessary to keep me here all this time to  explain that you were on duty?\"    \"You know sometimes it is difficult to explain,\" said Alfred,  \"besides, the situation had its charm. No, I am not a robber, and I  don't believe you thought so. I have only thwarted a young lady's  whim, which I am aware is a great crime. I am very sorry. Goodbye.\"    Betty gave him a withering glance from her black eyes, wheeled her  pony and galloped away. A mellow laugh was borne to her ears before  she got out of hearing, and again the red blood mantled her cheeks.    \"Heavens! What a little beauty,\" said Alfred to himself, as he  watched the graceful rider disappear. \"What spirit! Now, I wonder  who she can be. She had on moccasins and buckskin gloves and her  hair tumbled like a tomboy's, but she is no backwoods girl, I'll bet  on that. I'm afraid I was a little rude, but after taking such a  stand I could not weaken, especially before such a haughty and  disdainful little vixen. It was too great a temptation. What eyes  she had! Contrary to what I expected, this little frontier  settlement bids fair to become interesting.\"    The afternoon wore slowly away, and until late in the day nothing  further happened to disturb Alfred's meditations, which consisted  chiefly of different mental views and pictures of red lips and black  eyes. Just as he decided to return to the fort for his supper he  heard the barking of a dog that he had seen running along the road  some moments before. The sound came from some distance down the  river bank and nearer the fort. Walking a few paces up the bluff  Alfred caught sight of a large black dog running along the edge of  the water. He would run into the water a few paces and then come out  and dash along the shore. He barked furiously all the while. Alfred  concluded that he must have been excited by a fox or perhaps a wolf;  so he climbed down the steep bank and spoke to the dog. Thereupon  the dog barked louder and more fiercely than ever, ran to the water,  looked out into the river and then up at the man with almost human  intelligence.    Alfred understood. He glanced out over the muddy water, at first  making out nothing but driftwood. Then suddenly he saw a log with an  object clinging to it which he took to be a man, and an Indian at  that. Alfred raised his rifle to his shoulder and was in the act of  pressing the trigger when he thought he heard a faint halloo.  Looking closer, he found he was not covering the smooth polished  head adorned with the small tuft of hair, peculiar to a redskin on  the warpath, but a head from which streamed long black hair.    Alfred lowered his rifle and studied intently the log with its human  burden. Drifting with the current it gradually approached the bank,  and as it came nearer he saw that it bore a white man, who was  holding to the log with one hand and with the other was making  feeble strokes. He concluded the man was either wounded or nearly  drowned, for his movements were becoming slower and weaker every  moment. His white face lay against the log and barely above water.  Alfred shouted encouraging words to him.    At the bend of the river a little rocky point jutted out a few yards  into the water. As the current carried the log toward this point,  Alfred, after divesting himself of some of his clothing, plunged in  and pulled it to the shore. The pallid face of the man clinging to  the log showed that he was nearly exhausted, and that he had been  rescued in the nick of time. When Alfred reached shoal water he  slipped his arm around the man, who was unable to stand, and carried  him ashore.    The rescued man wore a buckskin hunting shirt and leggins and  moccasins of the same material, all very much the worse for wear.  The leggins were torn into tatters and the moccasins worn through.  His face was pinched with suffering and one arm was bleeding from a  gunshot wound near the shoulder.    \"Can you not speak? Who are you?\" asked Clarke, supporting the limp  figure.    The man made several efforts to answer, and finally said something  that to Alfred sounded like \"Zane,\" then he fell to the ground  unconscious.    All this time the dog had acted in a most peculiar manner, and if  Alfred had not been so intent on the man he would have noticed the  animal's odd maneuvers. He ran to and fro on the sandy beach; he  scratched up the sand and pebbles, sending them flying in the air;  he made short, furious dashes; he jumped, whirled, and, at last,  crawled close to the motionless figure and licked its hand.    Clarke realized that he would not be able to carry the inanimate  figure, so he hurriedly put on his clothes and set out on a run for  Colonel Zane's house. The first person whom he saw was the old negro  slave, who was brushing one of the Colonel's horses.    Sam was deliberate and took his time about everything. He slowly  looked up and surveyed Clarke with his rolling eyes. He did not  recognize in him any one he had ever seen before, and being of a  sullen and taciturn nature, especially with strangers, he seemed in  no hurry to give the desired information as to Colonel Zane's  whereabouts.    \"Don't stare at me that way, you damn nigger,\" said Clarke, who was  used to being obeyed by negroes. \"Quick, you idiot. Where is the  Colonel?\"    At that moment Colonel Zane came out of the barn and started to  speak, when Clarke interrupted him.    \"Colonel, I have just pulled a man out of the river who says his  name is Zane, or if he did not mean that, he knows you, for he  surely said 'Zane.'\"    \"What!\" ejaculated the Colonel, letting his pipe fall from his  mouth.    Clarke related the circumstances in a few hurried words. Calling Sam  they ran quickly down to the river, where they found the prostrate  figure as Clarke had left it, the dog still crouched close by.    \"My God! It is Isaac!\" exclaimed Colonel Zane, when he saw the white  face. \"Poor boy, he looks as if he were dead. Are you sure he spoke?  Of course he must have spoken for you could not have known. Yes, his  heart is still beating.\"    Colonel Zane raised his head from the unconscious man's breast,  where he had laid it to listen for the beating heart.    \"Clarke, God bless you for saving him,\" said he fervently. \"It shall  never be forgotten. He is alive, and, I believe, only exhausted, for  that wound amounts to little. Let us hurry.\"    \"I did not save him. It was the dog,\" Alfred made haste to answer.    They carried the dripping form to the house, where the door was  opened by Mrs. Zane.    \"Oh, dear, another poor man,\" she said, pityingly. Then, as she saw  his face, \"Great Heavens, it is Isaac! Oh! don't say he is dead!\"    \"Yes, it is Isaac, and he is worth any number of dead men yet,\" said  Colonel Zane, as they laid the insensible man on the couch. \"Bessie,  there is work here for you. He has been shot.\"    \"Is there any other wound beside this one in his arm?\" asked Mrs.  Zane, examining it.    \"I do not think so, and that injury is not serious. It is lose of  blood, exposure and starvation. Clarke, will you please run over to  Captain Boggs and tell Betty to hurry home! Sam, you get a blanket  and warm it by the fire. That's right, Bessie, bring the whiskey,\"  and Colonel Zane went on giving orders.    Alfred did not know in the least who Betty was, but, as he thought  that unimportant, he started off on a run for the fort. He had a  vague idea that Betty was the servant, possibly Sam's wife, or some  one of the Colonel's several slaves.    Let us return to Betty. As she wheeled her pony and rode away from  the scene of her adventure on the river bluff, her state of mind can  be more readily imagined than described. Betty hated opposition of  any kind, whether justifiable or not; she wanted her own way, and  when prevented from doing as she pleased she invariably got angry.  To be ordered and compelled to give up her ride, and that by a  stranger, was intolerable. To make it all the worse this stranger  had been decidedly flippant. He had familiarly spoken to her as \"a  pretty little girl.\" Not only that, which was a great offense, but  he had stared at her, and she had a confused recollection of a gaze  in which admiration had been ill disguised. Of course, it was that  soldier Lydia had been telling her about. Strangers were of so rare  an occurrence in the little village that it was not probable there  could be more than one.    Approaching the house she met her brother who told her she had  better go indoors and let Sam put up the pony. Accordingly, Betty  called the negro, and then went into the house. Bessie had gone to  the fort with the children. Betty found no one to talk to, so she  tried to read. Finding she could not become interested she threw the  book aside and took up her embroidery. This also turned out a  useless effort; she got the"]]]
