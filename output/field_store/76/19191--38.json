If the condition of the  development of philosophy in India had been the same as in Europe,  definite chronological knowledge would be considered much more  indispensable. For, when one system supersedes another, it is  indispensably necessary that we should know which preceded and which  succeeded. But when the systems are developing side by side, and when  we are getting them in their richer and better forms, the interest with  regard to the conditions, nature and environment of their early origin  has rather a historical than a philosophical interest. I have tried as  best I could to form certain general notions as regards the earlier  stages of some of the systems, but though the various features of  these systems at these stages in detail may not be ascertainable,  yet this, I think, could never be considered as invalidating the  whole programme. Moreover, even if we knew definitely the correct dates  of the thinkers of the same system we could not treat them separately,  as is done in European philosophy, without unnecessarily repeating the  same thing twenty times over; for they all dealt with the same system,  and tried to bring out the same type of thought in more and more  determinate forms.    The earliest literature of India is the Vedas. These consist mostly of  hymns in praise of nature gods, such as fire, wind, etc. Excepting in  some of the hymns of the later parts of the work (probably about 1000  B.C.), there is not much philosophy in them in our sense of the term.  It is here that we first find intensely interesting philosophical  questions of a more or less cosmological character expressed in terms  of poetry and imagination. In the later Vedic works called the  Brahmaf@nas and the Ara@nyakas written mostly in prose, which followed  the Vedic hymns, there are two tendencies, viz. one that sought to  establish the magical forms of ritualistic worship, and the other which  indulged in speculative thinking through crude generalizations. This  latter tendency was indeed much feebler than the former, and it might  appear that the ritualistic tendency had actually swallowed up what  little of philosophy the later parts of the Vedic hymns were trying  to express, but there are unmistakable marks that this tendency    7    existed and worked. Next to this come certain treatises written in prose  and verse called the Upani@sads, which contain various sorts of  philosophical thoughts mostly monistic or singularistic but also some  pluralistic and dualistic ones. These are not reasoned statements, but  utterances of truths intuitively perceived or felt as unquestionably real  and indubitable, and carrying great force, vigour, and persuasiveness with  them. It is very probable that many of the earliest parts of this  literature are as old as 500 B.C. to 700 B.C. Buddhist philosophy began  with the Buddha from some time about 500 B.C. There is reason to believe  that Buddhist philosophy continued to develop in India in one or other of  its vigorous forms till some time about the tenth or eleventh century A.D.  The earliest beginnings of the other Indian systems of thought are also to  be sought chiefly between the age of the Buddha to about 200 B.C. Jaina  philosophy was probably prior to the Buddha. But except in its earlier  days, when it came in conflict with the doctrines of the Buddha, it  does not seem to me that the Jaina thought came much in contact with  other systems of Hindu thought. Excepting in some forms of Vai@s@nava  thought in later times, Jaina thought is seldom alluded to by the Hindu  writers or later Buddhists, though some Jains like Haribhadra and  Gu@naratna tried to refute the Hindu and Buddhist systems. The  non-aggressive nature of their religion and ideal may to a certain  extent explain it, but there may be other reasons too which it is  difficult for us to guess. It is interesting to note that, though there  have been some dissensions amongst the Jains about dogmas and creeds,  Jaina philosophy has not split into many schools of thought more or less  differing from one another as Buddhist thought did.    The first volume of this work will contain Buddhist and Jaina philosophy  and the six systems of Hindu thought. These six systems of orthodox  Hindu thought are the Sa@mkhya, the Yoga, the Nyaya, the Vais'e@sika,  the Mima@msa (generally known as Purva Mima@msa), and the Vedanta (known  also as Uttara Mima@msa). Of these what is differently known as Sa@mkhya  and Yoga are but different schools of one system. The Vais'e@sika and  the Nyaya in later times became so mixed up that, though in early times  the similarity of the former with Mima@msa was greater than that  with Nyaya, they came to be regarded as fundamentally almost the  same systems. Nyaya and Vais'e@sika have therefore been treated    8    together. In addition to these systems some theistic systems began  to grow prominent from the ninth century A.D. They also probably  had their early beginnings at the time of the Upani@sads. But at  that time their interest was probably concentrated on problems  of morality and religion. It is not improbable that these were  associated with certain metaphysical theories also, but no works  treating them in a systematic way are now available. One of their most  important early works is the _Bhagavadgata_. This book is rightly  regarded as one of the greatest masterpieces of Hindu thought. It is  written in verse, and deals with moral, religious, and metaphysical  problems, in a loose form. It is its lack of system and method which  gives it its peculiar charm more akin to the poetry of the Upani@sads  than to the dialectical and systematic Hindu thought. From the ninth  century onwards attempts were made to supplement these loose theistic  ideas which were floating about and forming integral parts of religious  creeds, by metaphysical theories. Theism is often dualistic and  pluralistic, and so are all these systems, which are known as different  schools of Vai@s@nava philosophy. Most of the Vai@s@nava thinkers wished  to show that their systems were taught in the Upani@sads, and thus  wrote commentaries thereon to prove their interpretations, and also wrote  commentaries on the _Brahmasutra_, the classical exposition of the  philosophy of the Upani@sads. In addition to the works of these Vai@s@nava  thinkers there sprang up another class of theistic works which were of a  more eclectic nature. These also had their beginnings in periods as old  as the Upani@sads. They are known as the S'aiva and Tantra thought, and are  dealt with in the second volume of this work.    We thus see that the earliest beginnings of most systems of Hindu thought  can be traced to some time between 600 B.C. to 100 or 200 B.C. It is  extremely difficult to say anything about the relative priority of the  systems with any degree of certainty. Some conjectural attempts have  been made in this work with regard to some of the systems, but how far  they are correct, it will be for our readers to judge. Moreover during  the earliest manifestation of a system some crude outlines only are  traceable. As time went on the systems of thought began to develop  side by side. Most of them were taught from the time in which they  were first conceived to about the seventeenth century A.D. in an  unbroken chain of teachers and pupils. Even now each system of  Hindu thought has its own adherents, though few people now    9    care to write any new works upon them. In the history of the growth of  any system of Hindu thought we find that as time went on, and as new  problems were suggested, each system tried to answer them consistently  with its own doctrines. The order in which we have taken the  philosophical systems could not be strictly a chronological one. Thus  though it is possible that the earliest speculations of some form of  Sa@mkhya, Yoga, and Mima@msa were prior to Buddhism yet they have been  treated after Buddhism and Jainism, because the elaborate works of these  systems which we now possess are later than Buddhism. In my opinion the  Vais'e@sika system is also probably pre-Buddhistic, but it has been  treated later, partly on account of its association with Nyaya, and  partly on account of the fact that all its commentaries are of a much  later date. It seems to me almost certain that enormous quantities of  old philosophical literature have been lost, which if found could have  been of use to us in showing the stages of the early growth of the systems  and their mutual relations. But as they are not available we have to be  satisfied with what remains. The original sources from which I have drawn  my materials have all been indicated in the brief accounts of the  literature of each system which I have put in before beginning the study  of any particular system of thought.    In my interpretations I have always tried to follow the original sources  as accurately as I could. This has sometimes led to old and unfamiliar  modes of expression, but this course seemed to me to be preferable to  the adoption of European modes of thought for the expression of Indian  ideas. But even in spite of this striking similarities to many of the  modern philosophical doctrines and ideas will doubtless be noticed.  This only proves that the human mind follows more or less the same modes  of rational thought. I have never tried to compare any phase of Indian  thought with European, for this is beyond the scope of my present  attempt, but if I may be allowed to express my own conviction, I might  say that many of the philosophical doctrines of European philosophy are  essentially the same as those found in Indian philosophy. The main  difference is often the difference of the point of view from which the  same problems appeared in such a variety of forms in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12975"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#5)"],[1,"impossible that they can be in the place which Dr. Layard has  explored; and, moreover, the Assyrian-like sculptures and inscriptions  found in the supposed Nineveh, were the work of a later, and a  different people, who had the affectation of imitating Assyrian taste.           *       *       *       *       *    Both Rogers and Wilson, it is said, have declined the laureateship.

GEN. ANDRE SANTA CRUZ.    This valiant soldier has lately arrived in London as Minister  Plenipotentiary from the Republic of Bolivia to the English Court. He  before visited Europe in the character of exile, but his misfortune  is in a measure repaid by the importance and dignity of his present  position.    General Andre Santa Cruz was born in 1794, at La Paz, the capital of  one of the provinces of Bolivia, and is a direct descendant, through  his mother, from the Incas of Peru. He began his military career  immediately upon quitting college, in the Spanish army, wherein he  attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He joined the liberating army  in 1820, when Peru proclaimed her independence, and by his valor and  tactics, largely contributed to maintain the proclamation. In 1821,  as a reward for his services, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel,  and in conjunction with General Sucre, assisted to raise the standard  of liberty in the State of Ecuador. It was in the course of this  campaign that the battle of Pichincha was fought in which Santa  Cruz distinguished himself at the head of the advanced guard. These  services attracted the attention of General Bolivar, and won for  him the rank of General of Brigade. He was next engaged with General  Bolivar in the celebrated campaigns of Xemiu and Ayacucho, which  closed the wars of independence, in 1824.    The achievements of General Santa Cruz in the course of these  campaigns were rewarded by the dignity of Grand Marshal of Peru,  and the government of the departments of Chuquisaca and La Paz. His  sagacious administration in his latter capacity marked him out as the  fittest Governor of Peru, to which high post he was quickly nominated  by his admirer and friend General Bolivar. The national records of  this period bear ample testimony to the enlightened policy and the  systematic prudence with which General Santa Cruz presided over the  destinies of Peru. He retired from his post in 1827, in consequence  of the defection of part of the army from his staunch friend Bolivar,  and accepted the comparatively insignificant appointment of Minister  Plenipotentiary to the Governments of Chili and Buenos Ayres. In 1829,  a serious rebellion, that threatened irretrievable disasters, having  broken out in the Republic of Bolivia, the friends of order appealed  to their old friend General Santa Cruz as being the only man capable  of re-establishing public tranquillity. His firmness and mercy had the  rapid effect of calming the excited spirits of the rebels; and as soon  as public confidence was restored, he placed the financial affairs  of the country on a firm footing, and in conjunction with wise  counselors, drew up the civil and penal codes, which were published  within the period of his discretional government. In 1831, the  National Congress elected him Constitutional President of Bolivia and  Captain-General of the national forces; and, moreover, confirmed the  clause in the will of General Bolivar, which bequeathed the medal of  honor to him. His occupation of the Presidential chair, to which he  was reelected in 1835, was marked by unusual commercial and financial  prosperity, and the yearly revenue always exceeded the annual  expenditure. He paid great attention, also, to the diffusion of  knowledge.    Peru, harassed and divided by internal dissension, turned, as his  native country had turned in the hour of trouble, to General Santa  Cruz. It was proposed to form a confederation of the two republics.  This proposition was carried out and solemnly ratified in 1835;  whereupon the Peruvians, under the protection of their former chief  magistrate, laid down arms, and prepared to enjoy the blessings  of peace. The Confederation was confirmed by a convocation of the  Congresses of Cicuani, Huawra, and Tapacari, in 1836, and General  Santa Cruz was named \"Protector of the Confederation.\" In his capacity  of Protector, the General made a triumphant entry into Lima, in 1837,  where the deliberations of a General Congress of the Confederation  were at once opened, and the constitution of the Confederation was  determined upon. The Protector's liberal policy had secured the  sympathy and esteem of all enlightened nations, gave an impetus to  native enterprise and industry, and above all, restored the credit of  Peru by acknowledging and liquidating the English liabilities. This  prosperous state of things was suddenly checked by the appearance  of a hostile Chilian fleet, which seized upon the fleet of the  Confederation in the port of Callao, without any previous declaration  of war, and by the landing of a Chilian expedition on the Intermedios,  accompanied by a handful of Peruvians who were hostile to the  Confederation. This expedition was soon subdued by the skill of  General Santa Cruz, who exacted from it the treaty of Paucaupata, and  then allowed free egress from the territory of the Confederation. This  generosity on the part of the Protector was met by treachery on the  part of Chili, directly her army was once more on Chilian ground. At  this time the Government of Buenos Ayres made an unsuccessful attack  upon the Confederation. The enemies without having been successfully  repulsed, the prosperous condition of the Confederation continued,  till General Orbegoso, one of the founders of the Confederation,  rebelled, and enlisted the troops under his command in his Cause.  This internal rebellion afforded a fresh and favorable opportunity  for renewed hostility from without, and the result was that within a  short space of time Chilian troops occupied Lima. On the appearance of  General Santa Cruz, however, the foes were compelled to evacuate and  re-embark. Defeated in this direction, the Chilian troops directed  their course to the northern provinces, where Orbegoso's rebel band  were collected. Gen. Santa Cruz, in the ardor of his determination  to rid the territory of the Confederation from this treacherous foe,  undertook a march of two hundred leagues, under the severity of which  many of his troops sank, and the result of which was his defeat at  Yungay, by the rebel forces. The defection of Generals Ballivian  and Velasco, who commanded two powerful divisions of the army of the  Confederation, made this disaster irretrievable. General Santa Cruz  was obliged to retire to Guayaquil, whence he subsequently betook  himself with his family to Europe. He has lately been accredited by  his native country Minister Plenipotentiary in London and Paris.    There are few public men who have held so many important public trusts  with such universal popularity. The liberality of the General's views,  his sagacity in council, and above all, the purity of his patriotism  and the unselfish nature of his administrations, are claims upon the  gratitude of South America that will command wider recognition in  times to come even than they obtain at the present time.           *       *       *       *       *    THE CELL OF THE BEE.--Hive-bees not only differ from wasps in building  their comb with material secreted by themselves, but they also differ  in the mode in which they construct their cells.
