There were only two chairs, but the younger of the strangers  immediately made himself comfortable on the bed.    \"My name's Doone,\" he said, \"and this is Mr. William Gregg. We think  that you have some information which we can use. Mind if we fire a few  questions?\"    \"Certainly not,\" said Robert Macklin. At the same time he began to arm  himself with caution. One could never tell.    \"Matter of fact,\" went on Ronicky smoothly, lighting a tailor-made  cigarette, while his companion rolled one of his own making, \"we are  looking for a lady who was on one of your trains. We think you may  possibly remember her. Here's the picture.\"    And, as he passed the snapshot to the Pullman conductor, he went on  with the details of the date and the number of the train.    Robert Macklin in the meantime studied the picture carefully. He had a  keen eye for faces, but when it came to pretty faces his memory was a  veritable lion. He had talked a few moments with this very girl, and  she had smiled at him. The memory made Robert Macklin's lips twitch  just a trifle, and Ronicky Doone saw it.    Presently the dignitary returned the picture and raised his head from  thought. \"It is vaguely behind my mind, something about this lady,\" he  said. \"But I'm sorry to say, gentlemen, I really don't know you and--\"    \"Why, don't you know us!\" broke in Bill Gregg. \"Ain't my partner here  just introduced us?\"    \"Exactly,\" said Robert Macklin. And his opinion of the two sank a full  hundred points. Such grammar proclaimed a ruffian.    \"You don't get his drift,\" Ronicky was explaining to his companion. \"I  introduced us, but he doesn't know who I am. We should have brought  along a letter of introduction.\" He turned to Macklin. \"I am mighty  sorry I didn't get one,\" he said.    It came to Macklin for the fraction of a second that he was being  mocked, but he instantly dismissed the foolish thought. Even the rough  fellows must be able to recognize a man when they saw one.    \"The point is,\" went on Ronicky gently, \"that my friend is very eager  for important reasons to see this lady, to find her. And he doesn't  even know her name.\" Here his careful grammar gave out with a crash.  \"You can't beat a deal like that, eh, Macklin? If you can remember  anything about her, her name first, then, where she was bound, who was  with her, how tall she is, the color of her eyes, we'd be glad to know  anything you know. What can you do for us?\"    Macklin cleared his throat thoughtfully. \"Gentlemen,\" he said gravely,  \"if I knew the purpose for which you are seeking the lady I--\"    \"The purpose ain't to kidnap her, if that's your drift,\" said Ronicky.  \"We ain't going to treat her wrong, partner. Out in our part of  the land they don't do it. Just shake up your thoughts and see if  something about that girl doesn't pop right into your head.\"    Robert Macklin smiled and carefully shook his head. \"It seems to be  impossible for me to remember a thing,\" he asserted.    \"Not even the color of her eyes?\" asked Ronicky, as he grinned. He  went on more gravely: \"I'm pretty dead sure that you do remember  something about her.\"    There was just the shade of a threat in the voice of this slender  youngster, and Robert Macklin had been an amateur pugilist of much  brawn and a good deal of boxing skill. He cast a wary eye on Ronicky;  one punch would settle that fellow. The man Gregg might be a harder  nut to crack, but it would not take long to finish them both. Robert  Macklin thrust his shoulders forward.    \"Friends,\" he said gruffly, \"I don't have much time off. This is my  day for rest. I have to say good-by.\"    Ronicky Doone stood up with a yawn. \"I thought so,\" he said to his  companion. \"Mind the door, Gregg, and see that nobody steps in and  busts up my little party.\"    \"What are you going to do?\"    \"Going to argue with this gent in a way he'll understand a pile better  than the chatter we've been making so far.\" He stepped a long light  pace forward. \"Macklin, you know what we want to find out. Will you  talk?\"    A cloud of red gathered before the eyes of Macklin. It was impossible  that he must believe his ears, and yet the words still rang there.    \"Why, curse your little rat-face!\" burst out Robert Macklin, and,  stepping in, he leaned forward with a perfect straight left.    Certainly his long vacation from boxing had not ruined his eye or  stiffened his muscles. With delight he felt all the big sinews about  his shoulders come into play. Straight and true the big fist drove  into the face of the smaller man, but Robert Macklin found that he had  punched a hole in thin air. It was as if the very wind of the blow had  brushed the head of Ronicky Doone to one side, and at the same time he  seemed to sway and stagger forward.    A hard lean fist struck Robert Macklin's body. As he gasped and  doubled up, clubbing his right fist to land the blow behind the ear  of Ronicky Doone, the latter bent back, stepped in and, rising on the  toes of both feet, whipped a perfect uppercut that, in ring parlance,  rang the bell.    The result was that Robert Macklin, his mouth agape and his eyes dull,  stood wobbling slowly from side to side.    \"Here!\" called Ronicky to his companion at the door. \"Grab him on one  side, and I'll take the other. He's out on his feet. Get him to that  chair.\" With Gregg's assistance he dragged the bulk of the man there.  Macklin was still stunned.    Presently the dull eyes cleared and filled immediately with horror.  Big Robert Macklin sank limply back in the chair.    \"I've no money,\" he said. \"I swear I haven't a cent in the place. It's  in the bank, but if a check will--\"    \"We don't want your money this trip,\" said Ronicky. \"We want talk,  Macklin. A lot of talk and a lot of true talk. Understand? It's about  that girl. I saw you grin when you saw the picture; you remember her  well enough. Now start talking, and remember this, if you lie, I'll  come back here and find out and use this on you.\"    The eyes of Robert Macklin started from his head, as his gaze  concentrated on the black muzzle of the gun. He moistened his white  lips and managed to gasp: \"Everything I know, of course. Ill tell you  everything, word for word. She--she--her name I mean--\"    \"You're doing fine,\" said Ronicky. \"Keep it up, and you keep away,  Bill. When you come at him with that hungry look he thinks you're  going to eat him up. Fire away, Macklin.\"    \"What first?\"    \"What's she look like?\"    \"Soft brown hair, blue eyes, her mouth--\"    \"Is a little big. That's all right. You don't have to be polite and  lie. We want the truth. How big is she?\"    \"About five feet and five inches, must weigh around a hundred and  thirty pounds.\"    \"You sure are an expert on the ladies, Macklin, and I'll bet you  didn't miss her name?\"    \"Her name?\"    \"Don't tell me you missed out on that!\"    \"No. It was--Just a minute!\"    \"Take your time.\"    \"Caroline.\"    \"Take your time now, Macklin, you're doing fine. Don't get confused.  Get the last name right. It's the most important to us.\"    \"I have it, I'm sure. The whole name is Caroline Smith.\"    There was a groan from Ronicky Doone and another from Bill Gregg.    \"That's a fine name to use for trailing a person. Did she say anything  more, anything about where she expected to be living in New York?\"    \"I don't remember any more,\" said Macklin sullenly, for the spot where  Ronicky's fist landed on his jaw was beginning to ache. \"I didn't sit  down and have any chats with her. She just spoke to me once in a while  when I did something for her. I suppose you fellows have some crooked  work on hand for her?\"    \"We're bringing her good news,\" said Ronicky calmly. \"Now see if you  can't remember where she said she lived in New York.\" And he gave  added point to his question by pressing the muzzle of the revolver  a little closer to the throat of the Pullman conductor. The latter  blinked and swallowed hard.    \"The only thing I remember her saying was that she could see the East  River from her window, I think.\"    \"And that's all you know?\"    \"Yes, not a thing more about her to save my life.\"    \"Maybe what you know has saved it,\" said Ronicky darkly.    His victim eyed him with sullen malevolence. \"Maybe there'll be a new  trick or two in this game before it's finished. I'll never forget you,  Doone, and you, Gregg.\"    \"You haven't a thing in the world on us,\" replied Ronicky.    \"I have the fact that you carry concealed weapons.\"    \"Only this time.\"    \"Always! Fellows like you are as lonesome without a gun as they are  without a skin.\"    Ronicky turned at the door and laughed back at the gloomy face, and  then they were gone down the steps and into the street.          Chapter Six      _The New York Trail_    On the train to New York that night they carefully summed up their  prospects and what they had gained.    \"We started at pretty near nothing,\" said Ronicky. He was a  professional optimist. \"We had a picture of a girl, and we knew she  was on a certain train bound East, three or four weeks ago. That's all  we knew. Now we know her name is Caroline Smith, and that she lives  where she can see the East River out of her back window. I guess that  narrows it down pretty close, doesn't it, Bill?\"    \"Close?\" asked Bill. \"Close, did you say?\" \"Well, we know the trail,\"  said Ronicky cheerily. \"All we've got to do is to locate the shack  that stands beside that trail. For old mountain men like us that ought  to be nothing. What sort of a stream is this East River, though?\"    Bill Gregg looked at his companion in disgust. He had become so  used to regarding Doone as entirely infallible that it amazed and  disheartened him to find that there was one topic so large about which  Ronicky knew nothing.

Volume 20, No. 568, (#5)"],[1,"run out, and fresh appeals are to be made.  Let us glance at the contents of, the _Voice_ before us. The subject  \"Abattoirs contrasted with Slaughter-houses and Smithfield-market,\"  is continued--a plan which we illustrated in _The Mirror_ about five  years since. True enough the Society write, but the people do not  consider; they are so wedded to old prejudices and habits, and the  mammon of money, that pestilential slaughter-houses are tolerated in  the midst of a \"city of the plague,\" notwithstanding a law exists for  its prevention. Four hospitals are building in the metropolis--and  markets are increasing for the sale of the necessaries and luxuries of  life; the _Haymarket_ has been removed from a fashionable quarter to  the suburbs, that loaded carts may not obstruct carriages in their  road to St. James's, the Houses of Parliament, and the Opera--yet, not  a single, _Abattoir_--for the health of the people--exists near the  metropolis. The King and the Court patronize and plan horse-racing,  throwing the lasso, and, if recent report be true, hawking; the  Parliament legislate, a bill is \"ordered to be printed\"--yet, the  inconsistency and tardiness of these proceedings compel us to  ask, where is the truth of the motto--_Salus populi suprema lex_.  Convictions before magistrates for acts of cruelty are not uncommon;  yet, it is in this, as in many other laws, the poor are caught, while  the rich break through the meshes of the net. In the work before us  are recorded Mr. Osbaldeston's matches, including \"the cold-blooded  cruelty towards the generous and heart-broken _Rattler_, in riding him  thirty-four miles in the space of 2 hours, 18 min., and 56 sec.\" Next  are four police cases of cruelties towards horses, bullocks, and cats,  the persons convicted being \"of low estate.\" Yet there follows the  fact of _a respectable woman_ boiling a cat to death! and next is this  quotation from the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for April, 1789:--    \"Died, April 4, at Tottenham, John Ardesoif, Esq.; a young man of  large fortune, and in the splendour of his carriages and horses  rivalled by few country gentlemen. His table was that of hospitality,  where it may be said he sacrificed too much to conviviality. Mr.  Ardesoif was fond of cock-fighting, and he had a favourite cock upon  which he had won many profitable matches. The last bet he made upon  this cock he lost; which so enraged him, that he had the bird tied  to a spit, and roasted alive before a large fire. The screams of  the miserable animal were so affecting, that some gentlemen who were  present attempted to interfere, which so exasperated Mr. Ardesoif,  that he seized the poker; and, with the most furious vehemence,  declared that he would kill the first man who interfered; but, in the  midst of his passionate assertions, he fell down dead upon the spot!\"    If we be asked whether it be proper to regard _all_ such dispensations  as judicial inflictions, we reply in the words of Cowper above:      \"'Tis not for us, with rash surmise,    To point the judgments of the skies,      But judgments _plain as this_,    That, sent for man's instruction, bring    A written label on their wing,      'Tis hard to read amiss.\"    [A contribution full of touching simplicity follows:]    THE WORM.      Turn, turn, thy hasty foot aside      Nor crush that helpless worm;    The frame thy wayward looks deride,      Required a God to form.      The common Lord of all that move,      From whom thy being flowed,    A portion of his boundless love      On that poor worm bestowed.      The sun, the moon, the stars, he made      To all his creatures free;    And spread o'er earth the grassy blade      For worms as well as thee.      Let them enjoy their little day,      Their lowly hiss receive;    Oh! do not lightly take away      The life thou canst not give.    Here we may remark, that much wanton cruelty has been abolished by the  extended education of the people. Brutal sports among boys are much  less indulged than formerly, and the worrying of domestic animals  almost invariably denotes a _bad boy_, in the worst sense of the  phrase, likely to make a bad man; \"so true to nature is the admirable  aphorism of Wordsworth:--        The boy's the father of the man.\"    But we do not so much complain of boyish as of adult cruelties;  though, according to the above showing, such atrocities will be less  rare in the next than in the present generation. To conclude, we hope  that the present notice may awaken the sympathy of the reader towards  the laudable objects of the _Society_, under whose guidance the _Voice  of Humanity_ is published. It is a difficult matter to point out \"the  uneducated,\" and writers of all grades are eternally babbling of  our high state of civilization and refinement, yet, we repeat,  the necessity of this association is an anomaly which amounts to a  national disgrace.           *       *       *       *       *        THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.      VISIT TO THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT ETNA.      _BY LIEUTENANT G.H.P. WHITE, ROYAL NAVY._      On the evening of the 13th of July, 1830, I set off from Catania with  a party of my messmates, to ascend Mount Etna, taking the necessary  guides, and two sumpter mules to carry the provisions, &c., as nothing  in that way can be procured after leaving Nicolosi, which is a small  village about twelve miles from Catania. Etna is divided by the  Sicilians into three several regions. The first is called Pie de  Montagna, the second Nemerosa, and the third Discoperta. The ascent,  though very gradual, commences immediately on leaving the city of  Catania, over a tolerably constructed road; the country around is  formed on an ancient volcanic soil; probably the third eruption  mentioned by Thucydides, which happened in the sixth year of the  Peloponnesian war, and the second of the eighty-eighth Olympiad.  Traversing the lands of Battianti, and St. Giovanni della Punta, the  road is constantly over the lava, and the country on either side is  delicious. Trecastagne, nine miles from Catania, is seated on the  acclivity of a high volcanic mountain. The scene here is beautiful  and picturesque. Near the principal church the view is most extensive.  Towards the east the mountains of Calabria, the sea stretching  from Taormina to Catania, bathing the sides of Etna, covered with  vineyards, woods and villages: northward rises the mountain itself,  surrounded by its progeny of pigmy mountains; these have been thrown  up in various forms, composed principally of cinders, and covered with  rich vegetation. The freshness of the air, the beauty and picturesque  situations of the houses surrounded by lofty and fine trees, the  over-teeming fertility of the soil, and the laughing fields, where  golden Ceres still lingers, unwilling to quit her favourite abode,  intersected by courses of lava, as yet unproductive, make this view  one of the most beautiful and interesting that can be imagined. These  mighty streams of once liquid fire, extending in many places ten miles  in length, by two or three in breadth, fill the mind with horror and  astonishment: that such wondrous masses, consisting of earths, stones,  and minerals, fused and mixed, could be driven forth in one wild  current from the mountain, makes us pause, and confounds any attempt  to reason on the phenomena.--And, although the lava for many centuries  lays waste the superincumbent land, yet, after a certain, but very  long period, it is brought by human industry into such a state as to  become the richest soil for cultivation: but when we reflect on  the necessity of some ages to effect this wished-for state of  decomposition, we bewilder the mind without arriving at any certain  conclusion. When this process is duly effected, the cactus opuntia, or  prickly pear, is planted, which hastens the desired event, and has the  power to break up the lava, and render it fit for productive purposes.  Five miles from Trecastagne is Nicolosi, a small village which has  often suffered from the fire-vomiting mountain. Here we supped,  and baited the mules for two hours. Nicolosi, according to Signor  Gemmellero, a Sicilian physician, long resident at Catania, is two  thousand one hundred and twenty-eight feet above the level of the sea,  and its mean temperature 64 deg. Fahr.    From hence, to an almost interminable extent, there is a most superb  view of the surrounding country; nothing can be more varied, grand,  and sublime; every spot spared by the all-devastating lavas, is highly  cultivated; the vines and other productive fruit-trees are seen laden  with the most delicious fruits; the groves of olives, the towns and  villages, in almost endless aerial perspective, all terminated by the  distant and deep-blue sea, form a scene the most enchanting that can  be conceived. We remounted about ten o'clock, P.M., our trusty mules,  and pursued or journey. The evening was deliciously serene, the stars  shone with extraordinary brilliancy, and the sky appeared intensely  blue, while the galaxy, or milky way, beamed like a splendid stream of  light across the azure expanse.    The cool breezes now wafted from the upper regions of the mountain  were very refreshing, and exhilarated our spirits in an extraordinary  degree. Passed Monte Rosso, which is about 600 feet above the level of  the surrounding plain, and is said to have been thrown up during the  great eruption of the year 1669, and from which issued that horrible  stream of burning lava, which, after destroying the country for the  length of fourteen miles, ran into the sea at Catania.    About six miles higher up commences the Nemerosa region, which, like  a beautiful green girdle, encircles the mountain; it abounds with  ancient hillocks, and lava of different periods, and is almost  covered with frowning woods of oak, holm, beech and pines, on the more  elevated points.    After enjoying for some time this stupendous and enchanting"]]]
