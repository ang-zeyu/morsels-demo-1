[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10842"],[0,"The Life of Captain James Cook, the Circumnavigator (#5)"],[1,"Lord George Sackville, speaking in warm  terms of Boscawen and his men, and says:    \"Sir Charles Hardy, too, in particular, and all the officers of the Navy  in general have given us their utmost assistance, and with the greatest  cheerfulness imaginable. I have often been in pain for Sir Charles's  squadron at an anchor off the harbour's mouth. They rid out some very  hard gales of wind rather than leave an opening for the French to escape,  but, notwithstanding the utmost diligence on his side, a frigate found  means to get out and is gone to Europe charge de fanfaronades. I had the  satisfaction of putting 2 or 3 hautvizier shells into her stern and to  shatter him a little with some of your Lordship's 24 pound shot, before  he retreated, and I much question whether he will hold out the voyage.\"    The Pembroke formed one of this squadron under Sir Charles Hardy, and  after the capitulation of the town, was despatched with nine other ships,  and a small body of troops under Wolfe to harry the French settlements  around Gaspe Bay as a preparation for the attack on Quebec it was  intended to make in the following year. Several settlements and magazines  were destroyed, four guns and a pair of colours were captured, and then  the squadron returned to Halifax for the winter.    Admiral Sir Charles Saunders was selected to command the fleet that was  to be employed in this new movement against the capital of New France; a  man of whom Horace Walpole wrote:    \"The Admiral was a pattern of the most sturdy bravery, united with the  most unaffected modesty. No man said less, or deserved more. Simplicity  in his manners, generosity, and good-nature adorned his genuine love of  his country.\"    WITH DURELL'S SQUADRON.    He left Spithead on 17th February 1759, with the intention of calling at  Louisburg, the appointed rendezvous for the expedition, on his way to  Halifax; but the season had been so severe that Louisburg, usually free  from ice, was found to be unapproachable, so he went on, arriving at  Halifax on 30th April. Admiral Durell had been sent out earlier from  England, and was now despatched from Halifax with a squadron, of which  the Pembroke was one, to prevent, if possible, the entry into the river  of the usual spring fleet from France with supplies and reinforcements  for Quebec, and to keep the French from putting up any fortifications on  the Ile aux Coudres, thereby adding to the difficulties of the fleet in  ascending this dangerous portion of river. The weather was bad, and the  trouble caused by fog and ice so great that Durell found the fleet of 18  sail, convoyed by two frigates, had escaped him, but one or two small  store ships were captured which proved of service to the British  afterwards. On the way up the Gulf, Captain Simcoe of the Pembroke died,  and the ship was given temporarily to Lieutenant Collins of Durell's  ship, and afterwards to Captain Wheelock, who remained in her till after  Cook left.    Durell's squadron arrived off the Ile aux Coudres on the 25th, and on the  28th the Pembroke landed the troops she had on board, \"as did ye rest of  ye men of warr,\" and they took possession of the island, which was found  to be deserted by its inhabitants. The troops that were on board Durell's  ships were under the command of Colonel Carleton, the  Quartermaster-General of the force, and Wolfe's great friend, whose  services had only been obtained from the king with the greatest  difficulty. Whilst awaiting the arrival of Saunders with the remainder of  the expeditionary force, every endeavour was made to gain knowledge of  the difficulties of the river, and Cook's log notes how the boats were  out \"sounding ye channel of ye Traverse\"; and on the 11th June there is:  \"Returned satisfied with being acquainted with ye Channel.\" The Traverse  here spoken of is that channel running from a high black-looking cape,  known as Cape Torment, across into the south channel, passing between the  east end of the Ile d'Orleans and Ile Madame. It is still looked upon as  one of the worst pieces of the river navigation.    The British had some charts of the river showing the course taken by the  French vessels, for in a note to the orders issued by Saunders on 15th  May to the Masters of Transports, special attention is called to \"a plan  or chart showing the route which His Excellency intends to make from  Louisburg Harbour to the Island of Bic\"; and this chart was most probably  taken from one captured by Boscawen in 1755, and published in September  1759 by T. Kitchen in the London Magazine having the Traverse shown on a  larger scale. The soundings taken at the time Durell was waiting would be  to verify those shown on this chart.    After a short delay in Halifax, Saunders left for Louisburg to gather up  the remainder of the forces and stores, and on his arrival still found  the port hampered by ice; in fact, Major Knox, of the 43rd Regiment,  relates that even so late as 1st June men were able to get ashore from  their ships, stepping from one piece of ice to another. There was also  further cause for dissatisfaction, delay in the arrival of the ships with  soldiers and stores. Some of the troops had been directed to other work  without any intimation to Wolfe, whilst others were in a very bad state  from scurvy and measles; some had lost their entire equipment, and it was  with the greatest difficulty replaced; the supply of money was criminally  small, and yet it is pleasant to read on the authority of Major Knox  that:    \"I had the inexpressible pleasure to observe at Louisburg that our whole  armament, naval and military, were in high spirits; and though, by all  accounts, we shall have a numerous army and a variety of difficulties to  cope with, yet, under such Admirals and Generals, among whom we have the  happiness to behold the most cordial unanimity, together with so  respectable a fleet and a body of well-appointed regular troops, we have  every reason to hope for the greatest success.\"    ORDERS TO TRANSPORTS.    Before leaving, Saunders issued his instructions as to the order of  sailing. He divided the transports into two divisions, the Starboard  flying a red flag, and the Larboard a white one: he assigned to each  vessel its position and duties, and pointed out to each Master of a hired  transport that if the orders of his officers were not promptly and  exactly carried out they would be fired on, adding with a touch of grim  humour that the cost of the powder and shot so expended would be  carefully noted and charged against the hire of the offending ship. On  the 6th June Saunders was off Newfoundland with 22 men-of-war and 119  transports, and the cold winds blowing off the snow-covered hills of that  island were severely felt by the troops. On the 18th, when off the Island  of Bic, they were joined by Wolfe in the Richmond, and five days after  picked up Durell at the Ile aux Coudres. Here Saunders transferred his  flag to the Stirling Castle, which he had selected in England for the  purpose, owing to her handiness (Cook's friend, Mr. Bissett, was still on  board), and leaving Durell with eleven of the deepest draught to guard  against any interference from a French fleet, he proceeded up the river  with the remainder. The work was hard, constantly anchoring and weighing  to take every advantage of wind and tide, and the progress was slow; but  at length the whole of the ships passed the Traverse, and on the 26th the  fleet anchored off St. Laurent, on the Ile d'Orleans, and the troops were  landed on the following day. Thus the much-dreaded passage up the St.  Lawrence had been carried out, and the fact that no loss of any kind had  occurred to either man-of-war or transport, reflects the very greatest  credit on all engaged in the operation. Knox relates how the Master of  the transport he was on, a Brother of Trinity House and Thames pilot,  named Killick, refused the services of a French prisoner as pilot, and  observing, \"Damme, I'll show them an Englishman can go where a Frenchman  dar'n't show his nose,\" took his ship up himself, chaffing the occupants  of the mark boats as he passed, and in the end declared that it was no  worse than the Thames.    The wonderful success of their passage was emphasised the afternoon after  their arrival at St. Laurent when a heavy gale struck the fleet, driving  several ships into collision or ashore, and causing considerable loss in  anchors and cables. As soon as possible the men-of-war boats were out  rendering every assistance, and all the vessels were secured but two,  which were too firmly fixed to be towed off shore, and these were soon  afterwards burnt by the enemy.    FIREWORKS.    Thinking to profit by the disorder which must necessarily have been  caused by the storm, the French made a determined attempt to destroy the  fleet by means of eight fireships which were floated down stream on the  unsuspecting British. Fortunately they were ignited prematurely, and the  boats of the Pembroke and other ships were again out, employed in the  hazardous task of towing these undesired visitors into such places as  would permit them to burn themselves out without danger to the shipping.  Six were quickly got into safety, whilst the other two grounded and burnt  out without causing further inconvenience. Captain Knox describes the  scene as a display of \"the grandest fireworks that can possibly be  conceived.\" The only result was to cause the retirement of a picket at  the western end of the Ile d'Orleans, and the officer in command, who  thought he was about to be attacked in force, was to have been tried by  court-martial, but being advised to throw himself on Wolfe's mercy, was  pardoned for his error of judgment. To guard against a repetition of such  an attack, a system of guard boats, some moored across the river and some  patrolling, was established, entailing considerable extra work on the  sailors.

If for any reason the series of observations had to be interrupted, it  was resumed at the same point subsequently. Occasionally it was found  desirable or necessary to present only five of the series of ten  settings in succession and then to interrupt observations for an  interval of a few minutes or even several hours. But as a rule it was  possible to present the series of ten settings. All things being  considered, it proved more satisfactory to give only ten trials a day to  each subject. Frequently twenty and rarely thirty trials were given on  the same day. In such cases the series of settings was simply repeated.  The only pause between trials was that necessary for resetting the  entrance doors and replenishing the food which served as a reward for  success.        III    RESULTS OF MULTIPLE-CHOICE EXPERIMENTS      1. Skirrl, _Pithecus irus_    _Problem 1. First at the Left End_      Systematic work with the multiple-choice apparatus and method described  in the previous section was undertaken early in April with Skirrl,  Sobke, and Julius. The results for each of them are now to be presented  with such measure of detail as their importance seems to justify.    Skirrl had previously been used by Doctor Hamilton in an experimental  study of reactive tendencies. He proved so remarkably inefficient in the  work that Doctor Hamilton was led to characterize him as feeble-minded,  and to recommend him to me for further study because of his mental  peculiarities. With me he was from the first frank, aggressive, and  inclined to be savage. It was soon possible for me to go into the large  cage, Z, with him and allow him to take food from my hand. He was  without fear of the experimental apparatus and it proved relatively easy  to accustom him to the routine of the experiment. Throughout the work he  was rather slow, inattentive, and erratic.    Beginning on April 7, I sought to acquaint him with the multiple-choice  apparatus by allowing him to make trips through the several boxes, with  the reward of food each time. Thus, for example, with the entrance and  exit doors of box 7 raised, the monkey was allowed to pass into the  reaction-compartment E and thence through box 7 to the food cup. As soon  as he had finished eating, he was called back to D by the experimenter  and, after a few seconds, allowed, similarly, to make a trip by way of  one of the other boxes. By reason of this preliminary training he soon  came to seek eagerly for the reward of food.    On April 10 the apparatus was painted white in order to increase the  lightness and thus render it easier for the experimenter to observe the  animal's movements, and when on April 12 Skirrl was again introduced to  it for further preliminary training, he utterly refused to enter the  boxes, giving every indication of extreme fear of the white floors and  even of the sides of the boxes. Finally, the attempts to induce him to  enter the boxes had to be given up, and he was returned to his cage  unfed. The following day I was equally unsuccessful in either driving or  tempting him with food into the apparatus. But on April 14 he was so  hungry that he was finally lured in by the use of food. He cautiously  approached the boxes and attempted to climb through on the sides instead  of walking on the floor. It was perfectly evident that he had an  instinctive or an acquired fear of the white surfaces. As the matter was  of prime importance for the success of my work, I inquired of Doctor  Hamilton, and of the men in charge of the cages, for any incident which  might account for this peculiar behavior, and I learned that some three  months earlier, while the animal cages were being whitewashed, Skirrl  had jumped at one of the laborers who was applying a brush to the  framework of one of the cages and had shaken some lime into his eyes. He  was greatly frightened and enraged. Evidently he experienced extreme  discomfort, if not acute pain, and there resulted an association with  whiteness which was quite sufficient to cause him to avoid the freshly  painted apparatus.    Having obtained an adequate explanation of this monkey's peculiar  behavior, I proceeded with my efforts to induce him to work smoothly and  rapidly, and on April 15, by covering the floor with sawdust, I so  diminished the influence of the whiteness as to render the preliminary  training fairly satisfactory. At the end of two more days everything was  going so well that it seemed desirable to begin the regular experiment.    On the morning of April 19, Skirrl was introduced to the apparatus and  given his first series of ten trials on problem 1. This problem demanded  the selection of the first door at the left in any group of open doors.  The procedure was as previously described in that the experimenter  raised the entrance doors of a certain group of boxes, admitted the  animal to the reaction-chamber, punished incorrect choices by confining  the animal for thirty seconds, and rewarded correct choices by raising  the exit door and thus permitting escape and the obtaining of food. The  trials were given in rapid succession, and the total time required for  this first series of ten trials was thirty-five minutes. Skirrl worked  faithfully throughout this interval and exhibited no marked  discouragement. When confined in a box he showed uneasiness and  dissatisfaction by moving about constantly, shaking the doors, and  trying to raise them in order to escape.    For the series of settings used in connection with problem 1, the reader  is referred to page 18. In the first setting, the doors numbered 1, 2,  and 3, were opened. As it happened, the animal when admitted to the  reaction-chamber immediately chose box l. Having received the reward of  food, he was called back to D, and doors 8 and 9 having been raised in  preparation for the next trial, he was again admitted to the  reaction-chamber. This time he quickly chose box 9 and was confined  therein for thirty seconds. On being released, he chose after an  interval of four minutes, box 8, thus completing the trial.    As it is highly important, not only in connection with the present  description of behavior, but also for subsequent comparison of the  reactions of different types of organism in this experiment, to present  the detailed records for each trial, tables have been constructed which  offer in brief space the essential data for every trial in connection  with a given problem.    Table 1 contains the results for Skirrl in problem 1. It is constructed  as follows: the date of a series of trials appears in the first vertical  column; the numbers (and number) of the trials for the series or date  appear in column 2; the following ten columns present respectively the  results of the trials for each of the ten settings. Each number, in  these results, designates a box entered. At the extreme right of the  table are three columns which indicate, first, the number of trials in  which the right box was chosen first, column headed R; and second, the  number of trials in which at least one incorrect choice occurred, column  headed W. In the last column, the daily ratio of these first choices  appears.    Taking the first line of table 1 below the explanatory headings, we note  on April 19 ten trials, numbered 1 to 10, were given to Skirrl. In trial  1, with setting 1, he chose correctly the first time, and the record is  therefore simply 1. In trial 2, setting 2, he incorrectly chose box 9,  the first time. At his next opportunity, he chose box 8, which was the  right one. The record therefore reads 9.8. In trial 3, setting 3, he  chose incorrectly twice before finally selecting the right box. The  record reads 6.7.3, and so on throughout the ten trials which constitute  a series. The summary for this series indicates three right and seven  wrong first choices, that is, three cases in which the right box was  entered first. The ratio of right to wrong first choices is therefore 1  to 2.33. Since the total number of doors open in the ten settings is  thirty-five, and since in each of the ten settings one door is  describable as the right door, the probable ratio, apart from the  effects of training, of right to wrong first choices is 1 to 2.50. It is  evident, therefore, that Skirrl in his first series of trials closely  approximated expectation in the number of mistakes.
