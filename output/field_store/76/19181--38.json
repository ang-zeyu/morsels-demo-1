But as he had sped before so he did at  Easter, and the barons yet once more contrived delays till Pentecost.    But now the archbishop, fully seeing God's will, called together, by  Merlin's counsel, a band of knights and gentlemen-at-arms, and set them  about Arthur to keep him safely till the feast of Pentecost. And when at  the feast Arthur still again alone prevailed to move the sword, the people  all with one accord cried out, \"Long live King Arthur! we will have no  more delay, nor any other king, for so it is God's will; and we will slay  whoso resisteth Him and Arthur;\" and wherewithal they kneeled down all at  once, and cried for Arthur's grace and pardon that they had so long  delayed him from his crown. Then he full sweetly and majestically pardoned  them; and taking in his hand the sword, he offered it upon the high altar  of the church.    Anon was he solemnly knighted with great pomp by the most famous knight  there present, and the crown was placed upon his head; and, having taken  oath to all the people, lords and commons, to be true king and deal in  justice only unto his life's end, he received homage and service from all  the barons who held lands and castles from the crown. Then he made Sir  Key, High Steward of England, and Sir Badewaine of Britain, Constable, and  Sir Ulfius, Chamberlain: and after this, with all his court and a great  retinue of knights and armed men, he journeyed into Wales, and was crowned  again in the old city of Caerleon-upon-Usk.    Meanwhile those knights and barons who had so long delayed him from the  crown, met together and went up to the coronation feast at Caerleon, as if  to do him homage; and there they ate and drank such things as were set  before them at the royal banquet, sitting with the others in the great  hall.    But when after the banquet Arthur began, according to the ancient royal  custom, to bestow great boons and fiefs on whom he would, they all with  one accord rose up, and scornfully refused his gifts, crying that they  would take nothing from a beardless boy come of low or unknown birth, but  would instead give him good gifts of hard sword-strokes between neck and  shoulders.    Whereat arose a deadly tumult in the hall, and every man there made him  ready to fight. But Arthur leaped up as a flame of fire against them, and  all his knights and barons drawing their swords, rushed after him upon  them and began a full sore battle; and presently the king's party  prevailed, and drave the rebels from the hall and from the city, closing  the gates behind them; and King Arthur brake his sword upon them in his  eagerness and rage.    But amongst them were six kings of great renown and might, who more than  all raged against Arthur and determined to destroy him, namely, King Lot,  King Nanters, King Urien, King Carados, King Yder, and King Anguisant.  These six, therefore, joining their armies together, laid close siege to  the city of Caerleon, wherefrom King Arthur had so shamefully driven them.    And after fifteen days Merlin came suddenly into their camp and asked them  what this treason meant. Then he declared to them that Arthur was no base  adventurer, but King Uther's son, whom they were bound to serve and honour  even though Heaven had not vouchsafed the wondrous miracle of the sword.  Some of the kings, when they heard Merlin speak thus, marvelled and  believed him; but others, as King Lot, laughed him and his words to scorn,  and mocked him for a conjurer and wizard. But it was agreed with Merlin  that Arthur should come forth and speak with the kings.    So he went forth to them to the city gate, and with him the archbishop and  Merlin, and Sir Key, Sir Brastias, and a great company of others. And he  spared them not in his speech, but spoke to them as king and chieftain  telling them plainly he would make them all bow to him if he lived, unless  they choose to do him homage there and then; and so they parted in great  wrath, and each side armed in haste.    \"What will ye do?\" said Merlin to the kings; \"ye had best hold your hands,  for were ye ten times as many ye should not prevail.\"    \"Shall we be afraid of a dream-reader?\" quoth King Lot in scorn.    With that Merlin vanished away and came to King Arthur.    Then Arthur said to Merlin, \"I have need now of a sword that shall  chastise these rebels terribly.\"    \"Come then with me,\" said Merlin, \"for hard by there is a sword that I can  gain for thee.\"    So they rode out that night till they came to a fair and broad lake, and  in the midst of it King Arthur saw an arm thrust up, clothed in white  samite, and holding a great sword in the hand.    \"Lo! yonder is the sword I spoke of,\" said Merlin.    Then saw they a damsel floating on the lake in the Moonlight. \"What damsel  is that?\" said the king.    \"The lady of the lake,\" said Merlin; \"for upon this lake there is a rock,  and on the rock a noble palace, where she abideth, and she will come  towards thee presently, thou shalt ask her courteously for the sword.\"    [Illustration: The lady of the lake.]    Therewith the damsel came to King Arthur, and saluted him, and he saluted  her, and said, \"Lady, what sword is that the arm holdeth above the water?  I would that it were mine, for I have no sword.\"    \"Sir King,\" said the lady of the lake, \"that sword is mine, and if thou  wilt give me in return a gift whenever I shall ask it of thee, thou shalt  have it.\"    \"By my faith,\" said he, \"I will give thee any gift that thou shalt ask.\"    \"Well,\" said the damsel, \"go into yonder barge, and row thyself unto the  sword, and take it and the scabbard with thee, and I will ask my gift of  thee when I see my time.\"    So King Arthur and Merlin alighted, and tied their horses to two trees,  and went into the barge; and when they came to the sword that the hand  held, King Arthur took it by the handle and bore it with him, and the arm  and hand went down under the water; and so they came back to land, and  rode again to Caerleon.    On the morrow Merlin bade King Arthur to set fiercely on the enemy; and in  the meanwhile three hundred good knights went over to King Arthur from the  rebels' side. Then at the spring of day, when they had scarce left their  tents, he fell on them with might and main, and Sir Badewaine, Sir Key,  and Sir Brastias slew on the right hand and on the left marvellously; and  ever in the thickest of the fight King Arthur raged like a young lion, and  laid on with his sword, and did wondrous deeds of arms, to the joy and  admiration of the knights and barons who beheld him.    Then King Lot, King Carados, and the King of the Hundred Knights--who also  rode with them--going round to the rear, set on King Arthur fiercely from  behind; but Arthur, turning to his knights, fought ever in the foremost  press until his horse was slain beneath him. At that, King Lot rode  furiously at him, and smote him down; but rising straightway, and being  set again on horseback, he drew his sword Excalibur that he had gained by  Merlin from the lady of the lake, which, shining brightly as the light of  thirty torches, dazzled the eyes of his enemies. And therewith falling on  them afresh with all his knights, he drove them back and slew them in  great numbers, and Merlin by his arts scattered among them fire and pitchy  smoke, so that they broke and fled. Then all the common people of  Caerleon, seeing them give way, rose up with one accord, and rushed at  them with clubs and staves, and chased them far and wide, and slew many  great knights and lords, and the remainder of them fled and were seen no  more. Thus won King Arthur his first battle and put his enemies to shame.    But the six kings, though sorely routed, prepared for a new war, and  joining to themselves five others swore together that, whether for weal or  woe, they would keep steadfast alliance till they had destroyed King  Arthur. Then, with a host of 50,000 men-at-arms on horseback, and 10,000  foot, they were soon ready, and sent forth their fore-riders, and drew  from the northern country towards King Arthur, to the castle of Bedgraine.    But he by Merlin's counsel had sent over sea to King Ban of Benwick and  King Bors of Gaul, praying them to come and help him in his wars, and  promising to help in return against King Claudas, their foe. To which  those kings made answer that they would joyfully fulfil his wish, and  shortly after came to London with 300 knights, well arrayed for both peace  and war, leaving behind them a great army on the other side of the sea  till they had consulted with King Arthur and his ministers how they might  best dispose of it.    And Merlin being asked for his advice and help, agreed to go himself and  fetch it over sea to England, which in one night he did; and brought with  him 10,000 horsemen and led them northward privately to the forest of  Bedgraine, and there lodged them in a valley secretly.    Then, by the counsel of Merlin, when they knew which way the eleven kings  would ride and sleep, King Arthur with Kings Ban and Bors made themselves  ready with their army for the fight, having yet but 30,000 men, counting  the 10,000 who had come from Gaul.    \"Now shall ye do my advice,\" said Merlin; \"I would that King Ban and King  Bors, with all their fellowship of 10,000 men, were led to ambush in this  wood ere daylight, and stir not therefrom until the battle hath been long  waged. And thou, Lord Arthur, at the spring of day draw forth thine army  before the enemy, and dress the battle so that they may at once see all  thy host, for they will be the more rash and hardy when they see you have  but 20,000 men.\"    To this the three knights and the barons heartily consented, and it was  done as Merlin had devised. So on the morrow when the hosts beheld each  other, the host of the north was greatly cheered to find so few led out  against them.    Then gave King Arthur the command to Sir Ulfius and Sir"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12758"],[0,"Library of the World's Best Mystery and Detective Stories (#5)"],[1,"could hide.\"    But just then, the policeman said that he had tried to get into the  sexton's hut through the door or the window, and that at last he had  succeeded in doing so by breaking open a square in a window, which had  been mended with paper, and that he had opened it and obtained  posesssion of the key which he brought to the police director.    His plans were very quickly settled. He had the chapel opened and went  in with the young Latitudinarian; then he told the police sergeant to  lock the door behind him and to put the key back where he had found it,  and to shut the window of the sexton's cottage carefully. Lastly, he  made arrangements as to what they were to do in case anything  unforeseen should occur, whereupon the sergeant and the constable left  the churchyard, and lay down in a ditch at some distance from the gate,  but opposite to it.    Almost as soon as the clock struck half-past eleven, they heard steps  near the chapel, whereupon the police director and the young  Latitudinarian went to the window, in order to watch the beginning of  the exorcism, and as the chapel was in total darkness, they thought  that they should be able to see, without being seen; but matters turned  out differently from what they expected.    Suddenly, the key turned in the lock, and they barely had time to  conceal themselves behind the altar before two men came in, one of whom  was carrying a dark lantern. One was the young man's father, an elderly  man of the middle class, who seemed very unhappy and depressed, the  other the Jesuit father K----, a tall, thin, big-boned man, with a  thin, bilious face, in which two large gray eyes shone restlessly under  their bushy black eyebrows. He lit the tapers, which were standing on  the altar, and then began to say a _Requiem Mass_; while the old man  knelt on the altar steps and served him.    When it was over, the Jesuit took the book of the Gospels and the  holy-water sprinkler, and went slowly out of the chapel, while the old  man followed him, with a holy-water basin in one hand and a taper in  the other. Then the police director left his hiding place, and stooping  down, so as not to be seen, he crept to the chapel window, where he  cowered down carefully, and the young man followed his example. They  were now looking straight on his mother's grave.    The Jesuit, followed by the superstitious old man, walked three times  round the grave, then he remained standing before it, and by the light  of the taper he read a few passages from the Gospel; then he dipped the  holy-water sprinkler three times into the holy-water basin, and  sprinkled the grave three times; then both returned to the chapel,  knelt down outside it with their faces toward the grave, and began to  pray aloud, until at last the Jesuit sprang up, in a species of wild  ecstasy, and cried out three times in a shrill voice:    _\"Exsurge! Exsurge! Exsurge!\"_[1]      [1] Arise!    Scarcely had the last word of the exorcism died away when thick, blue  smoke rose out of the grave, which rapidly grew into a cloud, and began  to assume the outlines of a human body, until at last a tall, white  figure stood behind the grave, and beckoned with its hand.    \"Who art thou?\" the Jesuit asked solemnly, while the old man began to  cry.    \"When I was alive, I was called Anna Maria B----,\" the ghost replied in  a hollow voice.    \"Will you answer all my questions?\" the priest continued.    \"As far as I can.\"    \"Have you not yet been delivered from purgatory by our prayers, and all  the Masses for your soul, which we have said for you?\"    \"Not yet, but soon, soon I shall be.\"    \"When?\"    \"As soon as that blasphemer, my son, has been punished.\"    \"Has that not already happened? Has not your husband disinherited his  lost son, and made the Church his heir, in his place?\"    \"That is not enough.\"    \"What must he do besides?\"    \"He must deposit his will with the Judicial Authorities as his last  will and testament, and drive the reprobate out of his house.\"    \"Consider well what you are saying; must this really be?\"    \"It must, or otherwise I shall have to languish in purgatory much  longer,\" the sepulchral voice replied with a deep sigh; but the next  moment it yelled out in terror:--    \"Oh! Good Lord!\" and the ghost began to run away as fast as it could. A  shrill whistle was heard, and then another, and the police director  laid his hand on the shoulder of the exorciser accompanied with the  remark:--    \"You are in custody.\"    Meanwhile, the police sergeant and the policeman, who had come into the  churchyard, had caught the ghost, and dragged it forward. It was the  sexton, who had put on a flowing, white dress, and who wore a wax mask,  which bore striking resemblance to his mother, as the son declared.    When the case was heard, it was proved that the mask had been very  skillfully made from a portrait of the deceased woman. The Government  gave orders that the matter should be investigated as secretly as  possible, and left the punishment of Father K---- to the spiritual  authorities, which was a matter of course, at a time when priests were  outside the jurisdiction of the Civil Authorities; and it is needless  to say that he was very comfortable during his imprisonment, in a  monastery in a part of the country which abounded with game and trout.    The only valuable result of the amusing ghost story was that it brought  about a reconciliation between father and son, and the former, as a  matter of fact, felt such deep respect for priests and their ghosts in  consequence of the apparition that a short time after his wife had left  purgatory for the last time in order to talk with him--he turned  _Protestant_.        _Fear_      We went up on deck after dinner. Before us the Mediterranean lay  without a ripple and shimmering in the moonlight. The great ship glided  on, casting upward to the star-studded sky a long serpent of black  smoke. Behind us the dazzling white water, stirred by the rapid  progress of the heavy bark and beaten by the propeller, foamed, seemed  to writhe, gave off so much brilliancy that one could have called it  boiling moonlight.    There were six or eight of us silent with admiration and gazing toward  far-away Africa whither we were going. The commandant, who was smoking  a cigar with us, brusquely resumed the conversation begun at dinner.    \"Yes, I was afraid then. My ship remained for six hours on that rock,  beaten by the wind and with a great hole in the side. Luckily we were  picked up toward evening by an English coaler which sighted us.\"    Then a tall man of sunburned face and grave demeanor, one of those men  who have evidently traveled unknown and far-away lands, whose calm eye  seems to preserve in its depths something of the foreign scenes it has  observed, a man that you are sure is impregnated with courage, spoke  for the first time.    \"You say, commandant, that you were afraid. I beg to disagree with you.  You are in error as to the meaning of the word and the nature of the  sensation that you experienced. An energetic man is never afraid in the  presence of urgent danger. He is excited, aroused, full of anxiety, but  fear is something quite different.\"    The commandant laughed and answered: \"Bah! I assure you that I was  afraid.\"    Then the man of the tanned countenance addressed us deliberately as  follows:    \"Permit me to explain. Fear--and the boldest men may feel fear--is  something horrible, an atrocious sensation, a sort of decomposition of  the soul, a terrible spasm of brain and heart, the very memory of which  brings a shudder of anguish, but when one is brave he feels it neither  under fire nor in the presence of sure death nor in the face of any  well-known danger. It springs up under certain abnormal conditions,  under certain mysterious influences in the presence of vague peril.  Real fear is a sort of reminiscence of fantastic terror of the past. A  man who believes in ghosts and imagines he sees a specter in the  darkness must feel fear in all its horror.    \"As for me I was overwhelmed with fear in broad daylight about ten  years ago and again one December night last winter.    \"Nevertheless, I have gone through many dangers, many adventures which  seemed to promise death. I have often been in battle. I have been left  for dead by thieves. In America I was condemned as an insurgent to be  hanged, and off the coast of China have been thrown into the sea from  the deck of a ship. Each time I thought I was lost I at once decided  upon my course of action without regret or weakness.    \"That is not fear.    \"I have felt it in Africa, and yet it is a child of the north. The  sunlight banishes it like the mist. Consider this fact, gentlemen.  Among the Orientals life has no value; resignation is natural. The  nights are clear and empty of the somber spirit of unrest which haunts  the brain in cooler lands. In the Orient panic is known, but not fear.    \"Well, then! Here is the incident that befell me in Africa.    \"I was crossing the great sands to the south of Onargla. It is one of  the most curious districts in the world. You have seen the solid  continuous sand of the endless ocean strands. Well, imagine the ocean  itself turned to sand in the midst of a storm. Imagine a silent tempest  with motionless billows of yellow dust. They are high as mountains,  these uneven, varied surges, rising exactly like unchained billows, but  still larger, and stratified like watered silk. On this wild, silent,  and motionless sea, the consuming rays of the tropical sun are poured  pitilessly and directly. You have to climb these streaks of red-hot  ash, descend again on the other side, climb again, climb, climb without  halt, without repose, without shade. The horses cough, sink to their  knees and slide down the sides of these remarkable hills.    \"We were a couple of friends followed by eight spahis and four camels  with their drivers. We were no "]]]
