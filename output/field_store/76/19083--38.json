How full of the touching yet  undegrading commiseration which adversity has a right to take upon  itself, when accompanied with the consciousness of manly endeavour and a  good motive! How could such a man condescend at other times to rage with  abuse, and to delight himself in images of infernal torment!    The dates of these fluctuations of feeling towards his native city are  not known; but it is supposed to have been not very long before his  abode with Can Grande that he received permission to return to Florence,  on conditions which he justly refused and resented in the following  noble letter to a kinsman. The old spelling of the original (in the  note) is retained as given by Foscolo in the article on \"Dante\" in the  _Edinburgh Review_ (vol. XXX. no. 60); and I have retained also, with  little difference, the translation which accompanies it:    \"From your letter, which I received with due respect and affection, I  observe how much you have at heart my restoration to my country. I am  bound to you the more gratefully, inasmuch as an exile rarely finds a  friend. But after mature consideration, I must, by my answer, disappoint  the wishes of some little minds; and I confide in the judgment to which  your impartiality and prudence will lead you. Your nephew and mine has  written to me, what indeed had been mentioned by many other friends,  that, by a decree concerning the exiles, I am allowed to return to  Florence, provided I pay a certain sum of money, and submit to the  humiliation of asking and receiving absolution: wherein, my father, I  see two propositions that are ridiculous and impertinent. I speak of the  impertinence of those who mention such conditions to me; for in your  letter, dictated by judgment and discretion, there is no such thing. Is  such an invitation, then, to return to his country glorious to d. all.  (Dante Allighieri), after suffering in exile almost fifteen years? Is it  thus they would recompense innocence which all the world knows, and  the labour and fatigue of unremitting study? Far from the man who is  familiar with philosophy be the senseless baseness of a heart of earth,  that could act like a little sciolist, and imitate the infamy of some  others, by offering himself up as it were in chains: far from the man  who cries aloud for justice, this compromise by his money with his  persecutors. No, my father, this is not the way that shall lead me back  to my country. I will return with hasty steps, if you or any other can  open to me a way that shall not derogate from the fame and honour of d.  (Dante); but if by no such way Florence can be entered, then Florence I  shall never enter. What! shall I not everywhere enjoy the light of the  sun and stars? and may I not seek and contemplate, in every corner of  the earth, under the canopy of heaven, consoling and delightful truth,  without first rendering myself inglorious, nay infamous, to the people  and republic of Florence? Bread, I hope, will not fail me.\" [15]    Had Dante's pride and indignation always vented themselves in this truly  exalted manner, never could the admirers of his genius have refused him  their sympathy; and never, I conceive, need he either have brought his  exile upon him, or closed it as he did. To that close we have now come,  and it is truly melancholy and mortifying. Failure in a negotiation with  the Venetians for his patron, Guido Novello, is supposed to have been  the last bitter drop which made the cup of his endurance run over. He  returned from Venice to Ravenna, worn out, and there died, after fifteen  years' absence from his country, in the year 1231, aged fifty-seven. His  life had been so agitated, that it probably would not have lasted so  long, but for the solace of his poetry, and the glory which he knew it  must produce him. Guido gave him a sumptuous funeral, and intended to  give him a monument; but such was the state of Italy in those times,  that he himself died in exile the year after. The monument, however, and  one of a noble sort, was subsequently bestowed by the father of Cardinal  Bembo, in 1483; and another, still nobler, as late as 1780, by Cardinal  Gonzaga. His countrymen, in after years, made two solemn applications  for the removal of his dust to Florence; but the just pride of the  Ravennese refused them.    Of the exile's family, three sons died young; the daughter went into a  nunnery; and the two remaining brothers, who ultimately joined their  father in his banishment, became respectable men of letters, and left  families in Ravenna; where the race, though extinct in the male line,  still survives through a daughter, in the noble house of Serego  Alighieri. No direct descent of the other kind from poets of former  times is, I believe, known to exist.    The manners and general appearance of Dante have been minutely recorded,  and are in striking agreement with his character. Boccaccio and other  novelists are the chief relaters; and their accounts will be received  accordingly with the greater or less trust, as the reader considers them  probable; but the author of the Decameron personally knew some of his  friends and relations, and he intermingles his least favourable reports  with expressions of undoubted reverence. The poet was of middle height,  of slow and serious deportment, had a long dark visage, large piercing  eyes, large jaws, an aquiline nose, a projecting under-lip, and thick  curling hair--an aspect announcing determination and melancholy. There  is a sketch of his countenance, in his younger days, from the immature  but sweet pencil of Giotto; and it is a refreshment to look at it,  though pride and discontent, I think, are discernible in its lineaments.  It is idle, and no true compliment to his nature, to pretend, as his  mere worshippers do, that his face owes all its subsequent gloom and  exacerbation to external causes, and that he was in every respect the  poor victim of events--the infant changed at nurse by the wicked. What  came out of him, he must have had in him, at least in the germ; and so  inconsistent was his nature altogether, or, at any rate, such an epitome  of all the graver passions that are capable of co-existing, both sweet  and bitter, thoughtful and outrageous, that one is sometimes tempted to  think he must have had an angel for one parent, and--I shall leave his  own toleration to say what--for the other.    To continue the account of his manners and inclinations: He dressed with  a becoming gravity; was temperate in his diet; a great student; seldom  spoke, unless spoken to, but always to the purpose; and almost all the  anecdotes recorded of him, except by himself, are full of pride and  sarcasm. He was so swarthy, that a woman, as he was going by a door in  Verona, is said to have pointed him out to another, with a remark  which made the saturnine poet smile--\"That is the man who goes to hell  whenever he pleases, and brings back news of the people there.\" On which  her companion observed--\"Very likely; don't you see what a curly beard he  has, and what a dark face? owing, I dare say, to the heat and smoke.\" He  was evidently a passionate lover of painting and music--is thought to  have been less strict in his conduct with regard to the sex than might  be supposed from his platonical aspirations--(Boccaccio says, that even  a goitre did not repel him from the pretty face of a mountaineer)--could  be very social when he was young, as may be gathered from the sonnet  addressed to his friend Cavalcante about a party for a boat--and though  his poetry was so intense and weighty, the laudable minuteness of a  biographer has informed us, that his hand-writing, besides being neat  and precise, was of a long and particularly thin character: \"meagre\" is  his word.    There is a letter, said to be nearly coeval with his time, and to be  written by the prior of a monastery to a celebrated Ghibelline leader, a  friend of Dante's, which, though hitherto accounted apocryphal by most,  has such an air of truth, and contains an image of the poet in his exile  so exceedingly like what we conceive of the man, that it is difficult  not to believe it genuine, especially as the handwriting has lately been  discovered to be that of Boccaccio.[16] At all events, I am sure the  reader will not be sorry to have the substance of it. The writer says,  that he perceived one day a man coming into the monastery, whom none of  its inmates knew. He asked him what he wanted; but the stranger saying  nothing, and continuing to gaze on the building as though contemplating  its architecture, the question was put a second time; upon which,  looking round on his interrogators, he answered, \"_Peace_!\" The prior,  whose curiosity was strongly excited, took the stranger apart, and  discovering who he was, shewed him all the attention becoming his fame;  and then Dante took a little book out of his bosom, aid observing that  perhaps the prior had not seen it, expressed a wish to leave it with his  new friend as a memorial. It was \"a portion,\" he said, \"of his work.\"  The prior received the volume with respect; and politely opening it at  once, and fixing his eyes on the contents, in order, it would seem,  to shew the interest he took in it, appeared suddenly to check some  observation which they suggested. Dante found that his reader was  surprised at seeing the work written in the vulgar tongue instead of  Latin. He explained, that he wished to address himself to readers of all  classes; and concluded with requesting the prior to add some notes, with  the spirit of which he furnished him, and then forward it (transcribed,  I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10886"],[0,"The Untamed (#5)"],[1,", but it's about an even draw. Take your pick.\"    \"Not me,\" said Haines, \"if you had ten chances instead of one I might  stack some coin on you. If the dollar were stationary I know you could  do it, but a moving coin looks pretty small.\"    \"Here you are,\" called Morgan, who stood at a distance of twenty  paces, \"are you ready?\"    Silent whipped out his revolver and poised it. \"Let 'er go!\"    The coin whirled in the air. Silent fired as it commenced to fall--it  landed untouched.    \"As a kind, Christian soul,\" said Morgan sarcastically, \"I ain't in  your class, stranger. Charity always sort of interests me when I'm on  the receivin' end!\"    The crowd chuckled, and the sound infuriated Silent.    \"Don't go back jest yet, partners,\" he drawled. \"Mister Morgan, I got  one hundred bones which holler that I can plug that dollar the second  try.\"    \"Boys,\" grinned Morgan, \"I'm leavin' you to witness that I hate to do  it, but business is business. Here you are!\"    The coin whirled again. Silent, with his lips pressed into a straight  line and his brows drawn dark over his eyes, waited until the coin  reached the height of its rise, and then fired--missed--fired again,  and sent the coin spinning through the air in a flashing semicircle.  It was a beautiful piece of gun-play. In the midst of the clamour of  applause Silent strode towards Morgan with his hand outstretched.    \"After all,\" he said. \"I knowed you wasn't really hard of heart. It  only needed a little time and persuasion to make you dig for coin when  I pass the box.\"    Morgan, red of face and scowling, handed over his late winnings and  his own stakes.    \"It took you two shots to do it,\" he said, \"an' if I wanted to argue  the pint maybe you wouldn't walk off with the coin.\"    \"Partner,\" said Jim Silent gently, \"I got a wanderin' hunch that  you're showin' a pile of brains by not arguin' this here pint!\"    There followed that little hush of expectancy which precedes trouble,  but Morgan, after a glance at the set lips of his opponent, swallowed  his wrath.    \"I s'pose you'll tell how you did this to your kids when  you're eighty,\" he said scornfully, \"but around here, stranger, they  don't think much of it. Whistlin' Dan\"--he paused, as if to calculate  how far he could safely exaggerate--\"Whistlin' Dan can stand with  his back to the coins an' when they're thrown he drills four dollars  easier than you did one--an' he wouldn't waste three shots on one  dollar. He ain't so extravagant!\"          CHAPTER IV      SOMETHING YELLOW    The crowd laughed again at the excitement of Morgan, and Silent's  mirth particularly was loud and long.    \"An' if you're still bent on charity,\" he said at last, \"maybe we  could find somethin' else to lay a bet on!\"    \"Anything you name!\" said Morgan hotly.    \"I suppose,\" said Silent, \"that you're some rider, eh?\"    \"I c'n get by with most of 'em.\"    \"Yeh--I suppose you never pulled leather in your life?\"    \"Not any hoss that another man could ride straight up.\"    \"Is that so? Well, partner, you see that roan over there?\"    \"That tall horse?\"    \"You got him. You c'n win back that hundred if you stick on his back  two minutes. D'you take it?\"    Morgan hesitated a moment. The big roan was footing it nervously here  and there, sometimes throwing up his head suddenly after the manner of  a horse of bad temper. However, the loss of that hundred dollars and  the humiliation which accompanied it, weighed heavily on the saloon  owner's mind.    \"I'll take you,\" he said.    A high, thrilling whistle came faintly from the distance.    \"That fellow on the black horse down the road,\" said Lee Haines, \"I  guess he's the one that can hit the four dollars? Ha! ha! ha!\"    \"Sure,\" grinned Silent, \"listen to his whistle! We'll see if we can  drag another bet out of the bar-keep if the roan doesn't hurt him too  bad. Look at him now!\"    Morgan was having a bad time getting his foot in the stirrup, for  the roan reared and plunged. Finally two men held his head and the  saloon-keeper swung into the saddle. There was a little silence. The  roan, as if doubtful that he could really have this new burden on his  back, and still fearful of the rope which had been lately tethering  him, went a few short, prancing steps, and then, feeling something  akin to freedom, reared straight up, snorting. The crowd yelled with  delight, and the sound sent the roan back to all fours and racing down  the road. He stopped with braced feet, and Morgan lurched forwards on  the neck, yet he struck to his seat gamely. Whistling Dan was not a  hundred yards away.    Morgan yelled and swung the quirt. The response of the roan was  another race down the road at terrific speed, despite the pull of  Morgan on the reins. Just as the running horse reached Whistling Dan,  he stopped as short as he had done before, but this time with an added  buck and a sidewise lurch all combined, which gave the effect of  snapping a whip--and poor Morgan was hurled from the saddle like  a stone from a sling. The crowd waved their hats and yelled with  delight.    \"Look out!\" yelled Jim Silent. \"Grab the reins!\"    But though Morgan made a valiant effort the roan easily swerved past  him and went racing down the road.    \"My God,\" groaned Silent, \"he's gone!\"    \"Saddles!\" called someone. \"We'll catch him!\"    \"Catch hell!\" answered Silent bitterly. \"There ain't a hoss on earth  that can catch him--an' now that he ain't got the weight of a rider,  he'll run away from the wind!\"    \"Anyway there goes Dan on Satan after him!\"    \"No use! The roan ain't carryin' a thing but the saddle.\"    \"Satan never seen the day he could make the roan eat dust, anyway!\"    \"Look at 'em go, boys!\"    \"There ain't no use,\" said Jim Silent sadly, \"he'll wind his black for  nothin'--an' I've lost the best hoss on the ranges.\"    \"I believe him,\" whispered one man to a neighbour, \"because I've got  an idea that hoss is Red Peter himself!\"    His companion stared at him agape.    \"Red Pete!\" he said. \"Why, pal, that's the hoss that Silent--\"    \"Maybe it is an' maybe it ain't. But why should we ask too many  questions?\"    \"Let the marshals tend to him. He ain't ever troubled this part of the  range.\"    \"Anyway, I'm goin' to remember his face. If it's really Jim Silent, I  got something that's worth tellin' to my kids when they grow up.\"    They both turned and looked at the tall man with an uncomfortable awe.  The rest of the crowd swarmed into the road to watch the race.    The black stallion was handicapped many yards at the start before Dan  could swing him around after the roan darted past with poor Morgan in  ludicrous pursuit. Moreover, the roan had the inestimable advantage  of an empty saddle. Yet Satan leaned to his work with a stout heart.  There was no rock and pitch to his gait, no jerk and labour to his  strides. Those smooth shoulders were corded now with a thousand lines  where the steel muscles whipped to and fro. His neck stretched out  a little--his ears laid back along the neck--his whole body settled  gradually and continually down as his stride lengthened. Whistling Dan  was leaning forward so that his body would break less wind. He laughed  low and soft as the air whirred into his face, and now and then he  spoke to his horse, no yell of encouragement, but a sound hardly  louder than a whisper. There was no longer a horse and rider--the two  had become one creature--a centaur--the body of a horse and the mind  of a man.    For a time the roan increased his advantage, but quickly Satan began  to hold him even, and then gain. First inch by inch; then at every  stride the distance between them diminished. No easy task. The great  roan had muscle, heart, and that empty saddle; as well, perhaps, as a  thought of the free ranges which lay before him and liberty from the  accursed thraldom of the bit and reins and galling spurs. What he  lacked was that small whispering voice--that hand touching lightly now  and then on his neck--that thrill of generous sympathy which passes  between horse and rider. He lost ground steadily and more and more  rapidly. Now the outstretched black head was at his tail, now at his  flank, now at his girth, now at his shoulder, now they raced nose and  nose. Whistling Dan shifted in the saddle. His left foot took the  opposite stirrup. His right leg swung free.    The big roan swerved--the black in response to a word from his rider  followed the motion--and then the miracle happened. A shadow plunged  through the air; a weight thudded on the saddle of the roan; an iron  hand jerked back the reins.    Red Pete hated men and feared them, but this new weight on his back  was different. It was not the pressure on the reins which urged him to  slow up; he had the bit in his teeth and no human hand could pull down  his head; but into the blind love, blind terror, blind rage which  makes up the consciousness of a horse entered a force which he had  never known before. He realized suddenly that it was folly to attempt  to throw off this clinging burden. He might as well try to jump out of  his skin. His racing stride shortened to a halting gallop, this to a  sharp trot, and in a moment more he was turned and headed back for  Morgan's place. The black, who had followed, turned at the same time  like a dog and followed with jouncing bridle reins. Black Bart, with  lolling red tongue, ran under his head, looking up to the stallion now  and again with a comical air of proprietorship, as if he were showing  the way.    It was very strange to Red Pete. He pranced sideways a little and  shook his head up and down in an effort to regain his former temper,  but that iron hand kept his nose down, now, and that quiet voice  sounded above him--no cursing, no raking of sharp spurs to torture his  tender flanks, no whir of the quirt, but a calm voice of authority and  understanding. Red Pete broke into an easy canter and in this fashion  they came up to Morgan in"]]]
