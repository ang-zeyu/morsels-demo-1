[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11385"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 446, July 19, 1884 (#5)"],[1,"than the mill.\"    A 40-foot mill, erected at Fowler, Indiana, in 1881, is running the  following machinery:    \"I have a universal wood worker, four side, one 34-inch planer, jig saw,  and lathe, also a No. 4 American grinder, and with a good, fair wind I  can run all the machines at one time. I can work about four days and  nights each week. It is easy to control in high winds.\"    A 60-foot diameter mill of similar pattern was erected in Steel County,  Minnesota, in 1867. The owner gives the following history of this mill:    \"I have run this wind flouring mill since 1867 with excellent success.  It runs 3 sets of burrs, one 4 feet, one 31/2 feet, and one 33 inches.  Also 2 smutters, 2 bolts, and all the necessary machinery to make the  mill complete. A 15-mile wind runs everything in good shape. One wind  wheel was broken by a tornado in 1870, and another in 1881 from same  cause. Aside from these two, which cost $250 each, and a month's lost  time, the power did not cost over $10 a year for repairs. In July, 1833,  a cyclone passed over this section, wrecking my will as well as  everything else in its track, and having (out of the profits of the wind  mill) purchased a large water and steam flouring mill here, I last fall  moved the wind mill out to Dakota, where I have it running in  first-class shape and doing a good business. The few tornado wrecks make  me think none the less of wind mills, as my water power has cost me four  times as much in 6 years as the wind power has in 16 years.\"    There are very few of these large mills in use in this country, but  there are a great many from 14 to 30 feet in diameter in use, and their  numbers are rapidly increasing as their merits become known. The field  for the use of wind mills is almost unlimited, and embraces pumping  water, drainage, irrigation, elevating, grinding, shelling, and cleaning  grain, ginning cotton, sawing wood, churning, running stamp mills, and  charging electrical accumulators. This last may be the solution of the  St. Louis gas question.    In the writer's opinion the settlement of the great tableland lying  between the Mississippi Valley and the Rocky Mountains, and extending  from the Gulf of Mexico to the Red River of the North, would be greatly  retarded, if not entirely impracticable, in large sections where no  water is found at less than 100 to 500 feet below the surface, if it  were not for the American wind mill; large cattle ranges without any  surface water have been made available by the use of wind mills. Water  pumped out of the ground remains about the same temperature during the  year, and is much better for cattle than surface water. It yet remains  in the future to determine what the wind mill will not do with the  improvements that are being made from to time.           *       *       *       *       *          THE PNEUMATIC DYNAMITE GUN.      It is here shown as mounted on a torpedo launch and ready for action.  The shell or projectile is fired by compressed air, admitted from an air  reservoir underneath by a simple pressure of the gunner's finger over  the valve. The air passes up through the center of the base, the pipe  connecting with one of the hollow trunnions. The valve is a continuation  of the breech of the gun. The smaller cuts illustrate Lieutenant  Zalinski's plan for mounting the gun on each side of the launch, by  which plan the gun after being charged may have the breech containing  the dynamite depressed, and protected from shots of the enemy by its  complete immersion alongside the launch; and, if necessary, may be  discharged from this protected position. The gun is a seamless brass  tube of about forty feet in length, manipulated by the artillerist in  the manner of an ordinary cannon. Its noiseless discharge sends the  missile with great force, conveying the powerful explosive within it,  which is itself discharged internally upon contact with the deck of a  vessel or other object upon which it strikes, through the explosion of a  percussion fuse in the point of the projectile. A great degree of  accuracy has been obtained by the peculiar form of the projectile.    [Illustration: PNEUMATIC DYNAMITE GUN TORPEDO VESSEL.]    The projectile consists of a thin metal tube, into which the charge is  inserted, and a wooden sabot which closes it at the rear and flares out  until its diameter equals that of the bore of the gun. The forward end  of the tube is pointed with some soft material, in which is embedded the  firing pin, a conical cap closing the end. A cushion of air is  interposed at the rear end of the dynamite charge, to lessen the shock  of the discharge and prevent explosion, until the impact of the  projectile forces the firing pin in upon the dynamite and explodes it.  Many charges have been successfully fired at Fort Hamilton, N.Y. As the  center of gravity is forward of the center of figure in the projectile,  a side wind acting upon the lighter rear part would tend to turn the  head into the wind and thus keep it in the line of its trajectory. A  range of 11/4 miles has been attained with the two inch gun, with a  pressure of 420 lb. to the square inch, and one of three miles is hoped  for with the larger gun and a pressure of 2,000 lb.           *       *       *       *       *          ROPE PULLEY FRICTION BRAKE.      A novel device in connection with rope pulley blocks is illustrated in  the annexed engravings, the object of the appliance being to render it  possible to leave a weight suspended from a block without making the  tail of the rope fast to some neighboring object. By this arrangement  the danger of the rope slipping loose is avoided, and absolute security  is attained, without the necessity of lowering the weight to the ground.  The device itself is a friction brake, constructed in the form of a clip  with holes in it for the three ropes to pass through. It is made to span  the block, and is secured partly by the pin or bolt upon which the  sheaves run, and partly by the bottom bolt, which unites the cheeks of  the block. Thus the brake is readily attachable to existing blocks. The  inner half of the clip or brake is fixed solidly to the block, while the  outer half is carried by two screws, geared together by spur-wheels, and  so cut that although rotating in opposite directions, their movements  are equal and similar. One of the screws carries a light rope-wheel, by  which it can be rotated, the motion being communicated to the second  screw by the toothed wheels. When the wheel is rotated in the right  direction the loose half of the clip is forced toward the other half,  and grips the ropes passing between the two so powerfully that any  weight the blocks are capable of lifting is instantly made secure, and  is held until the brake is released.    A light spiral spring is placed on each of the screws, in order to free  the brake from the rope the moment the pressure is released. The hand  rope has a turn and a half round the pulley, and this obviates the need  of holding both ends of it, and thus leaves one hand free to guide the  descending weight, or to hold the rope of the pulley blocks.  _Engineering_ says these brakes are very useful in raising heavy  weights, as the lift can be secured at each pull, allowing the men to  move hands for another pull, and as they are made very light they do not  cause any inconvenience in moving or carrying the blocks about.

We have from time to time given accounts in this journal of the system  of towage by hauling on a submerged wire rope, first experimented upon  by Baron O. De Mesnil and Mr. Max Eyth. On the river Rhine the system  has been for many years in successful operation; it has also been used  for several years on the Erie Canal in this State. We publish from  _Engineering_ a view of one of the wire rope tug boats of the latest  pattern adopted for use on the Rhine.    The Cologne Central Towing Company (Central Actien-Gesellschaft fuer  Tauerei und Schleppschifffahrt), by whom the wire rope towage on the  Rhine is now carried on, was formed in 1876, by an amalgamation of the  Ruehrorter und Mulheimer Dampfschleppshifffahrt Gesellschaft and the  Central Actien-Gesellschaft fur Tauerei, and in 1877 it owned eight wire  rope tugs (which it still owns) and seventeen paddle tugs. The company  so arranges its work that the wire rope tugs do the haulage up the rapid  portion of the Rhine, from Bonn to Bingen, while the paddle tugs are  employed on the quieter portion of the river extending from Rotterdam to  Bonn, and from Bingen to Mannheim.    [Illustration: ROPE PULLEY FRICTION BRAKE.]    The leading dimensions of the eight wire rope tugs now worked by the  company are as follows:                                 Tugs No. I. to     Tugs No. V. to                                    IV.

They are also provided with water ballast tanks, and  under ordinary circumstances they have a draught of 1.3 to 1.4 meters (4  feet 3 inches to 4 feet 7 inches), this draught being necessary to give  proper immersion to the screws. When the water in the Rhine is very low,  however, the water ballast is pumped out and the tugs are then run with  a draught of 1 meter (3"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11387"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

They would likewise now first place the body in a position  due east and west, and thus bestow an unequivocal mark of distinction  between the funeral deposit of the earliest Roman inhabitants of this  island, and their Christian successors. The usual places of interment  were in fields or gardens,[4] near the highway, to be conspicuous, and  to remind the passengers how transient everything is, that wears the  garb of mortality. By this means, also, they saved the best part of  their land:      --Experiar quid concedatur in illos    Quorum Flaminia tegitur cinis, atque Latina.                  _Juv. Sat I._    The Romans commonly built tombs for themselves during their lifetime.  Hence these words frequently occur in ancient inscriptions, V.F. Vivus  Facit, V.S.P. Vivus Sibi Posuit. The tombs of the rich were usually  constructed of marble, the ground enclosed with walls, and planted round  with trees. But common sepulchres were usually built below ground, and  called hypogea. There were niches cut out of the walls, in which the  urns were placed: these, from their resemblance to the niche of a  pigeon-house, were called columbaria.        [4] Our blessed Saviour chose the garden sometime for his      oratory, and, dying, for the place of his sepulture; and we also      do avouch, for many weighty causes, that there are none more fit      to bury our dead in than in our gardens and groves where our      beds may he decked with verdant and fragrant flowers. Trees and      perennial plants, the most natural and instructive hieroglyphics      of our expected resurrection and immortality, besides what they      might conduce to the meditation of the living, and the taking      off our cogitations from dwelling too intently upon more vain      and sensual objects: that custom of burying in churches, and      near about them, especially in great and populous cities, being      both a novel presumption, indecent, and very prejudicial to      health.--_Evelyn's Discourse on Forest Trees_.           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.      PREPARATIONS FOR A JOURNEY.      I am fond of travelling: yet I never undertake a journey without  experiencing a vague feeling of melancholy. There is to me something  strangely oppressive in the preliminaries of departure. The packing of a  small valise; the settlement of accounts--justly pronounced by Rabelais  a _blue-devilish_ process; the regulation of books and papers;--in  short, the whole routine of valedictory arrangements, are to me as a  nightmare on the waking spirit. They induce a mood of last wills and  testaments--a sense of dislocation, which, next to a vacuum, Nature  abhors--and create a species of moral decomposition, not unlike that  effected on matter by chemical agency. It is not that I have to lament  the disruption of social connexions or domestic ties. This, I am aware,  is a trial sometimes borne with exemplary fortitude; and I was lately  edified by the magnanimous unconcern with which a married friend of mine  sang the last verse of \"Home! sweet home!\" as the chaise which was to  convey him from the _burthen_ of his song drove up to the door. It does  not become a bachelor to speculate on the mysteries of matrimonial  philosophy; but the feeling of pain with which _I_ enter on the task of  migration has no affinity with individual sympathies, or even with  domiciliary attachments. My landlady is, without exception, the ugliest  woman in London; and the locality of Elbow-lane cannot be supposed  absolutely to spellbind the affection of one occupying, as I do,  solitary chambers on the third floor.    The case, it may be supposed, is much worse when it is my lot to take  leave, after passing a few weeks at the house of a friend in the  country;--a house, for instance, such as is to be met with only in  England:--with about twenty acres of lawn, but no park; with a  shrubbery, but no made-grounds; with well-furnished rooms, but no  conservatory; and with a garden, in which dandy tulips and high-bred  anemones do not disdain the fellowship of honest artichokes and laughing  cauliflowers--no bad illustration of the republican union of comfort  with elegance which reigns through the whole establishment. The master  of the mansion, perhaps an old and valued schoolfellow:--his wife, a  well-bred, accomplished, and still beautiful woman--cordial, without  vulgarity--refined, without pretension--and informed, without a shade of  blue! Their children!... But my reader will complete the picture, and  imagine, better than I can describe, how one of my temperament must  suffer at quitting such a scene. At six o'clock on the dreaded morning,  the friendly old butler knocks at my room-door, to warn me that the mail  will pass in half an hour at the end of the green lane. On descending to  the parlour, I find that my old friend has, in spite of our over-night  agreement and a slight touch of gout, come down to see me off. His  amiable lady is pouring out for me a cup of tea--assuring me that she  would be quite unhappy at allowing me to depart without that  indispensable prelude to a journey. A gig waits at the door: my  affectionate host will not permit me to walk even half a mile. The  minutes pass unheeded; till, with a face of busy but cordial concern,  the old butler reminds me that the mail is at hand. I bid a hasty and  agitated farewell, and turn with loathing to the forced companionship of  a public vehicle.    My anti-leave-taking foible is certainly not so much affected when I  quit the residence of an hotel--that public home--that wearisome  resting-place--that epitome of the world--that compound of gregarious  incompatibilities--that bazaar of character--that proper resort of  semi-social egotism and unamalgable individualities--that troublous  haven, where the vessel may ride and tack, half-sheltered, but finds no  anchorage. Yet even the Lilliputian ligatures of such a sojourn  imperceptibly twine round my lethargic habits, and bind me, Gulliver-  like, a passive fixture. Once, in particular, I remember to have _stuck_  at the Hotel des Bons Enfants, in Paris--a place with nothing to  recommend it to one of ordinary locomotive energies. But there I stuck.  Business of importance called me to Bordeaux. I lingered for two months.  At length, by one of those nervous efforts peculiar to weak resolutions,  I made my arrangements, secured my emancipation, and found myself on the  way to the starting-place of the Diligence. I well remember the day:  'twas a rainy afternoon in spring. The aspect of the gayest city in the  world was dreary and comfortless. The rain dripped perpendicularly from  the eves of the houses, exemplifying the axiom, that lines are composed  of a succession of points. At the corners of the streets it shot a  curved torrent from the projecting spouts, flooding the channels, and  drenching, with a sudden drum-like sound, the passing umbrellas, whose  varied tints of pink, blue, and orange, like the draggled finery of  feathers and flounces beneath them, only made the scene more glaringly  desolate. Then came the rush and splatter of cabriolets, scattering  terror and defilement. The well-mounted English dandy shows his sense by  hoisting his parapluie; the French dragoon curls his mustachio at such  effeminacy, and braves the liquid bullets in the genuine spirit of  Marengo; the old French count picks his elastic steps with the placid  and dignified philosophy of the _ancien regime_; while the Parisian  dames, of all ranks, ages, and degrees, trip along, with one leg  undraped, exactly in proportion to the shapeliness of its configuration.    The huge clock of the Messageries Royales told three as I entered the  gateway. The wide court had an air of humid dreariness. On one side  stood a dozen of those moving caravansaras, the national vehicles, with  their leathern caps--like those of Danish sailors in a north-wester--  hanging half off, soaked with wet. Opposite was the range of offices,  busy with all the peculiar importance of French _bureaucracie._ Their  clerks, decorated with ribbons and crosses, wield their pens with all  the conscious dignity of secretaries of state; and \"_book_\" a bale or a  parcel as though they were signing a treaty, or granting an amnesty. The  meanest _employe_ seems to think himself invested with certain occult  powers. His civility savours of government patronage; and his frown is  inquisitorial. To his fellows, his address is abrupt and diplomatic. He  seems to speak in cipher, and to gesticulate by some rule of  freemasonry. But to the _uninitiated_ he is explanatory to a scruple, as  though mischief might ensue from his being misapprehended. He makes sure  of your understanding by an emphasis, which reminds one of the loudness  of tone used towards a person supposed to be hard of hearing--a  proceeding not very flattering where there happens to be neither dulness  nor deafness in the case. In a word, the measured pedantry of his whole  deportment betrays the happy conviction in which he rejoices of being  conversant with matters little dreamt of in your philosophy. Among the  bystanders, too, there are some who might, probably with more reason,  boast their proficiency in mysterious lore--fellows of smooth aspect and  polite demeanour, whom at first you imagine to have become casual  spectators from mere lack of better pastime, but whose furtive glances  and vagrant attention betray the familiars of the police--that complex  and mighty engine of modern structure, which, far more surely than the  \"ear of Dionysius,\" conveys to the tympanum of power each echoed sigh  and reverberated whisper. It is a chilling thing to feel one's budding  confidence in a new acquaintance nipped by such frosty suspicions;  yet--Heaven forgive me!--the bare idea has, before now, caused me to  drop, unscented,"]]]
