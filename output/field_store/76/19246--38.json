I could go no further that night, yet before I  lay down to sleep I decided to go and look over the edge of a wide  depression in the moor that I saw a little way off. So I left the  track and walked a few hundred yards, and when I got to the edge the  hollow was full of mist all white underneath me. Another star appeared  and a cold wind arose, and with the wind the mist flapped away like a  curtain. And there was the city.    Nothing the shepherd had said was the least untrue or even  exaggerated. The poor old man had told the simple truth, there is not  a city like it in the world. What he had called thin spires were  minarets, but the little domes on the top were clearly pure gold as he  said. There were the marble terraces he described and the pure white  palaces covered with carving and hundreds of minarets. The city was  obviously of the East and yet where there should have been crescents  on the domes of the minarets there were golden suns with rays, and  wherever one looked one saw things that obscured its origin. I walked  down to it, and, passing through a wicket gate of gold in a low wall  of white marble, I entered the city. The heather went right up to the  city's edge and beat against the marble wall whenever the wind blew  it. Lights began to twinkle from high windows of blue glass as I  walked up the white street, beautiful copper lanterns were lit up and  let down from balconies by silver chains, from doors ajar came the  sound of voices singing, and then I saw the men. Their faces were  rather grey than black, and they wore beautiful robes of coloured silk  with hems embroidered with gold and some with copper, and sometimes  pacing down the marble ways with golden baskets hung on each side of  them I saw the camels of which the old shepherd spoke.    The people had kindly faces, but, though they were evidently friendly  to strangers, I could not speak with them being ignorant of their  language, nor were the sounds of the syllables they used like any  language I had ever heard: they sounded more like grouse.    When I tried to ask them by signs whence they had come with their city  they would only point to the moon, which was bright and full and was  shining fiercely on those marble ways till the city danced in light.  And now there began appearing one by one, slipping softly out through  windows, men with stringed instruments in the balconies. They were  strange instruments with huge bulbs of wood, and they played softly on  them and very beautifully, and their queer voices softly sang to the  music weird dirges of the griefs of their native land wherever that  may be. And far off in the heart of the city others were singing too,  the sound of it came to me wherever I roamed, not loud enough to  disturb my thoughts, but gently turning the mind to pleasant things.  Slender carved arches of marble, as delicate almost as lace, crossed  and re-crossed the ways wherever I went. There was none of that hurry  of which foolish cities boast, nothing ugly or sordid so far as I  could see. I saw that it was a city of beauty and song. I wondered how  they had travelled with all that marble, how they had laid it down on  Mallington Moor, whence they had come and what their resources were,  and determined to investigate closely next morning, for the old  shepherd had not troubled his head to think how the city came, he had  only noted that the city was there (and of course no one believed him,  though that is partly his fault for his dissolute ways). But at night  one can see little and I had walked all day, so I determined to find a  place to rest in. And just as I was wondering whether to ask for  shelter of those silk-robed men by signs or whether to sleep outside  the walls and enter again in the morning, I came to a great archway in  one of the marble houses with two black curtains, embroidered below  with gold, hanging across it. Over the archway were carved apparently  in many tongues the words: \"Here strangers rest.\" In Greek, Latin and  Spanish the sentence was repeated and there was writing also in the  language that you see on the walls of the great temples of Egypt, and  Arabic and what I took to be early Assyrian and one or two languages I  had never seen. I entered through the curtains and found a tesselated  marble court with golden braziers burning sleepy incense swinging by  chains from the roof, all round the walls were comfortable mattresses  lying upon the floor covered with cloths and silks. It must have been  ten o'clock and I was tired. Outside the music still softly filled the  streets, a man had set a lantern down on the marble way, five or six  sat down round him, and he was sonorously telling them a story. Inside  there were some already asleep on the beds, in the middle of the wide  court under the braziers a woman dressed in blue was singing very  gently, she did not move, but sung on and on, I never heard a song  that was so soothing. I lay down on one of the mattresses by the wall,  which was all inlaid with mosaics, and pulled over me some of the  cloths with their beautiful alien work, and almost immediately my  thoughts seemed part of the song that the woman was singing in the  midst of the court under the golden braziers that hung from the high  roof, and the song turned them to dreams, and so I fell asleep.    A small wind having arisen, I was awakened by a sprig of heather that  beat continually against my face. It was morning on Mallington Moor,  and the city was quite gone.            Why the Milkman Shudders When He Perceives the Dawn    In the Hall of the Ancient Company of Milkmen round the great  fireplace at the end, when the winter logs are burning and all the  craft are assembled they tell to-day, as their grandfathers told  before them, why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn.    When dawn comes creeping over the edges of hills, peers through the  tree-trunks making wonderful shadows, touches the tops of tall columns  of smoke going up from awakening cottages in the valleys, and breaks  all golden over Kentish fields, when going on tip-toe thence it comes  to the walls of London and slips all shyly up those gloomy streets the  milkman perceives it and shudders.    A man may be a Milkman's Working Apprentice, may know what borax is  and how to mix it, yet not for that is the story told to him. There  are five men alone that tell that story, five men appointed by the  Master of the Company, by whom each place is filled as it falls  vacant, and if you do not hear it from one of them you hear the story  from no one and so can never know why the milkman shudders when he  perceives the dawn.    It is the way of one of these five men, greybeards all and milkmen  from infancy, to rub his hands by the fire when the great logs burn,  and to settle himself more easily in his chair, perhaps to sip some  drink far other than milk, then to look round to see that none are  there to whom it would not be fitting the tale should be told and,  looking from face to face and seeing none but the men of the Ancient  Company, and questioning mutely the rest of the five with his eyes, if  some of the five be there, and receiving their permission, to cough  and to tell the tale. And a great hush falls in the Hall of the  Ancient Company, and something about the shape of the roof and the  rafters makes the tale resonant all down the hall so that the youngest  hears it far away from the fire and knows, and dreams of the day when  perhaps he will tell himself why the milkman shudders when he  perceives the dawn.    Not as one tells some casual fact is it told, nor is it commented on  from man to man, but it is told by that great fire only and when the  occasion and the stillness of the room and the merit of the wine and  the profit of all seem to warrant it in the opinion of the five  deputed men: then does one of them tell it, as I have said, not  heralded by any master of ceremonies but as though it arose out of the  warmth of the fire before which his knotted hands would chance to be;  not a thing learned by rote, but told differently by each teller, and  differently according to his mood, yet never has one of them dared to  alter its salient points, there is none so base among the Company of  Milkmen. The Company of Powderers for the Face know of this story and  have envied it, the Worthy Company of Chin-Barbers, and the Company of  Whiskerers; but none have heard it in the Milkmen's Hall, through  whose wall no rumour of the secret goes, and though they have invented  tales of their own Antiquity mocks them.    This mellow story was ripe with honourable years when milkmen wore  beaver hats, its origin was still mysterious when smocks were the  vogue, men asked one another when Stuarts were on the throne (and only  the Ancient Company knew the answer) why the milkman shudders when he  perceives the dawn. It is all for envy of this tale's reputation that  the Company of Powderers for the Face have invented the tale that they  too tell of an evening, \"Why the Dog Barks when he hears the step of  the Baker\"; and because probably all men know that tale the Company of  the Powderers for the Face have dared to consider it famous. Yet it  lacks mystery and is not ancient, is not fortified with classical  allusion, has no secret lore, is common to all who care for an idle  tale, and shares with \"The Wars of the Elves,\" the Calf-butcher's  tale, and \"The Story of the Unicorn and the Rose,\" which is the tale  of the Company of Horse-drivers, their obvious inferiority.    But unlike all these tales so new to time, and many another that the  last two centuries tell, the tale that the milkmen tell ripples wisely  on, so full of quotation from the profoundest writers, so full of  recondite allusion, so deeply tinged with all the wisdom of man and  instructive"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13831"],[0,"Evolution Of The Japanese, Social And Psychic (#5)"],[1,"was pointed out. For while such works please       a certain section of the English public, they do a great deal of       harm among a section of the Japanese public, as could be easily       shown in detail, did space allow.\"--_Japan Mail, May 7, 1898_.    But even more harmful to the reading public of England and America are  the hastily formed yet, nevertheless, widely published opinions of  tourists and newspaper correspondents. Could such writers realize the  inevitable limitations under which they see and try to generalize, the  world would be spared many crudities and exaggerations, not to say  positive errors. The impression so common to-day that Japan's recent  developments are anomalous, even contrary to the laws of national  growth, is chiefly due to the superficial writings of hasty observers.  Few of those who have dilated ecstatically on her recent growth have  understood either the history or the genius of her people.         \"To mention but one among many examples,\" says Prof. Chamberlain,       \"the ingenious Traveling Commissioner of the _Pall Mall Gazette_,       Mr. Henry Norman, in his lively letters on Japan published nine or       ten years ago, tells the story of Japanese education under the       fetching title of 'A Nation at School'; but the impression left is       that they have been their own schoolmasters. In another letter on       'Japan in Arms,' he discourses concerning 'The Japanese Military       Re-organizers,' 'The Yokosuka dockyard,' and other matters, but       omits to mention that the reorganizers were Frenchmen, and that the       Yokosuka dockyard was also a French creation. Similarly, when       treating of the development of the Japanese newspaper, he ignores       the fact that it owed its origin to an Englishman, which surely, to       a man whose object was reality, should have seemed an object worth       recording. These letters, so full and apparently so frank, really       so deceptive, are, as we have said, but one instance among many of       the way in which popular writers on Japan travesty history by       ignoring the part which foreigners have played. The reasons for       this are not far to seek. A wonderful tale will please folks at a       distance all the better if made more wonderful still. Japanese       progress, traced to its causes and explained by references to the       means employed, is not nearly such fascinating reading as when       represented in the guise of a fairy creation, sprung from nothing,       like Aladdin's palace.\"--\"_Things Japanese,\" p. 116_.    But inter-racial misunderstanding is not, after all, so very strange.  Few things are more difficult than to accommodate one's self in  speech, in methods of life, and even in thought, to an alien people;  so identifying one's deepest interest with theirs as really to  understand them. The minds of most men are so possessed by notions  acquired in childhood and youth as to be unable to see even the  plainest facts at variance with those notions. He who comes to Japan  possessed with the idea that it is a dreamland and that its old social  order was free from defects, is blind to any important facts  invalidating that conception; while he who is persuaded that Japan,  being Oriental, is necessarily pagan at heart, however civilized in  form, cannot easily be persuaded that there is anything praiseworthy  in her old civilization, in her moral or religious life, or in any of  her customs.    If France fails in important respects to understand England; and  England, Germany; and Germany, its neighbors; if even England and  America can so misunderstand one another as to be on the verge of war  over the boundary dispute of an alien country, what hope is there that  the Occident shall understand the Orient, or the Orient the Occident?    Though the difficulty seems insurmountable, I am persuaded that the  most fruitful cause of racial misunderstandings and of defective  descriptions both of the West by Orientals, and of the East by  Occidentals, is a well-nigh universal misconception as to the nature  of man, and of society, and consequently of the laws determining their  development. In the East this error arises from and rests upon its  polytheism, and the accompanying theories of special national creation  and peculiar national sanctity. On these grounds alien races are  pronounced necessarily inferior. China's scorn for foreigners is due  to these ideas.    Although this pagan notion has been theoretically abandoned in the  West, it still dominates the thought not only of the multitudes, but  also of many who pride themselves on their high education and liberal  sentiments. They bring to the support of their national or racial  pride such modern sociological theories as lend themselves to this  view. Evolution and the survival of the fittest, degeneration and the  arrest of development, are appealed to as justifying the arrogance and  domineering spirit of Western nations.    But the most subtle and scholarly doctrine appealed to in support of  national pride is the biological conception of society. Popular  writers assume that society is a biological organism and that the laws  of its evolution are therefore biological. This assumption is not  strange, for until recent times the most advanced professional  sociologists have been dominated by the same misconception. Spencer,  for example, makes sociology a branch of biology. More recent  sociological writers, however, such as Professors Giddings and  Fairbanks, have taken special pains to assert the essentially psychic  character of society; they reject the biological conception, as  inadequate to express the real nature of society. The biological  conception, they insist, is nothing more than a comparison, useful for  bringing out certain features of the social life and structure, but  harmful if understood as their full statement. The laws of psychic  activity and development differ as widely from those of biologic  activity and development as these latter do from those that hold in  the chemical world. If the laws which regulate psychic development and  the progress of civilization were understood by popular writers on  Japan, and if the recent progress of Japan had been stated in the  terms of these laws, there would not have been so much mystification  in the West in regard to this matter as there evidently has been.  Japan would not have appeared to have \"jumped out of her skin,\" or  suddenly to have escaped from the heredity of her past millenniums of  development. This wide misunderstanding of Japan, then, is not simply  due to the fact that \"Japanese progress, traced to its causes and  explained by reference to the means employed, is not nearly such  fascinating reading as when represented in the guise of a fairy  creation,\" but it is also due to the still current popular view that  the social organism is biological, and subject therefore to the laws  of biological evolution. On this assumption, some hold that the  progress of Japan, however it may appear, is really superficial, while  others represent it as somehow having evaded the laws regulating the  development of other races. A nation's character and characteristics  are conceived to be the product of brain-structure; these can change  only as brain structure changes. Brain is held to determine  civilization, rather than civilization brain. Hampered by this  defective view, popular writers inevitably describe Japan to the West  in terms that necessarily misrepresent her, and that at the same time  pander to Occidental pride and prejudice.    But this misunderstanding of Japan reveals an equally profound  misunderstanding in regard to ourselves. Occidental peoples are  supposed to be what they are in civilization and to have reached their  high attainments in theoretical and applied science, in philosophy and  in practical politics, because of their unique brain-structures,  brains secured through millenniums of biological evolution. The  following statement may seem to be rank heresy to the average  sociologist, but my studies have led me to believe that the main  differences between the great races of mankind to-day are not due to  biological, but to social conditions; they are not  physico-psychological differences, but only socio-psychological  differences. The Anglo-Saxon is what he is because of his social  heredity, and the Chinaman is what he is because of his social  heredity. The profound difference between social and physiological  heredity and evolution is unappreciated except by a few of the most  recent sociological writers. The part that association, social  segregation, and social heredity take in the maintenance, not only of  once developed languages and civilizations, but even in their genesis,  has been generally overlooked.    But a still more important factor in the determination of social and  psychic evolution, generally unrecognized by sociologists, is the  nature and function of personality. Although in recent years it has  been occasionally mentioned by several eminent writers, personality as  a principle has not been made the core of any system of sociology. In  my judgment, however, this is the distinctive characteristic of human  evolution and of human association, and it should accordingly be the  fundamental principle of social science. Many writers on the East have  emphasized what they call its \"impersonal\" characteristics. So  important is this subject that I have considered it at length in the  body of this work.    Sociological phenomena cannot be fully expressed by any combination of  exclusively physical, biological, and psychic terms, for the  significant element of man and of society consists of something more  than these--namely, personality. It is this that differentiates human  from animal evolution. The unit of human sociology is a  self-conscious, self-determinative being. The causative factor in the  social evolution "]]]
