[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12797"],[0,"The Log of a Cowboy: A Narrative of the Old Trail Days (#5)"],[1," at breakfast on the  morning of our start he gave in substance these general directions:--    \"Boys, the secret of trailing cattle is never to let your herd know  that they are under restraint. Let everything that is done be done  voluntarily by the cattle. From the moment you let them off the bed  ground in the morning until they are bedded at night, never let a cow  take a step, except in the direction of its destination. In this  manner you can loaf away the day, and cover from fifteen to twenty  miles, and the herd in the mean time will enjoy all the freedom of an  open range. Of course, it's long, tiresome hours to the men; but the  condition of the herd and saddle stock demands sacrifices on our part,  if any have to be made. And I want to caution you younger boys about  your horses; there is such a thing as having ten horses in your  string, and at the same time being afoot. You are all well mounted,  and on the condition of the _remuda_ depends the success and safety of  the herd. Accidents will happen to horses, but don't let it be your  fault; keep your saddle blankets dry and clean, for no better word can  be spoken of a man than that he is careful of his horses. Ordinarily a  man might get along with six or eight horses, but in such emergencies  as we are liable to meet, we have not a horse to spare, and a man  afoot is useless.\"    And as all of us younger boys learned afterward, there was plenty of  good, solid, horse-sense in Flood's advice; for before the trip ended  there were men in our outfit who were as good as afoot, while others  had their original mounts, every one fit for the saddle. Flood had  insisted on a good mount of horses, and Lovell was cowman enough to  know that what the mule is to the army the cow-horse is to the herd.    The first and second day out there was no incident worth mentioning.  We traveled slowly, hardly making an average day's drive. The third  morning Flood left us, to look out a crossing on the Arroyo Colorado.  On coming down to receive the herd, we had crossed this sluggish bayou  about thirty-six miles north of Brownsville. It was a  deceptive-looking stream, being over fifty feet deep and between bluff  banks. We ferried our wagon and saddle horses over, swimming the loose  ones. But the herd was keeping near the coast line for the sake of  open country, and it was a question if there was a ford for the wagon  as near the coast as our course was carrying us. The murmurings of the  Gulf had often reached our ears the day before, and herds had been  known, in former years, to cross from the mainland over to Padre  Island, the intervening Laguna Madre being fordable.    We were nooning when Flood returned with the news that it would be  impossible to cross our wagon at any point on the bayou, and that we  would have to ford around the mouth of the stream. Where the fresh and  salt water met in the laguna, there had formed a delta, or shallow  bar; and by following its contour we would not have over twelve to  fourteen inches of water, though the half circle was nearly two miles  in length. As we would barely have time to cross that day, the herd  was at once started, veering for the mouth of the Arroyo Colorado. On  reaching it, about the middle of the afternoon, the foreman led the  way, having crossed in the morning and learned the ford. The wagon  followed, the saddle horses came next, while the herd brought up the  rear. It proved good footing on the sandbar, but the water in the  laguna was too salty for the cattle, though the loose horses lay down  and wallowed in it. We were about an hour in crossing, and on reaching  the mainland met a vaquero, who directed us to a large fresh-water  lake a few miles inland, where we camped for the night.    It proved an ideal camp, with wood, water, and grass in abundance, and  very little range stock to annoy us. We had watered the herd just  before noon, and before throwing them upon the bed ground for the  night, watered them a second time. We had a splendid camp-fire that  night, of dry live oak logs, and after supper was over and the first  guard had taken the herd, smoking and story telling were the order of  the evening. The camp-fire is to all outdoor life what the evening  fireside is to domestic life. After the labors of the day are over,  the men gather around the fire, and the social hour of the day is  spent in yarning. The stories told may run from the sublime to the  ridiculous, from a true incident to a base fabrication, or from a  touching bit of pathos to the most vulgar vulgarity.    \"Have I ever told this outfit my experience with the vigilantes when I  was a kid?\" inquired Bull Durham. There was a general negative  response, and he proceeded. \"Well, our folks were living on the Frio  at the time, and there was a man in our neighborhood who had an outfit  of four men out beyond Nueces Canon hunting wild cattle for their  hides. It was necessary to take them out supplies about every so  often, and on one trip he begged my folks to let me go along for  company. I was a slim slip of a colt about fourteen at the time, and  as this man was a friend of ours, my folks consented to let me go  along. We each had a good saddle horse, and two pack mules with  provisions and ammunition for the hunting camp. The first night we  made camp, a boy overtook us with the news that the brother of my  companion had been accidentally killed by a horse, and of course he  would have to return. Well, we were twenty miles on our way, and as it  would take some little time to go back and return with the loaded  mules, I volunteered, like a fool kid, to go on and take the packs  through.    \"The only question was, could I pack and unpack. I had helped him at  this work, double-handed, but now that I was to try it alone, he  showed me what he called a squaw hitch, with which you can lash a pack  single-handed. After putting me through it once or twice, and  satisfying himself that I could do the packing, he consented to let me  go on, he and the messenger returning home during the night. The next  morning I packed without any trouble and started on my way. It would  take me two days yet, poking along with heavy packs, to reach the  hunters. Well, I hadn't made over eight or ten miles the first  morning, when, as I rounded a turn in the trail, a man stepped out  from behind a rock, threw a gun in my face, and ordered me to hold up  my hands. Then another appeared from the opposite side with his gun  leveled on me. Inside of half a minute a dozen men galloped up from  every quarter, all armed to the teeth. The man on leaving had given me  his gun for company, one of these old smoke-pole, cap-and-ball  six-shooters, but I must have forgotten what guns were for, for I  elevated my little hands nicely. The leader of the party questioned me  as to who I was, and what I was doing there, and what I had in those  packs. That once, at least, I told the truth. Every mother's son of  them was cursing and cross-questioning me in the same breath. They  ordered me off my horse, took my gun, and proceeded to verify my tale  by unpacking the mules. So much ammunition aroused their suspicions,  but my story was as good as it was true, and they never shook me from  the truth of it. I soon learned that robbery was not their motive, and  the leader explained the situation.    \"A vigilance committee had been in force in that county for some time,  trying to rid the country of lawless characters. But lawlessness got  into the saddle, and had bench warrants issued and served on every  member of this vigilance committee. As the vigilantes numbered several  hundred, there was no jail large enough to hold such a number, so they  were released on parole for appearance at court. When court met, every  man served with a capias\"--    \"Hold on! hold your horses just a minute,\" interrupted Quince Forrest,  \"I want to get that word. I want to make a memorandum of it, for I may  want to use it myself sometime. Capias? Now I have it; go ahead.\"    \"When court met, every man served with a bench warrant from the judge  presiding was present, and as soon as court was called to order, a  squad of men arose in the court room, and the next moment the judge  fell riddled with lead. Then the factions scattered to fight it out,  and I was passing through the county while matters were active.    \"They confiscated my gun and all the ammunition in the packs, but  helped me to repack and started me on my way. A happy thought struck  one of the men to give me a letter, which would carry me through  without further trouble, but the leader stopped him, saying, 'Let the  boy alone. Your letter would hang him as sure as hell's hot, before he  went ten miles farther.' I declined the letter. Even then I didn't  have sense enough to turn back, and inside of two hours I was rounded  up by the other faction. I had learned my story perfectly by this  time, but those packs had to come off again for everything to be  examined. There was nothing in them now but flour and salt and such  things--nothing that they might consider suspicious. One fellow in  this second party took a fancy to my horse, and offered to help hang  me on general principles, but kinder counsels prevailed. They also  helped me to repack, and I started on once more. Before I reached my  destination the following evening, I was held up seven different  times. I got so used to it that I was happily disappointed every  shelter I passed, if some man did not step out and throw a gun in my  face.    \"I had trouble to convince the cattle hunters of my experiences, but  the absence of any ammunition, which they needed worst, at last led  them to give credit to my tale. I was expected home within a week, as  I was to go down on the Nueces on a cow hunt which was making up, and  I only rested one day at the hunters' camp. On their advice, I took a  different route on my way home, leaving the mules behind me. I never  saw a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12809"],[0,"Quiet Talks about Jesus (#5)"],[1,"classic from Paul's pen, about the effect of sin upon  man's mental processes. A few lines in the letter to the Ephesian circle  of churches give a sort of bill of details of the mental steps down that  slope from the Eden gate.    Paul is urging these friends to live _no longer_ as they, in common with  all the races, had been living, in \"the vanity of their mind, being  darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because  of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their  hearts; who, being past feeling, gave themselves up to lasciviousness to  make a greedy trade of all uncleanness.\" Here are seven steps down. The  first five are put in reverse order. Beginning where they have been, he  traces the five steps back to the starting point, and then adds the two  likely to follow with any who persist past this point.    The start of all sin is in the setting of one's self against God. Choosing  some other way than His. It is called here \"hardening of the heart.\" The  native juices of the heart are drawn away from God and dry up. In this  Book the heart is the seat of both affection and will. It is the pivotal  organ of life. Any trouble there quickly and surely affects the whole  being. Then follows \"ignorance.\" Of course. The heart controls both ear  and eye, the two great channels inward of knowledge. The hardening of the  heart locks both doors. And hard on the heels of that comes \"_Alienated_  from the life of God.\" That is, _cut off,_ shut out of fellowship and  intimacy. Life is _union with God_. Through union God's life flows into  us. Union is rooted in knowledge _and_ in sympathy, fellow-feeling, a  common desire and purpose. The man snapping that tying cord cuts himself  off.    The next step is peculiarly pathetic--\"darkened in their understanding.\"  The man has shut the shutters close, and pulled the shades down tight. Of  course it's dark inside. He is unable to see. First unwilling, now unable.  If the only thing that can be gotten for use as light be _darkness_, how  intense is that darkness! Then comes the pitiable result of acting as if  darkness were man's native air--\"the vanity of the mind.\" That word vanity  means aimlessness. The mind is still keen, even brilliant, but the guiding  star is shut out, and that keen mind goes whirring aimlessly around.  Sometimes a very earnest aimlessness. The man's on a foggy sea without sun  or star. The compass on board is useless.    But more pitiable and pathetic yet; indeed utterly laughable if it were  not so terribly serious and pathetic:--this man in the dark proceeds  gravely to decide that this darkness of his own making is a superior sort  of light, and bows low in worship of its maker. He has even been known to  write brilliant essays on the light-giving power of blinding darkness,  with earnest protests at the evil of this thing commonly called light.  Sometimes having carefully cottoned up the shutters that no scrap of sun  light or sun warmth may get in, he strikes a friction match, and sits  warming himself, and eloquently sets forth his own greatness as shown by  the match, _friction_ match. Most of this sort of light and heat is of the  friction sort.    Then with reluctant hand, one who knows Paul's tender heart can well  believe, the curtain is drawn aside for the last two stages; the grosser,  gutter, animal stages, which, not always by any means, but all too  commonly follow. \"Past feeling!\" The delicate sense of feeling about right  and purity dulls and goes. The fine inner judgment blunts and leaves. The  shrinking sensitiveness toward the dishonorable and impure loses its edge  and departs. _Then_--pell mell, like a pack of dogs down a steep hill,  follows the last--\"lasciviousness,\" the purest, holiest things in the  gutter-slime, and then, cold-blooded, greedy trading in these things.  That's the picture painted in shadows of Rembrandt blackness, newly  blackened, of the effect in man himself of turning away from God.    Now Jesus is the music of God's heart sounding in man's ears anew, that he  may be wooed back the old road to the Eden life. Jesus is the face of God,  close up, looking tenderly, yearningly, into man's face, that his eye may  be caught and held, and his heart be enchained.        <u>Sin's Brood.</u>      The second great result of that Eden break has been in _the growth of  sin_. In the seventeenth century after that it was said that man's heart  was a breeding place of thoughts whose pictured forms were bad, only bad,  with no spots of good, nor spurts of good. A thousand years later, Moses  giving the Hebrew tribes the ten commandments, adds a crowd of  particulars, some of them very grewsome, which serve as mirrors to reveal  the common practice of his age. The slant down of those first centuries  has evidently been increasing in its downward pitch.    More than a thousand years later yet, there is a summary made by Paul that  reveals the stage reached by sin in his day. Probably no one knew the  world of his time, which has proved to be the world's crisis time, as did  Paul the scholar and philosopher of Tarsus. Himself a city man, well bred  and well schooled, a world traveller, with acute, disciplined powers of  observation, and a calm scholarly judgment, he had studied every phase of  life cultured and lowly.    He pitched upon the great city centres in his active campaigning, and  worked out into the country districts. He was a world-bred man. He knew  the three over-lapping worlds of his time: the Hebrew, with its ideals of  purity and religion; the Greek, with its ideals of culture; and the Roman,  with its ideals of organization and conquest. He is writing from Corinth,  then the centre of Greek life, to Rome, the centre of the world's life.  His letter is the most elaborate of any of his writings preserved to us.  In its beginning he speaks of man, universally, morally, as he had come to  know him. His arraignment is simply terrific in its sweep and detail.    Let me pause and be measuring the words cautiously and then put this  down:--the description of the latter half of the first chapter of Romans  is a true description of man to-day. At first flush that sounds shocking,  as indeed it is. It seems as if this description can apply only to  degraded savages and to earth's darkest corners. But the history of Paul's  day, and before, and since, and an under view of the social fabric to-day,  only serve to make clear that Paul's description is true for all time, and  around the world.    There is a cloak of conventionality thrown over the blacker tints of the  picture to-day in advanced Christian lands. It is considered proper to  avoid speaking of certain excesses, or, if speech must be used, modestly  to say \"unnamable.\" And it is a distinct gain for morality that it is so.  Better a standard recognized, even though broken. But commonly the  conditions are not changed. The differences found in different  civilizations to-day are differences only of _degree_. In the most  advanced cities of Christendom to-day may be found every bit of this  chapter's awful details, _but properly cloaked_. In European lands the  cloaks are sewed with the legal-stitch, which is considered the proper  finish. In lands where our Christian standards are not recognized the  thing is as open as in this chapter.    In four short paragraphs containing sixty-six lines in the American  Revision, Paul packs in his terrific philippic. He swings over the ground  four times. Nowhere does he reveal better his own fidelity to truth, with  the fineness of his own spirit. Here, delicacy of expression is rarely  blended with great plainness. No one can fail to understand, and yet that  sense of modesty native to both man and woman is not improperly disturbed,  even though the recital be shocking.    Here is paragraph one: Man knew God both through nature and by the direct  inner light. But he did not want Him as God. It bothered the way he wanted  to live. The core of all sin is there. All its fruitage grows about that  core. He became vain in his reasonings. He gave himself up to keen,  brilliant speculation. Having cut the cord that bound him to God,  unanchored, uncompassed, on a shoreless, starless sea, he drifts  brilliantly about in the dense gray fog.    Then he befooled himself further by thinking himself wise. He preferred  somebody else to God. Whom? Himself! Then--birds; then-beasts on all fours  with backbone on a line with the earth, nose and mouth close to the  ground; then--gray-black, slimy, crawling, creeping things. He traded off  the truth of God for a lie; the sweet purity of God for rank impurity. He  dethroned God, and took the seat himself. He bartered God for beasts and  grew like that he preferred. God's gracious restraint is withdrawn when he  gets down to the animal stage. Only here man out-animalled the animals.  The beasts are given points on beastliness. The life he chose to live held  down by the throat the truth he knew so well. That's the first summary.    The next two paragraphs are devoted to that particular sort of unnatural  sin first suggested to man after his disobedience, and which in all time  and all lands has been and is the worst, the most unnatural, the most  degrading, and the most common. It came first in the imagination. It came  early in the history of actual sin. It is put first by Paul in his  arraignment here. He gives it chief place by position and by particularity  of description. First was the using of a pure, natural function to gratify  unnatural desires. Then with strange cunning and lustful ingenuity  changing the natural functions to uses not in the plan of nature. Let it  all be said in lowest, softest voice, so sadly awful is the recital. Yet  let that soft voice be very distinct, that the truth may be known. Then  lower down yet the commercializing of such things. Unconcerned barter and  trade in man's holy, most potent function. "]]]
