I could speak but little French, and supposed they could  speak no English, so I stepped to the door to see for the page that  brought me thither, but seeing nobody there and the passage clear,  I made off as fast as I could, without speaking a word; nor did the  other two gentlemen offer to stop me.    But I was in a strange confusion when, coming into those entries and  passages which the page led me through, I could by no means find my  way out. At last seeing a door open that looked through a house into  the street, I went in, and out at the other door; but then I was at  as great a loss to know where I was, and which was the way to my  lodgings. The wound in my thigh bled apace, and I could feel the blood  in my breeches. In this interval came by a chair; I called, and went  into it, and bid them, as well as I could, go to the Louvre; for  though I knew not the name of the street where I lodged, I knew I  could find the way to it when I was at the Bastille. The chairmen went  on their own way, and being stopped by a company of the guards as they  went, set me down till the soldiers were marched by; when looking out  I found I was just at my own lodging, and the captain was standing at  the door looking for me. I beckoned him to me, and, whispering, told  him I was very much hurt, but bid him pay the chairmen, and ask no  questions but come to me.    I made the best of my way upstairs, but had lost so much blood, that I  had hardly spirits enough to keep me from swooning till he came in.  He was equally concerned with me to see me in such a bloody condition,  and presently called up our landlord, and he as quickly called in his  neighbours, that I had a room full of people about me in a quarter  of an hour. But this had like to have been of worse consequence to me  than the other, for by this time there was great inquiring after the  person who killed a man at the tennis-court. My landlord was then  sensible of his mistake, and came to me and told me the danger I was  in, and very honestly offered to convey me to a friend's of his, where  I should be very secure; I thanked him, and suffered myself to be  carried at midnight whither he pleased. He visited me very often, till  I was well enough to walk about, which was not in less than ten days,  and then we thought fit to be gone, so we took post for Orleans. But  when I came upon the road I found myself in a new error, for my wound  opened again with riding, and I was in a worse condition than before,  being forced to take up at a little village on the road, called ----,  about ---- miles from Orleans, where there was no surgeon to be had,  but a sorry country barber, who nevertheless dressed me as well as he  could, and in about a week more I was able to walk to Orleans at three  times. Here I stayed till I was quite well, and took coach for Lyons  and so through Savoy into Italy.    I spent nearly two years' time after this bad beginning in travelling  through Italy, and to the several courts of Rome, Naples, Venice, and  Vienna.    When I came to Lyons the king was gone from thence to Grenoble to meet  the cardinal, but the queens were both at Lyons.    The French affairs seemed at this time to have but an indifferent  aspect. There was no life in anything but where the cardinal was: he  pushed on everything with extraordinary conduct, and generally with  success; he had taken Susa and Pignerol from the Duke of Savoy, and  was preparing to push the duke even out of all his dominions.    But in the meantime everywhere else things looked ill; the troops  were ill-paid, the magazines empty, the people mutinous, and a general  disorder seized the minds of the court; and the cardinal, who was the  soul of everything, desired this interview at Grenoble, in order to  put things into some better method.    This politic minister always ordered matters so, that if there was  success in anything the glory was his, but if things miscarried it was  all laid upon the king. This conduct was so much the more nice, as it  is the direct contrary to the custom in like cases, where kings assume  the glory of all the success in an action, and when a thing miscarries  make themselves easy by sacrificing their ministers and favourites  to the complaints and resentments of the people; but this accurate  refined statesman got over this point.    While we were at Lyons, and as I remember, the third day after our  coming thither, we had like to have been involved in a state broil,  without knowing where we were. It was of a Sunday in the evening, the  people of Lyons, who had been sorely oppressed in taxes, and the war  in Italy pinching their trade, began to be very tumultuous. We found  the day before the mob got together in great crowds, and talked oddly;  the king was everywhere reviled, and spoken disrespectfully of, and  the magistrates of the city either winked at, or durst not attempt to  meddle, lest they should provoke the people.    But on Sunday night, about midnight, we were waked by a prodigious  noise in the street. I jumped out of bed, and running to the window,  I saw the street as full of mob as it could hold, some armed with  muskets and halberds, marched in very good order; others in disorderly  crowds, all shouting and crying out, \"Du paix le roi,\" and the like.  One that led a great party of this rabble carried a loaf of bread upon  the top of a pike, and other lesser loaves, signifying the smallness  of their bread, occasioned by dearness.    By morning this crowd was gathered to a great height; they ran roving  over the whole city, shut up all the shops, and forced all the  people to join with them from thence. They went up to the castle, and  renewing the clamour, a strange consternation seized all the princes.    They broke open the doors of the officers, collectors of the new  taxes, and plundered their houses, and had not the persons themselves  fled in time they had been very ill-treated.    The queen-mother, as she was very much displeased to see such  consequences of the government, in whose management she had no share,  so I suppose she had the less concern upon her. However, she came into  the court of the castle and showed herself to the people, gave money  amongst them, and spoke gently to them; and by a way peculiar to  herself, and which obliged all she talked with, she pacified the mob  gradually, sent them home with promises of redress and the like; and  so appeased this tumult in two days by her prudence, which the guards  in the castle had small mind to meddle with, and if they had, would in  all probability have made the better side the worse.    There had been several seditions of the like nature in sundry other  parts of France, and the very army began to murmur, though not to  mutiny, for want of provisions.    This sedition at Lyons was not quite over when we left the place,  for, finding the city all in a broil, we considered we had no business  there, and what the consequence of a popular tumult might be we did  not see, so we prepared to be gone. We had not rid above three miles  out of the city but we were brought as prisoners of war, by a party of  mutineers, who had been abroad upon the scout, and were charged  with being messengers sent to the cardinal for forces to reduce the  citizens. With these pretences they brought us back in triumph, and  the queen-mother, being by this time grown something familiar to them,  they carried us before her.    When they inquired of us who we were, we called ourselves Scots; for  as the English were very much out of favour in France at this time,  the peace having been made not many months, and not supposed to  be very durable, because particularly displeasing to the people of  England, so the Scots were on the other extreme with the French.  Nothing was so much caressed as the Scots, and a man had no more to  do in France, if he would be well received there, than to say he was a  Scotchman.    When we came before the queen-mother she seemed to receive us with  some stiffness at first, and caused her guards to take us into  custody; but as she was a lady of most exquisite politics, she did  this to amuse the mob, and we were immediately after dismissed; and  the queen herself made a handsome excuse to us for the rudeness we had  suffered, alleging the troubles of the times; and the next morning we  had three dragoons of the guards to convoy us out of the jurisdiction  of Lyons.    I confess this little adventure gave me an aversion to popular tumults  all my life after, and if nothing else had been in the cause, would  have biassed me to espouse the king's party in England when our  popular heats carried all before it at home.    But I must say, that when I called to mind since, the address, the  management, the compliance in show, and in general the whole conduct  of the queen-mother with the mutinous people of Lyons, and compared it  with the conduct of my unhappy master the King of England, I could not  but see that the queen understood much better than King Charles the  management of politics and the clamours of the people.    Had this princess been at the helm in England, she would have  prevented all the calamities of the Civil War here, and yet not have  parted with what that good prince yielded in order to peace neither.  She would have yielded gradually, and then gained upon them gradually;  she would have managed them to the point she had designed them, as she  did all parties in France; and none could effectually subject her but  the very man she had raised to be her principal support--I mean the  cardinal.    We went from hence to Grenoble, and arrived there the same day that  the king and the cardinal with the whole court went out to view a body  of 6000 Swiss foot, which the cardinal had wheedled the cantons to  grant to the king to help to ruin their neighbour the Duke of Savoy.    The troops were exceeding fine, well-accoutred, brave, clean-limbed, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1226"],[0,"The Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Volume 10 (#5)"],[1,"to many of  the well-trained readers of the JOURNAL, and so, in a way, it does to me,  but it may be interesting as the work of a layman rather than a trained  physician. I have not used the word \"sexual\" in this paper, but the reader  can judge for himself if the impulses would come under this heading, either  in the more narrow use of the term or in the broader meaning which Freud has  given it.  For myself, I see no possible objection in employing the word  \"sexual\" in this connection.    The uncertain parts of the dream are as interesting in a way as the others.  Why did I not know with whom I was riding, and why were the persons with  whom I talked more certain in their identity? Here, of course, is the place  where it would be easy to find a repression if such existed and--I  believe--if it did not exist. Whether there is such a repression there or  not I do not know, but I see no necessity for considering that there is one  there just because there is a dim place in the dream.  In the study which I  made of dreams a year or so ago, I became convinced that there is a  principle of dream-making which has not been noticed. I will throw out a  suggestion here in the hope that some one will study it further, but will  give no elaborate discussion in this paper.  Briefly, it is that only those  things appear in a dream which are necessary to express the meaning of the  dream. A few illustrations may make this clear.  Every one has noticed the  rarity with which colors and sunshine appear in dreams; I have found,  however, that colors and sunshine always appear if there is any necessity  for their doing so.  Some one dreams of a melon and looks to see if it is  ripe; he sees the red color; he dreams of a stream which he thinks is a  sewer and smells it to see if it gives off an odor and finds that it does;  he dreams of pulling his fishing line to see if there is a fish on it and  senses the pull of the fish; I have examples in abundance which go to  indicate that taste, smell, tactual, kinaesthetic, color sensation or any  other kind will appear in a dream when they are called for to complete the  meaning of the dream, but they are not common because they are very rarely  needed. Even in waking life we rarely think in these terms. If this little  principle prove true, it would be easy to understand why certain parts of a  dream are dim without going to the doubtful process of positing a  repression. The persons in the dream were not recognized simply because  there was no need for them to be; the dream expressed the pertinent meaning  just as well without them as with them. They were observed just as many of  us would observe the occupants of a street car in waking life; we could  possibly not describe, even partly, any one of the occupants of the car  which we used on our way to the office or home.    Before leaving this nightmare, I want to call attention again to the somatic  elements.  I was lying on my back and in a cramped position, the air was  closer than usual, and my circulation was naturally deranged. When I awoke I  was strongly inclined to give the physical elements a large amount of the  responsibility for the dream, and I have not found occasion to change my  mind in this matter. I think that even the inability to jump through the  window in the dream was caused by the weak and exhausted state of my body,  due to the poor circulation and cramped position.        ANALYSIS OF A SINGLE DREAM AS A MEANS OF UNEARTHING THE GENESIS OF  PSYCHOPATHIC AFFECTIONS    BY MEYER SOLOMON, MD., CHICAGO    THOSE; of us who have devoted a certain amount of our time and energy to the  study of dreams have early come to realize the value of a dream as a  starting-point in the analysis of certain mental states, particularly those  of an abnormal character.    Frequently, in the hopeless tangle of symptoms, complaints and disconnected  facts in the history as originally obtained, especially in old-standing  cases, one does not really know just where to begin, what to start with in  the first efforts to struggle with the problem of the ultimate genesis and  evolution of the condition which is presented to him at the particular  moment. Of course, by a careful review of the patient's past life history,  gone over by persistent questioning and cross-examination, one can begin  with the family history and step by step trace the history of the patient  from earliest childhood or infancy through the various stages and phases of  activity and development up to the very moment of examination.  This may at  times appear quite dull, quite uninteresting and entirely unnecessary to  certain patients. For this reason and also for many other reasons, which I  shall not enumerate at this point it is at times well to resort to dream  analysis. And in analyzing dreams it is well to remember a fact, with which  I believe all psychoanalysts will agree, namely, that by a most thorough and  far-reaching analysis of a SINGLE DREAM, we can, by following out to the  ultimate ends the various clues which are given us and the various by-paths  which offer themselves to us in the course of the analysis--we can, I  repeat, should we be so inclined, root up the entire life history of the  dreamer. This may not be necessary in all cases.  But, at any rate, if we  desired so to do for scientific purposes, we could arrive at such results.  In such an analysis we would, of course, first take up, individually, every  portion and every element of every portion of the dream, and by means of  each such lesser or greater element of the dream, we could arrive at a mass  of material, a wealth of information concerning the past experiential,  emotional, mental and moral life of the individual whose dream we were at  the moment analyzing. In fact, one could ferret out the full life history in  great detail, thus obtaining a complete autobiography leading far down into  the depths of the dreamer's mental life and into the inner world of his own.  With the material so obtained one could truly reconstruct the complete life  history, piecemeal, until the wonderful and inspiring structure of the  mental world of the dreamer would be reared, reaching far back to early  childhood and perhaps even to infancy, extending so far forward as to give  us a prophecy, based on the dreamer's dynamic trends and emotional trends  and leanings, of the probable future, stretching forth its tentacles in all  directions, and, uncovering the psychic underworld in its every part,  holding up before our eyes the naked mind, in its length, its breadth and  its thickness.    I am not referring here particularly to the employment of the method of  hypnosis, especially as practiced by Prince, or to Freud's so-called free  association (which is frequently really forced association) or Jung's word  association methods. I am speaking only of analysis of the dream by ordinary  conversation and introspection, in the normal waking state. Of course, were  the latter method supplemented by these other methods, the results would be  so much the more complete and far-reaching. I may mention, specifically,  that the employment of Freud's free association method would be helpful here  in gathering information because, when employing this method, one  practically forces the one being analyzed to think by analogy and by  comparison, insisting that he tell you what a certain word or name or scene  or experience or what not reminds him of, what it resembles, what he can  compare it to, no matter how remote its connection, no matter how unrelated,  how far-fetched or how silly the association may appear in his own eyes--in  other words, we demand that he co-operate by suspending critical selection  and judgment. Although, as I say, Freud's, Jung's, Prince's and other  methods may be advantageously employed, still, it seems to me, although I  cannot yet state this in final or positive terms, that, at least in most  cases, such an unravelment and resurrection of the past life history can be  obtained by an analysis of the dream conducted in the ordinary, waking  state, and the usual conversational mode of history-taking and daily oral  intercourse.    It needs no repetition or elaboration to convince psychoanalysts (I use the  term \"psychoanalyst\" in the broad, unrestricted sense of the word, including  the supporters of all possible schools or standpoints or methods in  psychoanalysis or mental analysis, and not limiting it to Freud's  psychoanalysis) of the essential and fundamental truth of this statement. I  shall, therefore, not unnecessarily lengthen this paper by endeavoring to  bring forth complete evidence of the truth of this assertion.    As a matter of fact, this conclusion or generalization applies not alone to  dreams but to any single element in the objective or subjective world which  may be seized upon as the initial stimulus and from which, as a  starting-point, association of ideas, in ordinary conversation or aided by  any of the more or less experimental or artificial but valuable methods  heretofore mentioned, may be begun and continued ad libitum or even ad  infinitum, under the tactful guidance and judgment of the investigator.  For  example, if I may be permitted to tread upon the dangerous path of  near-sensationalism or extremism, I may mention that were I to take even so  common, so widely used, and so relatively insignificant a word as the  definite article \"the\" as the initial stimulus, and have one of my fellowmen  or fellow-women (whose full co-operation, it is assumed, I have previously  obtained) give me one or more free or random word associations, and  thereafter, with these newly acquired elements, continued to forge my way  into the thickly wooded and unexplored recesses of the unknown and  mysterious forest of the mind, I doubt not but that I should achieve the  same results as if I had started upon my journey with a dream. If this be  true, and I firmly"]]]
