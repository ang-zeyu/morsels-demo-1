[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12928"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 1 (#5)"],[1," of all the waters above-mentioned,  been to the north-west, it was obvious that such a range must have been  the dividing ridge or spine connecting the eastern and western parts of  Australia, and which, when once investigated was likely to be the key to  the discovery of all the rivers on each side, and to the other  subordinate features of this great island.    Thus, the most direct and practical plan for seeking the river, was  perfectly consistent with my views of general exploration.    PREPARATION FOR THE SURVEY.    In the selection of men to compose an exploring party, and in collecting  the articles of equipment, provisions, and means of transport, my  department afforded various facilities. This aid was the more necessary  in my case, because the other duties of my office, prevented me from  devoting much attention personally, to the preparations for such a  journey.    From the known level character of the interior, I considered that the  light drays or carts used by the surveyors might easily pass, and I  therefore preferred them to packhorses, being also a more convenient  means of conveyance; I availed myself likewise of such men, carts,  bullocks, and horses, as were disposable in the survey department at the  time. The new Governor was expected in the course of a few months, and I  was therefore desirous to set out as soon as possible, that I might  return before his arrival.    After several weeks of anxious preparation, I had the satisfaction to  find that every contingency was, as far as possible, provided for in my  department. Each officer, whether employed in the survey of the different  parts of the colony, or the measurement of farms, was also fully  instructed respecting his duties during my contemplated absence. In the  correspondence with the office at Sydney, which amounted annually to  about 2000 letters, none remained unanswered; and my last cares were to  leave, in the hands of an engraver, a map of the colony, that the past  labours of the department might be permanently secured to the public,  whatever might be our fate in the interior.    DEPARTURE FROM SYDNEY.    Little time remained for me to look at the sextants, theodolite, and  other instruments necessary for the exploratory journey; I collected in  haste a few articles of personal equipment, and having as well as I  could, under the circumstances, set my house in order, I bade adieu to my  family, and left Sydney at noon, on Thursday, the 24th day of November,  1831, being accompanied for some miles by my friend Colonel Snodgrass.    It was not until then, that my mind was sufficiently relieved from  considering the details of my department, to enable me to direct my  thoughts to the undiscovered country. I had yet to traverse 300 miles,  for to that distance from Sydney the flocks of the colonists extended,  before I could reach the vast untrodden soil, the exploration of which  was the object of my mission. I felt the ardour of my early youth, when I  first sought distinction in the crowded camp and battlefield, revive, as  I gave loose to my reflections and considered the nature of the  enterprise. But, in comparing the feelings I then experienced with those  which excited my youthful ambition, it seemed that even war and victory,  with all their glory, were far less alluring than the pursuit of  researches such as these; the objects of which were to spread the light  of civilisation over a portion of the globe yet unknown, though rich,  perhaps, in the luxuriance of uncultivated nature, and where science  might accomplish new and unthought-of discoveries; while intelligent man  would find a region teeming with useful vegetation, abounding with  rivers, hills, and valleys, and waiting only for his enterprising spirit  and improving hand to turn to account the native bounty of the soil.    A GARDEN.    My first day's journey, terminated near Parramatta, at the residence of  Mr. John Macarthur. I was received by that gentleman with his usual  hospitality, and although not in the enjoyment of the best health, he  insisted on accompanying me over his extensive and beautiful garden,  where he pointed out to my attention, the first olive-tree ever planted  in Australia. Here I also saw the cork-tree in full luxuriance--the caper  plant growing amidst rocks--the English oak--the  horse-chestnut--broom--magnificent mulberry trees of thirty-five years'  growth, umbrageous and green. Beds of roses, in great variety, were  spread around, and filled the air with fragrance, while the climbing  species of that beautiful flower was equally pleasing to the eye. I  observed convict Greeks (Pirates.)--acti fatis--at work in that garden of  the antipodes, training the vines to trellises, made after the fashion of  those in the Peloponnesus. The state of the orange-trees, flourishing in  the form of cones sixteen feet high, and loaded with fruit, was very  remarkable, but they had risen from the roots of former trees, which,  having been reduced to bare poles by a drought of three years' duration,  had been cut off, and were now succeeded by these vigorous products of  more genial seasons. Mr. Macarthur assured me, that by adopting this  plan, many fruit-trees, after suffering from the effects of  long-continued drought, might be renovated successfully. The want of  moisture in the climate of Australia, may occasionally compel the  gardener to resort to such extreme measures for the preservation of his  trees: but the orange has hitherto yielded a very profitable and constant  return to those, who have attended to its cultivation in this colony. The  luxuriant growth of the apple and pear, in a climate so dry and warm, is  a remarkable fact; and when we consider the exuberance of the vine in the  few spots, where it has as yet been planted; we are justified in  anticipating from the variety of aspect and unbroken soil in these  southern regions, that many a curious or luxurious wine, still unknown,  may in time be produced there.    But the garden, to him who seeks a home in distant colonies, must ever be  an object of peculiar interest; for there, while cultivating the trees,  fruits and flowers of his native land, the recollection of early days,  and of the country of his birth is awakened by the vivid colours of the  simple flower which his industry has reared, and which he knows to be a  native of the soil to which he himself owes his existence.    COUNTRY BETWEEN SYDNEY AND THE HAWKESBURY.    At an early hour on the following morning, I took leave of my kind host,  and also of my friend Mr. Dunlop, to whose scientific assistance in  preparing for this journey I feel much indebted. Mr. James Macarthur  accompanied me a few miles on the road, when we parted with regret; and I  set forth on my journey in the direction of the Hawkesbury, along the  road leading to the ferry, across that river at Wiseman's. I should here  observe, that I had previously arranged that the exploring party which,  being slower in its movements, had been despatched two weeks before,  should await my arrival on Foy Brook, beyond the river Hunter, where I  expected to meet Mr. White also, the assistant surveyor, whom I had  selected to accompany me on this expedition.    My ride, on that day, was along a ridge, which extended upwards of fifty  miles, through a succession of deep ravines, where no objects met the eye  except barren sandstone rocks, and stunted trees. With the banksia and  xanthorrhoea always in sight, the idea of hopeless sterility is ever  present to the mind, for these productions, in sandy soils at least, grow  only where nothing else can vegetate. The horizon is flat, affording no  relief to the eye from the dreary and inhospitable scene, which these  solitudes present; and which extends over a great portion of the country,  uninhabitable even by the aborigines. Yet here the patient labours of the  surveyor have opened a road, although the stream of population must be  confined to it, since it cannot spread over a region so utterly  unprofitable and worthless.    It is not until the traveller has completed a journey of fifty miles,  that he enjoys the sight, doubly cheering after crossing such a desert,  of green, cultivated fields, and the dwellings of man. The broad waters  of the Hawkesbury then come unexpectedly in view, flowing in the deepest,  and apparently most inaccessible of these rock-bound valleys. He here  soon discovers a practical proof of the advantages of convict labour to  the inhabitants of such a country, in the facility with which he descends  by a road cut in the rock, to the comfortable inn near the ferry.    COUNTRY BEYOND THE HAWKESBURY.    Early next morning my ride was resumed, after crossing the river in the  ferry-boat, where the width is 280 yards. The Hawkesbury is here the  boundary between the counties of Cumberland and Northumberland. The  scenery is fine on those broad and placid waters, sheltered by  overhanging cliffs, 600 feet in height. The river appears smooth as a  mirror, and affords access by boats and small vessels, to the little  sheltered cots and farms, which now enliven the margin. These patches are  of no great extent, and occur alternately on each bank of this noble  stream, comprising farms of from thirty to a hundred acres.    The necessity for a permanent land communication, between the seat of  government and the northern part of the colony was obvious, and, indeed,  a road in that direction had been the subject of petitions from the  settlers to Sir Thomas Brisbane, under whose auspices the track across  the mountain beyond the Hawkesbury, was first discovered and surveyed by  Mr. Finch. This track, with some slight alterations, was found, on a more  general survey, to be the most favourable line for a cart-road in that  direction, which the country afforded; and it had been opened but a short  time, when I thus proceeded along it, accompanied by Mr. Simpson, the  assistant-surveyor,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12929"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 1 (#5)"],[1,"e: it has  antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two  claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which  could have been selected.*    [* Had I permitted myself any innovation upon the original term, it would  have been to convert it into AUSTRALIA; as being more agreeable to the  ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the  earth.]    In dividing New South Wales from New Holland, I have been guided by the  British patent to the first governor of the new colony, at Port Jackson.  In this patent, a meridian, nearly corresponding to the ancient line of  separation, between New Holland and Terra Australis, has been made the  western limit of New South Wales; and is fixed at the longitude of 135 deg.  east, from the meridian of Greenwich. From hence, the British territory  extends eastward, to the islands of the _Pacific_, or _Great Ocean_: its  northern limit is at _Cape York_; and the extremity of the southern _Van  Diemen's Land_, is its opposite boundary.    The various discoveries which had been made upon the coasts of Terra  Australis, antecedently to the present voyage, are of dates as widely  distant, as are the degrees of confidence to which they are respectively  entitled; the accounts, also, lie scattered through various books in  different languages; and many are still in manuscript. It has, therefore,  been judged, that a succinct history of these discoveries would be  acceptable to the public; and would form an appropriate introduction to a  voyage, whose principal object was to complete what they had left  unfinished. Such a history will not only, it is hoped, be found  interesting, but, from the occasions it will furnish to point out what  remained to be done at the beginning of the nineteenth century, will  satisfy a question which may be asked: Why it should have been thought  necessary to send another expedition to explore the coasts of a country,  concerning which it has been said, near thirty years ago--\"It is no  longer a doubt, that we have now a full knowledge of the whole  circumference of this vast body of land, this fifth part of the world.\" *  An expression, which the learned writer could have intended to apply only  to the general extent of the new continent, and not to the particular  formation of every part of the coasts; since the chart, which accompanies  the voyage of which he was writing the introduction, represents much of  the south coast, as being totally unknown.    [* _Cook's third Voyage_, Introduction. p. xv.]    In tracing a historical sketch of the previous discoveries, I shall not  dwell upon such as depend upon conjecture and probability, but come  speedily to those, for which there are authentic documents. In this  latter, and solely important, class, the articles extracted from voyages,  which are in the hands of the public, will be abridged to their leading  heads; and the reader referred, for the details, to the original works;  but in such articles as have either not appeared before, or but very  imperfectly, in an English dress, as also in those extracted from  unpublished manuscripts, a wider range will be taken: in these, so far as  the documents go, on the one hand, and the limits of an introduction can  allow, on the other, no interesting fact will be omitted.    Conformably to this plan, no attempt will be made to investigate the  claims of the _Chinese_ to the earliest knowledge of Terra Australis;  which some, from the chart of _Marco Polo_, have thought they possessed.  Nor yet will much be said upon the plea advanced by the Abbe PREVOST,*  and after him by the President DEBROSSES,** in favour of _Paulmier de  Gonneville_, a French captain; for whom they claim the honour of having  discovered Terra Australis, in 1504. It is evident from the proofs they  adduce, that it was not to any part of this country, but to Madagascar,  that Gonneville was driven; and from whence he brought his prince  Essomeric, to Normandy.    [* _Histoire generale des Voyages_. Tome XVI. (a la Haye) p. 7-14.]    [** _Histoire des Navigations aux Terres Australes_. Tome I. p. 102-120.]    Within these few years, however, two curious manuscript charts have been  brought to light; which have favoured an opinion, that Terra Australis  had really been visited by Europeans, nearly a century before any  authentic accounts speak of its discovery. One of these charts is in  French, without date; and from its almost exact similitude, is probably  either the original, or a copy of the other, which is in English; and  bears, with the date 1542, a dedication to the KING OF ENGLAND.* In it,  an extensive country is marked to the southward of the Moluccas, under  the name of GREAT JAVA; which agrees nearer with the position and extent  of Terra Australis, than with any other land; and the direction given to  some parts of the coast, approaches too near to the truth, for the whole  to have been marked from conjecture alone. But, combining this with the  exaggerated extent of Great Java in a southern direction, and the animals  and houses painted upon the shores, such as have not been any where seen  in Terra Australis, it should appear to have been partly formed from  vague information, collected, probably, by the early Portuguese  navigators, from the eastern nations; and that conjecture has done the  rest. It may, at the same time, be admitted, that a part of the west and  north-west coasts, where the coincidence of form is most striking, might  have been seen by the Portuguese themselves, before the year 1540, in  their voyages to, and from, India.    [* A more particular account of these charts, now in the _British  Museum_, will be found in Captain Burney's \"_History of Discoveries in  the South Sea_.\" Vol. I. p. 379-383. An opinion is there expressed  concerning the early discoveries in these regions, which is entitled to  respectful attention.]    But quitting those claims to original discovery, in which conjecture  bears so large a share, we come to such as are supported by undeniable  documents. Before entering upon these, it is proper to premise, that,  instead of following precisely the order of time, these discoveries will  be classed under the heads of the different coasts upon which they were  made: an arrangement which will obviate the confusion that would arise  from being carried back from one coast to another, as must, of necessity,  be the case, were the chronological order to be strictly followed.    The discoveries made in Terra Australis, _prior to the Investigator's  voyage_, will, therefore, be divided into four Sections, under the  following heads: 1. The NORTH COAST; 2. The WESTERN COASTS; 3. The SOUTH  COAST; and, 4. The EAST COAST with VAN DIEMEN'S LAND. But the articles in  the fourth Section, being numerous and more extensive, will be divided  into two parts: PART I. will contain the early discoveries, and such of  the later, as were made independently of the British colony in New South  Wales; and PART II. those which were made in vessels sent from that  colony; and which may be considered as a consequence of its  establishment.    PRIOR DISCOVERIES IN TERRA AUSTRALIS.    SECTION I.    NORTH COAST.    Preliminary Remarks:  Discoveries of the Duyfhen; of  Torres;  Carstens;  Pool;  Pietersen;  Tasman; and of  three Dutch vessels.  Of Cook;  M'Cluer;  Bligh;  Edwards;  Bligh and Portlock; and  Bampton and Alt.  Conclusive Remarks.    PRELIMINARY REMARKS    The late Hydrographer to the Admiralty, ALEXANDER DALRYMPLE, Esq., in his  curious _Collection concerning_ PAPUA, published, with a translation, a  paper which furnishes more regular and authentic accounts of the early  Dutch discoveries in the East, than any thing with which the public was  before acquainted. This interesting paper was procured by the Right Hon.  Sir Joseph Banks; and is a copy of the instructions to commodore ABEL  JANSZ TASMAN, for his _second_ voyage of discovery: It is dated January  29, 1644, from the _Castle of Batavia_, and signed by the  governor-general ANTONIO VAN DIEMEN, and by _Vander Lyn_, _Maatsuyker_,  _Schouten_, and _Sweers_, members of the council. The instructions are  prefaced with a recital, in chronological order, of the previous  discoveries of the Dutch, whether made from accident or design, in NOVA  GUINEA, and the _Great_ SOUTH LAND; and from this account, combined with  a passage from Saris,* it appears, that--    THE DUYFHEN. 1606.    On the 18th of November 1605, the Dutch yacht, the _Duyfhen_, was  dispatched from Bantam to explore the islands of New Guinea; and that she  sailed along, what was thought to be, the west side of that country, to  133/4 deg. of south latitude. \"This extensive country was found, for the  greatest part, desert; but, in some places, inhabited by wild, cruel,  black savages; by whom some of the crew were murdered. For which reason  they could not learn anything of the land, or waters, as had been desired  of them; and, from want of provisions and other necessaries, they were  obliged to leave the discovery unfinished: The furthest point of the  land, in their map, was called Cape KEER-WEER,\" or Turn-again.    (ATLAS, Pl. I.)    The course of the Duyfhen, from New Guinea, was southward, along the  islands on the west side of Torres' Strait, to that part of Terra  Australis, a little to the west and south of Cape York; but all these  lands were thought to be connected, and to form the west coast of New  Guinea. Thus, without being conscious of it, the commander of the Duyfhen  made the first authenticated discovery of any part of the great South  Land, about the month of March 1606; for it appears, that he had returned  to Banda in, or before, the beginning of June, of that year.    TORRES 1606    LUIS VAES DE TORRES, a Spanish navigator, was the next person who saw  Terra Australis; and it is remarkable, that it was near the same place,  and in the same year;"]]]
