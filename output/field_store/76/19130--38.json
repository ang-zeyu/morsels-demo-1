That was the way things always went at  their house. Tom was allowed to upset the place from one end to the  other without ever having to pick up his things; Betty was never asked  to do any housework, and her mother left the Saturday dinner dishes  standing and began to sweep in the afternoon and then was unable to  finish. Migwan was just about to suggest a search for the errant Betty,  when she remembered the \"Give Service\" part of the Camp Fire Law. She  rose cheerfully and took the broom from her mother's hand.    \"Lie down a while, mother,\" she said, plumping up the pillows on the  couch. Mrs. Gardiner sank down gratefully and Migwan put away her story  and went at the sweeping. She soon turned it into a game in which she  was a good fairy fighting the hosts of the goblin Dust, and must have  them completely vanquished by four o'clock, or her magic wand, which had  for the time being taken the shape of a broom, would vanish and leave  her weaponless. Needless to say, she was in complete possession of the  field when the clock struck the charmed hour. Being then out of the mood  to continue her writing, she passed on into the kitchen and attacked the  Fortress of Dishes, which she razed to the ground completely, leaving  her banner, in the form of the dish towel, flying over the spot.    \"What are you planning for supper?\" she asked her mother, looking into  the sitting room to see how she was feeling.    \"Oh, dear, I don't know,\" said Mrs. Gardiner. \"I hadn't given it a  thought. I don't believe there's anything left from dinner. Run down to  the store, will you, and get a couple of porterhouse steaks, there's a  dear. And stop at the baker's as you come by and get us each a cream  puff for dessert. Betty is so fond of them.\" Migwan returned to the  kitchen and got her mother's pocketbook. There was just twenty-five  cents in it. Migwan realized with a shock that it would not pay for what  her mother wanted, and her sensitive nature shrank from asking to have  things charged.    \"I won't buy the cream puffs,\" she decided. \"I wonder if there is  anything in the house I could make into a dessert?\" Search revealed  nothing but a bag of prunes, which had been on the shelf for months, and  were as dry as a bone. They did not appeal to Migwan in the least, but  there was nothing else in evidence. \"I might make prune whip,\" she  thought rather doubtfully. \"They're pretty hard, but I can soak them.  I'll need the oven to make prune whip, so I will bake the potatoes too.\"  She hunted around for the potatoes and finally found them in a small  paper bag. \"Buying potatoes two quarts at a time must be rather  expensive,\" she reflected. She put the prunes to soak and the potatoes  in the oven and went down to the store. \"How much is porterhouse steak?\"  she asked before she had the butcher cut any off.    \"Twenty-eight cents a pound,\" answered the man behind the counter.  Migwan gave a little gasp. The money she had would not even buy a pound.    \"How much is round steak?\" she inquired.    \"Twenty-two,\" came the reply.    \"Give me twenty-five cents' worth,\" she said. It did not look  particularly tender and Migwan thought distressedly how her mother would  complain when she found round steak instead of porterhouse. \"But there  is no help for it,\" she said to herself grimly, \"beggars cannot be  choosers.\" She stopped on the way home to get the recipe for prune whip  from Sahwah. Sahwah was not at home, but her mother gave Migwan the  recipe and added many directions as to the proper mixing of the  ingredients. \"Is--is there any way of making tough round steak tender?\"  she asked timidly, just a little ashamed to admit that they had to eat  round steak.    \"There certainly is,\" answered Mrs. Brewster. \"You just pound all the  flour into it that it will take up. I hardly ever buy porterhouse steaks  any more since I learned that trick. I am having some to-night. It is  one of our favorite dishes here. Round steak prepared in this way is  known in the restaurants as 'Dutch steak,' and commands a high price.\"  Considerably cheered by this last intelligence, Migwan sped home and got  her prune dessert into the oven and then set to work transforming the  tough steak into a tender morsel.    \"What kind of meat is this?\" asked her mother when they had taken their  places at the table.    \"Guess,\" said Migwan.    \"It tastes like tenderloin,\" said her mother.    \"Guess again,\" said Migwan gleefully; \"it's round steak.\"    \"The butcher must be buying better meat than usual, then,\" said Mrs.  Gardiner. \"I never got such round steak as this out here before.\"    \"And you never will, either,\" said Migwan, swelling with pride, \"if you  leave it to the butcher,\" and she told how she had treated the steak to  produce the present result.    \"I never heard of that before,\" said her mother, amazed at this simple  culinary trick.    Next the prune whip was brought on and pronounced good by every one and  \"bully\" by Tom, who ate his in great spoonfuls. \"I see I'll have to let  you get the meals after this,\" said Mrs. Gardiner to Migwan. \"You have a  knack of putting things together, which I have not.\"    Migwan was too tired to write any more that night after the dishes were  done, but she was entirely light-hearted as she wove into her bead band  the symbols of that day's achievements--a broom and a frying pan. She  had learned something that afternoon besides how to prepare beefsteak.  She had waked up to the careless fashion in which the house was being  run, and her head was full of plans for cutting down expenses. Monday  afternoon, on her way home from school, Migwan saw a farmer's wagon  standing in front of the Brewsters' home, and Mrs. Brewster stood at the  curb, buying her winter supply of potatoes.    \"Have you put your potatoes in yet?\" she asked as Migwan came along.    Migwan stopped. \"I don't believe we ever bought them in large  quantities,\" she answered. \"How much are they a bushel?\"    \"Sixty-five cents,\" said the farmer. Migwan made a quick mental  calculation. At the rate they had been buying potatoes in two-quart lots  they had been paying a dollar and seventy-five cents a bushel. Migwan  came to a sudden decision.    \"Are they all good?\" she asked Mrs. Brewster.    \"They have always been in the past years,\" answered Sahwah's mother,  \"and I have bought my potatoes from this man for the last six winters.\"    \"How many would it take for a family of four?\" asked Migwan.    \"About five bushels,\" answered Mrs. Brewster.    \"All right,\" said Migwan to the man; \"bring five bushels over to this  address.\" The potatoes were duly deposited in the Gardiner cellar,  without asking the advice of Mrs. Gardiner, which was the only safe way  of getting things done, for had she been consulted she would surely have  wanted to wait a while, and then would have kept putting it off until it  was too late. It was the same way with flour and sugar. Migwan found  that her mother had been buying these in small quantities at an  exorbitant price, and calmly took matters into her own hands, ordering a  whole barrel of flour, because there was more in a barrel even than in  four sacks. A certain large store was offering a liberal discount that  week on fifty pounds of sugar, and Migwan took advantage of this sale  also.    Then she had a terrified counting up. Those three items, potatoes, flour  and sugar, had used up every cent of that week's income, leaving nothing  at all for running expenses. All other supplies would have to be bought  on credit. Migwan made a careful estimate of the necessary expenses for  the coming week, and pare down as she might, the sum was nearly fifteen  dollars. The loss of the rent money was making itself keenly felt.  \"Mother,\" she said quietly, looking up from her account book, \"we can't  live on fifty-five dollars a month. We must rent the house again  immediately.\"    Mrs. Gardiner made a gesture of despair. \"The sign has been up nearly a  month, and if people don't make inquiries I can't help it.\"    \"Have you been in the house since the last people moved out?\" asked  Migwan.    \"No,\" said Mrs. Gardiner; \"what good would that do? I haven't the time  to go all the way over to the East Side to look at that old house.  People know it's for rent, and if they want it they'll take it without  my sitting over there waiting for them.\"    Nevertheless, Migwan made the long trip the very next day after school  to look at the property. \"It's no wonder no one has been making  inquiries for it,\" she said when she returned. \"The 'For Rent' sign was  gone and I found it later when I was going back up the street. Some boys  had used it to make the end piece of a wagon. Then, the plumbing is bad  and the cellar is flooded, and the water will not run off in the kitchen  sink. These must have been the repairs the old tenants wanted made when  you told them you had no money to fix the house, and so they moved. I  don't blame them at all.    \"Then, there is another thing I thought of when I was looking through  the rooms. You know that big unfinished space over the kitchen? Well, I  thought, why can't we make a furnished room of that? There is space  enough to build a large room and a bathroom, for part of it is just  above the bathroom downstairs. A large furnished room with a private  bath would bring in ten dollars a month. It is just at the head of the  back stairs and the side door where the back stairs connect with the  cellar way could be used as a private entrance, so the tenants of the  house would not be disturbed in the least. It would cost over a hundred  dollars to do it, most likely, but we could borrow the money"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11734"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 460, October 25, 1884 (#5)"],[1,"occur  to one or more of the cylinders or wheels, the remaining ones can be run  until a favorable opportunity arrives to repair the damage. A small  separate double cylinder diagonal engine is fitted to this machine, the  speed of which can be adjusted for any texture of cloth, and being of the  design it is, will start at once on steam being turned one. The machine  cylinders are rolled by a special machine for that purpose, and are  perfectly true on the face. Their insides are fitted with patent buckets,  which remove all the condensed water. In the machine exhibited, which is  designed for the bleaching, washing, chloring, and dyeing, the cloth is  supported by hollow metallic cylinders perforated with holes and corrugated  to allow the liquor used to pass freely through as much of the cloth as  possible; the open ends of the cylinders are so arranged that nearly all of  their area is open to the action of the pump. The liquor, which is drawn  through the cloth into the inside of the cylinders by the centrifugal  pumps, is discharged back into the cistern by a specially constructed  discharge pipe, so devised that the liquor, which is sent into it with  great force by the pump, is diverted so as to pour straight down in order  to prevent any eddies which could cause the cloth to wander from its  course. The cloth is supported to and from the cylinders by flat perforated  plates in such a manner that the force of the liquor cannot bag or displace  the threads of the cloth, and by this means also the liquor has a further  tendency to penetrate the fibers of the cloth. Means are provided for  readily and expeditiously cleansing the entire machine. The next machine  which we have to notice in this exhibit is Farmer's patent marking and  measuring machine, the purpose of which is to stamp on the cloths the  lengths of the same at regular distances. It is very desirable that drapers  should have some simple means of discovering at a glance what amount of  material they have in stock without the necessity of unrolling their cloth  to measure it, and this machine seems to perfectly meet the demands of the  case. The arrangement for effecting the printing and inking is shown in our  engraving at A. It is contained within a small disk, which can be moved at  will, so that it can be adapted to various widths of cloth or other  material. A measuring roller runs beside the printing disk, and on this is  stamped the required figures by a simple contrivance at the desired  distances, say every five yards. The types are linked together into a  roller chain which is carried by the disk, A, and they ink themselves  automatically from a flannel pad. The machine works in this way: The end of  the piece to be measured is brought down until it touches the surface of  the table, the marker is turned to zero, and also the finger of the dial on  the end of the measuring roller. The machine is then started, and the  lengths are printed at the required distances until it becomes necessary to  cut out the first piecing or joint in the fabric. The dial registers the  total length of the piece.           *       *       *       *       *          ENDLESS ROPE HAULAGE.      In the North of England Report, the endless rope systems are classified as  No. 1 and No 2 systems. No. 1, which has the rope under the tubs, is said  to be in operation in the Midland counties. To give motion to the rope a  single wheel is used, and friction for driving the rope is supplied either  by clip pulleys or by taking the rope over several wheels. The diagram  shows an arrangement for a tightening arrangement. One driving wheel is  used, says _The Colliery Guardian_, and the rope is kept constantly tight  by passing it round a pulley fixed upon a tram to which a heavy weight is  attached. Either one or two lines of rails are used. When a single line is  adopted the rope works backward and forward, only one part being on the  wagon way and the other running by the side of the way. When two lines are  used the ropes move always in one direction, the full tubs coming out on  one line and the empties going in on the other. The rope passes under the  tubs, and the connection is made by means of a clamp or by sockets in the  rope, to which the set is attached by a short chain. The rope runs at a  moderately high speed.    [Illustration: TIGHTENING ARRANGEMENT--ENDLESS ROPE HAULAGE.]    No. 2 system was peculiar to Wigan. A double line of rails is always used.  The rope rests upon the tubs, which are attached to the rope either singly  or in sets varying in number from two to twelve. The other engraving shows  a mode of connection between the tubs and the rope by a rope loop as shown.    [Illustration: ATTACHMENT TO ENDLESS ROPE \"OVER.\"]    The tubs are placed at a regular distance apart, and the rope works slowly.  Motion is given to the rope by large driving pulleys, and friction is  obtained by taking the rope several times round the driving pulley.           *       *       *       *       *          A RELIABLE WATER FILTER.      Opinions are so firmly fixed at present that water is capable of carrying  the germs of disease that, in cases of epidemics, the recommendation is  made to drink natural mineral waters, or to boil ordinary water. This is a  wise measure, assuredly; but mineral waters are expensive, and, moreover,  many persons cannot get used to them. As for boiled water, that is a  beverage which has no longer a normal composition; a portion of its salts  has become precipitated, and its dissolved gases have been given off. In  spite of the aeration that it is afterward made to undergo, it preserves an  insipid taste, and I believe that it is not very digestible. I have  thought, then, that it would be important, from a hygienic standpoint, to  have a filter that should effectually rid water of all the microbes or  germs that it contains, while at the same time preserving the salts or  gases that it holds in solution. I have reached such a result, and,  although it is always delicate to speak of things that one has himself  done, I think the question is too important to allow me to hold back my  opinion in regard to the apparatus. It is a question of general hygiene  before which my own personality must disappear completely.    In Mr. Pasteur's laboratory, we filter the liquids in which microbes have  been cultivated, so as to separate them from the medium in which they  exist. For this purpose we employ a small unglazed porcelain tube that we  have had especially constructed therefor. The liquid traverses the porous  sides of this under the influence of atmospheric pressure, since we cause a  vacuum around the tube by means of an air-pump. We collect in this way,  after several hours, a few cubic inches of a liquid which is absolutely  pure, since animals may be inoculated with it without danger to them, while  the smallest quantity of the same liquid, when not filtered, infallibly  causes death.    This is the process that I have applied to the filtration of water. I have  introduced into it merely such modifications as are necessary to render the  apparatus entirely practical. My apparatus consists of an unglazed  porcelain tube inverted upon a ring of enameled porcelain, forming a part  thereof, and provided with an aperture for the outflow of the liquid. This  tube is placed within a metallic one, which is directly attached to a cock  that is soldered to the service pipe. A nut at the base that can be  maneuvered by hand permits, through the intermedium of a rubber washer  resting upon the enameled ring, of the tube being hermetically closed.    Under these circumstances, when the cock is turned on, the water fills the  space between the two tubes and slowly filters, under the influence of  pressure, through the sides of the porous one, and is freed from all solid  matter, including the microbes and germs, that it contains. It flows out  thoroughly purified, through the lower aperture, into a vessel placed there  to receive it.    I have directly ascertained that water thus filtered is deprived of all its  germs. For this purpose I have added some of it (with the necessary  precautions against introducing foreign organisms) to very changeable  liquids, such as veal broth, blood, and milk, and have found that there was  no alteration. Such water, then, is incapable of transmitting the germs of  disease.    [Illustration: CHAMBERLAND'S WATER FILTER.]    With an apparatus like the one here figured, and in which the filtering  tube is eight inches in length by about one inch in diameter, about four  and a half gallons of water per day may be obtained when the pressure is  two atmospheres--the mean pressure in Mr. Pasteur's laboratory, where my  experiments were made. Naturally, the discharge is greater or less  according to the pressure. A discharge of three and a half to four and a  half gallons of water seems to me to be sufficient for the needs of an  ordinary household. For schools, hospitals, barracks, etc., it is easy to  obtain the necessary volume of water by associating the tubes in series.  The discharge will be multiplied by the number of tubes.    In the country, or in towns that have no water mains, it will be easy to  devise an arrangement for giving the necessary pressure. An increase in the  porosity of the filtering tube is not to be thought of, as this would allow  very small germs to pass. This filter being a perfect one, we must expect  to see it soil quickly. Filters that do not get foul are just the ones that  do not filter. But with the arrangement that I have adopted the solid  matters deposit upon the external surface of the filter, while the inner  surface always remains perfectly clean. In order to clean the tube, it is  only necessary to take it out and wash it vigorously. As the tube is  entirely of porcelain, it may likewise be plunged into boiling water so as  to destroy the germs that may have entered the"]]]
