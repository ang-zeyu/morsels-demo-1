Reaching into  the depths he held up a handful of something that looked like sticks of  macaroni. \"There it is,\" he said.    \"That powder?\" cried Ned. \"That's a queer kind. I've seen the kind they  use in some guns on the battleships. That powder was in hexagonal form,  about two inches across, and had a hole in the centre. It was colored  brown.\"    \"Well, powder is made in many forms,\" explained Tom. \"A person who has  only seen black gunpowder, with its little grains, would not believe  that this was one grain of the new powder.\"    \"That macaroni stick a grain of powder?\" cried Ned.    \"Yes, we'll call it a grain,\" went on the young inventor, \"just as the  brown, hexagonal cube you saw was a grain. You see, Ned, the idea is to  explode all the powder at once--to get instantaneous action. It must  all burn up at once as soon as it is detonated, or set off.    \"To do that you have to have every grain acted on at the same moment,  and that could not be done if the powder was in one solid chunk, or  closely packed. For that reason they make it in different shapes, so it  will lie loose in the firing chamber, just as a lot of jack-straws are  piled up. In fact, some of the new powder looks like jack-straws. Some,  as this, for instance, looks like macaroni. Other is in cubes, and some  in long strings.\"    As he spoke Tom struck a match and held the flames near the end of one  of the \"macaroni\" sticks.    \"Caesar's grandmother!\" yelled Ned. \"Are you crazy, Tom?\" as he started  to leap for a window.    \"Don't get excited,\" spoke Tom, quietly. \"There's no danger,\" and he  actually set fire to the stick of queer powder, which burned like some  wax taper.    \"But--but--\" stammered Ned.    \"It is only when powder is confined that it explodes,\" Tom explained.  \"If it can burn in the open it's as harmless as water, provided you  don't burn too much at once. But put it in something where the  resulting gases accumulate and can't escape, and then--why, you have an  explosion--that's all.\"    \"Yes--that's all,\" remarked Ned, grimly, as he nervously watched the  burning stick of powder. Tom let it flame for a few seconds, and then  calmly blew it out.    \"You know what a little puff black gunpowder gives, if you burn some  openly on the ground,\" went on Tom; \"don't you, Ned?\"    \"Sure, I've often done that.\"    \"But put that same powder in a tight box, and set fire to it, and you  have a bang instead of a puff. It's the same way with this powder, only  it doesn't even puff, for it burns more slowly.    \"An explosion, you see, is the sudden liberation at one time of the  gases which result when the powder is burned. If the gases are given  off gradually, and in the open, no harm is done. But put a stick like  this in, say, a steel box, all closed up, save a hole for the fuse, and  what do you have? An explosion. That's the principle of all guns and  cannon.    \"But say, Ned, I'm getting to be a regular lecturer. I didn't know I  was running on so. Why didn't you stop me?\"    \"Because I was interested. Go on, tell me some more.\"    \"Not now. I want to get this powder in a safe place. I'm a little  nervous about it after that fire. You see if it had caught, when  tightly packed in the boxes, there would have been a terrific  explosion, though it does burn so harmlessly in the open air. Now let  me see--\"    Tom was interrupted by the postman's whistle, and a little later  Eradicate came in with the mail that had been left in the box at the  shop door. Tom rapidly looked over the letters.    \"Here's the note I want, I think,\" he said, Selecting one.  \"Yes, this  is it. 'Permission is hereby granted,' he read, 'to Thomas Swift to  visit,' and so on, and so on. This is the stuff, Ned!\" he cried.    \"What is it?\"    \"A permit to visit the government proving grounds at Sandy Hook, Ned,  and see 'em test that new big gun I was telling you about. Hurray!  We'll go down there, and I'll see how my ideas fit in with those of the  government's experts.\"    \"Did you say 'we' would go down, Tom?\"    \"I sure did. You'll go with me; won't you?\"    \"Well, I hadn't thought very much about it, but I guess I will.  When  is it?\"    \"A week from today, and I'm going to need all that time to get ready.  Now let's get busy, and we'll arrange to go to Sandy Hook.  I've had  trouble enough to get this permit--I guess I'll put it where it won't  get lost,\" and he locked it in a secret drawer of his desk.    Then the lads stored the powder in a safe place, and soon were busy  about several matters in the shop.          CHAPTER V    OFF TO SANDY HOOK      \"What's the idea of this government test of the big gun, Tom?\" asked  Ned. \"I got so excited about that near-explosion the other day, that I  didn't think to ask you all the particulars.\"    \"Why, the idea is to see if the gun will work, and do all that the  inventor claims for it,\" was the answer. \"They always put a new gun  through more severe tests than anything it will be called on to stand  in actual warfare. They want to see just how much margin of safety  there is.\"    \"Oh I see. And is this one of the guns that are to be used in  fortifying the Panama Canal?\"    \"Well, Ned, I don't know, exactly. You see, the government isn't  telling all its secrets. I assume that it is, and that's why I'm  anxious to see what sort of a gun it is.    \"As a matter of fact, I'm going into this thing on a sort of chance,  just as dad did when he invested in Mr. Peterson's opal mine.\"    \"Do you think anything will come of that, Tom?\"    \"I don't know. If we get down to Panama, after I have made my big gun,  we may take a run over, and see how he is making out.  But, as I said,  I'm going into this big cannon business on a sort of gamble. I have  heard, indirectly, that Uncle Sam intends to use a new type of gun in  fortifying the Panama Canal. It's about forty-nine miles long, you  know, and it will take many guns to cover the whole route, as well as  to protect the two entrances.\"    \"Not so very many if you make a gun that will shoot thirty miles,\"  remarked Ned, with a smile.    \"I'm not so sure I can do it,\" went on Tom. \"But, even at that, quite a  number of guns will be needed. For if any foreign nation, or any  combination of nations, intend to get the canal away from us, they  won't make the attack from one point. They'll come at us seven  different ways for Sunday, and I've never heard yet of a gun that can  shoot seven ways at once. That's why so many will be needed.    \"But, as I said, I don't know just what type the Ordnance Department  will favor, and I want to get a line. Then, even if I invent a cannon  that will outshoot all the others, they may not take mine. Though if  they do, and buy a number of them, I'll be more than repaid for my  labor, besides having the satisfaction of helping my country.\"    \"Good for you, Tom! I wish it was time to go to Sandy Hook now.  I'm  anxious to see that big gun. Do you know anything about it?\"    \"Not very much. I have heard that it is not quite as large as the old  sixteen-inch rifle that they had to throw away because of some trouble,  I don't know just what. It was impractical, in spite of its size and  great range. But this new gun they are going to test is considerably  smaller, I understand.    \"It was invented by a General Waller, and is, I think, about twelve  inches across at the muzzle. In spite of that comparatively small size,  it fires a projectile weighing a thousand pounds, or half a ton, and  takes five hundred pounds of powder. Its range, of course, no one knows  yet, though I have heard it said that General Waller claims it will  shoot twenty miles.\"    \"Whew! Some shot!\"    \"I'm going to beat it,\" declared Tom, \"and I want to do it without  making such a monstrous gun that it will be difficult to cast it.    \"You see, Ned, there is, theoretically, nothing to prevent the casting  of a steel rifled cannon that would be fifty inches across at the  muzzle, and making it a hundred feet long. I mean it could be done on  paper--figured out and all that. But whether you would get a  corresponding increase in power or range, and be able to throw a  relatively larger projectile, is something no one knows, for there  never has been such a gun made. Besides, the strain of the big charge  of powder needed would be enormous. So I don't want merely to make a  giant cannon. I want one that will do a giant's work, and still be  somewhere in the middle-sized class.\"    \"I see. Well, you'll probably get some points at Sandy Hook.\"    \"I think so. We go day after tomorrow.\"    \"Is Mr. Damon going?'    \"I think not. If he does I'll have to get another pass, for mine only  calls for two persons. I got it through a Captain Badger, a friend of  mine, stationed at the Sandy Hook barracks.  He doesn't have anything  to do with the coast defense guns, but he got the pass to the proving  grounds for me.\"    Tom and his chum talked for some time about the prospects for making a  giant cannon, and then the young inventor, with Ned's aid, made some  powder tests, using some of the explosive that had so nearly caught  fire.    \"It isn't just what I want,\" Tom decided, after he had put small  quantities in little steel bombs, and exploded them, at a safe  distance, and under a bank of earth, by means of an electric primer.    \"Why, Tom, that powder certainly burst the bombs all to pieces,\" said  Ned, picking up a shattered piece of steel.    \"I know, but it isn't powerful enough for me. I'm going to send for  samples of another kind, and if I can't get what I want I'll make my  own powder. But come on now, this stuff gives me a headache. Let's take  a little flight in the Humming Bird. We'll go see Mr. Damon,\" and soon  the two lads were in the speedy little monoplane, skimming along like  the birds. The fresh air soon blew away their headaches, caused by the  fumes from the nitro-glycerine, which was the basis of the powder.

Hohenemser admits that fear is a form      of psychic stasis, and I have sought to show that modesty is a      complexus of fears. We may very well accept the conception of      psychic stasis at the outset. The analysis of modesty has still      to be carried very much further.    The discussion of modesty is complicated by the difficulty, and even  impossibility, of excluding closely-allied emotions--shame, shyness,  bashfulness, timidity, etc.--all of which, indeed, however defined, adjoin  or overlap modesty.[3] It is not, however, impossible to isolate the main  body of the emotion of modesty, on account of its special connection, on  the whole, with the consciousness of sex. I here attempt, however  imperfectly, to sketch out a fairly-complete analysis of its constitution  and to trace its development.        In entering upon this investigation a few facts with regard to      the various manifestations of modesty may be helpful to us. I      have selected these from scattered original sources, and have      sought to bring out the variety and complexity of the problems      with which we are here concerned.        The New Georgians of the Solomon Islands, so low a race that they      are ignorant both of pottery and weaving, and wear only a loin      cloth, \"have the same ideas of what is decent with regard to      certain acts and exposures that we ourselves have;\" so that it is      difficult to observe whether they practice circumcision.      (Somerville, _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, 1897, p.      394.)        In the New Hebrides \"the closest secrecy is adopted with regard      to the penis, not at all from a sense of decency, but to avoid      Narak, the _sight_ even of that of another man being considered      most dangerous. The natives of this savage island, accordingly,      wrap the penis around with many yards of calico, and other like      materials, winding and folding them until a preposterous bundle      18 inches, or 2 feet long, and 2 inches or more in diameter is      formed, which is then supported upward by means of a belt, in the      extremity decorated with flowering grasses, etc. The testicles      are left naked.\" There is no other body covering. (Somerville,      _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, 1894, p. 368.)        In the Pelew Islands, says Kubary, as quoted by Bastian, it is      said that when the God Irakaderugel and his wife were creating      man and woman (he forming man and she forming woman), and were at      work on the sexual organs, the god wished to see his consort's      handiwork. She, however, was cross, and persisted in concealing      what she had made. Ever since then women wear an apron of      pandanus-leaves and men go naked. (A. Bastian, _Inselgruppen in      Oceanien_, p. 112.)        In the Pelew Islands, Semper tells us that when approaching a      large water-hole he was surprised to hear an affrighted,      long-drawn cry from his native friends. \"A girl's voice answered      out of the bushes, and my people held us back, for there were      women bathing there who would not allow us to pass. When I      remarked that they were only women, of whom they need not be      afraid, they replied that it was not so, that women had an      unbounded right to punish men who passed them when bathing      without their permission, and could inflict fines or even death.      On this account, the women's bathing place is a safe and favorite      spot for a secret rendezvous. Fortunately a lady's toilet lasts      but a short time in this island.\" (Carl Semper, _Die      Palau-Inseln_, 1873, p. 68.)        Among the Western Tribes of Torres Strait, Haddon states, \"the      men were formerly nude, and the women wore only a leaf petticoat,      but I gather that they were a decent people; now both sexes are      prudish. A man would never go nude before me. The women would      never voluntarily expose their breasts to white men's gaze; this      applies to quite young girls, less so to old women. Amongst      themselves they are, of course, much less particular, but I      believe they are becoming more so.... Formerly, I imagine, there      was no restraint in speech; now there is a great deal of prudery;      for instance, the men were always much ashamed when I asked for      the name of the sexual parts of a woman.\" (A.C. Haddon,      \"Ethnography of the Western Tribes of Torres Straits,\" _Journal      of the Anthropological Institute_, 1890, p. 336.) After a      subsequent expedition to the same region, the author reiterates      his observations as to the \"ridiculously prudish manner\" of the      men, attributable to missionary influence during the past thirty      years, and notes that even the children are affected by it. \"At      Mabuiag, some small children were paddling in the water, and a      boy of about ten years of age reprimanded a little girl of five      or six years because she held up her dress too high.\" (_Reports      of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits_,      vol. v, p. 272.)        \"Although the women of New Guinea,\" Vahness says, \"are very      slightly clothed, they are by no means lacking in a      well-developed sense of decorum. If they notice, for instance,      that any one is paying special attention to their nakedness, they      become ashamed and turn round.\" When a woman had to climb the      fence to enter the wild-pig enclosure, she would never do it in      Vahness's presence. (_Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie_, Verhdlgen.,      1900, Heft 5, p. 415.)        In Australia \"the feeling of decency is decidedly less prevalent      among males than females;\" the clothed females retire out of      sight to bathe. (Curr, _Australian Race_.)        \"Except for waist-bands, forehead-bands, necklets, and armlets,      and a conventional pubic tassel, shell, or, in the case of the      women, a small apron, the Central Australian native is naked. The      pubic tassel is a diminutive structure, about the size of a      five-shilling piece, made of a few short strands of fur-strings      flattened out into a fan-shape and attached to the pubic hair. As      the string, especially at _corrobboree_ times, is covered with      white kaolin or gypsum, it serves as a decoration rather than a      covering. Among the Arunta and Luritcha the women usually wear      nothing, but further north, a small apron is made and worn.\"      (Baldwin Spencer and Gillen, _Native Tribes of Central      Australia_, p. 572.)        Of the Central Australians Stirling says: \"No sense of shame of      exposure was exhibited by the men on removal of the diminutive      articles worn as conventional coverings; they were taken off      _coram populo_, and bartered without hesitation. On the other      hand, some little persuasion was necessary to allow inspection of      the effect of [urethral] sub-incision, assent being given only      after dismissal to a distance of the women and young children. As      to the women, it was nearly always observed that when in camp      without clothing they, especially the younger ones, exhibited by      their attitude a keen sense of modesty, if, indeed, a      consciousness of their nakedness can be thus considered. When we      desired to take a photograph of a group of young women, they were      very coy at the proposal to remove their scanty garments, and      retired behind a wall to do so; but once in a state of nudity      they made no objection to exposure to the camera.\" (_Report of      the Horn Scientific Expedition_, 1896, vol. iv, p. 37.)        In Northern Queensland \"phallocrypts,\" or \"penis-concealers,\"      only used by the males at _corrobborees_ and other public      rejoicings, are either formed of pearl-shell or opossum-string.      The _koom-pa-ra_, or opossum-string form of phallocrypt, forms a      kind of tassel, and is colored red; it is hung from the      waist-belt in the middle line. In both sexes the privates are      only covered on special public occasions, or when in close      proximity to white settlements. (W. Roth, _Ethnological Studies      among the Northwest-Central-Queensland Aborigines_, 1897, pp.      114-115.)        \"The principle of chastity,\" said Forster, of his experiences in      the South Sea Islands in their unspoilt state, \"we found in many      families exceedingly well understood. I have seen many fine women      who, with a modesty mixed with politeness, refuse the greatest      and most tempting offers made them by our forward youths; often      they excuse themselves with a simple _tirra-tano_, 'I am      married,' and at other times they smiled and declined it with      _epia_, 'no.' ... Virtuous women hear a joke without emotion,      which, amongst us, might put some men to the blush. Neither      austerity and anger, nor joy and ecstasy is the consequence, but      sometimes a modest, dignified, serene smile spreads itself over      their face, and seems gently to rebuke the uncouth jester.\" (J.R.      Forster, _Observations made During a Voyage Round the World_,      1728, p. 392.)        Captain Cook, at Tahiti, in 1769, after performing Divine service      on Sunday, witnessed \"Vespers of a very different kind. A young      man, near six feet high, performed the rites of Venus with a      little girl about eleven or twelve years of age, before several      of our people and a great number of the natives, without the      least sense of its being indecent or improper, but, as it      appeared, in perfect conformity to the custom of the place. Among      the spectators were several women of superior rank, who may      properly be said to have assisted at the ceremony; for they gave      instructions to the girl how to perform her part, which, young as      she was, she did not seem much to stand in need of.\" (J.
