The second and third resemble the color-blind man, who sees  but who persists in calling green blue, and _vice versa_.    A fourth man sees in a dream a friend walking in his room;  the vision is so vivid he instantly gets up and strikes a match.  After making sure there is no intruder about the room he looks  at his watch and goes back to bed.  The next day he receives  the unwelcome tidings that his friend died at the exact moment  of the vision.    At another time he hears in his dream a familiar voice cry out in agony.  Soon he hears of a shocking accident or distressing illness befalling  the one whose voice he recognized in the dream.[2]      [2] For authentic records, see Flammarion's ``Unknown.''      The third man, already referred to, has about the same dream experiences,  but calls them strange coincidences or unconscious cerebration, etc.    Again, the fourth man dreams of walking through green fields  of corn, grass or wheat.  He notes after such dreams prosperous  conditions follow for at least a few days.  He also notes,  if the area over which he passes is interspersed with rocks or other  adverse signs, good and bad follow in the wake of the dream.  If he succeeds in climbing a mountain and finds the top barren  he will accomplish his object, but the deal will prove unprofitable.  If it is green and spring-like in appearance, it will yield good results.  If he sees muddy water, sickness, business depression or causes  for jealousy may develop.    A nightmare suggests to the dreamer to be careful of health and diet,  to relax his whole body, to sleep with his arms down and keep plenty  of fresh air in the room.    He sums up the foregoing with a thousand similar dream incidents,  and is led to believe certain dreams possess an element of warning.    There are three pure types of dreams, namely, _subjective_,  _physical_ and _spiritual_.  They relate to the past,  present and future, and are influenced by past or subjective,  physical and spiritual causes.  The latter is always deeply prophetic,  especially when it leaves a vivid impression on the conscious mind.  The former, too, possesses an element of warning and prophecy,  though the true meaning is hidden in symbols or allegory.  They are due to contingent mental pictures of the past  falling upon the conscious mind of the dreamer.  Thus he is back at the old home, and finds mother pale and aged,  or ruddy and healthy, and the lawn withered or green.  It all augurs, according to the aspect the picture assumes,  ill or good fortune.    Physical dreams are more or less unimportant.  They are usually  superinduced by the anxious waking mind, and when this is so they  possess no prophetic significance.    Dreams induced by opiates, fevers, mesmerism and ill health come under  this class.  A man who gambles is liable to dream of cards; if he dreams  of them in deep sleep the warning is to be heeded; but if it comes  as a reverie while he sleeps lightly he should regard it as worthless.  Such dreams reflect only the present condition of the body and mind  of the dreamer; but as the past and present enter into shaping the future,  the reflections thus left on the waking mind should not go by unheeded.    We often observe matters of dress and exterior appearance through mirrors,  and we soon make the necessary alterations to put our bodies in harmony  with existing formalities.  Then, why not study more seriously the mental  images reflected from the mirror of the soul upon our minds through the occult  processes within us?    Thirdly, the spiritual dreams are brought about by the higher self penetrating  the soul realm, and reflecting upon the waking mind approaching events.  When we put our animal mind and soul in harmony with our higher self we  become one with it, and, therefore, one with the universal mind or will by  becoming a part of it.  It is through the higher self we reach the infinite.  It is through the lower self we fall into the whirlpool of matter.    These dreams are a part of the universal mind until they  transpire in the life of man.  After this they go to make a part  of the personal soul.  Whatever has not taken place in the mind,  or life of man, belongs exclusively to the impersonal mind.  But as soon as a man lives or sees a thing, that thing  instantly becomes a part of his soul; hence, the clairvoyant,  or mind reader, never perceives beyond the personal ego,  as the future belongs exclusively to God or the universal mind,  and has no material, subjective existence; therefore, it cannot  be known except through the channels of the higher self,  which is the Truth or the Word that is constantly striving  to manifest itself through the flesh.    Our psychical research people give us conclusive proof of mental  telepathy or telegraphy between finite minds.  Thus communications  or impressions are conveyed many miles from one mind to another.  This phenomenon is easier when one or both of the subjects are  in a state of somnambulence or asleep.    In thought transference or mind reading it is absolutely  necessary to have a positive and a negative subject.  Through the same law that mental impressions are telegraphed  from one finite mind to another a man may place himself in harmony  with the infinite mind and thus receive true and healthful  warnings of coming evil or good.  Homer, Aristotle and other  writers of the ancient classics thought this not improbable.    The statesman, the poet, the philosopher of the Bible were  unanimous in attaching prophetic significance to dreams.  Has the law of ethereal vibrations undergone any recent  changes to debar or molest the communion of the soul with its  spiritual father, any more than it has debarred contact with its  material mother or environments?    We only understand the great laws of nature by effects.  We know that vegetation planted in native soil and properly attended  with light, heat and moisture, will grow and yield a certain  species of fruit.  We may infer how it does this, but we cannot  explain the process of transformation any more than we can explain  why certain tropical birds are burnished with glowing colors,  and that other birds under the murky skies are gray and brown,  while in the Arctic regions they bleach.    In sleep we see, without being awakened, the angry lightning rend  the midnight clouds, and hear the explosive thunder hurl its fury at us;  but can we explain it any more than our scientist can explain the natural  forces of thought, of love and hate, or the subtle intuition of woman?    What of the silhouette or the anthelion of the Scandinavian Alps,  and the aerial cities so often seen by explorers and travelers?  Do not they defy the law of optics?  Must we understand the intricacies  of articulation and the forces back of it before we can appropriate speech?  Must we discard all belief in an infinite mind because we cannot  understand it, and therefore say we are not a part of it because there  is no Infinite?  Should we discard the belief in the infinitude of number,  because we cannot understand it, and therefore say that finite number  is not a part of the infinite?    No scientist or naturalist is so grossly stupid as to deny  the infinite expansion of numbers?  If this be so, it establishes  the infinite of number, of which every finite number is a part,  and thus we have a parallel in mathematics, the very cornerstone  of the exact sciences, for a finite and an infinite mind.  It is from the prototype of this infinite of number, namely,  the infinite of intelligence, that spiritual dreams proceed.  They are, therefore, the reflection of truth upon the dream mind  and occur with less frequency than do dreams of the other two classes.    There are also mixed dreams, due to a multitude of incidents  arising from one or more sources, which being reflected upon  the mind at the same instant, produce an incoherent effect similar  to that which might be produced by running the same newspaper  through two or more presses all of different size type.    Again, if you sit before a mirror where flashlights of faces and  other things are reflected simultaneously and instantly removed,  you will fail to obtain a well-defined impression of what passed  before your mind.    If you should pass on a train, at the speed of two miles a minute,  through a forest of flowers and trees, your mind would be unable  to distinguish one flower or tree from another.    It is in a similar way dream life and incidents may fall upon the mind.    A woman may dream of receiving a letter, and in the same connection see  muddy water, or an arid landscape.  Closely following, in waking life,  she is astonished to receive a letter in about the same manner of her dream,  but the muddy water and the arid landscape are missing.    This is a mixed dream and is due to more than one cause.  The first part is literal in its fulfilment, and belongs to  the spiritual class; the other part of the dream is subjective,  and therefore allegorical in meaning.  Together with the letter,  it was a forewarning of misfortune.    These dreams are more difficult of interpretation than those  belonging to the spiritual type.  In such dreams you may see water,  letters, houses, money, people, and countless other things.  The next day you may cross water or receive a letter; the other  things you may not see, but annoyance or pleasure will follow.    Again, you may have a similar dream and not receive a letter or cross water,  but the waking life will be filled with the other dream pictures and you will  experience disappointing or pleasant surprises as are indicated by the letter  or water sign.    I have selected the allegorical type of dreams for the subject of this work.  Dreams that are common occurrences and are thought by the world  to be meaningless.    I have endeavored, through the occult forces in and about me  to find their esoteric or hidden import.

But while occupied in things for the body, their great ruler did not  neglect matters of the mind. He found that some of his people had good  voices and loved to sing. Others delighted in making poetry. So he  invented or improved the harp, and fixed the rules of verse and song.    Thus ages before writing was known, the Cymry preserved their history  and handed down what the wise ones taught.    Men might be born, live and die, come and go, like leaves on the  trees, which expand in the springtime and fall in the autumn; but  their songs, and poetry, and noble language never die. Even to-day,  the Cymry love the speech of their fathers almost as well as they love  their native land.    Yet things were not always lovely in Honey Land, or as sweet as sugar.  As the tribes scattered far apart to settle in this or that valley,  some had fish, but no salt, and others had plenty of salt, but no  fish. Some had all the venison and bear meat they wanted, but no  barley or oats. The hill men needed what the men on the seashore could  supply. From their sheep and oxen they got wool and leather, and from  the wild beasts fur to keep warm in winter. So many of them grew  expert in trade. Soon there were among them some very rich men who  were the chiefs of the tribes.    In time, hundreds of others learned how to traffic among the tribes  and swap, or barter their goods, for as yet there were no coins for  money, or bank bills. So they established markets or fairs, to which  the girls and boys liked to go and sell their eggs and chickens, for  when the wolves and foxes were killed off, sheep and geese multiplied.    But what hindered the peace of the land, were the feuds, or quarrels,  because the men of one tribe thought they were braver, or better  looking, than those in the other tribe. The women were very apt to  boast that they wore their clothes--which were made of fox and weasel  skins--more gracefully than those in the tribe next to them.    So there was much snarling and quarreling in Cymric Land. The people  were too much like naughty children, or when kiddies are not taught  good manners, to speak gently and to be kind one to the other.    One of the worst quarrels broke out, because in one tribe there were  too many maidens and not enough young men for husbands. This was bad  for the men, for it spoiled them. They had too many women to wait on  them and they grew to be very selfish.    In what might be the next tribe, the trouble was the other way. There  were too many boys, a surplus of men, and not nearly enough girls to  go round. When any young fellow, moping out his life alone and anxious  for a wife, went a-courting in the next tribe, or in their vale, or on  their hill top, he was usually driven off with stones. Then there was  a quarrel between the two tribes.    Any young girl, who sneaked out at night to meet her young man of  another clan, was, when caught, instantly and severely spanked. Then,  with her best clothes taken off, she had to stand tied to a post in  the market place a whole day. Her hair was pulled down in disorder,  and all the dogs were allowed to bark at her. The girls made fun of  the poor thing, while they all rubbed one forefinger over the other,  pointed at her and cried, \"Fie, for shame!\" while the boys called her  hard names.    If it were known that the young man who wanted a wife had visited a  girl in the other tribe, his spear and bow and arrows were taken away  from him till the moon was full. The other boys and the girls treated  him roughly and called him hard names, but he dare not defend himself  and had to suffer patiently. This was all because of the feud between  the two tribes.    This went on until the maidens in the valley, who were very many,  while yet lovely and attractive, became very lonely and miserable;  while the young men, all splendid hunters and warriors, multiplied in  the hill country. They were wretched in mind, because not one could  get a wife, for all the maidens in their own tribe were already  engaged, or had been mated.    One day news came to the young men on the hill top, that the valley  men were all off on a hunting expedition. At once, without waiting a  moment, the poor lonely bachelors plucked up courage. Then, armed with  ropes and straps, they marched in a body to the village in the valley  below. There, they seized each man a girl, not waiting for any maid to  comb her hair, or put on a new frock, or pack up her clothes, or carry  any thing out of her home, and made off with her, as fast as one pair  of legs could move with another pair on top.    At first, this looked like rough treatment--for a lovely girl, thus to  be strapped to a brawny big fellow; but after a while, the girls  thought it was great fun to be married and each one to have a man to  caress, and fondle, and scold, and look for, and boss around; for each  wife, inside of her own hut was quite able to rule her husband. Every  one of these new wives was delighted to find a man who cared so much  for her as to come after her, and risk his life to get her, and each  one admired her new, brave husband.    Yet the brides knew too well that their men folks, fathers and  brothers, uncles and cousins, would soon come back to attempt their  recapture.    And this was just what happened. When a runner brought, to the valley  men now far away, the news of the rape of their daughters, the hunters  at once ceased chasing the deer and marched quickly back to get the  girls and make them come home.    The hill men saw the band of hunters coming after their daughters.  They at once took their new wives into a natural rocky fortress, on  the top of a precipice, which overlooked the lake.    This stronghold had only one entrance, a sort of gateway of rocks, in  front of which was a long steep, narrow path. Here the hill men stood,  to resist the attack and hold their prizes.    It was a case of a very few defenders, assaulted by a multitude, and  the battle was long and bloody. The hill men scorned to surrender and  shot their arrows and hurled their javelins with desperate valor. They  battled all day from sunrise until the late afternoon, when shadows  began to lengthen. The stars, one by one came out and both parties,  after setting sentinels, lay down to rest.    In the morning, again, charge after charge was made. Sword beat  against shield and helmet, and clouds of arrows were shot by the  archers, who were well posted in favorable situations, on the rocks.  Long before noon, the field below was dotted and the narrow pass was  choked with dead bodies. In the afternoon, after a short rest and  refreshed with food, the valley men, though finding that only four of  the hill fighters were alive, stood off at a distance and with their  long bows and a shower of arrows left not one to breathe.    Now, thought the victors, we shall get our maidens back again. So,  taking their time to wash off the blood and dust, to bind up their  wounds, and to eat their supper, they thought it would be an easy job  to load up all the girls on their ox-carts and carry them home.    But the valley brides, thus suddenly made widows, were too true to  their brave husbands. So, when they had seen the last of their lovers  quiet in death, they stripped off all their ornaments and fur robes,  until all stood together, each clad in her own innocence, as pure in  their purpose as if they were a company of Druid priestesses.    Then, chanting their death song, they marched in procession to the  tall cliff, that rose sheer out of the water. One by one, each  uttering the name of her beloved, leaped into the waves.    Men at a distance, knowing nothing of the fight, and sailors and  fishermen far off on the water, thought that a flock of white birds  were swooping down from their eyrie, into the sea to get their food  from the fishes. But when none rose up above the waters, they  understood, and later heard the whole story of the valor of the men  and the devotion of the women.    The solemn silence of night soon brooded over the scene.    The men of the valley stayed only long enough to bury their own dead.  Then they marched home and their houses were filled with mourning. Yet  they admired the noble sacrifice of their daughters and were proud of  them. Afterwards they raised stone monuments on the field of  slaughter.    To-day, this water is called the Lake of the Maidens, and the great  stones seen near the beach are the memorials marking the place of the  slain in battle.    During many centuries, the ancient custom of capturing the bride, with  resistance from her male relatives, was vigorously kept up. In the  course of time, however, this was turned into a mimic play, with much  fun and merriment. Yet, the girls appear to like it, and some even  complain if it is not rough enough to seem almost real.          V      THE BOY THAT WAS NAMED TROUBLE      In one of the many \"Co-eds,\" or places with this name, in ancient and  forest-covered Wales, there was a man who had one of the most  beautiful mares in all the world. Yet great misfortunes befell both  this Co-ed mare and her owner.    Every night, on the first of May, the mare gave birth to a pretty  little colt. Yet no one ever saw, or could ever tell what became of  any one, or all of the colts. Each and all, and one by one, they  disappeared. Nobody knew where they were, or went, or what had become  of them.    At last, the owner, who had no children, and loved little horses,  determined not to lose another. He girded on his sword, and with his  trusty spear, stood guard all night in the stable to catch the mortal  robber, as he supposed he must be.    When on this same night of May first, the mare foaled again, and the  colt stood up on its long legs, the man greatly admired the young  creature. It looked already, as if it could, with its own legs, run  away and escape from"]]]
