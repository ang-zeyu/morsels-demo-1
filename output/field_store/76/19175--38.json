There must be  still other types of abbreviation. How common is the excitation of the  motor nerves in silent speech, in which no audible or visible  articulations result, is shown by the frequent experience of fatigue in  the speech organs, particularly in the larynx, after unusually  stimulating reading or intensive thinking.    All the modifications so far considered are directly patterned on the  typical process of normal speech. Of very great interest and importance  is the possibility of transferring the whole system of speech symbolism  into other terms than those that are involved in the typical process.  This process, as we have seen, is a matter of sounds and of movements  intended to produce these sounds. The sense of vision is not brought  into play. But let us suppose that one not only hears the articulated  sounds but sees the articulations themselves as they are being executed  by the speaker. Clearly, if one can only gain a sufficiently high degree  of adroitness in perceiving these movements of the speech organs, the  way is opened for a new type of speech symbolism--that in which the  sound is replaced by the visual image of the articulations that  correspond to the sound. This sort of system has no great value for most  of us because we are already possessed of the auditory-motor system of  which it is at best but an imperfect translation, not all the  articulations being visible to the eye. However, it is well known what  excellent use deaf-mutes can make of \"reading from the lips\" as a  subsidiary method of apprehending speech. The most important of all  visual speech symbolisms is, of course, that of the written or printed  word, to which, on the motor side, corresponds the system of delicately  adjusted movements which result in the writing or typewriting or other  graphic method of recording speech. The significant feature for our  recognition in these new types of symbolism, apart from the fact that  they are no longer a by-product of normal speech itself, is that each  element (letter or written word) in the system corresponds to a specific  element (sound or sound-group or spoken word) in the primary system.  Written language is thus a point-to-point equivalence, to borrow a  mathematical phrase, to its spoken counterpart. The written forms are  secondary symbols of the spoken ones--symbols of symbols--yet so close  is the correspondence that they may, not only in theory but in the  actual practice of certain eye-readers and, possibly, in certain types  of thinking, be entirely substituted for the spoken ones. Yet the  auditory-motor associations are probably always latent at the least,  that is, they are unconsciously brought into play. Even those who read  and think without the slightest use of sound imagery are, at last  analysis, dependent on it. They are merely handling the circulating  medium, the money, of visual symbols as a convenient substitute for the  economic goods and services of the fundamental auditory symbols.    The possibilities of linguistic transfer are practically unlimited. A  familiar example is the Morse telegraph code, in which the letters of  written speech are represented by a conventionally fixed sequence of  longer or shorter ticks. Here the transfer takes place from the written  word rather than directly from the sounds of spoken speech. The letter  of the telegraph code is thus a symbol of a symbol of a symbol. It does  not, of course, in the least follow that the skilled operator, in order  to arrive at an understanding of a telegraphic message, needs to  transpose the individual sequence of ticks into a visual image of the  word before he experiences its normal auditory image. The precise method  of reading off speech from the telegraphic communication undoubtedly  varies widely with the individual. It is even conceivable, if not  exactly likely, that certain operators may have learned to think  directly, so far as the purely conscious part of the process of thought  is concerned, in terms of the tick-auditory symbolism or, if they happen  to have a strong natural bent toward motor symbolism, in terms of the  correlated tactile-motor symbolism developed in the sending of  telegraphic messages.    Still another interesting group of transfers are the different gesture  languages, developed for the use of deaf-mutes, of Trappist monks vowed  to perpetual silence, or of communicating parties that are within seeing  distance of each other but are out of earshot. Some of these systems are  one-to-one equivalences of the normal system of speech; others, like  military gesture-symbolism or the gesture language of the Plains Indians  of North America (understood by tribes of mutually unintelligible forms  of speech) are imperfect transfers, limiting themselves to the rendering  of such grosser speech elements as are an imperative minimum under  difficult circumstances. In these latter systems, as in such still more  imperfect symbolisms as those used at sea or in the woods, it may be  contended that language no longer properly plays a part but that the  ideas are directly conveyed by an utterly unrelated symbolic process or  by a quasi-instinctive imitativeness. Such an interpretation would be  erroneous. The intelligibility of these vaguer symbolisms can hardly be  due to anything but their automatic and silent translation into the  terms of a fuller flow of speech.    We shall no doubt conclude that all voluntary communication of ideas,  aside from normal speech, is either a transfer, direct or indirect, from  the typical symbolism of language as spoken and heard or, at the least,  involves the intermediary of truly linguistic symbolism. This is a fact  of the highest importance. Auditory imagery and the correlated motor  imagery leading to articulation are, by whatever devious ways we follow  the process, the historic fountain-head of all speech and of all  thinking. One other point is of still greater importance. The ease with  which speech symbolism can be transferred from one sense to another,  from technique to technique, itself indicates that the mere sounds of  speech are not the essential fact of language, which lies rather in the  classification, in the formal patterning, and in the relating of  concepts. Once more, language, as a structure, is on its inner face the  mold of thought. It is this abstracted language, rather more than the  physical facts of speech, that is to concern us in our inquiry.    There is no more striking general fact about language than its  universality. One may argue as to whether a particular tribe engages in  activities that are worthy of the name of religion or of art, but we  know of no people that is not possessed of a fully developed language.  The lowliest South African Bushman speaks in the forms of a rich  symbolic system that is in essence perfectly comparable to the speech of  the cultivated Frenchman. It goes without saying that the more abstract  concepts are not nearly so plentifully represented in the language of  the savage, nor is there the rich terminology and the finer definition  of nuances that reflect the higher culture. Yet the sort of linguistic  development that parallels the historic growth of culture and which, in  its later stages, we associate with literature is, at best, but a  superficial thing. The fundamental groundwork of language--the  development of a clear-cut phonetic system, the specific association of  speech elements with concepts, and the delicate provision for the formal  expression of all manner of relations--all this meets us rigidly  perfected and systematized in every language known to us. Many primitive  languages have a formal richness, a latent luxuriance of expression,  that eclipses anything known to the languages of modern civilization.  Even in the mere matter of the inventory of speech the layman must be  prepared for strange surprises. Popular statements as to the extreme  poverty of expression to which primitive languages are doomed are simply  myths. Scarcely less impressive than the universality of speech is its  almost incredible diversity. Those of us that have studied French or  German, or, better yet, Latin or Greek, know in what varied forms a  thought may run. The formal divergences between the English plan and the  Latin plan, however, are comparatively slight in the perspective of what  we know of more exotic linguistic patterns. The universality and the  diversity of speech lead to a significant inference. We are forced to  believe that language is an immensely ancient heritage of the human  race, whether or not all forms of speech are the historical outgrowth of  a single pristine form. It is doubtful if any other cultural asset of  man, be it the art of drilling for fire or of chipping stone, may lay  claim to a greater age. I am inclined to believe that it antedated even  the lowliest developments of material culture, that these developments,  in fact, were not strictly possible until language, the tool of  significant expression, had itself taken shape.          II    THE ELEMENTS OF SPEECH      We have more than once referred to the \"elements of speech,\" by which we  understood, roughly speaking, what are ordinarily called \"words.\" We  must now look more closely at these elements and acquaint ourselves with  the stuff of language. The very simplest element of speech--and by  \"speech\" we shall hence-forth mean the auditory system of speech  symbolism, the flow of spoken words--is the individual sound, though, as  we shall see later on, the sound is not itself a simple structure but  the resultant of a series of independent, yet closely correlated,  adjustments in the organs of speech.

I'll show it to you.\"          XII      OLD MR. TOAD SHOWS HIS TONGUE      To show one's tongue, as you well know,      Is not considered nice to do;    But if it were like Mr. Toad's      I'd want to show it--wouldn't you?    I'm quite sure you would. You see, if it were like Old Mr. Toad's, it would  be such a wonderful tongue that I suspect you would want everybody to see  it. Old Mr. Toad thinks his tongue the most satisfactory tongue in the  world. In fact, he is quite sure that without it he couldn't get along at  all, and I don't know as he could. And yet very few of his neighbors know  anything about that tongue and how different it is from most other tongues.  Peter Rabbit didn't until Old Mr. Toad showed him after Peter had puzzled  and puzzled over the mysterious way in which bugs and flies disappeared  whenever they happened to come within two inches or less of Old Mr. Toad.    What Peter couldn't understand was what Old Mr. Toad did with a tongue that  would reach two inches beyond his mouth. He said as much.    \"I'll show you my tongue, and then you'll wish you had one just like it,\"  said Old Mr. Toad, with a twinkle in his eyes.    He opened his big mouth and slowly ran his tongue out its full length.  \"Why! Why-ee!\" exclaimed Peter. \"It's fastened at the wrong end!\"    \"No such thing!\" replied Old Mr. Toad indignantly. \"If it was fastened at  the other end, how could I run it out so far?\"    \"But mine and all other tongues that I ever have seen are fastened way down  in the throat,\" protested Peter. \"Yours is fastened at the other end, way  in the very front of your mouth. I never heard of such a thing.\"    \"There are a great many things you have never heard of, Peter Rabbit,\"  replied Old Mr. Toad drily. \"Mine is the right way to have a tongue.  Because it is fastened way up in the front of my mouth that way, I can use  the whole of it. You see it goes out its full length. Then, when I draw it  in with a bug on the end of it, I just turn it over so that the end that  was out goes way back in my throat and takes the bug with it to just the  right place to swallow.\"    Peter thought this over for a few minutes before he ventured another  question. \"I begin to understand,\" said he, \"but how do you hold on to the  bug with your tongue?\"    \"My tongue is sticky, of course, Mr. Stupid,\" replied Old Mr. Toad, looking  very much disgusted. \"Just let me touch a bug with it, and he's mine every  time.\"    Peter thought this over. Then he felt of his own tongue. \"Mine isn't  sticky,\" said he very innocently.    Old Mr. Toad laughed right out. \"Perhaps if it was, you couldn't ask so  many questions,\" said he. \"Now watch me catch that fly.\" His funny little  tongue darted out, and the fly was gone.    [Illustration: His funny little tongue darted out, and the fly was gone.]    \"It certainly is very handy,\" said Peter politely. \"I think we are going to  have more rain, and I'd better be getting back to the dear Old Briarpatch.  Very much obliged to you, Mr. Toad. I think you are very wonderful.\"    \"Not at all,\" replied Old Mr. Toad. \"I've simply got the things I need in  order to live, just as you have the things you need. I couldn't get along  with your kind of a tongue, but no more could you get along with mine. If  you live long enough, you will learn that Old Mother Nature makes no  mistakes. She gives each of us what we need, and each one has different  needs.\"          XIII      PETER RABBIT IS IMPOLITE    Peter Rabbit couldn't get Old Mr. Toad off his mind. He had discovered so  many interesting things about Old Mr. Toad that he was almost on the point  of believing him to be the most interesting of all his neighbors. And his  respect for Old Mr. Toad had become very great indeed. Of course. Who  wouldn't respect any one with such beautiful eyes and such a sweet voice  and such a wonderful tongue? Yet at the same time Peter felt very foolish  whenever he remembered that all his life he had been acquainted with Old  Mr. Toad without really knowing him at all. There was one comforting  thought, and that was that most of his neighbors were just as ignorant  regarding Old Mr. Toad as Peter had been.    \"Funny,\" mused Peter, \"how we can live right beside people all our lives  and not really know them at all. I suppose that is why we should never  judge people hastily. I believe I will go hunt up Old Mr. Toad and see if I  can find out anything more.\"    Off started Peter, lipperty-lipperty-lip. He didn't know just where to go,  now that Old Mr. Toad had left the Smiling Pool, but he had an idea that he  would not be far from their meeting place of the day before, when Old Mr.  Toad had explained about his wonderful tongue. But when he got there, Peter  found no trace of Old Mr. Toad. You see, it had rained the day before, and  that is just the kind of weather that a Toad likes best for traveling.  Peter ought to have thought of that, but he didn't. He hunted for awhile  and finally gave it up and started up the Crooked Little Path with the idea  of running over for a call on Johnny Chuck in the Old Orchard.    Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun was shining his brightest, and Peter soon  forgot all about Old Mr. Toad. He scampered along up the Crooked Little  Path, thinking of nothing in particular but how good it was to be alive,  and occasionally kicking up his heels for pure joy. He had just done this  when his ears caught the sound of a queer noise a little to one side of the  Crooked Little Path. Instantly Peter stopped and sat up to listen. There it  was again, and it seemed to come from under an old piece of board. It was  just a little, rustling sound, hardly to be heard.    \"There's some one under that old board,\" thought Peter, and peeped under.  All he could see was that there was something moving. Instantly Peter was  all curiosity. Whoever was there was not very big. He was sure of that. Of  course that meant that he had nothing to fear. So what do you think Peter  did? Why, he just pulled that old board over. And when he did that, he saw,  whom do you think? Why, Old Mr. Toad, to be sure.    But such a sight as Old Mr. Toad was! Peter just stared. For a full minute  he couldn't find his voice. Old Mr. Toad was changing his clothes! Yes,  Sir, that is just what Old Mr. Toad was doing. He was taking off his old  suit, and under it was a brand new one. But such a time as he was having!  He was opening and shutting his big mouth, and drawing his hind legs under  him, and rubbing them against his body. Then Peter saw a strange thing. He  saw that Old Mr. Toad's old suit had split in several places, and he was  getting it off by sucking it into his mouth!    In a few minutes his hind legs were free of the old suit, and little by  little it began to be pulled free from his body. All the time Old Mr. Toad  was working very hard to suck it at the corners of his big mouth. He glared  angrily at Peter, but he couldn't say anything because his mouth was too  full. He looked so funny that Peter just threw himself on the ground and  rolled over and over with laughter. This made Old Mr. Toad glare more  angrily than ever, but he couldn't say anything, not a word.    When he had got his hands free by pulling the sleeves of his old coat off  inside out, he used his hands to pull the last of it over his head. Then he  gulped very hard two or three times to swallow his old suit, and when the  last of it had disappeared, he found his voice.    \"Don't you know that it is the most impolite thing in the world to look at  people when they are changing their clothes?\" he sputtered.          XIV      OLD MR. TOAD DISAPPEARS      Admit your fault when you've done wrong,    And don't postpone it over long.    Peter Rabbit didn't blame Old Mr. Toad a bit for being indignant because  Peter had watched him change his suit. It wasn't a nice thing to do. Old  Mr. Toad had looked very funny while he was struggling out of his old suit,  and Peter just couldn't help laughing at him. But he realized that he had  been very impolite, and he very meekly told Old Mr. Toad so.    \"You see, it was this way,\" explained Peter. \"I heard something under that  old board, and I just naturally turned it over to find out what was there.\"    \"Hump!\" grunted Old Mr. Toad.    \"I didn't have the least idea that you were there,\" continued Peter. \"When  I found who it was, and what you were doing, I couldn't help watching  because it was so interesting, and I couldn't help laughing because you  really did look so funny. But I'm sorry, Mr. Toad. Truly I am. I didn't  mean to be so impolite. I promise never to do it again. I don't suppose,  Mr. Toad, that it seems at all wonderful to you that you can change your  suit that way, but it does to me. I had heard that you swallowed your old  suits, but I never half believed it. Now I know it is so and just how you  do it, and I feel as if I had learned something worth knowing. Do you know,  I think you are one of the most interesting and wonderful of all my  neighbors, and I'll never laugh at or tease you again, Mr. Toad.\"    \"Hump!\" grunted Old Mr. Toad again, but it was very clear that he was a  little flattered by Peter's interest in him and was rapidly recovering his  good nature.    \"There is one thing I don't understand yet,\" said Peter, \"and that is where  you go to to sleep all winter. Do you go down into the mud at the bottom of  the Smiling Pool the way Grandfather Frog does?\"    \"Certainly not!\" retorted Old Mr. Toad. \"Use your common sense, Peter  Rabbit. If I had spent the winter in the Smiling Pool, do you suppose I  would have left it to come way up here and then have turned right around  and gone back there to sing? I'm not so fond of long journeys as all that.\"    \"That's so.\" Peter looked foolish. \"I didn't think of that when I spoke.\"    \"The trouble with you, and with a lot of other people, is that you speak  "]]]
