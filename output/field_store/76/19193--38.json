Roswell complimented \"the beauty of said Almira's hair, whereupon she  graciously consented to present him with a lock of the same, and he  humbly confesses that he accepted, kissed, and pressed it to his  heart.\"    Next morning, as they stood side by side, with Roswell holding her hand  \"and carelessly turning over the leaves of a Bible,\" his eye  accidentally rested on this passage of the book of Jeremiah: \"As for  me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto  you.\" And \"thereupon he pointed out such text to said Mary Almira, and  she responded to the same with a blush and a smile.\" Roswell further  confessed, \"that with the kind permission of said Mary Almira he did at  various times press the hand of said Mary Almira, and with her like  gracious permission did kiss her hand, her cheek, and her lips.\" Who,  with such kind and gracious permission, would have confined himself to  remarks about the weather?    Such were the only \"artifices and persuasions, ways and means\" by which  Roswell came between Mary Almira and the promise she had made to the  absent Jeremiah--the same ways and means that have been employed from  the days of Adam, and which will be successful while woman is fair and  man is bold. It was Roswell's belief that \"his attentions and addresses  were from the first agreeable to Mary's feelings and welcome to her  heart,\" and he swore \"that they were always permitted and received with  great kindness and sweetness of manner.\"    When Mary left Fayetteville, on Wednesday, September 19th, it was  \"appointed\" that he should call on her at Brattleboro on the following  Wednesday, and like a true knight he kept his tryst. That his reception  was not frigid may be inferred from the record of the calls that  followed in rapid succession, to-wit: Thursday afternoon; Monday,  October 2d, evening; Tuesday afternoon and evening; Wednesday afternoon  and evening; Wednesday (October 9th) afternoon and evening; Friday  evening; Saturday evening, and Sunday forenoon and evening.    No wonder the report of the bombardment reached the ears of widow  Susanna at Windsor, fifty miles away, and Justice and Mrs. Jonathan  \"expostulated with Mary Almira upon the impropriety, as they called it,  of her receiving the attentions of Roswell without informing her  mother.\"    Space forbids the recital of the uninterrupted, undisturbed, and  agreeable conversations between the young twain that are to be found in  the pleadings in this case. They were brought to a sharp conclusion by  the receipt of a letter from Susanna ordering her daughter to return to  Windsor forthwith. Justice Jonathan remarked that Mrs. Susanna was  \"undoubtedly right, for this young lady ought not to be receiving the  gallantries from one young gentleman when she was under engagement to  another.\"    The mother's letter was received Saturday evening, October 12th, and  produced consternation in the breasts of the young lovers, Mary  clinging around Roswell's neck \"with all the ardor of youthful,  passionate love.\" They resolved to wed without the knowledge, consent,  or blessing of Mrs. Susanna or Jeremiah, and on the morning of October  15th, 1832, Roswell went to the house of Justice Jonathan by  appointment \"to be joined in marriage unto said Mary Almira according  to law.\" Justice and Mrs. Jonathan expostulated against such a marriage  without Mrs. Susanna being first consulted, and after a long conference  Justice Jonathan flatly declined to tie the civil knot. It was finally  decided that the marriage should take place at Putney, a small town of  Windham County, some twelve miles on the Post-road to Windsor. Justice  Jonathan proceeded with the young lady in his carriage, and in due  course arrived at Putney. There he was surprised to find the ardent and  impatient Roswell, who, although behind at the start, had passed him on  the way, and had already made the necessary preparations with Justice  of the Peace Asa to perform the statutory ceremony. This followed \"in a  solemn, serious, and impressive manner in the front room of the public  house, the said Jonathan alone being present besides the parties and  the magistrate.\"    The relations of Roswell and Mary Almira as man and wife began and  ended before Justice Asa in that public house in Putney. In the  language of the pleadings: \"Immediately, within a few minutes after  said marriage ceremony, said Mary Almira went with Justice Jonathan  toward Windsor, and Roswell in a short time returned to his residence  at Fayetteville.\"    There were deeper consequences involved in that simple parting than  could have been imagined by any of the parties or than are concealed in  the musty and voluminous court records of Windsor County and the state  of Vermont.    Eugene Field had an entirely different conception of the nature of this  marriage from that revealed by the record. According to his version,  there was an old blue law in Vermont which rendered it necessary, in  order to exonerate the groom in a runaway match from any other motive  than love and affection, that the bride should be divested of all her  earthly goods. So when Mary Almira arrived at Putney he thought that  she retired to a closet, removed her clothing, and, thrusting her arm  through a hole in the door, was joined in holy wedlock to Roswell, who,  with the Justice and the witnesses, remained in the outer room.    Eugene Field undoubtedly derived this version of his father's marriage  from the tradition of one that actually took place in the Field mansion  on Newfane Hill in 1789. That was the marriage of Major Moses Joy of  Putney to Mrs. Hannah Wood of Newfane, and the unique nature of the  proceedings followed legal advice in order to avoid any responsibility  for the debts of Mrs. Ward's former husband, who had died insolvent.  The story which I find in the Centennial history of Newfane is as  follows:    \"Mrs. Ward placed herself in a closet with a tire-woman, who stripped  her of all clothing, and while in a perfectly nude state she thrust her  fair round arm through a diamond hole in the door of the closet, and  the gallant Major clasped the hand of the nude and buxom widow, and was  married in due form by the jolliest parson in Vermont. At the close of  the ceremony the tire-woman dressed the bride in a complete wardrobe  which the Major had provided and caused to be deposited in the closet  at the commencement of the ceremony. She came out elegantly dressed in  silk, satin, and lace, and there was kissing all around.\"    To resume our story. On leaving Putney, accompanied by Justice  Jonathan, Mary Almira returned to her mother's residence at Windsor.  Nothing was communicated to Mrs. Susanna or to the relatives of the  young bride in regard to the ceremony at Putney. But they, being aware  of the engagement to Jeremiah, and having heard rumors of the  attentions of Roswell, thought propriety demanded an early fulfilment  of the prior engagement. On the day of her arrival home, and on October  21st and 31st, Mary wrote to Roswell letters, from which we have the  assurance of the Supreme Court of Vermont: \"It would appear that she  entertained a strong affection for him and probably viewed him as the  husband with whom she should thereafter live, although the last letter  does not breathe the same affection as the former ones.\"    But the plot was thickening. On the day after her return home Mary also  wrote to Jeremiah in Boston, and a fortnight had not elapsed before she  wrote again, \"a very pressing letter, urging him to come immediately to  Windsor.\" Roswell learned from Mary's letters that her friends were  opposed to her forming any connection, except with Jeremiah, and he  made the mistake of replying by letter instead of appearing in person,  urging his claims and carrying off his bride.    Some time before the 1st of November the family of Mary had heard of  the ceremony at Putney, for on Jeremiah's arrival, in lover-like  compliance with her urgent message, he was informed of the situation.  After a hurried council of war, and under legal advice, the following  letter was drafted and forwarded to Roswell by the hands of Judge  Bikens, the family lawyer:      To Mr. Roswell Field:      _Sir_: Moments of deep consideration and much reflection have at    length caused me to see in its proper light the whole of my late    visit to Brattleboro. That I have been led by you and others to a    course of conduct which my own feelings, reason, and sense entirely    disapprove, is now very clear to me. I therefore write this to    inform you that I am not willing on any account to see you again.    Neither will I by any course you can adopt be prevailed upon to view    the matter in a different light from what I now do. I leave you the    alternative of forever preventing the public avowal of a disgraceful    transaction, of which you yourself said you were ashamed.      Mary A.    This veiled repudiation of the marriage at Putney was placed in  Roswell's hands by Judge Bikens and was instantly \"pronounced an  impudent forgery.\" Being in the dark as to how far Mary's family had  been informed of their marriage, Roswell avoided any expression that  might reveal it to Judge Bikens, and refused to accept the letter as a  true expression of his wife's feelings and wishes. He at once wrote to  her, urging that their marriage should be made public and that thus an  end should be put to the suit of Jeremiah. To this Mary made reply that  the above letter \"contained her real sentiments.\" Before this note  reached Fayetteville Roswell had started for Windsor. On the way he  halted his horse at Putney, where he learned that Mary's family was  fully informed of the marriage as performed by Justice Asa."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions — Volume 2 (#5)"],[1,"in my sister is  further evidenced in the following letter written in gamboge brown:      CHICAGO, July the 2d, 1885.      DEAR MISS:      In order that you may no longer groan under the erroneous impression    which you appear to harbor, touching my physique, I remit to you a    photograph of a majority of myself. The photograph was made last    December, when I was, so to speak, at my perihelion in the matter of    avoirdupois. You may be gratified to know that I have not shrunken    much since that time. I have taken the timely precaution to label the    picture in order that none of your Fredericton people thumbing over    your domestic album shall mistake me for either a young Episcopal    rector or a rising young negro minstrel.      The several drawings and paintings I have sent you ever and anon at    your brother's expense are really not the best samples of my art. Mr.    Walter Cranston Larned, a wealthy young tennis player of this city,    has most of my _chef d'oeuvres_ in his private gallery. I hope    to be able to paint you a landscape in oil very soon. There is no    sacrifice I would not be willing to make for one whom I esteem so    highly as I do you. It might be just as well not to read this line to    the old folks. Your brother Slosson has recently developed an    insatiate passion for horse racing, and in consequence of his losses    at pools I find him less prone to regale me with sumptuous cheer than    he was before the racing season broke out. The prince, too, has    blossomed out as a patron of the track, and I am slowly becoming more    and more aware that this is a bitter world. I think I may safely say    that I look wholly to such noble, generous young women as you and    your sisters to preserve in me a consciousness that there is in life    such a boon as generosity.      You will observe (if you have any eye for color) that I pen you these    lines in gamboge brown; this is because Fourth of July is so near at    hand. This side of the line we are fairly reeking with patriotism    just now; even that mugwump-alien--your brother--contemplates    celebrating in a fitting manner the anniversary of our country's    independence of _British Tyranny_!      Will you please slap Bessie for me--the pert minx! I heard of her    remarks about my story of Mary Matilda and the Prince.      Believe me as ever,      Sincerely yours,      EUGENE FIELD.    The story of \"How Mary Matilda Won a Prince\" was the third in what  Field called his \"Aunt Mary Matilda Series.\" The first of these was  \"The Lonesome Little Shoe\" (see \"The Holy Cross and Other Tales\" of his  collected works), which, after it was printed in the Morning News, was  cut out and pasted in a little brown manila pamphlet, with marginal  illustrations of the most fantastic nature. The title page of this  precious specimen of Fieldiana is characteristic:      THE LONESOME LITTLE SHOE:      BEING A WONDERFUL NARRATIVE CULLED FROM    THE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF EUGENE FIELD      1885.      PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED      DEDICATED TO AUNT MARY MATILDA'S PRESENT    AND FUTURE NEPHEWS AND NIECES,    THEIR HEIRS, ASSIGNS AND ASSIGNEES    FOREVER      CANADIAN TRACT SOCIETY      (COPYRIGHT)    What became of the second of this wonderful series no one knows. The  third, \"How Mary Won a Prince,\" is the only instance that has come  under my notice where Field put any of his compositions in typewriter.  This was done to make the first edition consist of a single copy. The  prince and hero of this romantic tale was our associate, John F.  Ballantyne, and the story itself was \"Inscribed to the beautiful,  accomplished, amiable and ever-to-be-revered, Miss Mary Matilda  Thompson, of Frederickton, York County, New Brunswick, Dominion of  Canada, 1885.\" It was said to be \"elegantly illustrated,\" of which the  reader may judge from the accompanying reproductions.      HOW MARY MATILDA WON A PRINCE.      A gypsy had told Mary Matilda that she would marry a prince. This was    when Mary Matilda was a little girl. She had given the gypsy a nice,    fresh bun, and the gypsy was so grateful that she said she would tell    the little girl's fortune, so Mary Matilda held out her hand and the    old gypsy looked at it very closely.      \"You are very generous,\" said the gypsy, \"and your generosity will    cause a prince to fall in love with you; the prince will rescue you    from a great danger and you will wed the prince.\"      Having uttered these strange words, the gypsy went away and shortly    after was sentenced to ten years in the penitentiary for having    robbed a hen-roost.      Mary Matilda grew from childhood to be the most beautiful maiden in    all the province; none was so beautiful and so witty as she. Withal    she was so amiable and benevolent that all loved her, even those who    envied her the transcendent charms with which she was endowed. As the    unfortunate gypsy had predicted, Mary Matilda was the most generous    maiden on earth and the fame of her goodness was wide-spread.      Now Mary Matilda had an older brother who had gone to a far-off    country to become rich, and to accomplish those great political    reforms to which his ambition inclined him. His name was Slosson, and    in the far-off country he fell in with two young men of his own age    who were of similar ambition. But they were even poorer than Slosson,    and what particularly grieved them was the fact that their lineage    was obscured by dark clouds of doubt. That is to say, they were    unable to determine with any degree of positiveness whether they were    of noble extraction; their parents refused to inform them, and    consequently they were deeply distressed, as you can well imagine.    Slosson was much charmed with their handsome bearing, chivalric ways,    and honorable aspirations, and his pity was evoked by their poverty    and their frequent sufferings for the very requirements of life.    Freely he shared his little all with them, in return for which they    gave him their gratitude and affection. One day Slosson wrote a    letter to his sister Mary Matilda, saying: \"A hard winter is coming    on and our store of provisions is nearly exhausted. My two friends    are in much distress and so am I. We have accomplished a political    revolution, but under the civil service laws we can hardly expect an    office.\"      Mary Matilda was profoundly touched by this letter. Her tender heart    bled whenever she thought of her absent brother, and instinctively    her sympathies went out toward his two companions in distress. So in    her own quiet, maidenly way she set about devising a means for the    relief of the unfortunate young men. She made a cake, a beautiful    cake stuffed with plums and ornamented with a lovely design    representing the lost Pleiad, which you perhaps know was a young lady    who lived long ago and acquired eternal fame by dropping out of the    procession and never getting back again. Well, Mary Matilda put this    delicious cake in a beautiful paper collar-box and sent it in all    haste to her brother and his two friends in the far-off country.    Great was Slosson's joy upon receiving this palatable boon, and great    was the joy of his two friends, who it must be confessed were on the    very brink of starvation. The messages Mary Matilda received from the    grateful young men, who owed their rescue to her, must have pleased    her, although the consciousness of a noble deed is better than words    of praise.      But one day Mary Matilda got another letter from her brother Slosson    which plunged her into profound melancholy. \"Weep with me, dear    Sister,\" he wrote, \"for one of my companions, Juan, has left me. He    was the youngest, and I fear some great misfortune has befallen him,    for he was ever brooding over the mystery of his lineage. Yesterday    he left us and we have not seen him since. He took my lavender    trousers with him.\"      As you may easily suppose, Mary Matilda was much cast down by this    fell intelligence. She drooped like a blighted lily and wept.      \"What can ail our Mary Matilda?\" queried her mother. \"The roses have    vanished from her cheeks, the fire has gone out of her orbs, and her    step has lost its old-time cunning. I am much worried about her.\"      They all noticed her changed appearance. Even Eddie Martin, the    herculean wood-sawyer, observed the dejection with which the    sorrow-stricken maiden emerged from the house and handed him his    noontide rations of nutcakes and buttermilk. But Mary Matilda spoke    of the causes of her woe to none of them. In silence she brooded over    the mystery of Juan's disappearance.    [Illustration: THE PRINCE ASKING EDDIE MARTIN ABOUT THE FAIR MARY  MATILD.]      When the winter came and the soft, fair snow lay ten or twelve feet    deep on the level on the forest and stream, on wold and woodland,    little Bessie once asked Mary Matilda if she would not take her out    for a walk. Now little Bessie was Mary Matilda's niece, and she was    such a sweet little girl that Mary Matilda could never say \"no\" to    anything she asked.      \"Yes, Bessie,\" said Mary Matilda, \"if you will bundle up nice and warm    I will take you out for a short walk of twenty or thirty miles.\"      So Bessie bundled up nice and warm. Then Mary Matilda went out on the    porch and launched her two snow-shoes and got into them and harnessed    them to her tiny feet.      \"Where are you going?\" asked Eddie Martin, pausing in his work and    leaning his saw against a slab of green maple.      \"I am going to take Bessie out for a short walk,\" replied Mary    Matilda.      \"Are you not afraid to go alone?\" said Eddie Martin. \"You know the    musquashes are very thick, and this spell of winter weather has made    them very hungry and ferocious.\"      \"No, I am not afraid of the musquashes,\" replied Mary Matilda. But    she _was_ afraid of them: only she did not want "]]]
