The  King thanked the Bishop for his choice of the lesson; but he was  surprised and gratified to learn that it was the lesson for the day  according to the calendar.        [4] The day was so piercing that the king, at the persuasion of      Bishop Juxon, wore a cloak till the moment of his death.    About ten o'clock Colonel Hacker knocked at the King's chamber door,  and, being admitted by Herbert, came in trembling, and announced to the  King that it was time to go to Whitehall, where he might have further  time to rest; and soon afterwards the King, taking the Bishop by the  hand proposed to go. Charles then walked out through the garden of the  palace into the Park, where several companies of foot waited as his  guard; and, attended by the Bishop on one side, and Colonel Tomlinson on  the other, both bare-headed, he walked fast down the Park, sometimes  cheerfully calling on the guard to \"march apace.\" As he went along, he  said, \"he now went to strive for an heavenly crown, with less solicitude  than he had often encouraged his soldiers to fight for an earthly  diadem.\"    At the end of the Park, the King[5] went up the stairs leading to the  long gallery, and so into the Cabinet Chamber of the Palace of  Whitehall. Being delayed here in consequence of the scaffold not being  ready, he offered up several prayers, and entered into religious  discourse with the Bishop. About twelve he ate some bread, and drank a  glass of claret, declining to dine after he had received the sacrament.        [5] The late Sir Henry Englefield related a traditional      anecdote, that Charles, in passing through the Park, pointed out      a tree near the entrance from Spring Gardens (where the cows at      present stand,) saying, \"That tree was planted by brother      Henry.\"    When Charles arrived at Whitehall, the Colonels Hacker, Huncks, and  Phayer produced to Tomlinson the warrant for his execution; and in the  Horn Chamber the King was delivered by Tomlinson into the custody of  those officers; Charles requested Tomlinson, however, to remain with him  to the last, and acknowledged his kind and respectful conduct by  presenting to him a gold toothpicker and case which he carried in his  pocket. Tomlinson also introduced to him Mr. Seymour, who brought a  letter from the Prince to his father, with whom the King conversed, and  charged him with various messages for the Prince.    In the mean time a different scene was passing in Ireton's chamber, a  small room in another part of the palace. Ireton and Harrison were here  in bed; and Cromwell, Axtell, Huncks, Hacker, and Phayer were present.  Cromwell commanded Huncks to draw up an order to the executioner  pursuant to the warrant for the King's execution. Huncks refused;  whereupon Cromwell was highly incensed, and called him a peevish,  froward fellow; and Axtell exclaimed, \"Colonel Huncks, I am ashamed of  you:--the ship is now coming into the harbour, and will you strike sail  before we come to anchor?\" Cromwell then went to a table, and, as it  would appear, wrote the order to the executioner, and then gave the pen  to Hacker, who, as one of the officers charged with the execution of the  warrant, signed it.[6] Cromwell, and the rest of the officers, then went  out of the chamber, and, in a few minutes, Hacker came and knocked at  the door of the chamber where the King was, with Tomlinson, the Bishop,  Herbert, and some of his guards. Herbert and the Bishop were deeply  affected at this signal for their final separation from their sovereign  and master. The King stretched out his hand to them, which they kissed,  falling on their knees and weeping, the King helping the aged bishop to  rise. He then bade Hacker to open the door and he would follow; and he  was conducted by Hacker, Tomlinson, and other officers and soldiers,  through the banquetting house by a passage broken through the wall,  where the centre window now is. The street now called Parliament Street  was at that time crossed by two ranges of buildings belonging to the  palace of Whitehall, with wide arched gateways crossing the street, and  forming the public thoroughfare. One gateway was opposite to Privy  Gardens; and there was a way over it from these gardens belonging to the  palace, to pass into St. James's Park. The other building traversing the  street was the sumptuous gallery of Whitehall, built by Henry VIII., the  scene of so many adventures and events of various descriptions in the  reigns of Elizabeth, James, and the two Charles's. Connected with this  gallery was \"a beautiful gatehouse,\" over a noble archway. Lord  Leicester says, in his Journal (p. 60.),--\"The scaffold was erected  between Whitehall gate and the gallery leading to St. James's.\" Lilly  asserts, that it was just at the spot where the blood of a citizen had  been shed at the commencement of the rebellion, when a mob were  vociferating \"_No Bishop_\" under the windows of the palace, and some  cavaliers sallied out to disperse them, and one was killed. A strong  guard of several regiments of horse and foot being posted about the  scaffold, so that the people could not approach near enough to hear any  discourse from the King, he addressed his last sentences chiefly to the  Bishop, Colonel Tomlinson, and the other officers who stood near him.        [6] See the evidence on the trials of Hacker, Axtell, and Hulet,      State Trials, vol. v.    \"_The Bishop._ Though your Majesty's affections may be very well known  as to religion; yet it may be expected that you should say something  thereof for the world's satisfaction.\"    \"_The King._ I thank you heartily, my Lord, for that I had almost  forgotten it. In troth, Sirs, my conscience in religion, I think, is  very well known to all the world; and therefore I declare before you all  that I die a Christian, according to the profession of the Church of  England, as I found it left me by my father; and this honest man, I  think, will witness it.\"    Then to Colonel Hacker he said, \"Take care that they do not put me to  pain: and, Sir, this and it please you--\"    But a gentleman coming near the axe, the King said, \"Take heed of the  axe, pray take heed of the axe.\"    Then speaking unto the executioner, he said, \"I shall say but very short  prayers, and when I thrust out my hands--\"    Then turning to the Bishop, he said, \"I have a good cause, and a  gracious God on my side.\"    \"_The Bishop._ There is but one stage more, this stage is turbulent and  troublesome, it is a short one; but you may consider it will soon carry  you a very great way, it will carry you from earth to heaven; and there  you will find a great deal of cordial joy and comfort.\"    \"_The King._ I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown, where no  disturbance can be, no disturbance in the world.\"    \"_The Bishop._ You are exchanged from a temporary to an eternal crown; a  good exchange.\"    Then the King said to the executioner, \"Is my hair well?\" and took off  his cloak and his George, giving his George to the Bishop, saying,  \"Remember.\" Then he put off his doublet, and being in his waistcoat, he  put on his cloak again; then looking upon the block, he said to the  executioner, \"You must set it fast.\"    \"_Executioner._ It is fast, Sir.\"    \"_The King._ When I put out my hands this way (stretching them out),  then--\" After that, having said two or three words to himself, as he  stood with his hands and eyes lift up, immediately stooping down, he  laid his neck upon the block.[7] And then the executioner again putting  his hair under his cap, the King, thinking he was going to strike, said,  \"Stay for the sign.\"        [7] It being doubted whether the king would submit to the      executioner, staples were driven into the block, and hooks      prepared, in order, if necessary, to confine his head forcibly      to the block. On the trial of Hugh Peters in 1660, it was sworn      that this was done by his orders given on the scaffold to one      Tench, a joiner; in Houndsditch. See State Trials, vol. v.    \"_Executioner._ Yes, I will, and please your Majesty.\"--After a little  pause, the King stretching forth his hands, the executioner at one blow  severed his head from his body, and held it up and showed it to the  people, saying, \"Behold the head of a traitor!\" At the instant when the  blow was given, a dismal universal groan was uttered by the people (as  if by one consent) such as was never before heard; and as soon as the  execution was over, one troop of horse marched rapidly from Charing  Cross to King Street, and another from King Street to Charing Cross, to  disperse and scatter the multitude.    Though Joyce and Hugh Peters have been suspected of inflicting the  murderous blow on Charles, and though another claimant for this infamous  distinction is put forward in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1767, there  seems little doubt that Richard Brandon, the common hangman, assisted by  his man, Ralph Jones, a ragman in Rosemary Lane, in fact perpetrated the  deed. Among the tracts relative to the Civil War presented to the  British Museum by George III., in 1762, are three on this subject, which  are fully noticed in a note to Mr. Ellis's Letters on English History,  vol. iii. (second series.) It appears, by the register of Whitechapel  Church, that Richard Brandon was buried there on the 24th of June, 1649;  and a marginal note (not in the hand of the Registrar, but bearing the  mark of antiquity), states, \"This R. Brandon is supposed to have cut off  the head of Charles I.\"--One of the tracts, entitled \"The Confession of  Richard Brandon, the Hangman, upon his Death-bed, concerning the  Beheading of his late Majesty,\" printed in 1649, states, \"During the  time of his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11647"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 458, October 11, 1884 (#5)"],[1,"ORES.    [Footnote: Paper read before the Institution of Mechanical Engineers at  the Cardiff meeting.--_Engineering_.]    By Mr. EDGAR P. RATHBONE, of London.      In the year 1882, while on a visit to some of the great silver mines in  Bolivia, an opportunity was afforded the writer of inspecting a new and  successful process for the treatment of silver ores, the invention of Herr  Francke, a German gentleman long resident in Bolivia, whose acquaintance  the writer had also the pleasure of making. After many years of tedious  working devoted to experiments bearing on the metallurgical treatment of  rich but refractory silver ores, the inventor has successfully introduced  the process of which it is proposed in this paper to give a description,  and which has, by its satisfactory working, entirely eclipsed all other  plans hitherto tried in Bolivia, Peru, and Chili. The Francke \"tina\"  process is based on the same metallurgical principles as the system  described by Alonzo Barba in 1640, and also on those introduced into the  States in more recent times under the name of the Washoe process.[1]    [Footnote 1: Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers,  vol. ii., p. 159.]    It was only after a long and careful study of these two processes, and by  making close observations and experiments on other plans, which had up to  that time been tried with more or less success in Bolivia, Peru, and  Chili--such as the Mexican amalgamation process, technically known as the  \"patio\" process; the improved Freiberg barrel amalgamation process; as  used at Copiapo; and the \"Kronke\" process--that Herr Francke eventually  succeeded in devising his new process, and by its means treating  economically the rich but refractory silver ores, such as those found at  the celebrated Huanchaca and Guadalupe mines in Potosi, Bolivia. In this  description of the process the writer will endeavor to enter into every  possible detail having a practical bearing on the final results; and with  this view he commences with the actual separation of the ores at the  mines.    _Ore Dressing, etc._--This consists simply in the separation of the ore by  hand at the mines into different qualities, by women and boys with small  hammers, the process being that known as \"cobbing\" in Cornwall. The object  of this separation is twofold: first to separate the rich parts from the  poor as they come together in the same lump of ore, otherwise rich pieces  might go undetected; and, secondly, to reduce the whole body of ore coming  from the mine to such convenient size as permits of its being fed directly  into the stamps battery. The reason for this separation not being effected  by those mechanical appliances so common in most ore dressing  establishments, such as stone breakers or crushing rolls, is simply  because the ores are so rich in silver, and frequently of such a brittle  nature, that any undue pulverization would certainly result in a great  loss of silver, as a large amount would be carried away in the form of  fine dust. So much attention is indeed required in this department that it  is found requisite to institute strict superintendence in the sorting or  cobbing sheds, in order to prevent as far as practicable any improper  diminution of the ores. According to the above method, the ores coming  from the mine are classified into the four following divisions:    1. Very rich ore, averaging about six per cent. of silver, or containing  say 2,000 ounces of silver to the ton (of 2,000 lb.).    2. Rich ore, averaging about one per cent. of silver, or say from 300 to  400 ounces of silver to the ton.    3. Ordinary ore, averaging about 1/2 per cent. of silver, or say from 150  oz. to 200 oz. of silver to the ton.    4. Gangue, or waste rock, thrown on the dump heaps.    The first of these qualities--the very rich ore--is so valuable as to  render advantageous its direct export in the raw state to the coast for  shipment to Europe. The cost of fuel in Bolivia forms so considerable a  charge in smelting operations, that the cost of freight to Europe on very  rich silver ores works out at a relatively insignificant figure, when  compared with the cost of smelting operations in that country. This rich  ore is consequently selected very carefully, and packed up in tough  rawhide bags, so as to make small compact parcels some 18 in. to 2 ft.  long, and 8 in. to 12 in. thick, each containing about 1 cwt. Two of such  bags form a mule load, slung across the animal's back.    The second and third qualities of ore are taken direct to the smelting  works; and where these are situated at some distance from the mines, as at  Huanchaca and Guadalupe, the transport is effected by means of strong but  lightly built iron carts, specially constructed to meet the heavy wear and  tear consequent upon the rough mountain roads. These two classes of ores  are either treated separately, or mixed together in such proportion as is  found by experience to be most suitable for the smelting process.    On its arrival at the reduction works the ore is taken direct to the stamp  mill. At the Huanchaca works there are sixty-five heads of stamps, each  head weighing about 500 lb., with five heads in each battery, and crushing  about 50 cwt. per head per twenty-four hours. The ore is stamped dry,  without water, requiring no coffers; this is a decided advantage as  regards first cost, owing to the great weight of the coffers, from 2 to 3  tons--a very heavy item when the cost of transport from Europe at about  50_l_. per ton is considered. As fast as the ore is stamped, it is  shoveled out by hand, and thrown upon inclined sieves of forty holes per  lineal inch; the stuff which will not pass through the mesh is returned to  the stamps.    Dry stamping may be said to be almost a necessity in dealing with these  rich silver ores, as with the employment of water there is a great loss of  silver, owing to the finer particles being carried away in suspension, and  thus getting mixed with the slimes, from which it is exceedingly difficult  to recover them, especially in those remote regions where the cost of  maintaining large ore-dressing establishments is very heavy. Dry stamping,  however, presents many serious drawbacks, some of which could probably be  eliminated if they received proper attention. For instance, the very fine  dust, which rises in a dense cloud during the operation of stamping, not  only settles down on all parts of the machinery, interfering with its  proper working, so that some part of the battery is nearly always stopped  for repairs, but is also the cause of serious inconvenience to the  workmen. At the Huanchaca mines, owing to the presence of galena or  sulphide of lead in the ores, this fine dust is of such an injurious  character as not unfrequently to cause the death of the workmen; as a  precautionary measure they are accustomed to stuff cotton wool into their  nostrils. This, however, is only a partial preventive; and the men find  the best method of overcoming the evil effect is to return to their homes  at intervals of a few weeks, their places being taken by others for the  same periods. In dry stamping there is also a considerable loss of silver  in the fine particles of rich ore which are carried away as dust and  irrevocably lost. To prevent this loss, the writer proposed while at  Huanchaca that a chamber should be constructed, into which all the fine  dust might be exhausted or blown by a powerful fan or ventilator.    _Roasting_.--From the stamps the stamped ore is taken in small ore cars to  the roasting furnaces, which are double bedded in design, one hearth being  built immediately above the other. This type of furnace has proved, after  various trials, to be that best suited for the treatment of the Bolivian  silver ores, and is stated to have been found the most economical as  regards consumption of fuel, and to give the least trouble in labor.    At the Huanchaca mines these furnaces cost about 100_l_. each, and are  capable of roasting from 2 to 21/2 tons of ore in twenty-four hours, the  quantity and cost of the fuel consumed being as follows:                                      Bolivian dollars at 3s. 1d.  Tola (a kind of shrub), 3 cwt., at 60 cents.   1.80  Yareta (a resinous moss), 4 cwt., at 80 cents. 3.20  Torba (turf), 10 cwt., at 40 cents.            4.00                                                 ----                         Bolivian dollars.       9.00, say 28s.    One man can attend to two furnaces, and earns 3s. per shift of twelve  hours.    Probably no revolving mechanical furnace is suited to the roasting of  these ores, as the operation requires to be carefully and intelligently  watched, for it is essential to the success of the Francke process that  the ores should not be completely or \"dead\" roasted, inasmuch as certain  salts, prejudicial to the ultimate proper working of the process, are  liable to be formed if the roasting be too protracted. These salts are  mainly due to the presence of antimony, zinc, lead, and arsenic, all of  which are unfavorable to amalgamation.    The ores are roasted with 8 per cent. of salt, or 400 lb. of salt for the  charge of 21/2 tons of ore; the salt costs 70 cents, or 2s. 2d. per 100 lb.  So roasted the ores are only partially chlorinized, and their complete  chlorination is effected subsequently, during the process of amalgamation;  the chlorides are thus formed progressively as required, and, in fact, it  would almost appear that the success of the process virtually consists in  obviating the formation of injurious salts. All the sulphide ores in  Bolivia contain sufficient copper to form the quantity of cuprous chloride  requisite for the first stages of roasting, in order to render the silver  contained in the ore thoroughly amenable to subsequent amalgamation.    _Amalgamating_.--From the furnaces the roasted ore is taken in ore cars to  large hoppers or"]]]
