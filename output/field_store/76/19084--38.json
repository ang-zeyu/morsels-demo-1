[Sidenote:--2--] The _casus belli_ lay in the confiscation of the  money which Claudius had given to the foremost Britons,--Decianus Catus,  governor of the island, announcing that this must now be sent back. This  was one reason [Lacuna] [Footnote: It would seem natural to supply \"for the  uprising,\" as does Reiske.] and another was that Seneca had lent them on  excellent terms as regards interest a thousand myriads that they did not  want, [Footnote: The meaning of this phrase ( [Greek: achousin]) is not  wholly clear. Naber purposes to substitute [Greek: aitousin] (\"that they  were asking for\").] and had afterward called in this loan all at once and  levied on them for it with severity. But the person who most stirred their  spirits and persuaded them to fight the Romans, who was deemed worthy to  stand at their head and to have the conduct of the entire war, was a  British woman, Buduica, [Footnote: Known commonly as Boadicea.] of the  royal family and possessed of greater judgment than often belongs to  women. It was she who gathered the army to the number of nearly twelve  myriads and ascended a tribunal of marshy soil made after the Roman  fashion. In person she was very tall, with a most sturdy figure and a  piercing glance; her voice was harsh; a great mass of yellow hair fell  below her waist and a large golden necklace clasped her throat; wound  about her was a tunic of every conceivable color and over it a thick  chlamys had been fastened with a brooch. This was her constant attire. She  now grasped a spear to aid her in terrifying all beholders and spoke as  follows:--    [Sidenote:--3--] \"You have had actual experience of the difference between  freedom and slavery. Hence, though some of you previously through  ignorance of which was better may have been deceived by the alluring  announcements of the Romans, yet now that you have tried both you have  learned how great a mistake you made by preferring a self-imposed  despotism to your ancestral mode of life. You have come to recognize how  far superior is the poverty of independence to wealth in servitude. What  treatment have we met with that is not most outrageous, that is not most  grievous, ever since these men insinuated themselves into Britain? Have we  not been deprived of our most numerous and our greatest possessions  entire, while for what remains we must pay taxes? Besides pasturing and  tilling all the various regions for them do we not contribute a yearly sum  for our very bodies? How much better it would have been to be sold to  masters once and for all than to ransom ourselves annually and possess  empty names of freedom! How much better to have been slain and perish  rather than go about with subservient heads! Yet what have I said? Even  dying is not free from expense among them, and you know what fees we  deposit on behalf of the dead. Throughout the rest of mankind death frees  even those who are in slavery; only in the case of the Romans do the very  dead live for their profit. Why is it that though none of us has any  money,--and how or whence should we get it?,--we are stripped and  despoiled like a murderer's victims? How should the Romans grow milder in  process of time, when they have conducted themselves so toward us at the  very start,--a period when all men show consideration for even newly  captured beasts?    [Sidenote:--4--] \"But, to tell the truth, it is we who have made ourselves  responsible for all these evils in allowing them so much as to set foot on  the island in the first place instead of expelling them at once as we did  their famous Julius Caesar,--yes, in not making the idea of attempting the  voyage formidable to them, while they were as yet far off, as it was to  Augustus and to Gaius Caligula. So great an island, or rather in one sense  a continent encircled by water, do we inhabit, a veritable world of our  own, and so far are we separated by the ocean from all the rest of mankind  that we have been believed to dwell on a different earth and under a  different sky and some of their wisest men were not previously sure of  even our exact name. Yet for all this we have been scorned and trampled  under foot by men who know naught else than how to secure gain. Still, let  us even at this late day, if not before, fellow-citizens, friends and  relatives,--for I deem you all relatives, in that you inhabit a single  island and are called by [Footnote: Reading [Greek: chechlaemenous](van  Herwerden).] one common name,--let us do our duty while the memory of  freedom still abides within us, that we may leave both the name and the  fact of it to our children. For if we utterly lose sight of the happy  conditions amid which we were born and bred, what pray will they do,  reared in bondage?    [Sidenote:--5--] \"This I say not to inspire you with a hatred of present  circumstances,--that hatred is already apparent,--nor with a fear of the  future,--that fear you already have,--but to commend you because of your  own accord you choose to do just what you ought, and to thank you for  cooperating so readily with me and your own selves at once. Be nowise  afraid of the Romans. They are not more numerous than are we nor yet  braver. And the proof is that they have protected themselves with helmets  and breastplates and greaves and furthermore have equipped their camps  with palisades and walls and ditches to make sure that they shall suffer  no harm by any hostile assault. [Footnote: Corruptions in the text emended  by Reiske.] Their fears impel them to choose this method rather than  engage in any active work like us. We enjoy such a superabundance of  bravery that we regard tents as safer than walls and our shields as  affording greater protection than their whole suits of mail. As a  consequence, we when victorious can capture them and when overcome by  force can elude them. And should we ever choose to retreat, we can conceal  ourselves in swamps and mountains so inaccessible that we can be neither  found nor taken. The enemy, however, can neither pursue any one by reason  of their heavy armor nor yet flee. And if they ever should slip away from  us, taking refuge in certain designated spots, there, too, they are sure  to be enclosed as in a trap. These are some of the respects in which they  are vastly inferior to us, and others are their inability to bear up under  hunger, thirst, cold, or heat, as we can; for they require shade and  protection, they require kneaded bread and wine and oil, and if the supply  of any of these things fails them they simply perish. For us, on the other  hand, any root or grass serves as bread, any plant juice as olive oil, any  water as wine, any tree as a house. Indeed, this very region is to us an  acquaintance and ally, but to them unknown and hostile. As for the rivers,  we swim them naked, but they even with boats can not cross easily. Let us  therefore go against them trusting boldly to good fortune. Let us show  them that they are hares and foxes trying to rule dogs and wolves.\"    [Sidenote:--6--] At these words, employing a species of divination, she  let a hare escape from her bosom, and as it ran in what they considered a  lucky direction, the whole multitude shouted with pleasure, and Buduica  raising her hand to heaven, spoke: \"I thank thee, Andraste, [Footnote: Not  much information is preserved regarding this indigenous goddess of  Britain. Reimar asserts that she is practically identical with Boccharte,  Astarte, or Venus.] and call upon thee, who are a woman, being myself also  a woman that rules not burden-bearing Egyptians like Nitocris, nor  merchant Assyrians like Semiramis (of these things we have heard from the  Romans), nor even the Romans themselves, as did Messalina first and later  Agrippina;--at present their chief is Nero, in name a man, in fact a  woman, as is shown by his singing, his playing the cithara, his adorning  himself:--but ruling as I do men of Britain that know not how to till the  soil or ply a trade yet are thoroughly versed in the arts of war and hold  all things common, even children and wives; wherefore the latter possess  the same valor as the males: being therefore queen of such men and such  women I supplicate and pray thee for victory and salvation and liberty  against men insolent, unjust, insatiable, impious,--if, indeed we ought to  term those creatures men who wash in warm water, eat artificial dainties,  drink unmixed wine, anoint themselves with myrrh, sleep on soft couches  with boys for bedfellows (and past their prime at that), are slaves to a  zither-player, yes, an inferior zither-player. Wherefore may this  Domitia-Nero _woman_ reign no more over you or over me: let the wench  sing and play the despot over the Romans. They surely deserve to be in  slavery to such a being whose tyranny they have patiently borne already  this long time. But may we, mistress, ever look to thee alone as our  head.\"    [Sidenote:--7--] After an harangue of this general nature Buduica led her  army against the Romans. The latter chanced to be without a leader for the  reason that Paulinus their commander had gone on an expedition to Mona, an  island near Britain. This enabled her to sack and plunder two Roman  cities, and, as I said, she wrought indescribable slaughter. Persons  captured by the Britons underwent every form of most frightful treatment.  The conquerors committed the most atrocious and bestial outrages. For  instance, they hung up naked the noblest and most distinguished women, cut  off their breasts and sewed them to their mouths, to make the victims  appear to be eating them. After that they impaled them on sharp skewers  run perpendicularly the whole length of the body. All this they did to the  accompaniment"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10891"],[0,"Algonquin Indian Tales (#5)"],[1,"been for a pleasant outing of an hour or so.    \"Well, Mary,\" would be the greeting of her mistress, while Mary's quiet  response would be the Indian greeting of, \"Wat cheer!\"    Then things would go on as usual for perhaps another six months, when Mary  would indulge again in one of her tantrums, with the same happy results.    She dressed the children in picturesque Indian costumes--coats, dresses,  leggings, moccasins, and other articles of apparel of deer skin, tanned as  soft as kid, and beautifully embroidered with silk and bead work. Not a  spot could appear upon their garments without Mary's notice, and as she  always kept changes ready she was frequently disrobing and dressing them  up.    When Souwanas and Jakoos came that morning and picked up the children Mary  happened to be in another room. Had she been present she would doubtless  have interfered in their movements. As it was, when she missed the children  her indignation knew no bounds, and only the most emphatic commands of her  mistress restrained her from rushing after them. All day long she had to  content herself with muttering her protests while, as usual, she was busily  employed with her needle. When, however, the two stalwart Indians returned  in the evening with the children on their shoulders the storm broke, and  Mary's murmurings, at first mere protests, became loud and furious when the  happy children, so tired and dirty, were set down before her. The Indians,  knowing of the sad tragedy in Mary's life, would not show anger or even  annoyance under her scathing words, but, with the stoical nature of their  race, they quietly endured her wrath. This they were much better prepared  to do since neither of the parents of the white children seemed in the  slightest degree disturbed by their long absence or the tirade of the  indignant nurse. With high-bred courtesy they patiently listened to all  that Mary had to say, and when the storm had spent itself they turned and  noiselessly retired.    The children were worn out with their day's adventure, and their mother  intimated that Mary ought at once to bathe them and put them to bed. This,  however, did not satisfy Mary. It had become her custom to dress them up in  the afternoons and keep them appareled in their brightest costumes during  the rest of the day; therefore now the weary children, after being bathed,  were again dressed in their best and brought out for inspection and a light  supper before retiring. The bath and the supper had so refreshed them that  when Mary had tucked them into their beds they were wide awake and asked  her to tell them a story. But sleep was what they needed now more than  anything else, and she tried to quiet them without any further words, but  so thoroughly aroused were they that they declared that if she refused they  knew somebody who would be glad to have them visit him again, and that he  would tell them lots of beautiful things.    This hint that they might return to the wigwam of Souwanas was too much for  Mary, who very freely gave utterance to her sentiments about him. The  children gallantly came to the defense of the old Indian and also of  Nanahboozhoo, of whom Mary spoke most slightingly, saying that he was a  mean fellow who ought to be ashamed of many of his tricks.    \"Well,\" replied Sagastao, \"if you will tell us better stories than those  Souwanas can tell us about Nanahboozhoo, all right, we will listen to them.  But, mind you, we are going to hear his Nanahboozhoo stories too.\"    \"O, indeed,\" said Mary, with a contemptuous toss of her head, \"there are  many stories better than those of his old Nanahboozhoo.\"    \"Won't it be fun to see whose stories we like the best, Mary's or  Souwanas's!\" said Minnehaha, who foresaw an interesting rivalry.    Mary had now committed herself, and so, almost without realizing what it  would come to, she found herself pitted against Souwanas, the great  story-teller of the tribe. However, being determined that Souwanas should  not rob her of the love of the children, she was tempted to begin her  story-telling even though the children were exhausted, and so it was that  when the lad asked a question Mary was ready.    \"Say, Mary,\" said Sagastao, \"the mosquitoes bit us badly to-day. Do you  know why it is that there are such troublesome little things? Is there any  story about them?\"    \"Yes. Wakonda, one of the strange spirits, sent them,\" said Mary, \"because  a woman was lazy and would not keep the clothes of her husband and children  clean and nice.\"    \"Tell us all about it,\" they both cried out.    Mary quieted them, and began the story.    \"Long ago, when the people all dressed in deerskins, there was a man whose  name was Pug-a-mah-kon. He was an industrious fellow, and had often to work  a good deal in dirty places. The result was that, although he had several  suits of clothes, he seemed never to have any clean ones.    \"It was the duty of his wife to scrape and clean his garments and wash and  resmoke them as often as they needed it. But she neglected her work and  would go off gossiping among her neighbors. Her husband was patient with  her for a time, but at length, when he heard that Wakonda was coming to  pay a visit to the people, to see how they were getting along, he began to  bestir himself so as to be decently attired, in clean, handsome apparel, to  meet this powerful being, who was able to confer great favors on him, or,  if ill-disposed, to injure him greatly.    \"He endeavored to get his wife to go to work and remove the dirt that had  gathered on his garments. She was so lazy that it was only from fear of a  beating that she ever did make any attempt to do as he desired. She took  the garments and began to clean them, but she was in a bad humor and did  her work in such a slovenly and half-hearted way that there was but very  little change for the better after the pretended cleaning.    \"When the news was circulated that Wakonda was coming, the husband prepared  to dress himself in his best apparel, but great indeed was his anger and  disgust when he found that the garments which he had hoped to wear were  still disgracefully grimy.    \"While the angry husband was chiding the woman for her indolence Wakonda  suddenly appeared. To him the man appealed, and asked for his advice in the  matter.    \"Wakonda quickly responded, and said: 'A lazy, gossiping wife is not only a  disgrace to her husband, she is annoying to all around her; and so it will  be in this case.'    \"Then Wakonda told her husband to take some of the dirt which still clung  to his garments, which she was supposed to have cleansed, and to throw it  at her. This the man did, and the particles of dirt at once changed into  mosquitoes. And so, ever since, especially in the warm days and nights of  early summer when the mosquitoes with their singing and stinging come  around to trouble us, we are reminded of this lazy, slovenly woman, who was  not only a trial to her husband, but by her lack of industry and care  brought such a scourge upon all the people.\"    \"Didn't Wakonda do anything else?\" murmured the little lad; but that  blessed thing called sleep now enfolded both the little ones, and with  mutterings of \"Nanahboozhoo--Wakonda--Souwanas--Mary\"--they were soon far  away in childhood's happy dreamland.          CHAPTER III.      More about Mary and the Children--Minnehaha Stung by  the Bees--How the Bees Got Their Stings--What Happened  to the Bears that Tried to Steal the Honey.    The next morning while Mary was dressing them the children told her of  their adventures in the wigwam of the Indians. Mary was really interested,  though she pretended to be disgusted at the whole thing, and professed, in  her Indian way, to be quite shocked when they both confidentially informed  her that they had had such a good time that they were going again even if  they had to run away and be whipped for it.    This was terrible news for Mary, and placed her in an awkward position. To  tell the parents of the children's resolve was something she would never  do, as it might bring down upon them some of the punishment which was quite  contrary to her principles. Yet, on the other hand, to let them go and to  give no information might cause more trouble than she liked to think of.    Neither could she bear the thought of the two children returning from  another day's outing with their neat clothing and pretty faces soiled and  dirty. Do as they might, she had never once informed on them, and she had  no mind to begin now. She earnestly pleaded with them not to carry out  their resolve. The little ones were shrewd enough to see that they had  thoroughly alarmed her, and they were in no hurry to surrender the power  which they saw they had over her.    Mary never said a word in English. She understood a good deal that others  said, but she never expressed herself in other than the Indian language.  Hence both little Sagastao and Minnehaha always talked with her in her own  tongue.    Minnehaha, seeing Mary's anxiety at their determination to run away to the  Indians, thought of compromising the matter by insisting that Mary should  tell them more tales. If she would do this they \"would not run away very  soon;\" especially did she emphasize the \"very soon.\" This was hardly  satisfactory to Mary, but as it was the best promise she could get she was  obliged to consent.    Little Sagastao, who was Mary's favorite, once more unsettled her when he  said, \"Now, Mary, remember, we have only promised not to run away very  soon. That means that we intend to do it some time.\"    It seems that the little conspirators had talked it all over in the morning  in their beds, and had decided how they would get stories out of Mary  without really promising not to run away to the wigwam of Souwanas.    The children, being dressed, were taken down by Mary to prayers and  breakfast, after which an hour was allowed in summer-time for outdoor"]]]
