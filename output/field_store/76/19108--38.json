The forms of the vessels are the same as have  remained typical of Chinese pottery, and of Far Eastern pottery in  general. To that extent the Lung-shan culture may be described as one of  the direct predecessors of the later Chinese civilization.    As in the West, we find in Lung-shan much grey pottery out of which  vessels for everyday use were produced. This simple corded or matted  ware seems to be in connection with Tunguse people who lived in the  north-east. The people of the Lung-shan culture lived on mounds produced  by repeated building on the ruins of earlier settlements, as did the  inhabitants of the \"Tells\" in the Near East. They were therefore a  long-settled population of agriculturists. Their houses were of mud, and  their villages were surrounded with mud walls. There are signs that  their society was stratified. So far as is known at present, this  culture was spread over the present provinces of Shantung, Kiangsu,  Chekiang, and Anhui, and some specimens of its pottery went as far as  Honan and Shansi, into the region of the painted pottery. This culture  lasted in the east until about 1600 B.C., with clear evidence of rather  longer duration only in the south. As black pottery of a similar  character occurs also in the Near East, some authors believe that it has  been introduced into the Far East by another migration (Pontic  migration) following that migration which supposedly brought the painted  pottery. This theory has not been generally accepted because of the fact  that typical black pottery is limited to the plains of East China; if it  had been brought in from the West, we should expect to find it in  considerable amounts also in West China. Ordinary black pottery can be  simply the result of a special temperature in the pottery kiln; such  pottery can be found almost everywhere. The typical thin, fine black  pottery of Lung-shan, however, is in the Far East an eastern element,  and migrants would have had to pass through the area of the painted  pottery people without leaving many traces and without pushing their  predecessors to the East. On the basis of our present knowledge we  assume that the peoples of the Lung-shan culture were probably of Tai  and Yao stocks together with some Tunguses.    Recently, a culture of mound-dwellers in Eastern China has been  discovered, and a southern Chinese culture of people with impressed or  stamped pottery. This latter seems to be connected with the Yueeh tribes.  As yet, no further details are known.    8 _The first petty States in Shansi_    At the time in which, according to archaeological research, the painted  pottery flourished in West China, Chinese historical tradition has it  that the semi-historical rulers, Yao and Shun, and the first official  dynasty, the Hsia dynasty ruled over parts of China with a centre in  southern Shansi. While we dismiss as political myths the Confucianist  stories representing Yao and Shun as models of virtuous rulers, it may  be that a small state existed in south-western Shansi under a chieftain  Yao, and farther to the east another small state under a chieftain Shun,  and that these states warred against each other until Yao's state was  destroyed. These first small states may have existed around 2000 B.C.    On the cultural scene we first find an important element of progress:  bronze, in traces in the middle layers of the Yang-shao culture, about  1800 B.C.; that element had become very widespread by 1400 B.C. The  forms of the oldest weapons and their ornamentation show similarities  with weapons from Siberia; and both mythology and other indications  suggest that the bronze came into China from the north and was not  produced in China proper. Thus, from the present state of our knowledge,  it seems most correct to say that the bronze was brought to the Far East  through the agency of peoples living north of China, such as the Turkish  tribes who in historical times were China's northern neighbours (or  perhaps only individual families or clans, the so-called smith families  with whom we meet later in Turkish tradition), reaching the Chinese  either through these people themselves or through the further agency of  Mongols. At first the forms of the weapons were left unaltered. The  bronze vessels, however, which made their appearance about 1450 B.C. are  entirely different from anything produced in other parts of Asia; their  ornamentation shows, on the one hand, elements of the so-called \"animal  style\" which is typical of the steppe people of the Ordos area and of  Central Asia. But most of the other elements, especially the \"filling\"  between stylized designs, is recognizably southern (probably of the Tai  culture), no doubt first applied to wooden vessels and vessels made from  gourds, and then transferred to bronze. This implies that the art of  casting bronze very soon spread from North China, where it was first  practiced by Turkish peoples, to the east and south, which quickly  developed bronze industries of their own. There are few deposits of  copper and tin in North China, while in South China both metals are  plentiful and easily extracted, so that a trade in bronze from south to  north soon set in.    The origin of the Hsia state may have been a consequence of the progress  due to bronze. The Chinese tradition speaks of the Hsia _dynasty_, but  can say scarcely anything about it. The excavations, too, yield no  clear conclusions, so that we can only say that it flourished at the  time and in the area in which the painted pottery occurred, with a  centre in south-west Shansi. We date this dynasty now somewhere between  2000 and 1600 B.C. and believe that it was an agrarian culture with  bronze weapons and pottery vessels but without the knowledge of the art  of writing.        Chapter Two      THE SHANG DYNASTY (_c_. 1600-1028 B.C.)    1 _Period, origin, material culture_    About 1600 B.C. we come at last into the realm of history. Of the Shang  dynasty, which now followed, we have knowledge both from later texts and  from excavations and the documents they have brought to light. The Shang  civilization, an evident off-shoot of the Lung-shan culture (Tai, Yao,  and Tunguses), but also with elements of the Hsia culture (with Tibetan  and Mongol and/or Turkish elements), was beyond doubt a high  civilization. Of the origin of the Shang _State_ we have no details, nor  do we know how the Hsia culture passed into the Shang culture.    The central territory of the Shang realm lay in north-western Honan,  alongside the Shansi mountains and extending into the plains. It was a  peasant civilization with towns. One of these towns has been excavated.  It adjoined the site of the present town of Anyang, in the province of  Honan. The town, the Shang capital from _c_. 1300 to 1028 B.C., was  probably surrounded by a mud wall, as were the settlements of the  Lung-shan people. In the centre was what evidently was the ruler's  palace. Round this were houses probably inhabited by artisans; for the  artisans formed a sort of intermediate class, as dependents of the  ruling class. From inscriptions we know that the Shang had, in addition  to their capital, at least two other large cities and many smaller  town-like settlements and villages. The rectangular houses were built in  a style still found in Chinese houses, except that their front did not  always face south as is now the general rule. The Shang buried their  kings in large, subterranean, cross-shaped tombs outside the city, and  many implements, animals and human sacrifices were buried together with  them. The custom of large burial mounds, which later became typical of  the Chou dynasty, did not yet exist.    The Shang had sculptures in stone, an art which later more or less  completely disappeared and which was resuscitated only in post-Christian  times under the influence of Indian Buddhism. Yet, Shang culture cannot  well be called a \"megalithic\" culture. Bronze implements and especially  bronze vessels were cast in the town. We even know the trade marks of  some famous bronze founders. The bronze weapons are still similar to  those from Siberia, and are often ornamented in the so-called \"animal  style\", which was used among all the nomad peoples between the Ordos  region and Siberia until the beginning of the Christian era. On the  other hand, the famous bronze vessels are more of southern type, and  reveal an advanced technique that has scarcely been excelled since.  There can be no doubt that the bronze vessels were used for religious  service and not for everyday life. For everyday use there were  earthenware vessels. Even in the middle of the first millennium B.C.,  bronze was exceedingly dear, as we know from the records of prices.  China has always suffered from scarcity of metal. For that reason metal  was accumulated as capital, entailing a further rise in prices; when  prices had reached a sufficient height, the stocks were thrown on the  market and prices fell again. Later, when there was a metal coinage,  this cycle of inflation and deflation became still clearer. The metal  coinage was of its full nominal value, so that it was possible to coin  money by melting down bronze implements. As the money in circulation was  increased in this way, the value of the currency fell. Then it paid to  turn coin into metal implements. This once more reduced the money in  circulation and increased the value of the remaining coinage. Thus  through the whole course of Chinese history the scarcity of metal and  insufficiency of production of metal continually produced extensive  fluctuations of the stocks and the value of metal, amounting virtually  to an economic law in China. Consequently metal implements were never  universally in use, and vessels were always of earthenware, with the  further result of the early invention of porcelain.

[Illustration: The Camelopard.]      As a live camelopard has been sent to London and another to Paris, the  history and habits of these animals have excited some interest. At a  meeting of the Academy of Sciences in Paris, on the 2nd of July last, M.  Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire observed that naturalists were wrong in supposing  that there was only one species of the camelopard. The animal now in  Paris differs from the Cape of Good Hope species by several essential  anatomical characters, and he proposes to distinguish it by the name of  the _Giraffe of Sennaar_, the country from which it comes. Some natives  of Egypt having come to see the one in Paris in the costume of the  country, the animal gave evident proofs of joy, and loaded them with  caresses. This fact is explained by the circumstance that the Giraffe  has an ardent affection for its Arabian keeper, and that it naturally is  delighted with the sight of the turban and the costume of its keeper.    Some authors have proved the mildness and docility of the camelopard,  while others represent it as incapable of being tamed. This difference  is ascribed by M. Saint-Hilaire to difference of education. Four or  five years ago a male Giraffe, extremely savage, was brought to  Constantinople. The keeper of the present Giraffe had also the charge  of this one, and he ascribes its savageness entirely to the manner in  which it was treated. At the same time M. Mongez read a memoir on the  testimony of ancient authors respecting the Giraffe. Moses is the  first author who speaks of it. As Aristotle does not mention it, M.  Mongez supposes that it was unknown to the Greeks, and that it did not  then exist in Egypt, otherwise Aristotle, who travelled there, must  have known about it. In the year 708 of Rome, Julius Caesar brought  one to Europe, and the Roman emperors afterwards exhibited them at  Rome, either for the games in the circus, or in their triumphs over  the African princes. Albertus Magnus, in his _Treatise de Animalibus_,  is the first modern author who speaks of the Giraffe. In 1486, one of  the Medici family possessed one at Florence, where it lived for a  considerable time.    In its native country the Giraffe browses on the twigs of trees,  preferring plants of the Mimosa genus; but it appears that it can  without inconvenience subsist on other vegetable food. The one kept  at Florence fed on the fruits of the country, and chiefly on apples,  which it begged from the inhabitants of the first storeys of the  houses. The one now in Paris, from its having been accustomed in early  life to the food prepared by the Arabs for their camels, is fed on  mixed grains bruised, such as maize, barley, &c., and it is furnished  with milk for drink morning and evening. It however willingly accepts  fruits and the branches of the acacia which are presented to it. It  seizes the leaves with its long rugous and narrow tongue by rolling it  about them, and seems annoyed when it is obliged to take any thing  from the ground, which it seems to do with difficulty. To accomplish  this it stretches first one, then the other of its long fore-legs  asunder, and it is not till after repeated attempts that it is able to  seize the objects with its lips and tongue.    The pace of the Giraffe is an amble, though when pursued it flies with  extreme rapidity, but the small size of its lungs prevents it from  supporting a lengthened chase. The Giraffe defends itself against the  lion, its principal enemy, with its fore feet, with which it strikes  with such force as often to repulse him. The specimen in the museum at  Paris is about two years and a half old.    The name _Camelo-pardalis_ (camel-leopard) was given by the Romans to  this animal, from a fancied combination of the characters of the camel  and leopard; but its ancient denomination was _Zurapha_, from which  the name Giraffe has been adopted.--_Brewster's Journal_.      _Sugar_.    About 3,700,000 cwt. of sugar are annually imported from the West  Indies.

(_For the Mirror_.)      The fate of one of the sheriffs of this county, in former times,  merits notice, especially as connected with a ruin in the parish of  Eccliscraig, formerly a place of great strength, being erected on a  perpendicular and peninsulated rock, sixty feet above the sea, at the  mouth of a small rivulet. It was built in consequence of a murder  committed in the reign of James the First, and the circumstance  deserves to be recorded, as it affords a specimen of the barbarity of  the times. Melville, sheriff of Kincardineshire, had, by a vigorous  exercise of his authority, rendered himself so very obnoxious to the  barons of the county, that they had made repeated complaints to the  king. On the last of these occasions the king, in a fit of impatience,  happened to say to Barclay, of Mathers, \"I wish that sheriff were  sodden and supped in brue.\" Barclay instantly withdrew, and reported  to his neighbours the king's words, which they resolved literally  to fulfil. Accordingly, the conspirators invited the unsuspecting  Melville to a hunting party in the forest of Garvock; where, having a  fire kindled, and a cauldron of water boiling on it, they rushed to  the spot, stripped the sheriff naked, and threw him headlong into  the boiling vessel: after which, on pretence of fulfilling the royal  mandate, each swallowed a spoonful of the broth. After this cannibal  feast, Barclay, to screen himself from the vengeance of the king,  built this fortress, which before the invention of gunpowder must have  been impregnable. Some of the conspirators were afterwards pardoned.  One of the pardons is said to be still in existence; and the reason  assigned for granting it is, that the conspirator was within the tenth  degree of kin to Macduff, thane of Fife.    CHARLES STUART.             *       *       *       *       *      USE OF HORSE-CHESTNUTS.    (_For the Mirror_.)      These nuts are much used in France and in Switzerland, in whitening  not only of hemp and flax, but also of silk and wool. They contain a  soapy juice, fit for washing of linens and stuffs, for milling of caps  and stockings, &c., and for fulling of stuffs and cloths.    Twenty nuts are sufficient for five quarts of water. They must be first  peeled, which can be done by children, then rasped or dried, and ground  in a malt-mill, or any other common steel mill. The water must be soft,  either rain or river water, for hard well water will by no means do.  When the nuts are rasped or ground, they must be steeped in the water  quite cold, which soon becomes frothy, (as it does with soap,) and then  turns white as milk. It must be well stirred at first with a stick, and  then, after standing some time to settle, must be strained, or poured  off quite clear. Linen washed in this liquor, and afterwards rinsed in  clear running water, takes an agreeable light sky-blue colour. It takes  spots out of both linen and woollen, and never damages or injures the  cloth. Poultry will eat the meal of them, if it is steeped in hot water,  and mixed with an equal quantity of pollard. The nuts also are eat by  some cows, and without hurting their milk; but they are excellent for  horses whose wind is injured.    A.B.           *       *       *       *       *      A FETCH.
