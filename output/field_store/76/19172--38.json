Well, this man. Who is he?\"    \"The Comte de Rochefort.\"    \"The Comte de Rochefort!\"    \"Unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and I don't  know where he is.\"    \"I know, Guitant,\" said Mazarin.    \"Well, then, how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of  information?\"    \"You think,\" resumed Mazarin, \"that Rochefort----\"    \"He was Cardinal Richelieu's creature, my lord. I warn you, however, his  services will cost you something. The cardinal was lavish to his  underlings.\"    \"Yes, yes, Guitant,\" said Mazarin; \"Richelieu was a great man, a very  great man, but he had that defect. Thanks, Guitant; I shall benefit by  your advice this very evening.\"    Here they separated and bidding adieu to Guitant in the court of the  Palais Royal, Mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down  within that inclosure.    It was D'Artagnan, who was waiting for him.    \"Come hither,\" said Mazarin in his softest voice; \"I have an order to  give you.\"    D'Artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase,  soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out.    The cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of  paper wrote some lines upon it, whilst D'Artagnan stood imperturbable,  without showing either impatience or curiosity. He was like a soldierly  automaton, or rather, like a magnificent marionette.    The cardinal folded and sealed his letter.    \"Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" he said, \"you are to take this dispatch to the  Bastile and bring back here the person it concerns. You must take a  carriage and an escort, and guard the prisoner with the greatest care.\"    D'Artagnan took the letter, touched his hat with his hand, turned round  upon his heel like a drill-sergeant, and a moment afterward was heard,  in his dry and monotonous tone, commanding \"Four men and an escort, a  carriage and a horse.\" Five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage  and the horses' shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the  courtyard.          3. Dead Animosities.      D'Artagnan arrived at the Bastile just as it was striking half-past  eight. His visit was announced to the governor, who, on hearing that he  came from the cardinal, went to meet him and received him at the top of  the great flight of steps outside the door. The governor of the Bastile  was Monsieur du Tremblay, the brother of the famous Capuchin, Joseph,  that fearful favorite of Richelieu's, who went by the name of the Gray  Cardinal.    During the period that the Duc de Bassompierre passed in the  Bastile--where he remained for twelve long years--when his companions,  in their dreams of liberty, said to each other: \"As for me, I shall go  out of the prison at such a time,\" and another, at such and such a time,  the duke used to answer, \"As for me, gentlemen, I shall leave only when  Monsieur du Tremblay leaves;\" meaning that at the death of the cardinal  Du Tremblay would certainly lose his place at the Bastile and De  Bassompierre regain his at court.    His prediction was nearly fulfilled, but in a very different way from  that which De Bassompierre supposed; for after the death of Richelieu  everything went on, contrary to expectation, in the same way as before;  and Bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison.    Monsieur du Tremblay received D'Artagnan with extreme politeness and  invited him to sit down with him to supper, of which he was himself  about to partake.    \"I should be delighted to do so,\" was the reply; \"but if I am not  mistaken, the words 'In haste,' are written on the envelope of the  letter which I brought.\"    \"You are right,\" said Du Tremblay. \"Halloo, major! tell them to order  Number 25 to come downstairs.\"    The unhappy wretch who entered the Bastile ceased, as he crossed the  threshold, to be a man--he became a number.    D'Artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys; he remained on horseback,  feeling no inclination to dismount, and sat looking at the bars, at the  buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from  the other side of the moat, but by which he had for twenty years been  awe-struck.    A bell resounded.    \"I must leave you,\" said Du Tremblay; \"I am sent for to sign the release  of a prisoner. I shall be happy to meet you again, sir.\"    \"May the devil annihilate me if I return thy wish!\" murmured D'Artagnan,  smiling as he pronounced the imprecation; \"I declare I feel quite ill  after only being five minutes in the courtyard. Go to! go to! I would  rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of  the Bastile.\"    He had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived. On  seeing him D'Artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise.  The prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the  musketeer.    \"Gentlemen,\" thus D'Artagnan addressed the four musketeers, \"I am  ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner,  and since there are no locks to the carriage, I shall sit beside him.  Monsieur de Lillebonne, lead my horse by the bridle, if you please.\" As  he spoke he dismounted, gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer  and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said, in a voice  perfectly composed, \"To the Palais Royal, at full trot.\"    The carriage drove on and D'Artagnan, availing himself of the darkness  in the archway under which they were passing, threw himself into the  arms of the prisoner.    \"Rochefort!\" he exclaimed; \"you! is it you, indeed? I am not mistaken?\"    \"D'Artagnan!\" cried Rochefort.    \"Ah! my poor friend!\" resumed D'Artagnan, \"not having seen you for four  or five years I concluded you were dead.\"    \"I'faith,\" said Rochefort, \"there's no great difference, I think,  between a dead man and one who has been buried alive; now I have been  buried alive, or very nearly so.\"    \"And for what crime are you imprisoned in the Bastile.\"    \"Do you wish me to speak the truth?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, then, I don't know.\"    \"Have you any suspicion of me, Rochefort?\"    \"No! on the honor of a gentleman; but I cannot be imprisoned for the  reason alleged; it is impossible.\"    \"What reason?\" asked D'Artagnan.    \"For stealing.\"    \"For stealing! you, Rochefort! you are laughing at me.\"    \"I understand. You mean that this demands explanation, do you not?\"    \"I admit it.\"    \"Well, this is what actually took place: One evening after an orgy in  Reinard's apartment at the Tuileries with the Duc d'Harcourt,  Fontrailles, De Rieux and others, the Duc d'Harcourt proposed that we  should go and pull cloaks on the Pont Neuf; that is, you know, a  diversion which the Duc d'Orleans made quite the fashion.\"    \"Were you crazy, Rochefort? at your age!\"    \"No, I was drunk. And yet, since the amusement seemed to me rather tame,  I proposed to Chevalier de Rieux that we should be spectators instead of  actors, and, in order to see to advantage, that we should mount the  bronze horse. No sooner said than done. Thanks to the spurs, which  served as stirrups, in a moment we were perched upon the croupe; we were  well placed and saw everything. Four or five cloaks had already been  lifted, with a dexterity without parallel, and not one of the victims  had dared to say a word, when some fool of a fellow, less patient than  the others, took it into his head to cry out, 'Guard!' and drew upon us  a patrol of archers. Duc d'Harcourt, Fontrailles, and the others  escaped; De Rieux was inclined to do likewise, but I told him they  wouldn't look for us where we were. He wouldn't listen, put his foot on  the spur to get down, the spur broke, he fell with a broken leg, and,  instead of keeping quiet, took to crying out like a gallows-bird. I then  was ready to dismount, but it was too late; I descended into the arms of  the archers. They conducted me to the Chatelet, where I slept soundly,  being very sure that on the next day I should go forth free. The next  day came and passed, the day after, a week; I then wrote to the  cardinal. The same day they came for me and took me to the Bastile. That  was five years ago. Do you believe it was because I committed the  sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind Henry IV.?\"    \"No; you are right, my dear Rochefort, it couldn't be for that; but you  will probably learn the reason soon.\"    \"Ah, indeed! I forgot to ask you--where are you taking me?\"    \"To the cardinal.\"    \"What does he want with me?\"    \"I do not know. I did not even know that you were the person I was sent  to fetch.\"    \"Impossible--you--a favorite of the minister!\"    \"A favorite! no, indeed!\" cried D'Artagnan. \"Ah, my poor friend! I am  just as poor a Gascon as when I saw you at Meung, twenty-two years ago,  you know; alas!\" and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh.    \"Nevertheless, you come as one in authority.\"    \"Because I happened to be in the ante-chamber when the cardinal called  me, by the merest chance. I am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and  have been so these twenty years.\"    \"Then no misfortune has happened to you?\"    \"And what misfortune could happen to me? To quote some Latin verses I  have forgotten, or rather, never knew well, 'the thunderbolt never falls  on the valleys,' and I am a valley, dear Rochefort,--one of the lowliest  of the low.\"    \"Then Mazarin is still Mazarin?\"    \"The same as ever, my friend; it is said that he is married to the  queen.\"    \"Married?\"    \"If not her husband, he is unquestionably her lover.\"    \"You surprise me. Rebuff Buckingham and consent to Mazarin!\"    \"Just like the women,\" replied D'Artagnan, coolly.    \"Like women, not like queens.\"    \"Egad! queens are the weakest of their sex, when it comes to such things  as these.\"    \"And M. de Beaufort--is he still in prison?\"    \"Yes. Why?\"    \"Oh, nothing, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12590"],[0,"The Shadow of the Rope (#5)"],[1,"es;  hardly a tongue was still. On the bench a red-robed magnate and another  in knee-breeches exchanged views upon the enlarged photographs which had  played so prominent a part in the case; in the well the barristers' wigs  nodded or shook over their pink blotters and their quill pens; gentlemen  of the Press sharpened their pencils and indulged in prophecy; and on  their right, between the reporters and the bench, the privileged few,  the literary and theatrical elect, discussed the situation with abnormal  callousness, masking emotion with a childlike cynicism of sentiment and  phrase.    And for once the stranger in their midst, the man with more outward  distinction than any one of them, the unknown man with the snowy hair,  could afford to listen to what they had to say.    \"No chance, my dear man. Not an earthly!\"    \"I'm not so sure of that.\"    \"Will you bet?\"    \"No, hang it! What a beast you are! But I thought the woman was speaking  the truth.\"    \"You heard what the judge said. Where's your corroboration? No, they  ought never to have let her go into the box. I hear she insisted. But it  hasn't saved anybody yet.\"    \"The new law? Then it shows her pluck!\"    \"But not necessarily her innocence, dear boy.\"    Thus one shaven couple. Others had already exhausted the subject.    \"Yes, I finished it down at Westgate last week.\"    \"Satisfied?\"    \"In a way. It depends so much on the cast.\"    \"These actor-managers--what?\"    \"More or less. I must be off. Dining out.\"    \"What! Not going to wait for the end of the fourth act?\"    \"No, I'm late as it is. Ta-ta!\"    The white-haired man was amused. He did not turn round, nor, if he had,  would he have known the retreating gentleman for the most eminent of  living playwrights; but he knew the reason for his sudden retreat. A  hush had fallen, and some one had whispered, \"They're coming!\" The  light-hearted chatter had died away on the word; perhaps it was not so  light-hearted after all. But the alarm was false, there was no sign of  the jury, and the talk rose again, as the wind will in a storm.    \"We shall want a glass when this is over,\" whispered one of the pair who  had argued about the case.    \"And we'll have it, too, old man!\" rejoined his friend.    The white-haired man was grimly interested. So this was the way men  talked while waiting to hear a fellow-creature sentenced to death! It  was worth knowing. And this was what the newspaper men would call a low  buzz--an expectant hush--this animated babble! Yet the air was charged  with emotion, suppressed perhaps, but none the less distinguishable in  every voice. Within earshot a perspiring young pressman was informing  his friends that to come there comfortably you should commit the murder  yourself, then they gave you the Royal Box; but his teeth could be heard  chattering through the feeble felicity. The white-headed listener curled  a contemptuous nostril. They could joke, and yet they could feel! He  himself betrayed neither weakness, but sat waiting patiently and idly  listening, with the same grim jaw and the same inscrutable eye with  which he had watched the prisoner and the jury alternately throughout  the week. And when the latter at last returned, and then the former, it  was the same subtle stare that he again bent upon them both in turn.    The jury had been absent but forty minutes after all; and their  expedition seemed as ill an omen as their nervous and responsible faces.  There was a moment's hush, another moment of prophetic murmurs, and then  a stillness worthy of its subsequent description in every newspaper. The  prisoner was standing in the front of the dock, a female warder upon  either hand. The lightning pencil of the new journalist had its will of  her at last. For Mrs. Minchin had dispensed not only with the chair  which she had occupied all the week, but also with the heavy veil which  she had but partially lifted during her brief sojourn in the  witness-box, and never once in the dock. The veil was now flung back  over the widow's bonnet, peaking and falling like a sable cowl, against  which the unearthly pallor of her face was whiter far then that of the  merely dead, just as mere death was the least part of the fate  confronting her. Yet she had raised her veil to look it fairly in the  face, and the packed assembly marvelled as it gazed.    Was that the face that had been hidden from them all these days? It was  not what they had pictured beneath the proud, defiant carriage of its  concealing veil. Was that the face of a determined murderess?    Beautiful it was not as they saw it then, but the elements of beauty lay  unmistable beneath a white mist of horror and of pain, as a lovely  landscape is still lovely at its worst. The face was a thin but perfect  oval, lengthened a little by depth of chin and height of forehead, as  now also by unnatural emaciation and distress. The mouth was at once  bloodless, sweet, and firm; the eyes of a warm and lustrous brown,  brilliant, eloquent, brave--and hopeless!    Yes, she had no hope herself! It was plain enough at the first glimpse  of the deadly white, uncovered face, in the cruel glare of gas. But it  became plainer still as, with sad, unflinching eyes, she watched and  listened while, for the last time, the jurymen answered to their names.    Now they were done. The foreman shifted nervously in his place. In the  overstrain of the last dread pause, the crowded court felt hotter and  lighter than ever. It seemed to unite the glare of a gin palace with the  temperature of a Turkish bath.    \"Gentlemen, are you greed upon your verdict?\"    \"We are.\"    \"Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?\"    \"Not guilty.\"    There was a simultaneous gasp from a hundred throats--a distinct cry  from some. Then the Clerk of Arraigns was seen to be leaning forward, a  hand to his ear, for the foreman's voice had broken with excitement. And  every soul in court leaned forward too.    But this time his feelings had a different effect upon the excited  foreman.    \"_Not_ guilty!\" he almost bawled.    Dead silence then, while the clock ticked thrice.    \"And that is the verdict of you all?\"    \"Of every one of us!\"    The judge leant back in his place, his eyes upon the desk before him,  without a movement or a gesture to strike the personal note which had  been suppressed with such admirable impartiality throughout the trial.  But it was several moments before his eyes were lifted with his voice.    \"Let her be discharged,\" was all he said even then; but he would seem to  have said it at once gruffly, angrily, thankfully, disgustedly, with  emotion, and without any emotion at all. You read the papers, and you  take your choice.    So Rachel Minchin was supported from the court before the round eyes of  a hundred or two of her fellow-creatures, in the pitiable state of one  who has been condemned to die, and not set free to live. It was as  though she still misunderstood a verdict which had filled most faces  with incredulity, but none with an astonishment to equal her own. Her  white face had leaped alight, but not with gladness. The pent-up emotion  of the week had broken forth in an agony of tears; and so they half led,  half carried her from the court. She had entered it for the last time  with courage enough; but it was the wrong kind of courage; and, for the  one supreme moment, sentence of life was harder to bear than sentence of  death.    In a few minutes the court was empty--a singular little theatre of pale  varnish and tawdry hangings, still rather snug and homely in the heat  and light of its obsolete gas, and with as little to remind one of the  play as any other theatre when the curtain is down and the house empty.  But there was clamor in the corridors, and hooting already in the  street. Nor was the house really empty after all. One white-haired  gentleman had not left his place when an attendant returned to put out  the lights. The attendant pointed him out to a constable at the door;  both watched him a few moments. Then the attendant stepped down and  touched him on the shoulder.    The gentleman turned slowly without a start. \"Ah, you're the man I want  to see,\" said he. \"Was that the Chief Warder in the dock?\"    \"Him with the beard,\" said the attendant, nodding.    \"Well, give him this, and give it him quick. I'll wait up there till he  can see me.\"    And he pressed his card into the attendant's palm, with a couple of  sovereigns underneath.    \"Wants to see the Chief Warder,\" explained the attendant to the  constable at the door.    \"He's been here all the week,\" mused the constable aloud. \"I wonder who  he is?\"    \"Name of Steel,\" whispered the other, consulting the card, as the  gentleman advanced up the steps toward them, the gaslight gleaming in  his silver hair, and throwing his firm features into strong relief.    \"And not a bad name for him,\" said the constable at the door.          CHAPTER IV    THE MAN IN THE TRAIN      Rachel fought her weakness with closed eyes, and was complete mistress  of herself when those about her thought that consciousness alone was  returning. She recognized the chamber at a glance; it was the one in  which generations of metropolitan malefactors, and a few innocent  persons like herself, had waited for the verdict of life or death. For  her it was life, life, life! And she wondered whether any other of the  few had ever come back to life with so little joy.    The female warders were supporting her in a chair; the prison doctor  stood over her with a medicine glass.    \"Drink this,\" said he, kindly.    \"But I have been conscious all the time.\"    \"Never mind. You need it.\"    And Rachel took the restorative without more words.    It did its work. The color came back to her face. The blood ran hot in  her veins. In a minute she was standing up without assistance.    \"And now,\" said Rachel, \"I shall not trespass further on your kindness,  and I am sure that you will not "]]]
