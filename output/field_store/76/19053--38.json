It was not lettered men who satisfied his  awakened curiosity; otherwise the quite confused ideas, especially in the  beginning of the revelation, concerning the mutual relations between Jews  and Christians could not be explained. Confusions between Miryam, the  sister of Moses, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, between Saul and Gideon,  mistakes about the relationship of Abraham to Isaac, Ishmael, and Jacob,  might be put down to misconceptions of Mohammed himself, who could not all  at once master the strange material. But his representation of Judaism and  Christianity and a number of other forms of revelation, as almost identical  in their contents, differing only in the place where, the time wherein, and  the messenger of God by whom they came to man; this idea, which runs like  a crimson thread through all the revelations of the first twelve years  of Mohammed's prophecy, could not have existed if he had had an intimate  acquaintance with Jewish or Christian men of letters. Moreover, the many  post-biblical features and stories which the Qoran contains concerning the  past of mankind, indicate a vulgar origin, and especially as regards  the Christian legends, communications from people who lived outside the  communion of the great Christian churches; this is sufficiently proved by  the docetical representation of the death of Jesus and the many stories  about his life, taken from apocryphal sources or from popular oral legends.    Mohammed's unlearned imagination worked all such material together into  a religious history of mankind, in which Adam's descendants had become  divided into innumerable groups of peoples differing in speech and place  of abode, whose aim in life at one period or another came to resemble  wonderfully that of the inhabitants of West- and Central-Arabia in the  seventh century A.D. Hereby they strayed from the true path, in strife with  the commands given by Allah. The whole of history, therefore, was for him  a long series of repetitions of the antithesis between the foolishness of  men, as this was now embodied in the social state of Mecca, and the wisdom  of God, as known to the \"People of the Scripture.\" To bring the erring ones  back to the true path, it was Allah's plan to send them messengers from out  of their midst, who delivered His ritual and His moral directions to them  in His own words, who demanded the acknowledgment of Allah's omnipotence,  and if they refused to follow the true guidance, threatened them with  Allah's temporary or, even more, with His eternal punishment.    The antithesis is always the same, from Adam to Jesus, and the enumeration  of the scenes is therefore rather monotonous; the only variety is in the  detail, borrowed from biblical and apocryphal legends. In all the thousands  of years the messengers of Allah play the same part as Mohammed finally saw  himself called upon to play towards his people.    Mohammed's account of the past contains more elements of Jewish than of  Christian origin, and he ignores the principal dogmas of the Christian  Church. In spite of his supernatural birth, Jesus is only a prophet  like Moses and others; and although his miracles surpass those of other  messengers, Mohammed at a later period of his life is inclined to place  Abraham above Jesus in certain respects. Yet the influence of Christianity  upon Mohammed's vocation was very great; without the Christian idea of the  final scene of human history, of the Resurrection of the dead and the Last  Judgment, Mohammed's mission would have no meaning. It is true, monotheism,  in the Jewish sense, and after the contrast had become clear to Mohammed,  accompanied by an express rejection of the Son of God and of the Trinity,  has become one of the principal dogmas of Islam. But in Mohammed's first  preaching, the announcement of the Day of judgment is much more prominent  than the Unity of God; and it was against his revelations concerning  Doomsday that his opponents directed their satire during the first twelve  years. It was not love of their half-dead gods but anger at the wretch who  was never tired of telling them, in the name of Allah, that all their  life was idle and despicable, that in the other world they would be the  outcasts, which opened the floodgates of irony and scorn against Mohammed.  And it was Mohammed's anxiety for his own lot and that of those who were  dear to him in that future life, that forced him to seek a solution of the  question: who shall bring my people out of the darkness of antithesis into  the light of obedience to Allah?    We should, _a posteriori_, be inclined to imagine a simpler answer to the  question than that which Mohammed found; he might have become a missionary  of Judaism or of Christianity to the Meccans. However natural such  a conclusion may appear to us, from the premises with which we are  acquainted, it did not occur to Mohammed. He began--the Qoran tells us  expressly--by regarding the Arabs, or at all events _his_ Arabs, as  heretofore destitute of divine message[1]: \"to whom We have sent no warner  before you.\" Moses and Jesus--not to mention any others--had not been sent  for the Arabs; and as Allah would not leave any section of mankind without  a revelation, their prophet must still be to come. Apparently Mohammed  regarded the Jewish and Christian tribes in Arabia as exceptions to the  rule that an ethnical group (_ummah_) was at the same time a religious  unity. He did not imagine that it could be in Allah's plan that the Arabs  were to conform to a revelation given in a foreign language. No; God must  speak to them in Arabic.[2] Through whose mouth?    [Footnote 1: _Qoran_, xxxii., 2; xxxiv., 43; xxxvi., 5, etc.]    [Footnote 2: _Ibid_., xii., 2; xiii., 37; XX., 112; XXVI., 195; xli., 44,  etc.]    A long and severe crisis preceded Mohammed's call. He was convinced that,  if he were the man, mighty signs from Heaven must be revealed to him, for  his conception of revelation was mechanical; Allah Himself, or at least  angels, must speak to him. The time of waiting, the process of objectifying  the subjective, lived through by the help of an overstrained imagination,  all this laid great demands upon the psychical and physical constitution of  Mohammed. At length he saw and heard that which he thought he ought to hear  and see. In feverish dreams he found the form for the revelation, and he  did not in the least realize that the contents of his inspiration from  Heaven were nothing but the result of what he had himself absorbed. He  realized it so little, that the identity of what was revealed to him with  what he held to be the contents of the Scriptures of Jews and Christians  was a miracle to him, the only miracle upon which he relied for the support  of his mission.    In the course of the twenty-three years of Mohammed's work as God's  messenger, the over-excited state, or inspiration, or whatever we may  call the peculiar spiritual condition in which his revelation was born,  gradually gave place to quiet reflection. Especially after the Hijrah, when  the prophet had to provide the state established by him at Medina with  inspired regulations, the words of God became in almost every respect  different from what they had been at first. Only the form was retained. In  connection with this evolution, some of our biographers of Mohammed, even  where they do not deny the obvious honesty of his first visions, represent  him in the second half of his work, as a sort of actor, who played with  that which had been most sacred to him. This accusation is, in my opinion,  unjust.    Mohammed, who twelve years long, in spite of derision and contempt,  continued to inveigh in the name of Allah against the frivolous  conservatism of the heathens in Mecca, to preach Allah's omnipotence to  them, to hold up to them Allah's commands and His promises and threats  regarding the future life, \"without asking any reward\" for such exhausting  work, is really not another man than the acknowledged \"Messenger of  Allah\" in Medina, who saw his power gradually increase, who was taught by  experience the value and the use of the material means of extending it,  and who finally, by the force of arms compelled all Arabs to \"obedience to  Allah and His messenger.\"    In our own society, real enthusiasm in the propagation of an idea generally  considered as absurd, if crowned by success may, in the course of time, end  in cold, prosaic calculation without a trace of hypocrisy. Nowhere in  the life of Mohammed can a point of turning be shown; there is a gradual  changing of aims and a readjustment of the means of attaining them. From  the first the outcast felt himself superior to the well-to-do people who  looked down upon him; and with all his power he sought for a position from  which he could force them to acknowledge his superiority. This he found in  the next and better world, of which the Jews and Christians knew. After a  crisis, which some consider as psychopathologic, he knew himself to be sent  by Allah to call the materialistic community, which he hated and despised,  to the alternative, either in following him to find eternal blessedness, or  in denying him to be doomed to eternal fire.    Powerless against the scepticism of his hearers, after twelve years of  preaching followed only by a few dozen, most of them outcasts like himself,  he hoped now and then that Allah would strike the recalcitrant multitude  with an earthly doom, as he knew from revelations had happened before. This  hope was also unfulfilled. As other messengers of God had done in similar  circumstances, he sought for a more fruitful field than that of his  birthplace; he set out on the Hijrah, _i.e._, emigration to Medina. Here  circumstances were more favourable to him: in a short time he became the  head of a considerable community.    Allah, who had given him power, soon "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#5)"],[1,"showed some inclination to permit mediation  on the points in her ultimatum to Serbia which were incompatible with  Serbia's sovereignty, has been categorically denied. The Vienna  _Fremdenblatt_ for September 24th, 1914, contains this official  announcement:    \"Vienna, September 24th. In a report of the late British Ambassador  published by the British Government, there is a passage which maintains  that Austria-Hungary's Ambassador, Count Szapary, in St. Petersburg had  informed Monsieur Sasonow, Russia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, that  Austria-Hungary 'was willing to submit the points in her Note to Serbia  which seemed incompatible with Serbian independence, to mediation.'    \"We have been informed officially that this statement is absolutely  untrue; according to the nature of the step taken by the monarchy in  Belgrade, it would have been absolutely unthinkable. The passage cited  from the British Ambassador's report, as well as some other phrases in  the same, are evidently inspired by a certain bias. They are intended to  prove, by asserting that Austria-Hungary was prepared to yield on some  points at issue, that German diplomacy was really responsible for the  outbreak of war.    \"Such attempts cannot obscure the truth, that Austria-Hungary and  Germany concurred in the wish to preserve European peace. If this wish  has not been fulfilled, and a European conflict has arisen out of a  local settlement, it can only be ascribed to the circumstance that  Russia first threatened Austria-Hungary and then Germany by an  unjustifiable mobilization. By this she forced war upon the Central  Powers and thus kindled a general conflagration.\"    In dealing with Germany's endeavours for peace Professor Oncken writes  on p. 546 of \"Deutschland und der Weltkrieg\" (\"Germany and the World  War\"): \"The work of German diplomacy took the form of giving warnings  and peaceful explanations.\" On July 26th she pointed out to the Russian  Government that \"preparatory military measures on Russia's part would  compel Germany to take corresponding steps, viz., the mobilization of  the army. Mobilization means war.\" Oncken does not quote any of the  \"peaceful explanations\" (_friedliche Erklaerungen_), and much as the  present writer would like to fill up this gap in his work, he must admit  his utter inability, because in the diplomatic correspondence he can  only find exasperating threats, thrown out to Russia by the two Germanic  Empires.    The whole problem allows of a very simple digest: On July 23rd,  Austria-Hungary handed her ultimatum to Serbia, therein stating her  demands, and on the following day informed all the European powers of  her attitude. The neutral Press of the world and an unusually large  section of the German Press, immediately pronounced Austria's position  to be indefensible and untenable. The German Government, in spite of  these facts, gave its official and unreserved support to Austria's  attitude on July 26th. After eight weeks of war (on September 25th),  Austria officially declared that she had never swerved from her original  claims, nor ever felt any inclination to do so.    It is true that the usages of everyday life do not always hold good in  diplomatic dealings, but it is instructive to state the case in the  terms of everyday affairs. Mr. A. (Austria) informs Mr. B. (Serbia) that  he has a quarrel to settle with him and states his demands. Mr. C.  (Russia) who is a relation, patron and friend of B.'s, interferes to see  fair play. Whereupon Mr. D. (Germany), a friend and relation of A.'s,  informs C. in unmistakable fashion that he must neither speak nor act in  the affair or he will be immediately thrashed. Messrs. A. and D. are  unanimous in this view and repeat the threat in mutual form. Meanwhile  A. attacks B. Mr. C, seeing that they will not accord him a hearing,  takes steps to compel them to hear him, at which point Mr. D. fulfils  his threat and falls upon C.    It is not yet clear whether Austria would have permitted Russia to take  over the role of adviser and second to Serbia in her unequal struggle  with Austria. But from the moment Germany appeared on the scene the  situation becomes perfectly simple: Russia has absolutely no right  either to speak or move in the matter. On this rock of immovable  Germanic obstinacy the Russian ship of State, was intended to meet with  diplomatic shipwreck. Should Russia attempt to avoid this fate, then the  German sword could be trusted to arrange matters in the way desired by  Germany.    The German language contains a very expressive phrase,  _Stimmungsmacherei_, which means creating or preparing a certain frame  of mind. How Germany's public opinion was tuned to the war melody is  seen by a study of the German newspapers published between July 25th and  August 1st. A great part of the German nation had welcomed Austria's  expressed determination to compel Serbia \"to lick her shoes,\" as a  London paper put it at the time. Only the Social Democratic Party  persisted in asserting that Austria was the provocative and guilty party  down to the evening of July 28th.    But three days earlier the process of educating public opinion against  Russia commenced. In fact, it required little tuning to arouse a  national chorus, which was swelled subsequently by the Social Democratic  voices, demanding that Russia too must bite the dust.    At the psychological moment the terms of the alliance between Germany  and Austria were launched in the Press. One paper[8] wrote: \"It is  interesting at the present moment to call to mind how the treaty  existing between Germany and Austria regulates the question of mutual  support.\" Then the various paragraphs are cited, and the article  concludes: \"That is to say: (1.) Assuming Austria attacks Serbia, and  Russia as a precautionary measure sends troops to the Austrian frontier  without commencing hostilities against the latter, then Germany is under  no obligation to intervene. (2.) Assuming that Serbia is the attacking  party, and Russia gives her support by military measures which threaten  Austria, then the German Empire must immediately assist the Hapsburg  monarchy with the whole of her military forces.    [Footnote 8: _Muenchen-Augsburger Abendzeitung_, July 27th.]    \"Hence it all depends upon who attacks; the interpretation of 'attack,'  however, is debatable both in politics and international law. Again and  again it has been asserted that that Power which declares war is not the  attacker, but the one which makes a continuance of peaceful relations  impossible.\"    Innumerable notices of Russia's alleged mobilization appeared and,  probably with a view to encouraging Germans to stand fast, ghastly  pictures of the weakness and unpreparedness of the Russian army, in a  word Russian rottenness and corruption. Persistent rumours of  revolutions in Russia were current.    A Vienna telegram published in Berlin[9] informed the German public  that: \"News received from Warsaw deny the rumours that a revolution has  broken out in Russian-Poland, but it is true that yesterday the entire  citadel in Warsaw was blown up. Official Russian reports endeavour to  prove that the explosion was caused by lightning. The extent of the  damage is not yet known, but in any case it amounts to hundreds of  thousands of roubles. It is also not certain whether any or how many  lives were lost.\"    [Footnote 9: _Vossische Zeitung_, July 29th.]    A few days later the German official organ _Norddeutsche Allgemeine  Zeitung_ and the semi-official _Koelnische Zeitung_ published the  following report of the explosion. \"According to the statement of the  Governor of Warsaw it was caused by revolutionaries. No proof of this  was forthcoming, therefore it was ascribed to lightning, and as nobody  believed this explanation--there was not a cloud on the sky at the  time--the guilt remained finally with the revolutionaries.    \"Now it has been proved, not to the satisfaction of the Russian  authorities of course, that Russian officers of high rank blew the  magazine up, because they would have to supply the troops with  ammunition after the mobilization--and the ammunition was not there. The  money for the same had found its way into the officers' pockets.\"    On July 30th the _Vossische Zeitung_ announced: \"To-day even more  alarming news has been in the air than in the last few days. The _Lokal  Anzeiger_ stated during the afternoon that an order for the mobilization  of the army and navy had been signed by the Kaiser. On making inquiries  in official quarters, we were informed that the 'news' is false. At  three o'clock Wolff's Bureau issued an official _dementi_: 'We have  received an official statement to the effect that the news published in  an extra edition of the _Berliner Lokal Anzeiger_ that the Kaiser had  ordered the general mobilization is untrue.' Great excitement was caused  by the _Lokal Anzeiger's_ announcement, and the public visibly  disquieted.\"    The above report refers, of course, to incidents which happened on the  preceding day. The 30th of July was marked by the suppression of three  Berlin papers, including the _Berliner Neuester Nachrichten_, for  divulging the fact that the 1st, 5th and 17th Army Corps had been  mobilized. An account of this _faux pas_ appeared on July 31st in the  _Kreuz Zeitung_ and concluded, after denying the truth of the  mobilization, with the following paragraph: \"If bodies of troops have  been moved to various points of our Eastern frontier, then it only means  the so-called frontier protection (_Grenzschutz_), which has been made  necessary by our Eastern neighbour strengthening his customary frontier  guards by troops of the line. Frontier protection is not generally  intended to prevent a serious attack, but means rather a kind of police  action.\"    Two other passages will suffice to illuminate the mobilization question.  \"Yesterday Russia gave official notification in "]]]
