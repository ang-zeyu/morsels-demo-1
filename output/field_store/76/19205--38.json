I have  not found any occupation so pleasant as talking to my friends, on paper,  upon such subjects as may admit of the transfer for their acceptance--and  may I not hope, for their gratification also?    The patriarchal manners are so often pictured to me, in many of the  every-day occurrences exhibited in the several families I have been most  acquainted with in India, that I seem to have gone back to that ancient  period with my new-sought home and new friends. Here I find the master and  mistress of a family receiving the utmost veneration from their slaves and  domestics, whilst the latter are permitted to converse and give their  opinions with a freedom (always respectful), that at the first view would  lead a stranger to imagine there could be no great inequality of station  between the persons conversing. The undeviating kindness to aged servants,  no longer capable of rendering their accustomed services; the remarkable  attention paid to the convenience and comfort of poor relatives, even to  the most remote in consanguinity; the beamings of universal charity; the  tenderness of parents; and the implicit obedience of children, are a few  of those amiable traits of character from whence my allusions are drawn,  and I will add, by which my respect has been commanded. In their  reverential homage towards parents, and in affectionate solicitude for the  happiness of those venerated authors of their existence, I consider them  the most praiseworthy people existing.    On the spirit of philanthropy exhibited in their general charity, I may  here remark, that they possess an injunction from their Lawgiver, 'to be  universally charitable'.[1] This command is reverenced and obeyed by all  who are his faithful followers. They are persuaded that almsgiving  propitiates the favour of Heaven, consequently this belief is the inducing  medium for clothing the naked, feeding the hungry, supporting the weak,  consoling the afflicted, protecting the fatherless, sheltering the  houseless traveller, and rendering the ear and the heart alive to the  distresses of the poor in all situations. A good Mussulmaun never allows  the voice to pass unheeded where the suppliant applies, 'In the name of  God', or 'For the love of God'.    I have often been obliged to hear the Mussulmauns accused of an  ostentatious display of their frequent acts of charity. It may be so in  some instances; human nature has failings common to all complexions. Pride  may sometimes open the purse of the affluent to the poor man's petition;  but when the needy benefit by the rich, it is unjust to scrutinize the  heart's motive, where the act itself alleviates the present sufferings of  a fellow-creature.    Imposition is doubtless often practised with success by the indolent, who  excite the good feelings of the wealthy by a tale of woe; the sin rests  with him who begs unworthily, not with him who relieves the supposed  distresses of his poorer neighbour. The very best of human beings will  acknowledge they derive benefits from the bounty of their Maker, not  because they are deserving, but that 'He is merciful'.    I shall have occasion to detail in my Letters some of the Mussulmaun  observances, festivals, &c., which cannot be accomplished without feeding  the poor; and, in justice to their general character, be it acknowledged,  their liberality is not confined to those stated periods.    The Syaads[2] (Meers[3]) are descendants from Mahumud, the acknowledged  Prophet and Lawgiver of the Mussulmauns; and, as might be expected, are  peculiar objects of respect and favour amongst the true believers (as  those who hold their faith are designated). 'The poor Syaad's family' are  the first to be considered when the rich have determined on dispensing  gifts in charity. The Syaads, however, are under peculiar restrictions as  regards the nature of those gifts which they are permitted to accept.  Money obtained by unlawful means, as forbidden in the Khoraun[4] (usury  for instance[5]), is deemed polluted, and must neither be offered to, nor  accepted by, these 'children of the Prophet'.    The Syaads are the Lords of Mussulmaun society, and every female born to  them is a Lady (Begum[6]). Heralds' offices they have none, but genealogy  is strictly kept in each Mussulmaun family, who can boast the high  privilege of bearing the Prophet's blood in their veins. The children of  both sexes are taught, from the time of their first speaking intelligibly,  to recount their pedigree, up to Hasan, or Hosein, the two sons of Ali, by  his cousin Fatima, the daughter of their Prophet: this forms a striking  part of their daily education, whilst they continue in their mother's  zeenahnah[7] (lady's apartment); and, from the frequent repetition, is so  firmly fixed in the memory, that they have no difficulty in tracing their  pedigree whenever called upon to do so, unaided by the manuscript  genealogy kept with care in the parental treasury.    This method of retaining lineage is not always a check against impostors;  many have taken upon themselves the honourable distinction of the Syaad,  without having the slightest claim to the title; but when the cheat is  discovered such persons are disgraced, and become aliens to the  respectable. So many advantages are enjoyed by Syaads, that it is not  surprising there should be some, which have no right, anxious to be  numbered with those who are truly the Mussulmaun lords; though such men  are taught to believe that, by the usurpation, they shut themselves out  from the advantages of their Prophet's intercession at the great day of  judgment.    The Syaads are very tenacious in retaining the purity of their race  unsullied, particularly with respect to their daughters; a conscientious  Syaad regards birth before wealth in negotiations for marriage: many a  poor lady, in consequence of this prejudice, lives out her numbered days  in single blessedness, although--to their honour be it told--many  charitably disposed amongst the rich men of the country have, within my  recollection of Indian society, granted from their abundance sufficient  sums to defray the expenses of a union, and given the marriage portion,  unsolicited, to the daughters of the poorer members of this venerated race.  A Syaad rarely speaks of his pecuniary distresses, but is most grateful  when relieved.    I am intimately acquainted with a family in which this pride of birth  predominates over every advantage of interest. There are three unmarried  daughters, remarkable for their industrious habits, morality, and strict  observance of their religious duties; they are handsome, well-formed women,  polite and sensible, and to all this they add an accomplishment which is  not by any means general amongst the females of Hindoostaun, they have  been taught by their excellent father to read the Khoraun in Arabic--it is  not allowed to be translated,[8]--and the Commentary in Persian. The fame  of their superiority has brought many applications from the heads of  families possessing wealth, and desirous to secure for their sons wives so  eminently endowed, who would waive all considerations of the marriage  dowry, for the sake of the Begum who might thus adorn their untitled house.  All these offers, however, have been promptly rejected, and the young  ladies themselves are satisfied in procuring a scanty subsistence by the  labour of their hands. I have known them to be employed in working the  jaullie[9] (netting) for courties[10] (a part of the female dress), which,  after six days' close application, at the utmost could not realize three  shillings each; yet I never saw them other than contented, happy, and  cheerful,--a family of love, and patterns of sincere piety.    The titles and distinctions conferred by sovereigns, or the Hon. East  India Company in India, as Khaun,[11] Bahadhoor,[12] Nuwaub,[13] &c., are  not actually hereditary honours, though often presumed on, and indulged in,  by successors. The Syaads, on the contrary, are the Meers and Begums  (nobility) throughout their generations to the end of time, or at any rate,  with the continuance of the Mussulmaun religion.    Having thus far explained the honourable distinction of the Syaads, I  propose giving you some account of the Mahurrum,[14] a celebrated mourning  festival in remembrance of their first martyrs, and which occupies the  attention of the Mussulmauns annually to a degree of zeal that has always  attracted the surprise of our countrymen in India; some of whom, I trust,  will not be dissatisfied with the observations of an individual, who  having spent many years of her life with those who are chief actors in  these scenes, it may be expected, is the better able to explain the nature  of that Mahurrum which they see commemorated every year, yet many, perhaps,  without comprehending exactly why. Those strong expressions of grief--the  sombre cast of countenance,--the mourning garb,--the self-inflicted  abstinence, submitted to by the Mussulmaun population, during the ten days  set apart for the fulfilment of the mourning festival, all must have  witnessed who have been in Hindoostaun for any period.    I must first endeavour to represent the principal causes for the observance  of Mahurrum; and for the information of those who have witnessed its  celebration, as well as for the benefit of others who have not had the same  opportunity, describe the manner of celebrating the event, which occurred  more than twelve hundred years ago.    Hasan and Hosein were the two sons of Fatima and Ali, from whom the whole  Syaad race have generated; Hasan was poisoned by an emissary of the  usurping Calipha's;[15] and Hosein, the last sad victim of the family to  the King Yuzeed's[16] fury, suffered a cruel death, after the most severe  trials, on the plains of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13166"],[0,"The Psalms of David (#5)"],[1,"children raise:  In Zion's gates, with cheerful breath,  They sing their Father's praise.    3 His foes shall fail with heedless feet  Into the pit they made;  And sinners perish in the net  That their own hands had spread.    4 Thus by thy judgments, mighty God!  Are thy deep counsels known;  When men of mischief are destroy'd,  The snare must be their own.    PAUSE.    5 The wicked shall sink down to hell;  Thy wrath devour the lands  That dare forget thee, or rebel  Against thy known commands.    6 Tho' saints to sore distress are brought,  And wait and long complain,  Their cries shall not be still forgot,  Nor shall their hopes be vain.    7 [Rise, great Redeemer, from thy seat,  To judge and save the poor;  Let nations tremble at thy feet,  And man prevail no more.    8 Thy thunder shall affright the proud,  And put their hearts to pain,  Make them confess that thou art God,  And they but feeble men.]      Psalm 10.  Prayer heard, and saints saved; or, Pride,  atheism, and oppression punished.    For a humiliation day.    1 Why doth the Lord stand off so far,  And why conceal his face,  When great calamities appear,  And times of deep distress?    2 Lord, shall the wicked still deride  Thy justice and thy pow'r?  Shall they advance their heads in pride,  And still thy saints devour?    3 They put thy judgments from their sight,  And then insult the poor;  They boast in their exalted height  That they shall fall no more.    4 Arise, O God, lift up thine hand,  Attend our humble cry;  No enemy shall dare to stand  When God ascends on high.    PAUSE.    5 Why do the men of malice rage,  And say with foolish pride,  \"The God of heaven will ne'er engage  To fight on Zion's side?\"    6 But thou for ever art our Lord;  And pow'rful is thine hand,  As when the heathens felt thy sword,  And perish'd from thy land.    7 Thou wilt prepare our hearts to pray,  And cause thine ear to hear;  He hearkens what his children say,  And puts the world in fear.    8 Proud tyrants shall no more oppress,  No more despise the just;  And mighty sinners shall confess  They are but earth and dust.      Psalm 11.  God loves the righteous and hates the wicked.    1 My refuge is the God of love;  Why do my foes insult and cry,  \"Fly like a timorous trembling dove,  \"To distant woods or mountains fly\"?    2 If government be all destroy'd  (That firm foundation of our peace)  And violence make justice void,  Where shall the righteous seek redress?    3 The Lord in heaven has fix'd his throne,  His eye surveys the world below;  To him all mortal things are known,  His eyelids search our spirits thro'.    4 If he afflicts his saints so far  To prove their love, and try their grace,  What may the bold transgressors fear?  His very soul abhors their ways.    5 On impious wretches he shall rain  Tempests of brimstone, fire, and death,  Such as he kindled on the plain  Of Sodom with his angry breath.    6 The righteous Lord loves righteous souls,  Whose thoughts and actions are sincere;  And with a gracious eye beholds  The men that his own image bear.      Psalm 12:1. L. M.  The saint's safety and hope in evil times;  or, Sins of the tongue complained of,  viz, blasphemy, falsehood, &c.    1 Lord, if thou dost not soon appear,  Virtue and truth will fly away;  A faithful man, amongst us here,  Will scarce be found if thou delay.    2 The whole discourse, when neighbours meet,  Is fill'd with trifles loose and vain;  Their lips are flattery and deceit,  And their proud language is profane.    3 But lips, that with deceit abound,  Shall not maintain their triumph long;  The God of vengeance will confound  The flattering and blaspheming tongue.    4 \"Yet shall our words be free,\" they cry,  \"Our tongue shall be controll'd by none:  \"Where is the Lord will ask us why?  \"Or say, our lips are not our own?\"    5 The Lord who sees the poor opprest,  And hears th' oppressor's haughty strain,  Will rise to give his children rest,  Nor shall they trust his word in vain.    6 Thy word, O Lord, tho' often try'd,  Void of deceit shall still appear  Not silver, seven times purify'd  From dross and mixture, shines so clear.    7 Thy grace shall in the darkest hour  Defend the holy soul from harm;  Tho' when the vilest men have power  On every side will sinners swarm.      Psalm 12:2. C. M.  Complaint of a general corruption of manners; or,  The promise and signs of Christ's coming to judgment.    1 Help, Lord, for men of virtue fail,  Religion loses ground,  The sons of violence prevail,  And treacheries abound.    2 Their oaths and promises they break,  Yet act the flatterer's part;  With fair deceitful lips they speak,  And with a double heart.    3 If we reprove some hateful lie,  How is their fury stirr'd!  \"Are not our lips our own\" they cry,  \"And who shall be our lord?\"    4 Scoffers appear on every side,  Where a vile race of men  Is rais'd to seats of power and pride,  And bears the sword in vain.    PAUSE.    5 Lord, when iniquities abound,  And blasphemy grows bold,  When faith is hardly to be found,  And love is waxing cold,    6 Is not thy chariot hastening on?  Hast thou not given this sign?  May we not trust and live upon  A promise so divine?    7 \"Yes,\" saith the Lord, \"now will I rise,  \"And make oppressors flee;  \"I shall appear to their surprise,  \"And set my servants free.\"    8 Thy word, like silver seven times try'd,  Thro' ages shall endure;  The men that in thy truth confide,  Shall find thy promise sure.      Psalm 13:1. L. M.  Pleading with God under desertion;  or, Hope, in darkness.    1 How long, 0 Lord, shall I complain  Like one that seeks his God in vain?  Canst thou thy face for ever hide?  And I still pray and be deny'd?    2 Shall I for ever be forgot  As one whom thou regardest not?  Still shall my soul thine absence mourn?  And still despair of thy return?    3 How long shall my poor troubled breast  Be with these anxious thoughts opprest?  And Satan, my malicious foe,  Rejoice to see me sunk so low.    4 Hear, Lord, and grant me quick relief,  Before my death conclude my grief;  If thou withhold thy heavenly light,  I sleep in everlasting night.    5 How will the powers of darkness boast,  If but one praying soul be lost!  But I have trusted in thy grace,  And shall again behold thy face.    6 Whate'er my fears or foes suggest,  Thou art my hope, my joy, my rest;  My heart shall feel thy love, and raise  My cheerful voice to songs of praise.      Psalm 13:2. C. M.  Complaint under temptations of the devil.    1 How long wilt thou conceal thy face?  My God, how long delay?  When shall I feel those heavenly rays  That chase my fears away?    2 How long shall my poor labouring soul  Wrestle and toil in vain?  Thy word can all my foes control,  And ease my raging pain.    3 See how the prince of darkness tries  All his malicious arts,  He spreads a mist around my eyes,  And throws his fiery darts.    4 Be thou my sun and thou my shield,  My soul in safety keep;  Make haste before mine eyes are seal'd  In death's eternal sleep.    5 How would the tempter boast aloud  If I become his prey!  Behold the sons of hell grow proud  At thy so long delay.    6 But they shall fly at thy rebuke,  And Satan hide his head;  He knows the terrors of thy look  And hears thy voice with dread.    7 Thou wilt display that sovereign grace,  Where all my hopes have hung;  I shall employ my lips in praise,  And victory shall be sung.      Psalm 14:1. First Part.  By nature all men are sinners.    1 Fools in their hearts believe and say,  \"That all religion's vain,  \"There is no God that reigns on high,  \"Or minds th' affairs of men.\"    2 From thoughts so dreadful and profane  Corrupt discourse proceeds;  And in their impious hands are found  Abominable deeds.    3 The Lord, from his celestial throne  Look'd down on things below,  To find the man that sought his grace,  Or did his justice know.    4 By nature all are gone astray,  Their practice all the same;  There's none that fears his Maker's hand,  There's none that loves his name.    5 Their tongues are us'd to speak deceit,  Their slanders never cease;  How swift to mischief are their feet,  Nor knew the paths of peace.    6 Such seeds of sin (that bitter root)  In every heart are found;  Nor can they bear diviner fruit,  Till grace refine the ground.      Psalm 14:2. Second Part.  The folly of persecutors.    1 Are sinners now so senseless grown  That they thy saints devour?  And never worship at thy throne,  Nor fear thine awful power?    2 Great God appear to their surprise,  Reveal thy dreadful name;  Let them no more thy wrath despise,  Nor turn our hope to shame.    3 Dost thou not dwell among the just?  And yet our foes deride,  That we should make thy name our trust;  Great God, confound their pride.    4 O that the joyful day were come  To finish our distress!  When God shall bring his children home,  Our songs shall never cease.      Psalm 15:1. C. M.  Characters of a saint; or, a citizen of Zion;  or, The qualifications of a Christian.    1 Who shall inhabit in thy hill,  O God of holiness?  Whom will the Lord admit to dwell  So near his throne of grace?    2 The man that walks in pious ways,  And works with righteous hands;  That trusts his Maker's promises,  And follows his commands.    3 He speaks the meaning of his heart,  Nor slanders with his tongue;  Will scarce believe an ill report,  Nor do his neighbour wrong.    4 The wealthy sinner he contemns,  Loves all that fear the Lord:  And tho' to his own hurt he swears,  Still he performs his word.    5 His hands disdain a golden bribe,  And never gripe the poor;  This man shall dwell with God on earth,  And find his heaven secure.      Psalm 15:2. L. M.  Religion and justice, goodness and truth;  or, Duties to God and man;  or, The qualifications of a Christian.    1 Who shall ascend thy heavenly place,  Great God, and dwell before thy face?  The man that minds religion now,  And humbly walks with God below:    2"]]]
