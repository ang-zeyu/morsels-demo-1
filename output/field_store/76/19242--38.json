And yet it is perhaps not  going too far to say that for one young girl who is killed or  invalided rapidly by diphtheria there are hundreds who are condemned  to a quasi-invalid life owing to this persistent supply of poison to  the system.    Another condition of the throat which causes much ill-health is well  known to the public under the name of adenoids. Unfortunately,  however, many people have an erroneous idea that children will \"grow  out of adenoids.\" Even if this were true it is extremely unwise to  wait for so desirable an event. Adenoids may continue to grow, and  during the years that they are present they work great mischief. Owing  to the blocking of the air-passages the mouth is kept constantly open,  greatly to the detriment of the throat and lungs. Owing to the  interference with the circulation at the back of the nose and throat,  a considerable amount both of apparent and real stupidity is produced,  the brain works less well than it ought, and the child's appearance is  ruined by the flat, broad bridge of the nose and the gaping mouth. The  tale of troubles due to adenoids is not even yet exhausted; a  considerable amount of discharge collects about them which it is not  easy to clear away, it undergoes very undesirable changes, and is then  swallowed to the great detriment of the stomach and the digestion. The  removal of septic tonsils and of adenoids is most urgently necessary,  and usually involves little distress or danger. The change in the  child's health and appearance that can thus be secured is truly  wonderful, especially if it be taught, as it should be, to keep its  mouth shut and to breathe through the nose. In the course of a few  months the complexion will have cleared, the expression will have  regained its natural intelligence, digestion will be well performed,  and the child's whole condition will be that of alert vigour instead  of one of listless and sullen indifference.    Errors of Digestion.--From the consideration of certain states of  the nose, mouth, and throat, it is easy to turn to what is so often  their consequence. Many forms of indigestion are due to the septic  materials swallowed. It would not, however, be fair to say that all  indigestion is thus caused; not infrequently indigestion is due to  errors of diet, and here the blame must be divided between the poverty  and ignorance of many parents and the self-will of adolescents. The  foods that are best for young people--such as bread, milk, butter,  sugar, and eggs--are too frequently scarce in their dietaries owing to  their cost; and again, in the case of many girls whose parents are  able and willing to provide them with a thoroughly satisfactory  diet-sheet, dyspepsia is caused by their refusal to take what is good  for them, and by their preference for unsuitable and indigestible  viands.    A further cause of indigestion must be sought in the haste with which  food is too often eaten. The failure to rise at the appointed time  leads to a hasty breakfast, and this must eventually cause  indigestion. The food imperfectly masticated and not sufficiently  mixed with saliva enters the stomach ill-prepared, and the hasty rush  to morning school or morning work effectually prevents the stomach  from dealing satisfactorily with the mass so hastily thrust into it.    There is an old saying that \"Those whom the gods will destroy they  first make mad,\" and in many instances young people who fall victims  to the demon of dyspepsia owe their sorrows, if not to madness, at any  rate to ignorance and want of consideration. The defective teeth,  septic tonsils, discharging adenoids, poverty of their parents and  their own laziness, all conspire to cause digestive troubles which  bear a fruitful crop of further evils, for thus are caused such  illnesses as anaemia and gastric ulcer.    Constipation claims a few words to itself. And here again we ought  to consider certain septic processes. The refuse of the food should  travel along the bowels at a certain rate, but if owing to  sluggishness of their movements or to defects in the quality and  amount of their secretion, the refuse is too long retained the masses  become unduly dry, and, constantly shrinking in volume, are no longer  capable of being urged along the tube at the proper rate. In  consequence of this the natural micro-organisms of the intestine cease  to be innocent and become troublesome; they lead in the long run to a  peculiar form of blood-poisoning, and to so many diseased conditions  that it is impossible to deal with them at the present moment. The  existence of constipation is too often a signal for the administration  of many doses of medicine. The wiser, the less harmful, and the more  effectual method of dealing with it would be to endeavour to secure  the natural action of the bowels by a change in the diet, which should  contain more vegetable and less animal constituents. The patient  should also be instructed to drink plenty of water, either hot or  cold, a large glassful on going to bed and one on first awaking, and  also if necessary an hour before each meal. Steady exercise is also of  very great service, and instead of starting so late as to have no time  for walking to school or work, a certain portion of the daily journey  should be done on foot. Further, in all cases where it is possible,  team games, gymnastics, and dancing should be called in to supplement  the walk.    Headache.--Headache may be due to so many different causes that it  would be impossible in this little book to adequately consider them,  but it would not be fair to omit to mention that in many cases the  headache of young people is due to their want of spectacles. The idea  that spectacles are only required by people advanced in life is by  this time much shaken, but even now not only many parents object to  their children enjoying this most necessary assistance to imperfect  vision, but also employers may be found so foolish and selfish as to  refuse to employ those persons who need to wear glasses. The folly as  well as selfishness of this objection is demonstrated by the far  better work done by a person whose vision has been corrected, and the  absolute danger incurred by all who have to deal with machinery if  vision is imperfect. Among other causes for headache are the defects  of mouth, throat, stomach, and bowels already described, because in  all of them there is a supply of septic material to the blood which  naturally causes headache and other serious symptoms.    Abnormalities of Menstruation.--The normal period should occur at  regular intervals about once a month. Its duration and amount vary  within wide limits, but in each girl it should remain true to her  individual type, and it ought not to be accompanied by pain or  distress. As a rule the period starts quite normally, and it is not  until the girl's health has been spoiled by over-exertion of body or  mind, by unwise exertion during the period, or by continued exposure  to damp or cold, that it becomes painful and abnormal in time or in  amount.    One of the earliest signs of approaching illness--such as consumption,  anaemia, and mental disorder--is to be found in the more or less sudden  cessation of the period. This should always be taken as a  danger-signal, and as indicating the need of special medical advice.    Another point that should enter into intimate talk with girls is to  make them understand the co-relation of their own functions to the  great destiny that is in store. A girl is apt to be both shocked and  humiliated when she first hears of menstruation and its phenomena.  Should this function commence before she is told about it, she will  necessarily look upon it with disgust and perhaps with fear. It is  indeed a most alarming incident in the case of a girl who knows  nothing about it, but if, before the advent of menstruation, it be  explained to her that it is a sign of changes within her body that  will gradually, after the lapse of some years, fit her also to take  her place amongst the mothers of the land, her shame and fear will be  converted into modest gladness, and she will readily understand why  she is under certain restrictions, and has at times to give up work or  pleasure in order that her development may be without pain, healthy,  and complete.          CHAPTER IV.    MENTAL AND MORAL TRAINING.      The years of adolescence, during which rapid growth and development  inevitably cause so much stress and frequently give rise to danger,  are the very years in which the weight of school education necessarily  falls most heavily. The children of the poor leave school at fourteen  years of age, just the time when the children of the wealthier classes  are beginning to understand the necessity of education and to work  with a clearer realisation of the value and aim of lessons. The whole  system of education has altered of late years, and school work is now  conducted far more intelligently and with a greater appreciation of  the needs and capacities of the pupils than it was some fifty years  ago. Work is made more interesting, the relation of different studies  to each other is more adequately put in evidence, and the influence  that school studies have on success in after life is more fully  realised by all concerned. The system of training is, however, far  from perfect. In the case of girls, more particularly, great care has  to be exercised not to attempt to teach too much, and to give careful  consideration to the physiological peculiarities of the pupils. It is  impossible for girls who are undergoing such rapid physiological and  psychical changes to be always equally able and fit for strenuous  work. There are days in every girl's life when she is not capable of  her best work, and when a wise and sympathetic teacher will see that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1377"],[0,"The Talisman (#5)"],[1," whom they were seldom granted, and endeared by the very circumstances  which rendered them transitory. It is not worth while preserving any  permanent enmity against a foe whom a champion has fought with to-day,  and may again stand in bloody opposition to on the next morning. The  time and situation afforded so much room for the ebullition of violent  passions, that men, unless when peculiarly opposed to each other,  or provoked by the recollection of private and individual wrongs,  cheerfully enjoyed in each other's society the brief intervals of  pacific intercourse which a warlike life admitted.    The distinction of religions, nay, the fanatical zeal which animated the  followers of the Cross and of the Crescent against each other, was much  softened by a feeling so natural to generous combatants, and especially  cherished by the spirit of chivalry. This last strong impulse had  extended itself gradually from the Christians to their mortal enemies  the Saracens, both of Spain and of Palestine. The latter were, indeed,  no longer the fanatical savages who had burst from the centre of Arabian  deserts, with the sabre in one hand and the Koran in the other, to  inflict death or the faith of Mohammed, or, at the best, slavery and  tribute, upon all who dared to oppose the belief of the prophet of  Mecca. These alternatives indeed had been offered to the unwarlike  Greeks and Syrians; but in contending with the Western Christians,  animated by a zeal as fiery as their own, and possessed of as  unconquerable courage, address, and success in arms, the Saracens  gradually caught a part of their manners, and especially of those  chivalrous observances which were so well calculated to charm the minds  of a proud and conquering people. They had their tournaments and games  of chivalry; they had even their knights, or some rank analogous; and  above all, the Saracens observed their plighted faith with an accuracy  which might sometimes put to shame those who owned a better religion.  Their truces, whether national or betwixt individuals, were faithfully  observed; and thus it was that war, in itself perhaps the greatest  of evils, yet gave occasion for display of good faith, generosity,  clemency, and even kindly affections, which less frequently occur in  more tranquil periods, where the passions of men, experiencing wrongs or  entertaining quarrels which cannot be brought to instant decision, are  apt to smoulder for a length of time in the bosoms of those who are so  unhappy as to be their prey.    It was under the influence of these milder feelings which soften the  horrors of warfare that the Christian and Saracen, who had so lately  done their best for each other's mutual destruction, rode at a slow pace  towards the fountain of palm-trees to which the Knight of the Couchant  Leopard had been tending, when interrupted in mid-passage by his  fleet and dangerous adversary. Each was wrapt for some time in his own  reflections, and took breath after an encounter which had threatened to  be fatal to one or both; and their good horses seemed no less to enjoy  the interval of repose.    That of the Saracen, however, though he had been forced into much the  more violent and extended sphere of motion, appeared to have suffered  less from fatigue than the charger of the European knight. The sweat  hung still clammy on the limbs of the latter, when those of the noble  Arab were completely dried by the interval of tranquil exercise, all  saving the foam-flakes which were still visible on his bridle and  housings. The loose soil on which he trod so much augmented the distress  of the Christian's horse, heavily loaded by his own armour and the  weight of his rider, that the latter jumped from his saddle, and led his  charger along the deep dust of the loamy soil, which was burnt in the  sun into a substance more impalpable than the finest sand, and thus  gave the faithful horse refreshment at the expense of his own additional  toil; for, iron-sheathed as he was, he sunk over the mailed shoes at  every step which he placed on a surface so light and unresisting.    \"You are right,\" said the Saracen--and it was the first word that either  had spoken since their truce was concluded; \"your strong horse deserves  your care. But what do you in the desert with an animal which sinks over  the fetlock at every step as if he would plant each foot deep as the  root of a date-tree?\"    \"Thou speakest rightly, Saracen,\" said the Christian knight, not  delighted at the tone with which the infidel criticized his favourite  steed--\"rightly, according to thy knowledge and observation. But my good  horse hath ere now borne me, in mine own land, over as wide a lake as  thou seest yonder spread out behind us, yet not wet one hair above his  hoof.\"    The Saracen looked at him with as much surprise as his manners permitted  him to testify, which was only expressed by a slight approach to a  disdainful smile, that hardly curled perceptibly the broad, thick  moustache which enveloped his upper lip.    \"It is justly spoken,\" he said, instantly composing himself to his usual  serene gravity; \"List to a Frank, and hear a fable.\"    \"Thou art not courteous, misbeliever,\" replied the Crusader, \"to doubt  the word of a dubbed knight; and were it not that thou speakest in  ignorance, and not in malice, our truce had its ending ere it is well  begun. Thinkest thou I tell thee an untruth when I say that I, one of  five hundred horsemen, armed in complete mail, have ridden--ay, and  ridden for miles, upon water as solid as the crystal, and ten times less  brittle?\"    \"What wouldst thou tell me?\" answered the Moslem. \"Yonder inland sea  thou dost point at is peculiar in this, that, by the especial curse of  God, it suffereth nothing to sink in its waves, but wafts them away, and  casts them on its margin; but neither the Dead Sea, nor any of the  seven oceans which environ the earth, will endure on their surface the  pressure of a horse's foot, more than the Red Sea endured to sustain the  advance of Pharaoh and his host.\"    \"You speak truth after your knowledge, Saracen,\" said the Christian  knight; \"and yet, trust me, I fable not, according to mine. Heat, in  this climate, converts the soil into something almost as unstable  as water; and in my land cold often converts the water itself into  a substance as hard as rock. Let us speak of this no longer, for  the thoughts of the calm, clear, blue refulgence of a winter's lake,  glimmering to stars and moonbeam, aggravate the horrors of this fiery  desert, where, methinks, the very air which we breathe is like the  vapour of a fiery furnace seven times heated.\"    The Saracen looked on him with some attention, as if to discover in  what sense he was to understand words which, to him, must have appeared  either to contain something of mystery or of imposition. At length he  seemed determined in what manner to receive the language of his new  companion.    \"You are,\" he said, \"of a nation that loves to laugh, and you make sport  with yourselves, and with others, by telling what is impossible, and  reporting what never chanced. Thou art one of the knights of France, who  hold it for glee and pastime to GAB, as they term it, of exploits that  are beyond human power. [Gaber. This French word signified a sort of  sport much used among the French chivalry, which consisted in vying  with each other in making the most romantic gasconades. The verb and the  meaning are retained in Scottish.] I were wrong to challenge, for the  time, the privilege of thy speech, since boasting is more natural to  thee than truth.\"    \"I am not of their land, neither of their fashion,\" said the Knight,  \"which is, as thou well sayest, to GAB of that which they dare not  undertake--or, undertaking, cannot perfect. But in this I have imitated  their folly, brave Saracen, that in talking to thee of what thou canst  not comprehend, I have, even in speaking most simple truth, fully  incurred the character of a braggart in thy eyes; so, I pray you, let my  words pass.\"    They had now arrived at the knot of palm-trees and the fountain which  welled out from beneath their shade in sparkling profusion.    We have spoken of a moment of truce in the midst of war; and this, a  spot of beauty in the midst of a sterile desert, was scarce less dear  to the imagination. It was a scene which, perhaps, would elsewhere have  deserved little notice; but as the single speck, in a boundless  horizon, which promised the refreshment of shade and living water, these  blessings, held cheap where they are common, rendered the fountain and  its neighbourhood a little paradise. Some generous or charitable hand,  ere yet the evil days of Palestine began, had walled in and arched over  the fountain, to preserve it from being absorbed in the earth, or choked  by the flitting clouds of dust with which the least breath of wind  covered the desert. The arch was now broken, and partly ruinous; but it  still so far projected over and covered in the fountain that it excluded  the sun in a great measure from its waters, which, hardly touched by a  straggling beam, while all around was blazing, lay in a steady repose,  alike delightful to the eye and the imagination. Stealing from under the  arch, they were first received in a marble basin, much defaced indeed,  but still cheering the eye, by showing that the place was anciently  considered as a station, that the hand of man had been there and that  man's accommodation had been in some measure attended to. The thirsty  and weary traveller was reminded by these signs that others had suffered  similar difficulties, reposed in the same spot, and, doubtless, found  their way in safety to a more fertile country. Again, the scarce visible  current which escaped from the basin served to nourish the few trees  which surrounded the fountain, and where it sunk into the ground and  disappeared, its refreshing presence was"]]]
