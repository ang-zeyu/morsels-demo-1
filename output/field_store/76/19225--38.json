The watchfulness of this party machinery, plus an increasingly  vigilant public opinion, has corrected many of the election frauds  which were once common and most elections are now probably free from  all the baser forms of corruption. When a question on referendum is  sincerely espoused by both the dominant parties it has the advantage  of the watchfulness of both party machines and is doubly safeguarded  from fraud. But when such a question has been espoused by no dominant  party it is utterly at the mercy of the worst forms of corruption.  The election officers have even been known to wink at irregularities  plainly committed since it was no affair of theirs. Or, they may even  go further and join in the entertaining game of running in as many  votes against such an amendment as possible. This has not infrequently  been the unhappy experience of suffrage amendments in corrupt  quarters.    Honest election officers, respecting \"the will of the majority\" as  the sovereign of our nation, would protect honesty in elections,  regardless of their own or their party's views, but unhappily that  high standard is not universal.    Surely, the method of taking the vote and of safeguarding the honesty  of elections should be the most important and fundamental of all  questions in a republic. Such laws ought to be preliminary to all  other laws. Yet as a matter of fact the laxity and ambiguity of  many state election laws and the utter inadequacy of provisions for  enforcement are almost unbelievable. The contemplation of the actual  facts seriously reflects upon the intelligence and good faith of the  successive lawmakers of our land.    With no one on the election board whose special business it is to see  that honesty is upheld, a suffrage amendment must face further hazards  through the fact that most states do not permit women, or even special  men watchers, to stand guard over the vote and the count upon such  questions.    When it is remembered that immigrants may be naturalized after a  residence of five years; that when naturalized they automatically  become voters by all our state constitutions; that in eight states[A]  immigrant voters are not even required to be citizens; that the right  to vote is limited by an educational qualification in only seventeen  states, and that nine of these are Southern, with special intent to  disfranchise the Negro while allowing the illiterate White to vote;  that evidence exists to prove that there is an unscrupulous body  ready to engage the lowest elements of our population by fraudulent  processes to oppose a suffrage amendment; that there is no authority  on the election board whose business it is to see that an amendment  gets a \"square deal\"; that the method of preparing the ballot is often  a distinct advantage to a corrupt opposition; and that when fraud is  committed there is practically no redress provided by election laws,  it ought to be clear to all that state constitutional amendments  when unsponsored by the dominant political parties which control the  election machinery, must run the gauntlet of intolerably unjust and  unfair conditions. When suffragists have been fortunate enough to  overcome the obstacles imposed by the constitution of their states  and a referendum to the male voters has been secured, they must  immediately enter upon the task of surmounting the infinitely greater  obstructions of the election law. They make their appeal to the public  upon the supposition that a majority of independent voters is  to decide their question. Instead, they may discover that in a  determining number of precincts the taking of the actual vote is a  game in which the cards are stacked against them. One woman, who had  watched at a precinct all day in a suffrage amendment election, said  \"Something went out of me that day which never came back--and that was  pride in my country. At first I thought it was disappointment  produced by the defeat of the woman suffrage amendment, but when I had  recovered and could think calmly, I knew it was not that. I was still  patient and still willing to go on working, struggling, sacrificing,  for my right to vote; but I could not forget that I lived in a land  which tolerated the things I saw that day.\" The women who know cannot  rise to \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" without a \"lump in their throats,\"  for they recognize the terrible fact that hidden under the beautiful  pretense of democracy is a hideous menace to our national liberties,  which no political party, no legislature, no congress, has dared to  drag out into the daylight of public knowledge.    [Footnote A: The number of states which permitted men to vote on  \"first papers\" was formerly fifteen. The following eight states  still perpetuate this provision: Arkansas, Delaware, Indiana, Kansas,  Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, Texas.]    Bear these items in mind and remember that Congress enfranchised the  Indians, assuming its authority upon the ground that they are wards of  the nation; that the Negroes were enfranchised by Federal amendment;  that the constitutions of all states not in the list of the original  thirteen, automatically extended the vote to men; that in the original  colonial territory, the chief struggle occurred over the elimination  of the land-owning qualifications and that a total vote necessary  to give the franchise to non-landowners did not exceed fifty to  seventy-five thousand in any state.    Let it also not be forgotten that the vote is the free-will offering  of our forty-eight states to any man who chooses to make this land his  home. Let it not be overlooked that millions of immigrant voters  have been added to our electorate within a generation, men mainly  uneducated and all moulded by European traditions, and let no man lose  sight of the fact that women of American birth, education and ideals  must appeal to these men for their enfranchisement. No humiliation  could be more complete, unless we add the amazing fact that political  leaders in Congress and legislatures are willing to drive their wives  and daughters to beg the consent of these men to their political  liberty.    The makers of the Federal Constitution foresaw the necessity of  referring important and intricate questions to a more intelligent body  than the masses of the people and so provided for the amendment of the  Constitution by referendum to the legislatures of the several states.  Why should women be denied the privilege thus established? The United  States is one land and one people. All the states have the same  institutions, customs and ideals.    Woman suffrage has been caught in a snarl of state constitutional  obstructions, inefficient election laws and the misapplied theory  of States Rights. It is a combination which has so far retarded the  normal progress of the movement in this democratic land that other  countries have already outstripped it. Under these circumstances  Congress should extricate the woman suffrage question from this tangle  by way of honorable reparation for the injustices unintentionally put  upon the only unenfranchised citizens left in our Republic, and women  should insist upon their enfranchisement by amendment to the Federal  Constitution as their self-respecting duty.          CHAPTER IV.    THE STORY OF THE 1916 REFERENDA      Constitutional amendments were submitted to the voters of three states  in 1916, namely, Iowa, where the vote was taken June 5th on Primary  Day; South Dakota and West Virginia, where the vote was taken at the  general election in November. More than one influential newspaper  editorially discussed the returns with the comment that \"the people\"  of three states had refused to extend the suffrage to women.  An investigation unveils some ugly facts and raises significant  questions.    In 1882 a prohibition constitutional amendment was adopted by a large  majority in Iowa and was promptly set aside by the supreme court upon  a technicality. The wet and dry question has been a vexed political  issue ever since. The state now has prohibition by statutory  enactment. A constitutional amendment is pending, having passed the  Legislature of 1914, and is due to pass the Legislature of 1916.  The \"wets\" believing that women would generally support the proposed  prohibition amendment were extremely active in opposing the suffrage  amendment. Although the suffragists kept their question distinctly  separate from prohibition, the wet and dry issue, it was generally  admitted, would prove a determining factor.    Every judge of the Supreme Court, the United States Senators, the  Governor, most of the men prominent in Republican and Democratic  politics, most of the clergymen, most of the press and every woman's  state organization espoused the suffrage amendment.    Men familiar with Iowa politics advised the suffrage campaigners early  and late and all the time between that it was unnecessary to conduct  an intensive campaign as \"everybody believed in it.\"    Yet despite this omnipresent optimism thousands of women gave  every possibility of their lives for months before to arouse public  sentiment, instruct and acquaint the men and women of the state  concerning the question.    The amendment was lost by about 10,000 votes. Were four of the  ninety-nine counties (Dubuque, Clinton, Scott and Des Moines counties)  lying along the Mississippi River, not included in the returns, the  state would have been carried for woman suffrage. It is instructive  to inquire what kind of population occupied the four counties which  defeated it. The following table gives the answer:    ========================================================  |             |          |         |         | Total   |  |             |          |         | Total   | German, |  |      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13575"],[0,"How to Observe in Archaeology (#5)"],[1,"to avoid creases. The  foil should then be floated on water, hollow back up, and blazing  sealing-wax dropped into it to back it. The resulting positive can be  then stuck on card.    For plaster casts of coins the face should be dusted with French  chalk, as also a smooth bed of plasticine; the coin can then be  pressed in safely without any possible risk, and afterward plaster  cast in the mould. Sealing-wax is said to be sharper, but there is a  risk of its sticking to the coin. If it is used, breathe hard on the  coin, or wet it, before impressing; and when first set lift it  slightly to detach it, and then replace till cold. Or tin-foil may be  used, as in making positives; but, instead of floating on water,  press plasticine on the foil while it is still on the object.    For curved surfaces, as cylinders, any of these methods can be used;  the plasticine is the more successful.    In all casting of plaster on a small scale, use a soft camel-hair  brush. Mix the plaster in the palm of the hand with a knife, take up  some of the wettest to brush over the face of the moulds (a dozen  scarabs or small coins done at once); then put he brush in water, and  take up thicker plaster with a pocket-knife to drop on as a backing.  This avoids air bubbles without using too weak a plaster.        Copying hieroglyphic inscriptions.  Where possible a wet or a dry squeeze should be taken of any  inscription. When hand copying is necessary, the main matter is to  get the cartouches of king's names accurately, and the date at the  beginning, examining specially whether single strokes, I I I I, have  been connected above, n n, forming the ten sign. The main difficulty  for any one not knowing the 800 signs is to distinguish between those  that are alike, especially when damaged. For this purpose the  commonest signs that may be confused are here placed together, so  that the essential points of difference may be noticed. A small cross  is placed here by small points of distinction which might escape  notice.    [Illustration I: SOME HIEROGLYPHIC SIGNS LIABLE TO BE CONFUSED WITH  EACH OTHER]     6. Photography.    The camera and material have been described under outfit.    Lighting and preparation of objects is a main element of success.  When first looking over any ruins, make a list of every view wanted,  with the time of day when the sun will be right for it. Then follow  the time-table, and so get the best lighting all in one day.    For movable stones or figures place them in half-shade, as a doorway,  and then tilt every way until the best lighting is found, fix them in  that position, and then set up the camera square with them.    The camera should usually be fixed to look downward vertically, and  then variation up to 40 degrees can be got by the legs. Hold the  camera in the right position, keeping the legs off the ground, and  then drop the legs to find their own place; thus very skew positions  can be fixed quickly.    Small objects are best laid on black velvet, and taken vertically.  Scraps of charcoal are useful to prop them in exact positions. A  sheet of white paper stuck on a leg of the stand may be useful to  prevent shadows being too heavy. Where outline, and not flat detail,  is wanted, then a light ground is best; the most perfect is a sheet  of ground glass with white paper a foot or two below it. If the  ground glass cannot be had, a good substitute-also useful for a  camera glass-is plain glass with a sheet of tissue paper (or the  packing paper of films) stuck on with paraffin wax.    The dressing of objects to show up clearly is often needful. Incised  objects can be filled in with charcoal powder if light, or chalk if  dark; in any case a coarse powder, so as not to stain the object. For  faint cutting on glass or crystal go over the lines with 'China ink  in a pen, so as to cover them. Harden the ink in the sun, and then  gently wipe with a damp finger until all the excess is removed and  only the roughness of the lines remains black. On large objects light  dust or sand is often useful, to make relief clearer.    For objects in a bad light, or in the interior of tombs, reflected  light must be used. Lids of biscuit tins serve well; a lid in the sun  sixty feet off, and another lid reflecting the light on to a wall,  will suffice for a two minutes' exposure of a slow plate. Three or  four successive reflections into a totally dark chamber will suffice  in five or six minutes.    When an important subject cannot be revisited it is well to take  duplicates; the camera should be shifted laterally a few inches for a  near object, or a few feet for a distant view, and then the two films  will form a stereograph, if both succeed.    In arranging groups of small objects, put together what will go in a  three-inch circle, and minor pieces around, and then the best in the  middle can be printed direct on lantern slides.     7. Preservation and Packing.    While travelling little can be done for preserving objects. Papyrus  rolls should be wrapped at once in a damp handkerchief, to be  carried, and then wrapped in paper, packed in a tin box, and filled  round with cotton wool. Small papyri can be safely damped in a wet  cloth, and flattened out between the leaves of a book; secure one  edge straight in the hinge, and gradually press flat and secure by  advancing leaves over it. Glass, if perfect, should be packed in tins  with wool; old food or tobacco tins do well for tender things.    Flint implements and coins, though hardy, should be saved from  grinding by wrapping in waste paper.    Ivory, if it has been buried, is very liable to flake. The cure is to  soak it in paraffin wax; but temporarily it is secured by winding  cotton thread round it in many directions. Some anoint it with  vaseline, but if vaseline penetrates the ivory, it will not take up  paraffin or gelatine later. Tender wood may be likewise saved.    A much-cracked glazed jar was packed by winding string round it in  all directions, with tufts of wool under the string.    A whole mummy in most fragile condition, so that it could not be  lifted, was made up solid with 40 lb. of paraffin wax which was  melted out of it afterwards in England, making hardly any change. If  contracted burials should be preserved, dust carefully, splash on  about 5 lb. of paraffin wax heated to smoking-point. When cold,  detach from soil, turn over, paraffin the lower side, and build up  weak parts with a sludge of melted paraffin and sand, nearly chilled.  About 8 to 10 lb. of wax will do the whole. The skull should be  packed separately. Pad all hollows of the body with soft rag to  spread pressure in packing. Paraffin wax is the best preservative as  it is tough, and may be used as a coat over an object for safety.  When not needed it can be cut away, or melted away, and cleaned off  completely with benzol. It should be melted in an iron saucepan, as  solder will give way if it is superheated. As it melts at about 120  degrees F., and boils at about 600 degrees F., it can be greatly  superheated, and used when smoking, so as to penetrate deeply into  wood or porous material. It is perfect for strengthening skulls; most  rotten examples slopped with paraffin, and finally soused for a few  seconds so as entirely to cover the bone in and out, will travel  safely, if not crushed.    Boxes must always have corner posts, inside or out; see that the  sides are nailed up to the edges to the posts, or the lid or bottom  may part by the side splitting. See that all nails--except for the  lid--are driven slanting alternately one way and reversed, this  prevents sides or bottom drawing off. Nail the lid with many short  nails, so that it can be raised without splitting.    To secure heavy objects in a mixed box, an inverted rough stool is  the best, the cross piece on the object below, and the sides coming  up to the lid. If cross bars are nailed in a box, damage may be done  to an object in forcing the bars loose. It is often best to put heavy  and light things in the same box, to equalize weights in journeying;  if well secured, a mixed boxful travels well. Be very careful that a  wedge-shaped stone cannot force itself loose by repeated jolts, or it  may split a box.    Slabs of stone ire best packed in open shallow boxes face down on  straw or wool, secured by a few diagonal cross bars on the top, as  then they do not need to be opened for customs. All stones of regular  form should be supported at a fifth of the length from each end. No  bedding on a box is worth anything, as the box will bend more than  the stone, and the strain will all come on the middle. Very heavy  blocks are best with sacking on the face, and roped round in various  parts.    Pottery is most difficult to pack safely. For large jars, mark the  points of contact on the box, and nail on cushions of old cloth  stuffed hard with straw, so as to pad the jar on all sides; make sure  that it cannot twist about into a diagonal position off the pads.  Long boxes, five or six feet, with three or four cross divisions, are  best. Begin packing, say four pots with straw, at one end of the box,  press up a cross board tight on them, and nail through the sides:  then another batch likewise; about one inch thick of hard-pressed  straw is needful at each contact. Twist straw into rough bands, and  wind it round each pot. Fill up corners to prevent the bands shifting  loose. Empty small tins make good stuffing for blank spaces. Old  newspapers torn to bits and rolled into balls make good packing for  pots and hold them firmly, but this method is dangerous if the  packing becomes wetted. Pots should always be packed tight. Old  sacking or cotton stuff may be tied on over the mouth of large pots,  to prevent straw slipping in, and loosening the packing.    Bronzes and coins should not be cleaned in any way, till in a settled  work place.     8. Forgeries and. Buying.    Most travellers wish to buy"]]]
