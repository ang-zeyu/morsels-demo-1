Hawkins first went down the Guinea Coast of Africa,  'where he trafiqued with the Negroes, and tooke of them Oliphants'  teeth, and other commodities which that place yeeldeth; and so arriving  on the coast of Brasil, used there such discretion, and behaved himselfe  so wisely with those savage people, that he grew into great familiaritie  and friendship with them. Insomuch that in his 2 voyage one of the  savage kings of the Countrey of Brasil was contented to take ship with  him, and to be transported hither into England. This kinge was presented  unto King Henry 8. The King and all the Nobilitie did not a little  marvel; for in his cheeks were holes, and therein small bones planted,  which in his Countrey was reputed for a great braverie.' The poor  Brazilian monarch died on his voyage back, which made Hawkins fear for  the life of Martin Cockeram, whom he had left in Brazil as a hostage.  However, the Brazilians took Hawkins's word for it and released  Cockeram, who lived another forty years in Plymouth. 'Olde M. William  Haukins' was the father of Sir John Hawkins, Drake's companion in arms,  whom we shall meet later. He was also the grandfather of Sir Richard  Hawkins, another naval hero, and of the second William Hawkins, one of  the founders of the greatest of all chartered companies, the Honourable  East India Company.    Hawkins knew what he was about. 'Master Hore' did not. Hore was a  well-meaning, plausible fellow, good at taking up new-fangled ideas, bad  at carrying them out, and the very cut of a wildcat company-promoter,  except for his honesty. He persuaded 'divers young lawyers of the Innes  of Court and Chancerie' to go to Newfoundland. A hundred and twenty men  set off in this modern ship of fools, which ran into Newfoundland at  night and was wrecked. There were no provisions; and none of the 'divers  lawyers' seems to have known how to catch a fish. After trying to live  on wild fruit they took to eating each other, in spite of Master Hore,  who stood up boldly and warned them of the 'Fire to Come.' Just then a  French fishing smack came in; whereupon the lawyers seized her, put her  wretched crew ashore, and sailed away with all the food she had. The  outraged Frenchmen found another vessel, chased the lawyers back to  England, and laid their case before the King, who 'out of his Royall  Bountie' reimbursed the Frenchmen and let the 'divers lawyers' go scot  free.      Hawkins and Hore, and others like them, were the heroes of travellers'  tales. But what was the ordinary life of the sailor who went down to the  sea in the ships of the Tudor age? There are very few quite authentic  descriptions of life afloat before the end of the sixteenth century; and  even then we rarely see the ship and crew about their ordinary work.  Everybody was all agog for marvellous discoveries. Nobody, least of all  a seaman, bothered his head about describing the daily routine on board.  We know, however, that it was a lot of almost incredible hardship. Only  the fittest could survive. Elizabethan landsmen may have been quite as  prone to mistake comfort for civilization as most of the world is said  to be now. Elizabethan sailors, when afloat, most certainly were not;  and for the simple reason that there was no such thing as real comfort  in a ship.    Here are a few verses from the oldest genuine English sea-song known.  They were written down in the fifteenth century, before the discovery  of America, and were probably touched up a little by the scribe. The  original manuscript is now in Trinity College, Cambridge. It is a true  nautical composition--a very rare thing indeed; for genuine sea-songs  didn't often get into print and weren't enjoyed by landsmen when they  did. The setting is that of a merchantman carrying passengers whose  discomforts rather amuse the 'schippemenne.'       Anon the master commandeth fast     To his ship-men in all the hast[e],     To dresse them [line up] soon about the mast           Their takeling to make.       With _Howe! Hissa!_ then they cry,     'What howe! mate thou standest too nigh,     Thy fellow may not haul thee by:'           Thus they begin to crake [shout].       A boy or twain anon up-steyn [go aloft]     And overthwart the sayle-yerde leyn [lie]     _Y-how! taylia!_ the remnant cryen [cry]           And pull with all their might.       Bestow the boat, boat-swain, anon,     That our pylgrymms may play thereon;     For some are like to cough and groan           Ere it be full midnight.       Haul the bowline! Now veer the sheet;     Cook, make ready anon our meat!     Our pylgrymms have no lust to eat:           I pray God give them rest.       Go to the helm! What ho! no neare[r]!     Steward, fellow! a pot of beer!     Ye shall have, Sir, with good cheer,           Anon all of the best.       _Y-howe! Trussa!_ Haul in the brailes!     Thou haulest not! By God, thou failes[t]     O see how well our good ship sails!           And thus they say among.              *       *       *       *       *       Thys meane'whyle the pylgrymms lie,     And have their bowls all fast them by,     And cry after hot malvesy--           'Their health for to restore.'              *       *       *       *       *     Some lay their bookys on their knee,     And read so long they cannot see.     'Alas! mine head will split in three!'           Thus sayeth one poor wight.              *       *       *       *       *       A sack of straw were there right good;     For some must lay them in their hood:     I had as lief be in the wood,           Without or meat or drink!       For when that we shall go to bed,     The pump is nigh our beddes head:     A man he were as good be dead         As smell thereof the stynke!    _Howe--hissa!_ is still used aboard deepwater-men as _Ho--hissa!_  instead of _Ho--hoist away!_ _What ho, mate!_ is also known afloat,  though dying out. _Y-howe! taylia!_ is _Yo--ho! tally!_ or _Tally and  belay!_ which means hauling aft and making fast the sheet of a mainsail  or foresail. _What ho! no nearer!_ is _What ho! no higher_ now. But old  salts remember _no nearer!_ and it may be still extant. Seasickness  seems to have been the same as ever--so was the desperate effort to  pretend one was not really feeling it:       And cry after hot malvesy--       'Their health for to restore.'    Here is another sea-song, one sung by the sea-dogs themselves. The doubt  is whether the _Martial-men_ are Navy men, as distinguished from  merchant-service men aboard a king's ship, or whether they are soldiers  who want to take all sailors down a peg or two. This seems the more  probable explanation. Soldiers 'ranked' sailors afloat in the sixteenth  century; and Drake's was the first fleet in the world in which  seamen-admirals were allowed to fight a purely naval action.       We be three poor Mariners, newly come from the Seas,     We spend our lives in jeopardy while others live at ease.     We care not for those Martial-men that do our states disdain,     But we care for those Merchant-men that do our states maintain.    A third old sea-song gives voice to the universal complaint that  landsmen cheat sailors who come home flush of gold.       For Sailors they be honest men,       And they do take great pains,     But Land-men and ruffling lads       Do rob them of their gains.    Here, too, is some _Cordial Advice_ against the wiles of the sea,  addressed _To all rash young Men, who think to Advance their  decaying Fortunes by Navigation_, as most of the sea-dogs (and  gentlemen-adventurers like Gilbert, Raleigh, and Cavendish) tried to do.         You merchant men of Billingsgate,       I wonder how you thrive.     You bargain with men for six months       And pay them but for five.    This was an abuse that took a long time to die out. Even well on in the  nineteenth century, and sometimes even on board of steamers, victualling  was only by the lunar month though service went by the calendar.       A cursed cat with thrice three tails       Doth much increase our woe    is a poetical way of putting another seaman's grievance.    People who regret that there is such a discrepancy between genuine  sea-songs and shore-going imitations will be glad to know that the  _Mermaid_ is genuine, though the usual air to which it was sung afloat  was harsh and decidedly inferior to the one used ashore. This example of  the old 'fore-bitters' (so-called because sung from the fore-bitts, a  convenient mass of stout timbers near the foremast) did not luxuriate in  the repetitions of its shore-going rival: _With a comb and a glass in  her hand, her hand, her hand_, etc.       _Solo_.   On Friday morn as we set sail                    It was not far from land,                    Oh, there I spied a fair pretty maid                    With a comb and a glass in her hand.       _Chorus_. The stormy winds did blow,                    And the raging seas did roar,                    While we poor Sailors went to the tops                    And the land lubbers laid below.    The anonymous author of a curious composition entitled _The Complaynt of  Scotland_, written in 1548, seems to be the only man who took more  interest in the means than in the ends of seamanship. He was undoubtedly  a landsman. But he loved the things of the sea; and his work is well  worth reading as a vocabulary of the lingo that was used on board a  Tudor ship. When the seamen sang it sounded like 'an echo in a cave.'  Many of the outlandish words were Mediterranean terms which the  scientific Italian navigators had brought north. Others were of Oriental  origin, which was very natural in view of the long connection"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12873"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Its construction is  perfectly simple, and at the cost of a few shillings in its  erection. The pot consists of an unglazed inverted vessel,  manufactured at potteries for the use of sugar-bakers, and placed  through a hole in a triangular board, resting upon two ledges,  occupying a corner in a kitchen or any other apartment. In the  inside of the pot a bushel of the whitest sand is to be introduced;  which sand, after being washed in a clean tub with about three  changes of water, to dissolve and clear away the clayey matter, is  to be mixed with half a peck of finely-bruised charcoal. This will  fill about one-third of the pot; but before the sand is placed in  the vessel, the small hole at the bottom of the pot should have an  oyster-shell placed over it, with the convex side uppermost, to  prevent the sand washing through. This filters foul water perfectly  pellucid and clear very quickly, as I have seen its effects for  years with the most perfect success. When the sand becomes foul by  time, it can be taken out and washed, or fresh materials can be  repeated; great care should be observed not to put more water in the  pot than your vessel underneath will receive.    JNO. FIELD.    *       *       *       *       *      _Effects of Lightning_.      The analogy between the electric spark, and more especially of the  explosive discharge of the Leyden jar, with atmospheric lightning  and thunder, is too obvious to have escaped notice, even in the  early periods of electrical research. It had been observed by Dr.  Wall and by Gray, and still more pointedly remarked by the Abbe  Nollet. Dr. Franklin was so impressed with the many points of  resemblance between lightning and electricity, that he was convinced  of their identity, and determined to ascertain by direct experiment  the truth of his bold conjecture. A spire which was erecting at  Philadelphia he conceived might assist him in this inquiry; but,  while waiting for its completion, the sight of a boy's kite, which  had been raised for amusement, immediately suggested to him a more  ready method of attaining his object. Having constructed a kite by  stretching a large silk handkerchief over two sticks in the form of  a cross, on the first appearance of an approaching storm, in June  1752, he went out into a field, accompanied by his son, to whom  alone he had imparted his design. Having raised his kite, and  attached a key to the lower end of the hempen string, he insulated  it by fastening it to a post, by means of silk, and waited with  intense anxiety for the result. A considerable time elapsed without  the apparatus giving any sign of electricity, even although a dense  cloud, apparently charged with lightning, had passed over the spot  on which they stood. Franklin was just beginning to despair of  success, when his attention was caught by the bristling up of some  loose fibres on the hempen cord; he immediately presented his  knuckle to the key, and received an electric spark. Overcome with  the emotion {42} inspired by this decisive evidence of the great  discovery he had achieved, he heaved a deep sigh, and conscious of  an immortal name, felt that he could have been content if that  moment had been his last. The rain now fell in torrents, and wetting  the string, rendered it conducting in its whole length; so that  electric sparks were now collected from it in great abundance.    It should be noticed, however, that about a month before Franklin  had made these successful trials, some philosophers, in particular  Dalibard and De Lors, had obtained similar results in France, by  following the plan recommended by Franklin. But the glory of the  discovery is universally given to Franklin, as it was from his  suggestions that the methods of attaining it were originally  derived.    This important discovery was prosecuted with great ardour by  philosophers in every part of Europe. The first experimenters  incurred considerable risk in their attempts to draw down  electricity from the clouds, as was soon proved by the fatal  catastrophe, which, on the 6th of August, 1753, befel Professor  Richman, of Petersburg. He had constructed an apparatus for  observations on atmospherical electricity, and was attending a  meeting of the Academy of Sciences, when the sound of distant  thunder caught his ear. He immediately hastened home, taking with  him his engraver, Sokolow, in order that he might delineate the  appearances that should present themselves. While intent upon  examining the electrometer, a large globe of fire flashed from the  conducting rod, which was insulated, to the head of Richman, and  passing through his body, instantly deprived him of life. A red spot  was found on his forehead, where the electricity had entered, his  shoe was burst open, and part of his clothes singed. His companion  was struck down, and remained senseless for some time; the door-case  of the room was split, and the door itself torn off its hinges.    The protection of buildings from the effects of lightning, is the  most important practical application of the theory of electricity.  Conductors for this should be formed of metallic rods, pointed at  the upper extremity, and placed so as to project a few feet above  the highest part of the building they are intended to secure; they  should be continued without interruption till they descend into the  ground, below the foundation of the house. Copper is preferable to  iron as the material for their construction, being less liable to  destruction by rust, or by fusion, and possessing also a greater  conducting power. The size of the rods should be from half an inch  to an inch in diameter, and the point should be gilt, or made of  platina, that it may be more effectually preserved from corrosion.  An important condition in the protecting conductor is, that no  interruption should exist in its continuity from top to bottom; and  advantage will result from connecting together by strips of metal  all the leaden water pipes, or other considerable masses of metal in  or about the building, so as to form one continuous system of  conductors, for carrying the electricity by different channels to  the ground. The lower end of the conductors should be carried down  into the earth till it reaches either water, or at least a moist  stratum.--_Library of Useful Knowledge._                     *       *       *       *       *          The Sketch-Book.    THE MYSTERIOUS TAILOR.    _A Romance of High Holborn._      It came to pass that, towards the close of 1826, I found occasion to  change my tailor, and by chance, or the recommendation of friends--I  cannot now remember which--applied to one who vegetated in that  particular region of the metropolis where the rivers of  Museum-street and Drury-lane (to adopt the language of metaphor)  flow into and form the capacious estuary of High Holborn. Whoever  has sailed along, or cast anchor in this confluence, must have seen  the individual I allude to. He sits--I should perhaps say sat,  inasmuch as he is since defunct--bolt upright, with a pen behind his  ear, in the centre of a dingy, spectral-looking shop, quaintly hung  round with clothes, of divers forms and patterns, in every stage of  existence--from the first crude conception of the incipient surtout  or pantaloons, down to the last glorious touch that immortalizes the  artist. His figure is slim and undersized; his cheeks are sallow,  with two furrows on each side his nose, filled not unfrequently with  snuff; his eyes project like lobsters', and cast their shifting  glances about with a vague sort of mysterious intelligence; and his  voice--his startling, solemn, unearthly voice--seems hoarse with  sepulchral vapours, and puts forth its tones like the sighing of the  wind among tombs. With regard to his dress, it is in admirable  keeping with his countenance. He wears a black coat, fashioned in  the mould of other times, with large cloth buttons and flowing  skirts; drab inexpressibles, fastened at the knee with brass  buckles; gaiters, which, reaching no higher than the calf of the  leg, set up independent claims to eccentricity and exact  consideration on their own account; creaking, square-toed shoes; and  a hat, broad in front, pinched up at the sides, verging to an angle  behind, and worn close over the forehead, with the lower part  resting on the nose. His manner is equally peculiar; it cannot be  called vulgar, nor yet genteel--for it is too passive for the one,  and too pompous for the other; it forms, say, a sort of compromise  between the two, with a slight infusion of pedantry that greatly  adds to its effect.    On reaching this oddity's abode, I at once proceeded to business;  and was promised, in reply, the execution of my order on the  customary terms of credit. Thus far is strictly natural. The clothes  came home, and so, with admirable punctuality, did the bill; but the  death of a valued friend having withdrawn me, soon afterwards, from  London, six months elapsed; at the expiration of which time I was  refreshed, as agreed on, by a pecuniary application from my tailor.  Perhaps I should here mention, to the better understanding of my  tale, that I am a medical practitioner, of somewhat nervous  temperament, derived partly from inheritance, and partly from an  inveterate indulgence of the imagination. My income, too--which  seldom or never encumbers a surgeon who has not yet done walking the  hospitals--is"]]]
