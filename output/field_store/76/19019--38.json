The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun        The frumious Bandersnatch!\"      He took his vorpal sword in hand:        Long time the manxome foe he sought.    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,        And stood awhile in thought.      And as in uffish thought he stood,        The Jabberwock with eyes of flame,    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,        And burbled as it came!      One, two! One, two! And through, and through        The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!    He left it dead, and with its head        He went galumphing back.      \"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?        Come to my arms, my beamish boy!    Oh, frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\"        He chortled in his joy.

And then in sadness to his love        The Nyum-Nyum weeping said,    I know no reason why the sea        Should not be white or red.      I know no reason why the sea        Should not be red, I say;    And why the slithy Bandersnatch        Has not been round to-day.      He swore he'd call at two o'clock,        And now it's half-past four.    \"Stay,\" said the Nyum-Nyum's love, \"I think        I hear him at the door.\"      In twenty minutes in there came        A creature black as ink,    Which put its feet upon a chair        And called for beer to drink.      They gave him porter in a tub,        But, \"Give me more!\" he cried;    And then he drew a heavy sigh,        And laid him down, and died.      He died, and in the Nyum-Nyum's cave        A cry of mourning rose;    The Nyum-Nyum sobbed a gentle sob,        And slily blew his nose.      The Nyum-Nyum's love, we need not state,        Was overwhelmed and sad;    She said, \"Oh, take the corpse away,        Or you will drive me mad!\"      The Nyum-Nyum in his supple arms        Took up the gruesome weight,    And, with a cry of bitter fear,        He threw it at his mate.      And then he wept, and tore his hair,        And threw it in the sea,    And loudly sobbed with streaming eyes        That such a thing could be.      The ox, that mumbled in his stall,        Perspired and gently sighed,    And then, in sympathy, it fell        Upon its back and died.      The hen that sat upon her eggs,        With high ambition fired,    Arose in simple majesty,        And, with a cluck, expired.      The jubejube bird, that carolled there,        Sat down upon a post,    And with a reverential caw,        Gave up its little ghost.      And ere its kind and loving life        Eternally had ceased,    The donkey, in the ancient barn,        In agony deceased.      The raven, perched upon the elm,        Gave forth a scraping note,    And ere the sound had died away,        Had cut its tuneful throat.      The Nyum-Nyum's love was sorrowful;        And, after she had cried,    She, with a brand-new carving-knife,        Committed suicide.      \"Alas!\" the Nyum-Nyum said, \"alas!        With thee I will not part,\"    And straightway seized a rolling-pin        And drove it through his heart.      The mourners came and gathered up        The bits that lay about;    But why the massacre had been,        They could not quite make out.      One said there was a mystery        Connected with the deaths;    But others thought the silent ones        Perhaps had lost their breaths.      The doctor soon arrived, and viewed        The corpses as they lay;    He could not give them life again,        So he was heard to say.      But, oh! it was a horrid sight;        It made the blood run cold,    To see the bodies carried off        And covered up with mould.      The Toves across the briny sea        Wept buckets-full of tears;    They were relations of the dead,        And had been friends for years.      The Jabberwock upon the hill        Gave forth a gloomy wail,    When in his airy seat he sat,        And told the awful tale.      And who can wonder that it made        That loving creature cry?    For he had done the dreadful work        And caused the things to die.      That Jabberwock was passing bad--        That Jabberwock was wrong,    And with this verdict I conclude        One portion of my song.                              _Anonymous_.          UFFIA      When sporgles spanned the floreate mead        And cogwogs gleet upon the lea,    Uffia gopped to meet her love        Who smeeged upon the equat sea.      Dately she walked aglost the sand;        The boreal wind seet in her face;    The moggling waves yalped at her feet;        Pangwangling was her pace.                              _Harriet R. White_.          SPIRK  TROLL-DERISIVE      The Crankadox leaned o'er the edge of the moon,        And wistfully gazed on the sea    Where the Gryxabodill madly whistled a tune        To the air of \"Ti-fol-de-ding-dee.\"      The quavering shriek of the Fliupthecreek        Was fitfully wafted afar    To the Queen of the Wunks as she powdered her cheek        With the pulverized rays of a star.      The Gool closed his ear on the voice of the Grig,        And his heart it grew heavy as lead    As he marked the Baldekin adjusting his wig        On the opposite side of his head;      And the air it grew chill as the Gryxabodill        Raised his dank, dripping fins to the skies    To plead with the Plunk for the use of her bill        To pick the tears out of his eyes.      The ghost of the Zhack flitted by in a trance;        And the Squidjum hid under a tub    As he heard the loud hooves of the Hooken advance        With a rub-a-dub-dub-a-dub dub!      And the Crankadox cried as he laid down and died,        \"My fate there is none to bewail!\"    While the Queen of the Wunks drifted over the tide        With a long piece of crape to her tail.                              _James Whitcomb Riley_.          THE WHANGO TREE      The woggly bird sat on the whango tree,        Nooping the rinkum corn,    And graper and graper, alas! grew he,        And cursed the day he was born.    His crute was clum and his voice was rum,        As curiously thus sang he,    \"Oh, would I'd been rammed and eternally clammed        Ere I perched on this whango tree.\"      Now the whango tree had a bubbly thorn,        As sharp as a nootie's bill,    And it stuck in the woggly bird's umptum lorn        And weepadge, the smart did thrill.    He fumbled and cursed, but that wasn't the worst,        For he couldn't at all get free,    And he cried, \"I am gammed, and injustibly nammed        On the luggardly whango tree.\"      And there he sits still, with no worm in his bill,        Nor no guggledom in his nest;    He is hungry and bare, and gobliddered with care,        And his grabbles give him no rest;    He is weary and sore and his tugmut is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9408"],[0,"By Water to the Columbian Exposition (#4)"],[1,"abode, a multitude of  curious spectators had assembled in order to view the handsome yacht. I  made the observation that during our entire voyage the \"Marguerite,\"  wherever she made her appearance, was universally admired.    The important city of Rochester is situated on the Genesee River, seven  miles south of its entrance into Lake Ontario. It is one of the leading  manufacturing cities of the country, having more than 150,000 inhabitants.  In 1802 it was founded by Colonel Nathaniel Rochester, a representative  pioneer of the Genesee River Valley. In 1834 it received its charter as a  city, and has since increased in population and importance with marvelous  rapidity. The fertility of the surrounding country and the splendid  water-power furnished by the Genesee River, together with unexcelled  transportation facilities, have contributed largely to its growth.    Both in the latter part of the afternoon and evening, we deserted the  yacht for the purpose of admiring the various beauties and points of  interest, which give this town such a far spread reputation.    We received the conviction that Rochester, in fact, deserves its fame.  Covering an area of about seventeen square miles, it is laid out chiefly  in squares, with streets from sixty to one hundred feet wide, shaded by  beautiful trees. It abounds in handsome and tasteful residences, which are  for the most part surrounded by carefully tended lawns and gardens. Its  fire-proof office buildings and warehouses, are a credit to the city; only  few, even in the metropolis, are equal to them in magnificence.    In the center of the city are the upper Falls of the Genesee, a  perpendicular cataract of ninety-six feet, over which Sam Patch made his  last and fatal leap.    To the prominent public institutions of Rochester belong the State  Industrial School, two large hospitals, an Institution for Deaf-Mutes, and  charitable organizations of every description. The principal business  thoroughfare, Main Street, is in the heart of the city, and crosses the  river over a handsome iron bridge.    The manufactures of Rochester are extensive and varied. In early years  flour was the chief product, giving it the title \"Flour City;\" there being  no less than eighteen mills within its limits. Rochester might be also  appropriately styled the \"Flower City,\" for its nursery trade is hardly  surpassed by that of any other place in the world. The suburbs are highly  cultivated, having 4,000 acres of fruit trees, and nurseries containing  from 250 to 500 acres.    Other important industries are cotton and paper mills; oil refineries;  boot and shoe, clothing, furniture, perfumery and tobacco manufactories.    A feature that attracts thousands of visitors daily, is the great Powers  Art Gallery, the private property of Mr. D.W. Powers, occupying the  greater part of the two upper floors pertaining to the Powers Building.    In fact, a plentitude of resources makes the city interesting to the  tourist.    The next day, when \"morn was blushing in the sky,\" we bade farewell to  Rochester; and, sailing on the other sixty-mile level, we continued our  journey through a charming region past Greece, Spencerport, King & Adams,  Cooley's Basin, and arrived at the attractive village of Brockport.  Beautifully situated in the midst of a country teeming with abundance and  inhabited by a prosperous and contented population, it contains many  features of interest. Here is located a State Normal School, and also  several extensive manufactories of agricultural implements.    Passing Holley, Hulberton and Hindsburg, we came to Albion, the capital of  Orleans County. The latter village is nicely laid out with wide streets  and shaded by large trees. It contains many handsome residences and public  buildings.    Having proceeded more westward, beyond Eagle Harbor and Knowlesville, we  caught sight of the pleasant town of Medina, about midway between  Rochester and Buffalo, noted for its quarries of dark-red sandstone.  Located in the midst of a fine fruit country, it has the reputation of  being one of the best fruit markets in the State. Speeding through the  thriving villages of Middleport, Reynall's Basin and Cataract Springs, we  neared a deep ravine, through which the Erie Canal passes, following a  natural waterway. Here we met the most remarkable drop of the canal, in  its chain of five continuous double locks, resembling a flight of stairs.    Entering these, the \"Marguerite\" gradually rose higher and higher; and  when quitting the last of them, she had been lifted up to an elevation of  sixty feet by these five locks, and if we had not observed the busy hands  working for our ascent, we might have been inclined to imagine that an  invisible cloud was slowly carrying us to unknown regions on high.    We made _Lockport_ our resting-place for the night; since the sun had  wheeled his broad disk already down into the west and the heavens were  brightened only by the parting smiles of the day.    Going on shore, we visited Lockport, a prosperous city with about 20,000  inhabitants, which is the center of a large paper and pulp industry.    A five hours' journey on Saturday morning, July 29th, past Pendleton,  Picardsville, Martinsville, Tonawanda and Lower Black Rock, completed our  charming trip on the Erie Canal, which has from Schenectady to Buffalo a  length of 323 miles.    The construction of this great artificial waterway, in all nearly 350  miles long, having an elevation of about 500 feet above tide water, made  by seventy-two locks, was commenced in 1817, and its completion took place  in 1825. Although this immense undertaking has caused an expense of  $50,000,000, the State of New York has made an excellent investment with  that sum of money; since by means of the Erie Canal the domestic trade  between the large western inland towns and the eastern seaports,  especially the metropolis, is considerably facilitated. This traffic will  receive a still greater importance, and can be more advantageously carried  on, when the plan of utilizing the electric current for the driving power  of canal-boats--a project recently tested by experiments--has been  successfully executed.    Prior to 1857, this waterway was used for both trade and passenger  transportation. Since the introduction of railroad communication, however,  the canal has been the medium of conveying merchandise only; wherefore,  our interesting trip on the steam-yacht \"Marguerite\" is one of a few  exceptions to the ordinary routine of the Erie Canal.        CHAPTER II.    SOJOURN IN BUFFALO AND VISIT TO NIAGARA FALLS, FROM JULY 29TH, 1.30 P.M.,  TO AUGUST 2ND, 7 A.M.      It was a bright and sunny day; the atmosphere being purified by a strong  but refreshing breeze. As the noonday sun poured his brilliant rays on the  towering hills which adorn the luxuriant banks of the canal, it was  announced that in the distance there could be discerned the dark line  which indicated our approach to the verdant tract encompassing the  thriving city of _Buffalo_, the terminus of our voyage on the Erie Canal.    While the boat was speeding along, this point upon which our attention was  chiefly fixed, became more cognizable with every minute. Rising upwards to  our left we could perceive domes of the most graceful proportions,  towering structures, for number and form beyond my power to describe. On  the other side, there lay spread before us, in vast expanse, the unrivaled  water front which skirts the city of Buffalo, extending two and one-half  miles along the shore of Lake Erie and two and one-half miles along  Niagara River.    As we entered the harbor of Buffalo, which is considered the largest and  finest on the lake, we were soon made acquainted with scenes and incidents  that have no common fascination; in fact, one must be surprised at the  tremendous amount of activity displayed here. The scores of huge grain  elevators, having a total capacity of 8,000,000 bushels, and the mammoth  warehouses lining the water fronts reminded one of New York and Brooklyn.    Large steamers and sailing vessels, of every description, are being loaded  and discharged; powerful steam-hoists in operation on the docks; immense  quantities of freight and merchandise in process of transfer to and from  the railroad cars; and bustle everywhere; while hundreds of pleasure-boats  and small crafts, of every conceivable variety, may be seen as far as the  eye can reach. There we saw the trim and dainty shell, with its arrow-like  prow, darting through the quiet coves; the saucy catamaran shooting, half  submerged, out before the wind; the cozy little steam-launches, all ready  to take their passengers to some suburban pleasure-ground; excursion  steamers, with flying banners and bands of music going and coming, and  mammoth propellers destined to carry thousands of tourists to the El  Dorado on Lake Michigan's blue waters.    It will not be difficult to understand why Buffalo has attained commercial  supremacy in Western New York, if you add to this never ceasing activity,  betokening business, the enormous canal traffic; for it is here where  innumerable canal-boats are weighted with the rich products of the west,  carrying a large floating population of boatmen's families.    Before selecting our mooring place in Buffalo Creek, which can be  navigated for about one mile, we sailed to the breakwater, a solid wall  several feet high, having a length of 4,000 feet, which was erected at the  expense of some millions of dollars for the protection of the city from  being flooded by the unruly waters of Lake Erie.    While the tanks of the yacht were being filled with the limpid water of  the lake, we ascended the stairs leading to the top of the protecting  wall; for we all were anxious to become acquainted with the nature of the  billows that were to carry us many miles westward and nearer to our far  destination.    It was a glorious"]]]
