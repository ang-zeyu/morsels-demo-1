Often I  had stopped, on my way down the road, to hold my ear against the pole,  and, hearing its low moaning, I used to wonder what the paleface had  done to hurt it. Now I sat watching for each pole that glided by to be  the last one.    In this way I had forgotten my uncomfortable surroundings, when I heard  one of my comrades call out my name. I saw the missionary standing very  near, tossing candies and gums into our midst. This amused us all, and  we tried to see who could catch the most of the sweetmeats.    Though we rode several days inside of the iron horse, I do not recall a  single thing about our luncheons.    It was night when we reached the school grounds. The lights from the  windows of the large buildings fell upon some of the icicled trees that  stood beneath them. We were led toward an open door, where the  brightness of the lights within flooded out over the heads of the  excited palefaces who blocked our way. My body trembled more from fear  than from the snow I trod upon.    Entering the house, I stood close against the wall. The strong glaring  light in the large whitewashed room dazzled my eyes. The noisy hurrying  of hard shoes upon a bare wooden floor increased the whirring in my  ears. My only safety seemed to be in keeping next to the wall. As I was  wondering in which direction to escape from all this confusion, two warm  hands grasped me firmly, and in the same moment I was tossed high in  midair. A rosy-cheeked paleface woman caught me in her arms. I was both  frightened and insulted by such trifling. I stared into her eyes,  wishing her to let me stand on my own feet, but she jumped me up and  down with increasing enthusiasm. My mother had never made a plaything of  her wee daughter. Remembering this I began to cry aloud.    They misunderstood the cause of my tears, and placed me at a white table  loaded with food. There our party were united again. As I did not hush  my crying, one of the older ones whispered to me, \"Wait until you are  alone in the night.\"    It was very little I could swallow besides my sobs, that evening.    \"Oh, I want my mother and my brother Dawee! I want to go to my aunt!\" I  pleaded; but the ears of the palefaces could not hear me.    From the table we were taken along an upward incline of wooden boxes,  which I learned afterward to call a stairway. At the top was a quiet  hall, dimly lighted. Many narrow beds were in one straight line down the  entire length of the wall. In them lay sleeping brown faces, which  peeped just out of the coverings. I was tucked into bed with one of the  tall girls, because she talked to me in my mother tongue and seemed to  soothe me.    I had arrived in the wonderful land of rosy skies, but I was not happy,  as I had thought I should be. My long travel and the bewildering sights  had exhausted me. I fell asleep, heaving deep, tired sobs. My tears were  left to dry themselves in streaks, because neither my aunt nor my mother  was near to wipe them away.          II.    THE CUTTING OF MY LONG HAIR.      The first day in the land of apples was a bitter-cold one; for the snow  still covered the ground, and the trees were bare. A large bell rang for  breakfast, its loud metallic voice crashing through the belfry overhead  and into our sensitive ears. The annoying clatter of shoes on bare  floors gave us no peace. The constant clash of harsh noises, with an  undercurrent of many voices murmuring an unknown tongue, made a bedlam  within which I was securely tied. And though my spirit tore itself in  struggling for its lost freedom, all was useless.    A paleface woman, with white hair, came up after us. We were placed in a  line of girls who were marching into the dining room. These were Indian  girls, in stiff shoes and closely clinging dresses. The small girls wore  sleeved aprons and shingled hair. As I walked noiselessly in my soft  moccasins, I felt like sinking to the floor, for my blanket had been  stripped from my shoulders. I looked hard at the Indian girls, who  seemed not to care that they were even more immodestly dressed than I,  in their tightly fitting clothes. While we marched in, the boys entered  at an opposite door. I watched for the three young braves who came in  our party. I spied them in the rear ranks, looking as uncomfortable as I  felt. A small bell was tapped, and each of the pupils drew a chair from  under the table. Supposing this act meant they were to be seated, I  pulled out mine and at once slipped into it from one side. But when I  turned my head, I saw that I was the only one seated, and all the rest  at our table remained standing. Just as I began to rise, looking shyly  around to see how chairs were to be used, a second bell was sounded. All  were seated at last, and I had to crawl back into my chair again. I  heard a man's voice at one end of the hall, and I looked around to see  him. But all the others hung their heads over their plates. As I glanced  at the long chain of tables, I caught the eyes of a paleface woman upon  me. Immediately I dropped my eyes, wondering why I was so keenly watched  by the strange woman. The man ceased his mutterings, and then a third  bell was tapped. Every one picked up his knife and fork and began  eating. I began crying instead, for by this time I was afraid to venture  anything more.    But this eating by formula was not the hardest trial in that first day.  Late in the morning, my friend Judewin gave me a terrible warning.  Judewin knew a few words of English; and she had overheard the paleface  woman talk about cutting our long, heavy hair. Our mothers had taught us  that only unskilled warriors who were captured had their hair shingled  by the enemy. Among our people, short hair was worn by mourners, and  shingled hair by cowards!    We discussed our fate some moments, and when Judewin said, \"We have to  submit, because they are strong,\" I rebelled.    \"No, I will not submit! I will struggle first!\" I answered.    I watched my chance, and when no one noticed, I disappeared. I crept up  the stairs as quietly as I could in my squeaking shoes,--my moccasins  had been exchanged for shoes. Along the hall I passed, without knowing  whither I was going. Turning aside to an open door, I found a large room  with three white beds in it. The windows were covered with dark green  curtains, which made the room very dim. Thankful that no one was there,  I directed my steps toward the corner farthest from the door. On my  hands and knees I crawled under the bed, and cuddled myself in the dark  corner.    From my hiding place I peered out, shuddering with fear whenever I heard  footsteps near by. Though in the hall loud voices were calling my name,  and I knew that even Judewin was searching for me, I did not open my  mouth to answer. Then the steps were quickened and the voices became  excited. The sounds came nearer and nearer. Women and girls entered the  room. I held my breath and watched them open closet doors and peep  behind large trunks. Some one threw up the curtains, and the room was  filled with sudden light. What caused them to stoop and look under the  bed I do not know. I remember being dragged out, though I resisted by  kicking and scratching wildly. In spite of myself, I was carried  downstairs and tied fast in a chair.    I cried aloud, shaking my head all the while until I felt the cold  blades of the scissors against my neck, and heard them gnaw off one of  my thick braids. Then I lost my spirit. Since the day I was taken from  my mother I had suffered extreme indignities. People had stared at me. I  had been tossed about in the air like a wooden puppet. And now my long  hair was shingled like a coward's! In my anguish I moaned for my mother,  but no one came to comfort me. Not a soul reasoned quietly with me, as  my own mother used to do; for now I was only one of many little animals  driven by a herder.          III.    THE SNOW EPISODE.      A short time after our arrival we three Dakotas were playing in the  snowdrift. We were all still deaf to the English language, excepting  Judewin, who always heard such puzzling things. One morning we learned  through her ears that we were forbidden to fall lengthwise in the snow,  as we had been doing, to see our own impressions. However, before many  hours we had forgotten the order, and were having great sport in the  snow, when a shrill voice called us. Looking up, we saw an imperative  hand beckoning us into the house. We shook the snow off ourselves, and  started toward the woman as slowly as we dared.    Judewin said: \"Now the paleface is angry with us. She is going to punish  us for falling into the snow. If she looks straight into your eyes and  talks loudly, you must wait until she stops. Then, after a tiny pause,  say, 'No.'\" The rest of the way we practiced upon the little word \"no.\"    As it happened, Thowin was summoned to judgment first. The door shut  behind her with a click.    Judewin and I stood silently listening at the keyhole. The paleface  woman talked in very severe tones. Her words fell from her lips like  crackling embers, and her inflection ran up like the small end of a  switch. I understood her voice better than the things she was saying. I  was certain we had made her very impatient with us. Judewin heard enough  of the words to realize all too late that she had taught us the wrong  reply.    \"Oh, poor Thowin!\" she gasped, as she put both hands over her ears.    Just then I heard Thowin's tremulous answer, \"No.\"    With an angry exclamation, the woman gave her a hard spanking. Then she  stopped to say something. Judewin said it was this: \"Are you going to  obey my word the next time?\"    Thowin answered again with the only word at her command, \"No.\"    This time the woman meant her blows to smart, for the poor frightened  girl shrieked at the top of her voice. In the midst of the whipping the  blows ceased abruptly, and the woman asked another"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10380"],[0,"Bible Stories and Religious Classics (#5)"],[1,"herbs and fruits were then of great strength and  effect, they were pure and nourishing. But after the flood the earth was  weaker and brought not forth so good fruit, wherefore flesh was ordained  to be eaten. And then Noah began to labor for his livelihood with his  sons, and began to till the earth, to destroy briars and thorns and to  plant vines. And so on a time Noah had drunk so much of the wine that he  was drunk, and lay and slept. Ham, his middlest son, laughed and scorned  his father, and called his brethren to see, which rebuked Ham of his  folly and sin. And Noah awoke, and when he understood how Ham his son  had scorned him, he cursed him and also his son Canaan, and blessed Shem  and Japhet. All the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years and  then he died. And after his death his sons dealed all the world between  them, Shem had all Asia, Ham Africa, and Japhet all Europe. Thus was it  departed. Asia is the best part and is as much as the other two, and  that is in the east. Africa is the south part, and therein is Carthage  and many rich countries, therein be blue and black men. Ham had that to  his part Africa. The third part is Europe which is in the north and  west, therein is Greece, Rome, and Germany. In Europe reigneth now most  the christian law and faith, wherein is many a rich realm. And so was  the world departed to the three sons of Noah.          THE RAINBOW      Triumphal arch, that fill'st the sky    When storms prepare to part,  I ask not proud Philosophy    To teach me what thou art.    Still seem, as to my childhood's sight,    A midway station given,  For happy spirits to alight,    Betwixt the earth and heaven.    Can all that optics teach, unfold    Thy form to please me so,  As when I dreamt of gems and gold    Hid in thy radiant bow?    When science from creation's face    Enchantment's veil withdraws,  What lovely visions yield their place    To cold material laws!    And yet, fair bow, no fabling dreams,    But words of the Most High,  Have told why first thy robe of beams    Was woven in the sky.    When o'er the green undeluged earth    Heaven's covenant thou didst shine,  How came the world's gray fathers forth    To watch thy sacred sign!    And when its yellow lustre smiled    O'er mountains yet untrod,  Each mother held aloft her child    To bless the bow of God.    The earth to thee her incense yields,    The lark thy welcome sings,  When, glittering in the freshen'd fields,    The snowy mushroom springs.    How glorious is thy girdle, cast    O'er mountain, tower, and town,  Or mirror'd in the ocean vast    A thousand fathoms down!    As fresh in yon horizon dark,    As young thy beauties seem,  As when the eagle from the ark    First sported in thy beam.    For, faithful to its sacred page,    Heaven still rebuilds thy span;  Nor lets the type grow pale with age    That first spoke peace to man.    T. CAMPBELL.          HERE FOLLOWETH THE LIFE OF ABRAHAM      The Sunday called Quinquagesima is read in the church the history of the  holy patriarch Abraham which was the son of Terah. This Terah was the  tenth from Noah in the generation of Shem. Japhet had seven sons and Ham  four sons. Out of the generation of Ham Nimrod came, which was a wicked  man and cursed in his works, and began to make the tower of Babel which  was great and high. And at the making of this tower, God changed the  languages, in such wise that no man understood other. For tofore the  building of that tower was but one manner speech in all the world, and  there were made seventy-two speeches. The tower was great, it was ten  miles about and five thousand and eighty-four steps of height. This  Nimrod was the first man that found mawmetry and idolatry, which endured  long and yet doth. Then I turn again to Terah which had three sons,  which was Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Of Nahor came Us, Bus, and Batuel. Of  Us came Job, of Bus came Balaam, and of Batuel Rebekah and Laban. Of  Haran came Lot and two daughters, Melcha and Sara.    Now I shall speak of Abram of whom our blessed lady came. He wedded  Sara, daughter of his brother Haran. Abram was ever faithful and true,  he was sixty-five years old when his father died, for whom he mourned  till our Lord comforted him, which said to Abram: Abram, make thee ready  and go out of thy land and kindred, and also from the house of thy  father, and come into the land that I shall show to thee. I shall make  thee grow into much people; I shall bless thee and magnify thy name, and  thou shalt be blessed, and I shall bless them that bless thee, and curse  them that curse thee, and in thee shall be blessed all the kindreds of  the earth.    Abram was seventy years old when he departed from the land of Haran, and  he took with him Sara his wife, and Lot the son of his brother, and  their meiny [company], and his cattle and his substance, and came into  the land of Canaan, and came into the vale of Sichem, in which were ill  people which were the people of Canaan. And our Lord said to Abram: I  shall give to thee this land and to thine heirs. Then Abram did raise an  altar on which he did sacrifice, and blessed and thanked our Lord. Abram  beheld all the land toward the south, and saw the beauty thereof, and  found it like as our Lord told him. But he had not been long in the land  but that there fell great hunger therein, wherefore he left that country  and went into Egypt and took with him Sara his wife. And as they went by  the way Abram said to his wife: I fear and dread sore that when we come  to this people, which be lawless, that they shall take thee for thy  beauty and slay me, because they would use thee. Wherefore say thou art  my sister, and I thy brother, and she agreed thereto. And when they  were come in to that country the people saw that she was so fair, and  anon they told the king, which anon commanded that she should be brought  into his presence. And when she was come, God of his good grace so  purveyed for her, that no man had power to do her villany. Wherefore the  king was feared that God would have taken vengeance on him for her, and  sent for Abram and said to him that he should take his wife, and that he  had evil done to say, that she was his sister, and so delivered her  again, and gave him gold and silver, and bade that men should worship  him in all his land, and he should freely at his pleasure depart with  all his goods. Then after this Abram took his wife Sara and went home  again, and came unto Bethel, and set there an altar of stone, and there  he adored and worshipped the name of God. His store and beasts began to  multiply, and Lot with his meiny was also there. And their beasts began  so sore to increase and multiply, that unnethe [hardly] the country  might suffice to their pasture, in so much that rumor and grudging began  to sourde and arise between the herdmen of Abram and the herdmen of Lot.  Then Abram said to Lot: Lo! this country is great and wide, I pray thee  to choose on which hand thou wilt go, and take it for thy meiny and thy  beasts. And let no strife be between me and thee, ne between my herdmen  ne thy herdmen. Lo! behold all the country is tofore thee, take which  thou wilt; if thou go on the right side, I shall go on the left side,  and if thou take the left, I will go on the right side. Then Lot beheld  the country and saw a fair plain toward flom Jordan, which was pleasant,  and the flood ran toward Sodom and Gomorrah, which was like a paradise,  and took that part for him. And Abram took toward the west, which was  beside the people of Canaan at the foot of mount Mamre. And Lot dwelled  in Sodom. The people of Sodom were worst of all people.    Our Lord said to Abram: Lift up thine eyes and see directly from the  place that thou art now in, from the north to the south, and from the  east to the west. All this land that thou seest I shall give thee, and  to thy seed for evermore. I shall make thy seed as powder or dust of the  earth, who that may number the dust of the earth shall number thy seed.  Arise therefore and walk the land in length and in breadth, for I shall  give it to thee. Abram moved then his tabernacle and dwelled in the  valley of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and set there his tabernacle. It  happened soon after that there was a war in that land, that four kings  warred again other five kings, which were of Sodom, Gomorrah and other.  And the four kings overthrew the five and slew them, and spoiled and  took all the substance of the country and took also with them Lot and  all his goods. And a man gat away from them and came to Abram, and told  him how that Lot was taken and led away. And then anon Abram did do  gather his people together, the number of three hundred and eighteen.  And followed after, and departed his people in two parties because they  should not escape. And Abram smote in among them, and slew the kings,  and rescued Lot and all his goods, and delivered the men of Sodom that  were taken and the women. And they of Sodom came against him, and  Melchisedech came and met with him, and offered to him bread and wine.  This Melchisedech was king and priest of Jerusalem and all the country,  and blessed Abram. And there Abram gave to him the tythes of all he had.  And the king of Sodom would that Abram should have had such prey as he  took, but he would not have as much as the latchet of a shoe, and thus  gat Abram much love of all the people.    After this our Lord appeared to Abram in a vision and said: Abram, dread  thee nothing, I am thy protector, and thy reward and meed shall be  great. Abram answered: Lord God, what wilt thou give me? Thou wottest  well I have no children, and sith I have none I will well that Eleazar  the son of my bailiff be my heir. Nay, said our Lord, he shall not be  thine heir, but he that shall issue and come of thy seed shall be thine  heir. Our Lord led him out and bade him behold the heaven, and number  the stars if thou mayst, and"]]]
