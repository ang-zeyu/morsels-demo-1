They generally remained on the coast and about the adjacent  seas, for two years, carrying on as wandering and adventurous a commerce  on the water as did the traders and trappers on land. Their trade  extended along the whole coast from California to the high northern  latitudes. They would run in near shore, anchor, and wait for the  natives to come off in their canoes with peltries. The trade exhausted  at one place, they would up anchor and off to another. In this way they  would consume the summer, and when autumn came on, would run down to the  Sandwich Islands and winter in some friendly and plentiful harbor. In  the following year they would resume their summer trade, commencing at  California and proceeding north: and, having in the course of the two  seasons collected a sufficient cargo of peltries, would make the best  of their way to China. Here they would sell their furs, take in teas,  nankeens, and other merchandise, and return to Boston, after an absence  of two or three years.    The people, however, who entered most extensively and effectively in the  fur trade of the Pacific, were the Russians. Instead of making casual  voyages, in transient ships, they established regular trading houses in  the high latitudes, along the northwest coast of America, and upon the  chain of the Aleutian Islands between Kamtschatka and the promontory of  Alaska.    To promote and protect these enterprises, a company was incorporated by  the Russian government with exclusive privileges, and a capital of two  hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling; and the sovereignty of that  part of the American continent, along the coast of which the posts had  been established, was claimed by the Russian crown, on the plea that the  land had been discovered and occupied by its subjects.    As China was the grand mart for the furs collected in these quarters,  the Russians had the advantage over their competitors in the trade. The  latter had to take their peltries to Canton, which, however, was a mere  receiving mart, from whence they had to be distributed over the interior  of the empire and sent to the northern parts, where there was the chief  consumption. The Russians, on the contrary, carried their furs, by a  shorter voyage, directly to the northern parts of the Chinese empire;  thus being able to afford them in the market without the additional cost  of internal transportation.    We come now to the immediate field of operation of the great enterprise  we have undertaken to illustrate.    Among the American ships which traded along the northwest coast in 1792,  was the Columbia, Captain Gray, of Boston. In the course of her voyage  she discovered the mouth of a large river in lat. 46 19' north. Entering  it with some difficulty, on account of sand-bars and breakers, she came  to anchor in a spacious bay. A boat was well manned, and sent on shore  to a village on the beach, but all the inhabitants fled excepting the  aged and infirm. The kind manner in which these were treated, and the  presents given them, gradually lured back the others, and a friendly  intercourse took place. They had never seen a ship or a white man. When  they had first descried the Columbia, they had supposed it a floating  island; then some monster of the deep; but when they saw the boat  putting for shore with human beings on board, they considered them  cannibals sent by the Great Spirit to ravage the country and devour the  inhabitants. Captain Gray did not ascend the river farther than the bay  in question, which continues to bear his name. After putting to sea, he  fell in with the celebrated discoverer, Vancouver, and informed him  of his discovery, furnished him with a chart which he had made of the  river. Vancouver visited the river, and his lieutenant, Broughton,  explored it by the aid of Captain Gray's chart; ascending it upwards of  one hundred miles, until within view of a snowy mountain, to which he  gave the name of Mt. Hood, which it still retains.    The existence of this river, however, was known long before the visits  of Gray and Vancouver, but the information concerning it was vague and  indefinite, being gathered from the reports of Indians. It was spoken  of by travellers as the Oregon, and as the Great River of the West. A  Spanish ship is said to have been wrecked at the mouth, several of the  crew of which lived for some time among the natives. The Columbia,  however, is believed to be the first ship that made a regular discovery  and anchored within its waters, and it has since generally borne the  name of that vessel. As early as 1763, shortly after the acquisition of  the Canadas by Great Britain, Captain Jonathan Carver, who had been in  the British provincial army, projected a journey across the continent  between the forty-third and forty-sixth degrees of northern latitude  to the shores of the Pacific Ocean. His objects were to ascertain the  breadth of the continent at its broadest part, and to determine on some  place on the shores of the Pacific, where government might establish  a post to facilitate the discovery of a northwest passage, or a  communication between Hudson's Bay and the Pacific Ocean. This place he  presumed would be somewhere about the Straits of Annian, at which point  he supposed the Oregon disembogued itself. It was his opinion, also,  that a settlement on this extremity of America would disclose new  sources of trade, promote many useful discoveries, and open a more  direct communication with China and the English settlements in the East  Indies, than that by the Cape of Good Hope or the Straits of Magellan. *  This enterprising and intrepid traveller was twice baffled in individual  efforts to accomplish this great journey. In 1774, he was joined in  the scheme by Richard Whitworth, a member of Parliament, and a man of  wealth. Their enterprise was projected on a broad and bold plan. They  were to take with them fifty or sixty men, artificers and mariners.  With these they were to make their way up one of the branches of the  Missouri, explore the mountains for the source of the Oregon, or River  of the West, and sail down that river to its supposed exit, near the  Straits of Annian. Here they were to erect a fort, and build the vessels  necessary to carry their discoveries by sea into effect. Their plan had  the sanction of the British government, and grants and other requisites  were nearly completed, when the breaking out of the American Revolution  once more defeated the undertaking. **    The expedition of Sir Alexander Mackenzie in 1793, across the continent  to the Pacific Ocean, which he reached in lat. 52 20' 48\", again  suggested the possibility of linking together the trade of both sides of  the continent. In lat. 52 30' he had descended a river for some distance  which flowed towards the south, and wag called by the natives Tacoutche  Tesse, and which he erroneously supposed to be the Columbia. It was  afterwards ascertained that it emptied itself in lat. 49 degrees,  whereas the mouth of the Columbia is about three degrees further south.    When Mackenzie some years subsequently published an account of his  expeditions, he suggested the policy of opening an intercourse between  the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and forming regular establishments  through the interior and at both extremes, as well as along the coasts  and islands. By this means, he observed, the entire command of the fur  trade of North America might be obtained from lat. 48 north to the pole,  excepting that portion held by the Russians, for as to the American  adventurers who had hitherto enjoyed the traffic along the northwest  coast, they would instantly disappear, he added, before a well regulated  trade.    A scheme of this kind, however, was too vast and hazardous for  individual enterprise; it could only be undertaken by a company under  the sanction and protection of a government; and as there might be a  clashing of claims between the Hudson's Bay and Northwest Company, the  one holding by right of charter, the other by right of possession,  he proposed that the two comparties should coalesce in this great  undertaking. The long-cherished jealousies of these two companies,  however, were too deep and strong to allow them to listen to such  counsel.    In the meantime the attention of the American government was attracted  to the subject, and the memorable expedition under Messrs. Lewis and  Clarke fitted out. These gentlemen, in 1804, accomplished the enterprise  which had been projected by Carver and Whitworth in 1774. They  ascended the Missouri, passed through the stupendous gates of the Rocky  Mountains, hitherto unknown to white men; discovered and explored the  upper waters of the Columbia, and followed that river down to its  mouth, where their countryman, Gray, had anchored about twelve years  previously. Here they passed the winter, and returned across the  mountains in the following spring. The reports published by them of  their expedition demonstrated the practicability of establishing a line  of communication across the continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific  Ocean.    It was then that the idea presented itself to the mind of Mr. Astor, of  grasping with his individual hand this great enterprise, which for years  had been dubiously yet desirously contemplated by powerful associations  and maternal governments. For some time he revolved the idea in his  mind, gradually extending and maturing his plans as his means of  executing them augmented. The main feature of his scheme was to  establish a line of trading posts along the Missouri and the Columbia,  to the mouth of the latter, where was to be founded the chief trading  house or mart. Inferior posts would be established in the interior, and  on all the tributary streams of the Columbia, to trade with the Indians;  these posts would draw their supplies from the main establishment, and  bring to it the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13711"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#5)"],[1,"of the second Melbourne Administration in 1841. It  was in April, 1835, that Lord Melbourne was restored to power, but  the continued enjoyment of office did not much promote the political  interests of his party, and from various causes the power of the  whigs began to decline. The commencement of a new reign gave them some  popularity, but in the new House of Commons, elected in consequence  of that event, the conservative party were evidently gaining strength;  still, after the failure of 1834-5, it was no easy task to dislodge an  existing ministry, and at the same time to be prepared with a cabinet  and a party competent to succeed them. Sir Robert Peel, therefore,  with characteristic caution, \"bided his time\", conducting the business  of opposition throughout the whole of this period with an ability and  success of which history affords few examples. He had accepted the  Reform Bill as the established law of England, and as the system upon  which the country was thenceforward to be governed. He was willing  to carry it out in its true spirit, but he would proceed no further.  He marshaled his opposition upon the principle of resistance to any  further organic changes, and he enlisted the majority of the peers  and nearly the whole of the country gentlemen of England in support  of the great principle of protection to British industry. The little  maneuvres and small political intrigues of the period are almost  forgotten, and the remembrance of them is scarcely worthy of revival.  It may, however, be mentioned, that in 1839 ministers, being left in  a minority, resigned, and Sir Robert Peel, when sent for by the Queen,  demanded that certain ladies in the household of her majesty,--the  near relatives of eminent whig politicians,--should be removed  from the personal service of the sovereign. As this was refused,  he abandoned for the time any attempt to form a government, and his  opponents remained in office till September, 1841. It was then Sir  Robert Peel became the first lord of the treasury, and the Duke of  Wellington, without office, accepted a seat in the cabinet, taking  the management of the House of Lords. His ministry was formed on  protectionist principles, but the close of its career was marked by  the adoption of free trade doctrines differing in the widest and most  liberal sense. Sir Robert Peel's sense of public duty impelled him  once more to incur the odium and obliquy which attended a fundamental  change of policy, and a repudiation of the political partizans  by whose ardent support a minister may have attained office and  authority. It was his fate to encounter more than any man ever did,  that hostility which such conduct, however necessary, never fails  to produce. This great change in our commercial policy, however  unavoidable, must be regarded as the proximate cause of his final  expulsion from office in July, 1846. His administration, however, had  been signalized by several measures of great political importance.  Among the earliest and most prominent of these were his financial  plans, the striking feature of which was an income-tax; greatly  extolled for the exemption it afforded from other burdens pressing  more severely on industry, but loudly condemned for its irregular and  unequal operation, a vice which has since rendered its contemplated  increase impossible.    Of the ministerial life of Sir Robert Peel little more remains to be  related except that which properly belongs rather to the history of  the country than to his individual biography. But it would be unjust  to the memory of one of the most sagacious statesman that England ever  produced to deny that his latest renunciation of political principles  required but two short years to attest the vital necessity of that  unqualified surrender. If the corn laws had been in existence at the  period when the political system of the continent was shaken to its  centre and dynasties crumbled into dust, a question would have been  left in the hands of the democratic party of England, the force of  which neither skill nor influence could then have evaded. Instead  of broken friendships, shattered reputations for consistency, or  diminished rents, the whole realm of England might have borne a  fearful share in that storm of wreck and revolution which had its  crisis in the 10th of April, 1848.    In the course of his long and eventful life many honors were conferred  upon Sir Robert Peel. Wherever he went, and almost at all times,  he attracted universal attention, and was always received with the  highest consideration. At the close of 1836 the University of Glasgow  elected him Lord Rector, and the conservatives of that city, in  January, 1837, invited him to a banquet at which three thousand  gentlemen assembled to do honor to their great political chief. But  this was only one among many occasions on which he was \"the great  guest.\" Perhaps the most remarkable of these banquets was that given  to him in 1835 at Merchant Tailors' Hall by three hundred members of  the House of Commons. Many other circumstances might be related to  illustrate the high position which Sir Robert Peel occupied. Anecdotes  innumerable might be recorded to show the extraordinary influence in  Parliament which made him \"the great commoner\" of the age; for Sir  Robert Peel was not only a skillful and adroit debater, but by many  degrees the most able and one of the most eloquent men in either house  of parliament. Nothing could be more stately or imposing than the  long array of sounding periods in which he expounded his doctrines,  assailed his political adversaries, or vindicated his own policy. But  when the whole land laments his loss, when England mourns the untimely  fate of one of her noblest sons, the task of critical disquisition  upon literary attainments or public oratory possesses little  attraction. It may be left for calmer moments, and a more distant  time, to investigate with unforgiving justice the sources of his  errors, or to estimate the precise value of services which the  public is now disposed to regard with no other feelings than those of  unmingled gratitude.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration]    FROM THE ART-JOURNAL.    MEMORIES OF MISS JANE PORTER.    BY MRS. S.C. HALL.    The frequent observation of foreigners is, that in England we have  few \"celebrated women.\" Perhaps they mean that we have few who are  \"notorious;\" but let us admit that in either case they are right; and  may we not express our belief in its being better for women and for  the community that such is the case. \"Celebrity\" rarely adds to the  happiness of a woman, and almost as rarely increases her usefulness.  The time and attention required to attain \"celebrity,\" must, except  under very peculiar circumstances, interfere with the faithful  discharge of those feminine duties upon which the well-doing of  society depends, and which shed so pure a halo around our English  homes. Within these \"homes\" our heroes, statesmen, philosophers, men  of letters, men of genius, receive their first impressions, and the  _impetus_ to a faithful discharge of their after callings as Christian  subjects of the State.    There are few of such men who do not trace back their resolution,  their patriotism, their wisdom, their learning--the nourishment of  all their higher aspirations--to a wise, hopeful, loving-hearted  and faith-inspired Mother; one who believed in a son's destiny to be  great; it may be, impelled to such belief rather by instinct than by  reason: who cherished (we can find no better word) the \"Hero-feeling\"  of devotion to what was right; though it might have been unworldly;  and whose deep heart welled up perpetual love and patience toward the  overboiling faults and frequent stumblings of a hot youth, which she  felt would mellow into a fruitful manhood.    The strength and glory of England are in the keeping of the wives  and mothers of its men; and when we are questioned touching our  \"celebrated women\", we may in general terms refer to those who have  watched over, moulded, and inspired our \"celebrated men\".    Happy is the country where the laws of God and Nature are held in  reverence--where each sex fulfills its peculiar duties, and renders  its sphere a sanctuary! And surely such harmony is blessed by the  Almighty--for while other nations writhe in anarchy and poverty, our  own spreads wide her arms to receive all who seek protection or need  repose.    But if we have few \"celebrated\" women, few who, impelled either by  circumstances or the irrepressible restlessness of genius, go forth  amid the pitfalls of publicity, and battle with the world, either as  poets, or dramatists, or moralists, or mere tale-tellers in simple  prose--or, more dangerous still, \"hold the mirror up to nature\" on  the stage that mimics life--if we have but few, we have, and have  had _some_, of whom we are justly proud; women of such well-balanced  minds, that toil they ever so laboriously in their public and perilous  paths, their domestic and social duties have been fulfilled with as  diligent and faithful love as though the world had never been purified  and enriched by the treasures of their feminine wisdom; yet this  does not shake our belief, that despite the spotless and well-earned  reputations they enjoyed, the homage they received, (and it has its  charm,) and even the blessed consciousness of having contributed to  the healthful recreation, the improved morality, the diffusion of the  best sort of knowledge--the _woman_ would have been happier had she  continued enshrined in the privacy of domestic love and domestic duty.  She may not think this at the commencement of her career; and at its  termination, if she has lived sufficiently long to have descended,  even gracefully, from her pedestal, she may often recall the homage of  the _past_ to make up for its lack in the _present_.
