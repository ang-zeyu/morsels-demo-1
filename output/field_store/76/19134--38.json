Unhappily we were in the season of the high tides, which was the most  unfavorable time for us because they were going to decline, and we ran a  ground just when the water was at the highest; for the rest, the tides do  not much differ in these seas; at the time of full moon they do not rise  more than fifty centimetres more than usual; in the spring tides the water  does not rise above one hundred and twenty centimetres on the reef. We have  already said that when we grounded, the sounding line marked only five  metres, and sixty centimetres; and at low water it marked, four metres  sixty centimetres, the frigate therefore saved by a metre: however, as soon  as we had stranded, the boats which went out to sound, met with places  deeper than that, where we struck, and many others not so deep; which made  us suppose that the reef is very uneven and covered with little elevations.  All the different manoeuvres which had been performed since the moment when  we found ourselves in eighteen fathoms, to that in which we struck,  succeeded each other with extraordinary rapidity: not above ten minutes  passed. Several persons have assured us that, if the ship had come entirely  to the wind, when we were in eighteen fathoms, the frigate might perhaps  have got clean, for she did not run wholly aground till she got to the west  part of the reef, and upon its edge.    We stranded on the 2d of July, at a quarter after three p.m. in 19 deg. 36'  north latitude, and 19 deg. 45' west longitude. This event spread the most  profound consternation; if in the midst of this disorder, there were any  men who remained collected enough to make observations, they must have been  struck with the extraordinary changes impressed on every countenance; some  persons were not to be recognised. Here you might see features become  shrunk and hideous; there a countenance which had assumed a yellow and even  a greenish hue, some men seemed thunderstruck and chained down to their  places, without strength to move. When they had recovered from the  stupefaction, with which they were at first seized, numbers gave themselves  up to excess of despair; while others uttered imprecations upon those whose  ignorance had been so fatal to us. An officer going upon deck, immediately  after the accident, spoke with energy to him, who, as we have already said,  had directed for some days the course of the ship, and said to him, \"_See,  Sir, to what your obstinacy has brought us; I had warned you of it_.\" Two  women alone seemed insensible to this disaster; they were the wife and  daughter of the governor. What a shocking contrast! men who for twenty or  twenty-five years, had been exposed to a thousand dangers, were, profoundly  affected, while Madame and Mademoiselle Chemals, appeared insensible, and  as if unconcerned in these events.    As soon as the frigate stranded, the sails were hastily lowered, the top  gallant masts got down, the top masts lowered, and every thing necessary  arranged to get her off the reef. After numerous efforts, night being come,  they were suspended to give some repose to the crew, who had displayed  extreme activity. The next day, the third, the top masts were got down, the  yards lowered, and they heaved at the capstern upon an anchor which had  been fixed the evening before, at a cable's length a-stern of the frigate.  This operation was fruitless; for the anchor, which was too weak, could not  make sufficient resistance and gave way: a bower anchor was then used,  which, after infinite pains, was carried out to a considerable distance, to  a place where there was only a depth of five metres sixty centimetres; in  order to carry it so far, it was fixed behind a boat, under which was  placed a number of empty barrels fastened together because the boat was not  able to carry so considerable a weight.[15] The sea ran very high, and the  current was extremely strong.    This boat, when it reached the spot where it was to cast the anchor, could  not place it in the proper position to make the flukes fix in the sand, for  one of the extremities already touched the bottom, while the other was  still put of the water: being thus ill fixed, it could not answer the  purpose intended; when they began to heave upon it, it made very little  resistance, and would have been dragged on board again if they had  continued to work at the capstern.[16] In the course of the day, we staved  several water butts which were in the hold, and pumped immediately, the top  masts, except the small one which could not be got down, were thrown into  the sea; the yards, the boom, and all the pieces of wood which afterwards  composed.    If the loss of the vessel was certain, it was proper to secure the escape  of the crew: a council was called, at which the governor of Senegal gave  the plan of a raft, capable, it was said, of carrying two hundred men, with  provisions.[17] It was necessary to have recourse to an expedient of this  nature, because our six boats were judged to be incapable of taking on  board four hundred men, which was our number. The provisions were to be  deposited on the raft, and at the hours of meals, the crews of the boats  would have come to receive their rations: we were to reach all together the  sandy coast of the desert, and there furnished with arms and ammunition,  which were to be taken in by the boats before we left the frigate, we were  to form a caravan, and proceed to the Island of St. Louis. The events which  happened in the sequel, proved that this plan was perfectly well laid, and  that it might have been crowned with success: unhappily these decisions  were traced upon a loose sand, which was dispersed by the breath of  egotism.    In the evening another anchor was cast, at a pretty considerable distance  from the frigate: just before high water, we began to work at the capstern,  but in vain. The work was put off till the next morning's tide; during all  this time, the operations were performed with the greatest difficulty; the  sea was hollow, the winds strong, the boats which had to go to a distance  either to sound or fix: anchors, could not attain their object, without the  greatest efforts; rapid currents, added to the difficulties. If the weather  had not been so extremely unfavorable to us, perhaps the frigate might have  been got afloat the next day, for it had been resolved to carry out very  long warps, but the violence of the wind, and the sea, baffled these  arrangements which nothing but a calm could favor. The weather was bad  during the whole night; about four or five o'clock, at the morning tide,  all our efforts to raise her were still fruitless; we began to despair of  even being able to save her from this danger; the boats were repaired, and  the construction of the raft diligently prosecuted: during the day of the  4. several barrels of flour were thrown into the sea, some water casks  staved; some barrels of powder, intended as articles to trade with Segenal,  were also got overboard.    In the evening, a few minutes before high water, the labours at the  capstern recommenced; this time the anchors did not deceive our  expectations; for, after a few moments labour, the frigate moved on the  larboard; this motion was effected by means of an anchor fixed on the north  west; the stream cable which was bent to its ring, came by the head of the  ship and tended to make it swing; while another much stronger one, the  cable of which passed through one of the stern ports, tended to prevent it  from running a-head, by supporting its quarters the motions of which were  commanded by means of this force. This first success gave us great hopes;  we worked with ardor.    After some further efforts, the _Medusa_ began to swing sensibly; we  redoubled our efforts, she swung intirely and then had her head turned, to  the open sea. She was almost afloat, only her stern touched a little; the  work could not be continued, because the anchor was too near, and it would  have been hove up. If a warp had been carried out in the open sea, by  continuing to haul upon it, the frigate would have been got wholly afloat  that evening. All the things which had been thrown overboard had lightened  her, by twenty or thirty centimetres at the most, her draught of water  might certainly have been lessened still more; but it was not done because  the Governor of Senegal objected to throwing the barrels of flour into the  sea, alledging that the greatest scarcity prevailed in the European  factories. These considerations, however, should not have caused it to be  overlooked that we had on board fourteen twenty-four pounders, and that it  would have been easy to throw them overboard, and send them even to a  considerable distance from the frigate, by means of the yard tackle;  besides, the flour barrels might have been carefully fastened together, and  when we were once out of danger, it would have been easy for us to remove  them. This plan might have been executed without any fear of doing much  damage to the flour, which when it is plunged in the water forms round the  inside of the barrel a pretty thick crust, in consequence of the moisture,  so that the interior is preserved from injury: this method was indeed  attempted,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#5)"],[1,"into the traffic,  dodging this way and that, and making after Monte Irvin's car. Of the  fact that his friend was close beside him he remained unaware until, on  the corner of old Bond Street, a firm grip settled upon his shoulder.  Gray turned angrily. But the grip was immovable, and he found himself  staring into the unemotional face of Seton Pasha.    \"Seton, for God's sake, don't detain me! I must learn what's wrong.\"    \"Pull up, Gray.\"    Quentin Gray clenched his teeth.    \"Listen to me, Seton. This is no time for interference. I--\"    \"You are about to become involved in some very unsavory business; and I  repeat--pull up. In a moment we shall learn all there is to be learned.  But are you determined openly to thrust yourself into the family affairs  of Mr. Monte Irvin?\"    \"If anything has happened to Rita I'll kill that damned cur Pyne!\"    \"You are determined to intrude upon this man in your present frame of  mind at a time of evident trouble?\"    But Gray was deaf to the promptings of prudence and good taste alike.    \"I'm going to see the thing through,\" he said hoarsely.    \"Quite so. Rely upon me. But endeavor to behave more like a man of  the world and less like a dangerous lunatic, or we shall quarrel  atrociously.\"    Quentin Gray audibly gnashed his teeth, but the cool stare of the  other's eyes was quelling, and now as their glances met and clashed, a  sympathetic smile softened the lines of Seton's grim mouth, and:    \"I quite understand, old chap,\" he said, linking his arm in Gray's. \"But  can't you see how important it is, for everybody's sake, that we should  tackle the thing coolly?\"    \"Seton\"--Gray's voice broke--\"I'm sorry. I know I'm mad; but I was with  her only an hour ago, and now--\"    \"And now 'her' husband appears on the scene accompanied by a police  inspector and a sergeant. What are your relations with Mr. Monte Irvin?\"    They were walking rapidly again along Bond Street.    \"What do you mean, Seton?\" asked Gray.    \"I mean does he approve of your friendship with his wife, or is it a  clandestine affair?\"    \"Clandestine?--certainly not. I was on my way to call at the house when  I met her with Pyne this evening.\"    \"That is what I wanted to know. Very well; since you intend to follow  the thing up, it simplifies matters somewhat. Here is the car.\"    \"At Kazmah's door! What in heaven's name does it mean?\"    \"It means that we shall get a very poor reception if we intrude.  Question the chauffeur.\"    But Gray had already approached the man, who touched his cap in  recognition.    \"What's the trouble, Pattison?\" he demanded breathlessly. \"I saw police  in the car a moment ago.\"    \"Yes, sir. I don't rightly know, sir, what's happened. But Mr. Irvin  drove from home to the corner of old Bond Street a quarter of an hour  ago and told me to wait, then came back again and drove round to Vine  Street to fetch the police. They're inside now.\"    Even as he spoke, with excitement ill-concealed, a police-sergeant came  out of the doorway, and:    \"Move on, there,\" he said to Seton and Gray. \"You mustn't hang about  this door.\"    \"Excuse me, Sergeant,\" cried Gray, \"but if the matter concerns Mrs.  Monte Irvin I can probably supply information.\"    The Sergeant stared at him hard, saw that both he and his friend wore  evening dress, and grew proportionately respectful.    \"What is your name, sir?\" he asked. \"I'll mention it to the officer in  charge.\"    \"Quentin Gray. Inform Mr. Monte Irvin that I wish to speak to him.\"    \"Very good, sir.\" He turned to the chauffeur. \"Hand me out the bag I  gave you at Vine Street.\" Pattison leaned over the door at the front  of the car, and brought out a big leather grip. With this in hand the  police-sergeant returned into the doorway.    \"We're in for it now,\" said Seton grimly, \"whatever it is.\"    Gray returned no answer, moving restlessly up and down before the door  in a fever of excitement and dread. Presently the Sergeant reappeared.    \"Step this way, please,\" he said.    Followed by Seton and Gray he led the way up to the landing before  Kazmah's apartments. It was vaguely lighted by two police-lanterns. Four  men were standing there, and four pairs of eyes were focussed upon the  stair-head.    Monte Irvin, his features a distressing ashen color, spoke.    \"That you, Gray?\" Quentin Gray would not have recognized the voice.  \"Thanks for offering your help. God knows I need all I can get. You were  with Rita tonight. What happened? Where is she?\"    \"Heaven knows where she is!\" cried Gray. \"I left her here with Pyne  shortly after seven o'clock.\"    He paused, fixing his gaze upon the face of Brisley, whose shifty eyes  avoided him and who was licking his lips in the manner of a dog who has  seen the whip.    \"Why,\" said Gray, \"I believe you are the fellow who has been following  me all night for some reason.\"    He stepped toward the foxy little man but:    \"Never mind, Gray,\" interrupted Irvin. \"I was to blame. But he was  following my wife, not you. Tell me quickly: Why did she come here?\"    Gray raised his hand to his brow with a gesture of bewilderment.    \"To consult this man, Kazmah. I actually saw her enter the inner room, I  went to get a cab, and when I returned the door was locked.\"    \"You knocked?\"    \"Of course. I made no end of a row. But I could get no reply and went  away.\"    Monte Irvin turned, a pathetic figure, to the Inspector who stood beside  him.    \"We may as well proceed, Inspector Whiteleaf,\" he said. \"Mr. Gray's  evidence throws no light on the matter at all.\"    \"Very well, sir,\" was the reply; \"we have the warrant, and have given  the usual notice to whoever may be hiding inside. Burton!\"    The Sergeant stepped forward, placed the leather bag on the floor,  and stooping, opened it, revealing a number of burglarious-looking  instruments.    \"Shall I try to cut through the panel?\" he asked.    \"No, no!\" cried Monte Irvin. \"Waste no time. You have a crowbar there.  Force the door from its hinges. Hurry, man!\"    \"It doesn't work on hinges!\" Gray interrupted excitedly. \"It slides to  the right by means of some arrangement concealed under the mat.\"    \"Pass that lantern,\" directed Burton, glancing over his shoulder to  Gunn.    Setting it beside him, the Sergeant knelt and examined the threshold of  the door.    \"A metal plate,\" he said. \"The weight moves a lever, I suppose, which  opens the door if it isn't locked. The lock will be on the left of the  door as it opens to the right. Let's see what we can do.\"    He stood up, crowbar in hand, and inserted the chisel blade of the  implement between the edge of the door and the doorcase.    \"Hold steady!\" said the Inspector, standing at his elbow.    The dull metallic sound of hammer blows on steel echoed queerly around  the well of the staircase. Brisley and Gunn, standing very close  together on the bottom step of the stair to the third floor, watched the  police furtively. Irvin and Gray found a common fascination in the door  itself, and Seton, cheroot in mouth, looked from group to group with  quiet interest.    \"Right!\" cried the Sergeant.    The blows ceased.    Firmly grasping the bar, Burton brought all his weight to bear upon it.  There was a dull, cracking sound and a sort of rasping. The door moved  slightly.    \"There's where it locks!\" said the Inspector, directing the light of  a lantern upon the crevice created. \"Three inches lower. But it may be  bolted as well.\"    \"We'll soon get at the bolts,\" replied Burton, the lust of destruction  now strong upon him.    Wrenching the crowbar from its place he attacked the lower panel of the  door, and amid a loud splintering and crashing created a hole big enough  to allow of the passage of a hand and arm.    The Inspector reached in, groped about, and then uttered an exclamation  of triumph.    \"I've unfastened the bolt,\" he said. \"If there isn't another at the top  you ought to be able to force the door now, Burton.\"    The jimmy was thrust back into position, and:    \"Stand clear!\" cried Burton.    Again he threw his weight upon the bar--and again.    \"Drive it further in!\" said Monte Irvin; and snatching up the heavy  hammer, he rained blows upon the steel butt. \"Now try.\"    Burton exerted himself to the utmost.    \"Take hold up here, someone!\" he panted. \"Two of us can pull.\"    Gray leapt forward, and the pair of them bent to the task.    There came a dull report of parting mechanism, more sounds of  splintering wood... and the door rolled open!    A moment of tense silence, then:    \"Is anyone inside there?\" cried the Inspector loudly.    Not a sound came from the dark interior.    \"The lantern!\" whispered Monte Irvin.    He stumbled into the room, from which a heavy smell of perfume swept out  upon the landing. Quentin Gray, snatching the lantern from the floor,  where it had been replaced, was the next to enter.    \"Look for the switch, and turn the lights on!\" called the Inspector,  following.    Even as he spoke, Gray had found the switch, and the apartment of Kazmah  became flooded with subdued light.    A glance showed it to be unoccupied.    Gray ran across to the mushrabiyeh cabinet and jerked the curtains  aside. There was no one in the cabinet. It contained a chair and a  table. Upon the latter was a telephone and some papers and books. \"This  way!\" he cried, his voice high pitched and unnatural.    He burst through the doorway into the inner room which he had seen Mrs.  Irvin enter. The air was laden with the smell of frankincense.    \"A lantern!\" he called. \"I left one on the divan.\"    But Monte Irvin had caught it up and was already at his elbow. His hand  was shaking so that the light danced wildly now upon the carpet, now  upon the green walls. This room also was deserted. A black gap in the  curtain showed where the material had been roughly torn. Suddenly:    \"My God, look!\" muttered the Inspector, who, with the others, now stood  in the curious draped apartment.    A"]]]
