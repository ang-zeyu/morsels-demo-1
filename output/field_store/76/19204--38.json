As it was, he felt compelled to retire  up the canyon until he could recover his gravity. There he confided the  joke to the tall pine trees, with many slaps of his leg, contortions of  his face, and the usual profanity. But when he returned to the party, he  found them seated by a fire--for the air had grown strangely chill  and the sky overcast--in apparently amicable conversation. Piney was  actually talking in an impulsive, girlish fashion to the Duchess, who  was listening with an interest and animation she had not shown for many  days. The Innocent was holding forth, apparently with equal effect,  to Mr. Oakhurst and Mother Shipton, who was actually relaxing into  amiability. \"Is this yer a damned picnic?\" said Uncle Billy with inward  scorn as he surveyed the sylvan group, the glancing firelight, and the  tethered animals in the foreground. Suddenly an idea mingled with the  alcoholic fumes that disturbed his brain. It was apparently of a jocular  nature, for he felt impelled to slap his leg again and cram his fist  into his mouth.    As the shadows crept slowly up the mountain, a slight breeze rocked the  tops of the pine trees, and moaned through their long and gloomy aisles.  The ruined cabin, patched and covered with pine boughs, was set apart  for the ladies. As the lovers parted, they unaffectedly exchanged a  kiss, so honest and sincere that it might have been heard above the  swaying pines. The frail Duchess and the malevolent Mother Shipton were  probably too stunned to remark upon this last evidence of simplicity,  and so turned without a word to the hut. The fire was replenished, the  men lay down before the door, and in a few minutes were asleep.    Mr. Oakhurst was a light sleeper. Toward morning he awoke benumbed and  cold. As he stirred the dying fire, the wind, which was now blowing  strongly, brought to his cheek that which caused the blood to leave  it--snow!    He started to his feet with the intention of awakening the sleepers,  for there was no time to lose. But turning to where Uncle Billy had been  lying, he found him gone. A suspicion leaped to his brain and a curse  to his lips. He ran to the spot where the mules had been tethered; they  were no longer there. The tracks were already rapidly disappearing in  the snow.    The momentary excitement brought Mr. Oakhurst back to the fire with  his usual calm. He did not waken the sleepers. The Innocent slumbered  peacefully, with a smile on his good-humored, freckled face; the virgin  Piney slept beside her frailer sisters as sweetly as though attended  by celestial guardians; and Mr. Oakhurst, drawing his blanket over his  shoulders, stroked his mustaches and waited for the dawn. It came slowly  in a whirling mist of snowflakes that dazzled and confused the eye. What  could be seen of the landscape appeared magically changed. He  looked over the valley, and summed up the present and future in two  words--\"snowed in!\"    A careful inventory of the provisions, which, fortunately for the party,  had been stored within the hut and so escaped the felonious fingers of  Uncle Billy, disclosed the fact that with care and prudence they might  last ten days longer. \"That is,\" said Mr. Oakhurst, sotto voce to the  Innocent, \"if you're willing to board us. If you ain't--and perhaps  you'd better not--you can wait till Uncle Billy gets back with  provisions.\" For some occult reason, Mr. Oakhurst could not bring  himself to disclose Uncle Billy's rascality, and so offered the  hypothesis that he had wandered from the camp and had accidentally  stampeded the animals. He dropped a warning to the Duchess and Mother  Shipton, who of course knew the facts of their associate's defection.  \"They'll find out the truth about us all when they find out anything,\"  he added, significantly, \"and there's no good frightening them now.\"    Tom Simson not only put all his worldly store at the disposal of Mr.  Oakhurst, but seemed to enjoy the prospect of their enforced seclusion.  \"We'll have a good camp for a week, and then the snow'll melt, and we'll  all go back together.\" The cheerful gaiety of the young man, and Mr.  Oakhurst's calm, infected the others. The Innocent with the aid of pine  boughs extemporized a thatch for the roofless cabin, and the Duchess  directed Piney in the rearrangement of the interior with a taste and  tact that opened the blue eyes of that provincial maiden to their  fullest extent. \"I reckon now you're used to fine things at Poker Flat,\"  said Piney. The Duchess turned away sharply to conceal something that  reddened her cheeks through its professional tint, and Mother Shipton  requested Piney not to \"chatter.\" But when Mr. Oakhurst returned from a  weary search for the trail, he heard the sound of happy laughter  echoed from the rocks. He stopped in some alarm, and his thoughts first  naturally reverted to the whisky, which he had prudently cached. \"And  yet it don't somehow sound like whisky,\" said the gambler. It was not  until he caught sight of the blazing fire through the still-blinding  storm and the group around it that he settled to the conviction that it  was \"square fun.\"    Whether Mr. Oakhurst had cached his cards with the whisky as something  debarred the free access of the community, I cannot say. It was certain  that, in Mother Shipton's words, he \"didn't say cards once\" during that  evening. Haply the time was beguiled by an accordion, produced somewhat  ostentatiously by Tom Simson from his pack. Notwithstanding some  difficulties attending the manipulation of this instrument, Piney  Woods managed to pluck several reluctant melodies from its keys, to  an accompaniment by the Innocent on a pair of bone castanets. But the  crowning festivity of the evening was reached in a rude camp-meeting  hymn, which the lovers, joining hands, sang with great earnestness and  vociferation. I fear that a certain defiant tone and Covenanter's swing  to its chorus, rather than any devotional quality, caused it speedily to  infect the others, who at last joined in the refrain:    \"I'm proud to live in the service of the Lord,    And I'm bound to die in His army.\"    The pines rocked, the storm eddied and whirled above the miserable  group, and the flames of their altar leaped heavenward as if in token of  the vow.    At midnight the storm abated, the rolling clouds parted, and the  stars glittered keenly above the sleeping camp. Mr. Oakhurst, whose  professional habits had enabled him to live on the smallest possible  amount of sleep, in dividing the watch with Tom Simson somehow managed  to take upon himself the greater part of that duty. He excused himself  to the Innocent by saying that he had \"often been a week without sleep.\"  \"Doing what?\" asked Tom. \"Poker!\" replied Oakhurst, sententiously; \"when  a man gets a streak of luck,--nigger luck--he don't get tired. The luck  gives in first. Luck,\" continued the gambler, reflectively, \"is a mighty  queer thing. All you know about it for certain is that it's bound to  change. And it's finding out when it's going to change that makes you.  We've had a streak of bad luck since we left Poker Flat--you come along,  and slap you get into it, too. If you can hold your cards right along  you're all right. For,\" added the gambler, with cheerful irrelevance,    \"'I'm proud to live in the service of the Lord,    And I'm bound to die in His army.'\"    The third day came, and the sun, looking through the white-curtained  valley, saw the outcasts divide their slowly decreasing store of  provisions for the morning meal. It was one of the peculiarities of that  mountain climate that its rays diffused a kindly warmth over the wintry  landscape, as if in regretful commiseration of the past. But it revealed  drift on drift of snow piled high around the hut--a hopeless, uncharted,  trackless sea of white lying below the rocky shores to which the  castaways still clung. Through the marvelously clear air the smoke of  the pastoral village of Poker Flat rose miles away. Mother Shipton saw  it, and from a remote pinnacle of her rocky fastness hurled in that  direction a final malediction. It was her last vituperative attempt, and  perhaps for that reason was invested with a certain degree of sublimity.  It did her good, she privately informed the Duchess. \"Just you go out  there and cuss, and see.\" She then set herself to the task of amusing  \"the child,\" as she and the Duchess were pleased to call Piney. Piney  was no chicken, but it was a soothing and original theory of the pair  thus to account for the fact that she didn't swear and wasn't improper.    When night crept up again through the gorges, the reedy notes of the  accordion rose and fell in fitful spasms and long-drawn gasps by the  flickering campfire. But music failed to fill entirely the aching  void left by insufficient food, and a new diversion was proposed by  Piney--storytelling. Neither Mr. Oakhurst nor his female companions  caring to relate their personal experiences, this plan would have failed  too but for the Innocent. Some months before he had chanced upon a stray  copy of Mr. Pope's ingenious translation of the ILIAD. He now proposed  to narrate the principal incidents of that poem--having thoroughly  mastered the argument and fairly forgotten the words--in the current  vernacular of Sandy Bar. And so for the rest of that night the Homeric  demigods again walked the earth. Trojan bully and wily Greek wrestled in  the winds, and the great pines in the canyon seemed to bow to the wrath  of the son of Peleus. Mr. Oakhurst listened with quiet satisfaction.  Most especially was he interested in the fate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13121"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 2 (#5)"],[1,"much accustomed to  make free with the land, had kept it barely within sight, and had been  much retarded.    In order to give the botanists an opportunity of examining the  productions of Sandy Cape, I determined to remain here a day; and some  natives being seen upon the beach, a boat was sent to commence an  acquaintance with them; they however retired, and suffered Mr. Brown to  botanise without disturbance. Next morning [SATURDAY 31 July 1802] the  brig anchored within a quarter of a mile of the shore, to cover our  landing parties; and the armed boats being moored at grapnels, out of the  reach of the natives, we separated into three divisions. The naturalist's  party, consisting of six persons, walked along the shore towards the  upper part of the bay; Mr. Murray and his people went to cut wood for  fuel; and the party with me, also of six persons, including my native  friend _Bongaree_, went towards the extremity of Sandy Cape. Several  Indians with branches of trees in their hands, were there collected; and  whilst they retreated themselves, were waving to us to go back. Bongaree  stripped off his clothes and laid aside his spear, as inducements for  them to wait for him; but finding they did not understand his language,  the poor fellow, in the simplicity of his heart, addressed them in broken  English, hoping to succeed better. At length they suffered him to come  up, and by degrees our whole party joined; and after receiving some  presents, twenty of them returned with us to the boats, and were feasted  upon the blubber of two porpoises, which had been brought on shore  purposely for them. At two o'clock the naturalists returned, bringing  some of the scoop nets used by the natives in catching fish; and we then  quitted our new friends, after presenting them with hatchets and other  testimonials of our satisfaction.    These people go entirely naked, and otherwise much resemble the  inhabitants of Port Jackson in personal appearance; but they were more  fleshy, perhaps from being able to obtain a better supply of food with  the scoop nets, which are not known on the southern parts of the coast. I  noticed in most of them a hard tumour on the outer knuckle of the wrist,  which, if we understood them aright, was caused by the stretcher of the  scoop coming in contact with this part in the act of throwing the net.  Our native did not understand a word of their language, nor did they seem  to know the use of his _womerah_ or throwing stick; for one of them being  invited to imitate Bongaree, who lanced a spear with it very dexterously  and to a great distance, he, in the most awkward manner, threw both  womerah and spear together. Nothing like a canoe was seen amongst these  people; but they must have some means of passing over the water to short  distances, since I found, in 1799, that Curlew Islet, near the head of  this bay, had been visited.    A species of _pandanus_ before found at Glass-house and Shoal Bays, grows  in abundance upon Sandy Cape; and notwithstanding the extreme sterility  of the soil, the sand hills were mostly covered with bushes, and the  vallies contained trees of the _casuarina_ and _eucalyptus_. There was  fresh water in a pool near the shore, and as a ship may lie within half a  mile, both wood and water might be procured here without great  difficulty; but I doubt if the water would not altogether fail in the dry  season.    A tolerably regular tide set past the ship, N. N. E. and S. S. W., nearly  one mile an hour; and it appeared by the shore to be high water _about  eight hours after_ the moon's passage, and the common rise to be between  six and seven feet.    No mention has been made of the variation of the compass since leaving  Port Jackson, A gradual diminution seems to take place from Twofold Bay,  near the southern extremity of this coast, to Sandy Cape; as will appear  from the following observations.      Lat. 37 deg. 4' Azim., one compass, on shore,                    9 deg. 29' E.       33 52    do ,      do    ,     do  ,                    8  51       31 36    do ,      do    , head north,                  9   8       30 32    do , three comp.,     do    ,                  8  42       26 10    do , one comp., head N. by W.    8 deg. 40', corr. 8   7       25 0   Ampl.,      do  , head N.

E. 1/2  S. 6  33 , corr  8  14      The coast lies nearly north, and except Sandy Cape, appears to be mostly  of free stone, which I have not found to produce any effect upon the  needle; and what is remarkable, on comparing my observations with those  of captain Cook, it appeared that little or no change had taken place in  the variation, during thirty-two years; for wherever our observations  were taken with the ships heads in the same direction, there the same  variation was obtained to a few minutes.    Within Break-sea Spit, an amplitude gave the variation when corrected, 7 deg.  25' east; and one taken at the anchorage near Sandy Cape, but  uncorrected, the direction of the ship's head being unknown, 7 deg. 57' east.  There is little doubt that on bringing the land to the eastward of the  ship, the variation was diminished at least half a degree: the stone of  Sandy Cape is granitic.    SUNDAY 1 AUGUST 1802    In the morning of August 1, the wind was from the southward, and we  steered across Hervey's Bay, towards a sloping hummock on the west side,  where my examination in the Norfolk had terminated. The soundings  increased from 7, gradually to 18 fathoms, and afterwards decreased till  half past four in the afternoon; when the sloping hummock bore S. 2 deg. E.  eight miles, and we had no more than 31/2 fathoms near some dry banks and  breakers, which extend out three miles from two shallow inlets in the  coast. At dusk the anchor was let go in 61/2 fathoms, mud and sand; the  shallow inlets to the south being distant 6 miles, and the sloping  hummock bearing S. 17 deg. E. In captain Cook's chart, the width of Hervey's  Bay is fifty-nine miles, which had appeared to me too great when here in  the Norfolk; and I now made the distance, from the north-west extremity  of Sandy Cape to a low point running out from the hummock, to be forty  three miles by the _time keepers_. Such errors as this are almost  unavoidable without the aid of these instruments, when sailing either  along a coast which lies nearly on the same parallel, or where no land is  in sight to correct the longitude by bearings. From Port Jackson to Sandy  Cape, captain Cook's positions had been found to differ from mine, not  more than from 10' east to 7' west; which must be considered a great  degree of accuracy, considering the expeditious manner in which he sailed  along the coast, and that there were no time keepers on board the  Endeavour; but from Sandy Cape northward, where the direction of the  coast has a good deal of westing in it, greater differences began to show  themselves.    [EAST COAST. NEAR BUSTARD BAY.]    There was a little tide running past the ship in the first part of the  night from N. N. W., which appeared to be the flood setting into Hervey's  Bay. At daybreak [MONDAY 2 AUGUST 1802] we pursued our course along the  shore, at the distance of four or five miles, in soundings between 5 and  9 fathoms. The coast was low, but not sandy; and behind it was a range of  hills extending north-westward, and like the flat country, was not ill  clothed with wood. There was no remarkable projection till we came to the  south head of Bustard Bay; and the night being then at hand, we ran in  and anchored on a sandy bottom, in 41/2 fathoms, nearly in the same spot  where the Endeavour had lain thirty-two years before.    The rocky south head of Bustard Bay, from the survey between the  preceding and following noons, should lie in 24 deg. 9' south, and the time  keepers placed it in 151 deg. 52' east; or 5' south and 10' east of captain  Cook's situation; nor did the form of the Bay correspond to his chart.*  The variation observed a few miles from the anchorage, was 8 deg. 20' east,  with the ship's head N. W. by N., or 6 deg. 52' reduced to the meridian;  nearly as had been found in the morning, when it was 6 deg. 56' corrected.  This is a full degree less than it was on the east side of Sandy Cape,  and captain Cook's observations show a still greater diminution.    [* The latitude 24 deg. 4' was observed on board the Endeavour, at anchor  here; by whom is uncertain, but it was not by captain Cook or Mr. Green.  In the _Astronomical Observations_ of the voyage, p. 134, Mr. Wales, in  deducing the position of Bustard Bay, takes no notice of this  observation, and omits the latitude.]    TUESDAY 3 AUGUST 1802    At daylight we proceeded along the coast; but the wind being very light,  were no more than abreast of the north head of Bustard Bay at noon; and  the ship being drifted by the tide toward some rocks lying off the head,  a boat went to sound amongst them for a passage; in the mean time an air  sprung up at north; and having got the ship's head to the eastward, we  stretched off from the rocks. This north head lies in latitude 24 deg. 0', as  laid down by captain Cook, and bears from the south head N. 44 deg. W.,  twelve miles; it is moderately high, and behind it is a mass of hummocky,  barren hills, which extend far to the westward. A reef lies out as far as  two miles from the north head; but within the outer rock above water our  boat had 14 fathoms, and there was room for a ship to pass.    Not being able to weather the reef before dark, we worked to windward  during the night; bearing down frequently to the Lady Nelson, to prevent  separation. At daylight [WEDNESDAY 4 AUGUST 1802], the wind had shifted  gradually round, from north to the south-westward; and at noon the north  head of Bustard, Bay was brought to bear S. 16 deg. E., four leagues, our  latitude being then 23 deg. 48', and longitude 151 deg. 40'. "]]]
