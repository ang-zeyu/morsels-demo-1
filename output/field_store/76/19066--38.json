He would always find a cheery welcome waiting there for him. There is no  formality between ourselves and Spiller.\"    \"Quite so. An excellent arrangement, Smith. I like this spirit of  comradeship in my house. Then you will be with us on Saturday?\"    \"On Saturday, sir.\"    \"All this sort of thing, Spiller,\" said Psmith, as they closed the door,  \"is very, very trying for a man of culture. Look us up in our study one  of these afternoons.\"        5    GUERRILLA WARFARE      \"There are few pleasures,\" said Psmith, as he resumed his favorite  position against the mantelpiece and surveyed the commandeered study  with the pride of a householder, \"keener to the reflective mind than  sitting under one's own rooftree. This place would have been wasted on  Spiller; he would not have appreciated it properly.\"    Mike was finishing his tea. \"You're a jolly useful chap to have by you  in a crisis, Smith,\" he said with approval. \"We ought to have known each  other before.\"    \"The loss was mine,\" said Psmith courteously. \"We will now, with your  permission, face the future for a while. I suppose you realize that we  are now to a certain extent up against it. Spiller's hot Spanish blood  is not going to sit tight and do nothing under a blow like this.\"    \"What can he do? Outwood's given us the study.\"    \"What would you have done if somebody had bagged your study?\"    \"Made it jolly hot for them!\"    \"So will Comrade Spiller. I take it that he will collect a gang and make  an offensive movement against us directly he can. To all appearances we  are in a fairly tight place. It all depends on how big Comrade Spiller's  gang will be. I don't like rows, but I'm prepared to take on a  reasonable number of assailants in defense of the home.\"    Mike intimated that he was with him on the point. \"The difficulty is,  though,\" he said, \"about when we leave this room. I mean, we're all  right while we stick here, but we can't stay all night.\"    \"That's just what I was about to point out when you put it with such  admirable clearness. Here we are in a stronghold; they can only get at  us through the door, and we can lock that.\"    \"And jam a chair against it.\"    \"_And_, as you rightly remark, jam a chair against it. But what of the  nightfall? What of the time when we retire to our dormitory?\"    \"Or dormitories. I say, if we're in separate rooms we shall be in the  cart.\"    Psmith eyed Mike with approval. \"He thinks of everything! You're the  man, Comrade Jackson, to conduct an affair of this kind--such foresight!  such resource! We must see to this at once; if they put us in different  rooms we're done--we shall be destroyed singly in the watches of  the night.\"    \"We'd better nip down to the matron right off.\"    \"Not the matron--Comrade Outwood is the man. We are as sons to him;  there is nothing he can deny us. I'm afraid we are quite spoiling his  afternoon by these interruptions, but we must rout him out once more.\"    As they got up, the door handle rattled again, and this time there  followed a knocking.    \"This must be an emissary of Comrade Spiller's,\" said Psmith. \"Let us  parley with the man.\"    Mike unlocked the door. A light-haired youth with a cheerful, rather  vacant face and a receding chin strolled into the room, and stood  giggling with his hands in his pockets.    \"I just came up to have a look at you,\" he explained.    \"If you move a little to the left,\" said Psmith, \"you will catch the  light-and-shade effects on Jackson's face better.\"    The newcomer giggled with renewed vigor. \"Are you the chap with the  eyeglass who jaws all the time?\"    \"I _do_ wear an eyeglass,\" said Psmith; \"as to the rest of the  description--\"    \"My name's Jellicoe.\"    \"Mine is Psmith--P-s-m-i-t-h--one of the Shropshire Psmiths. The object  on the skyline is Comrade Jackson.\"    \"Old Spiller,\" giggled Jellicoe, \"is cursing you like anything  downstairs. You _are_ chaps! Do you mean to say you simply bagged his  study? He's making no end of a row about it.\"    \"Spiller's fiery nature is a byword,\" said Psmith.    \"What's he going to do?\" asked Mike, in his practical way.    \"He's going to get the chaps to turn you out.\"    \"As I suspected,\" sighed Psmith, as one mourning over the frailty of  human nature. \"About how many horny-handed assistants should you say  that he would be likely to bring? Will you, for instance, join the  glad throng?\"    \"Me? No fear! I think Spiller's an ass.\"    \"There's nothing like a common thought for binding people together. _I_  think Spiller's an ass.\"    \"How many _will_ there be, then?\" asked Mike.    \"He might get about half a dozen, not more, because most of the chaps  don't see why they should sweat themselves just because Spiller's study  has been bagged.\"    \"Sturdy common sense,\" said Psmith approvingly, \"seems to be the chief  virtue of the Sedleigh character.\"    \"We shall be able to tackle a crowd like that,\" said Mike. \"The only  thing is we must get into the same dormitory.\"    \"This is where Comrade Jellicoe's knowledge of the local geography will  come in useful. Do you happen to know of any snug little room, with,  say, about four beds in it? How many dormitories are there?\"    \"Five--there's one with three beds in it, only it belongs to three  chaps.\"    \"I believe in the equal distribution of property. We will go to Comrade  Outwood and stake out another claim.\"    Mr. Outwood received them even more beamingly than before. \"Yes, Smith?\"  he said.    \"We must apologize for disturbing you, sir--\"    \"Not at all, Smith, not at all! I like the boys in my house to come to  me when they wish for my advice or help.\"    \"We were wondering, sir, if you would have any objection to Jackson,  Jellicoe and myself sharing the dormitory with the three beds in it. A  very warm friendship ...\" explained Psmith, patting the gurgling  Jellicoe kindly on the shoulder, \"has sprung up between Jackson,  Jellicoe and myself.\"    \"You make friends easily, Smith. I like to see it--I like to see it.\"    \"And we can have the room, sir?\"    \"Certainly--certainly! Tell the matron as you go down.\"    \"And now,\" said Psmith, as they returned to the study, \"we may say that  we are in a fairly winning position. A vote of thanks to Comrade  Jellicoe for his valuable assistance.\"    \"You _are_ a chap!\" said Jellicoe.    The handle began to revolve again.    \"That door,\" said Psmith, \"is getting a perfect incubus! It cuts into  one's leisure cruelly.\"    This time it was a small boy. \"They told me to come up and tell you to  come down,\" he said.    Psmith looked at him searchingly through his eyeglass.    \"Who?\"    \"The senior day room chaps.\"    \"Spiller?\"    \"Spiller and Robinson and Stone, and some other chaps.\"    \"They want us to speak to them?\"    \"They told me to come up and tell you to come down.\"    \"Go and give Comrade Spiller our compliments and say that we can't come  down, but shall be delighted to see him up here. Things,\" he said, as  the messenger departed, \"are beginning to move. Better leave the door  open, I think; it will save trouble. Ah, come in, Comrade Spiller, what  can we do for you?\"    Spiller advanced into the study; the others waited outside, crowding in  the doorway.    \"Look here,\" said Spiller, \"are you going to clear out of here or not?\"    \"After Mr. Outwood's kindly thought in giving us the room? You suggest a  black and ungrateful action, Comrade Spiller.\"    \"You'll get it hot, if you don't.\"    \"We'll risk it,\" said Mike.    Jellicoe giggled in the background; the drama in the atmosphere appealed  to him. His was a simple and appreciative mind.    \"Come on, you chaps,\" cried Spiller suddenly.    There was an inward rush on the enemy's part, but Mike had been  watching. He grabbed Spiller by the shoulders and ran him back against  the advancing crowd. For a moment the doorway was blocked, then the  weight and impetus of Mike and Spiller prevailed, the enemy gave back,  and Mike, stepping into the room again, slammed the door and locked it.    \"A neat piece of work,\" said Psmith approvingly, adjusting his tie at  the looking glass. \"The preliminaries may now be considered over, the  first shot has been fired. The dogs of war are now loose.\"    A heavy body crashed against the door.    \"They'll have it down,\" said Jellicoe.    \"We must act, Comrade Jackson! Might I trouble you just to turn that key  quietly, and the handle, and then to stand by for the next attack.\"    There was a scrambling of feet in the passage outside, and then a  repetition of the onslaught on the door. This time, however, the door,  instead of resisting, swung open, and the human battering ram staggered  through into the study. Mike, turning after relocking the door, was just  in time to see Psmith, with a display of energy of which one would not  have believed him capable, grip the invader scientifically by an arm  and a leg.    Mike jumped to help, but it was needless; the captive was already on the  windowsill. As Mike arrived, Psmith dropped him onto the  flowerbed below.    Psmith closed the window gently and turned to Jellicoe. \"Who was our  guest?\" he asked, dusting the knees of his trousers where they had  pressed against the wall.    \"Robinson. I say, you _are_ a chap!\"    \"Robinson, was it? Well, we are always glad to see Comrade Robinson,  always. I wonder if anybody else is thinking of calling?\"    Apparently frontal attack had been abandoned. Whisperings could be heard  in the corridor.    Somebody hammered on the door.    \"Yes?\" called Psmith patiently.    \"You'd better come out, you know; you'll only get it hotter if you  don't.\"    \"Leave us, Spiller; we would be alone.\"    A bell rang in the distance.    \"Tea,\" said Jellicoe; \"we shall have to go now.\"    \"They won't do anything till after tea, I shouldn't think,\" said Mike.  \"There's no harm in going out.\"    The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10589"],[0,"Turkish Prisoners in Egypt (#5)"],[1,"patients; 4 from  chronic nephritis.

The Cairo Citadel Camp.~    _(Visited on January 3, 1917.)_      This camp occupies the curious Jewel-Palace, one of the monuments of the  citadel, and contains only women and children coming from Hedjaz, who  were captured near Mecca.    The dates of arrival are as follows:      Women and Children.    1st convoy of 123       September 11, 1916    2nd   \"    \"   66         October 16, 1916    3rd   \"    \"   26            \"    28, 1916    4th   \"    \"   82         November 7, 1916    5th   \"    \"  132            \"    29, 1916      _Numbers._--The total includes 229 women and 207 children (7 of whom  were born in camp), and a further batch of 200 women is expected  shortly.    _The Head Matron_ is Miss Lewis. It is she who has the management and  full control of this camp, which, by its character and its diversity of  nationalities, classes and religions, demands great patience, tact and  kindness--qualities possessed in the highest degree by Miss Lewis. She  devotes herself entirely, and most capably, to this often very  ungrateful task, and we welcome this chance of conveying to her the  expression of our appreciation.    Those interned are divided into three classes. The first class consists  of officers' wives and children; the second class, of those of the  non-commissioned officers; and the third class, of soldiers' wives and  servants. This classification has been adopted in order that the  dormitories shall be occupied by persons of as nearly as possible the  same social standing.      _Accommodation._--The important group of buildings known as Saleh-el-din  (Saladin) comprises a great number of rooms whose size and curious  ornateness contrast strangely with their present use as a concentration  camp for civilian prisoners. From the windows of these apartments one  looks across the panorama of Cairo, with its mosques, its minarets and  the misty background of the desert.    The 40 inhabited rooms are allotted in three sections, corresponding to  the social classification established for the interned women.    The rooms and corridors are paved throughout with marble, but the  general distribution of mats and even beautiful carpets gives an  impression of comfort. The large dimensions of the chambers, as compared  with the smallness of the number of occupants, give plenty of room for  exercise and work. Corridors and vestibules connect the different  buildings. They are lighted with paraffin lamps.    An extensive garden is always at the prisoners' disposal.      _Bedding._--The japanned iron bedsteads are furnished with spring and  stuffed mattresses, sheets, blankets, and pillows. In their arrangement  one notices the influence of personal taste. Embroidered coverlets,  hangings and upholstery give to some of the apartments an aspect of  comfort and even of elegance. The military administration supplies all  the furniture and the regulation bedding, to which the inmates may add  what they like at their own expense.      _Dress._--The English authorities supply women and children with all  their linen and other clothing.      _Food._--Provisioning is a private enterprise, carried out under a  contract. The food is the same for all classes, and is unlimited in  quantity. The women are given as much as they desire of each dish. No  complaint was made concerning the food, which is wholesome and  palatable. We visited the kitchen and sampled the day's menu. Milk in  large quantities is provided for the children. The meals are served in  three well-appointed dining-rooms.    The hours for meals are:    Breakfast, from 7.30 to 8.30.    Lunch, from 12.30 to 1.80.    Supper, from 5.30 to 6.80.      _Hygiene._--Water is supplied from the town mains. Lavatories are  installed in the corridors near the dormitories. The inmates may have  hot and cold baths every day. As to laundry work, those of the first  class can have it done by their own servants or pay the third-class  women to do it.    The W.C.'s consist of movable tubs on the Turkish system, each  containing a solution of cresol. They are emptied daily by contract into  the citadel cesspool, which communicates with the main sewer of Cairo.      _Medical Care and Illnesses._--The Head Physician, Captain Scrimgeour,  comes to the camp every day; a Greek doctor also visits it four times a  week at 9 o'clock in the morning. These two doctors both speak Turkish  and Arabic fluently. Three trained nurses and an English midwife take  charge of the infirmary. As Moslems usually have very good teeth, the  services of a dentist are not often needed.    The infirmary is very commodious. It consists of a consulting-room, with  a couch for examinations; a surgery, and a sick ward.    In the infirmary register the name, the disease, the treatment and the  course of the illness are all duly noted.    When the internment camp was opened a hundred prisoners applied for  treatment daily; many had suffered great privations previous to their  capture. At the present time only 5 or 10 patients take advantage of the  doctor's visit; and these are mild cases, chiefly bronchitis,  constipation, diarrhoea, and eye affections among women and children,  and some cases of heart affections and chronic bronchitis among the old  people.    There is neither malaria, dysentery nor typhus in the camp, and no  epidemic malady. An early case of tuberculosis, without Koch's bacillus  in the sputa, was cured.    On the day of our visit to the infirmary we found 5 patients in bed or  crouched in the oriental manner upon their bedsteads; 1 suffering from  senile paralysis, 2 from bronchitis, 1 from inflammation of the ears,  and 1 from general debility.      _Maternity._--Confinements not being uncommon, it was necessary to  establish a maternity ward. There were 5 births during the last three  months of 1915. Two more occurred upon the day we inspected the camp,  mothers and infants doing well.      _Deaths._--Up to that time there had only been one death at the Citadel  Camp, that of a baby prematurely born, which died from debility at the  age of 18 days.      _Education._--A school has been started in the camp, and all boys as  well as girls up to 12 years old are obliged to attend it. A mistress  teaches them Turkish and Arabic, and also gives them half an hour's  instruction in English daily.      _Religious Services._--The imaum came once to hold a Mahometan service,  but the interned women expressed no desire that he should repeat his  visit. However, an old woman, chosen from among them, reads the Koran  aloud upon feast days.      _Intellectual Diversions._--The women seem to have no needs or desires  on this score. They pass their days in talking and smoking.    The camp has been presented with a gramophone.      _Work._--This is absolutely voluntary. The head nurse has organised a  little dressmaking class, the wife of a former president, Sir B.  McMahon, having given her L10 with which to buy the necessary materials.  The results will be divided equally among those who did the work, but as  most of the women have plenty of money they are not energetic over it.      _Money._--Many of those interned had money on them, sometimes a large  amount, when captured; the whole of which has been left in their hands.  They often send money through the agency of British officers to their  husbands who are prisoners in Maadi Camp, or at Sidi Bishr, near  Alexandria. Others, on the contrary, receive allowances from their  husbands. Some money orders have also come through the International Red  Cross Committee.      _Correspondence._--Each person interned has the chance of writing once a  week; those who do not know how to write get help from their companions.  An interpreter is attached to the camp. Many letters arrive through the  medium of the International Red Cross Committee, but the exchange of  correspondence is not generally very active.      _Wishes of the Interned._--Some of the women express a wish to see their  husbands more often, at least once a month; others wish to see their  sons or brothers who are prisoners at Maadi or at Sidi Bishr. This being  a legitimate and comprehensible desire, the English Government has  several times already allowed the husbands to come from these camps (4  hours distant by train) to spend three or four days with their wives in  the Citadel. A part of the building containing 12 rooms has been  reserved for these visits. But it would clearly be impossible to permit  these indulgences often, as they entail"]]]
