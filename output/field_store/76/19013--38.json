[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#4)"],[1,"he could get his back against the door he could then tap upon its base,  when surely he must be heard.  The knocking was repeated a little  louder, and finally a voice called:  \"Mr. Jack!\"    It was one of the house men--Mr. Moore recognized the fellow's voice.  He came near to bursting a blood vessel in an endeavor to scream \"come  in\" through the stifling gag.  After a moment the man knocked again,  quite loudly and again called the boy's name.  Receiving no reply he  turned the knob, and at the same instant a sudden recollection filled  the tutor anew with numbing terror--he had, himself, locked the door  behind him when he had entered the room.    He heard the servant try the door several times and then depart.  Upon  which Mr. Moore swooned.    In the meantime Jack was enjoying to the full the stolen pleasures of  the music hall.  He had reached the temple of mirth just as Ajax's act  was commencing, and having purchased a box seat was now leaning  breathlessly over the rail watching every move of the great ape, his  eyes wide in wonder.  The trainer was not slow to note the boy's  handsome, eager face, and as one of Ajax's biggest hits consisted in an  entry to one or more boxes during his performance, ostensibly in search  of a long-lost relative, as the trainer explained, the man realized the  effectiveness of sending him into the box with the handsome boy, who,  doubtless, would be terror stricken by proximity to the shaggy,  powerful beast.    When the time came, therefore, for the ape to return from the wings in  reply to an encore the trainer directed its attention to the boy who  chanced to be the sole occupant of the box in which he sat.  With a  spring the huge anthropoid leaped from the stage to the boy's side; but  if the trainer had looked for a laughable scene of fright he was  mistaken.  A broad smile lighted the boy's features as he laid his hand  upon the shaggy arm of his visitor.  The ape, grasping the boy by  either shoulder, peered long and earnestly into his face, while the  latter stroked his head and talked to him in a low voice.    Never had Ajax devoted so long a time to an examination of another as  he did in this instance.  He seemed troubled and not a little excited,  jabbering and mumbling to the boy, and now caressing him, as the  trainer had never seen him caress a human being before.  Presently he  clambered over into the box with him and snuggled down close to the  boy's side.  The audience was delighted; but they were still more  delighted when the trainer, the period of his act having elapsed,  attempted to persuade Ajax to leave the box.  The ape would not budge.  The manager, becoming excited at the delay, urged the trainer to  greater haste, but when the latter entered the box to drag away the  reluctant Ajax he was met by bared fangs and menacing growls.    The audience was delirious with joy.  They cheered the ape.  They  cheered the boy, and they hooted and jeered at the trainer and the  manager, which luckless individual had inadvertently shown himself and  attempted to assist the trainer.    Finally, reduced to desperation and realizing that this show of mutiny  upon the part of his valuable possession might render the animal  worthless for exhibition purposes in the future if not immediately  subdued, the trainer had hastened to his dressing room and procured a  heavy whip.  With this he now returned to the box; but when he had  threatened Ajax with it but once he found himself facing two infuriated  enemies instead of one, for the boy had leaped to his feet, and seizing  a chair was standing ready at the ape's side to defend his new found  friend.  There was no longer a smile upon his handsome face.  In his  gray eyes was an expression which gave the trainer pause, and beside  him stood the giant anthropoid growling and ready.    What might have happened, but for a timely interruption, may only be  surmised; but that the trainer would have received a severe mauling, if  nothing more, was clearly indicated by the attitudes of the two who  faced him.      It was a pale-faced man who rushed into the Greystoke library to  announce that he had found Jack's door locked and had been able to  obtain no response to his repeated knocking and calling other than a  strange tapping and the sound of what might have been a body moving  about upon the floor.    Four steps at a time John Clayton took the stairs that led to the floor  above.  His wife and the servant hurried after him.  Once he called his  son's name in a loud voice; but receiving no reply he launched his  great weight, backed by all the undiminished power of his giant  muscles, against the heavy door.  With a snapping of iron butts and a  splintering of wood the obstacle burst inward.    At its foot lay the body of the unconscious Mr. Moore, across whom it  fell with a resounding thud.  Through the opening leaped Tarzan, and a  moment later the room was flooded with light from a dozen electric  bulbs.    It was several minutes before the tutor was discovered, so completely  had the door covered him; but finally he was dragged forth, his gag and  bonds cut away, and a liberal application of cold water had hastened  returning consciousness.    \"Where is Jack?\" was John Clayton's first question, and then; \"Who did  this?\" as the memory of Rokoff and the fear of a second abduction  seized him.    Slowly Mr. Moore staggered to his feet.  His gaze wandered about the  room.  Gradually he collected his scattered wits.  The details of his  recent harrowing experience returned to him.    \"I tender my resignation, sir, to take effect at once,\" were his first  words.  \"You do not need a tutor for your son--what he needs is a wild  animal trainer.\"    \"But where is he?\" cried Lady Greystoke.    \"He has gone to see Ajax.\"    It was with difficulty that Tarzan restrained a smile, and after  satisfying himself that the tutor was more scared than injured, he  ordered his closed car around and departed in the direction of a  certain well-known music hall.          Chapter 3      As the trainer, with raised lash, hesitated an instant at the entrance  to the box where the boy and the ape confronted him, a tall  broad-shouldered man pushed past him and entered.  As his eyes fell  upon the newcomer a slight flush mounted the boy's cheeks.    \"Father!\" he exclaimed.    The ape gave one look at the English lord, and then leaped toward him,  calling out in excited jabbering.  The man, his eyes going wide in  astonishment, stopped as though turned to stone.    \"Akut!\" he cried.    The boy looked, bewildered, from the ape to his father, and from his  father to the ape.  The trainer's jaw dropped as he listened to what  followed, for from the lips of the Englishman flowed the gutturals of  an ape that were answered in kind by the huge anthropoid that now clung  to him.    And from the wings a hideously bent and disfigured old man watched the  tableau in the box, his pock-marked features working spasmodically in  varying expressions that might have marked every sensation in the gamut  from pleasure to terror.    \"Long have I looked for you, Tarzan,\" said Akut.  \"Now that I have  found you I shall come to your jungle and live there always.\"    The man stroked the beast's head.  Through his mind there was running  rapidly a train of recollection that carried him far into the depths of  the primeval African forest where this huge, man-like beast had fought  shoulder to shoulder with him years before.  He saw the black Mugambi  wielding his deadly knob-stick, and beside them, with bared fangs and  bristling whiskers, Sheeta the terrible; and pressing close behind the  savage and the savage panther, the hideous apes of Akut.  The man  sighed.  Strong within him surged the jungle lust that he had thought  dead.  Ah! if he could go back even for a brief month of it, to feel  again the brush of leafy branches against his naked hide; to smell the  musty rot of dead vegetation--frankincense and myrrh to the jungle  born; to sense the noiseless coming of the great carnivora upon his  trail; to hunt and to be hunted; to kill!  The picture was alluring.  And then came another picture--a sweet-faced woman, still young and  beautiful; friends; a home; a son.  He shrugged his giant shoulders.    \"It cannot be, Akut,\" he said; \"but if you would return, I shall see  that it is done.  You could not be happy here--I may not be happy  there.\"    The trainer stepped forward.  The ape bared his fangs, growling.    \"Go with him, Akut,\" said Tarzan of the Apes.  \"I will come and see you  tomorrow.\"    The beast moved sullenly to the trainer's side.  The latter, at John  Clayton's request, told where they might be found.  Tarzan turned  toward his son.    \"Come!\" he said, and the two left the theater.  Neither spoke for  several minutes after they had entered the limousine.  It was the boy  who broke the silence.    \"The ape knew you,\" he said, \"and you spoke together in the ape's  tongue.  How did the ape know you, and how did you learn his language?\"    And then, briefly and for the first time, Tarzan of the Apes told his  son of his early life--of the birth in the jungle, of the death of his  parents, and of how Kala, the great she ape had suckled and raised him  from infancy almost to manhood.  He told him, too, of the dangers and  the horrors of the jungle; of the great beasts that stalked one by day  and by night; of the periods of drought, and of the cataclysmic rains;  of hunger; of cold; of intense heat; of nakedness and fear and  suffering.  He told him of all those things that seem most horrible to  the creature of civilization in the hope that the knowledge of them  might expunge from the lad's mind any inherent desire for the jungle.  Yet they were the very things that made the memory of the jungle what  it was to Tarzan--that made up the composite jungle life he loved.  And  in the telling he forgot one thing--the principal thing--that the boy  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/903"],[0,"The White Company (#4)"],[1," violent  man, there is the more need that I should seek him out and see whether I  cannot turn him to better ways.\"    The Abbot shook his head. \"The Socman of Minstead hath earned an evil  name over the country side,\" he said. \"If you must go to him, see at  least that he doth not turn you from the narrow path upon which you have  learned to tread. But you are in God's keeping, and Godward should you  ever look in danger and in trouble. Above all, shun the snares of women,  for they are ever set for the foolish feet of the young. Kneel down, my  child, and take an old man's blessing.\"    Alleyne Edricson bent his head while the Abbot poured out his heartfelt  supplication that Heaven would watch over this young soul, now going  forth into the darkness and danger of the world. It was no mere form for  either of them. To them the outside life of mankind did indeed seem to  be one of violence and of sin, beset with physical and still more with  spiritual danger. Heaven, too, was very near to them in those days.  God's direct agency was to be seen in the thunder and the rainbow,  the whirlwind and the lightning. To the believer, clouds of angels and  confessors, and martyrs, armies of the sainted and the saved, were  ever stooping over their struggling brethren upon earth, raising,  encouraging, and supporting them. It was then with a lighter heart and  a stouter courage that the young man turned from the Abbot's room, while  the latter, following him to the stair-head, finally commended him to  the protection of the holy Julian, patron of travellers.    Underneath, in the porch of the Abbey, the monks had gathered to give  him a last God-speed. Many had brought some parting token by which he  should remember them. There was brother Bartholomew with a crucifix of  rare carved ivory, and brother Luke with a white-backed psalter  adorned with golden bees, and brother Francis with the \"Slaying of the  Innocents\" most daintily set forth upon vellum. All these were  duly packed away deep in the traveller's scrip, and above them old  pippin-faced brother Athanasius had placed a parcel of simnel bread and  rammel cheese, with a small flask of the famous blue-sealed Abbey wine.  So, amid hand-shakings and laughings and blessings, Alleyne Edricson  turned his back upon Beaulieu.    At the turn of the road he stopped and gazed back. There was the  wide-spread building which he knew so well, the Abbot's house, the long  church, the cloisters with their line of arches, all bathed and mellowed  in the evening sun. There too was the broad sweep of the river Exe, the  old stone well, the canopied niche of the Virgin, and in the centre of  all the cluster of white-robed figures who waved their hands to him. A  sudden mist swam up before the young man's eyes, and he turned away upon  his journey with a heavy heart and a choking throat.        CHAPTER III. HOW HORDLE JOHN COZENED THE FULLER OF LYMINGTON.      It is not, however, in the nature of things that a lad of twenty, with  young life glowing in his veins and all the wide world before him,  should spend his first hours of freedom in mourning for what he had  left. Long ere Alleyne was out of sound of the Beaulieu bells he was  striding sturdily along, swinging his staff and whistling as merrily as  the birds in the thicket. It was an evening to raise a man's heart. The  sun shining slantwise through the trees threw delicate traceries across  the road, with bars of golden light between. Away in the distance  before and behind, the green boughs, now turning in places to a coppery  redness, shot their broad arches across the track. The still summer air  was heavy with the resinous smell of the great forest. Here and there a  tawny brook prattled out from among the underwood and lost itself again  in the ferns and brambles upon the further side. Save the dull piping of  insects and the sough of the leaves, there was silence everywhere--the  sweet restful silence of nature.    And yet there was no want of life--the whole wide wood was full of it.  Now it was a lithe, furtive stoat which shot across the path upon some  fell errand of its own; then it was a wild cat which squatted upon the  outlying branch of an oak and peeped at the traveller with a yellow and  dubious eye. Once it was a wild sow which scuttled out of the bracken,  with two young sounders at her heels, and once a lordly red staggard  walked daintily out from among the tree trunks, and looked around  him with the fearless gaze of one who lived under the King's own high  protection. Alleyne gave his staff a merry flourish, however, and the  red deer bethought him that the King was far off, so streaked away from  whence he came.    The youth had now journeyed considerably beyond the furthest domains of  the Abbey. He was the more surprised therefore when, on coming round a  turn in the path, he perceived a man clad in the familiar garb of the  order, and seated in a clump of heather by the roadside. Alleyne had  known every brother well, but this was a face which was new to him--a  face which was very red and puffed, working this way and that, as  though the man were sore perplexed in his mind. Once he shook both hands  furiously in the air, and twice he sprang from his seat and hurried down  the road. When he rose, however, Alleyne observed that his robe was much  too long and loose for him in every direction, trailing upon the ground  and bagging about his ankles, so that even with trussed-up skirts he  could make little progress. He ran once, but the long gown clogged him  so that he slowed down into a shambling walk, and finally plumped into  the heather once more.    \"Young friend,\" said he, when Alleyne was abreast of him, \"I fear from  thy garb that thou canst know little of the Abbey of Beaulieu.\"    \"Then you are in error, friend,\" the clerk answered, \"for I have spent  all my days within its walls.\"    \"Hast so indeed?\" cried he. \"Then perhaps canst tell me the name of  a great loathly lump of a brother wi' freckled face an' a hand like a  spade. His eyes were black an' his hair was red an' his voice like  the parish bull. I trow that there cannot be two alike in the same  cloisters.\"    \"That surely can be no other than brother John,\" said Alleyne. \"I trust  he has done you no wrong, that you should be so hot against him.\"    \"Wrong, quotha?\" cried the other, jumping out of the heather. \"Wrong!  why he hath stolen every plack of clothing off my back, if that be a  wrong, and hath left me here in this sorry frock of white falding, so  that I have shame to go back to my wife, lest she think that I have  donned her old kirtle. Harrow and alas that ever I should have met him!\"    \"But how came this?\" asked the young clerk, who could scarce keep from  laughter at the sight of the hot little man so swathed in the great  white cloak.    \"It came in this way,\" he said, sitting down once more: \"I was passing  this way, hoping to reach Lymington ere nightfall when I came on this  red-headed knave seated even where we are sitting now. I uncovered and  louted as I passed thinking that he might be a holy man at his orisons,  but he called to me and asked me if I had heard speak of the new  indulgence in favor of the Cistercians. 'Not I,' I answered. 'Then the  worse for thy soul!' said he; and with that he broke into a long tale  how that on account of the virtues of the Abbot Berghersh it had been  decreed by the Pope that whoever should wear the habit of a monk of  Beaulieu for as long as he might say the seven psalms of David should be  assured of the kingdom of Heaven. When I heard this I prayed him on  my knees that he would give me the use of his gown, which after many  contentions he at last agreed to do, on my paying him three marks  towards the regilding of the image of Laurence the martyr. Having  stripped his robe, I had no choice but to let him have the wearing of my  good leathern jerkin and hose, for, as he said, it was chilling to  the blood and unseemly to the eye to stand frockless whilst I made my  orisons. He had scarce got them on, and it was a sore labor, seeing that  my inches will scarce match my girth--he had scarce got them on, I say,  and I not yet at the end of the second psalm, when he bade me do honor  to my new dress, and with that set off down the road as fast as feet  would carry him. For myself, I could no more run than if I had been sown  in a sack; so here I sit, and here I am like to sit, before I set eyes  upon my clothes again.\"    \"Nay, friend, take it not so sadly,\" said Alleyne, clapping the  disconsolate one upon the shoulder. \"Canst change thy robe for a jerkin  once more at the Abbey, unless perchance you have a friend near at  hand.\"    \"That have I,\" he answered, \"and close; but I care not to go nigh him in  this plight, for his wife hath a gibing tongue, and will spread the  tale until I could not show my face in any market from Fordingbridge  to Southampton. But if you, fair sir, out of your kind charity would be  pleased to go a matter of two bow-shots out of your way, you would do me  such a service as I could scarce repay.\"    \"With all my heart,\" said Alleyne readily.    \"Then take this pathway on the left, I pray thee, and then the  deer-track which passes on the right. You will then see under a great  beech-tree the hut of a charcoal-burner. Give him my name, good sir,  the name of Peter the fuller, of Lymington, and ask him for a change of  raiment, that I may pursue my journey without delay. There are reasons  why he would be loth to refuse me.\"    Alleyne started off along the path indicated, and soon found the log-hut  where the burner dwelt. He was away faggot-cutting in the forest, but  his wife, a ruddy bustling dame, found the needful garments and tied  them into a bundle. While she busied herself in finding and folding  them, Alleyne Edricson stood by the open door looking in at her with  much interest and some distrust, for he had never been so nigh to"]]]
