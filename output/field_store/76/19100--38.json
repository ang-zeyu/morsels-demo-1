[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11277"],[0,"Egyptian Ideas of the Future Life (#5)"],[1,"He protecteth him that followeth    Him.\"    We have now to consider the visible emblem, and the type and symbol of  God, namely the Sun-god R[=a], who was worshipped in Egypt in  prehistoric times. According to the writings of the Egyptians, there was  a time when neither heaven nor earth existed, and when nothing had being  except the boundless primeval [Footnote: See Brugsch, _Religion_, p.  101.] water, which was, however, shrouded with thick darkness. In this  condition the primeval water remained for a considerable time,  notwithstanding that it contained within it the germs of the things  which afterwards came into existence in this world, and the world  itself. At length the spirit of the primeval water felt the desire for  creative activity, and having uttered the word, the world sprang  straightway into being in the form which had already been depicted in  the mind of the spirit before he spake the word which resulted in its  creation. The next act of creation, was the formation of a germ, or egg,  from which sprang R[=a], the Sun-god, within whose shining form was  embodied the almighty power of the divine spirit.    Such was the outline of creation as described by the late Dr. H.  Brugsch, and it is curious to see how closely his views coincide with a  chapter in the _Papyrus of Nesi Amsu_ preserved in the British Museum.  [Footnote: No. 10,188. See my transcript and translation of the whole  papyrus in _Archaeologia_ vol. 52, London, 1801.] In the third section  of this papyrus we find a work which was written with the sole object of  overthrowing [=A]pep, the great enemy of R[=a], and in the composition  itself we find two versions of the chapter which describes the creation  of the earth and all things therein. The god Neb-er-tcher is the  speaker, and he says:--      \"I evolved the evolving of evolutions. I evolved myself under the form    of the evolutions of the god Khepera, which were evolved at the    beginning of all time. I evolved with the evolutions of the god    Khepera; I evolved by the evolution of evolutions--that is to say, I    developed myself from the primeval matter which I made, I developed    myself out of the primeval matter. My name is Ausares (Osiris), the    germ of primeval matter. I have wrought my will wholly in this earth,    I have spread abroad and filled it, I have strengthened it [with] my    hand. I was alone, for nothing had been brought forth; I had not then    emitted from myself either Shu or Tefnut. I uttered my own name, as a    word of power, from my own mouth, and I straightway evolved myself. I    evolved myself under the form of the evolutions of the god Khepera,    and I developed myself out of the primeval matter which has evolved    multitudes of evolutions from the beginning of time. Nothing existed    on this earth then, and I made all things. There was none other who    worked with me at that time. I performed all evolutions there by means    of that divine Soul which I fashioned there, and which had remained    inoperative in the watery abyss. I found no place there whereon to    stand. But I was strong in my heart, and I made a foundation for    myself, and I made everything which was made. I was alone. I made a    foundation for my heart (_or_ will), and I created multitudes of    things which evolved themselves like unto the evolutions of the god    Khepera, and their offspring came into being from the evolutions of    their births. I emitted from myself the gods Shu and Tefnut, and from    being One I became Three; they [Illustration: THE CREATION. The god Nu    rising out of the primeval water and bearing in his hands the boat of    R[=a], the Sun-god, who is accompanied by a number of deities. In the    upper portion of the scene is the region of the underworld which is    enclosed by the body of Osiris, on whose head stands the goddess Nut    with arms stretched out to receive the disk of the sun.] sprang from    me, and came into existence in this earth. ...Shu and Tefnut brought    forth Seb and Nut, and Nut brought forth Osiris, Horus-khent-an-maa,    Sut, Isis, and Nephthya at one birth.\"    The fact of the existence of two versions of this remarkable Chapter  proves that the composition is much older than the papyrus [Footnote:  About B.C. 300.] in which it is found, and the variant readings which  occur in each make it certain that the Egyptian scribes had difficulty  in understanding what they were writing. It may be said that this  version of the cosmogony is incomplete because it does not account for  the origin of any of the gods except those who belong to the cycle of  Osiris, and this objection is a valid one; but in this place we are only  concerned to shew that R[=a], the Sun-god, was evolved from the primeval  abyss of water by the agency of the god Khepera, who brought this result  about by pronouncing his own name. The great cosmic gods, such as Ptah  and Khnemu, of whom mention will be made later, are the offspring of  another set of religious views, and the cosmogony in which these play  the leading parts is entirely different. We must notice, in passing,  that the god whose words we have quoted above declares that he evolved  himself under the form, of Khepera, and that his name is Osiris, \"the  primeval matter of primeval matter,\" and that, as a result, Osiris is  identical with Khepera in respect of his evolutions and new births. The  word rendered \"evolutions\" is _kheperu_, literally \"rollings\"; and that  rendered \"primeval matter\" is _paut_, the original \"stuff\" out of which  everything was made. In both versions we are told that men and women  came into being from the tears which fell from the \"Eye\" of Khepera,  that is to say from the Sun, which, the god says, \"I made take to up its  place in my face, and afterwards it ruled the whole earth.\"    We have seen how R[=a] has become the visible type and symbol of God,  and the creator of the world and of all that is therein; we may now  consider the position which he held with, respect to the dead. As far  back as the period of the IVth dynasty, about B.C. 3700, he was regarded  as the great god of heaven, and the king of all the gods, and divine  beings, and of the beatified dead who dwelt therein. The position of the  beatified in heaven is decided by R[=a], and of all the gods there  Osiris only appears to have the power to claim protection for his  followers; the offerings which the deceased would make to R[=a] are  actually presented to him by Osiris. At one time the Egyptian's greatest  hope seems to have been that he might not only become \"God, the son of  God,\" by adoption, but that R[=a] would become actually his father. For  in the text of Pepi I, [Footnote: Ed. Maspero, line 570.] it is said:  \"Pepi is the son of R[=a] who loveth him; and he goeth forth and raiseth  himself up to heaven. R[=a] hath begotten Pepi, and he goeth forth and  raiseth himself up to heaven. R[=a] hath conceived Pepi, and he goeth  forth and raiseth himself up to heaven. R[=a] hath given birth, to  Pepi, and he goeth forth and raiseth himself up to heaven.\"  Substantially these ideas remained the same from the earliest to the  latest times, and R[=a] maintained his position as the great head of the  companies, notwithstanding the rise of Amen into prominence, and the  attempt to make Aten the dominant god of Egypt by the so-called \"Disk  worshippers.\" The following good typical examples of Hymns to R[=a] are  taken from the oldest copies of the Theban Recension of the Book of the  Dead.      I. FROM THE PAPYRUS OF ANI. [Footnote: See _The Chapters of Coming Forth  by Day_, p. 3.]      \"Homage to thee, O thou who hast come as Khepera, Khepera the creator    of the gods. Thou risest and thou shinest, and thou makest light to be    in thy mother Nut (_i.e._, the sky); thou art crowned king of the    gods. Thy mother Nut doeth an act of homage unto thee with both her    hands. The laud of Manu (_i.e._, the land where the sun sets)    receiveth thee with satisfaction, and the goddess Ma[=a]t embraceth    thee both, at morn and at eve. [Footnote: _i.e._, Ma[=a]t, the goddess    of law, order, regularity, and the like, maketh the sun to rise each    day in his appointed place and at his appointed time with absolute and    unfailing regularity.] Hail, all ye gods of the Temple of the Soul,    [Footnote: _i.e._, the soul referred to above in the account of the    creation; see p. 24.] who weigh heaven and earth in the balance, and    who provide divine food in abundance! Hail, Tatunen, thou One, thou    Creator of mankind and Maker of the substance of the gods of the south    and of the north, of the west and of the east! O come ye and acclaim    R[=a], the lord of heaven and the Creator of the gods, and adore ye    him in his beautiful form as he cometh in the morning in his divine    bark.      \"O R[=a], those who dwell in the heights and those who dwell in the    depths adore thee. The god Thoth and the goddess Ma[=a]t have marked    out for thee [thy course] for each and every day. Thine enemy the    Serpent hath been given over to the fire, the serpent-fiend Sebau hath    fallen down headlong; his arms have been bound in chains, and thou    hast hacked off his legs; and the sons of impotent revolt shall    nevermore rise up against thee. The Temple of the Aged One [Footnote:    _i.e._, R[=a] of Heliopolis.] (_i.e._, R[=a]) keepeth festival, and    the voice of those who rejoice is in the mighty dwelling. The gods    exult when they see thy rising, O R[=a], and when thy beams flood the    world with light. The Majesty of the holy god goeth forth and    advanceth even unto the land of Manu; he maketh brilliant the earth at    his birth each day; he journeyeth on to the place where he was    yesterday.\"      II. FROM THE PAPYRUS OF HUNEFER. [Footnote: From the Papyrus of Hunefer  (Brit. Mus. No. 9901).]      \"Homage to thee, O thou who art R[=a] when thou risest and Temu when    thou"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11281"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 12, No. 334, (#5)"],[1," liquors, and after a time he draws the skin  out, and finds that it is converted into leather. A thick piece of hide  requires ten, twelve, or fourteen months, to be converted into good  leather; and when you consider the length of time consumed in the  process, and the great capital necessarily employed, you cannot feel  surprised that various plans should have been proposed to lessen both.  It was proposed to tan with warm instead of cold liquors; and although  the tan appeared to promote the skins in a shorter time, the quality of  the leather was so much injured, that it was soon given up. Then it was  tried to force the tan through the pores of the skin, by employing great  pressure; but this was not found to answer. But you may ask why the  tanner does not put the skins at once into a strong liquor? The reason  is, that the exterior surface of the skin would soon become tanned, and  the central part would remain untanned, which, in a short time, would  begin to rot and decay, and the leather so treated would soon fall to  pieces. The tanner, therefore, judges of the perfection of the tanning  by cutting through the leather; and if he finds it of an uniform brown  colour, without any white streak in the centre, he considers that the  process has been successfully conducted. It would require much time to  describe all the operations of the _tan-yard_, but many of them are  interesting, as regards the chemical agents employed. I might have  mentioned to you, that the mode of preparing the skin for tanning, is  first to soak it in lime-water, by which the hair is easily detached;  but the cuticle and under part of the skin, the cellular substance, are  scraped off after it has been soaked in the lime water. A great variety  of substances have been used for tanning, as the acorn-cup of the  oriental bark; catechu and sumach have been also used; but the oak bark  is most generally used, as furnishing a large quantity of astringent  matter. It is not the business of the chemist to describe the different  kinds of leather, but I may just mention, that the upper leather of  shoes is called _curried_ leather; the leather having been tanned, is  rubbed over with oil before it is dried, and it is then very flexible,  pliable, and durable; but if you take a piece of dry leather, and try to  rub it over with oil or grease, you cannot make it enter the pores of  the leather; the black colour is produced by rubbing it over with a  solution of green vitriol, the sulphate of iron. _Russian_ leather is  tanned in an infusion of birch bark, and is said to be afterwards mixed  with a quantity of birch tar, to give it that odour for which it is  peculiar, which renders it valuable for book-binding, on account of  preventing it from being attacked by insects. _Tawed_ leather, used for  gloves, is made by impregnating the skin with a liquor containing alum  and salt, and afterwards washed in a mixture of yolks of eggs and water;  the saline and animal matters combine, and give it that peculiar  softness, and such leather is afterwards coloured as may be required;  having been rolled over wooden rollers, in which are grooves, it is  called _Morocco_ leather. These are the principal varieties of leather  employed in this country.--_Brande's Lectures--Lancet_.      _Mites_.    An indefatigable naturalist has undertaken the very difficult task  of arranging the family of _acarides_, or mites; he divides them into  sixty-nine genera, the greater part of them new!      _Electro-Attraction of Leaves_.    The results of a French experimentalist have lately led him to conclude  that the leaves, hairs, and thorns of plants tend to maintain in them  the requisite proportion of electricity; and, by drawing off from the  atmosphere what is superabundant, they also act in some measure as  thunder-rods.      _Enormous Whale_.    The skeleton of a whale, 95 feet long by 18 feet high, has lately been  deposited in the Cabinet of Natural History at Ghent. In the opinion of  many naturalists, among whom is M. Cuvier, this fish could not have been  less than 900 or 1,000 years old!      _Fly in Wheat_.    In North America, much damage is done to crops of wheat by the Hessian  fly. The female deposits from one to eight or more eggs upon a single  plant of wheat, between the vagina or sheath of the inner leaf and the  culm nearest the roots; in which situation, with its head towards the  root or first joint, the young larva pass the winter. They eat the stem,  which thus becomes weak, and breaks; but are checked by another insect,  called the destructor, otherwise whole crops of wheat would be  annihilated.      _Spiders_.    A correspondent of London's _Magazine of Natural History_ says, that he  lately amused himself for more than an hour in observing the proceedings  of a little spider, whose bag of eggs had been removed and restored!      _Light of the Sea_.    Its appearance previous to a storm is a very old observation among  sailors. It is, however without foundation, as it is to be seen, more  or less, all the year round in the Carribean sea, where there are no  storms but in the hurricane months. In the hand it has a kind of mucous  feel.--_Mag. Nat. Hist_.      _Woodpeckers_.    A specimen of the _least woodpecker_ was lately shot near Newcastle; and  another has since been heard and seen near Coventry. Its noise resembles  that made by the boring of a large auger through the hardest wood; whence  the country people sometimes call the bird \"the pump-borer.\"--_Ibid_.      _The Tea Shrub_    Has been naturalized in Java with complete success; so that, sooner or  later, the Chinese monopoly will come to an end.      _Floating Island_.    From the earliest times, there are to be found in authors, notices of the  singular geological phenomena of floating islands. Pliny tells us of the  floating islands of the Lago de Bassanello, near Rome; in Loch Lomond, in  Scotland, there is or was a floating island; and in the Lake of Derwent  Water, in Cumberland, such islands appear and disappear at indefinite  periods. Mr. A. Pettingal, jun. has recently described a floating island,  about a mile southwards of Newbury port, 140 poles in length, and 120 in  breadth. It is covered with trees; and in summer, when dry weather is  long continued, it descends to the bottom of the lake.--_American,  Journal of Science_.      _An immense Medusa_.    A species of sea-serpent, was thrown on shore near Bombay, in 1819.  It was about 40 feet long, and must have weighed many tons. A violent  gale of wind threw it high above the reach of ordinary tides; in which  situation it took nine months to rot; during which process travellers  were obliged to change the direction of the road for nearly a quarter of  a mile, to avoid the offensive effluvia. It rotted so completely, that  not a vestige of bone remained.--(_C. Telfair, Esq. to R. Barclay, Esq.  of Bury Hill._)      _Himalaya Mountains_.    Captain Gerard, in exploring these mountains, with a view to measurement,  had ascended to the height of 19,600 feet, being 400 feet higher than  Humboldt had ascended on the Andes. The latter part of Captain Gerard's  ascent, for about two miles, was on an inclined plane of 42 deg., a nearer  approach to the perpendicular than Humboldt conceived it possible to  climb for any distance together.--_Heber's India_.      _Hippopotamus_.    The head of a Hippopotamus has recently been brought to England, with  all the flesh about it, in a high state of preservation. This amphibious  animal was harpooned while in combat with a crocodile, in a lake in  the interior of Africa. The head measures near four feet long, and  eight feet in circumference; the jaws open two feet wide, and the  cutting-teeth of which it has four in each jaw, are above a foot  long, and four inches in circumference. Its ears are not bigger than  a terrier's, and are much about the same shape. This formidable and  terrific creature, when full-grown, measures about 17 feet long from the  extremity of the snout to the insertion of the tail, above 16 feet in  circumference round the body, and stands above 7 feet high. It runs with  astonishing swiftness for its great bulk, at the bottom of lakes and  rivers, but not with as much ease on land. When excited, it puts forth  its full strength, which is prodigious. \"I have seen,\" says a mariner,  as we find it in Dampier, \"one of these animals open its jaws, and  seizing a boat between its teeth, at once bite and sink it to the  bottom. I have seen it on another occasion place itself under one of our  boats, and rising under it, overset it, with six men who were in it, but  who, however, happily received no other injury.\" At one time it was not  uncommon in the Nile, but now it is no where to be found in that river,  except above the cataracts.           *       *       *       *       *          THE COSMOPOLITE.    A CHAPTER OF BULLS.      I confess it is what the English call _a bull_, in the expression,    though the sense be manifest enough.--POPE.      We are friends to the exposition of the weak sides of great men, inasmuch  as it reads them a valuable lesson on their own infallibility, and tends  to lower the molehills of conceit that are raised in the world as  stumbling-blocks along every road of petty ambition. It would, however,  be but a sorry toil for the most cynical critic to illustrate these  vagaries otherwise than so many slips and trippings of the tongue and pen,  to which all men are liable in their unguarded moments--from Homer to  Anacreon Moore, or Demosthenes to Mr. Brougham. Our course is rather that  of a good-humoured _expose_, the worst effect of which will be to raise a  laugh at the expense of poor humanity, or a merited smile at our own  dulness and mistaken sense of the ridiculous.
