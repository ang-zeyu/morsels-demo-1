Almost every tavern of note about town hath or had its club. The Mermaid  Tavern is immortalized as the house resorted to by Shakspeare, Jonson,  Fletcher, and Beaumont; the Devil--which, Pennant informs us, stood on  the site of Child's-place, Temple Bar--was the scene of many a merry  meeting of the choice spirits in old days; at Will's Coffee-house, in  the Augustan age of English literature, societies were held to which  Steele, and Pope, and Addison belonged; Doctor Johnson, Hawkesworth, the  elder Salter, and Sir John Hawkins, were members of a club formerly held  at the King's-head, in Ivy-lane; the notorious Dick England, Dennis  O'Kelly, and Hull, with their associates, had, many years ago, a  sporting-club at Munday's Coffee-house; the Three Jolly Pigeons, in  Butcher-hall-lane, was formerly the gathering place of a set of old  school bibliopoles, who styled themselves the Free and Easy Counsellors  under the Cauliflower; stay-maker Hugh Kelly, Goldsmith, Ossian  Macpherson, Garrick, Cumberland, and the Woodfalls, with several noted  men of that day, were concerned in a club at the St. James's  Coffee-house; the Kit-Cat, which took its name from one Christopher Cat,  a pastry-cook, was held at a tavern in King-street, Westminster;  Button's--but truly the task of enumerating the several clubs, of which  we find notices \"in the books,\" as the lawyers have it, would be  endless.--_Every Night Book_.      CONVERSATION OF WOMEN.      The usual conversation of ordinary women very much cherishes the natural  weakness of being taken with outside appearance. Talk of a new-married  couple, and you immediately hear whether they keep their coach-and-six,  or eat in plate. Mention the name of an absent lady, and it is ten to  one but you learn something of her gown and petticoat. A ball is a great  help to discourse, and a birthday furnishes conversation for a  twelvemonth after. A furbelow of precious stones, a hat buttoned with a  diamond, a brocade waistcoat or petticoat, are standing topics.  --_Addison_.      BILDERDYK.      William Bilderdyk, admired as the first poet that modern Holland has  produced, and not less distinguished by the brilliant qualities of his  mind, did not, in his youth, seem to show any happy disposition for  study. His father, who formed an unfavourable opinion of his talents,  was much distressed, and frequently reproached him in severe terms for  his inattention and idleness, to which young Bilderdyk did not appear to  pay much attention. In 1776, the father, with a newspaper in his hand,  came to stimulate him, by showing the advertisement of a prize offered  by the Society of Leyden, and decreed to the author of a piece of  poetry, signed with these words, \"An Author 18 years old,\" who was  invited to make himself known. \"You ought to blush, idler,\" said old  Bilderdyk to his son. \"Here is a boy only of your age, and though so  young, is the pride and happiness of his parents; and you----.\" \"It is  myself,\" answered young William, throwing himself into his  father's arms.      SIR ANTHONY CARLISLE,      Who has often filled the anatomical chair at the Royal Academy, is no  less abstruse and instructive than pleasant and amusing. His  illustrative anecdotes are always excellent, and his way of telling them  quite dramatic. We have found him even more agreeable as a private  talker than as a lecturer; he is rich in the old lore of England--he  will hunt a phrase through several reigns--propose derivations for words  which are equally ingenious and learned--follow a proverb for  generations back, and discuss on the origin of language as though he had  never studied aught beside: he knows more than any other person we ever  met with of the biography of talented individuals--in the philosophy of  common life he is quite an adept--a capital chronologist--a man of fine  mind and most excellent memory: his experience has, of course, been very  great, and he has taken good advantage of it. We remember he once amused  us for half a day by adducing instances of men who, although possessed  of mean talents, had enabled themselves to effect wonders, by simply  hoarding in their minds, and subsequently acting upon, an immense number  of facts: from this subject we naturally enough fell into a discourse on  the importance, in many cases and situations, of attending to trifles.  As a proof of this, he mentioned a circumstance which occurred to an  eminent surgeon within his own memory; it was as follows: A gentleman,  residing about a post-stage from town, met with an accident which  eventually rendered amputation of a limb indispensable. The surgeon  alluded to was requested to perform the operation, and went from town  with two pupils to the gentleman's house, on the day appointed, for that  purpose. The usual preliminaries being arranged, he proceeded to  operate; the tourniquet was applied, the flesh divided, and the bone  laid bare, when, to his astonishment and horror, he discovered that his  instrument-case was without the saw! Here was a situation! Luckily his  presence of mind did not forsake him. Without apprising his patient of  the terrible fact, he put one of his pupils into his carriage, and told  the coachman to gallop to town. It was an hour and a half before the saw  was obtained, and during all that time the patient lay suffering. The  agony of the operator, though great, was scarcely a sufficient  punishment for his neglect in not seeing that all his instruments were  in the case before he started.    Basil Montagu, the water drinking barrister, who was present during the  narration of this anecdote, and the previous discussion, mentioned  another instance of the propriety of noticing those minor circumstances  in life, which are usually suffered to pass unheeded by people in  general. A man of talent was introduced into a company of strangers; he  scarcely spoke after his first salutation until he wished the party good  night. Almost every one dubbed him a fool; the lady hostess, who, be it  remarked, had not been previously informed of the abilities of her new  guest, was of a different opinion, \"I am sure,\" said she, \"that you are  all wrong; for, though he said nothing, I remarked that _he always  laughed in the right place_.\"--_Every Night Book_.           *       *       *       *       *      A FACT.          Pat went to his mistress: \"My lady, your mare      _In harness_, goes well as a dray-horse, I swear:      I tried, as you're thinking to sell her, or let her,      For _coming on_ thus, she'll _go off_ all the better.\"        \"Twas very well thought of\" the lady replied,      \"You've acted a sensible part.      But Patrick, pray tell me the day that you tried,      Of whom did you borrow the cart?\"        \"The _cart_? why, she _walk'd_ well _in harness_, I saw,      But I thought not, by no _manes_, to try if she'd _draw_;      For says I, by Saint Patrick, who, her comes to view,      To tell him, she has been 'in harness' will do!\"    M.L.B.           *       *       *       *       *        THE MONTHS.    AUGUST.      [Illustration]                                 All around      The yellow sheaves, catching the burning beam,      Glow, golden lustre.    MRS. ROBINSON.      This is the month of harvest. The crops usually begin with rye and oats,  proceed with wheat, and finish with pease and beans. Harvest-home is  still the greatest rural holiday in England, because it concludes at  once the most laborious and most lucrative of the farmer's employments,  and unites repose and profit. Thank heaven, there are, and must be,  seasons of some repose in agricultural employments, or the countryman  would work with as unceasing a madness, and contrive to be almost as  diseased and unhealthy as the citizen. But here again, and for the  reasons already mentioned, our holiday-making is not what it was. Our  ancestors used to burst into an enthusiasm of joy at the end of harvest,  and even mingled their previous labour with considerable merry-making,  in which they imitated the equality of the earlier ages. They crowned  the wheat-sheaves with flowers, they sung, they shouted, they danced,  they invited each other, or met to feast as at Christmas, in the halls  of rich houses; and, what was a very amiable custom, and wise beyond the  commoner wisdom that may seem to lie on the top of it, every one that  had been concerned, man, woman, and child, received a little present,  ribbons, laces, or sweetmeats.    The number of flowers is now sensibly diminished. Those that flower  newly are nigella, zinnias, polyanthuses, love-apples, mignonette,  capsicums, Michaelmas daisies, auriculus, asters or stars, and  China-asters. The additional trees and shrubs in flower are the  tamarisk, altheas, Venetian sumach, pomegranates, the beautiful  passion-flower, the trumpet flower, and the virgin's bower or clematis,  which is such a quick and handsome climber. But the quantity of fruit is  considerably multiplied, especially that of pears, peaches, apricots,  and grapes. And if the little delicate white flowers have at last  withdrawn from the hot sun, the wastes, marshes, and woods are dressed  in the luxuriant attire of ferns and heaths, with all their varieties of  green, purple, and gold. A piece of waste land, especially where the  ground is broken up into little inequalities, as Hampstead-heath, for  instance, is now a most bright as well as picturesque object; all the  ground, which is in light, giving the sun, as it were, gold for gold.  Mignonette, intended to flower in winter, should now be planted in pots,  and have the benefit of a warm situation. Seedlings in pots should have  the morning sunshine, and annuals in pots be frequently watered.    In the middle of this month, the young goldfinch broods appear,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9925"],[0,"Black Jack (#4)"],[1,"he thinks himself to  be that counts. And now, Vance, admit that your theory is exploded.\"    He shook his head.    \"Terry will do well enough. But wait till the pinch comes. You don't know  how he'll turn out when the rub comes. _Then_ blood will tell!\"    She shrugged her shoulders angrily.    \"You're simply being perverse now, Vance. At any rate, that picture is  one of Terry's old 'ancestors,' Colonel Vincent Colby, of prewar days.  Terry has discovered family resemblances, of course--same black hair,  same black eyes, and a great many other things.\"    \"But suppose he should ever learn the truth?\" murmured Vance.    She caught her breath.    \"That would be ruinous, of course. But he'll never learn. Only you and I  know.\"    \"A very hard blow, eh,\" said Vance, \"if he were robbed of the Colby  illusion and had Black Jack put in its place as a cold fact? But of  course we'll never tell him.\"    Her color was never high. Now it became gray. Only her eyes remained  burning, vivid, young, blazing out through the mask of age.    \"Remember you said his blood would tell before he was twenty-five; that  the blood of Black Jack would come to the surface; that he would have  shot a man?\"    \"Still harping on that, Elizabeth? What if he does?\"    \"I'd disown him, throw him out penniless on the world, never see him  again.\"    \"You're a Spartan,\" said her brother in awe, as he looked on that thin,  stern face. \"Terry is your theory. If he disappoints you, he'll be simply  a theory gone wrong. You'll cut him out of your life as if he were an  algebraic equation and never think of him again.\"    \"But he's not going wrong, Vance. Because, in ten days, he'll be twenty-  five! And that's what all these changes mean. The moment it grows dark on  the night of his twenty-fifth birthday, I'm going to take him into my  father's room and turn it over to him.\"    He had listened to her patiently, a little wearied by her unusual flow of  words. Now he came out of his apathy with a jerk. He laid his hand on  Elizabeth's shoulder and turned her so that the light shone full in her  face. Then he studied her.    \"What do you mean by that, Elizabeth?\"    \"Vance,\" she said steadily, but with a touch of pity in her voice, \"I  have waited for a score of years, hoping that you'd settle down and try  to do a man's work either here or somewhere else. You haven't done it.  Yesterday Mr. Cornwall came here to draw up my will. By that will I leave  you an annuity, Vance, that will take care of you in comfort; but I leave  everything else to Terry Colby. That's why I've changed the room. The  moment it grows dark ten days from today, I'm going to take Terry by the  hand and lead him into the room and into the position of my father!\"    The mask of youth which was Vance Cornish crumbled and fell away. A new  man looked down at her. The firm flesh of his face became loose. His  whole body was flabby. She had the feeling that if she pushed against his  chest with the weight of her arm, he would topple to the floor. That  weakness gradually passed. A peculiar strength of purpose grew in its  place.    \"Of course, this is a very shrewd game, Elizabeth. You want to wake me  up. You're using the spur to make me work. I don't blame you for using  the bluff, even if it's a rather cruel one. But, of course, it's  impossible for you to be serious in what you say.\"    \"Why impossible, Vance?\"    \"Because you know that I'm the last male representative of our family.  Because you know my father would turn in his grave if he knew that an  interloper, a foundling, the child of a murderer, a vagabond, had been  made the heir to his estate. But you aren't serious, Elizabeth; I  understand.\"    He swallowed his pride, for panic grew in him in proportion to the length  of time she maintained her silence.    \"As a matter of fact, I don't blame you for giving me a scare, my dear  sister. I have been a shameless loafer. I'm going to reform and lift the  burden of business off your shoulders--let you rest the remainder of your  life.\"    It was the worst thing he could have said. He realized it the moment he  had spoken. This forced, cowardly surrender was worse than brazen  defiance, and he saw her lip curl. An idler is apt to be like a sullen  child, except that in a grown man the child's sulky spite becomes a dark  malice, all-embracing. For the very reason that Vance knew he was  receiving what he deserved, and that this was the just reward for his  thriftless years of idleness, he began to hate Elizabeth with a cold,  quiet hatred. There is something stimulating about any great passion. Now  Vance felt his nerves soothed and calmed. His self-possession returned  with a rush. He was suddenly able to smile into her face.    \"After all,\" he said, \"you're absolutely right. I've been a failure,  Elizabeth--a rank, disheartening failure. You'd be foolish to trust the  result of your life labors in my hands--entirely foolish. I admit that  it's a shrewd blow to see the estate go to--Terry.\"    He found it oddly difficult to name the boy.    \"But why not? Why not Terry? He's a clean youngster, and he may turn out  very well--in spite of his blood. I hope so. The Lord knows you've given  him every chance and the best start in the world. I wish him luck!\"    He reached out his hand, and her bloodless fingers closed strongly over  it.    \"There's the old Vance talking,\" she said warmly, a mist across her eyes.  \"I almost thought that part of you had died.\"    He writhed inwardly. \"By Jove, Elizabeth, think of that boy, coming out  of nothing, everything poured into his hands--and now within ten days of  his goal! Rather exciting, isn't it? Suppose he should stumble at the  very threshold of his success? Eh?\"    He pressed the point with singular insistence.    \"Doesn't it make your heart beat, Elizabeth, when you think that he might  fall--that he might do what I prophesied so long ago--shoot a man before  he's twenty-five?\"    She shrugged the supposition calmly away.    \"My faith in him is based as strongly as the rocks, Vance. But if he  fell, after the schooling I've given him, I'd throw him out of my life--  forever.\"    He paused a moment, studying her face with a peculiar eagerness. Then he  shrugged in turn. \"Tush! Of course, that's impossible. Let's go down.\"        CHAPTER 4      When they reached the front porch, they saw Terence Colby coming up the  terrace from the river road on Le Sangre. And a changed horse he was. One  ear was forward as if he did not know what lay in store for him, but  would try to be on the alert. One ear flagged warily back. He went  slowly, lifting his feet with the care of a very weary horse. Yet, when  the wind fluttered a gust of whirling leaves beside him, he leaped aside  and stood with high head, staring, transformed in the instant into a  creature of fire and wire-strung nerves. The rider gave to the side-  spring with supple grace and then sent the stallion on up the hill.    Joyous triumph was in the face of Terry. His black hair was blowing about  his forehead, for his hat was pushed back after the manner of one who has  done a hard day's work and is ready to rest. He came close to the  veranda, and Le Sangre lifted his fine head and stared fearlessly,  curiously, with a sort of contemptuous pride, at Elizabeth and Vance.    \"The killer is no longer a killer,\" laughed Terry. \"Look him over, Uncle  Vance. A beauty, eh?\"    Elizabeth said nothing at all. But she rocked herself back and forth a  trifle in her chair as she nodded. She glanced over the terrace, hoping  that others might be there to see the triumph of her boy. Then she looked  back at Terence. But Vance was regarding the horse.    \"He might have a bit more in the legs, Terry.\"    \"Not much more. A leggy horse can't stand mountain work--or any other  work, for that matter, except a ride in the park.\"    \"I suppose you're right. He's a picture horse, Terry. And a devilish eye,  but I see that you've beaten him.\"    \"Beaten him?\" He shook his head. \"We reached a gentleman's agreement. As  long as I wear spurs, he'll fight me till he gets his teeth in me or  splashes my skull to bits with his heels. Otherwise he'll keep on  fighting till he drops. But as soon as I take off the spurs and stop  tormenting him, he'll do what I like. No whips or spurs for Le Sangre.  Eh, boy?\"    He held out the spurs so that the sun flashed on them. The horse  stiffened with a shudder, and that forward look of a horse about to bolt  came in his eyes.    \"No, no!\" cried Elizabeth.    But Terry laughed and dropped the spurs back in his pocket.    The stallion moved off, and Terry waved to them. Just as he turned, the  mind of Vance Cornish raced back to another picture--a man with long  black hair blowing about his face and a gun in either hand, sweeping  through a dusty street with shots barking behind him. It came suddenly as  a revelation, and left him downheaded with the thought.    \"What is it, Vance?\" asked his sister, reaching out to touch his arm.    \"Nothing.\" Then he added abruptly: \"I'm going for a jaunt for a few days,  Elizabeth.\"    She grew gloomy.    \"Are you going to insist on taking it to heart this way?\"    \"Not at all. I'm going to be back here in ten days and drink Terry's long  life and happiness across the birthday dinner table.\"    He marvelled at the ease with which he could make himself smile in her  face.    \"You noticed that--his gentleman's agreement with Le Sangre? I've made  him detest fighting with the idea that only brute beasts fight--men argue  and agree.\"    \"I've noticed that he never has trouble with the cow-punchers.\"    \"They've seen him box,\" chuckled Elizabeth. \"Besides, Terry isn't the  sort that troublemakers like to pick on. He has an ugly look when he's  angry.\"    \"H'm,\" murmured Vance. \"I've noticed that. But as long as he keeps to his  fists, he'll do no harm. But what is the reason for surrounding him with  guns, Elizabeth?\"    \"A very good "]]]
