At the end of the sterilizing period the jars are  removed, the covers completely tightened and the joints carefully  tested for leakage.    A thin or medium-thin sirup is best for pineapples. Measure the  blanching water and to every two cups of it add three cups of sugar.  If you wish the sirup thin heat until the sugar is dissolved. If  medium-thin sirup is desired, boil it about four minutes or until it  begins to be sirupy.      STEPS IN CANNING PINEAPPLE    1. Cut the pineapple into slices of desired thickness.    2. Pare the slices. It is easier to pare the slices than to pare the  whole pineapple.    3. Remove the eyes, using pineapple scissors to facilitate the work.    4. Blanch pineapple for five minutes in a small amount of boiling  water, using a wire basket or cheesecloth.    5. Cold-dip the pineapple.    6. Make a sirup, using the blanching water. Make a thin or medium-thin  sirup.    7. Pack the pineapple into hot sterilized jars, with good rubbers on  them.    8. Pour the sirup over the pineapple.    9. Put the tops of the jars on--not tight.    10. Sterilize for 30 minutes in hot-water-bath outfit, 30 minutes in  condensed-steam outfit, 25 minutes in water-seal outfit, 25 minutes in  steam pressure (5 pounds), 18 minutes in pressure cooker (10 pounds).    11. Remove from canner, tighten covers and inspect rubber and joints.      APPLES    Here are six ways in which canned apples may be used: as a breakfast  dish, with cream and sugar; baked like fresh apples; in apple salad,  often served for lunch or supper; as a relish with roast pork--the  apples may be fried in the pork fat or the cores may be cooked with  roast pork for flavoring; and for apple dumplings, deep apple pie and  other desserts in which whole apples are desirable. The sirup of  canned whole apples can be used for pudding sauces or fruit drinks.    Apples are another hard fruit which require blanching, as it greatly  improves their texture and appearance.    Apples and some other fruits, such as pears and quinces, have a  tendency to turn brown when allowed to stand after they are cut. To  prevent their discoloring the pieces may be dropped into mild salt  water as they are pared and sliced. Let them stand for five minutes,  then wash them in clear water and pack. Use a thin sirup for canning  apples.    Summer apples are not firm enough to keep well when canned. They cook  up and lose flavor. They may, however, be canned to be used in a short  time. Windfall apples may be pared, cored and sliced, using water, and  only a small quantity of that, instead of sirup, and canned for pies.    To be able to can windfall and cull apples and thus have them for home  use through the entire year is a great advantage to all farmers who  grow them. They can be sold on the market canned when they would not  bring a cent in the fresh state.    The windfall and cull apples may be divided into two grades. The  first grade would include the whole reasonably sound fruit; the second  grade the worm-eaten, partially decayed and injured fruit. Do not can  any injured or decayed part nor allow apples to become overripe before  canning.    Canning Whole Reasonably Firm Apples. Wash the apples. Remove cores  and blemishes. Place whole apples in blanching tray or blanching cloth  and blanch in boiling hot water for one or two minutes. Remove and  plunge quickly into cold water. Pack in large glass jars. Pour over  the product a hot thin sirup. Place rubber and top in position. Seal  partially--not tight.    Sterilize jars twenty minutes in hot-water-bath outfit and in  condensed steam, fifteen minutes in water-seal, ten minutes in  steam-pressure outfit with five pounds of steam pressure, five minutes  in aluminum pressure-cooker outfit, under ten pounds of steam  pressure. Remove jars, tighten covers, invert to cool and test joints.    Firm and tart apples may be cored and peeled first, then canned by the  above recipe.    Canning Apples for Pie Filling. Use second grade of windfalls or  culls. Wash, core, pare and remove all decayed spots. Slice apple  quickly into a basin containing slightly salted cold water--about one  tablespoon of salt per gallon--to prevent discoloring. Pack fresh cold  product in glass jars. Add one cupful of hot thin sirup to each quart  of fruit. Put on the rubbers and screw on tops, but do not seal  completely. Sterilize twelve minutes in hot-water bath or  condensed-steam outfit; ten minutes in water-seal outfit; six minutes  under five pounds of steam pressure; four minutes in aluminum  pressure cooker. Remove jars, tighten covers, invert to cool and test  joint. Store.    This filling can be used for making apple pies in the same way that  fresh apples would be used, with the exception that the sirup must be  poured off and less sugar should be used. Since the apples have  already been cooked, only enough heat is needed to cook the crust and  to warm the apples through. Pies may be baked in seven minutes. The  apple pies made with these apples are, in the opinion of many  housekeepers, as good as those made with fresh fruit, and they can be  made in less time and are less expensive.    The only difference between canning apples for pies and salads or  whole is that when wanted for pies the apples should be sliced  immediately after placing in cold slightly salted water.    Canning Quartered Apples for Fruit Salads. Select best-grade culls  of firm and rather tart varieties. Core, pare and quarter. Drop into  basin containing slightly salted cold water. Pack these quartered  pieces tightly in jars. Add a cup of hot thin sirup to each quart.  Place rubber and top in position, partially seal--not tight. Sterilize  twelve minutes in hot-water bath and condensed-steam outfits; ten  minutes in water-seal outfit; six minutes under five pounds of steam  pressure; four minutes in aluminum pressure cooker. Remove jars,  tighten covers, invert to cool and test joints. Store.      ORANGES    Canning Whole Oranges and Other Citrus Fruits. Select windfall or  packing-plant culls. Use no unsound or decayed fruit. Remove skin and  white fiber on surface. Blanch fruit in boiling water one and a half  minutes. Dip quickly in cold water. Pack containers full. Add boiling  hot thin sirup. Place rubber and cap in position and partially  seal--not tight.    Sterilize twelve minutes in hot-water-bath and condensed-steam  outfits; eight minutes in water-seal outfit; six minutes in  steam-pressure outfit under five pounds of steam; four minutes in  aluminum pressure-cooker outfit. Remove jars, tighten covers, invert  to cool and test joints. Wrap glass jars with paper to prevent  bleaching, and store.    Canning Sliced Oranges for Salad Purposes. The oranges may be  divided into their natural sections or sliced with a knife. Pack jars  or containers full. Pour over product hot thin sirup. Place rubber and  cap in position. Partially seal--not tight. Sterilize ten minutes in  hot-water-bath and condensed-steam outfits; six minutes in water-seal  outfit; five minutes in steam-pressure outfit with five pounds of  steam; four minutes in aluminum pressure-cooker outfit under ten  pounds of steam. Remove jars, tighten covers, invert to cool and test  the joints. Wrap jars with paper to prevent bleaching, and store.      PEARS, QUINCES AND RHUBARB    Pears are prepared and canned just as the whole firm apples are, being  blanched a minute and a half, cold-dipped and sterilized for the same  length of time as apples.    Quinces are so very hard they must be blanched like pineapples, but  for a longer time. Six minutes' blanching is usually sufficient for  quinces. The sterilizing period can be determined by looking at the  chart.    If skins are left on rhubarb it keeps its pink color. The hot dip is  not necessary and may be omitted. It removes some of the excessive  acid in the rhubarb which makes it objectionable to some people. Be  very careful not to hot-dip the rhubarb more than one minute, for it  gets mushy. An advantage of the hot dip is that more rhubarb can be  packed in a jar after it has been hot-dipped.      WHAT A BUSHEL OF FRUIT WILL YIELD    A great many women have no conception of how many jars of fruit they  will get from a bushel or half bushel of produce. It is wise to have a  little knowledge along this line, for it aids in planning the winter's  supply of canned goods as well as at marketing time.    From one bushel of the various fruits you will get on the average the  following:       PRODUCTS, 1 BUSHEL                 PINT JARS    QUART JARS      Windfall apples                         30         20      Standard peaches                        25         18      Pears                                   45         30      Plums                                   45         30      Berries                                 50         30      Windfall oranges--sliced                22         15      Windfall oranges--whole                 35         22      CANNING WITHOUT SUGAR    Though all instructions indicate that sugar is necessary for the  canning of all kinds of fruits, it is not necessary for their proper  sterilization and preservation. Any fruit may be successfully  sterilized by simply adding boiling water instead of the hot sirup. It  is a well-known fact, however, that most fruits canned in water will  not retain so well their natural flavor, texture and color as fruit  canned in sirup. When the product is to be used for pies, salads, and  so on it is not necessary to can in sirup. When fruits canned in water  are to be used for sauces, the products should be sweetened before  use. In many instances it requires more sugar to sweeten a sauce after  canning than it does when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13789"],[0,"Great Britain and the American Civil War (#5)"],[1," commercial  relations of the two nations--later to examine their political ideals.    In 1783 America won her independence in government from a colonial  status. But commercially she remained a British colony--yet with a  difference. She had formed a part of the British colonial system. All  her normal trade was with the mother country or with other British  colonies. Now her privileges in such trade were at an end, and she must  seek as a favour that which had formerly been hers as a member of the  British Empire. The direct trade between England and America was easily  and quickly resumed, for the commercial classes of both nations desired  it and profited by it. But the British colonial system prohibited trade  between a foreign state and British colonies and there was one channel  of trade, to and from the British West Indies, long very profitable to  both sides, during colonial times, but now legally hampered by American  independence. The New England States had lumber, fish, and farm products  desired by the West Indian planters, and these in turn offered needed  sugar, molasses, and rum. Both parties desired to restore the trade, and  in spite of the legal restrictions of the colonial system, the trade was  in fact resumed in part and either permitted or winked at by the British  Government, but never to the advantageous exchange of former times.    The acute stage of controversy over West Indian trade was not reached  until some thirty years after American Independence, but the uncertainty  of such trade during a long period in which a portion of it consisted  in unauthorized and unregulated exchange was a constant irritant to all  parties concerned. Meanwhile there came the War of 1812 with its  preliminary check upon direct trade to and from Great Britain, and its  final total prohibition of intercourse during the war itself. In 1800  the bulk of American importation of manufactures still came from Great  Britain. In the contest over neutral rights and theories, Jefferson  attempted to bring pressure on the belligerents, and especially on  England, by restriction of imports. First came a non-importation Act,  1806, followed by an embargo on exports, 1807, but these were so  unpopular in the commercial states of New England that they were  withdrawn in 1810, yet for a short time only, for Napoleon tricked the  United States into believing that France had yielded to American  contentions on neutral rights, and in 1811 non-intercourse was  proclaimed again with England alone. On June 18, 1812, America finally  declared war and trade stopped save in a few New England ports where  rebellious citizens continued to sell provisions to a blockading British  naval squadron.    For eight years after 1806, then, trade with Great Britain had steadily  decreased, finally almost to extinction during the war. But America  required certain articles customarily imported and necessity now forced  her to develop her own manufactures. New England had been the centre of  American foreign commerce, but now there began a trend toward  manufacturing enterprise. Even in 1814, however, at the end of the war,  it was still thought in the United States that under normal conditions  manufactured goods would again be imported and the general cry of  \"protection for home industries\" was as yet unvoiced. Nevertheless, a  group of infant industries had in fact been started and clamoured for  defence now that peace was restored. This situation was not unnoticed in  Great Britain where merchants, piling up goods in anticipation of peace  on the continent of Europe and a restored market, suddenly discovered  that the poverty of Europe denied them that market. Looking with  apprehension toward the new industries of America, British merchants,  following the advice of Lord Brougham in a parliamentary speech, dumped  great quantities of their surplus goods on the American market, selling  them far below cost, or even on extravagant credit terms. One object was  to smash the budding American manufactures.    This action of British merchants naturally stirred some angry patriotic  emotions in the circles where American business suffered and a demand  began to be heard for protection. But the Government of the United  States was still representative of agriculture, in the main, and while a  Tariff Bill was enacted in 1816 that Bill was regarded as a temporary  measure required by the necessity of paying the costs of the recent war.  Just at this juncture, however, British policy, now looking again toward  a great colonial empire, sought advantages for the hitherto neglected  maritime provinces of British North America, and thought that it had  found them by encouragement of their trade with the British West Indies.  The legal status of American trade with the West Indies was now enforced  and for a time intercourse was practically suspended.    This British policy brought to the front the issue of protection in  America. It not only worked against a return by New England from  manufacturing to commerce, but it soon brought into the ranks of  protectionists a northern and western agricultural element that had been  accustomed to sell surplus products to West Indian planters seeking  cheap food-stuffs for their slaves. This new protectionist element was  as yet not crystallized into a clamour for \"home markets\" for  agriculture, but the pressure of opinion was beginning to be felt, and  by 1820 the question of West Indian trade became one of constant  agitation and demanded political action. That action was taken on lines  of retaliation. Congress in 1818 passed a law excluding from American  ports any British vessel coming from a port access to which was denied  to an American vessel, and placing under bond in American ports British  vessels with prohibition of their proceeding to a British port to which  American vessels could not go. This act affected not merely direct trade  with the West Indies, but stopped the general custom of British ships of  taking part cargoes to Jamaica while _en route_ to and from the United  States. The result was, first, compromise, later, under Huskisson's  administration at the British Board of Trade, complete abandonment by  Britain of the exclusive trade basis of her whole colonial system.    The \"retaliatory system\" which J.Q. Adams regarded as \"a new declaration  of independence,\" was, in fact, quickly taken up by other non-colonial  nations, and these, with America, compelled Great Britain to take stock  of her interests. Huskisson, rightly foreseeing British prosperity as  dependent upon her manufactures and upon the carrying trade, stated in  Parliament that American \"retaliation\" had forced the issue. Freedom of  trade in British ports was offered in 1826 to all non-colonial nations  that would open their ports within one year on terms of equality to  British ships. J.Q. Adams, now President of the United States, delayed  acceptance of this offer, preferring a treaty negotiation, and was  rebuffed by Canning, so that actual resumption of West Indian trade did  not take place until 1830, after the close of Adams' administration.  That trade never recovered its former prosperity.    Meanwhile the long period of controversy, from 1806 to 1830, had  resulted in a complete change in the American situation. It is not a  sufficient explanation of the American belief in, and practice of, the  theory of protection to attribute this alone to British checks placed  upon free commercial rivalry. Nevertheless the progress of America  toward an established system, reaching its highest mark for years in the  Tariff Bill of 1828, is distinctly related to the events just narrated.  After American independence, the partially illegal status of West Indian  trade hampered commercial progress and slightly encouraged American  manufactures by the mere seeking of capital for investment; the neutral  troubles of 1806 and the American prohibitions on intercourse increased  the transfer of interest; the war of 1812 gave a complete protection to  infant industries; the dumping of British goods in 1815 stirred  patriotic American feeling; British renewal of colonial system  restrictions, and the twelve-year quarrel over \"retaliation\" gave time  for the definite establishment of protectionist ideas in the United  States. But Britain was soon proclaiming for herself and for the world  the common advantage and the justice of a great theory of free trade.  America was apparently now committed to an opposing economic theory, the  first great nation definitely to establish it, and thus there resulted a  clear-cut opposition of principle and a clash of interests. From 1846,  when free trade ideas triumphed in England, the devoted British free  trader regarded America as the chief obstacle to a world-wide acceptance  of his theory.    The one bright spot in America, as regarded by the British free trader,  was in the Southern States, where cotton interests, desiring no  advantage from protection, since their market was in Europe, attacked  American protection and sought to escape from it. Also slave supplies,  without protection, could have been purchased more cheaply from England  than from the manufacturing North. In 1833 indeed the South had forced a  reaction against protection, but it proceeded slowly. In 1854 it was  Southern opinion that carried through Congress the reciprocity treaty  with the British American Provinces, partly brought about, no doubt, by  a Southern fear that Canada, bitter over the loss of special advantages  in British markets by the British free trade of 1846, might join the  United States and thus swell the Northern and free states of the Union.  Cotton interests and trade became the dominant British commercial tie  with the United States, and the one great hope, to the British minds, of  a break in the false American system of protection.
