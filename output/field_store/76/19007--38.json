Thou to whom grace vouchsafes, or ere thy close  Of fleshly warfare, to behold the thrones  Of that eternal triumph, know to us  The light communicated, which through heaven  Expatiates without bound.  Therefore, if aught  Thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid,  Spare not; and of our radiance take thy fill.\"    Thus of those piteous spirits one bespake me;  And Beatrice next: \"Say on; and trust  As unto gods!\"--\"How in the light supreme  Thou harbour'st, and from thence the virtue bring'st,  That, sparkling in thine eyes, denotes thy joy,  I mark; but, who thou art, am still to seek;  Or wherefore, worthy spirit! for thy lot  This sphere assign'd, that oft from mortal ken  Is veil'd by others' beams.\"  I said, and turn'd  Toward the lustre, that with greeting, kind  Erewhile had hail'd me.  Forthwith brighter far  Than erst, it wax'd: and, as himself the sun  Hides through excess of light, when his warm gaze  Hath on the mantle of thick vapours prey'd;  Within its proper ray the saintly shape  Was, through increase of gladness, thus conceal'd;  And, shrouded so in splendour answer'd me,  E'en as the tenour of my song declares.          CANTO VI    \"After that Constantine the eagle turn'd  Against the motions of the heav'n, that roll'd  Consenting with its course, when he of yore,  Lavinia's spouse, was leader of the flight,  A hundred years twice told and more, his seat  At Europe's extreme point, the bird of Jove  Held, near the mountains, whence he issued first.  There, under shadow of his sacred plumes  Swaying the world, till through successive hands  To mine he came devolv'd.  Caesar I was,  And am Justinian; destin'd by the will  Of that prime love, whose influence I feel,  From vain excess to clear th' encumber'd laws.  Or ere that work engag'd me, I did hold  Christ's nature merely human, with such faith  Contented.  But the blessed Agapete,  Who was chief shepherd, he with warning voice  To the true faith recall'd me.  I believ'd  His words: and what he taught, now plainly see,  As thou in every contradiction seest  The true and false oppos'd.  Soon as my feet  Were to the church reclaim'd, to my great task,  By inspiration of God's grace impell'd,  I gave me wholly, and consign'd mine arms  To Belisarius, with whom heaven's right hand  Was link'd in such conjointment, 't was a sign  That I should rest.  To thy first question thus  I shape mine answer, which were ended here,  But that its tendency doth prompt perforce  To some addition; that thou well, mayst mark  What reason on each side they have to plead,  By whom that holiest banner is withstood,  Both who pretend its power and who oppose.    \"Beginning from that hour, when Pallas died  To give it rule, behold the valorous deeds  Have made it worthy reverence.  Not unknown  To thee, how for three hundred years and more  It dwelt in Alba, up to those fell lists  Where for its sake were met the rival three;  Nor aught unknown to thee, which it achiev'd  Down to the Sabines' wrong to Lucrece' woe,  With its sev'n kings conqu'ring the nation round;  Nor all it wrought, by Roman worthies home  'Gainst Brennus and th' Epirot prince, and hosts  Of single chiefs, or states in league combin'd  Of social warfare; hence Torquatus stern,  And Quintius nam'd of his neglected locks,  The Decii, and the Fabii hence acquir'd  Their fame, which I with duteous zeal embalm.  By it the pride of Arab hordes was quell'd,  When they led on by Hannibal o'erpass'd  The Alpine rocks, whence glide thy currents, Po!  Beneath its guidance, in their prime of days  Scipio and Pompey triumph'd; and that hill,  Under whose summit thou didst see the light,  Rued its stern bearing.  After, near the hour,  When heav'n was minded that o'er all the world  His own deep calm should brood, to Caesar's hand  Did Rome consign it; and what then it wrought  From Var unto the Rhine, saw Isere's flood,  Saw Loire and Seine, and every vale, that fills  The torrent Rhone.  What after that it wrought,  When from Ravenna it came forth, and leap'd  The Rubicon, was of so bold a flight,  That tongue nor pen may follow it.  Tow'rds Spain  It wheel'd its bands, then tow'rd Dyrrachium smote,  And on Pharsalia with so fierce a plunge,  E'en the warm Nile was conscious to the pang;  Its native shores Antandros, and the streams  Of Simois revisited, and there  Where Hector lies; then ill for Ptolemy  His pennons shook again; lightning thence fell  On Juba; and the next upon your west,  At sound of the Pompeian trump, return'd.    \"What following and in its next bearer's gripe  It wrought, is now by Cassius and Brutus  Bark'd off in hell, and by Perugia's sons  And Modena's was mourn'd.  Hence weepeth still  Sad Cleopatra, who, pursued by it,  Took from the adder black and sudden death.  With him it ran e'en to the Red Sea coast;  With him compos'd the world to such a peace,  That of his temple Janus barr'd the door.    \"But all the mighty standard yet had wrought,  And was appointed to perform thereafter,  Throughout the mortal kingdom which it sway'd,  Falls in appearance dwindled and obscur'd,  If one with steady eye and perfect thought  On the third Caesar look; for to his hands,  The living Justice, in whose breath I move,  Committed glory, e'en into his hands,  To execute the vengeance of its wrath.    \"Hear now and wonder at what next I tell.  After with Titus it was sent to wreak  Vengeance for vengeance of the ancient sin,  And, when the Lombard tooth, with fangs impure,  Did gore the bosom of the holy church,  Under its wings victorious, Charlemagne  Sped to her rescue.  Judge then for thyself  Of those, whom I erewhile accus'd to thee,  What they are, and how grievous their offending,  Who are the cause of all your ills.  The one  Against the universal ensign rears  The yellow lilies, and with partial aim  That to himself the other arrogates:  So that 't is hard to see which more offends.  Be yours, ye Ghibellines, to veil your arts  Beneath another standard: ill is this  Follow'd of him, who severs it and justice:  And let not with his Guelphs the new-crown'd Charles  Assail it, but those talons hold in dread,  Which from a lion of more lofty port  Have rent the easing.  Many a time ere now  The sons have for the sire's transgression wail'd;  Nor let him trust the fond belief, that heav'n  Will truck its armour for his lilied shield.    \"This little star is furnish'd with good spirits,  Whose mortal lives were busied to that end,  That honour and renown might wait on them:  And, when desires thus err in their intention,  True love must needs ascend with slacker beam.  But it is part of our delight, to measure  Our wages with the merit; and admire  The close proportion.  Hence doth heav'nly justice  Temper so evenly affection in us,  It ne'er can warp to any wrongfulness.  Of diverse voices is sweet music made:  So in our life the different degrees  Render sweet harmony among these wheels.    \"Within the pearl, that now encloseth us,  Shines Romeo's light, whose goodly deed and fair  Met ill acceptance.  But the Provencals,  That were his foes, have little cause for mirth.  Ill shapes that man his course, who makes his wrong  Of other's worth.  Four daughters were there born  To Raymond Berenger, and every one  Became a queen; and this for him did Romeo,  Though of mean state and from a foreign land.  Yet envious tongues incited him to ask  A reckoning of that just one, who return'd  Twelve fold to him for ten.  Aged and poor  He parted thence: and if the world did know  The heart he had, begging his life by morsels,  'T would deem the praise, it yields him, scantly dealt.\"          CANTO VII    \"Hosanna Sanctus Deus Sabaoth  Superillustrans claritate tua  Felices ignes horum malahoth!\"  Thus chanting saw I turn that substance bright  With fourfold lustre to its orb again,  Revolving; and the rest unto their dance  With it mov'd also; and like swiftest sparks,  In sudden distance from my sight were veil'd.    Me doubt possess'd, and \"Speak,\" it whisper'd me,  \"Speak, speak unto thy lady, that she quench  Thy thirst with drops of sweetness.\"  Yet blank awe,  Which lords it o'er me, even at the sound  Of Beatrice's name, did bow me down  As one in slumber held.  Not long that mood  Beatrice suffer'd: she, with such a smile,  As might have made one blest amid the flames,  Beaming upon me, thus her words began:  \"Thou in thy thought art pond'ring (as I deem),  And what I deem is truth how just revenge  Could be with justice punish'd: from which doubt  I soon will free thee; so thou mark my words;  For they of weighty matter shall possess thee.    \"That man, who was unborn, himself condemn'd,  And, in himself, all, who since him have liv'd,  His offspring: whence, below, the human kind  Lay sick in grievous error many an age;  Until it pleas'd the Word of God to come  Amongst them down, to his own person joining  The nature, from its Maker far estrang'd,  By the mere act of his eternal love.  Contemplate here the wonder I unfold.  The nature with its Maker thus conjoin'd,  Created first was blameless, pure and good;  But through itself alone was driven forth  From Paradise, because it had eschew'd  The way of truth and life, to evil turn'd.  Ne'er then was penalty so just as that  Inflicted by the cross, if thou regard  The nature in assumption doom'd: ne'er wrong  So great, in reference to him, who took  Such nature on him, and endur'd the doom.  God therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased:  So different effects flow'd from one act,  And heav'n was open'd, though the earth did quake.  Count it not hard henceforth, when thou dost hear  That a just vengeance was by righteous court  Justly reveng'd.  But yet I see thy mind  By thought on thought arising sore perplex'd,  And with how vehement desire it asks  Solution of the maze.

SONG OF THE BANNER AT DAYBREAK.        _Poet._    O a new song, a free song,    Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,    By the wind's voice and that of the drum,    By the banner's voice and child's voice and sea's voice and father's              voice,    Low on the ground and high in the air,    On the ground where father and child stand,    In the upward air where their eyes turn,    Where the banner at daybreak is flapping.      Words! bookwords! what are you?    Words no more, for hearken and see,    My song is there in the open air, and I must sing,    With the banner and pennant a-flapping.      I'll weave the chord and twine in,    Man's desire and babe's desire, I'll twine them in, I'll put in life,    I'll put the bayonet's flashing point, I'll let bullets and slugs              whizz,    (As one carrying a symbol and menace far into the future,    Crying with trumpet voice, _Arouse and beware! Beware and arouse!_)    I'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of              joy.    Then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,    With the banner and pennant a-flapping.      _Pennant._    Come up here, bard, bard,    Come up here, soul, soul,    Come up here, dear little child,    To fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with the measureless              light.      _Child._    Father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?    And what does it say to me all the while?      _Father._    Nothing my babe you see in the sky,    And nothing at all to you it says--but look you my babe,    Look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the              money-shops opening,    And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with              goods;    These, ah these, how valued and toil'd for these!    How envied by all the earth.      _Poet._    Fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high,    On floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels,    On floats the wind over the breast of the sea setting in toward land,    The great steady wind from west or west-by-south,    Floating so buoyant with milk-white foam on the waters.      But I am not the sea nor the red sun,    I am not the wind with girlish laughter,    Not the immense wind which strengthens, not the wind which lashes,    Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death,    But I am that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,    Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land,    Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings,    And the shore-sands know and the hissing wave, and that banner and              pennant,    Aloft there flapping and flapping.      _Child._    O father it is alive--it is full of people--it has children,    O now it seems to me it is talking to its children,    I hear it--it talks to me--O it is wonderful!    O it stretches--it spreads and runs so fast--O my father,    It is so broad it covers the whole sky.      _Father._    Cease, cease, my foolish babe,    What you are saying is sorrowful to me, much it displeases me;    Behold with the rest again I say, behold not banners and pennants              aloft,    But the well-prepared pavements behold, and mark the solid-wall'd              houses.      _Banner and Pennant._    Speak to the child O bard out of Manhattan,    To our children all, or north or south of Manhattan,    Point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all--and yet we know              not why,    For what are we, mere strips of cloth profiting nothing,    Only flapping in the wind?      _Poet._    I hear and see not strips of cloth alone,    I hear the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging sentry,    I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men, I hear Liberty!    I hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing,    I myself move abroad swift-rising flying then,    I use the wings of the land-bird and use the wings of the sea-bird,              and look down as from a height,    I do not deny the precious results of peace, I see populous cities              with wealth incalculable,    I see numberless farms, I see the farmers working in their fields or              barns,    I see mechanics working, I see buildings everywhere founded, going              up, or finished,    I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks drawn by              the locomotives,    I see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charleston, New              Orleans,    I see far in the West the immense area of grain, I dwell awhile              hovering,    I pass to the lumber forests of the North, and again to the Southern              plantation, and again to California;    Sweeping the whole I see the countless profit, the busy gatherings,              earn'd wages,    See the Identity formed out of thirty-eight spacious and haughty              States, (and many more to come,)    See forts on the shores of harbors, see ships sailing in and out;    Then over all, (aye! aye!) my little and lengthen'd pennant shaped              like a sword,    Runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance--and now the halyards              have rais'd it,    Side of my banner broad and blue, side of my starry banner,    Discarding peace over all the sea and land.      _Banner and Pennant._    Yet louder, higher, stronger, bard! yet farther, wider cleave!    No longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone,    We may be terror and carnage, and are so now,    Not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty States, (nor any              five, nor ten,)    Nor market nor depot we, nor money-bank in the city,    But these and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the mines              below, are ours,    And the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and small,    And the fields they moisten, and the crops and the fruits are ours,    Bays and channels and ships sailing in and out are ours--while we              over all,    Over the area spread below, the three or four millions of square              miles, the capitals,    The forty millions of people,--O bard! in life and death supreme,    We, even we, henceforth flaunt out masterful, high up above,    Not for the present alone, for a thousand years chanting through you,    This song to the soul of one poor little child.      _Child._    O my father I like not the houses,    They will never to me be any thing, nor do I like money,    But to mount up there I would like, O father dear, that banner I              like,    That pennant I would be and must be.      _Father._    Child of mine you fill me with anguish,    To be that pennant would be too fearful,    Little you know what it is this day, and after this day, forever,    It is to gain nothing, but risk and defy every thing,    Forward to stand in front of wars--and O, such wars!--what have you              to do with them?    With passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?      _Banner._    Demons and death then I sing,    Put in all, aye all will I, sword-shaped pennant for war,    And a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of              children,    Blent with the sounds of the peaceful land and the liquid wash of the              sea,    And the black ships fighting on the sea envelop'd in smoke,    And the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and              pines,    And the whirr of drums and the sound of soldiers marching, and the              hot sun shining south,    And the beach-waves combing over the beach on my Eastern shore, and              my Western shore the same,    And all between those shores, and my ever running Mississippi with              bends and chutes,    And my Illinois fields, and my Kansas fields, and my fields of              Missouri,    The Continent, devoting the whole identity without reserving an atom,    Pour in! whelm that which asks, which sings, with all and the yield              of all,    Fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole,    No more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,    But out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no more,    Croaking like crows here in the wind.      _Poet_.    My limbs, my veins dilate, my theme is clear at last,    Banner so broad advancing out of the night, I sing you haughty and              resolute,    I burst through where I waited long, too long, deafen'd and blinded,    My hearing and tongue are come to me, (a little child taught me,)    I hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and demand,    Insensate! insensate! (yet I at any rate chant you,) O banner!    Not houses of peace indeed are you, nor any nor all their prosperity,              (if need be, you shall again have every one of those houses              to destroy them,    You thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast, full              of comfort, built with money,    May they stand fast, then? not an hour except you above them and all              stand fast;)    O banner, not money so precious are you, not farm produce you, nor              the material good nutriment,    Nor excellent stores, nor"]]]
