I am  sure that the Colonel fully agreed with me that it was impolitic for Mr.  Wilson to become a delegate, but whether he actively opposed the plan I  do not know, although I believe that he did. It was some days before the  President announced that he would become the head of the American  Commission. I believe that he did this with grave doubts in his own mind  as to the wisdom of his decision, and I do not think that any new  arguments were advanced during those days which materially affected  his judgment.    This delay in reaching a final determination as to a course of action  was characteristic of Mr. Wilson. There is in his mentality a strange  mixture of positiveness and indecision which is almost paradoxical. It  is a peculiarity which it is hard to analyze and which has often been an  embarrassment in the conduct of public affairs. Suddenness rather than  promptness has always marked his decisions. Procrastination in  announcing a policy or a programme makes cooeperation difficult and not  infrequently defeats the desired purpose. To put off a decision to the  last moment is a trait of Mr. Wilson's character which has caused much  anxiety to those who, dealing with matters of vital importance, realized  that delay was perilous if not disastrous.    Of the consequences of the President's acting as one of his own  representatives to negotiate peace it is not my purpose to speak. The  events of the six months succeeding his decision to exercise in person  his constitutional right to conduct the foreign relations of the United  States are in a general way matters of common knowledge and furnish  sufficient data for the formulation of individual opinions without the  aid of argument or discussion. The important fact in connection with the  general topic being considered is the difference of opinion between the  President and myself as to the wisdom of his assuming the role of a  delegate. While I did not discuss the matter with him except at the  first when I opposed his attending the Peace Conference, I have little  doubt that Colonel House, if he urged the President to decline to sit as  a delegate, which I think may be presumed, or if he discussed it at all,  mentioned to him my opinion that such a step would be unwise. In any  event Mr. Wilson knew my views and that they were at variance with the  decision which he reached.          CHAPTER III    GENERAL PLAN FOR A LEAGUE OF NATIONS      It appears, from a general review of the situation prior and subsequent  to the assembling of the delegates to the Peace Conference, that  President Wilson's decision to go to Paris and to engage in person in  the negotiations was strongly influenced by his belief that it was the  only sure way of providing in the treaty of peace for the organization  of a League of Nations. While his presence in Paris was probably  affected to an extent by other considerations, as I have pointed out, it  is to be presumed that he was anxious to participate directly in the  drafting of the plan of organization of the League and to exert his  personal influence on the delegates in favor of its acceptance by  publicly addressing the Conference. This he could hardly have done  without becoming a delegate. It would seem, therefore, that the purpose  of creating a League of Nations and obtaining the incorporation of a  plan of organization in the treaty to be negotiated had much to do with  the President's presence at the peace table.    From the time that the United States entered the war in April, 1917, Mr.  Wilson held firmly to the idea that the salvation of the world from  imperialism would not be lasting unless provision was made in the peace  treaty for an international agency strong enough to prevent a future  attack upon the rights and liberties of the nations which were at so  great a cost holding in check the German armies and preventing them from  carrying out their evil designs of conquest. The object sought by the  United States in the war would not, in the views of many, be achieved  unless the world was organized to resist future aggression. The  essential thing, as the President saw it, in order to \"make the world  safe for democracy\" was to give permanency to the peace which would be  negotiated at the conclusion of the war. A union of the nations for the  purpose of preventing wars of aggression and conquest seemed to him the  most practical, if not the only, way of accomplishing this supreme  object, and he urged it with earnestness and eloquence in his public  addresses relating to the bases of peace.    There was much to be said in favor of the President's point of view.  Unquestionably the American people as a whole supported him in the  belief that there ought to be some international agreement, association,  or concord which would lessen the possibility of future wars. An  international organization to remove in a measure the immediate causes  of war, to provide means for the peaceable settlement of disputes  between nations, and to draw the governments into closer friendship  appealed to the general desire of the peoples of America and Europe. The  four years and more of horror and agony through which mankind had passed  must be made impossible of repetition, and there seemed no other way  than to form an international union devoted to the maintenance of peace  by composing, as far as possible, controversies which might ripen  into war.    For many years prior to 1914 an organization devoted to the prevention  of international wars had been discussed by those who gave thought to  warfare of the nations and who realized in a measure the precarious  state of international peace. The Hague Conventions of 1899 and of 1907  had been negotiated with that object, and it was only because of the  improper aspirations and hidden designs of certain powers, which were  represented at those great historic conferences, that the measures  adopted were not more expressive of the common desire of mankind and  more effective in securing the object sought. The Carnegie Endowment for  International Peace, the Ginn, now the World, Peace Foundation, and the  American Peace Society, and later the Society for the Judicial  Settlement of International Disputes, the League to Enforce Peace, and  many other organizations in America and in Europe were actively engaged  in considering ways and means to prevent war, to strengthen the bonds of  international good-will, and to insure the more general application of  the principles of justice to disputes between nations.    The outbreak of the war and the dreadful waste and suffering which  followed impelled the societies and associations then organized to  redoubled effort and induced the formation of new organizations. People  everywhere began to realize that their objects were real and not merely  sentimental or academic, that they were seeking practical means to  remove the conditions which had made the Great War possible. Public  opinion became more and more pronounced as the subject was more widely  discussed in the journals and periodicals of the day and at public  meetings, the divergence of views being chiefly in regard to the means  to be employed by the proposed organization and not as to the creation  of the organization, the necessity for which appeared to be  generally conceded.    With popular sentiment overwhelmingly in favor of some sort of world  union which would to an extent insure the nations against another  tragedy like the one which in November, 1918, had left the belligerents  wasted and exhausted and the whole world a prey to social and industrial  unrest, there was beyond question a demand that out of the great  international assembly at Paris there should come some common agency  devoted to the prevention of war. To ignore this all-prevalent sentiment  would have been to misrepresent the peoples of the civilized world and  would have aroused almost universal condemnation and protest. The  President was, therefore, entirely right in giving prominence to the  idea of an international union against war and in insisting that the  Peace Conference should make provision for the establishment of an  organization of the world with the prevention of future wars as its  central thought and purpose.    The great bulk of the American people, at the time that the President  left the United States to attend the Peace Conference, undoubtedly  believed that some sort of organization of this nature was necessary,  and I am convinced that the same popular belief prevailed in all other  civilized countries. It is possible that this assertion may seem too  emphatic to some who have opposed the plan for a League of Nations,  which appears in the first articles of the Treaty of Versailles, but, if  these opponents of the plan will go back to the time of which I am  writing, and avoid the impressions made upon them by subsequent events,  they will find, I believe, that even their own views have materially  changed since December, 1918. It is true that concrete plans had then  been suggested, but so far as the public knew the President had not  adopted any of them or formulated one of his own. He had not then  disclosed the provisions of his \"Covenant.\"    The mass of the people were only concerned with the general idea. There  was no well-defined opposition to that idea. At least it was not vocal.  Even the defeat of the Democratic Party in the Congressional elections  of November, 1918, could not be interpreted to be a repudiation of the  formation of a world organization. That election, by which both Houses  of Congress became Republican, was a popular rebuke to Mr. Wilson for  the partisanship shown in his letter of October addressed to the  American people, in which he practically asserted that it was  unpatriotic to support the Republican candidates.

Man is naturally the most awkward animal that inhales the breath of  life. There is nothing, however simple, which he can perform with the  smallest approach to gracefulness or ease. If he walks,--he hobbles, or  jumps, or limps, or trots, or sidles, or creeps--but creeping, sidling,  limping, hobbling, and jumping, are by no means walking. If he sits,--he  fidgets, twists his legs under his chair, throws his arm over the back  of it, and puts himself into a perspiration, by trying to be at ease. It  is the same in the more complicated operations of life. Behold that  individual on a horse! See with what persevering alacrity he hobbles up  and down from the croupe to the pommel, while his horse goes quietly at  an amble of from four to five miles in the hour. See how his knees,  flying like a weaver's shuttle, from one extremity of the saddle to  another, destroy, in a pleasure-ride from Edinburgh to Roslin, the good,  gray kerseymeres, which were glittering a day or two ago in Scaife and  Willis's shop. The horse begins to gallop--Bless our soul! the gentleman  will decidedly roll off. The reins were never intended to be pulled like  a peal of Bob Majors; your head, my friend ought to be on your own  shoulders, and not poking out between your charger's ears; and your  horse ought to use _its_ exertions to move on, and not you. It is a very  cold day, you have cantered your two miles, and now you are wiping your  brows, as if you had run the distance in half the time on foot.    People think it a mighty easy thing to roll along in a carriage. Step  into this noddy. That creature in the corner is evidently in a state of  such nervous excitement that his body is as immovable as if he had  breakfasted on the kitchen poker; every jolt of the vehicle must give  him a shake like a battering-ram; do you call this coming in to give  yourself a rest? Poor man, your ribs will ache for this for a month to  come! But the other gentleman opposite: see how flexible he has rendered  his body. Every time my venerable friend on the coach-box extends his  twig with a few yards of twine at the end of it, which he denominates \"a  whupp,\" the suddenness of the accelerated motion makes his great, round  head flop from the centre of his short, thick neck, and come with such  violence on the unstuffed back, that his hat is sent down upon the  bridge of his nose with a vehemence which might well nigh carry it away.  Do you say that man is capable of taking a _pleasure_ ride? Before he  has been bumped three miles, every pull of wind will be jerked out of  his body, and by the time he has arrived at Roslin, he will be a dead  man. If that man prospers in the world, he commits suicide the moment he  sets up his carriage.    We go to a ball. Mercy upon us! is this what you call dancing? A man of  thirty years of age, and with legs as thick as a gate-post, stands up in  the middle of the room, and gapes, and fumbles with his gloves, looking  all the time as if he were burying his grandmother. At a given signal,  the unwieldy animal puts himself in motion; he throws out his arms,  crouches up his shoulders, and, without moving a muscle of his face,  kicks out his legs, to the manifest risk of the bystanders, and goes  back to the place puffing and blowing like an otter, after a half-hour's  burst. Is this dancing? Shades of the filial and paternal Vestris! can  this be a specimen of the art which gives elasticity to the most inert  confirmation, which sets the blood glowing with a warm and genial flow,  and makes beauty float before our ravished senses, stealing our  admiration by the gracefulness of each new motion, till at last our  souls thrill to each warning movement, and dissolve into ecstasy and  love?    People seem even to labour to be awkward. One would think a gentleman  might shake hands with a familiar friend without any symptoms of  cubbishness. Not at all. The hand is jerked out by the one with the  velocity of a rocket, and comes so unexpectedly to the length of its  tether, that it nearly dislocates the shoulder bone. There it stands  swaying and clutching at the wind, at the full extent of the arm, while  the other is half poked out, and half drawn in, as if rheumatism  detained the upper moiety and only below the elbow were at liberty to  move. After you have shaken the hand, (but for what reason you squeeze  it, as if it were a sponge, I can by no means imagine,) can you not  withdraw it to your side, and keep it in the station where nature and  comfort alike tell you it ought to be? Do you think your breeches'  pocket the most proper place to push your daddle into? Do you put it  there to guard the solitary half-crown from the rapacity of your friend;  or do you put it across your breast in case of an unexpected winder from  your apparently peaceable acquaintance on the opposite side?    Is it not quite absurd that a man can't even take a glass of wine  without an appearance of infinite difficulty and pain? Eating an egg at  breakfast, we allow, is a difficult operation, but surely a glass of  wine after dinner should be as easy as it is undoubtedly agreeable. The  egg lies under many disadvantages. If you leave the egg-cup on the  table, you have to steady it with the one hand, and carry the floating  nutriment a distance of about two feet with the other, and always in a  confoundedly small spoon, and sometimes with rather unsteady fingers. To  avoid this, you take the egg-cup in your hand, and every spoonful have  to lay it down again,"]]]
