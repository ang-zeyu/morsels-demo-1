To return to the dairying.    Old and young alike we earned our scant livelihood by the heavy sweat of  our brows. Still, we _did_ gain an honest living. We were not ashamed to  look day in the face, and fought our way against all odds with the  stubborn independence of our British ancestors. But when 1894 went out  without rain, and '95, hot, dry, pitiless '95, succeeded it, there came  a time when it was impossible to make a living.    The scorching furnace-breath winds shrivelled every blade of grass, dust  and the moan of starving stock filled the air, vegetables became a thing  of the past. The calves I had reared died one by one, and the cows  followed in their footsteps.    I had left school then, and my mother and father and I spent the days in  lifting our cows. When our strength proved inadequate, the help of  neighbours had to be called in, and father would give his services in  return. Only a few of our more well-to-do neighbours had been able to  send their stock away, or had any better place to which to transfer  them. The majority of them were in as tight a plight as ourselves. This  cow-lifting became quite a trade, the whole day being spent in it and in  discussing the bad prospect ahead if the drought continued.    Many an extra line of care furrowed the brows of the disheartened  bushmen then. Not only was their living taken from them by the drought,  but there is nothing more heartrending than to have poor beasts,  especially dairy cows, so familiar, valued, and loved, pleading for food  day after day in their piteous dumb way when one has it not to give.    We shore ourselves of all but the bare necessaries of life, but even  they for a family of ten are considerable, and it was a mighty tussle to  get both ends within cover of meeting. We felt the full force of the  heavy hand of poverty--the most stinging kind of poverty too, that which  still holds up its head and keeps an outside appearance. Far more  grinding is this than the poverty inherited from generations which is  not ashamed of itself, and has not as an accompaniment the wounded pride  and humiliation which attacked us.    Some there are who argue that poverty does not mean unhappiness. Let  those try what it is to be destitute of even one companionable friend,  what it means to be forced to exist in an alien sphere of society, what  it is like to be unable to afford a stamp to write to a friend; let them  long as passionately as I have longed for reading and music, and be  unable to procure it because of poverty; let poverty force them into  doing work against which every fibre of their being revolts, as it has  forced me, and then see if their lives will be happy.    My school life had been dull and uneventful. The one incident of any  note had been the day that the teacher, better known as old Harris,  \"stood up\" to the inspector. The latter was a precise, collar-and-cuffs  sort of little man. He gave one the impression of having all his ideas  on the subjects he thought worthy of attention carefully culled and  packed in his brain-pan, and neatly labelled, so that he might without  fluster pounce upon any of them at a moment's warning. He was  gentlemanly and respectable, and discharged his duties punctiliously in  a manner reflecting credit on himself and his position, but, comparing  the mind of a philanthropist to the Murrumbidgee in breadth, his, in  comparison, might be likened to the flow of a bucket of water in a  dray-rut.    On the day in question--a precious hot one it was--he had finished  examining us in most subjects, and was looking at our copy-books. He  looked up from them, ahemed! and fastidiously straightened his  waistcoat.    \"Mr Harris!    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Comparisons are odious, but, unfortunately, I am forced to draw one  now.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"This writing is much inferior to that of town scholars. It is very  shaky and irregular. Also, I notice that the children seem stupid and  dull. I don't like putting it so plainly, but, in fact, ah, they seem to  be possessed with the proverbial stupidity of country people. How do you  account for this?\"    Poor old Harris! In spite of his drunken habits and inability to  properly discharge his duties, he had a warm heart and much fellowshiply  humanity in him. He understood and loved his pupils, and would not have  aspersions cast upon them. Besides, the nip he had taken to brace  himself to meet the inspector had been two or three, and they robbed him  of the discretion which otherwise might have kept him silent.    \"Si-r-r-r, I can and will account for it. Look you at every one of those  children. Every one, right down to this little tot,\" indicating a little  girl of five, \"has to milk and work hard before and after school,  besides walk on an average two miles to and from school in this infernal  heat. Most of the elder boys and girls milk on an average fourteen cows  morning and evening. You try that treatment for a week or two, my fine  gentleman, and then see if your fist doesn't ache and shake so that you  can't write at all. See if you won't look a trifle dozy. Stupidity of  country people be hanged! If you had to work from morning till night in  the heat and dust, and get precious little for it too, I bet you  wouldn't have much time to scrape your finger-nails, read science notes,  and look smart.\" Here he took off his coat and shaped up to his  superior.    The inspector drew back in consternation.    \"Mr Harris, you forget yourself!\"    At this juncture they went outside together. What happened there we  never knew. That is all we heard of the matter except the numerous  garbled accounts which were carried home that afternoon.      A DROUGHT IDYLL    \"Sybylla, what are you doing? Where is your mother?\"    \"I'm ironing. Mother's down at the fowl-house seeing after some  chickens. What do you want?\"    It was my father who addressed me. Time, 2 o'clock p.m. Thermometer hung  in the shade of the veranda registering 105 1/2 degrees.    \"I see Blackshaw coming across the flat. Call your mother. You bring the  leg-ropes--I've got the dog-leg. Come at once; we'll give the cows  another lift. Poor devils--might as well knock 'em on the head at once,  but there might be rain next moon. This drought can't last for ever.\"    I called mother, got the leg-ropes, and set off, pulling my sun-bonnet  closely over my face to protect my eyes from the dust which was driving  from the west in blinding clouds. The dog-leg to which father had  referred was three poles about eight or ten feet long, strapped together  so they could be stood up. It was an arrangement father had devised to  facilitate our labour in lifting the cows. A fourth and longer pole was  placed across the fork formed by the three, and to one end of this were  tied a couple of leg-ropes, after being placed round the beast, one  beneath the flank and one around the girth. On the other end of this  pole we would put our weight while one man would lift with the tail and  another with the horns. New-chum cows would sulk, and we would have  great work with them; but those used to the performance would help  themselves, and up they'd go as nice as a daisy. The only art needed was  to draw the pole back quickly before the cows could move, or the  leg-ropes would pull them over again.    On this afternoon we had six cows to lift. We struggled manfully, and  got five on their feet, and then proceeded to where the last one was  lying, back downwards, on a shadeless stony spot on the side of a hill.  The men slewed her round by the tail, while mother and I fixed the  dog-leg and adjusted the ropes. We got the cow up, but the poor beast  was so weak and knocked about that she immediately fell down again. We  resolved to let her have a few minutes' spell before making another  attempt at lifting. There was not a blade of grass to be seen, and the  ground was too dusty to sit on. We were too overdone to make more than  one-worded utterances, so waited silently in the blazing sun, closing  our eyes against the dust.    Weariness! Weariness!    A few light wind-smitten clouds made wan streaks across the white sky,  haggard with the fierce relentless glare of the afternoon sun. Weariness  was written across my mother's delicate careworn features, and found  expression in my father's knitted brows and dusty face. Blackshaw was  weary, and said so, as he wiped the dust, made mud with perspiration,  off his cheeks. I was weary--my limbs ached with the heat and work. The  poor beast stretched at our feet was weary. All nature was weary, and  seemed to sing a dirge to that effect in the furnace-breath wind which  roared among the trees on the low ranges at our back and smote the  parched and thirsty ground. All were weary, all but the sun. He seemed  to glory in his power, relentless and untiring, as he swung boldly in  the sky, triumphantly leering down upon his helpless victims.    Weariness! Weariness!    This was life--my life--my career, my brilliant career! I was  fifteen--fifteen! A few fleeting hours and I would be old as those  around me. I looked at them as they stood there, weary, and turning down  the other side of the hill of life. When young, no doubt they had hoped  for, and dreamed of, better things--had even known them. But here they  were. This had been their life; this was their career. It was, and in  all probability would be, mine too. My life--my career--my brilliant  career!    Weariness! Weariness!    The summer sun danced on. Summer is fiendish, and life is a curse, I  said in my heart. What a great dull hard rock the world was! On it were  a few barren narrow ledges, and on these, by exerting ourselves so that  the force wears off our finger-nails, it allows us to hang for a year or  two, and then hurls us off into outer darkness and oblivion, perhaps to  endure worse torture than this.    The poor beast "]]]
