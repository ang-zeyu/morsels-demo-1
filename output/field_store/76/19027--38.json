So to the sacred Sun in MEMNON's fane,       Spontaneous concords quired the matin strain;  185  --Touch'd by his orient beam, responsive rings       The living lyre, and vibrates all it's strings;       Accordant ailes the tender tones prolong,       And holy echoes swell the adoring song.      [_Confine with folds of air_. l. 176. The air, like all other bad  conductors of electricity, is known to be a bad conductor of heat; and  thence prevents the heat acquired from the sun's rays by the earth's  surface from being so soon dissipated, in the same manner as a blanket,  which may be considered as a sponge filled with air, prevents the escape  of heat from the person wrapped in it. This seems to be one cause of the  great degree of cold on the tops of mountains, where the rarity of the  air is greater, and it therefore becomes a better conductor both of heat  and electricity. See note on Barometz, Vol. II. of this work.    There is however another cause to which the great coldness of mountains  and of the higher regions of the atmosphere is more immediately to be  ascribed, explained by Dr. Darwin in the Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXVIII.  who has there proved by experiments with the air-gun and air-pump, that  when any portion of the atmosphere becomes mechanically expanded, it  absorbs heat from the bodies in its vicinity. And as the air which  creeps along the plains, expands itself by a part of the pressure being  taken off when it ascends the sides of mountains; it at the same time  attracts heat from the summits of those mountains, or other bodies which  happen to be immersed in it, and thus produces cold. Hence he concludes  that the hot air at the bottom of the Andes becomes temperate by its own  rarefaction when it ascends to the city of Quito; and by its further  rarefaction becomes cooled to the freezing point when it ascends to the  snowy regions on the summits of those mountains. To this also he  attributes the great degree of cold experienced by the aeronauts in  their balloons; and which produces hail in summer at the height of only  two or three miles in the atmosphere.]    [_Diffuse phosphoric light_. l. 177. I have often been induced to  believe from observation, that the twilight of the evenings is lighter  than that of the mornings at the same distance from noon. Some may  ascribe this to the greater height of the atmosphere in the evenings  having been rarefied by the sun during the day; but as its density must  at the same time be diminished, its power of refraction would continue  the same. I should rather suppose that it may be owing to the  phosphorescent quality (as it is called) of almost all bodies; that is,  when they have been exposed to the sun they continue to emit light for a  considerable time afterwards. This is generally believed to arise either  from such bodies giving out the light which they had previously  absorbed; or to the continuance of a slow combustion which the light  they had been previously exposed to had excited. See the next note.]    [_Beccari's shells_. l. 182. Beccari made many curious experiments on  the phosphoric light, as it is called, which becomes visible on bodies  brought into a dark room, after having been previously exposed to the  sunshine. It appears from these experiments, that almost all inflammable  bodies possess this quality in a greater or less degree; white paper or  linen thus examined after having been exposed to the sunshine, is  luminous to an extraordinary degree; and if a person shut up in a dark  room, puts one of his hands out into the sun's light for a short time  and then retracts it, he will be able to see that hand distinctly and  not the other. These experiments seem to countenance the idea of light  being absorbed and again emitted from bodies when they are removed into  darkness. But Beccari further pretended, that some calcareous  compositions when exposed to red, yellow, or blue light, through  coloured glasses, would on their being brought into a dark room emit  coloured lights. This mistaken fact of Beccari's, Mr. Wilson decidedly  refutes; and among many other curious experiments discovered, that if  oyster-shells were thrown into a common fire and calcined for about half  an hour, and then brought to a person who had previously been some  minutes in a dark room, that many of them would exhibit beautiful irises  of prismatic colours, from whence probably arose Beccari's mistake. Mr.  Wilson from hence contends, that these kinds of phosphori do not emit  the light they had previously received, but that they are set on fire by  the sun's rays, and continue for some time a slow combustion after they  are withdrawn from the light. Wilson's Experiments on Phosphori.  Dodsley, 1775.    The Bolognian stone is a selenite, or gypsum, and has been long  celebrated for its phosphorescent quality after having been burnt in a  sulphurous fire; and exposed when cold to the sun's light. It may be  thus well imitated: Calcine oyster-shells half an hour, pulverize them  when cold, and add one third part of flowers of sulphur, press them  close into a small crucible, and calcine them for an hour or longer, and  keep the powder in a phial close stopped. A part of this powder is to be  exposed for a minute or two to the sunbeams, and then brought into a  dark room. The calcined Bolognian stone becomes a calcareous hepar of  sulphur; but the calcined shells, as they contain the animal acid, may  also contain some of the phosphorus of Kunkel.]    [_In Memnon's fane_. l. 183.

[_The lamps nocturnal_. l. 189. The ignis fatuus or Jack a lantern,  frequently alluded to by poets, is supposed to originate from the  inflammable air, or Hydrogene, given up from morasses; which being of a  heavier kind from its impurity than that obtained from iron and water,  hovers near the surface of the earth, and uniting with common air gives  out light by its slow ignition. Perhaps such lights have no existence,  and the reflection of a star on watery ground may have deceived the  travellers, who have been said to be bewildered by them? if the fact was  established it would much contribute to explain the phenomena of  northern lights. I have travelled much in the night, in all seasons of  the year, and over all kinds of soil, but never saw one of these Will  o'wisps.]    [_Shine round Calendula_. l. 191. See note on Tropaeolum in Vol. II.]    [_The radiant Worm_. l. 193. See additional notes, No. IX.]    [_The dread Gymnotus_. l. 202. The Gymnotus electricus is a native of  the river of Surinam in South America; those which were brought over to  England about eight years ago were about three or four feet long, and  gave an electric shock (as I experienced) by putting one finger on the  back near its head, and another of the opposite hand into the water near  its tail. In their native country they are said to exceed twenty feet in  length, and kill any man who approaches them in an hostile manner. It is  not only to escape its enemies that this surprizing power of the fish is  used, but also to take its prey; which it does by benumbing them and  then devouring them before they have time to recover, or by perfectly  killing them; for the quantity of the power seemed to be determined by  the will or anger of the animal; as it sometimes struck a fish twice  before it was sufficiently benumbed to be easily swallowed.    The organs productive of this wonderful accumulation of electric matter  have been accurately dissected and described by Mr. J. Hunter. Philos.  Trans. Vol. LXV. And are so divided by membranes as to compose a very  extensive surface, and are supplied with many pairs of nerves larger  than any other nerves of the body; but how so large a quantity is so  quickly accumulated as to produce such amazing effects in a fluid ill  adapted for the purpose is not yet satisfactorily explained. The Torpedo  possesses a similar power in a less degree, as was shewn by Mr. Walch,  and another fish lately described by Mr. Paterson. Philo. Trans. Vol.  LXXVI.    In the construction of the Leyden-Phial, (as it is called) which is  coated on both sides, it is known, that above one hundred times the  quantity of positive electricity can be condensed on every square inch  of the coating on one side, than could have been accumulated on the same  surface if there had been no opposite coating communicating with the  earth; because the negative electricity, or that part of it which caused  its expansion, is now drawn off through the glass. It is also well  known, that the thinner the glass is (which is thus coated on both sides  so as to make a Leyden-phial, or plate) the more electricity can be  condensed on one of its surfaces, till it becomes so thin as to break,  and thence discharge itself.    Now it is possible, that the quantity of electricity condensible on one  side of a coated phial may increase in some high ratio "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9624"],[0,"Directions for Cookery, in its Various Branches (#4)"],[1,"the bones,  and one pound of ham in small slices. Add an onion minced, and  black pepper to your taste. Put only as much water as will cover  it, and stew it gently for an hour, keeping the pot closely  covered. Then skim it well, and pour in a quart of boiling water.  Add a head of celery cut into small pieces, and half a dozen  blades of mace. Boil it gently two hours and a half. Then put in a  quarter of a pound of butter, divided into small pieces and rolled  in flour, and half a pint of port or Madeira wine. Let it boil a  quarter of an hour longer, and then send it to table with the meat  in it.      HARE OR RABBIT SOUP.    Take a large newly killed hare, or two rabbits; cut them up and  wash the pieces. Save all the blood, (which adds much to the  flavour of the hare,) and strain it through a sieve. Put the  pieces into a soup-pot with four whole onions stuck with a few  cloves, four or five blades of mace, a head of celery cut small,  and a bunch of parsley with a large sprig of sweet marjoram and  one of sweet basil, all tied together. Salt and cayenne to your  taste. Pour in three quarts of water, and stew it gently an hour  and a half. Then put in the strained blood and simmer it for  another hour, at least. Do not let it actually boil, as that will  cause the blood to curdle. Then strain it, and pound half the meat  in a mortar, and stir it into the soup to thicken it, and cut the  remainder of the meat into small mouthfuls. Stir in, at the last,  a jill or two glasses of red wine, and a large table-spoonful of  currant jelly. Boil it slowly a few minutes longer, and then put  it into your tureen. It will be much improved by the addition of  about a dozen and a half small force-meat balls, about the size of  a nutmeg. This soup will require cooking at least four hours.    Partridge, pheasant, or grouse soup may be made in a similar  manner.    If you have any clear gravy soup, you may cut up the hare, season  it as above, and put it into a jug or jar well covered, and set in  boiling water till the meat is tender. Then put it into the gravy  soup, add the wine, and let it come to a boil. Send it to table  with the pieces of the hare in the soup.    When hare soup is made in this last manner, omit using the blood.      MULLAGATAWNY SOUP, AS MADE IN INDIA.    Take a quarter of an ounce of China turmeric, the third of an  ounce of cassia, three drachms of black pepper, two drachms of  cayenne pepper, and an ounce of coriander seeds. These must all be  pounded fine in a mortar, and well mixed and sifted. They will  make sufficient curry powder for the following quantity of soup:    Take two large fowls, or three pounds of the lean of veal. Cut the  flesh entirely from the bones in small pieces, and put it into a  stew-pan with two quarts of water. Let it boil slowly for half an  hour, skimming it well. Prepare four large onions, minced and  fried in two ounces of butter. Add to them the curry powder and  moisten the whole with broth from the stew-pan, mixed with a  little rice flour. When thoroughly mixed, stir the seasoning into  the soup, and simmer it till it is as smooth and thick as cream,  and till the chicken or veal is perfectly tender. Then stir into  it the juice of a lemon; and five minutes after take up the soup,  with the meat in it, and serve it in the tureen.    Send to table separately, boiled rice on a hot-water dish to keep  it warm, The rice is to be put into the plates of soup by those  who eat it.    To boil rice for this soup in the East India fashion:--Pick and  wash half a pound in warm water. Put it into a sauce-pan. Pour two  quarts of boiling water over it, and cover the pan closely. Set it  in a warm place by the fire, to cook gradually in the hot water.  In an hour pour off all the water, and setting the pan on hot  coals, stir up and toss the rice with a fork, so as to separate  the grains, and to dry without hardening it. Do not use a spoon,  as that will not loosen the grains sufficiently.      MOCK TURTLE OR CALF'S HEAD SOUP.    This soup will require eight hours to prepare. Take a large calf's  head, and having cleaned, washed, and soaked it, put it into a pot  with a knuckle of veal, and the hock of a ham, or a few slices of  bacon; but previously cut off and reserve enough of the veal to  make two dozen small force-meat balls. Put the head and the other  meat into as much water as will cover it very well, so that it may  not be necessary to replenish it: this soup being always made very  rich. Let it boil slowly four hours, skimming it carefully. As  soon as no more scum rises, put in six potatoes, and three  turnips, all sliced thin; with equal proportions of parsley, sweet  marjoram and sweet basil, chopped fine; and pepper and salt to  your taste.    An hour before you send the meat to table, make about two dozen  small force-meat balls of minced veal and beef-suet in equal  quantities, seasoned with pepper and salt; sweet herbs, grated  lemon-peel, and powdered nutmeg and mace. Add some beaten yolk of  egg to make all these ingredients stick together. Flour the balls  very well, and fry them in butter. Before you put them into the  soup, take out the head, and the other meat. Cut the meat from the  head in small pieces, and return it to the soup. When the soup is  nearly done, stir in half a pint of Madeira. Have ready at least a  dozen egg-balls made of the yolks of hard-boiled eggs, grated or  pounded in a mortar, and mixed with a little flour and sufficient  raw yolk of egg to bind them. Make them up into the form and size  of boy's marbles. Throw them into the soup at the last, and also  squeeze in the juice of a lemon. Let it get another slow boil, and  then put it into the tureen.    We omit a receipt for _real_ turtle soup, as when that very  expensive, complicated, and difficult dish is prepared in a  private family, it is advisable to hire a first-rate cook for the  express purpose.    An easy way is to get it ready made, in any quantity you please,  from a turtle-soup house.      OX TAIL SOUP    Three ox tails will make a large tureen full of soup. Desire the  butcher to divide them at the joints. Rub them with salt, and put  them to soak in warm water, while you prepare the vegetables. Put  into a large pot or stew-pan four onions peeled and quartered, a  bunch of parsley, two sliced carrots, two sliced turnips, and two  dozen pepper corns. Then put in the tails, and pour on three  quarts of water.    Cover the pot, and set it on hot coals by the side of the fire.  Keep it gently simmering for about three hours, supplying it well  with fresh hot coals. Skim it carefully. When the meat is quite  tender, and falls from the bones, strain the soup into another  pot, and add to it a spoonful of mushroom catchup, and two  spoonfuls of butter rubbed in flour.    You may thicken it also with the pulp of a dozen onions first  fried soft, and then rubbed through a cullender. After it is  thickened, let it just boil up, and then send it to table, with  small squares of toasted bread in the tureen.      OCHRA SOUP.    Take a large slice of ham (cold boiled ham is best) and two pounds  of the lean of fresh beef; cut all the meat into small pieces. Add  a quarter of a pound of butter slightly melted; twelve large  tomatas pared and cut small; five dozen ochras cut into slices not  thicker than a cent; and salt and cayenne pepper to your taste.  Put all these ingredients into a pot; cover them with boiling  water, and let them stew slowly for an hour. Then add three quarts  of _hot_ water, and increase the heat so as to make the soup  boil. Skim it well, and stir it frequently with a wooden or silver  spoon.    Boil it till the tomatas are all to pieces, and the ochras  entirely dissolved. Strain it, and then serve it up with toasted  bread cut into dice, put in after it comes out of the pot.    This soup will be improved by a pint of shelled Lima beans, boiled  by themselves, and put into the tureen just before you send it to  table.      BEAN SOUP.    Put two quarts of dried white beans into soak the night before you  make the soup, which should be put on as early in the day as  possible.    Take five pounds of the lean of fresh beef--the coarse pieces will  do. Cut them up, and put them into your soup-pot with the bones  belonging to them, (which should be broken to pieces,) and a pound  of bacon cut very small. If you have the remains of a piece of  beef that has been roasted the day before, and so much under-done  that the juices remain in it, you may put it into the pot, and its  bones along with it. Season the meat with pepper and salt, and  pour on it six quarts of water. As soon as it boils take off the  scum, and put in the beans (having first drained them) and a head  of celery cut small, or a table-spoonful of pounded celery-seed.  Boil it slowly till the meat is done to shreds, and the beans all  dissolved. Then strain it through a cullender into the tureen, and  put into it small squares of toasted bread with the crust cut off.    Some prefer it with the beans boiled soft, but not quite  dissolved. In this case, do not strain it; but take out the meat  and bones with a fork before you send it to table.      PEAS SOUP.    Soak two quarts of dried or split peas overnight. In the morning  take three pounds of the lean of fresh beef, and a pound of bacon  or pickled pork. Cut them into pieces, and put them into a large  soup-pot with the peas, (which must first be well drained,) and a  table-spoonful of dried mint rubbed to powder. Add five quarts of  water, and boil the soup gently for three hours, skimming it well,  and then put in four heads of celery cut small, or two table-spoonfuls  of pounded celery seed.    It must be boiled till the peas are entirely dissolved, so as to  be no longer distinguishable, and the celery quite soft. Then  strain it into a tureen, and serve it up with toasted bread cut in  dice. Omit the crust of the bread.    Stir"]]]
