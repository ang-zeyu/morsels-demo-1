One more  suggestion. The Secretary of State has the privilege of recommending  to the Crown members of the Council of India. I think that the time  has now come when the Secretary of State may safely, wisely, and  justly recommend at any rate one Indian member. I will not discuss the  question now. I may have to argue it in Parliament at a later stage,  but I think it is right to say what is my intention, realising as we  all do how few opportunities the governing bodies have of hearing the  voice of Indians.    I believe I have defended myself from ignoring the principle that  there is a difference between the Western European and the Indian  Asiatic. There is vital difference, and it is infatuation to ignore  it. But there is another vital fact--namely, that the Indian Asiatic  is a man with very vivid susceptibilities of all kinds, and with  living traditions of a civilisation of his own; and we are bound to  treat him with the same kind of respect and kindness and sympathy that  we should expect to be treated with ourselves. Only the other day I  saw a letter from General Gordon to a friend of mine. He wrote--        \"To govern men, there is but one way, and it is eternal truth. Get      into their skins. Try to realize their feelings. That is the true      secret of government.\"    That is not only a great ethical, but a great political law, and we  shall reap a sour and sorry harvest if it is forgotten. It would be  folly to pretend to any dogmatic assurance--and I certainly do not--as  to the course of the future in India. But for to-day anybody who takes  part in the rule of India, whether as a Minister or as a Member of  the House of Commons, participating in the discussion on affairs in  India--anyone who wants to take a fruitful part in such discussions,  if he does his duty will found himself on the assumption that the  British rule will continue, ought to continue, and must continue.  There is, I know, a school,--I do not think it has representatives in  this House--who say that we might wisely walk out of India, and that  the Indians would manage their own affairs better than we can manage  affairs for them. Anybody who pictures to himself the anarchy, the  bloody chaos, that would follow from any such deplorable step, must  shrink from that sinister decision. We, at all events--Ministers and  Members of this House--are bound to take a completely different view.  The Government, and the House in all its parties and groups, is  determined that we ought to face all these mischiefs and difficulties  and dangers of which I have been speaking with a clear purpose. We  know that we are not doing it for our own interest alone, or our own  fame in the history of the civilised world alone, but for the interest  of the millions committed to us. We ought to face it with sympathy,  with kindness, with firmness, with a love of justice, and, whether the  weather be fair or foul, in a valiant and manful spirit.          II      TO CONSTITUENTS    (ARBROATH. OCTOBER 21, 1907)    It is an enormous satisfaction to me to find myself here once more,  the first time since the polling, and since the splendid majority that  these burghs were good enough to give me. I value very much what the  Provost has said, when he told you that I have never, though I have  had pretty heavy burdens, neglected the local business of Arbroath and  the other burghs. The Provost truly said that I hold an important and  responsible office under the Crown; and I hope that fact will be the  excuse, if excuse be needed, for my confining myself to-night to a  single topic. When I spoke to a friend of mine in London the other day  he said, \"What are you going to speak about?\", and I told him. He is a  very experienced man and he said, \"It is a most unattractive subject,  India.\" At any rate, this is the last place where any apology is  needed for speaking about India, because it is you who are responsible  for my being the Indian Minister. If your 2,500 majority had been  2,500 the other way, I should have been no longer the Indian Minister.  There is something that strikes the imagination, something that  awakens a feeling of the bonds of mankind, in the thought that you  here and in the other burghs--(shipmen, artificers, craftsmen, and  shopkeepers living here)--are brought through me, and through your  responsibility in electing me, into contact with all these hundreds  of millions across the seas. Therefore it is that I will not make any  apology to you for my choice of a subject to-night. Let me say  this, not only to you gentlemen here, but to all British  constituencies--that it is well you should have patience enough to  listen to a speech about India; because it is no secret to anybody who  understands, that if the Government were to make a certain kind of bad  blunder in India--which I do not at all expect them to make--there  would be short work for a long time to come, with many of those  schemes, upon which you have set your heart. Do not dream, if any  mishap of a certain kind were to come to pass in India that you can  go on with that programme of social reforms, all costing money and  absorbing attention, in the spirit in which you are now about to  pursue it.    I am not particularly fond of talking of myself, but there is one  single personal word that I would like to say, and my constituency is  the only place in which I should not be ashamed to say that word. You,  after all, are concerned in the consistency of your representative.  Now I think a public man who spends overmuch time in vindicating  his consistency, makes a mistake. I will confess to you in friendly  confidence, that I have winced when I read of lifelong friends of  mine saying that I have, in certain Indian transactions, shelved the  principles of a lifetime. One of your countrymen said that, like the  Python--that fabulous animal who had the largest swallow that any  creature ever enjoyed--I have swallowed all my principles. I am a  little disappointed at such clatter as this. When a man has laboured  for more years than I care to count, for Liberal principles and  Liberal causes, and thinks he may possibly have accumulated a little  credit in the bank of public opinion--and in the opinion of his party  and his friends--it is a most extraordinary and unwelcome surprise to  him, when he draws a very small cheque indeed upon that capital, to  find the cheque returned with the uncomfortable and ill-omened words,  \"No effects.\" I am not going to defend myself. A long time ago a  journalistic colleague, who was a little uneasy at some line I took  upon this question or that, comforted himself by saying. \"Well, well,  the ship (speaking of me) swings on the tide, but the anchor holds.\"  Yes, gentlemen, I am no Pharisee, but I do believe that my anchor  holds, and your cheers show that you believe it too.    Now to India. I observed the other day that the Bishop of Lahore  said--and his words put in a very convenient form what is in the minds  of those who think about Indian questions at all--\"It is my deep  conviction that we have reached a point of the utmost gravity and of  far-reaching effect in our continued relations with this land, and I  most heartily wish there were more signs that this fact was clearly  recognised by the bulk of Englishmen out here in India, or even by our  rulers themselves.\" Now you and the democratic constituencies of this  kingdom are the rulers of India. It is to you, therefore, that I come  to render my account. Just let us see where we are. Let us put the  case. When critics assail Indian policy or any given aspect of it, I  want to know where we start from? Some of you in Arbroath wrote to  me, a year ago, and called upon me to defend the system of Indian  Government and the policy for which I am responsible. I declined, for  reasons that I stated at the moment. I am here to answer to-night,  when the time makes it more fitting in anticipation all those  difficulties which some excellent people, with whom in many ways I  sympathise, feel. Again, I say, let us see where we start from. Does  anybody want me to go to London to-morrow morning, and to send a  telegram to Lord Kitchener, the Commander-in-Chief in India, and tell  him that he is to disband the Indian army, to send home as fast as we  can despatch transports, the British contingent of the army, and bring  away the whole of the Civil servants? Suppose it to be true, as  some people in Arbroath seem to have thought--I am not arguing the  question--that Great Britain loses more than she gains; supposing it  to be true that India would have worked out her own salvation without  us; supposing it to be true that the present Government of India has  many defects--supposing all that to be true, do you want me to send  a telegram to Lord Kitchener to-morrow morning to clear out bag and  baggage? How should we look in the face of the civilised world if we  had so turned our back upon our duty and sovereign task? How should we  bear the smarting stings of our own consciences, when, as assuredly  we should, we heard through the dark distances the roar and scream of  confusion and carnage in India? Then people of this way of thinking  say \"That is not what we meant.\" Then what is it that is meant,  gentlemen? The outcome, the final outcome, of British rule in India  may be a profitable topic for the musings of meditative minds. But we  are not here to muse. We have the duty of the day to perform, we have  the tasks of to-morrow spread out before us. In the interests of  India, to say nothing of our own national honour, in the name of duty  and of common sense, our first and commanding task is to keep order  and to quell violences among race and creed; sternly to insist on the  impartial application of rules of justice,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#5)"],[1,"which  existed a third of a century ago, and it will be found that they have  progressed, and it may safely be anticipated that they will still  further progress, for there is much need of it. The system pourtrayed  in this book is intended to act on all the faculties of a child,  especially the highest, and to strengthen them at the time the mere  animal part of his nature is weak. The existing schools were not found  fit to take our children when they left us. The dull, monotonous,  sleepy, heavy system pursued, was quite unadapted to advance such  pupils. At this point of the history much damage was done to our  plans. The essence or kernel was omitted and the mere shell retained,  to make infant schools harmonise with the existing ones, instead of  the contrary. There were and are however two great exceptions to  this rule. The Model Schools at Dublin under the Government Board of  Education, and the Glasgow Training Schools for Scotland. At Dublin  all is progression. The infant department is the best in Europe,--I  believe the best in the world. The other departments are equally good  in most things, and are well managed, as far as regards a good secular  education being given, and better I think than any similar institution  in England. At Glasgow the same master whom I taught still exists. I  have not seen the schools for many years, but I hear from those who  have been trained there, that nothing can work better. The Glasgow  Committee, with Mr. Stow at their head, deserve the thanks of the  whole community for having applied the principles on which the Infant  School System is based, to juveniles, and carried out and proved the  practicability of it for the public good. I told them this in lectures  at Glasgow long ago, and exhibited before them children to prove the  truths I promulgated, both there and in other parts of Scotland,  to convince a doubting and cautious public that my views were  practicable. I may add, in passing, that I found the Scotch took  nothing on trust. They would listen to my lectures, but it always  ended in my being obliged to prove it with children. To David Stow  much credit is due, for having written useful books and performed  useful works. I am not the man to deprive him of this his just due,  but I have such faith in the honour of his countrymen in general, that  I believe the time is not far distant when some one of them will give  to me that credit which is fairly and justly due to me with respect to  the educational movements in Scotland. No class of men are better able  to appreciate and understand the principles on which a system of true  education should be based than Scotchmen, and hence, though cautious  in taking up new things, or new views of things, they can do justice  to, and appreciate, that which is worthy of their attention.    At the time I have been speaking of there were no lessons published  suitable for us. I searched the print shops in the metropolis, and  with the aid of drawings from friends, supplied this deficiency. Next  I had suitable lessons printed to accompany them, and also spelling  lessons of such words as could be _acted_ and _explained_. Then  followed suitable reading lessons, prints of objects, and the simple  forms of geometry. When a demand was created for all these, the  publishing trade took them up, and thus the numerous excellent plates  and lessons now published for the purposes of teaching, had their  first origin.    I ant thoroughly convinced that the first seven years of a child's  life is the _golden period_, and if I can induce mankind generally to  think with me, and to act on the principles humbly laid open in the  succeeding chapters of this book, I may feel some consolation that I  have not lived in vain. Sure I am that if the world will only give  man a fair chance, and train him from the beginning with care, with  prudence, with caution, with circumspection, with freedom, and above  all with _love_, he will bear such fruit, under the blessing of God,  as will make even this world as a paradise. From childhood up to age  has this truth been perfecting and strengthening in me, and I have no  more doubt that it is a truth, than I have of my own existence. Who  can look upon a child without admiring it, without loving it? With  my feelings it is impossible! When I compare the Revealed Will of  God,--the Scriptures, with His other Great Book, the book of nature,  which I read so early in life, and read with delight to this present  hour, I see the one illustrates the other. I see that the _best_  ground produces the _rankest weeds_--but not if cultivated. What does  not care do for all things in nature, why not then for man? Let him  run wild through neglect, and undoubtedly he produces weeds; but this,  to my mind, is an argument in his favour, and shews the ground is  capable of producing rich fruits. When we study the true nature of his  mind, with the same assiduity as we now do study the nature of his  body, then will mankind see it in this light, begin at the right  end, and cultivate from the first the beautiful faculties of his  own species. I say beautiful! and are not the budding faculties of  childhood both beautiful and lovely? \"Feed my lambs,\" saith the Lord  Jesus. But, reader, are they all duly fed in this rich, wealthy,  and christian country? How many, on the contrary, are fed with evil  influences, street associations, and are thus poisoned at every pore,  until their being is thoroughly contaminated through neglect, public  and private, and, when not orphans, even parental neglect also; and  then after having increased our county rates, enlarged our prisons,  and built union workhouses (with respect to morals and training for  the young, I say pest-houses) we add ragged schools. We allow them to  become contaminated, and when that is accomplished, we go to work to  undo what has been done. If this does not succeed we punish by law the  poor neglected beings for taking the poisons we really offered them!  Oh, rare consistency in this boasted age of light, and science, and  learning! Let us, therefore, first seek an education worthy of the  name, and then find the best means of carrying it out. What exists at  present is fundamentally defective, especially by beginning too late,  and as regards the plans and principles laid down for infants in many  cases, much has been merely travestied, and many of the most essential  parts entirely set aside or overlooked.    The amount of solid information that may be given to an infant by a  wise and judicious mother, during the first two years only, would  appear to many persons astonishing. I have as clear a recollection of  what my mother taught me at two years old, as I have of that which she  taught me at the age of six. The facts crowd upon me so fast that  I scarcely know where to stop. Those lessons were the germs of the  inventions and babyisms--the hand-clapping, arm-twisting, and the  like--with which the infants are so delighted in their schools, and  which, at the time they were developed, about a third of a century  since, were scouted, and the inventor looked upon as a good natured  simpleton, or a well-meaning fool. I have a rather vivid recollection  of this fact, but in the end, as we proceeded, many who came to sneer,  went away with very different feelings. The plans were for infants,  for infants they answered well, but I wish I could say that no  excresences had grown upon them.    Now the ends to be answered in Infant Education, as intended by me,  are as follows. First, to feed the child's faculties with suitable  food; Second,--to simplify and explain everything, so as to adapt it  properly to those faculties; Third, not to overdo anything, either by  giving too much instruction, or instruction beyond their years, and  thus over-excite the brain, and injure the faculties; and, Fourth,  ever to blend both exercise and amusement with instruction at due  intervals, which is readily effected by a moderate amount of singing,  alternating with the usual motions and evolutions in the schoolroom,  and the unfettered freedom of the play-ground. If these rules be  attended to, the following results are certain,--a higher state of  physical, mental, and moral health. Physical health is essential to  mental vigour if it is to come to manhood. If the physical, mental,  moral, and spiritual constitution be properly acted upon, fed, and  trained, it adds to the happiness of the child; but if this is  not done, it becomes miserable, and as a consequence restless,  troublesome, and mischievous. Such facts were made very evident to me  by the infants under my care in the earlier part of my career, and  also have been fully confirmed throughout it, and they have forced  me as it were to that more lively, interesting, and amusing mode of  instruction, which I have through life endeavoured to propagate.  I found children to be highly delighted with pictures and  object-lessons; hence their value and high importance is so strongly  insisted on in all my books, and the best methods of using them  distinctly laid down. The trouble of rightly using such lessons has  caused them to be almost entirely laid aside in very many existing  infant schools, and in too many instances the mere learning and  repeating of sounds by rote, or what may very properly be called the  \"parrot system,\" has been introduced in their place. But I yet hope  that the good sense of the public will in the end remedy such defects.  In such cases the memory is the only faculty exercised, and that at  the expense of those that are higher. Where this is persisted in, the  infant system is rendered nugatory, and my labours are in vain. It  therefore cannot be too strongly insisted on, and too frequently  repeated, that one of its most fundamental principles, as regards the  unfolding, properly and easily, of the intellectual faculties, is to  communicate _notions_ and _ideas_ rather than"]]]
