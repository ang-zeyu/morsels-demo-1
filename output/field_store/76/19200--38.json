If there is, we should have to  suppose that the contents of the will were known. Do you think they can  have leaked out, Maitre Lepertuis?\"    \"I don't think so, for Mr. Mornington seemed to behave with great  caution.\"    \"And there's no question, is there, of any indiscretion committed in  your office?\"    \"By whom? No one handled the will except myself; and I alone have the  key of the safe in which I put away documents of that importance  every evening.\"    \"The safe has not been broken into? There has been no burglary at  your office?\"    \"No.\"    \"You saw Cosmo Mornington in the morning?\"    \"Yes, on a Friday morning.\"    \"What did you do with the will until the evening, until you locked it  away up your safe?\"    \"I probably put it in the drawer of my desk.\"    \"And the drawer was not forced?\"    Maitre Lepertuis seemed taken aback and made no reply.    \"Well?\" asked Perenna.    \"Well, yes, I remember ... there was something that day ... that  same Friday.\"    \"Are you sure?\"    \"Yes. When I came in from lunch I noticed that the drawer was not locked,  although I had locked it beyond the least doubt. At the time I attached  comparatively little importance to the incident. To-day, I understand, I  understand--\"    Thus, little by little, were all the suppositions conceived by Don Luis  verified: suppositions resting, it is true, upon just one or two clues,  but yet containing an amount of intuition, of divination, that was really  surprising in a man who had been present at none of the events between  which he traced the connection so skilfully.    \"We will lose no time, Monsieur,\" said the Prefect of Police, \"in  checking your statements, which you will confess to be a little  venturesome, by the more positive evidence of one of my detectives who  has the case in charge ... and who ought to be here by now.\"    \"Does his evidence bear upon Cosmo Mornington's heirs?\" asked the  solicitor.    \"Upon the heirs principally, because two days ago he telephoned to me  that he had collected all the particulars, and also upon the very points  which--But wait: I remember that he spoke to my secretary of a murder  committed a month ago to-day.... Now it's a month to-day since Mr. Cosmo  Mornington--\"    M. Desmalions pressed hard on a bell. His private secretary at  once appeared.    \"Inspector Verot?\" asked the Prefect sharply.    \"He's not back yet.\"    \"Have him fetched! Have him brought here! He must be found at all costs  and without delay.\"    He turned to Don Luis Perenna.    \"Inspector Verot was here an hour ago, feeling rather unwell, very much  excited, it seems, and declaring that he was being watched and followed.  He said he wanted to make a most important statement to me about the  Mornington case and to warn the police of two murders which are to be  committed to-night ... and which would be a consequence of the murder of  Cosmo Mornington.\"    \"And he was unwell, you say?\"    \"Yes, ill at ease and even very queer and imagining things. By way of  being prudent, he left a detailed report on the case for me. Well, the  report is simply a blank sheet of letter-paper.    \"Here is the paper and the envelope in which I found it, and here is a  cardboard box which he also left behind him. It contains a cake of  chocolate with the marks of teeth on it.\"    \"May I look at the two things you have mentioned, Monsieur le Prefet?\"    \"Yes, but they won't tell you anything.\"    \"Perhaps so--\"    Don Luis examined at length the cardboard box and the yellow envelope,  on which were printed the words, \"Cafe du Pont-Neuf.\" The others awaited  his words as though they were bound to shed an unexpected light. He  merely said:    \"The handwriting is not the same on the envelope and the box. The writing  on the envelope is less plain, a little shaky, obviously imitated.\"    \"Which proves--?\"    \"Which proves, Monsieur le Prefet, that this yellow envelope does not  come from your detective. I presume that, after writing his report at a  table in the Cafe du Pont-Neuf and closing it, he had a moment of  inattention during which somebody substituted for his envelope another  with the same address, but containing a blank sheet of paper.\"    \"That's a supposition!\" said the Prefect.    \"Perhaps; but what is certain, Monsieur le Prefet, is that your  inspector's presentiments are well-grounded, that he is being closely  watched, that the discoveries about the Mornington inheritance which he  has succeeded in making are interfering with criminal designs, and that  he is in terrible danger.\"    \"Come, come!\"    \"He must be rescued, Monsieur le Prefet. Ever since the commencement of  this meeting I have felt persuaded that we are up against an attempt  which has already begun. I hope that it is not too late and that your  inspector has not been the first victim.\"    \"My dear sir,\" exclaimed the Prefect of Police, \"you declare all this  with a conviction which rouses my admiration, but which is not enough to  establish the fact that your fears are justified. Inspector Verot's  return will be the best proof.\"    \"Inspector Verot will not return.\"    \"But why not?\"    \"Because he has returned already. The messenger saw him return.\"    \"The messenger was dreaming. If you have no proof but that man's  evidence--\"    \"I have another proof, Monsieur le Prefet, which Inspector Verot himself  has left of his presence here: these few, almost illegible letters which  he scribbled on this memorandum pad, which your secretary did not see him  write and which have just caught my eye. Look at them. Are they not a  proof, a definite proof that he came back?\"    The Prefect did not conceal his perturbation. The others all seemed  impressed. The secretary's return but increased their apprehensions:  nobody had seen Inspector Verot.    \"Monsieur le Prefet,\" said Don Luis, \"I earnestly beg you to have the  office messenger in.\"    And, as soon as the messenger was there, he asked him, without even  waiting for M. Desmalions to speak:    \"Are you sure that Inspector Verot entered this room a second time?\"    \"Absolutely sure.\"    \"And that he did not go out again?\"    \"Absolutely sure.\"    \"And your attention was not distracted for a moment?\"    \"Not for a moment.\"    \"There, Monsieur, you see!\" cried the Prefect. \"If Inspector Verot were  here, we should know it.\"    \"He is here, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"What!\"    \"Excuse my obstinacy, Monsieur le Prefet, but I say that, when some one  enters a room and does not go out again, he is still in that room.\"    \"Hiding?\" said M. Desmalions, who was growing more and more irritated.    \"No, but fainting, ill--dead, perhaps.\"    \"But where, hang it all?\"    \"Behind that screen.\"    \"There's nothing behind that screen, nothing but a door.\"    \"And that door--?\"    \"Leads to a dressing-room.\"    \"Well, Monsieur le Prefet, Inspector Verot, tottering, losing his head,  imagining himself to be going from your office to your secretary's room,  fell into your dressing-room.\"    M. Desmalions ran to the door, but, at the moment of opening it, shrank  back. Was it apprehension, the wish to withdraw himself from the  influence of that astonishing man, who gave his orders with such  authority and who seemed to command events themselves?    Don Luis stood waiting imperturbably, in a deferential attitude.    \"I cannot believe--\" said M. Desmalions.    \"Monsieur le Prefet, I would remind you that Inspector Verot's  revelations may save the lives of two persons who are doomed to die  to-night. Every minute lost is irreparable.\"    M. Desmalions shrugged his shoulders. But that man mastered him with the  power of his conviction; and the Prefect opened the door.    He did not make a movement, did not utter a cry. He simply muttered:    \"Oh, is it possible!--\"    By the pale gleam of light that entered through a ground-glass window  they saw the body of a man lying on the floor.    \"The inspector! Inspector Verot!\" gasped the office messenger,  running forward.    He and the secretary raised the body and placed it in an armchair in the  Prefect's office.    Inspector Verot was still alive, but so little alive that they could  scarcely hear the beating of his heart. A drop of saliva trickled from  the corner of his mouth. His eyes were devoid of all expression. However,  certain muscles of the face kept moving, perhaps with the effort of a  will that seemed to linger almost beyond life.    Don Luis muttered:    \"Look, Monsieur le Prefet--the brown patches!\"    The same dread unnerved all. They began to ring bells and open doors and  call for help.    \"Send for the doctor!\" ordered M. Desmalions. \"Tell them to bring a  doctor, the first that comes--and a priest. We can't let the poor man--\"    Don Luis raised his arm to demand silence.    \"There is nothing more to be done,\" he said. \"We shall do better to  make the most of these last moments. Have I your permission, Monsieur  le Prefet?\"    He bent over the dying man, laid the swaying head against the back of the  chair, and, in a very gentle voice, whispered:    \"Verot, it's Monsieur le Prefet speaking to you. We should like a few  particulars about what is to take place to-night. Do you hear me, Verot?  If you hear me, close your eyelids.\"    The eyelids were lowered. But was it not merely chance? Don Luis went on:    \"You have found the heirs of the Roussel sisters, that much we know; and  it is two of those heirs who are threatened with death. The double murder  is to be committed to-night. But what we do not know is the name of those  heirs, who are doubtless not called Roussel. You must tell us the name.    \"Listen to me: you wrote on a memorandum pad three letters which seem to  form the syllable Fau.... Am I right? Is this the first syllable of a  name?

I duly  received all your letters, and though I did not reply to them, you were  constantly present with me, and my heart beats as tenderly as ever for you.

TO WEGELER.    Vienna, June 29, 1800.    MY DEAR AND VALUED WEGELER,--    How much I thank you for your remembrance of me, little as I deserve it, or  have sought to deserve it; and yet you are so kind that you allow nothing,  not even my unpardonable neglect, to discourage you, always remaining the  same true, good, and faithful friend. That I can ever forget you or yours,  once so dear and precious to me, do not for a moment believe. There are  times when I find myself longing to see you again, and wishing that I could  go to stay with you. My father-land, that lovely region where I first saw  the light, is still as distinct and beauteous in my eyes as when I quitted  you; in short, I shall esteem the time when I once more see you, and again  greet Father Rhine, as one of the happiest periods of my life. When this  may be I cannot yet tell; but at all events I may say that you shall not  see me again till I have become eminent, not only as an artist, but better  and more perfect as a man; and if the condition of our father-land be then  more prosperous, my art shall be entirely devoted to the benefit of the  poor. Oh, blissful moment!--how happy do I esteem myself that I can  expedite it and bring it to pass!    You desire to know something of my position; well! it is by no means bad.  However incredible it may appear, I must tell you that Lichnowsky has been,  and still is, my warmest friend (slight dissensions occurred occasionally  between us, and yet they only served to strengthen our friendship). He  settled on me last year the sum of 600 florins, for which I am to draw on  him till I can procure some suitable situation. My compositions are very  profitable, and I may really say that I have almost more commissions than  it is possible for me to execute. I can have six or seven publishers or  more for every piece, if I choose; they no longer bargain with me--I  demand, and they pay--so you see this is a very good thing. For instance, I  have a friend in distress, and my purse does not admit of my assisting him  at once; but I have only to sit down and write, and in a short time he is  relieved. I am also become more economical than formerly. If I finally  settle here, I don't doubt I shall be able to secure a particular day every  year for a concert, of which I have already given several. That malicious  demon, however, bad health, has been a stumbling-block in my path; my  hearing during the last three years has become gradually worse. The chief  cause of this infirmity proceeds from the state of my digestive organs,  which, as you know, were formerly bad enough, but have latterly become much  worse, and being constantly afflicted with diarrhoea, has brought on  extreme weakness. Frank [Director of the General Hospital] strove to  restore the tone of my digestion by tonics, and my hearing by oil of  almonds; but alas! these did me no good whatever; my hearing became worse,  and my digestion continued in its former plight. This went on till the  autumn of last year, when I was often reduced to utter despair. Then some  medical _asinus_ recommended me cold baths, but a more judicious doctor the  tepid ones of the Danube, which did wonders for me; my digestion improved,  but my hearing remained the same, or in fact rather got worse. I did indeed  pass a miserable winter; I suffered from most dreadful spasms, and sank  back into my former condition. Thus it went on till about a month ago, when  I consulted Vering [an army surgeon], under the belief that my maladies  required surgical advice; besides, I had every confidence in him. He  succeeded in almost entirely checking the violent diarrhoea, and ordered me  the tepid baths of the Danube, into which I pour some strengthening  mixture. He gave me no medicine, except some digestive pills four days ago,  and a lotion for my ears. I certainly do feel better and stronger, but my  ears are buzzing and ringing perpetually, day and night. I can with truth  say that my life is very wretched; for nearly two years past I have avoided  all society, because I find it impossible to say to people, _I am deaf!_ In  any other profession this might be more tolerable, but in mine such a  condition is truly frightful. Besides, what would my enemies say to  this?--and they are not few in number.    To give you some idea of my extraordinary deafness, I must tell you that in  the theatre I am obliged to lean close up against the orchestra in order to  understand the actors, and when a little way off I hear none of the high  notes of instruments or singers. It is most astonishing that in  conversation some people never seem to observe this; being subject to fits  of absence, they attribute it to that cause. I often can scarcely hear a  person if speaking low; I can distinguish the tones, but not the words, and  yet I feel it intolerable if any one shouts to me. Heaven alone knows how  it is to end! Vering declares that I shall certainly improve, even if I be  not entirely restored. How often have I cursed my existence! Plutarch led  me to resignation. I shall strive if possible to set Fate at defiance,  although there must be moments in my life when I cannot fail to be the most  unhappy of God's creatures. I entreat you to say nothing of my affliction  to any one, not even to Lorchen [see Nos. 4 and 5]. I confide the secret to  you alone, and entreat you some day to correspond with Vering on the  subject. If I continue in the same state, I shall come to you in the  ensuing spring, when you must engage a house for me somewhere in the  country, amid beautiful scenery, and I shall then become a rustic for a  year, which may perhaps effect a change. Resignation!--what a miserable  refuge! and yet it is my sole remaining one. You will forgive my thus  appealing to your kindly sympathies at a time when your own position is sad  enough. Stephan Breuning is here, and we are together almost every day; it  does me so much good to revive old feelings! He has really become a capital  good fellow, not devoid of talent, and his heart, like that of us all,  pretty much in the right place. [See No. 13.]    I have very charming rooms at present, adjoining the Bastei [the ramparts],  and peculiarly valuable to me on account of my health [at Baron  Pasqualati's]. I do really think I shall be able to arrange that Breuning  shall come to me. You shall have your Antiochus [a picture], and plenty of  my music besides--if, indeed, it will not cost you too much. Your love of  art does honestly rejoice me. Only say how it is to be done, and I will  send you all my works, which now amount to a considerable number, and are  daily increasing. I beg you will let me have my grandfather's portrait as  soon as possible by the post, in return for which I send you that of his  grandson, your loving and attached Beethoven. It has been brought out here  by Artaria, who, as well as many other publishers, has often urged this on  me. I intend soon to write to Stoffeln [Christoph von Breuning], and  plainly admonish him about his surly humor. I mean to sound in his ears our  old friendship, and to insist on his promising me not to annoy you further  in your sad circumstances. I will also write to the amiable Lorchen. Never  have I forgotten one of you, my kind friends, though you did not hear from  me; but you know well that writing never was my _forte_, even my best  friends having received no letters from me for years. I live wholly in my  music, and scarcely is one work finished when another is begun; indeed, I  am now often at work on three or four things at the same time. Do write to  me frequently, and I will strive to find time to write to you also. Give my  remembrances to all, especially to the kind Frau Hofraethin [von Breuning],  and say to her that I am still subject to an occasional _raptus_. As for  K----, I am not at all surprised at the change in her: Fortune rolls like a  ball, and does not always stop before the best and noblest. As to Ries  [Court musician in Bonn], to whom pray cordially remember me, I must say  one word. I will write to you more particularly about his son [Ferdinand],  although I believe that he would be more likely to succeed in Paris than in  Vienna, which is already overstocked, and where even those of the highest  merit find it a hard matter to maintain themselves. By next autumn or  winter, I shall be able to see what can be done for him, because then all  the world returns to town. Farewell, my kind, faithful Wegeler! Rest  assured of the love and friendship of your    BEETHOVEN.      15.    TO COUNTESS GIULIETTA GUICCIARDI.[1]    Morning, July 6, 1800.    MY ANGEL! MY ALL! MY SECOND SELF!
