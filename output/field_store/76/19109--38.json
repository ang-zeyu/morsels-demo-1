Volume 10, No. 289, (#5)"],[1," was treated in the usual way for the  space of half an hour without success: when a ligature being applied to  the arm, above a vein that had been previously opened, ten ounces of  blood were withdrawn, after which the circulation and respiration  gradually returned, though accompanied by the most dreadful convulsions.  A second, and a third bleeding was had recourse to, which brought about  a favourable sleep, and ultimate recovery on the ensuing day.    _Iron_.    It is a singular fact, that the value of the iron annually produced in  England greatly exceeds the value of the silver annually produced in  Peru.    _Hair_.    At a recent meeting of the Academy of Sciences, at Paris, M. F. Cuvier,  in a memoir on the generation of feathers, spines, and hair, introduced  the following curious conclusion:--\"I consider the organic system which  produces hair as analogous to that of the senses, and even as forming  part of them; for the hair is in a great number of animals a very  sensitive organ of touch. It is not only in mustaches that we have a  proof of it, but on the whole surface of the body. The slightest touch  of a hair is sufficient in cats, for example, to make them contort their  skin and shudder, as they do when they find something light attached to  the hair, and that they wish to shake off.\"    _Population of England_.    The United Kingdom of Britain and Ireland contains 74 millions of acres,  of which at least 64 millions of acres may be considered capable of  cultivation. Half an acre, with ordinary cultivation, is sufficient to  supply an individual with corn, and one acre is sufficient to maintain a  horse; consequently, the united kingdom contains land enough for the  sustenance of 120 millions of people, and four millions of  horses.--_Edmunds on Political Economy_.    _Singing_.    The following passage from a letter by the late _Carl M. Von Weber_  appears to be worthy of the attention of dramatic and other singers:--    \"Every singer imparts, though unconsciously, the colouring of his own  individual character to the dramatic character which he sustains. Thus,  two singers, the one possessed of a slight and flexible voice, the other  of an organ of great volume and power, will give the same composition in  a manner widely different. The one will, doubtless, be more animated  than the other; and yet both may do justice to the composer, inasmuch as  both mark the gradations of passion in his composition, faithfully and  expressively, according to the nature and degree of power possessed by  each. But it is the duty of the music director to prevent the singer  from deceiving himself, by following too exclusively what at first  appears to him most suitable. This caution is particularly necessary  with respect to certain passages, but the effect of the whole piece  should not suffer for the sake of some favourite roulade, which the  singer must needs introduce.\"    _Culture of Turnips._    Until the beginning of the eighteenth century, this valuable root was  cultivated among us only in gardens or other small spots, for culinary  purposes; but Lord Townshend, attending King George the First on one of  his excursions to Germany, in the quality of secretary of State,  observed the turnip cultivated in open and extensive fields, as fodder  for cattle, and spreading fertility over lands naturally barren; and on  his return to England he brought over with him some of the seed, and  strongly recommended the practice which he had witnessed to the adoption  of his own tenants, who occupied a soil similar to that of Hanover. The  experiment succeeded; the cultivation of field turnips gradually spread  over the whole county of Norfolk; and in the course of time it has made  its way into every other district of England. The reputation of the  county as an agricultural district dates from the vast improvements of  heaths, wastes, sheepwalks, and warrens, by enclosure and manuring--the  fruit of the zealous exertions of Lord Townshend and a few neighbouring  land-owners--which were, ere long, happily imitated by others. Since  these improvements were effected, rents have risen in that county from  one or two shillings to fifteen or twenty shillings per acre; a country  of sheep-walks and rabbit-warrens has been rendered highly productive;  and by dint of management, what was thus gained has been preserved and  improved even to the present moment. Some of the finest corn-crops in  the world are now grown upon lands which, before the introduction of the  turnip husbandry, produced a very scanty supply of grass for a few lean  and half-starved rabbits. Mr. Colquhoun, in his \"Statistical  Researches,\" estimated the value of the turnip crop annually grown in  this country at fourteen millions; but when we further recollect that it  enables the agriculturist to reclaim and cultivate land which, without  its aid, would remain in a hopeless state of natural barrenness; that it  leaves the land so clean and in such fine condition, as almost to insure  a good crop of barley and a kind plant of clover, and that this clover  is found a most excellent preparative for wheat, it will appear that the  subsequent advantages derived from a crop of turnips must infinitely  exceed its estimated value as fodder for cattle. If we were, therefore,  asked to point out the individual who, in modern times, has proved the  greatest benefactor to the community, we should not hesitate to fix upon  the ingenious nobleman, whom the wits and courtiers of his own day were  pleased to laugh at as \"Turnip Townshend.\" In something less than one  hundred years, the agricultural practice which he introduced from  Hanover has spread itself throughout this country, and now yields an  annual return which, probably, exceeds the interest of our national  debt.--_Sir Walter Scott--in the Quarterly Review._    _Coals in the East._    The Dutch newspapers state, that extensive coal mines have been  discovered in Sumatra and Bantam.    _Naphtha_    Has been found to burn much better than other oils in mines where bad  air prevails, and is less injurious to the health of the workmen. Oil of  colza and tallow are extinguished, where naphtha, petroleum, and oil of  bone, continue burning.    _Fossils._    Plates of above 600 fossil bones, (remains of a former world) recently  discovered in the neighbourhood of Issoire, in France, are preparing for  publication. They belong to more than 50 species of animals, now  extinct; among which are elephants, horses, tapirs, rhinoceri, eleven or  twelve kinds of stags, large cats, oxen, bears, dogs, otters, &c.           *       *       *       *       *    SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.           *       *       *       *       *    POTIER, THE FRENCH \"LISTON.\"    Potier, generally speaking--and it is the same with our own Liston--has  never Actually observed any thing of what he presents to us. It is the  spontaneous effusion of his own feelings--the immediate creation of his  own mind--frequently arising at the moment at which we see it, and  therefore never to be seen a second time--but always generated by the  actor himself, and never mixed up with any thing else of an extraneous  nature. This is one cause of the extraordinary variety of this actor,  and consequently of his extraordinary popularity in his own country. We  never tire of going to see him, because he is never the same on any two  nights--or rather he never performs the same character twice in the same  manner. It is also the secret of his unrivalled originality. There are  but very few characters in which he can repeat himself, even if he  would. And those are such as depend for their comicality upon collateral  circumstances connected with them, rather than upon any thing essential  to themselves.    There are some persons whose every look, feature, expression, and tone  of voice conduce to comic effects; and many an actor has owed his  success more to these than to any mental qualities or dispositions  corresponding with them; or has even been successful in spite of these  latter being in no degree adapted to the profession which circumstances  have induced him to adopt. In proof of this fact, comic actors are quite  as often dull and solemn people, as droll ones, in private life. The  most remarkable instance of a face being a fortune, in this respect, is  our own Liston. If he had not possessed a comic countenance, nothing  could have prevented him from being a tragic actor, or have made him a  comic one; for it is well understood that all his inclinations led him  in that direction. The truth is, that Liston's style of acting is too  chaste and natural to have been so universally popular as it is, but for  the irresistible drollery of his features--which are the finest farce  that ever was written. Now in this respect, as in all others, Potier  differs from his contemporaries.    His voice, his face, and his person altogether, are in themselves  antidotes to mirth, and might almost be supposed to set it at defiance.  He might play the _Apothecary_, in _Romeo and Juliet_, or the _Anatomie  Vivante_, without painting for them--as Stephen Kemble used to play  their antithesis, _Falstaff_, without stuffing. And yet, instead of this  seeming contradiction counteracting the essentially comic turn of his  mind, the latter is so completely paramount, that it changes every thing  within its reach to its own complexion.--_New Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *    FRAGMENT OF THE NARRATIVE OF A STUDENT AT LAW.

[Illustration]    The Shouaa Arabs are a very extraordinary race, and have scarcely any  resemblance to the Arabs of the north; they have fine open  countenances, with aquiline noses, and large eyes; their complexion is  a light copper-colour; they possess great cunning with their courage,  and resemble in appearance some of our best favoured gipsies in  England, particularly the _women_; and their Arabic is nearly pure  Egyptian.    The best residences of the Shouaas consist of two enclosures, besides  one for their horses, cows, and goats. In the first of these divisions  is a circular hut, with a cupola top, well thatched with gussub straw,  something resembling that of the Indian corn; the walls are of the  same materials; a mud wall, of about two feet high, separates one part  from the rest, and here their corn is kept; and a bench of like  composition, at the opposite side, is their resting-place; this is  covered with mats; and spears and wooden bowls for water and milk,  hang on pegs, and complete the furniture; here is the master's own  apartment. In the second division are two huts, rather smaller, about  ten paces from each other, in which dwell his wives.        AFRICAN FUNERALS.      The custom of burying the dead in the floor of dwelling-houses, is  prevalent on the Gold Coast of Africa, as far as that country is known  to Europeans. The ceremony is purely Pagan, and without any form,  except that of the females of the family of the deceased and their  friends making a mournful lamentation; and in some instances they work  their feelings up to such a degree of apparent sorrow, that their  conduct has every symptom of insanity. This scene of revelry is not a  little heightened by the profuse use of ardent spirits, which has so  powerful an attraction, that drummers, flute-players, bards, and  singing men come from great distances to partake of the libations; and  as the savage uproar lasts often for a week, it leads to every kind of  dissolute practice in both sexes. Another custom, or repetition of  this barbarous usage, frequently takes place seven years after the  demise of persons of consequence, which is still more expensive than  the former: as such are the baneful prejudices in favour of these  habits, that families have too frequently pawned their relatives to  raise money to defray the expense; they purchase cattle, sheep, goats,  and poultry, and with the assistance of what is brought by their  friends and acquaintances, they are enabled to keep up a scene of riot  for many days. The carcasses of animals sacrificed are not burned and  sown in the wind as in times of old, but the Fantees more wisely, eat  them, greater attention being paid to the flavour of the viands and  the fragrance of the strong liquor than to the manes of the dead.           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.      WILLY M'GEE'S MONKEY.      I dinna think that in a' nature there's a mair curiouser cratur than  a monkey. I mak this observe frae being witness to an extraordinar'  event that took place in Hamilton. Folk may talk as they like about  monkeys, and cry them down for being stupid and mischievous, I for  ane will no gang that length. Whatever they may be on the score  of mischief, there can be nae doubt, that, sae far as gumption is  concerned, they are just uncommon; and for wit and fun they would beat  ony man black and blue. In fact, I dinna think that monkeys are beasts  ava. I hae a half notion that they are just wee hairy men that canna,  or rather that winna speak, in case they be made to work like ither  folk, instead of leading a life of idleness.    But to the point: I ance had a monkey, ane of the drollest-looking  deevils ye ever saw. He was gayan big for a monkey, and was hairy  a' ower, except his face and his bit hurdies, which had a degree of  bareness about them, and were nearly as saft as a lady's loof. Weel,  what think ye that I did wi' the beastie? Odds, man, I dressed him up  like a Heelandman, and put a kilt upon him, and a lang-tailed red  coat, and a blue bannet, which for security's sake I tied, woman-like,  below his chin wi' twa bits of yellow ribbon. I not only did this, but  I learnt him to walk upon his twa hinder legs, and to carry a stick  in his right hand when he gaed out, the better to support him in his  peregrinations. He was for a' the world like a wee man in kilts.    Weel, it turned out in this manner, as ye shall hear. Ae afternoon  towards the glomin' I was oblegated to tak' a stap doun to the cross,  wi' a web under my arm, which I had finished for Mr. Weft, the muslin  manufacturer. By way of frolic, a gayan foolish ane I allow, I brocht  Nosey (the monkey's name,) alang wi' me. He had on, as for ordinar',  his Heeland dress, and walkit behint me, wi' the bit stick in his  hand, and his tail sticking out frae below his kilt, as if he had been  my flunky. It was, after a', a queer sicht, and, as may be supposed, I  drew a haill crowd of bairns after me, bawling out, \"Here's Willy  M'Gee's monkey,\" and gi'eing him nits and gingerbread, and makin' as  muckle of the cratur as could be; for Nosey was a great favourite in  the town, and everbody likit him for his droll tricks, and the way he  used to girn, and dance, and tumble ower his head, to amuse them.    On entering Mr. Weft's shop, I faund it empty; there wasna a leeving  soul within. I supposed he had gane out for a licht; and being gayan  familiar wi' him, I took a stap ben to the back shop, leaving Nosey in  the fore ane. I sat for twa or three minutes, but naebody made his  appearance. At last the front door, which I had ta'en care to shut  after me, opened, and I look't to see wha it could be, thinking that,  nae doubt, it was Mr. Weft, or his apprentice. It was neither the ane  nor the ither, but a strong middle-aged, red-faced Heelandman, wi'  specks on, and wi' a kilt and a bannet, by a' the world like my  monkey's. Now, what think ye Nosey was about a' this time? He was  sittin' behind the counter upon the lang three-leggit stool that stood  fornent Mr. Weft's desk, and was turning ower the leaves of his  ledger, wi' a look which, for auld-fashioned sagaciousness, was  wonderfu' to behold. I was sae tickled at the sight that I paid nae  sort of attention to the Heelandman, but continued looking frae the  back shop at Nosey, lauching a' the time in my sleeve--for I jealoused  that some queer scene would tak' place between the twa. And I wasna  far wrang, for the stranger, takin' out a pound frae his spleuchan,  handed it ower to the monkey, and speered at him, in his droll norlan  deealect, if he could change a note. When I heard this I thocht I  would hae lauched outricht; and naething but sheer curiosity to see  how the thing would end made me keep my gravity. It was plain that  Donald had ta'en Nosey for ane of his ain countrymen--and the thing  after a' wasna greatly to be wondered at, and that for three  reasons:--    Firstly, the shop was rather darkish.    Secondly, the Heelandman had on specks, as I hae just said; and it was  likely on this account that he was rather short-sighted; and    Thirdly, Nosey, wi' his kilt, and bannet, and red coat, was, to a'  intents and purposes, as like a human creatur as a monkey could weel  be.    Nae sooner, then, had he got the note, than he opened it out, and  lookit at it wi' his wee glowrin', restless een, as if to see that it  wasna a forgery. He then shook his head like a doctor, when he's no  very sure what's wrang wi' a person, but wants to mak' it appear that  he kens a' about it--and continued in this style till the Heelandman's  patience began to get exhausted.    \"Can ye no change the note, old shentleman?\" quo' Donald. Nosey gi'ed  his head anither shake, and looked uncommon wise.    \"Is the note no goot, sir?\"' spak the Heelandman, a second time; but  the cratur, instead of answering him, only gi'ed anither of his wise  shakes, as much as to say, \"I'm no very sure about it.\" At this Donald  lost temper. \"If the note doesna please ye, sir,\" quo' he, \"I'll thank  ye to gie me it back again, and I'll gang to some ither place.\" And he  stretchit out his hand to tak hand o't, when my frien' wi' the tail,  lifting up his stick, lent him sic a whack ower the fingers as made  him pu' back in the twinkling of an ee.    \"Got tamn ye, ye auld scounrel,\" said the man; \"do ye mean to tak my  money frae me?\" And he lifted up a rung big eneuch to fell a stot, and  let flee at the monkey; but Nosey was ower quick for him, and jumping  aside, he lichted on a shelf before ane could say Jock Robinson. Here  he rowed up the note like a baw in his hand, and put it into his coat  pouch like any rational cratur. Not only this, but he mockit the  Heelandman by a' manner of means, shooting out his tongue at him,  spitting at him, and girning at him wi' his queer outlandish  physiognomy. Then he would tak haud of his tail in his twa hands, and  wag it at Donald, and steeking his nieves, he would seem to threaten  him wi' a leatherin'. A'thegither he was desperate impudent, and  eneuch to try the patience of a saunt, no to spak o' a het-bluided  Heelandman. It was gude for sair een to see how Donald behavit on this  occasion. He raged like ane demented, misca'ing the monkey beyond  measure, and swearing as mony Gaelic aiths as micht hae sair'd an  ordinar man for a twalmonth. During this time, I never sterr'd a foot, "]]]
