[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],[0,"Independent Bohemia (#4)"],[1," ended in 1866, when after Austria's defeat the clever diplomacy of Bismarck  turned the rivalry between Austria and Prussia into friendship. Since the  Germans in Austria began to feel their impotence in the face of the growing  Slav power, a year later the centralising efforts of the Habsburgs were  finally embodied in the system of dualism which gave over the Slavs and  Italians in Austria to German hegemony and the Slavs and Rumanians in  Hungary to Magyar tyranny. For the support of this hegemony the Austrian  Germans and Magyars, whose ambitions are identical with those of Germany,  were entirely dependent on Berlin. Thus Austria-Hungary became inevitably  Germany's partner and vanguard in the south-east. Finally, the present war  was started by the Germans and Magyars with the object of achieving the  ambitious plans preached and expounded by Pan-German writers for years  past. The Germans wanted at all costs to become the masters of Central  Europe, to build an empire from Berlin to Bagdad, and finally to strike for  world domination.    2. In this turn of events Magyar influence played a greater part than might  be thought. Already in 1848 Kossuth defined the Hungarian foreign policy as  follows:--        \"The Magyar nation is bound to maintain the most cordial relations with      the free German nation and help it in safeguarding Western      civilisation.\"    And while the Hungarian Slavs were prohibited from attending the Pan-Slav  Congress held in Prague in 1848, the Magyars sent two delegates to  Frankfurt in order to give practical expression to the above Magyar policy.    The value of Hungary for the Pan-German plans has been expressed by  Friedrich List who, in 1862, dreamt of \"a powerful oriental German-Magyar  Empire,\" and declared:        \"The way towards the realisation of this plan runs through Hungary, and      while without Hungary we can do nothing, with her aid we can do      everything. Hungary is for Germany the clue to Turkey and the Near      East, and at the same time a bulwark against a superior power from the      north.\"    The Magyars realised from the beginning the importance of an understanding  between themselves and Prussia, and they directed their foreign policy  accordingly. The setting up of dualism in 1867, which finally established  the German-Magyar hegemony in Austria-Hungary in the interests of Prussia,  was the work of two Magyars--Julius Andrassy and Francis Deak, who took  advantage of Austria's defeat at Sadova to further their interests. In  1870, when Vienna contemplated revenge against Prussia, the Magyars again  intervened in favour of Prussia. When questioned as to Hungary's attitude,  Andrassy, then Premier, declared in the Hungarian Parliament that under no  circumstances would he allow any action against Prussia, and exerted all  his influence in Vienna to that effect. It was also due mainly to Magyar  influence that all attempts of the Czechs to weaken German influence in  Austria were frustrated. Francis Joseph always promised to be crowned King  of Bohemia when he wished to placate the Czechs in times of stress for  Austria: in 1861, 1865, 1870 and 1871. But he never carried out his  promises. In this he was guided not only by considerations of dynastic  interest, but also by the advice of the Magyars.    But the most decisive and fateful exercise of Magyar influence upon  Austria's foreign policy occurred in 1879, when the Austro-German Alliance  was finally concluded. This was equally the work of Bismarck, who spared  the defeated Austria in order to make an ally of her, and of a  Magyar--Count Andrassy--who from 1871 to 1879 was the Austro-Hungarian  Foreign Minister. It was this Magyar help which made Bismarck utter words  of gratitude and declare in 1883:        \"Our political judgment leads us to the conviction that German and      Magyar interests are inseparable.\"    It is true that there always was a Magyar opposition against Austria  (though never against Prussia). But this opposition was used as a weapon to  extort concessions from Austria. At the bottom of their hearts, however,  the Austrian Germans were always at one with the Magyars in their common  desire to oppress the Slavs. And the responsibility of Count Tisza for the  present world catastrophe is just as great as that of the Kaiser himself.    3. The Czechs saw clearly the progress of events. Bismarck was well aware  of the importance of Bohemia, for he declared that the master of Bohemia  would become the master of Europe. He did not desire to annex any Austrian  territory, since he knew that sooner or later Germany would swallow the  whole of Austria, as she has done in this war. Indeed, at the Congress of  Berlin in 1878, Bismarck did not conceal his intention of using  Austria-Hungary in Germany's interests. At the bottom of his heart he was  at one with the radical Pan-German writers, like Lagarde, Treitschke,  Mommsen, Naumann and others, who openly declared that the Slavs should be  subjugated and the Czechs, as the most courageous and therefore the most  dangerous of them, crushed.    The Slavs always bitterly opposed the encroachments of Germanism, and saw  in it their chief enemy. The Czech leader Palacky rejected the invitation  to Frankfurt in 1848 and summoned a Slav Congress to Prague. It is true  that Palacky at that time dreamt of an Austria just to all her nations. He  advocated a strong Austria as a federation of nations to counterbalance  Pan-Germanism. Yet at the same time Palacky has proved through his history  and work that Bohemia has full right to independence. He was well aware  that a federalistic and just Austria would have to grant independence to  the Czecho-Slovaks. But later on he gave up his illusions about the  possibility of a just Austria, when he saw that she abandoned the Slavs  entirely to German-Magyar hegemony, and declared that Bohemia existed  before Austria and would also exist after her. In 1866 he wrote:        \"I myself now give up all hope of a long preservation of the Austrian      Empire; not because it is not desirable or has no mission to fulfil,      but because it allowed the Germans and Magyars to grasp the reins of      government and to found in it their racial tyranny.\"    Exasperated by the pact of dualism which the Czechs never recognised,  Palacky went to Moscow and on his return declared:        \"I have already said that I do not cherish any hopes of the      preservation of Austria, especially since the Germans and Magyars made      it the home of their racial despotism; the question therefore as to      what will happen to the Slavs hitherto living in Austria is not without      significance. Without attempting to prophesy future events which for a      mortal man it is difficult to foreshadow, I may say from my inner      conviction that the Czechs as a nation, if they fell under the      subjection of either Russia or Prussia, would never rest contented. It      would never fade from their memory that according to right or justice      they should be ruled by themselves, that is by their own government and      by their own sovereign. They would regard the Prussians as their deadly      enemies on account of their germanising rage. But as to the Russians,      the Czechs would regard them as their racial brothers and friends; they      would not become their faithful subjects, but their true allies and, if      need be, vanguards in Europe.\"    Moreover, modern Czech politicians always clearly saw what the Germans were  aiming at. Dr. Kramar, for instance, foresaw the present situation with  remarkable perspicacity. In the _Revue de Paris_ for February, 1899, he  wrote on \"The Future of Austria,\" declaring that her subject nationalities  should be on guard lest she should become a vassal of Germany and a bridge  for German expansion into Asia:        \"The Austrian Germans wish to see Austria subordinated to German      policy, and with the help of a subordinated Austria, the sphere of      German political and economic activity would extend from Hamburg to      Asia Minor.\"    Similarly also he warned Great Britain in the _National Review_ for  October, 1902, that if Pan-German plans were realised,        \"Austria would become an appanage of Germany as regards international      relations, and the policy of Europe would be obliged to reckon, not      with a free and independent Austria, but, owing to Austria's      unconditional self-surrender, with a mighty, almost invincible      Germany.... The Pan-Germans are right, the Czechs are an arrow in the      side of Germany, and such they wish to and must and will remain. Their      firm and unchangeable hope is that they will succeed in making of      themselves an impenetrable breakwater. They hope for no foreign help;      they neither wish for it nor ask for it. They have only one desire,      namely, that non-German Europe may also at last show that it      understands the meaning of the Bohemian question.\"    In 1906 Dr. Kramar wrote again in detail on the plans of German domination  in Central Europe, in the Adriatic and in the Near East. In a book on Czech  policy he declared that to prevent the realisation of these plans was the  vital interest of the Czech nation: \"A far-seeing Austrian policy should  see in the Czech nation the safeguard of the independence of the State.\"  And then followed the famous passage which formed part of the \"evidence\"  quoted against him during his trial for high treason:        \"If Austria-Hungary continues her internal policy by centralising in      order to be better able to germanise and preserve the German character      of the State, if she does not resist all efforts for the creation of a      customs and economic union with Germany, the Pan-German movement will      prove fatal for her. To preserve and maintain a state the sole ambition      of which was to be a second German State after Germany, would be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9662"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (#4)"],[1,"idea of  inveterate revenge or cruelty; nor can a selfish heart easily conceive  the heights of friendship and generosity. It is readily allowed, that  other beings may possess many senses of which we can have no conception;  because the ideas of them have never been introduced to us in the only  manner by which an idea can have access to the mind, to wit, by the  actual feeling and sensation.    16. There is, however, one contradictory phenomenon, which may prove  that it is not absolutely impossible for ideas to arise, independent of  their correspondent impressions. I believe it will readily be allowed,  that the several distinct ideas of colour, which enter by the eye, or  those of sound, which are conveyed by the ear, are really different from  each other; though, at the same time, resembling. Now if this be true of  different colours, it must be no less so of the different shades of the  same colour; and each shade produces a distinct idea, independent of the  rest. For if this should be denied, it is possible, by the continual  gradation of shades, to run a colour insensibly into what is most remote  from it; and if you will not allow any of the means to be different, you  cannot, without absurdity, deny the extremes to be the same. Suppose,  therefore, a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to  have become perfectly acquainted with colours of all kinds except one  particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has been his  fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of that colour,  except that single one, be placed before him, descending gradually from  the deepest to the lightest; it is plain that he will perceive a blank,  where that shade is wanting, and will be sensible that there is a  greater distance in that place between the contiguous colours than in  any other. Now I ask, whether it be possible for him, from his own  imagination, to supply this deficiency, and raise up to himself the idea  of that particular shade, though it had never been conveyed to him by  his senses? I believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can:  and this may serve as a proof that the simple ideas are not always, in  every instance, derived from the correspondent impressions; though this  instance is so singular, that it is scarcely worth our observing, and  does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim.    17. Here, therefore, is a proposition, which not only seems, in itself,  simple and intelligible; but, if a proper use were made of it, might  render every dispute equally intelligible, and banish all that jargon,  which has so long taken possession of metaphysical reasonings, and drawn  disgrace upon them. All ideas, especially abstract ones, are naturally  faint and obscure: the mind has but a slender hold of them: they are apt  to be confounded with other resembling ideas; and when we have often  employed any term, though without a distinct meaning, we are apt to  imagine it has a determinate idea annexed to it. On the contrary, all  impressions, that is, all sensations, either outward or inward, are  strong and vivid: the limits between them are more exactly determined:  nor is it easy to fall into any error or mistake with regard to them.  When we entertain, therefore, any suspicion that a philosophical term is  employed without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent), we need  but enquire, _from what impression is that supposed idea derived_? And  if it be impossible to assign any, this will serve to confirm our  suspicion. By bringing ideas into so clear a light we may reasonably  hope to remove all dispute, which may arise, concerning their nature and  reality.[1]        [1] It is probable that no more was meant by those, who denied      innate ideas, than that all ideas were copies of our      impressions; though it must be confessed, that the terms, which      they employed, were not chosen with such caution, nor so      exactly defined, as to prevent all mistakes about their      doctrine. For what is meant by _innate_? If innate be      equivalent to natural, then all the perceptions and ideas of      the mind must be allowed to be innate or natural, in whatever      sense we take the latter word, whether in opposition to what is      uncommon, artificial, or miraculous. If by innate be meant,      contemporary to our birth, the dispute seems to be frivolous;      nor is it worth while to enquire at what time thinking begins,      whether before, at, or after our birth. Again, the word _idea_,      seems to be commonly taken in a very loose sense, by LOCKE and      others; as standing for any of our perceptions, our sensations      and passions, as well as thoughts. Now in this sense, I should      desire to know, what can be meant by asserting, that self-love,      or resentment of injuries, or the passion between the sexes is      not innate?        But admitting these terms, _impressions_ and _ideas_, in the      sense above explained, and understanding by _innate_, what is      original or copied from no precedent perception, then may we      assert that all our impressions are innate, and our ideas      not innate.        To be ingenuous, I must own it to be my opinion, that LOCKE was      betrayed into this question by the schoolmen, who, making use      of undefined terms, draw out their disputes to a tedious      length, without ever touching the point in question. A like      ambiguity and circumlocution seem to run through that      philosopher's reasonings on this as well as most other      subjects.        SECTION III.    OF THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS.      18. It is evident that there is a principle of connexion between the  different thoughts or ideas of the mind, and that, in their appearance  to the memory or imagination, they introduce each other with a certain  degree of method and regularity. In our more serious thinking or  discourse this is so observable that any particular thought, which  breaks in upon the regular tract or chain of ideas, is immediately  remarked and rejected. And even in our wildest and most wandering  reveries, nay in our very dreams, we shall find, if we reflect, that the  imagination ran not altogether at adventures, but that there was still a  connexion upheld among the different ideas, which succeeded each other.  Were the loosest and freest conversation to be transcribed, there would  immediately be observed something which connected it in all its  transitions. Or where this is wanting, the person who broke the thread  of discourse might still inform you, that there had secretly revolved in  his mind a succession of thought, which had gradually led him from the  subject of conversation. Among different languages, even where we cannot  suspect the least connexion or communication, it is found, that the  words, expressive of ideas, the most compounded, do yet nearly  correspond to each other: a certain proof that the simple ideas,  comprehended in the compound ones, were bound together by some universal  principle, which had an equal influence on all mankind.    19. Though it be too obvious to escape observation, that different ideas  are connected together; I do not find that any philosopher has attempted  to enumerate or class all the principles of association; a subject,  however, that seems worthy of curiosity. To me, there appear to be only  three principles of connexion among ideas, namely, _Resemblance_,  _Contiguity_ in time or place, and _Cause or Effect_.    That these principles serve to connect ideas will not, I believe, be  much doubted. A picture naturally leads our thoughts to the original[2]:  the mention of one apartment in a building naturally introduces an  enquiry or discourse concerning the others[3]: and if we think of a  wound, we can scarcely forbear reflecting on the pain which follows  it[4]. But that this enumeration is complete, and that there are no  other principles of association except these, may be difficult to prove  to the satisfaction of the reader, or even to a man's own satisfaction.  All we can do, in such cases, is to run over several instances, and  examine carefully the principle which binds the different thoughts to  each other, never stopping till we render the principle as general as  possible[5]. The more instances we examine, and the more care we employ,  the more assurance shall we acquire, that the enumeration, which we form  from the whole, is complete and entire.        [2] Resemblance.        [3] Contiguity.        [4] Cause and effect.        [5] For instance, Contrast or Contrariety is also a connexion      among Ideas: but it may, perhaps, be considered as a mixture of      _Causation_ and _Resemblance_. Where two objects are contrary,      the one destroys the other; that is, the cause of its      annihilation, and the idea of the annihilation of an object,      implies the idea of its former existence.        SECTION IV.    SCEPTICAL DOUBTS CONCERNING THE OPERATIONS OF THE UNDERSTANDING.      PART I.      20. All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided  into two kinds, to wit, _Relations of Ideas_, and _Matters of Fact_. Of  the first kind are the sciences of Geometry, Algebra, and Arithmetic;  and in short, every affirmation which is either intuitively or  demonstratively certain. _That the square of the hypothenuse is equal to  the square of the two sides_, is a proposition which expresses a  relation between these figures. _That three times five is equal to the  half of thirty_, expresses a relation between these numbers.  Propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere operation of  thought, without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the  universe. Though there never were a circle or triangle in nature, the  truths demonstrated by Euclid would for ever retain their certainty  and evidence.    21.
