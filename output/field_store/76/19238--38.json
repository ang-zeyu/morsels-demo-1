It was not a blizzard that descended upon them, though when it came  rolling down from the hilltops it much resembled one. The wind had  changed and brought fog, cold, suffocating, impenetrable. Yet such was  the mood of them that no one said anything about it. Weary had been  about to turn off a couple of men, but did not. What was the use,  since they could not see twenty yards?    For a time they rode aimlessly, Weary in the lead. Then, when it grew  no better but worse, he pulled up, just where a high bank shut off the  wind and a tangle of brush barred the way in front.    \"We may as well camp right here till things loosen up a little,\" he  said. \"There's no use playing blind-man's-buff any longer. We'll have  some fire, for a change. Mama! this is sure beautiful weather!\"    At that, they brightened a bit and hurriedly dismounted and hunted dry  wood. Since they were to have a fire, the general tendency was to have  a big one; so that when they squatted before it and held out cold,  ungloved fingers to the warmth, the flames were leaping high into the  fog and crackling right cheerily. It needed only a few puffs at their  cigarettes to chase the gloom from their faces and put them in the  mood for talk. Only Blink sat apart and stared moodily into the fire,  his hands clasped listlessly around his knees, and to him they gave no  attention. He was an alien, and a taciturn one at that. The Happy  Family were accustomed to living clannishly, even on roundup, and only  when they tacitly adopted a man, as they had adopted Pink and Irish  and, last but not least important, Andy Green, did they take note of  that man's mood and demand reasons for any surliness.    \"If Slim would perk up and go run down a grouse or two,\" Pink observed  pointedly, \"we'd be all right for the day. How about it, Slim?\"    \"Run 'em down yourself,\" Slim retorted. \"By golly, I ain't no lop-ear  bird dog.\"    \"The law's out fer chickens,\" Happy Jack remarked dolefully.    \"Go on, Happy, and get us a few. You've got your howitzer buckled on,\"  fleered Andy Green. Andy it was whose fertile imagination had so  christened Happy Jack's formidable weapon.    \"Aw, gwan!\" protested Happy Jack.    \"Happy looks like he was out for a rep,\" bantered Pink. \"He makes me  think uh the Bad Man in a Western play. All he needs is his hat turned  up in front and his sleeves rolled up to his elbow, like he was  killing hogs. Happy would make a dandy-looking outlaw, with that gun  and that face uh his.\"    \"Say, by golly, I bet that's what he's figurin' on doing. He ain't  going to punch cows no more--I bet he's thinking about turning out.\"    \"Well, when I do, you'll be the first fellow I lay for,\" retorted  Happy, with labored wit.    \"You never'd get a rep shooting at a target the size uh Slim,\" dimpled  Pink. \"Is that toy cannon loaded, Happy?\"    \"I betche yuh dassen't walk off ten paces and let me show yuh,\"  growled Happy.    Pink made as if to rise, then settled back with a sigh. \"Ten paces is  farther than you could drive me from this fire with a club,\" he said.  \"And you couldn't see me, in this fog.\"    \"Say, it _is_ pretty solid,\" said Weary, looking around him at the  blank, gray wall. \"A fellow could sit right here and be a lot ignorant  of what's going on around him. A fellow could--\"    \"When I was riding down in the San Simon basin,\" spoke up Andy,  rolling his second cigarette daintily between his finger-tips, \"I had  a kinda queer experience in a fog, once. It was thick as this one, and  it rolled down just about as sudden and unexpected. That's a plenty  wild patch uh country--or it was when I was there. I was riding for a  Spanish gent that kept white men as a luxury and let the greasers do  about all the rough work--such as killing off superfluous neighbors,  and running brands artistic, and the like. Oh, he was a gay mark, all  right.    \"But about this other deal: I was out riding alone after a little  bunch uh hosses, one day in the fall. I packed my gun and a pair uh  field glasses, and every time I rode up onto a mesa I'd take a long  look at all the lower country to save riding it. I guess I'd  prognosticated around like that for two or three hours, when I come  out on a little pinnacle that slopes down gradual toward a neighbor's  home ranch--only the ranch itself was quite a ride back up the basin.    \"I got off my horse and set down on a rock to build me a smoke, and  was gazing off over the country idle, when I seen a rider come up out  of a little draw and gallop along quartering-like, to pass my pinnacle  on the left. You know how a man out alone like that will watch  anything, from a chicken hawk up in the air to a band uh sheep,  without any interest in either one, but just to have your eyes on  something that's alive and moves.    \"So I watched him, idle, while I smoked. Pretty soon I seen another  fellow ride out into sight where the first one had, and hit her up  lively down the trail. I didn't do no wondering--I just sat and  watched 'em both for want uh something better to do.\"    \"Finding them strays wasn't important, I s'pose?\" Happy Jack  insinuated.    \"It could wait, and did. So I kept an eye on these gazabos, and pretty  soon I saw the hind fellow turn off the trail and go fogging along  behind a little rise. He come into sight again, whipping down both  sides like he was heading a wild four-year-old; and that was queer,  because the only other live thing in sight was man number one, and I  didn't see no reason why he should be hurting himself to get around to  windward like that.    \"Maybe it was five minutes I watched 'em: number one loping along like  there wasn't nothing urgent and he was just merely going somewhere and  taking his time for it, and number two quirting and spurring like  seconds was diamonds.\"    \"I wish they was that valuable to you,\" hinted Pink.    \"They ain't, so take it easy. Well, pretty soon they got closer  together, and then number two unhooked something on his saddle that  caught the light. There's where I got my field glasses into play. I  drew a bead with 'em, and seen right off it was a gun. And I hadn't no  more than got my brain adjusted to grasp his idea, when he puts it  back and takes down his rope. That there,\" Andy added naively,  \"promised more real interest; guns is commonplace.    \"I took down the glasses long enough to size up the layout. Glasses,  you know, are mighty deceiving when it comes to relative distances,  and a hilltop a mile back looks, through the glass, like just stepping  over a ditch. With the naked eye I could see that they were coming  together pretty quick, and they done so.    \"Number one looks back, but whether he seen number two I couldn't say;  seemed to me like he just glanced back casual and in the wrong  direction. Be that is it may, number two edged off a little and rode  in behind a bunch uh mesquite--and then I seen that the trail took a  turn, right there. So he pulled up and stood still till the other one  had ambled past, and then he whirled out into the trail and swung his  loop.    \"When I'd got the glasses focused on 'em again, he had number one  snared, all right, and had took his turns. The hoss he was riding--it  was a buckskin--set back and yanked number one end over end out uh the  saddle, and number one's hoss stampeded off through the brush. Number  two dug in his spurs and went hell-bent off the trail and across  country dragging the other fellow--and him bouncing over the rough  spots something horrible.    \"I don't know what got the matter uh me, then; I couldn't do anything  but sit there on my rock and watch through the glasses. Anyway, while  they looked close enough to hit with a rock, they was off a mile or  more. So while I could see it all I couldn't do nothing to prevent. I  couldn't even hear number one yell--supposing he done any hollering,  which the chances is he did a plenty. It was for all the world like  one uh these moving pictures.    \"I thought it was going to be a case uh dragging to death, but it  wasn't; it looked to me a heap worse. Number two dragged his man a  ways--I reckon till he was plumb helpless--and then he pulled up and  rode back to where he laid. The fellow tried to get up, and did get  partly on his knees--and number one standing over him, watching.    \"What passed I don't know, not having my hearing magnified like my  sight was. I framed it up that number two was getting his past,  present and future read out to him--what I'd call a free life reading.  The rope was pinning his arms down to his sides, and number two was  taking blamed good care there wasn't any slack, so fast as he tried to  get up he was yanked back. From first to last he never had a ghost of  a show.    \"Then number two reaches back deliberate and draws his gun and  commences shooting, and I commences hollering for him to quit it--and  me a mile off and can't do nothing! I tell yuh right now, that was  about the worst deal I ever went up against, to set there on that  pinnacle and watch murder done in cold blood, and me plumb helpless.    \"The first shot wasn't none fatal, as I could see plainer than was  pleasant. Looked to me like he wanted to string out the agony. It was  a clear case uh butchery from start to finish; the damnedest,  lowest-down act a white man could be guilty of. He empties his  six-gun--counting the smoke-puffs--and waits a minute, watching like a  cat does a gopher. I was sweating cold, but I kept my eyes glued to  them glasses like a man in a nightmare.    \"When he makes sure the fellow's dead, he rides alongside and flips  off the rope, with the buckskin snorting and edging off--at the  blood-smell, I reckon. While he's coiling his rope, calm as if he'd  just merely roped a yearling, the buckskin gets his head, plants it  and turns on the fireworks.    \"When"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13678"],[0,"Chapters on Jewish Literature (#5)"],[1,"cademy, which continued  to flourish for nearly eight centuries. He and his great contemporary  Samuel (180-257) enjoy with Jochanan the honor of supplying the leading  materials of which the Talmud consists. Samuel laid down a rule which,  based on an utterance of the prophet Jeremiah, enabled Jews to live and  serve in non-Jewish countries. \"The law of the land is law,\" said  Samuel. But he lived in the realms of the stars as well as in the  streets of his city. Samuel was an astronomer, and he is reported to  have boasted with truth, that \"he was as familiar with the paths of the  stars as with the streets of Nehardea.\" He arranged the Jewish Calendar,  his work in this direction being perfected by Hillel II in the fourth  century. Like Simlai, Rab and Samuel had heathen and Christian friends.  Origen and Jerome read the Scriptures under the guidance of Jews. The  heathen philosopher Porphyry wrote a commentary on the Book of Daniel.  So, too, Abbahu, who lived in Palestine a little later on, frequented  the society of cultivated Romans, and had his family taught Greek.  Abbahu was a manufacturer of veils for women's wear, for, like many  Amoraim, he scorned to make learning a means of living, Abbahu's modesty  with regard to his own merits shows that a Rabbi was not necessarily  arrogant in pride of knowledge! Once Abbahu's lecture was besieged by a  great crowd, but the audience of his colleague Chiya was scanty. \"Thy  teaching,\" said Abbahu to Chiya, \"is a rare jewel, of which only an  expert can judge; mine is tinsel, which attracts every ignorant eye.\"    It was Rab, however, who was the real popularizer of Jewish learning. He  arranged courses of lectures for the people as well as for scholars.  Rab's successor as head of the Sura school, Huna (212-297), completed  Rab's work in making Babylonia the chief centre of Jewish learning. Huna  tilled his own fields for a living, and might often be met going home  with his spade over his shoulder. It was men like this who built up the  Jewish tradition. Huna's predecessor, however, had wider experience of  life, for Rab had been a student in Palestine, and was in touch with the  Jews of many parts. From Rab's time onwards, learning became the  property of the whole people, and the Talmud, besides being the  literature of the Jewish universities, may be called the book of the  masses. It contains, not only the legal and ethical results of the  investigations of the learned, but also the wisdom and superstition of  the masses. The Talmud is not exactly a national literature, but it was  a unique bond between the scattered Jews, an unparallelled spiritual and  literary instrument for maintaining the identity of Judaism amid the  many tribulations to which the Jews were subjected.    The Talmud owed much to many minds. Externally it was influenced by the  nations with which the Jews came into contact. From the inside, the  influences at work were equally various. Jochanan, Rab, and Samuel in  the third century prepared the material out of which the Talmud was  finally built. The actual building was done by scholars in the fourth  century. Rabba, the son of Nachmani (270-330), Abayi (280-338), and Rava  (299-352) gave the finishing touches to the method of the Talmud. Rabba  was a man of the people; he was a clear thinker, and loved to attract  all comers by an apt anecdote. Rava had a superior sense of his own  dignity, and rather neglected the needs of the ordinary man of his day.  Abayi was more of the type of the average Rabbi, acute, genial,  self-denying. Under the impulse of men of the most various gifts of mind  and heart, the Talmud was gradually constructed, but two names are  prominently associated with its actual compilation. These were Ashi  (352-427) and Rabina (died 499). Ashi combined massive learning with  keen logical ingenuity. He needed both for the task to which he devoted  half a century of his life. He possessed a vast memory, in which the  accumulated tradition of six centuries was stored, and he was gifted  with the mental orderliness which empowered him to deal with this  bewildering mass of materials.    It is hardly possible that after the compilation of the Talmud it  remained an oral book, though it must be remembered that memory played a  much greater part in earlier centuries than it does now. At all events,  Ashi, and after him Rabina, performed the great work of systematizing  the Rabbinical literature at a turning-point in the world's history. The  Mishnah had been begun at a moment when the Roman empire was at its  greatest vigor and glory; the Talmud was completed at the time when the  Roman empire was in its decay. That the Jews were saved from similar  disintegration, was due very largely to the Talmud. The Talmud is thus  one of the great books of the world. Despite its faults, its excessive  casuistry, its lack of style and form, its stupendous mass of detailed  laws and restrictions, it is nevertheless a great book in and for  itself. It is impossible to consider it further here in its religious  aspects. But something must be said in the next chapter of that side of  the Rabbinical literature known as the _Midrash_.

CHAPTER IV    THE MIDRASH AND ITS POETRY        Mechilta, Sifra, Sifre, Pesikta, Tanchuma, Midrash      Rabbah, Yalkut.--Proverbs.--Parables.--Fables.      In its earliest forms identical with the Halachah, or the practical and  legal aspects of the Mishnah and the Talmud, the Midrash, in its fuller  development, became an independent branch of Rabbinical literature. Like  the Talmud, the Midrash is of a composite nature, and under the one name  the accumulations of ages are included. Some of its contents are earlier  than the completion of the Bible, others were collected and even created  as recently as the tenth or the eleventh century of the current era.    Midrash (\"Study,\" \"Inquiry\") was in the first instance an _Explanation  of the Scriptures_. This explanation is often the clear, natural  exposition of the text, and it enforces rules of conduct both ethical  and ritual. The historical and moral traditions which clustered round  the incidents and characters of the Bible soon received a more vivid  setting. The poetical sense of the Rabbis expressed itself in a vast and  beautiful array of legendary additions to the Bible, but the additions  are always devised with a moral purpose, to give point to a preacher's  homily or to inspire the imagination of the audience with nobler  fancies. Besides being expository, the Midrash is, therefore, didactic  and poetical, the moral being conveyed in the guise of a _narrative_,  amplifying and developing the contents of Scripture. The Midrash gives  the results of that deep searching of the Scriptures which became second  nature with the Jews, and it also represents the changes and expansions  of ethical and theological ideals as applied to a changing and growing  life.    From another point of view, also, the Midrash is a poetical literature.  Its function as a species of _popular homiletics_ made it necessary to  appeal to the emotions. In its warm and living application of abstract  truths to daily ends, in its responsive and hopeful intensification of  the nearness of God to Israel, in its idealization of the past and  future of the Jews, it employed the poet's art in essence, though not in  form. It will be seen later on that in another sense the Midrash is a  poetical literature, using the lore of the folk, the parable, the  proverb, the allegory, and the fable, and often using them in the  language of poetry.    The oldest Midrash is the actual report of sermons and addresses of the  Tannaite age; the latest is a medieval compilation from all extant  sources. The works to which the name Midrash is applied are the  _Mechilta_ (to Exodus); the _Sifra_ (to Leviticus); the _Sifre_ (to  Numbers and Deuteronomy); the _Pesikta_ (to various _Sections_ of the  Bible, whence its name); the _Tanchuma_ (to the Pentateuch); the  _Midrash Rabbah_ (the \"Great Midrash,\" to the Pentateuch and the Five  Scrolls of Esther, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of  Songs); and the _Midrash Haggadol_ (identical in name, and in contents  similar to, but not identical with, the _Midrash Rabbah_); together with  a large number of collected Midrashim, such as the _Yalkut_, and a host  of smaller works, several of which are no"]]]
