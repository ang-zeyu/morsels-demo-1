Those first two weeks in the  new land, in the month of May, 1769, were never to be forgotten. Of  about ninety sailors, soldiers, and mechanics, less than thirty  survived; over sixty were buried by the wash of the waves of the Bay of  Saint James.    Then came Rivera and Crespi, with Lieutenant Fages and twenty-five  soldiers.    Immediately a permanent camp was sought and found at what is now known  as Old San Diego, where the two old palms still remain, with the ruins  of the _presidio_ on the hill behind. Six weeks were busily occupied in  caring for the sick and in unloading the \"San Antonio.\" Then the fourth  and last party of the explorers arrived,--Governor Portola on June 29,  and Serra on July 1. What a journey that had been for Serra! He had  walked all the way, and, after two days out, a badly ulcerated leg began  to trouble him. Portola wished to send him back, but Serra would not  consent. He called to one of the muleteers and asked him to make just  such a salve for his wound as he would put upon the saddle galls of one  of his animals. It was done, and in a single night the ointment and the  Father's prayers worked the miracle of healing.    After a general thanksgiving, in which exploding gunpowder was used to  give effect, a consultation was held, at which it was decided to send  back the \"San Antonio\" to San Blas for supplies, and for new crews for  herself and the \"San Carlos.\" A land expedition under Portola was to go  to Monterey, while Serra and others remained at San Diego to found the  Mission. The vessel sailed, Portola and his band started north, and on  July 16, 1769, Serra raised the cross, blessed it, said mass, preached,  and formally established the Mission of San Diego de Alcala.    It mattered not that the Indians held aloof; that only the people who  came on the expedition were present to hear. From the hills beyond,  doubtless, peered and peeped the curious natives. All was mysterious to  them. Later, however, they became troublesome, stealing from the sick  and pillaging from the \"San Carlos.\" At last, they made a determined  raid for plunder, which the Spanish soldiers resisted. A flight of  arrows was the result. A boy was killed and three of the new-comers  wounded. A volley of musket-balls killed three Indians, wounded several  more, and cleared the settlement. After such an introduction, there is  no wonder that conversions were slow. Not a neophyte gladdened the  Father's heart for more than a year.        CHAPTER III    THE MISSIONS FOUNDED BY PADRE JUNIPERO SERRA    San Diego Mission founded, Serra was impatient to have work begun  elsewhere. Urging the governor to go north immediately, he rejoiced when  Portola, Crespi, Rivera, and Pages started, with a band of soldiers and  natives. They set out gaily, gladly. They were sure of a speedy journey  to the Bay of Monterey, discovered by Cabrillo, and seen again and  charted by Vizcaino, where they were to establish the second Mission.    [Illustration: EASTER SUNRISE SERVICE, 1913, UNDER SERRA CROSS, MT.  RUBIDOUX, RIVERSIDE, CALIF.]    [Illustration: MEMORIAL TABLET AND GRAVES OF PADRES SERRA, CRESPI, AND  LASUEN, IN MISSION SAN CARLOS BORROMEO, CARMEL VALLEY, MONTEREY.]    Strange to say, however, when they reached Monterey, in the words of  Scripture, \"their eyes were holden,\" and they did not recognize it. They  found a bay which they fully described, and while we to-day clearly see  that it was the bay they were looking for, they themselves thought it  was another one. Believing that Vizcaino had made an error in his chart,  they pushed on further north. The result of this disappointment was of  vast consequence to the later development of California, for, following  the coast line inland, they were bound to strike the peninsula and  ultimately reach the shores of what is now San Francisco Bay. This  was exactly what was done, and on November 2, 1769, one of Portola's  men, ascending ahead of the others to the crest of a hill, caught sight  of this hitherto unknown and hidden body of water. How he would have  shouted had he understood! How thankful and joyous it would have made  Portola and Crespi and the others. For now was the discovery of that  very harbor that Padre Serra had so fervently hoped and prayed for, the  harbor that was to secure for California a Mission \"for our father Saint  Francis.\" Yet not one of them either knew or seemed to comprehend the  importance of that which their eyes had seen. Instead, they were  disheartened and disappointed by a new and unforeseen obstacle to their  further progress. The narrow channel (later called the Golden Gate by  Fremont), barred their way, and as their provisions were getting low,  and they certainly were much further north than they ought to have been  to find the Bay of Monterey, Portola gave the order for the return, and  sadly, despondently, they went back to San Diego.    On the march south, Portola's mind was made up. This whole enterprise  was foolish and chimerical. He had had enough of it. He was going back  home, and as the \"San Antonio\" with its promised supplies had not yet  arrived, and the camp was almost entirely out of food, he announced the  abandonment of the expedition and an immediate return to Lower  California.    Now came Serra's faith to the fore, and that resolute determination and  courage that so marked his life. The decision of Portola had gone to his  heart like an arrow. What! Abandon the Missions before they were fairly  begun? Where was their trust in God? It was one hundred and sixty-six  years since Vizcaino had been in this port, and if they left it now,  when would another expedition be sent? In those years that had elapsed  since Vizcaino, how many precious Indian souls had been lost because  they had not received the message of salvation? He pleaded and begged  Portola to reconsider. For awhile the governor stood firm. Serra also  had a strong will. From a letter written to Padre Palou, who was left  behind in charge of the Lower California Missions, we see his intention:  \"_If we see that along with the provisions hope vanishes, I shall remain  alone_ with Father Juan Crespi and hold out to the last breath.\"    With such a resolution as this, Portola could not cope. Yielding to  Serra's persuasion, he consented to wait while a _novena_ (a nine days'  devotional exercise) was made to St. Joseph, the holy patron of the  expedition. Fervently day by day Serra prayed. On the day of San Jose  (St. Joseph) a high mass was celebrated, and Serra preached. On the  fourth day the eager watchers saw the vessel approach. Then, strange to  say, it disappeared, and as the sixth, seventh and eighth days passed  and it did not reappear again, hope seemed to sink lower in the hearts  of all but Serra and his devoted brother Crespi. On the ninth and last  day--would it be seen? Bowing himself in eager and earnest prayer Serra  pleaded that his faith be not shamed, and, to his intense delight,  doubtless while he prayed, the vessel sailed into the bay.    Joy unspeakable was felt by every one. The provisions were here, the  expedition need not be abandoned; the Indians would yet be converted to  Holy Church and all was well. A service of thanksgiving was held, and  happiness smiled on every face.    With new energy, vigor, and hope, Portola set out again for the search  of Monterey, accompanied by Serra as well as Crespi. This time the  attempt was successful. They recognized the bay, and on June 3, 1770, a  shelter of branches was erected on the beach, a cross made ready near an  old oak, the bells were hung and blessed, and the services of founding  began. Padre Serra preached with his usual fervor; he exhorted the  natives to come and be saved, and put to rout all infernal foes by an  abundant sprinkling of holy water. The Mission was dedicated to San  Carlos Borromeo.    Thus two of the long desired Missions were established, and the passion  of Serra's longings, instead of being assuaged, raged now all the  fiercer. It was not long, however, before he found it to be bad policy  to have the Missions for the Indian neophytes too near the _presidio_,  or barracks for the soldiers. These latter could not always be  controlled, and they early began a course which was utterly demoralizing  to both sexes, for the women of a people cannot be debauched without  exciting the men to fierce anger, or making them as bad as their women.  Hence Serra removed the Missions: that of San Diego six miles up the  valley to a point where the ruins now stand, while that of San Carlos he  re-established in the Carmelo Valley.    The Mission next to be established should have been San Buenaventura,  but events stood in the way; so, on July 14, 1771, Serra (who had been  zealously laboring with the heathen near Monterey), with eight soldiers,  three sailors, and a few Indians, passed down the Salinas River and  established the Mission of San Antonio de Padua. The site was a  beautiful one, in an oak-studded glen, near a fair-sized stream. The  passionate enthusiasm of Serra can be understood from the fact that  after the bells were hung from a tree, he loudly tolled them, crying the  while like one possessed: \"Come, gentiles, come to the Holy Church, come  and receive the faith of Jesus Christ!\" Padre Pieras could not help  reminding his superior that not an Indian was within sight or hearing,  and that it would be more practical to proceed with the ritual. One  native, however, did witness the ceremony, and he soon brought a large  number of his companions, who became tractable enough to help in  erecting the rude church, barracks and houses with which the priests and  soldiers were compelled to be content in those early days.    [Illustration: MISSION SAN CARLOS AND BAY OF MONTEREY.]    [Illustration: JUNIPERO OAK, SAN CARLOS PRESIDIO MISSION, MONTEREY]    [Illustration: STATUE OF SAN"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13858"],[0,"The Laws Of War, Affecting Commerce And Shipping (#5)"],[1,"(as instruments of  trade with the enemy,) are not so far void that they may not  constitute the basis of a promise by which a party may bind himself on  the return of peace.[41]    [Sidenote: Contracts made before the War.]    On the very important question of the effect of a declaration on  Contracts with the subjects or the enemy, _entered into previous to  the War_, the rule is, that if the performance of the contract be  rendered unlawful by the Government of the country, the contract is  dissolved on both sides.[42]    Thus the contract of Affreightment is dissolved when the voyage  becomes unlawful, by the commencement of war, or the interdiction of  commerce;[43] and this whether the interdiction is complete as to the  ship, or partial as to the receiving of goods.    Similarly, if the voyage be broken up by Capture on the passage, so as  to cause a _complete defeat_ of the undertaking, the contract is  dissolved, notwithstanding a recapture.[44]    A Blockade of the port of destination, that renders the delivery of  the cargo impossible, and obliges the ship to return to its port of  destination, dissolves the contract.[45]    A temporary interruption of the voyage does not put an end to the  agreement. Embargoes, hostile blockades, and investments of the port  of departure are held to be temporary impediments only.[46]    But in the case of an Embargo imposed by the government of the  country, of which the merchant is a subject, in the nature of  reprisals and partial hostility, against the enemy to which the ship  belongs, the merchant may put an end to the contract, if the object of  the voyage is likely to be defeated thereby; as if, for example, the  cargo were of a perishable nature.[47]    [Sidenote: Partnerships.]    A Public War operates as a positive dissolution of Partnerships  between subjects of the contending nations. Every Partnership is  dissolved by the extinction of the business for which it was  formed.[48] By a declaration of War, the respective subjects of each  country become positive enemies to each other. They can carry on no  commercial or other intercourse with each other; they can make no  valid contracts with each other; they can institute no suits in the  courts of either country; they can, properly speaking, hold no  communication of an amicable nature, with each other; and their  property is mutually liable to capture and confiscation by the  subjects of the other country. The whole objects and ends of the  Partnership, the application of the joint funds, skill, labour, and  enterprize of all the Partners of the common business, can no longer  be attained.[49]    Thus a Partnership between alien friends, is at once defeated when  they become alien enemies.    This dissolution, however, only has respect to the future. The parties  remain bound for all antecedent engagements. The partnership may be  said to continue as to everything that is past, and until all  pre-existing matters are wound up and settled. With regard to things  past, the partnership continues, and must always continue.    No notice is necessary to the world to complete the dissolution of the  association. Notice is requisite when a partnership is dissolved by  the act of the parties, but it is not necessary when the dissolution  takes place by the act of law. All mankind are bound to take notice of  the War, and its consequences. Besides, any special notice would be  useless unless joint, and as the partners could hold no lawful  intercourse, a lawful joint notice is impossible.    It must not be supposed that peace will have any healing effect, to  restore the parties to their rights; the co-partnership being once  dissolved by the war, it was extinguished for ever, except as to  matters existing prior to the war.[50]    With regard to the effect of war upon partnerships, where the partners  are severally subjects of the belligerent powers. According to Mr.  Justice Story,         \"this point does not seem to have been discussed in our       courts of justice until a recent period; yet it would seem       to be a necessary result of principles of public law, well       established and defined. By a declaration of war, the       respective subjects of each country become positive enemies       of each other. They can carry on no commercial or other       intercourse with each other; they can make no valid       contracts with each other; they can institute no suits in       the courts of either country; they can, properly speaking,       hold no communication of an amicable nature with each other;       and their property is mutually liable to capture and       confiscation, by the subjects of either country. Now, it is       obvious from these considerations, that the whole ends and       objects of the partnership, the application of the joint       funds, skill, labours, and enterprize, of all the partners       in the common business thereof, can no longer be attained.       The conclusion therefore, would seem to be absolutely that       this mutual supervening capacity, must, upon the very       principles applied to all analagous cases, amount to a       positive dissolution of the partnership.\"[51]    The law of nations has not even stopped at the points already stated;  it proceeds further. The question of enemy or no enemy, depends not  upon the natural allegiance of the partners, but upon their domicile.    [Sidenote: Partnerships.]    If a partnership is established, and as it were domiciled, in a  neutral country, and all the partners reside there, it is treated as a  neutral establishment, and is entitled to protection accordingly. But  if one or more of the partners is domiciled in an enemy's country, he  or they are treated personally as enemies, and his share of the  partnership property is liable to capture and condemnation  accordingly, even though the partnership establishment is in the  neutral country. The inference from these considerations is, that in  all these cases there is an utter incompatibility from operation of  law between the partners, as to their respective rights, duties, and  obligations, both public and private; and therefore, that a  dissolution must necessarily result therefrom, independent of the will  or acts of the parties.[52]    And, as a general rule, therefore, it may be laid down, that if the  performance of a covenant be rendered unlawful by the Government of  this country entering into war, the contract will be dissolved on both  sides, and the offending party, as he has been compelled to abandon  his contract, will be excused from the payment of damages for its  non-performance; but it is otherwise, if the non-performance is  prevented only by the prohibition of a foreign country.[53]    In such cases, the remedy only is suspended; and other cases may occur  on these principles, where, from other circumstances, the remedy only  is suspended until the termination of the war; as for example, in most  cases of executed contracts.    [Sidenote: Trading with the Enemy punishable.]    Trading with the Enemy, was at an early period an indictable offence  in the English Court of Admiralty.[54] And in the time of King  William, it was held to be a misdemeanor at common law, to carry corn  to an enemy.[55]    The law, as I have faintly sketched it out, is founded to some extent  on American authorities, where the question has been as fully  discussed as in the reports of this country; but there can be little  doubt that the law is the same in this country: although a doubt was  once thrown on it, by the strong political opinion of Lord Mansfield,  as to the policy of allowing trade with an enemy, or assuring an  enemy's property. The lustre of his talents, and his ascendancy in the  Court of King's Bench, were calculated to continue the delusion.  During his time, the question as to the _legality_ of such insurances  was never mooted; for he frowned on every attempt to set up such a  defence, as dishonest and against good faith.[56]    The strict rule of interdicted intercourse has been carried so far in  the British Admiralty, as to prohibit supplies to a British Colony  during its partial subjection to the enemy, and when the Colony was in  want of provisions.[57]    [Sidenote: Cartel Ships]    The same interdiction to trade applies to Cartel Ships, or Ships of  Truce, that is, to Ships sent to recover prisoners of war; and there  is but one exception to this rigorous rule of International Law;--the  case of Ransom Bills, which are contracts of necessity, founded on a  state of war.          SECTION II.        _On Enemies and Hostile Property_.      During a peace of thirty-nine years, there has naturally arisen a vast  inter-immigration throughout Europe; many complicated commercial and  family relations have sprung up between nations of different  countries; many Englishmen are permanently settled in various parts of  Europe; and England, in return, is crowded with Foreigners, who look  upon this country as their present and future home. What is the  position of these persons at the commencement of war? Who, in fact,  are our enemies?    And the previous Section, in which the effect of War on Commercial  Relations has been sketched out, must have made it quite evident that  it has become important accurately to determine what relations and  circumstances impress a hostile character upon persons and property.  According to Chancellor Kent, \"the modern International Law of the  Commercial World is replete with refined and complicated distinctions  on this point.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Alien Enemies]    A man is said to be permanently an Alien Enemy, when he owes a  permanent allegiance to the adverse belligerent, and his hostility is  commensurate in point of time with his country's quarrel. But he who  does not owe a permanent allegiance to the enemy, is an enemy only  during the existence and continuance of certain"]]]
