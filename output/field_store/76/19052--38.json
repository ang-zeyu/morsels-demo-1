But if thou knowest him, my jolly blade, wilt thou go  with me and bring me to him? Fourscore bright angels hath the Sheriff  promised me if I serve the warrant upon the knave's body, and ten of  them will I give to thee if thou showest me him.\"    \"Ay, that will I,\" quoth Robin, \"but show me thy warrant, man, until I  see whether it be good or no.\"    \"That will I not do, even to mine own brother,\" answered the Tinker.  \"No man shall see my warrant till I serve it upon yon fellow's own  body.\"    \"So be it,\" quoth Robin.  \"And thou show it not to me I know not to whom  thou wilt show it.  But here we are at the Sign of the Blue Boar, so let  us in and taste his brown October.\"    No sweeter inn could be found in all Nottinghamshire than that of the  Blue Boar.  None had such lovely trees standing around, or was so  covered with trailing clematis and sweet woodbine; none had such good  beer and such humming ale; nor, in wintertime, when the north wind  howled and snow drifted around the hedges, was there to be found,  elsewhere, such a roaring fire as blazed upon the hearth of the Blue  Boar.  At such times might be found a goodly company of yeomen or  country folk seated around the blazing hearth, bandying merry jests,  while roasted crabs[Small sour apples] bobbed in bowls of ale upon the  hearthstone. Well known was the inn to Robin Hood and his band, for  there had he and such merry companions as Little John or Will Stutely or  young David of Doncaster often gathered when all the forest was filled  with snow. As for mine host, he knew how to keep a still tongue in his  head, and to swallow his words before they passed his teeth, for he knew  very well which side of his bread was spread with butter, for Robin and  his band were the best of customers and paid their scores without having  them chalked up behind the door. So now, when Robin Hood and the Tinker  came thereto and called aloud for two great pots of ale, none would have  known from look or speech that the host had ever set eyes upon the  outlaw before.    \"Bide thou here,\" quoth Robin to the Tinker, \"while I go and see that  mine host draweth ale from the right butt, for he hath good October, I  know, and that brewed by Withold of Tamworth.\"  So saying, he went  within and whispered to the host to add a measure of Flemish strong  waters to the good English ale; which the latter did and brought it to  them.    \"By Our Lady,\" said the Tinker, after a long draught of the ale, \"yon  same Withold of Tamworth--a right good Saxon name, too, I would have  thee know--breweth the most humming ale that e'er passed the lips of Wat  o' the Crabstaff.\"    \"Drink, man, drink,\" cried Robin, only wetting his own lips meanwhile.  \"Ho, landlord!  Bring my friend another pot of the same. And now for a  song, my jolly blade.\"    \"Ay, that will I give thee a song, my lovely fellow,\" quoth the Tinker,  \"for I never tasted such ale in all my days before. By Our Lady, it doth  make my head hum even now!  Hey, Dame Hostess, come listen, an thou  wouldst hear a song, and thou too, thou bonny lass, for never sing I so  well as when bright eyes do look upon me the while.\"    Then he sang an ancient ballad of the time of good King Arthur, called  \"The Marriage of Sir Gawaine,\" which you may some time read yourself, in  stout English of early times; and as he sang, all listened to that noble  tale of noble knight and his sacrifice to his king. But long before the  Tinker came to the last verse his tongue began to trip and his head to  spin, because of the strong waters mixed with the ale. First his tongue  tripped, then it grew thick of sound; then his head wagged from side to  side, until at last he fell asleep as though he never would waken again.    Then Robin Hood laughed aloud and quickly took the warrant from out the  Tinker's pouch with his deft fingers. \"Sly art thou, Tinker,\" quoth he,  \"but not yet, I bow, art thou as sly as that same sly thief Robin Hood.\"    Then he called the host to him and said, \"Here, good man, are ten broad  shillings for the entertainment thou hast given us this day. See that  thou takest good care of thy fair guest there, and when he wakes thou  mayst again charge him ten shillings also, and if he hath it not, thou  mayst take his bag and hammer, and even his coat, in payment. Thus do I  punish those that come into the greenwood to deal dole to me. As for  thine own self, never knew I landlord yet that would not charge twice an  he could.\"    At this the host smiled slyly, as though saying to himself the rustic  saw, \"Teach a magpie to suck eggs.\"    The Tinker slept until the afternoon drew to a close and the shadows  grew long beside the woodland edge, then he awoke. First he looked up,  then he looked down, then he looked east, then he looked west, for he  was gathering his wits together, like barley straws blown apart by the  wind. First he thought of his merry companion, but he was gone. Then he  thought of his stout crabstaff, and that he had within his hand.  Then  of his warrant, and of the fourscore angels he was to gain for serving  it upon Robin Hood.  He thrust his hand into his pouch, but not a scrap  nor a farthing was there. Then he sprang to his feet in a rage.    \"Ho, landlord!\" cried he, \"whither hath that knave gone that was with me  but now?\"    \"What knave meaneth Your Worship?\" quoth the landlord, calling the  Tinker Worship to soothe him, as a man would pour oil upon angry water.  \"I saw no knave with Your Worship, for I swear no man would dare call  that man knave so nigh to Sherwood Forest.  A right stout yeoman I saw  with Your Worship, but I thought that Your Worship knew him, for few  there be about here that pass him by and know him not.\"    \"Now, how should I, that ne'er have squealed in your sty, know all the  swine therein?  Who was he, then, an thou knowest him so well?\"    \"Why, yon same is a right stout fellow whom men hereabouts do call Robin  Hood, which same--\"    \"Now, by'r Lady!\" cried the Tinker hastily, and in a deep voice like an  angry bull, \"thou didst see me come into thine inn, I, a staunch, honest  craftsman, and never told me who my company was, well knowing thine own  self who he was.  Now, I have a right round piece of a mind to crack thy  knave's pate for thee!\" Then he took up his cudgel and looked at the  landlord as though he would smite him where he stood.    \"Nay,\" cried the host, throwing up his elbow, for he feared the blow,  \"how knew I that thou knewest him not?\"    \"Well and truly thankful mayst thou be,\" quoth the Tinker, \"that I be a  patient man and so do spare thy bald crown, else wouldst thou ne'er  cheat customer again.  But as for this same knave Robin Hood, I go  straightway to seek him, and if I do not score his knave's pate, cut my  staff into fagots and call me woman.\" So saying, he gathered himself  together to depart.    \"Nay,\" quoth the landlord, standing in front of him and holding out his  arms like a gooseherd driving his flock, for money made him bold, \"thou  goest not till thou hast paid me my score.\"    \"But did not he pay thee?\"    \"Not so much as one farthing; and ten good shillings' worth of ale have  ye drunk this day.  Nay, I say, thou goest not away without paying me,  else shall our good Sheriff know of it.\"    \"But nought have I to pay thee with, good fellow,\" quoth the Tinker.    \"'Good fellow' not me,\" said the landlord. \"Good fellow am I not when  it cometh to lose ten shillings! Pay me that thou owest me in broad  money, or else leave thy coat and bag and hammer; yet, I wot they are  not worth ten shillings, and I shall lose thereby.  Nay, an thou  stirrest, I have a great dog within and I will loose him upon thee.  Maken, open thou the door and let forth Brian if this fellow stirs one  step.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth the Tinker--for, by roaming the country, he had learned  what dogs were--\"take thou what thou wilt have, and let me depart in  peace, and may a murrain go with thee. But oh, landlord!  An I catch yon  scurvy varlet, I swear he shall pay full with usury for that he hath  had!\"    So saying, he strode away toward the forest, talking to himself, while  the landlord and his worthy dame and Maken stood looking after him, and  laughed when he had fairly gone.    \"Robin and I stripped yon ass of his pack main neatly,\" quoth the  landlord.    Now it happened about this time that Robin Hood was going through the  forest to Fosse Way, to see what was to be seen there, for the moon was  full and the night gave promise of being bright.  In his hand he carried  his stout oaken staff, and at his side hung his bugle horn.  As thus he  walked up a forest path, whistling, down another path came the Tinker,  muttering to himself and shaking his head like an angry bull; and so, at  a sudden bend, they met sharply face to face. Each stood still for a  time, and then Robin spoke:    \"Halloa, my sweet bird,\" said he, laughing merrily, \"how likest thou  thine ale?  Wilt not sing to me another song?\"    The Tinker said nothing at first but stood looking at Robin with a grim  face. \"Now,\" quoth he at last, \"I am right glad I have met thee, and if  I do not rattle thy bones within thy hide this day, I give thee leave to  put thy foot upon my neck.\"    \"With all my heart,\" cried merry Robin.  \"Rattle my bones, an thou  canst.\" So saying, he gripped his staff and threw himself upon his  guard. Then the Tinker spat upon his hands and, grasping his staff, came  straight at the other.  He struck two or three blows, but soon found  that he had met his match, for Robin warded and parried all of them,  and, before the Tinker thought, he gave him a rap upon the ribs in  return.  At this Robin laughed aloud, and the Tinker grew more angry  than ever, and smote again "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#5)"],[1,"was not far off, and sufficiently illustrated the  condition of its unfortunate and self-abandoned occupants. Fancy to  yourself a little swift stream, working its devious way down a woody  valley; sometimes wholly hidden under logs and fallen trees, sometimes  issuing forth and spreading into a broad, clear pool; and on its banks  in little nooks cleared away among the trees, miniature log-houses  in utter ruin and neglect. A labyrinth of narrow, obstructed paths  connected these habitations one with another. Sometimes we met a stray  calf, a pig or a pony, belonging to some of the villagers, who usually  lay in the sun in front of their dwellings, and looked on us with cold,  suspicious eyes as we approached. Farther on, in place of the log-huts  of the Kickapoos, we found the pukwi lodges of their neighbors, the  Pottawattamies, whose condition seemed no better than theirs.    Growing tired at last, and exhausted by the excessive heat and  sultriness of the day, we returned to our friend, the trader. By this  time the crowd around him had dispersed, and left him at leisure. He  invited us to his cottage, a little white-and-green building, in  the style of the old French settlements; and ushered us into a neat,  well-furnished room. The blinds were closed, and the heat and glare  of the sun excluded; the room was as cool as a cavern. It was neatly  carpeted too and furnished in a manner that we hardly expected on the  frontier. The sofas, chairs, tables, and a well-filled bookcase would  not have disgraced an Eastern city; though there were one or two little  tokens that indicated the rather questionable civilization of the  region. A pistol, loaded and capped, lay on the mantelpiece; and through  the glass of the bookcase, peeping above the works of John Milton  glittered the handle of a very mischievous-looking knife.    Our host went out, and returned with iced water, glasses, and a bottle  of excellent claret; a refreshment most welcome in the extreme heat of  the day; and soon after appeared a merry, laughing woman, who must have  been, a year of two before, a very rich and luxuriant specimen of Creole  beauty. She came to say that lunch was ready in the next room. Our  hostess evidently lived on the sunny side of life, and troubled herself  with none of its cares. She sat down and entertained us while we were  at table with anecdotes of fishing parties, frolics, and the officers  at the fort. Taking leave at length of the hospitable trader and his  friend, we rode back to the garrison.    Shaw passed on to the camp, while I remained to call upon Colonel  Kearny. I found him still at table. There sat our friend the captain,  in the same remarkable habiliments in which we saw him at Westport; the  black pipe, however, being for the present laid aside. He dangled  his little cap in his hand and talked of steeple-chases, touching  occasionally upon his anticipated exploits in buffalo-hunting. There,  too, was R., somewhat more elegantly attired. For the last time we  tasted the luxuries of civilization, and drank adieus to it in wine good  enough to make us almost regret the leave-taking. Then, mounting,  we rode together to the camp, where everything was in readiness for  departure on the morrow.        CHAPTER IV    \"JUMPING OFF\"      The reader need not be told that John Bull never leaves home without  encumbering himself with the greatest possible load of luggage. Our  companions were no exception to the rule. They had a wagon drawn by six  mules and crammed with provisions for six months, besides ammunition  enough for a regiment; spare rifles and fowling-pieces, ropes and  harness; personal baggage, and a miscellaneous assortment of articles,  which produced infinite embarrassment on the journey. They had also  decorated their persons with telescopes and portable compasses, and  carried English double-barreled rifles of sixteen to the pound caliber,  slung to their saddles in dragoon fashion.    By sunrise on the 23d of May we had breakfasted; the tents were leveled,  the animals saddled and harnessed, and all was prepared. \"Avance donc!  get up!\" cried Delorier from his seat in front of the cart. Wright,  our friend's muleteer, after some swearing and lashing, got his  insubordinate train in motion, and then the whole party filed from the  ground. Thus we bade a long adieu to bed and board, and the principles  of Blackstone's Commentaries. The day was a most auspicious one; and yet  Shaw and I felt certain misgivings, which in the sequel proved but too  well founded. We had just learned that though R. had taken it upon him  to adopt this course without consulting us, not a single man in  the party was acquainted with it; and the absurdity of our friend's  high-handed measure very soon became manifest. His plan was to strike  the trail of several companies of dragoons, who last summer had made an  expedition under Colonel Kearny to Fort Laramie, and by this means to  reach the grand trail of the Oregon emigrants up the Platte.    We rode for an hour or two when a familiar cluster of buildings appeared  on a little hill. \"Hallo!\" shouted the Kickapoo trader from over his  fence. \"Where are you going?\" A few rather emphatic exclamations might  have been heard among us, when we found that we had gone miles out of  our way, and were not advanced an inch toward the Rocky Mountains. So  we turned in the direction the trader indicated, and with the sun for  a guide, began to trace a \"bee line\" across the prairies. We struggled  through copses and lines of wood; we waded brooks and pools of water; we  traversed prairies as green as an emerald, expanding before us for mile  after mile; wider and more wild than the wastes Mazeppa rode over:         \"Man nor brute,       Nor dint of hoof, nor print of foot,       Lay in the wild luxuriant soil;       No sign of travel; none of toil;       The very air was mute.\"    Riding in advance, we passed over one of these great plains; we looked  back and saw the line of scattered horsemen stretching for a mile or  more; and far in the rear against the horizon, the white wagons creeping  slowly along. \"Here we are at last!\" shouted the captain. And in truth  we had struck upon the traces of a large body of horse. We turned  joyfully and followed this new course, with tempers somewhat improved;  and toward sunset encamped on a high swell of the prairie, at the foot  of which a lazy stream soaked along through clumps of rank grass. It  was getting dark. We turned the horses loose to feed. \"Drive down the  tent-pickets hard,\" said Henry Chatillon, \"it is going to blow.\" We did  so, and secured the tent as well as we could; for the sky had changed  totally, and a fresh damp smell in the wind warned us that a stormy  night was likely to succeed the hot clear day. The prairie also wore  a new aspect, and its vast swells had grown black and somber under the  shadow of the clouds. The thunder soon began to growl at a distance.  Picketing and hobbling the horses among the rich grass at the foot of  the slope, where we encamped, we gained a shelter just as the rain began  to fall; and sat at the opening of the tent, watching the proceedings of  the captain. In defiance of the rain he was stalking among the horses,  wrapped in an old Scotch plaid. An extreme solicitude tormented him,  lest some of his favorites should escape, or some accident should befall  them; and he cast an anxious eye toward three wolves who were sneaking  along over the dreary surface of the plain, as if he dreaded some  hostile demonstration on their part.    On the next morning we had gone but a mile or two, when we came to an  extensive belt of woods, through the midst of which ran a stream, wide,  deep, and of an appearance particularly muddy and treacherous. Delorier  was in advance with his cart; he jerked his pipe from his mouth, lashed  his mules, and poured forth a volley of Canadian ejaculations. In  plunged the cart, but midway it stuck fast. Delorier leaped out  knee-deep in water, and by dint of sacres and a vigorous application of  the whip, he urged the mules out of the slough. Then approached the long  team and heavy wagon of our friends; but it paused on the brink.    \"Now my advice is--\" began the captain, who had been anxiously  contemplating the muddy gulf.    \"Drive on!\" cried R.    But Wright, the muleteer, apparently had not as yet decided the point  in his own mind; and he sat still in his seat on one of the shaft-mules,  whistling in a low contemplative strain to himself.    \"My advice is,\" resumed the captain, \"that we unload; for I'll bet any  man five pounds that if we try to go through, we shall stick fast.\"    \"By the powers, we shall stick fast!\" echoed Jack, the captain's  brother, shaking his large head with an air of firm conviction.    \"Drive on! drive on!\" cried R. petulantly.    \"Well,\" observed the captain, turning to us as we sat looking on, much  edified by this by-play among our confederates, \"I can only give my  advice and if people won't be reasonable, why, they won't; that's all!\"    Meanwhile Wright had apparently made up his mind; for he suddenly began  to shout forth a volley of oaths and curses, that, compared with the  French imprecations of Delorier, sounded like the roaring of heavy  cannon after the popping and sputtering of a bunch of Chinese crackers.  At the same time he discharged a shower of blows upon his mules, who  hastily dived into the mud and drew the wagon lumbering after them. For  a moment the issue was dubious. Wright writhed about in his saddle,  and swore and lashed like a madman; but who can count on a team of  half-broken mules? At the most critical point, when all should have been  harmony and combined effort, the perverse brutes fell into lamentable  disorder, and huddled together in confusion on the farther bank. There  was the wagon up to the hub in mud, and visibly settling every instant.  There was nothing for it but to unload;"]]]
