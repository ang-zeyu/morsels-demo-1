This is, perhaps, the best physiological  characterization of precocity and issues in excessive nervous and  muscular irritability. The great influx of muscular vigor that unfolds  during adolescent years and which was originally not only necessary to  successful propagation, but expressive of virility, seems to be a very  plastic quantity, so that motor regimen and exercise at this stage is  probably more important and all-conditioning for mentality, sexuality,  and health than at any other period of life. Intensity, and for a time  a spurty diathesis, is as instinctive and desirable as are the copious  minor automatisms which spontaneously give the alphabet out of which  complex and finer motor series are later spelled by the conscious  will. Mercier and others have pointed out that, as most skilled labor,  so school work and modern activities in civilized life generally lay  premature and disproportionate strains upon those kinds of movement  requiring exactness. Stress upon basal movements is not only  compensating but is of higher therapeutic value against the disorders  of the accessory system; it constitutes the best core or prophylactic  for fidgets and tense states, and directly develops poise, control,  and psycho-physical equilibrium. Even when contractions reach choreic  intensity the best treatment is to throw activities down the scale  that measures the difference between primary and secondary movements  and to make the former predominate.    The number of movements, the frequency with which they are repeated,  their diversity, the number of combinations, and their total kinetic  quantum in young children, whether we consider movements of the body  as a whole, fundamental movements of large limbs, or finer accessory  motions, is amazing. Nearly every external stimulus is answered by a  motor response. Dresslar[5] observed a thirteen months' old baby for  four hours, and found, to follow Preyer's classification, impulsive or  spontaneous, reflex, instinctive, imitative, inhibitive, expressive,  and even deliberative movements, with marked satisfaction in rhythm,  attempts to do almost anything which appealed to him, and almost  inexhaustible efferent resources. A friend has tried to record every  word uttered by a four-year-old girl during a portion of a day, and  finds nothing less than verbigerations. A teacher noted the activities  of a fourteen-year-old boy during the study time of a single school  day[6], with similar results.    Lindley[7] studied 897 common motor automatisms in children, which he  divided into 92 classes: 45 in the region of the head, 20 in the feet  and legs, 19 in the hands and fingers. Arranged in the order of  frequency with which each was found, the list stood as follows:  fingers, feet, lips, tongue, head, body, hands, mouth, eyes, jaws,  legs, forehead, face, arms, ears. In the last five alone adolescents  exceeded children, the latter excelling the former most in those of  head, mouth, legs, and tongue, in this order. The writer believes that  there are many more automatisms than appeared in his returns.    School life, especially in the lower grades, is a rich field for the  study of these activities. They are familiar, as licking things,  clicking with the tongue, grinding the teeth, scratching, tapping,  twirling a lock of hair or chewing it, biting the nails (Berillon's  onychophagia), shrugging, corrugating, pulling buttons or twisting  garments, strings, etc., twirling pencils, thumbs, rotating, nodding  and shaking the head, squinting and winking, swaying, pouting and  grimacing, scraping the floor, rubbing hands, stroking, patting,  flicking the fingers, wagging, snapping the fingers, muffling,  squinting, picking the face, interlacing the fingers, cracking the  joints, finger plays, biting and nibbling, trotting the leg, sucking  things, etc.    The average number of automatisms per 100 persons Smith found to be in  children 176, in adolescents 110. Swaying is chiefly with children;  playing and drumming with the fingers is more common among  adolescents; the movements of fingers and feet decline little with  age, and those of eyes and forehead increase, which is significant for  the development of attention. Girls excel greatly in swaying, and  also, although less, in finger automatism; and boys lead in movements  of tongue, feet, and hands. Such movements increase, with too much  sitting, intensity of effort, such as to fix attention, and vary with  the nature of the activity willed, but involve few muscles directly  used in a given task. They increase up the kindergarten grades and  fall off rapidly in the primary grades; are greater with tasks  requiring fine and exact movements than with those involving large  movements. Automatisms are often a sign of the difficulty of tasks.  The restlessness that they often express is one of the commonest signs  of fatigue. They are mostly in the accessory muscles, while those of  the fundamental muscles (body, legs, and arms) disappear rapidly with  age; those of eye, brow, and jaw show greatest increase with age, but  their frequency in general declines with growing maturity, although  there is increased frequency of certain specialized contractions,  which indicate the gradual settling of expression in the face.    Often such movements pass over by insensible gradation into the morbid  automatism of chorea, and in yet lower levels of decay we see them in  the aimless picking and plucking movements of the fingers of the sick.  In idiots[8] arrest of higher powers often goes with hypertrophy of  these movements, as seen in head-beaters (as if, just as nature impels  those partially blind to rub the eyes for \"light-hunger,\" so it  prompts the feeble-minded to strike the head for cerebrations),  rockers, rackers, shakers, biters, etc. Movements often pass to fixed  attitudes and postures of limbs or body, disturbing the normal balance  between flexors and extensors, the significance of which as nerve  signs or exponents of habitual brain states and tensions Warner has so  admirably shown.    Abundance and vigor of automatic movements are desirable, and even a  considerable degree of restlessness is a good sign in young children.  Many of what are now often called nerve signs and even choreic  symptoms, the fidgetiness in school on cloudy days and often after a  vacation, the motor superfluities of awkwardness, embarrassment,  extreme effort, excitement, fatigue, sleepiness, etc., are simply the  forms in which we receive the full momentum of heredity and mark a  natural richness of the raw material of intellect, feeling, and  especially of will. Hence they must be abundant. All parts should act  in all possible ways at first and untrammeled by the activity of all  other parts and functions. Some of these activities are more essential  for growth in size than are later and more conscious movements. Here  as everywhere the rule holds that powers themselves must be unfolded  before the ability to check or even to use them can develop. All  movements arising from spontaneous activity of nerve cells or centers  must be made in order even to avoid the atrophy of disease. Not only  so, but this purer kind of innateness must often be helped out to some  extent in some children by stimulating reflexes; a rich and wide  repertory of sensation must be made familiar; more or less and very  guarded, watched and limited experiences of hunger, thirst, cold,  heat, tastes, sounds, smells, colors, brightnesses, tactile  irritations, and perhaps even occasional tickling and pain to play off  the vastly complex function of laughing, crying, etc., may in some  cases be judicious. Conscious and unconscious imitation or repetition  of every sort of copy may also help to establish the immediate and  low-level connection between afferent and efferent processes that  brings the organism into direct _rapport_ and harmony with the whole  world of sense. Perhaps the more rankly and independently they are  developed to full functional integrity, each in its season, if we only  knew that season, the better. Premature control by higher centers, or  coordination into higher compounds of habits and ordered serial  activities, is repressive and wasteful, and the mature will of which  they are components, or which must at least domesticate them, is  stronger and more forcible if this serial stage is not unduly  abridged.    But, secondly, many, if not most, of these activities when developed a  little, group after group, as they arise, must be controlled, checked,  and organized into higher and often more serial compounds. The  inhibiting functions are at first hard. In trying to sit still the  child sets its teeth, holds the breath, clenches its fists and perhaps  makes every muscle tense with a great effort that very soon exhausts.  This repressive function is probably not worked from special nervous  centers, nor can we speak with confidence of collisions with \"sums of  arrest\" in a sense analogous to that of Herbart, or of stimuli that  normally cause catabolic molecular processes in the cell, being  mysteriously diverted to produce increased instability or anabolic  lability in the sense of Wundt's _Mechanik der Nerven_. The concept  now suggested by many facts is that inhibition is irradiation or long  circuiting to higher and more complex brain areas, so that the energy,  whether spontaneous or reflex, is diverted to be used elsewhere. These  combinations are of a higher order, more remote from reflex action,  and modified by some Jacksonian third level.[9] Action is now not from  independent centers, but these are slowly associated, so that  excitation may flow off from one point to any other and any reaction  may result from any stimulus.

Tarzan recognized the ear-marks of the witch-doctor and awaited  Numa's charge with a feeling of pleasurable anticipation, for the  ape-man had no love for witch-doctors; but in the instant that Numa did  charge, the white man suddenly recalled that the lion had stolen his  kill a few minutes before and that revenge is sweet.    The first intimation the black man had that he was in danger was the  crash of twigs as Numa charged through the bushes into the game trail  not twenty yards behind him.  Then he turned to see a huge, black-maned  lion racing toward him and even as he turned, Numa seized him.  At the  same instant the ape-man dropped from an overhanging limb full upon the  lion's back and as he alighted he plunged his knife into the tawny side  behind the left shoulder, tangled the fingers of his right hand in the  long mane, buried his teeth in Numa's neck and wound his powerful legs  about the beast's torso.  With a roar of pain and rage, Numa reared up  and fell backward upon the ape-man; but still the mighty man-thing  clung to his hold and repeatedly the long knife plunged rapidly into  his side.  Over and over rolled Numa, the lion, clawing and biting at  the air, roaring and growling horribly in savage attempt to reach the  thing upon its back.  More than once was Tarzan almost brushed from his  hold.  He was battered and bruised and covered with blood from Numa and  dirt from the trail, yet not for an instant did he lessen the ferocity  of his mad attack nor his grim hold upon the back of his antagonist.  To have loosened for an instant his grip there, would have been to  bring him within reach of those tearing talons or rending fangs, and  have ended forever the grim career of this jungle-bred English lord.  Where he had fallen beneath the spring of the lion the witch-doctor  lay, torn and bleeding, unable to drag himself away and watched the  terrific battle between these two lords of the jungle.  His sunken eyes  glittered and his wrinkled lips moved over toothless gums as he mumbled  weird incantations to the demons of his cult.    For a time he felt no doubt as to the outcome--the strange white man  must certainly succumb to terrible Simba--whoever heard of a lone man  armed only with a knife slaying so mighty a beast!  Yet presently the  old black man's eyes went wider and he commenced to have his doubts and  misgivings.  What wonderful sort of creature was this that battled with  Simba and held his own despite the mighty muscles of the king of beasts  and slowly there dawned in those sunken eyes, gleaming so brightly from  the scarred and wrinkled face, the light of a dawning recollection.  Gropingly backward into the past reached the fingers of memory, until  at last they seized upon a faint picture, faded and yellow with the  passing years.  It was the picture of a lithe, white-skinned youth  swinging through the trees in company with a band of huge apes, and the  old eyes blinked and a great fear came into them--the superstitious  fear of one who believes in ghosts and spirits and demons.    And came the time once more when the witch-doctor no longer doubted the  outcome of the duel, yet his first judgment was reversed, for now he  knew that the jungle god would slay Simba and the old black was even  more terrified of his own impending fate at the hands of the victor  than he had been by the sure and sudden death which the triumphant lion  would have meted out to him.  He saw the lion weaken from loss of  blood.  He saw the mighty limbs tremble and stagger and at last he saw  the beast sink down to rise no more.  He saw the forest god or demon  rise from the vanquished foe, and placing a foot upon the still  quivering carcass, raise his face to the moon and bay out a hideous cry  that froze the ebbing blood in the veins of the witch-doctor.          4    Prophecy and Fulfillment      Then Tarzan turned his attention to the man.  He had not slain Numa to  save the Negro--he had merely done it in revenge upon the lion; but now  that he saw the old man lying helpless and dying before him something  akin to pity touched his savage heart.  In his youth he would have  slain the witch-doctor without the slightest compunction; but  civilization had had its softening effect upon him even as it does upon  the nations and races which it touches, though it had not yet gone far  enough with Tarzan to render him either cowardly or effeminate.  He saw  an old man suffering and dying, and he stooped and felt of his wounds  and stanched the flow of blood.    \"Who are you?\" asked the old man in a trembling voice.    \"I am Tarzan--Tarzan of the Apes,\" replied the ape-man and not without  a greater touch of pride than he would have said, \"I am John Clayton,  Lord Greystoke.\"    The witch-doctor shook convulsively and closed his eyes.  When he  opened them again there was in them a resignation to whatever horrible  fate awaited him at the hands of this feared demon of the woods.  \"Why  do you not kill me?\" he asked.    \"Why should I kill you?\" inquired Tarzan.  \"You have not harmed me, and  anyway you are already dying.  Numa, the lion, has killed you.\"    \"You would not kill me?\" Surprise and incredulity were in the tones of  the quavering old voice.    \"I would save you if I could,\" replied Tarzan, \"but that cannot be  done.  Why did you think I would kill you?\"    For a moment the old man was silent.  When he spoke it was evidently  after some little effort to muster his courage.  \"I knew you of old,\"  he said, \"when you ranged the jungle in the country of Mbonga, the  chief.  I was already a witch-doctor when you slew Kulonga and the  others, and when you robbed our huts and our poison pot.  At first I  did not remember you; but at last I did--the white-skinned ape that  lived with the hairy apes and made life miserable in the village of  Mbonga, the chief--the forest god--the Munango-Keewati for whom we set  food outside our gates and who came and ate it.  Tell me before I  die--are you man or devil?\"    Tarzan laughed.  \"I am a man,\" he said.    The old fellow sighed and shook his head.  \"You have tried to save me  from Simba,\" he said.  \"For that I shall reward you.  I am a great  witch-doctor.  Listen to me, white man!  I see bad days ahead of you.  It is writ in my own blood which I have smeared upon my palm.  A god  greater even than you will rise up and strike you down.  Turn back,  Munango-Keewati!  Turn back before it is too late.  Danger lies ahead  of you and danger lurks behind; but greater is the danger before.  I  see--\" He paused and drew a long, gasping breath.  Then he crumpled  into a little, wrinkled heap and died.  Tarzan wondered what else he  had seen.    It was very late when the ape-man re-entered the boma and lay down  among his black warriors.  None had seen him go and none saw him  return.  He thought about the warning of the old witch-doctor before he  fell asleep and he thought of it again after he awoke; but he did not  turn back for he was unafraid, though had he known what lay in store  for one he loved most in all the world he would have flown through the  trees to her side and allowed the gold of Opar to remain forever hidden  in its forgotten storehouse.    Behind him that morning another white man pondered something he had  heard during the night and very nearly did he give up his project and  turn back upon his trail.  It was Werper, the murderer, who in the  still of the night had heard far away upon the trail ahead of him a  sound that had filled his cowardly soul with terror--a sound such as he  never before had heard in all his life, nor dreamed that such a  frightful thing could emanate from the lungs of a God-created creature.  He had heard the victory cry of the bull ape as Tarzan had screamed it  forth into the face of Goro, the moon, and he had trembled then and  hidden his face; and now in the broad light of a new day he trembled  again as he recalled it, and would have turned back from the nameless  danger the echo of that frightful sound seemed to portend, had he not  stood in even greater fear of Achmet Zek, his master.    And so Tarzan of the Apes forged steadily ahead toward Opar's ruined  ramparts and behind him slunk Werper, jackal-like, and only God knew  what lay in store for each.    At the edge of the desolate valley, overlooking the golden domes and  minarets of Opar, Tarzan halted.  By night he would go alone to the  treasure vault, reconnoitering, for he had determined that caution  should mark his every move upon this expedition.    With the coming of night he set forth, and Werper, who had scaled the  cliffs alone behind the ape-man's party, and hidden through the day  among the rough boulders of the mountain top, slunk stealthily after  him.  The boulder-strewn plain between the valley's edge and the mighty  granite kopje, outside the city's walls, where lay the entrance to the  passage-way leading to the treasure vault, gave the Belgian ample cover  as he followed Tarzan toward Opar.    He saw the giant ape-man swing himself nimbly up the face of the great  rock.  Werper, clawing fearfully during the perilous ascent, sweating  in terror, almost palsied by fear, but spurred on by avarice, following  upward, until at last he stood upon the summit of the rocky hill.    Tarzan was nowhere in sight.  For a time Werper hid behind one of the  lesser boulders that were scattered over the top of the hill, but,  seeing or hearing nothing of the Englishman, he crept from his place of  concealment to undertake a systematic search of his surroundings, in  the hope that he might discover the location of the treasure in ample  time to make his escape before Tarzan returned, for it was the  Belgian's desire merely to locate the gold, that, after Tarzan had  departed, he might come in safety with his followers and carry away as  much as he"]]]
