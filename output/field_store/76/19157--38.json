It is useful to select a variety of herbs, so that they may always  be at hand for use: the following are considered to be an excellent  selection, parsley, savory, thyme, sweet majoram, shalot, chervil, and  sage, in equal quantities; dry these in the oven, pound them finely  and keep them in bottles well stopped.           *       *       *       *       *    SEASONING FOR DUCKS AND GEESE.    Mix chopped onion with an equal quantity of chopped sage, three times  as much grated stale bread, a little shred suet, pepper, salt, and a  beaten egg to bind it, this is generally used for geese and ducks, the  onions are sometimes boiled first to render them less strong.           *       *       *       *       *    ENGLISH EGG SAUCE.    Boil two eggs hard, chop them finely, and warm them up in finely made  melted butter, add a little white pepper, salt, a blade of mace, and a  very small quantity of nutmeg.           *       *       *       *       *    SAUCE A LA TARTARE.    Mix the yolk of an egg with oil, vinegar, chopped parsley, mustard,  pepper, and salt; a spoonful of pate de diable or French mustard,  renders the sauce more piquante.           *       *       *       *       *    A FINE SAUCE FOR ROAST MUTTON.    Mix a little port wine in some gravy, two table-spoonfuls of vinegar,  one of oil, a shalot minced, and a spoonful of mustard, just before  the mutton is served, pour the sauce over it, then sprinkle it with  fried bread crumbs, and then again baste the meat with the sauce; this  is a fine addition to the mutton.           *       *       *       *       *    ASPARAGUS SAUCE, TO SERVE WITH LAMB CHOPS.    Cut some asparagus, or sprew, into half inch lengths, wash them, and  throw them into half a pint of gravy made from beef, veal, or mutton  thickened, and seasoned with salt, white pepper, and a lump of white  sugar, the chops should be delicately fried and the sauce served in  the centre of the dish.           *       *       *       *       *    BROWN CUCUMBER SAUCE.    Peel and cut in thick slices, one or more fresh cucumbers, fry them  until brown in a little butter, or clarified fat, then add to them  a little strong beef gravy, pepper, salt, and a spoonful of vinegar;  some cooks add a chopped onion browned with the cucumbers.           *       *       *       *       *    WHITE CUCUMBER SAUCE.    Take out the seeds of some fresh young cucumbers, quarter them, and  cut them into pieces of two inch lengths, let them lay for an hour in  vinegar and water, then simmer them till thoroughly soft, in a veal  broth seasoned with pepper, salt, and a little lemon juice; when ready  for serving, pour off the gravy and thicken it with the yolks of a  couple of eggs stirred in, add it to the saucepan; warm up, taking  care that it does not curdle.           *       *       *       *       *    BROWNED FLOUR FOR MAKING SOUPS AND GRAVIES DARK AND THICK.    Spread flour on a tin, and place it in a Dutch oven before the fire,  or in a gentle oven till it browns; it must often be turned, that the  flour may be equally coloured throughout. A small quantity of this  prepared and laid by for use, will be found useful.           *       *       *       *       *    BROWNED BREAD CRUMBS.    Grate into fine crumbs, about five or six ounces of stale bread,  and brown them in a gentle oven or before the fire; this is a more  delicate way of browning them than by frying.           *       *       *       *       *    CRISPED PARSLEY.    Wash and drain a handful of fresh young sprigs of parsley, dry  them with a cloth, place them before the fire on a dish, turn them  frequently, and they will be perfectly crisp in ten minutes.           *       *       *       *       *    FRIED PARSLEY.    When the parsley is prepared as above, fry it in butter or clarified  suet, then drain it on a cloth placed before the fire.           *       *       *       *       *    BREAD CRUMBS FOR FRYING.    Cut slices of bread without crust, and dry them gradually in a cool  oven till quite dry and crisp, then roll them into fine crumbs, and  put them in a jar for use.           *       *       *       *       *    SPINACH GREEN.    Pound to a pulp in a mortar a handful of spinach, and squeeze it  through a hair sieve; then put it into a cup or jar, and place it in  a basin of hot water for a few minutes, or it may be allowed to simmer  on the fire; a little of this stirred into spring soups, improve their  appearance.           *       *       *       *       *    VELOUTE, BECHAMEL.    These preparations are so frequently mentioned in modern cookery, that  we shall give the receipts for them, although they are not appropriate  for the Jewish kitchen. Veloute is a fine white sauce, made by  reducing a certain quantity of well-flavoured consomme or stock,  over a charcoal fire, and mixing it with boiling cream, stirring it  carefully till it thickens.    Bechamel is another sort of fine white stock, thickened with cream,  there is more flavouring in this than the former, the stock is made of  veal, with some of the smoked meats used in English kitchens, butter,  mace, onion, mushrooms, bay leaf, nutmeg, and a little salt. An  excellent substitute for these sauces can in Jewish kitchens be made  in the following way:    Take some veal broth flavored with smoked beef, and the above named  seasonings, then beat up two or three yolks of eggs, with a little of  the stock and a spoonful of potatoe flour, stir this into the  broth, until it thickens, it will not be quite as white, but will be  excellent.           *       *       *       *       *    FORCEMEAT OR FARCIE.    Under this head is included the various preparations used for balls,  tisoles, fritters, and stuffings for poultry and veal, it is a branch  of cooking which requires great care and judgment, the proportions  should be so blended as to produce a delicate, yet savoury flavor,  without allowing any particular herb or spice to predominate.    The ingredients should always be pounded well together in a mortar,  not merely chopped and moistened with egg, as is usually done by  inexperienced cooks; forcemeat can be served in a variety of forms,  and is so useful a resource, that it well repays the attention it  requires.           *       *       *       *       *    A SUPERIOR FORCEMEAT FOR RISOLLES, FRITTERS, AND SAVORY MEAT BALLS.    Scrape half a pound of the fat of smoked beef, and a pound of lean  veal, free from skin, vein, or sinew, pound it finely in a mortar  with chopped mushrooms, a little minced parsley, salt and pepper,  and grated lemon peel, then have ready the crumb of two French rolls  soaked in good gravy, press out the moisture, and add the crumb to the  meat with three beaten eggs; if the forcemeat is required to be very  highly flavored, the gravy in which the rolls are soaked should be  seasoned with mushroom powder; a spoonful of ketchup, a bay leaf, an  onion, pepper, salt, and lemon juice, add this panada to the pounded  meat and eggs, form the mixture into any form required, and either fry  or warm in gravy, according to the dish for which it is intended.    Any cold meats pounded, seasoned, and made according to the above  method are excellent; the seasoning can be varied, or rendered simpler  if required.           *       *       *       *       *    COMMON VEAL, STUFFING.    Have equal quantities of finely shred suet and grated crumbs of bread,  add chopped sweet herbs, grated lemon peel, pepper, and salt, pound it  in a mortar; this is also used for white poultry, with the addition  of a little grated smoked beef, or a piece of the root of a tongue  pounded and mixed with the above ingredients.           *       *       *       *       *    FISH FORCEMEAT.    Chop finely any kind of fish, that which has been already dressed  will answer the purpose, then pound it in a mortar with a couple of  anchovies, or a little anchovy essence, the yolk of a hard boiled  egg, a little butter, parsley or any other herb which may be approved,  grated lemon peel, and a little of the juice, then add a little bread  previously soaked, and mix the whole into a paste, and form into  balls, or use for stuffing, &c.    The liver or roe of fish is well suited to add to the fish, as it is  rich and delicate.           *       *       *       *       *    FORCEMEAT FOR DRESSING FISH FILLETS.    Pound finely anchovies, grated bread, chopped parsley, and the yolk of  a hard boiled egg, add grated lemon peel, a little lemon juice, pepper  and salt, and make into a paste with two eggs.           *       *       *       *       *    FORCEMEAT FOR DRESSING CUTLETS, ETC.    Add to grated stale bread, an equal quantity of chopped parsley,  season it well, and mix it with clarified suet, then brush the cutlets  with beaten yolks of eggs, lay on the mixture thickly with a knife,  and sprinkle over with dry and fine bread crumbs.           *       *       *       *       *    EGG BALLS.    Beat the hard yolks of eggs in a mortar, make it into a paste with  the yolk of a raw egg, form the paste into very small balls, and throw  them into boiling water for a minute or so, to harden them.           *       *       *       *       *    PREPARATION FOR CUTLETS OF FOWL OR VEAL.    Make a smooth batter of flour, and a little salad oil, and two eggs,  a little white pepper, salt, and nutmeg, turn the cutlets well in  this mixture, and fry a light brown, garnish with slices of lemon,  and crisped parsley, this is done by putting in the parsley after the  cutlets have been fried, it will speedily crisp; it should then be  drained, to prevent its being greasy.          CHAPTER III.      Fish.    PRELIMINARY REMARKS.    When fish is to be boiled, it should be rubbed lightly over with salt,  and set on the fire in a saucepan or fish-kettle sufficiently large,  in hard cold water, with a little salt, a spoonful or two of vinegar  is sometimes added, which has the effect"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1233"],[0,"The Origin and Nature of the Emotions; Miscellaneous Papers (#5)"],[1,"iation.  The almost universal fear of snakes, of blood, and of death  and dead bodies may have such a phylogenetic origin.  It was previously stated that under the stimulus of fear animals  show preternatural strength.  An analysis of the phenomena of fear  shows that, as far as can be determined, all the functions of the body  requiring the expenditure of energy, and which are of no direct  assistance in the effort toward self-preservation, are suspended.  In the voluntary expenditure of muscular energy, as in the chase,  the suspension of other functions is by no means so complete.  Fear and trauma may drain to the last dreg the dischargeable  nervous energy, and, therefore, the greatest possible exhaustion  may be produced by fear and trauma.      Summation    In the discharge of energy, summation plays an important role.  Summation is attained by the repetition of stimuli at such a rate  that each succeeding stimulus is applied before the nerve-cells  have returned to the resting stage from the preceding stimulus.  If drops of water fall upon the skin from a sufficient height to cause  the slightest unpleasant sensation, and at such a rate that before  the effect of the stimulus of one drop has passed another drop  falls in precisely the same spot, there will be felt a gradually  increasing painful sensation which finally becomes unbearable.  This is summation of stimuli.  When, for a long time, a patient  requires frequent painful wound dressings, there is a gradual  increase in the acuteness of the pain of the receptors.  This is caused by summation.  In a larger sense, the entire behavior  of the individual gives considerable evidence of summation, _e.  g_., in the training of athletes, the rhythmic discharge of muscular  energy at such intervals that the resting stage is not reached  before a new exercise is given results in a gradual ascent  in efficiency until the maximum is reached.  This is summation,  and summation plays a large role in the development of both normal  and pathologic phenomena.    We have now pointed out the manner in which at least  a part of the nervous energy of man may be discharged.  The integrative action of the nervous system and the discharge  of nervous energy by phylogenetic association may be illustrated  by their analogy to the action of an electric automobile.  The electric automobile is composed of four principal parts:  The motor and the wheels (the muscular system and the skeleton);  the cells of the battery containing stored electricity  (brain-cells, nervous energy); the controller, which is connected  with the cells by wiring (the receptors and the nerve-fibers);  and an accelerator for increasing the electric discharge  (thyroid gland?). The machine is so constructed that it acts  as a whole for the accomplishment of a single purpose.  When the controller is adjusted for going ahead (adequate stimulus  of a receptor), then the conducting paths (the final common path)  for the accomplishment of that purpose are all open to the flow of  the current from the battery, and the vehicle is integrated to go ahead.  It spends its energy to that end and is closed to all other impulses.  When the controller is set for reverse, by this adequate stimulus  the machine is integrated to back, and the battery is closed to all  other impulses.  Whether integrated for going forward or backward,  if the battery be discharged at a proper rate until exhausted,  the cells, though possessing no more power (fatigue), have sustained  no further impairment of their elements than that of normal wear  and tear.  Furthermore, they may be restored to normal activity  by recharging (rest). If the vehicle be placed against a stone wall,  and the controller be placed at high-speed (trauma and fear),  and if the accelerator be used as well (thyroid secretion?), though  the machine will not move, not only will the battery soon be exhausted,  but the battery elements themselves will be seriously damaged  (exhaustion--surgical shock).    We have now presented some evidence that nervous energy is  discharged by the adequate stimulation of one or more of the various  receptors that have been developed in the course of evolution.  In response to an adequate stimulus, the nervous system is  integrated for a specific purpose by the stimulated receptor,  and but one stimulus at a time has possession of the final common path--  the nerve mechanisms for action.  The most numerous receptors  are those for harmful contact; these are the nociceptors.  The effect of the adequate stimulus of a nociceptor is like that of  pressing an electric button that sets great machinery in motion.    With this conception, the human body may be likened to a  musical instrument--an organ--the keyboard of which is composed  of the various receptors, upon which environment plays the many  tunes of life; and written within ourselves in symbolic language  is the history of our evolution.  The skin may be the \"Rosetta Stone\"  which furnishes the key.      Anoci-association      By the law of phylogenetic association, we are now prepared  to make a practical application of the principles of the discharge  of nervous energy.  In the case of a surgical operation, if fear  be excluded and if the nerve-paths between the field of operation  and the brain be blocked with cocain,[*] no discharge of energy will be  caused by the operation; hence no shock, no exhaustion, can result.  Under such conditions the nervous system is protected against  noci-association, resulting from noci-perception or from an adequate  stimulation of nociceptors.  The state of the patient in whom all  noci-associations are excluded can be described only by coining  a new word.  That word is \"anoci-association\" (Fig. 14).      [*] See footnote, page 4.@@@      The difference between anesthesia and anoci-association is that,  although _inhalation anesthesia_ confers the beneficent loss of  consciousness and freedom from pain, it does not prevent the nerve  impulses from reaching and influencing the brain, and therefore does  not prevent surgical shock nor the train of later nervous impairments  so well described by Mumford.  _Anoci-association_ excludes fear,  pain, shock, and postoperative neuroses.  _Anoci-association_ is  accomplished by combining the special management of patients  (applied psychology), morphin, inhalation anesthesia,  and local anesthesia.    We have now presented in summary much of the mass of experimental  and clinical evidence we have accumulated in support of our  principal theme, which is that the discharge of nervous energy is  accomplished in accordance with the law of phylogenetic association.  If this point seems to have been emphasized unduly, it is because  we expect to rear upon this foundation a clinical structure.  How does this hypothesis apply to surgical operations?      Prevention of Shock by the Application of the Principle of  Anoci-association        Upon this hypothesis a new principle in operative surgery is founded, _i.  e_., operation during the state of _anoci-association_. Assuming that  no unfavorable effect is produced by the anesthetic and that there is  no hemorrhage, the cells of the brain cannot be exhausted in the course  of a surgical operation except by fear or by trauma, or by both.  Fear may be excluded by narcotics and special management until  the patient is rendered unconscious by inhalation anesthesia.  Then if, in addition to inhalation anesthesia, the nerve-paths  between the brain and the field of operation are blocked with  cocain,[*] the patient will be placed in the beneficent state of  _anoci-association_, and at the completion of the operation will be  as free from shock as at the beginning.  In so-called \"fair risks\"  such precautions may not be necessary, but in cases handicapped  by infections, by anemia, by previous shock, and by Graves'  disease, etc., anoci-association may become vitally important.      [*] See footnote, page 4.@@@      Graves' Disease      By applying the principle of the discharge of nervous energy by  phylogenetic association, and by making the additional hypothesis  that in the discharge of nervous energy the thyroid gland is stimulated  through the nervous system, we can explain many of the phenomena  of Graves' disease and may possibly discover some of the factors  which explain both its genesis and its cure.    In the wild state of animal life in which only the fittest  survive in the struggle for existence, every point of advantage  has its value.  An animal engaged in battle or in a desperate  effort to escape will be able to give a better account of itself  if it have some means of accelerating the discharge of energy--  some influence like that of pouring oil upon the kindling fire.  There is evidence, though perhaps it is not conclusive,  that such an influence is exerted by the thyroid gland.  In myxedema, a condition characterized by a lack of thyroid secretion,  there is dulness of the reflexes and of the intellect, a lowered  muscular power, and generally a sluggish discharge of energy.  In Graves' disease there is an excessive production of thyroid secretion.  In this disease the reflexes are increased, the discharge of  energy is greatly facilitated, and metabolism is at a maximum.  The same phenomena occur also after the administration of thyroid  extract in large doses to normal subjects.  In the course of  sexual activities there is an increased action of the thyroid,  which is indicated by an increase in its size and vascularity.  That in fear and in injury the thyroid, in cases of Graves'  disease, is probably stimulated to increased activity is indicated  by the increased activity of the thyroid circulation, by an increase  in the size of the gland, by the histologic appearance of activity  in the nuclei of the cells, and by an increase of the toxic symptoms.  Finally, Asher has stated that electric stimulation of the nerve supply  of the thyroid "]]]
