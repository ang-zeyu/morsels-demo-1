[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097"],[0,"Robert's Rules of Order (#4)"],[1,"an objection to the  consideration of the question [Sec. 15]; or (d) by a call for the orders of  the day [Sec. 13].* [See note to Sec. 61.] In such cases the member when he  arises and addresses the Chair should state at once for what purpose he  rises, as, for instance, that he \"rises to a point of order.\"  A call  for an adjournment, or for the question, by members in their seats, is  not a motion; as no motion can be made, without rising and addressing,  the Chair, and being announced by the presiding officer.  Such calls for  the question are themselves breaches of order, and do not prevent the  speaker from going on if he pleases.    3. Before any subject is open to debate [Sec. 34] it is necessary, first,  that a motion he made; second, that it be seconded, (see exceptions  below); and third, that it be stated by the presiding officer.  When the  motion is in writing it shall be handed to the Chairman, and read before  it is debated.    This does not prevent suggestions of alterations, before the question is  stated by the    === Page 20 ============================================================    presiding officer.  To the contrary, much time may be saved by such  informal remarks; which, however, must never be allowed to run into  debate.  The member who offers the motion, until it has been stated by  the presiding officer, can modify his motion, or even withdraw it  entirely; after it is stated he can do neither, without the consent of  the assembly.  [See Sec.Sec. 5 and 17].  When the mover modifies his motion,  the one who seconded it can withdraw his second.    Exceptions:  A call for the order of the day, a question of order  (though not an appeal), or an objection to the consideration of a  question [Sec.Sec. 13, 14, 15], does not have to be seconded; and many  questions of routine are not seconded or even made; the presiding  officer merely announcing that, if no objection is made, such will be  considered the action of the assembly.    4. All Principal Motions [Sec. 6], Amendments and Instructions to  Committees, should be in writing, if required by the presiding officer.  Although a question is complicated, and capable of being made into  several questions, no one member (without there is a special rule  allowing it) can insist upon its being divided; his resource is to move  that the question be divided, specifying in his motion how it is to be  divided.  Any one else can move as    === Page 21 ============================================================    an amendment to this, to divide it differently.    This Division of a Question is really an amendment [Sec. 23], and subject  to the same rules.  Instead of moving a division of the question, the  same result can be usually attained by moving some other form of an  amendment.  When the question is divided, each separate question must be  a proper one for the assembly to act upon, even if none of the others  were adopted.  Thus, a motion to \"commit with instructions,\" is  indivisible, because if divided, and the motion to commit should fail,  then the other motion to instruct the committee would be improper, as  there would be no committee to instruct.* [The 46th Rule of the House of  Representatives requires the division of a question on the demand of one  member, provided \"it comprehends propositions in substance so distinct  that one being taken away, a substantive proposition shall remain for  the decision of the House.\"  But this does not allow a division so as to  have a vote on separate items or names.  The 121st Rule expressly  provides that on the demand of one-fifth of the members a separate vote  shall be taken on such items separately, and others collectively, as  shall be specified in the call, in the case of a bill making  appropriations for internal improvements.  But this right to divide a  question into items extends to no case but the one specified.  The  common parliamentary law allows of no division except when the assembly  orders it, and in ordinary assemblies this rule will be found to give  less trouble than the Congressional one.]    The motion to \"strike out certain words and insert others,\" is  indivisible, as it is strictly one proposition.    5. After a question has been stated by the presiding officer, it is in  the possession of the    === Page 22 ============================================================    assembly for debate; the mover cannot withdraw or modify it, if any one  objects, except by obtaining leave from the assembly [Sec. 17], or by  moving an amendment.    Art. II.  General Classification of Motions.  [Sec.Sec. 6-9.]    6. A Principal or Main Question or Motion, is a motion made to bring  before the assembly, for its consideration, any particular subject.  No  Principal Motion can be made when any other question is before the  assembly.  It takes precedence of nothing, and yields to all Privileged,  Incidental and Subsidiary Questions [Sec.Sec. 7, 8, 9].    7. Subsidiary or Secondary Questions or Motions relate to a Principal  Motion, and enable the assembly to dispose of it in the most appropriate  manner.  These motions take precedence of the Principal Question, and  must be decided before the Principal Question can be acted upon.  They  yield to Privileged and Incidental Questions [Sec.Sec. 8, 9], and are as  follows (being arranged in their order of precedence among themselves):    === Page 23 ============================================================    Lie on the Table .................... See Sec. 19.  The Previous Question ...............  '' Sec. 20.  Postpone to a Certain Day ...........  '' Sec. 21.  Commit ..............................  '' Sec. 22.  Amend ...............................  '' Sec. 23.  Postpone Indefinitely ...............  '' Sec. 24.    Any of these motions (except Amend) can be made when one of a lower  order is pending, but none can supersede one of a higher order.  They  cannot be applied* [See Plan of Work and Definitions, in Introduction,  for explanation of some of these technical terms.] to one another except  in the following cases:  (a) the Previous Question applies to the motion  to Postpone, without affecting the principal motion, and can, if  specified, be applied to a pending amendment [Sec. 20]; (b) the motions to  Postpone to a certain day, and to Commit, can be amended; and (c) a  motion to Amend the minutes can be laid on the table without carrying  the minutes with it [Sec. 19].    8. Incidental Questions are such as arise out of other questions, and,  consequently, take precedence of, and are to be decided before, the  questions which give rise to them.  They yield to Privileged Questions  [Sec. 9], and cannot be amended.  Excepting an Appeal,    === Page 24 ============================================================    they are undebatable; an Appeal is debatable or not, according to  circumstances, as shown in Sec. 14.  They are as follows:      Appeal (or Questions of Order) ........................... See Sec. 14.    Objection to the Consideration of a Question .............  '' Sec. 15.    The Reading of Papers ....................................  '' Sec. 16.    Leave to Withdraw a Motion ...............................  '' Sec. 17.    Suspension of the Rules ..................................  '' Sec. 18.    9. Privileged Questions are such as, on account of their importance,  take precedence over all other questions whatever, and on account of  this very privilege they are undebatable [Sec. 35], excepting when relating  to the rights of the assembly or its members, as otherwise they could be  made use of so as to seriously interrupt business.  They are as follows  (being arranged in their order of precedence among themselves):      To Fix the Time to which the Assembly shall Adjourn ...... See Sec. 10.    Adjourn ..................................................  '' Sec. 11.    Questions relating to the Rights and      Privileges of the Assembly or any of      its Members ............................................  '' Sec. 12.    Call for the Orders of the Day ...........................  '' Sec. 13.    === Page 25 ============================================================    Art. III.  Motions and their Order of Precedence.* [For a list of all  the ordinary motions, arranged in their order of precedence, see Sec. 64.  All the Privileged and Subsidiary ones in this Article are so arranged.]  [Sec.Sec. 10-27.]    Privileged Motions.  [Sec.Sec. 10-13.  See Sec. 9.]    10.  To Fix the Time to which the Assembly shall Adjourn.  This motion  takes precedence of all others, and is in order even after the assembly  has voted to adjourn, provided the Chairman has not announced the result  of the vote.  If made when another question is before the assembly, it  is undebatable [Sec. 35]; it can be amended by altering the time.  If made  when no other question is before the asembly, it stands as any other  principal motion, and is debatable.** [In ordinary societies it is better  to follow the common parliamentary law, and permit this question to be  introduced as a principal question, when it can be debated and  suppressed [Sec. 58, 59] like other questions.  In Congress, it is never  debatable, and has entirely superseded the unprivileged and inferior  motion to \"adjourn to a particular time.\"]    The Form of this motion is, \"When this assembly    === Page 26 ============================================================    adjourns, it adjourns to meet at such a time.\"    11. To Adjourn.  This motion (when unqualified) takes precedence of all  others, except to \"fix the time to which to adjourn,\" to which it  yields.  It is not debatable, and cannot be amended, or have any other  subsidiary motion [Sec. 7] applied to it.  If qualified in any way it loses  its privileged character, and stands as any other principal motion.  The  motion to adjourn can be repeated if there has been any intervening  business, though it be simply"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9104"],[0,"The Naval War of 1812 (#4)"],[1,"hardly any steps  had been taken to protect the Capitol, or the country round about;  what little was done, was done entirely too late, and bungled badly  in addition. History has not yet done justice to the ludicrous and  painful folly and stupidity of which the government founded by  Jefferson, and carried on by Madison, was guilty, both in its  preparations for, and in its way of carrying on, this war; nor is  it yet realized that the men just mentioned, and their associates,  are primarily responsible for the loss we suffered in it, and the  bitter humiliation some of its incidents caused us. The small British  army marched at will through Virginia and Maryland, burned Washington,  and finally retreated from before Baltimore and reembarked to take  part in the expedition against New Orleans. Twice, at Bladensburg  and North Point, it came in contact with superior numbers of militia  in fairly good position. In each case the result was the same.  After some preliminary skirmishing, manoeuvring, and volley firing,  the British charged with the bayonet. The rawest regiments among  the American militia then broke at once; the others kept pretty  steady, pouring in quite a destructive fire, until the regulars had  come up close to them, when they also fled. The British regulars  were too heavily loaded to pursue, and, owing to their mode of  attack, and the rapidity with which their opponents ran away, the  loss of the latter was in each case very slight. At North Point,  however, the militia, being more experienced, behaved better than  at Bladensburg. In neither case were the British put to any trouble  to win their victory.    The above is a brief sketch of the campaigns of the war. It is not  cheerful reading for an American, nor yet of interest to a military  student; and its lessons have been taught so often by similar  occurrences in other lands under like circumstances, and, moreover,  teach such self-evident truths, that they scarcely need to be  brought to the notice of an historian. But the crowning event of  the war was the Battle of New Orleans; remarkable in its military  aspect, and a source of pride to every American. It is well worth  a more careful study, and to it I have devoted the last chapter of  this work.    New York City, 1883.
