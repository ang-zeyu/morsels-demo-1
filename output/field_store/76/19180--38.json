Esther, conscious of being an angel of deliverance,  tried to take the last two steps at once, tripped and tumbled  ignominiously against the garret-door, which flew back and let her fall  into the room with a crash. The pitcher shivered into fragments under  her aching little bosom, the odorous soup spread itself in an irregular  pool over the boards, and flowed under the two beds and dripped down the  crevices into the room beneath. Esther burst into tears; her frock was  wet and greased, her hands were cut and bleeding. Little Sarah checked  her sobs at the disaster. Moses Ansell was not yet returned from evening  service, but the withered old grandmother, whose wizened face loomed  through the gloom of the cold, unlit garret, sat up on the bed and  cursed her angrily for a _Schlemihl_. A sense of injustice made Esther  cry more bitterly. She had never broken anything for years past. Ikey,  an eerie-looking dot of four and a half years, tottered towards her (all  the Ansells had learnt to see in the dark), and nestling his curly head  against her wet bodice, murmured:    \"Neva mind, Estie, I lat oo teep in my new bed.\"    The consolation of sleeping in that imaginary new bed to the possession  of which Ikey was always looking forward was apparently adequate; for  Esther got up from the floor and untied the loaves from her pinafore. A  reckless spirit of defiance possessed her, as of a gambler who throws  good money after bad. They should have a mad revelry to-night--the two  loaves should be eaten at once. One (minus a hunk for father's supper)  would hardly satisfy six voracious appetites. Solomon and Rachel,  irrepressibly excited by the sight of the bread, rushed at it greedily,  snatched a loaf from Esther's hand, and tore off a crust each with their  fingers.    \"Heathen,\" cried the old grandmother. \"Washing and benediction.\"    Solomon was used to being called a \"heathen\" by the _Bube_. He put on  his cap and went grudgingly to the bucket of water that stood in a  corner of the room, and tipped a drop over his fingers. It is to be  feared that neither the quantity of water nor the area of hand covered  reached even the minimum enjoined by Rabbinical law. He murmured  something intended for Hebrew during the operation, and was beginning to  mutter the devout little sentence which precedes the eating of bread  when Rachel, who as a female was less driven to the lavatory ceremony,  and had thus got ahead of him, paused in her ravenous mastication and  made a wry face. Solomon took a huge bite at his crust, then he uttered  an inarticulate \"pooh,\" and spat out his mouthful.    There was no salt in the bread.          CHAPTER II.    THE SWEATER.      The catastrophe was not complete. There were some long thin fibres of  pale boiled meat, whose juices had gone to enrich the soup, lying about  the floor or adhering to the fragments of the pitcher. Solomon, who was  a curly-headed chap of infinite resource, discovered them, and it had  just been decided to neutralize the insipidity of the bread by the  far-away flavor of the meat, when a peremptory knocking was heard at the  door, and a dazzling vision of beauty bounded into the room.    \"'Ere! What are you doin', leavin' things leak through our ceiling?\"    Becky Belcovitch was a buxom, bouncing girl, with cherry cheeks that  looked exotic in a land of pale faces. She wore a mass of black crisp  ringlets aggressively suggestive of singeing and curl-papers. She was  the belle of Royal Street in her spare time, and womanly triumphs dogged  even her working hours. She was sixteen years old, and devoted her youth  and beauty to buttonholes. In the East End, where a spade is a spade, a  buttonhole is a buttonhole, and not a primrose or a pansy. There are two  kinds of buttonhole--the coarse for slop goods and the fine for  gentlemanly wear. Becky concentrated herself on superior buttonholes,  which are worked with fine twist. She stitched them in her father's  workshop, which was more comfortable than a stranger's, and better  fitted for evading the Factory Acts. To-night she was radiant in silk  and jewelry, and her pert snub nose had the insolence of felicity which  Agamemnon deprecated. Seeing her, you would have as soon connected her  with Esoteric Buddhism as with buttonholes.    The _Bube_ explained the situation in voluble Yiddish, and made Esther  wince again under the impassioned invective on her clumsiness. The old  beldame expended enough oriental metaphor on the accident to fit up a  minor poet. If the family died of starvation, their blood would be upon  their granddaughter's head.    \"Well, why don't you wipe it up, stupid?\" said Becky. \"'Ow would you  like to pay for Pesach's new coat? It just dripped past his shoulder.\"    \"I'm so sorry, Becky,\" said Esther, striving hard to master the tremor  in her voice. And drawing a house-cloth from a mysterious recess, she  went on her knees in a practical prayer for pardon.    Becky snorted and went back to her sister's engagement-party. For this  was the secret of her gorgeous vesture, of her glittering earrings, and  her massive brooch, as it was the secret of the transformation of the  Belcovitch workshop (and living room) into a hall of dazzling light.  Four separate gaunt bare arms of iron gas-pipe lifted hymeneal torches.  The labels from reels of cotton, pasted above the mantelpiece as indexes  of work done, alone betrayed the past and future of the room. At a long  narrow table, covered with a white table-cloth spread with rum, gin,  biscuits and fruit, and decorated with two wax candles in tall, brass  candlesticks, stood or sat a group of swarthy, neatly-dressed Poles,  most of them in high hats. A few women wearing wigs, silk dresses, and  gold chains wound round half-washed necks, stood about outside the inner  circle. A stooping black-bearded blear-eyed man in a long threadbare  coat and a black skull cap, on either side of which hung a corkscrew  curl, sat abstractedly eating the almonds and raisins, in the central  place of honor which befits a _Maggid_. Before him were pens and ink and  a roll of parchment. This was the engagement contract.    The damages of breach of promise were assessed in advance and without  respect of sex. Whichever side repented of the bargain undertook to pay  ten pounds by way of compensation for the broken pledge. As a nation,  Israel is practical and free from cant. Romance and moonshine are  beautiful things, but behind the glittering veil are always the stern  realities of things and the weaknesses of human nature. The high  contracting parties were signing the document as Becky returned. The  bridegroom, who halted a little on one leg, was a tall sallow man named  Pesach Weingott. He was a boot-maker, who could expound the Talmud and  play the fiddle, but was unable to earn a living. He was marrying Fanny  Belcovitch because his parents-in-law would give him free board and  lodging for a year, and because he liked her. Fanny was a plump, pulpy  girl, not in the prime of youth. Her complexion was fair and her manner  lymphatic, and if she was not so well-favored as her sister, she was  more amiable and pleasant. She could sing sweetly in Yiddish and in  English, and had once been a pantomime fairy at ten shillings a week,  and had even flourished a cutlass as a midshipman. But she had long  since given up the stage, to become her father's right hand woman in the  workshop. She made coats from morning till midnight at a big machine  with a massive treadle, and had pains in her chest even before she fell  in love with Pesach Weingott.    There was a hubbub of congratulation (_Mazzoltov, Mazzoltov_, good  luck), and a palsy of handshaking, when the contract was signed.  Remarks, grave and facetious, flew about in Yiddish, with phrases of  Polish and Russian thrown in for auld lang syne, and cups and jugs were  broken in reminder of the transiency of things mortal. The Belcovitches  had been saving up their already broken crockery for the occasion. The  hope was expressed that Mr. and Mrs. Belcovitch would live to see  \"rejoicings\" on their other daughter, and to see their daughters'  daughters under the _Chuppah_, or wedding-canopy.    Becky's hardened cheek blushed under the oppressive jocularity.  Everybody spoke Yiddish habitually at No. 1 Royal Street, except the  younger generation, and that spoke it to the elder.    \"I always said, no girl of mine should marry a Dutchman.\" It was a  dominant thought of Mr. Belcovitch's, and it rose spontaneously to his  lips at this joyful moment. Next to a Christian, a Dutch Jew stood  lowest in the gradation of potential sons-in-law. Spanish Jews, earliest  arrivals by way of Holland, after the Restoration, are a class apart,  and look down on the later imported _Ashkenazim_, embracing both Poles  and Dutchmen in their impartial contempt. But this does not prevent the  Pole and the Dutchman from despising each other. To a Dutch or Russian  Jew, the \"Pullack,\" or Polish Jew, is a poor creature; and scarce  anything can exceed the complacency with which the \"Pullack\" looks down  upon the \"Litvok\" or Lithuanian, the degraded being whose Shibboleth is  literally Sibboleth, and who says \"ee\" where rightly constituted persons  say \"oo.\" To mimic the mincing pronunciation of the \"Litvok\" affords the  \"Pullack\" a sense of superiority almost equalling that possessed by the  English Jew, whose mispronunciation of the Holy Tongue is his title to  rank far above all foreign varieties. Yet a vein of brotherhood runs  beneath all these feelings of mutual superiority; like the cliqueism  which draws together old clo' dealers, though each gives fifty per cent,  more than any other dealer in the trade. The Dutch foregather in a  district called \"The Dutch Tenters;\" they eat voraciously, and almost  monopolize the ice-cream, hot pea, diamond-cutting, cucumber, herring,  and cigar trades. They are not so cute as the Russians. Their women "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1271"],[0,"Bygone Beliefs: Being a Series of Excursions in the Byways of Thought (#5)"],[1,"party, who feared the loss of  their rights; and, urged thereto, it is said, by a rejected applicant  for membership of the Order, the mob made an onslaught on the  Brotherhood's place of assembly and burnt it to the ground. One account  has it that PYTHAGORAS himself died in the conflagration, a sacrifice  to the mad fury of the mob. According to another account--and we like to  believe that this is the true one--he escaped to Tarentum, from which he  was banished, to find an asylum in Metapontum, where he lived his last  years in peace.    The Pythagorean Order was broken up, but the bonds of brotherhood still  existed between its members. \"One of them who had fallen upon sickness  and poverty was kindly taken in by an innkeeper. Before dying he traced  a few mysterious signs (the pentagram, no doubt) on the door of the inn  and said to the host: 'Do not be uneasy, one of my brothers will pay my  debts.' A year afterwards, as a stranger was passing by this inn he saw  the signs and said to the host: 'I am a Pythagorean; one of my brothers  died here; tell me what I owe you on his account.'\"(1)        (1) EDOUARD SCHURE: _Op. cit_., p. 174.      In endeavouring to estimate the worth of PYTHAGORAS' discoveries and  teaching, Mr FRANKLAND writes, with reference to his achievements in  geometry: \"Even after making a considerable allowance for his pupils'  share, the Master's geometrical work calls for much admiration\"; and,  \"... it cannot be far wrong to suppose that it was Pythagoras' wont  to insist upon proofs, and so to secure that rigour which gives to  mathematics its honourable position amongst the sciences.\" And of his  work in arithmetic, music, and astronomy, the same author writes: \"...  everywhere he appears to have inaugurated genuinely scientific methods,  and to have laid the foundations of a high and liberal education\";  adding, \"For nearly a score of centuries, to the very close of the  Middle Ages, the four Pythagorean subjects of study--arithmetic,  geometry, astronomy, music--were the staple educational course, and were  bound together into a fourfold way of knowledge--the Quadrivium.\"(1)  With these words of due praise, our present excursion may fittingly  close.

MEDICINE AND MAGIC    THERE are few tasks at once so instructive and so fascinating as the  tracing of the development of the human mind as manifested in the  evolution of scientific and philosophical theories. And this is,  perhaps, especially true when, as in the case of medicine, this  evolution has followed paths so tortuous, intersected by so many  fantastic byways, that one is not infrequently doubtful as to the true  road. The history of medicine is at once the history of human wisdom and  the history of human credulity and folly, and the romantic element (to  use the expression in its popular acceptation) thus introduced, whilst  making the subject more entertaining, by no means detracts from its  importance considered psychologically.    To whom the honour of having first invented medicines is due is unknown,  the origins of pharmacy being lost in the twilight of myth. OSIRIS and  ISIS, BACCHUS, APOLLO father of the famous physician AESCULAPIUS, and  CHIRON the Centaur, tutor of the latter, are among the many mythological  personages who have been accredited with the invention of physic. It  is certain that the art of compounding medicines is extraordinarily  ancient. There is a papyrus in the British Museum containing medical  prescriptions which was written about 1200 B.C.; and the famous EBERS  papyrus, which is devoted to medical matters, is reckoned to date  from about the year 1550 B.C. It is interesting to note that in the  prescriptions given in this latter papyrus, as seems to have been the  case throughout the history of medicine, the principle that the efficacy  of a medicine is in proportion to its nastiness appears to have been the  main idea. Indeed, many old medicines contained ingredients of the  most disgusting nature imaginable: a mediaeval remedy known as oil of  puppies, made by cutting up two newly-born puppies and boiling them with  one pound of live earthworms, may be cited as a comparatively pleasant  example of the remedies (?) used in the days when all sorts of excreta  were prescribed as medicines.(1)      (1) See the late Mr A. C. WOOTTON'S excellent work, _Chronicles of  Pharmacy_ (2 vols, 1910), to which I gladly acknowledge my indebtedness.      Presumably the oldest theory concerning the causation of disease is that  which attributes all the ills of mankind to the malignant operations of  evil spirits, a theory which someone has rather fancifully suggested is  not so erroneous after all, if we may be allowed to apply the term \"evil  spirits\" to the microbes of modern bacteriology. Remnants of this theory  (which does--shall I say?--conceal a transcendental truth), that is,  in its original form, still survive to the present day in various  superstitious customs, whose absurdity does not need emphasising: for  example, the use of red flannel by old-fashioned folk with which to  tie up sore throats--red having once been supposed to be a colour very  angatonistic to evil spirits; so much so that at one time red cloth hung  in the patient's room was much employed as a cure for smallpox!    Medicine and magic have always been closely associated. Indeed, the  greatest name in the history of pharmacy is also what is probably the  greatest name in the history of magic--the reference, of course, being  to PARACELSUS (1493-1541). Until PARACELSUS, partly by his vigorous  invective and partly by his remarkable cures of various diseases,  demolished the old school of medicine, no one dared contest the  authority of GALEN (130-_circa_ 205) and AVICENNA (980--1037). GALEN'S  theory of disease was largely based upon that of the four humours  in man--bile, blood, phlegm, and black bile,--which were regarded as  related to (but not identical with) the four elements--fire, air, water,  and earth,--being supposed to have characters similar to these. Thus, to  bile, as to fire, were attributed the properties of hotness and dryness;  to blood and air those of hotness and moistness; to phlegm and water  those of coldness and moistness; and, finally, black bile, like earth,  was said to be cold and dry. GALEN supposed that an alteration in the  due proportion of these humours gives rise to disease, though he did not  consider this to be its only cause; thus, cancer, it was thought, might  result from an excess of black bile, and rheumatism from an excess of  phlegm. Drugs, GALEN argued, are of efficiency in the curing of disease,  according as they possess one or more of these so-called fundamental  properties, hotness, dryness, coldness, and moistness, whereby it was  considered that an excess of any humour might be counteracted; moreover,  it was further assumed that four degrees of each property exist, and  that only those drugs are of use in curing a disease which contain the  necessary property or properties in the degree proportionate to that  in which the opposite humour or humours are in excess in the patient's  system.    PARACELSUS' views were based upon his theory (undoubtedly true in a  sense) that man is a microcosm, a world in miniature.(1) Now, all things  material, taught PARACELSUS, contain the three principles termed in  alchemistic phraseology salt, sulphur, and mercury. This is true,  therefore, of man: the healthy body, he argued, is a sort of chemical  compound in which these three principles are harmoniously blended (as  in the Macrocosm) in due proportion, whilst disease is due to a  preponderance of one principle, fevers, for example, being the result  of an excess of sulphur (_i.e_. the fiery principle), _etc_. PARACELSUS,  although his theory was not so different from that of GALEN, whose views  he denounced, was thus led to seek for CHEMICAL remedies, containing  these principles in varying proportions; he was not content with  medicinal herbs and minerals in their crude state, but attempted  to extract their effective essences; indeed, he maintained that the  preparation of new and better drugs is the chief business of chemistry.      (1) See the \"Note on the Paracelsian Doctrine of the Microcosm\" below.      This theory of disease and of the efficacy of drugs was complicated by  many fantastic additions;(1) thus there is the \"Archaeus,\" a sort  of benevolent demon, supposed by PARACELSUS to look after all the  unconscious functions of the bodily organism, who has to be taken into  account. PARACELSUS also held the Doctrine of Signatures, according to  which the medicinal value of plants and minerals is indicated by their  external form, or by some sign impressed upon them by the operation of  the stars. A very old example of this belief is to be found in the use  of mandrake (whose roots resemble the human form) by the Hebrews and  Greeks as a cure for sterility; or, to give an instance which is still  accredited by some, the use of eye-bright (_Euphrasia officinalis_, L.,  a plant with a black pupil-like spot in its corolla) for complaints of  the eyes.(2) Allied to this doctrine are such beliefs, once held, as  that the lungs of foxes are good for bronchial troubles, or that the  heart of a lion will endow one with courage; as CORNELIUS AGRIPPA put  it, \"It is well known amongst physicians that brain helps the brain, and  lungs the lungs.\"(3)      (1) The question of PARACELSUS' pharmacy is further complicated by the  fact that this eccentric genius coined many new words (without regard to  the principles of etymology) as names for his medicines, and often used  the same term to stand for quite different bodies. Some of his disciples  maintained that he must not always be understood in a literal sense,  in which probably there is an element of truth.
