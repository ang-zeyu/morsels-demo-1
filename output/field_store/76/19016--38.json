This elucidation of a knotty point being received with such marks of  approval as to put John Willet into a good humour, he contented himself  with repeating to his son his command of silence, and addressing the  stranger, said:    'If you had asked your questions of a grown-up person--of me or any of  these gentlemen--you'd have had some satisfaction, and wouldn't have  wasted breath. Miss Haredale is Mr Geoffrey Haredale's niece.'    'Is her father alive?' said the man, carelessly.    'No,' rejoined the landlord, 'he is not alive, and he is not dead--'    'Not dead!' cried the other.    'Not dead in a common sort of way,' said the landlord.    The cronies nodded to each other, and Mr Parkes remarked in an  undertone, shaking his head meanwhile as who should say, 'let no man  contradict me, for I won't believe him,' that John Willet was in amazing  force to-night, and fit to tackle a Chief Justice.    The stranger suffered a short pause to elapse, and then asked abruptly,  'What do you mean?'    'More than you think for, friend,' returned John Willet. 'Perhaps  there's more meaning in them words than you suspect.'    'Perhaps there is,' said the strange man, gruffly; 'but what the devil  do you speak in such mysteries for? You tell me, first, that a man is  not alive, nor yet dead--then, that he's not dead in a common sort of  way--then, that you mean a great deal more than I think for. To tell  you the truth, you may do that easily; for so far as I can make out, you  mean nothing. What DO you mean, I ask again?'    'That,' returned the landlord, a little brought down from his dignity  by the stranger's surliness, 'is a Maypole story, and has been any time  these four-and-twenty years. That story is Solomon Daisy's story. It  belongs to the house; and nobody but Solomon Daisy has ever told it  under this roof, or ever shall--that's more.'    The man glanced at the parish-clerk, whose air of consciousness and  importance plainly betokened him to be the person referred to, and,  observing that he had taken his pipe from his lips, after a very long  whiff to keep it alight, and was evidently about to tell his story  without further solicitation, gathered his large coat about him, and  shrinking further back was almost lost in the gloom of the spacious  chimney-corner, except when the flame, struggling from under a great  faggot, whose weight almost crushed it for the time, shot upward with a  strong and sudden glare, and illumining his figure for a moment, seemed  afterwards to cast it into deeper obscurity than before.    By this flickering light, which made the old room, with its heavy  timbers and panelled walls, look as if it were built of polished  ebony--the wind roaring and howling without, now rattling the latch  and creaking the hinges of the stout oaken door, and now driving at  the casement as though it would beat it in--by this light, and under  circumstances so auspicious, Solomon Daisy began his tale:    'It was Mr Reuben Haredale, Mr Geoffrey's elder brother--'    Here he came to a dead stop, and made so long a pause that even John  Willet grew impatient and asked why he did not proceed.    'Cobb,' said Solomon Daisy, dropping his voice and appealing to the  post-office keeper; 'what day of the month is this?'    'The nineteenth.'    'Of March,' said the clerk, bending forward, 'the nineteenth of March;  that's very strange.'    In a low voice they all acquiesced, and Solomon went on:    'It was Mr Reuben Haredale, Mr Geoffrey's elder brother, that twenty-two  years ago was the owner of the Warren, which, as Joe has said--not that  you remember it, Joe, for a boy like you can't do that, but because you  have often heard me say so--was then a much larger and better place, and  a much more valuable property than it is now. His lady was lately  dead, and he was left with one child--the Miss Haredale you have been  inquiring about--who was then scarcely a year old.'    Although the speaker addressed himself to the man who had shown so much  curiosity about this same family, and made a pause here as if expecting  some exclamation of surprise or encouragement, the latter made no  remark, nor gave any indication that he heard or was interested in what  was said. Solomon therefore turned to his old companions, whose noses  were brightly illuminated by the deep red glow from the bowls of their  pipes; assured, by long experience, of their attention, and resolved to  show his sense of such indecent behaviour.    'Mr Haredale,' said Solomon, turning his back upon the strange man,  'left this place when his lady died, feeling it lonely like, and went  up to London, where he stopped some months; but finding that place as  lonely as this--as I suppose and have always heard say--he suddenly  came back again with his little girl to the Warren, bringing with him  besides, that day, only two women servants, and his steward, and a  gardener.'    Mr Daisy stopped to take a whiff at his pipe, which was going out,  and then proceeded--at first in a snuffling tone, occasioned by keen  enjoyment of the tobacco and strong pulling at the pipe, and afterwards  with increasing distinctness:    '--Bringing with him two women servants, and his steward, and a  gardener. The rest stopped behind up in London, and were to follow next  day. It happened that that night, an old gentleman who lived at Chigwell  Row, and had long been poorly, deceased, and an order came to me at half  after twelve o'clock at night to go and toll the passing-bell.'    There was a movement in the little group of listeners, sufficiently  indicative of the strong repugnance any one of them would have felt to  have turned out at such a time upon such an errand. The clerk felt and  understood it, and pursued his theme accordingly.    'It WAS a dreary thing, especially as the grave-digger was laid up in  his bed, from long working in a damp soil and sitting down to take his  dinner on cold tombstones, and I was consequently under obligation to go  alone, for it was too late to hope to get any other companion. However,  I wasn't unprepared for it; as the old gentleman had often made it a  request that the bell should be tolled as soon as possible after the  breath was out of his body, and he had been expected to go for some  days. I put as good a face upon it as I could, and muffling myself up  (for it was mortal cold), started out with a lighted lantern in one hand  and the key of the church in the other.'    At this point of the narrative, the dress of the strange man rustled as  if he had turned himself to hear more distinctly. Slightly pointing over  his shoulder, Solomon elevated his eyebrows and nodded a silent inquiry  to Joe whether this was the case. Joe shaded his eyes with his hand and  peered into the corner, but could make out nothing, and so shook his  head.    'It was just such a night as this; blowing a hurricane, raining heavily,  and very dark--I often think now, darker than I ever saw it before or  since; that may be my fancy, but the houses were all close shut and the  folks in doors, and perhaps there is only one other man who knows how  dark it really was. I got into the church, chained the door back so that  it should keep ajar--for, to tell the truth, I didn't like to be shut  in there alone--and putting my lantern on the stone seat in the little  corner where the bell-rope is, sat down beside it to trim the candle.    'I sat down to trim the candle, and when I had done so I could not  persuade myself to get up again, and go about my work. I don't know how  it was, but I thought of all the ghost stories I had ever heard, even  those that I had heard when I was a boy at school, and had forgotten  long ago; and they didn't come into my mind one after another, but  all crowding at once, like. I recollected one story there was in the  village, how that on a certain night in the year (it might be that very  night for anything I knew), all the dead people came out of the ground  and sat at the heads of their own graves till morning. This made me  think how many people I had known, were buried between the church-door  and the churchyard gate, and what a dreadful thing it would be to have  to pass among them and know them again, so earthy and unlike themselves.  I had known all the niches and arches in the church from a child; still,  I couldn't persuade myself that those were their natural shadows which  I saw on the pavement, but felt sure there were some ugly figures hiding  among 'em and peeping out. Thinking on in this way, I began to think of  the old gentleman who was just dead, and I could have sworn, as I looked  up the dark chancel, that I saw him in his usual place, wrapping his  shroud about him and shivering as if he felt it cold. All this time I  sat listening and listening, and hardly dared to breathe. At length  I started up and took the bell-rope in my hands. At that minute there  rang--not that bell, for I had hardly touched the rope--but another!    'I heard the ringing of another bell, and a deep bell too, plainly. It  was only for an instant, and even then the wind carried the sound away,  but I heard it. I listened for a long time, but it rang no more. I had  heard of corpse candles, and at last I persuaded myself that this must  be a corpse bell tolling of itself at midnight for the dead. I tolled my  bell--how, or how long, I don't know--and ran home to bed as fast as I  could touch the ground.    'I was up early next morning after a restless night, and told the story  to my neighbours. Some were serious and some made light of it; I don't  think anybody believed it real. But, that morning, Mr Reuben Haredale  was found murdered in his bedchamber; and in his hand was a piece of the  cord attached to an alarm-bell outside the roof, which hung in his room  and had been cut asunder, no doubt by the murderer, when he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9172"],[0,"A Study of Association in Insanity (#4)"],[1,"found it necessary in the end to provide a special group  for unclassified reactions, into which falls more than one-third of  the total number of individual reactions; and, in the second place, in  at least two of our groups the play of personal equation has not been  entirely eliminated, so that there is still a possibility of error to  the extent of five per cent of individual reactions, which means  approximately one per cent of the total number of reactions. We have  found, however, that in spite of these shortcomings the classification  here proposed is more serviceable than others which, though more  comprehensive, are at the same time lacking in definiteness.    Our classification consists of the following classes, groups and  subdivisions:    I. _Common reactions._    1. Specific reactions.    2. Non-specific reactions.    II. _Doubtful reactions._    III. _Individual reactions._    1. Normal reactions.    2. Pathological reactions:      A. Derivatives of stimulus words.      B. Partial dissociation:        (a) Non-specific reactions.        (b) Sound reactions:          a. Words.          b. Neologisms.        (c) Word complements.        (d) Particles of speech.      C. Complete dissociation:        (a) Perseveration:          a. Association to preceding stimulus.          b. Association to preceding reaction.          c. Repetition of preceding stimulus.          d. Repetition of previous stimulus.          e. Repetition of preceding reaction.          f. Repetition of previous reaction.          g. Reaction repeated five times (stereotypy).        (b) Neologisms without sound relation.    3. Unclassified.        § 3. NON-SPECIFIC REACTIONS; DOUBTFUL REACTIONS.      *Non-specific Reactions.*--It has already been intimated that common  reactions are in the vast majority of instances to be regarded as  normal. From amongst them, however, a fairly definite group can be  separated out which seems to possess some pathological significance,  namely, the group which we have termed non-specific.    In this group are placed words which are so widely applicable as to  serve as more or less appropriate reactions to almost any of our  stimulus words. That such reactions are in value inferior to the  remaining group of common reactions, which we have termed, in  contradistinction, _specific reactions_, is perhaps sufficiently  obvious; we shall speak later, however, of their occurrence in both  normal and insane cases.    It is not always easy to judge whether or not a given reaction should  be classed as non-specific. A study of our material made with special  reference to this type of reactions has enabled us to select the  following list of words, any of which, occurring in response to any  stimulus word, is classed as a non-specific reaction:    article, articles  bad  beautiful, beauty  fine  good, goodness  great  happiness, happy  large  man  necessary, necessity  nice    object (noun)  people  person  pleasant, pleasantness, pleasing, pleasure  pretty  small  thinking, thought, thoughts  unnecessary  unpleasant  use, used, useful, usefulness, useless, uselessness, uses, using  woman  work    It should be mentioned that some of these words occur as reactions to  one or several stimulus words with such frequency  (_citizen--man_, value 27.8 per cent; _health--good_, value  9.4 per cent) as to acquire in such instances a value as high as that  of strictly specific reactions.    *Doubtful Reactions* have already been defined (p.40): any  reaction word which is not found in the table in its identical form,  but which is a grammatical variant or derivative of a word found  there, is placed in this group.        § 4. INDIVIDUAL REACTIONS; EXPLANATION OF GROUPS AND METHODS OF  APPLICATION.      *Normal Reactions.*--Inasmuch as the frequency tables do not exhaust all  normal possibilities of reaction, a certain number of reactions which  are essentially normal are to be found among the individual reactions.  In order to separate these from the pathological reactions, we have  compiled an appendix to the frequency tables, consisting mainly of  specific definitions of groups of words to be included under each  stimulus word in our list. This appendix will be found at the end of  this paper.    A word of explanation is perhaps due as to the manner in which the  appendix has been compiled. It was developed in a purely empirical  way, the basis being such individual reactions, given by both normal  and insane subjects, as seemed in our judgment to be obviously normal.    It must be acknowledged that the appendix falls short of all that  might be desired. In the first place, its use involves to some slight  extent the play of personal equation, and it therefore constitutes a  source of error; in the second place, it is in some respects too  inclusive while in other respects it is not sufficiently so. However,  the error due to personal equation is slight; the inclusion of certain  \"far-fetched\" or even frankly pathological reactions may be discounted  by bearing in mind that the general value of this group is not equal  to that of the group of common reactions; and the number of strictly  normal reactions which are not included is after all small. Our  experience has shown us that the appendix constitutes an important aid  in the analysis of individual reactions.    *Pathological Reactions. Derivatives of Stimulus Words.*--We  place here any reaction which is a grammatical variant or derivative  of a stimulus word. The tendency to give such reactions seems to be  dependent upon a suspension or inhibition of the normal process by  which the stimulus word excites the production of a new concept, for  we have here not a production of a new concept but a mere change in  the form of the stimulus word. As examples of such reactions may be  mentioned: _eating--eatables_, _short--shortness_,  _sweet--sweetened_, _quiet--quietness_.    *Partial Dissociation.*--We have employed the term dissociation  to indicate a rupture of that bond--whatever be its nature-which may  be supposed to exist normally between stimulus and reaction and which  causes normal persons to respond in the majority of instances by  common reactions. And we speak of partial dissociation where there is  still an obvious, though weak and superficial, connection. Under this  heading we can differentiate four types:    *Non-specific Reactions* have already been defined; we  distinguish those in this class from those in the class of common  reactions by means of the frequency tables.    *Sound Reactions.*--This type requires no explanation; the main  difficulty is to decide what degree of sound similarity between  stimulus and reaction should be deemed sufficient for placing a  reaction under this heading. The total number of different sounds  used in language articulation is, of course, small, so that any two  words are liable to present considerable chance similarity. Some  time ago we estimated the average degree of sound similarity between  stimulus words and reaction words in a series of one hundred  test records obtained from normal persons; we found that on  the average 14.53 per cent of the sounds of the stimulus words  were reproduced, in the same order, in the reaction word. Our  experience finally led us to adopt the following general rule: A  reaction is to be placed under this heading when fifty per cent of  the sounds of the shorter word of the pair are identical with sounds  of the longer word and are ranged in the same order.    Among sound reactions we occasionally find *neologisms*; for these a  separate heading is provided. Possibly their occurrence may be taken  as an indication of an exaggerated tendency to respond by sound  reactions.    *Word Compliments.*--Here we include any reaction which, added to the  stimulus word, forms a word, a proper name, or a compound word in  common use.    *Particles of Speech.*--Under this heading we include articles,  numerals, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, adverbs of time, place and  degree, conjunctions, prepositions, and interjections.    *Complete Dissociation.*--Here are included reactions which  appear to be entirely unrelated to the corresponding stimulus words;  in the case of such reactions the stimulus words seem to act, as  Aschaffenburg has pointed out, merely as signals for discharge. This  subdivision contains several types of reactions which seem to be  dependent upon the phenomenon of perseveration; it contains also the  rather important type of neologisms.    The phenomenon of *preservation* occurs in cases in which one may  observe an abnormal immobility of attention. To react normally to a  series of stimulus words requires on the part of the subject, in the  first place, a certain alertness in order that he may grasp quickly  and clearly the meaning of each word, and, in the second place, a  prompt shifting of the mind from one reaction to the next. When such  mental mobility is lacking the subject is liable to react not by a  response adjusted to the stimulus word, but either by repeating a  previous stimulus or reaction, or by giving a word associated to the  preceding stimulus or reaction.    The names of the different types of reactions included under the  heading of perseveration are sufficiently descriptive; we shall here  refer only to those which require further definition.    *Association to Preceding Stimulus.*--Here is placed any reaction  that is shown by the frequency tables to be related to the stimulus  preceding the one in question. Seeming or even obvious relationship,  if not established by reference to the frequency tables, is  disregarded. In the tables, however, the combination may not exist in  direct order but only in reverse order, in which case the reaction is  included here. The following examples may serve as illustrations:    _thief--night_  _lion--pocket-book_    _Lion--pocket-book_ is not found in the frequency tables, and is,  therefore, an individual"]]]
