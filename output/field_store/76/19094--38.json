[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11128"],[0,"The Red Thumb Mark (#5)"],[1,"  finger-print as a kind of magical touchstone, a final proof, beyond  which inquiry need not go. Now, this is an entire mistake. A  finger-print is merely a fact--a very important and significant one, I  admit--but still a fact, which, like any other fact, requires to be  weighed and measured with reference to its evidential value.\"    \"And what do you propose to do first?\"    \"I shall first satisfy myself that the suspected thumb-print is  identical in character with that of Reuben Hornby--of which, however,  I have very little doubt, for the finger-print experts may fairly be  trusted in their own speciality.\"    \"And then?\"    \"I shall collect fresh facts, in which I look to you for assistance,  and, if we have finished breakfast, I may as well induct you into your  new duties.\"    He rose and rang the bell, and then, fetching from the office four  small, paper-covered notebooks, laid them before me on the table.    \"One of these books,\" said he, \"we will devote to data concerning Reuben  Hornby. You will find out anything you can--anything, mind, no matter  how trivial or apparently irrelevant--in any way connected with him and  enter it in this book.\" He wrote on the cover \"Reuben Hornby\" and passed  the book to me. \"In this second book you will, in like manner, enter  anything that you can learn about Walter Hornby, and, in the third book,  data concerning John Hornby. As to the fourth book, you will keep that  for stray facts connected with the case but not coming under either of  the other headings. And now let us look at the product of Polton's  industry.\"    He took from his assistant's hand a photograph ten inches long by eight  broad, done on glazed bromide paper and mounted flatly on stiff card. It  showed a greatly magnified _facsimile_ of one of the thumb-prints, in  which all the minute details, such as the orifices of the sweat glands  and trifling irregularities in the ridges, which, in the original, could  be seen only with the aid of a lens, were plainly visible to the naked  eye. Moreover, the entire print was covered by a network of fine black  lines, by which it was divided into a multitude of small squares, each  square being distinguished by a number.    \"Excellent, Polton,\" said Thorndyke approvingly; \"a most admirable  enlargement. You see, Jervis, we have photographed the thumb-print in  contact with a numbered micrometer divided into square twelfths of an  inch. The magnification is eight diameters, so that the squares are here  each two-thirds of an inch in diameter. I have a number of these  micrometers of different scales, and I find them invaluable in examining  cheques, doubtful signatures and such like. I see you have packed up the  camera and the microscope, Polton; have you put in the micrometer?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" replied Polton, \"and the six-inch objective and the  low-power eye-piece. Everything is in the case; and I have put 'special  rapid' plates into the dark-slides in case the light should be bad.\"    \"Then we will go forth and beard the Scotland Yard lions in their den,\"  said Thorndyke, putting on his hat and gloves.    \"But surely,\" said I, \"you are not going to drag that great microscope  to Scotland Yard, when you only want eight diameters. Haven't you a  dissecting microscope or some other portable instrument?\"    \"We have a most delightful instrument of the dissecting type, of  Polton's own make--he shall show it to you. But I may have need of a  more powerful instrument--and here let me give you a word of warning:  whatever you may see me do, make no comments before the officials. We  are seeking information, not giving it, you understand.\"    At this moment the little brass knocker on the inner door--the outer  oak being open--uttered a timid and apologetic rat-tat.    \"Who the deuce can that be?\" muttered Thorndyke, replacing the  microscope on the table. He strode across to the door and opened it  somewhat brusquely, but immediately whisked his hat off, and I then  perceived a lady standing on the threshold.    \"Dr. Thorndyke?\" she inquired, and as my colleague bowed, she continued,  \"I ought to have written to ask for an appointment but the matter is  rather urgent--it concerns Mr. Reuben Hornby and I only learned from him  this morning that he had consulted you.\"    \"Pray come in,\" said Thorndyke. \"Dr. Jervis and I were just setting out  for Scotland Yard on this very business. Let me present you to my  colleague, who is working up the case with me.\"    Our visitor, a tall handsome girl of twenty or thereabouts, returned my  bow and remarked with perfect self-possession, \"My name is Gibson--Miss  Juliet Gibson. My business is of a very simple character and need not  detain you many minutes.\"    She seated herself in the chair that Thorndyke placed for her, and  continued in a brisk and business-like manner--    \"I must tell you who I am in order to explain my visit to you. For the  last six years I have lived with Mr. and Mrs. Hornby, although I am no  relation to them. I first came to the house as a sort of companion to  Mrs. Hornby, though, as I was only fifteen at the time, I need hardly  say that my duties were not very onerous; in fact, I think Mrs. Hornby  took me because I was an orphan without the proper means of getting a  livelihood, and she had no children of her own.    \"Three years ago I came into a little fortune which rendered me  independent; but I had been so happy with my kind friends that I asked  to be allowed to remain with them, and there I have been ever since in  the position of an adopted daughter. Naturally, I have seen a great deal  of their nephews, who spend a good part of their time at the house, and  I need not tell you that the horrible charge against Reuben has fallen  upon us like a thunderbolt. Now, what I have come to say to you is this:  I do not believe that Reuben stole those diamonds. It is entirely out of  character with all my previous experience of him. I am convinced that he  is innocent, and I am prepared to back my opinion.\"    \"In what way?\" asked Thorndyke.    \"By supplying the sinews of war,\" replied Miss Gibson. \"I understand  that legal advice and assistance involves considerable expense.\"    \"I am afraid you are quite correctly informed,\" said Thorndyke.    \"Well, Reuben's pecuniary resources are, I am sure, quite small, so it  is necessary for his friends to support him, and I want you to promise  me that nothing shall be left undone that might help to prove his  innocence if I make myself responsible for any costs that he is unable  to meet. I should prefer, of course, not to appear in the matter, if it  could be avoided.\"    \"Your friendship is of an eminently practical kind, Miss Gibson,\" said  my colleague, with a smile. \"As a matter of fact, the costs are no  affair of mine. If the occasion arose for the exercise of your  generosity you would have to approach Mr. Reuben's solicitor through the  medium of your guardian, Mr. Hornby, and with the consent of the  accused. But I do not suppose the occasion will arise, although I am  very glad you called, as you may be able to give us valuable assistance  in other ways. For example, you might answer one or two apparently  impertinent questions.\"    \"I should not consider any question impertinent that you considered  necessary to ask,\" our visitor replied.    \"Then,\" said Thorndyke, \"I will venture to inquire if any special  relations exist between you and Mr. Reuben.\"    \"You look for the inevitable motive in a woman,\" said Miss Gibson,  laughing and flushing a little. \"No, there have been no tender passages  between Reuben and me. We are merely old and intimate friends; in fact,  there is what I may call a tendency in another direction--Walter  Hornby.\"    \"Do you mean that you are engaged to Mr. Walter?\"    \"Oh, no,\" she replied; \"but he has asked me to marry him--he has asked  me, in fact, more than once; and I really believe that he has a sincere  attachment to me.\"    She made this latter statement with an odd air, as though the thing  asserted were curious and rather incredible, and the tone was evidently  noticed by Thorndyke as well as me for he rejoined--    \"Of course he has. Why not?\"    \"Well, you see,\" replied Miss Gibson, \"I have some six hundred a year of  my own and should not be considered a bad match for a young man like  Walter, who has neither property nor expectations, and one naturally  takes that into account. But still, as I have said, I believe he is  quite sincere in his professions and not merely attracted by my money.\"    \"I do not find your opinion at all incredible,\" said Thorndyke, with a  smile, \"even if Mr. Walter were quite a mercenary young man--which, I  take it, he is not.\"    Miss Gibson flushed very prettily as she replied--    \"Oh, pray do not trouble to pay me compliments; I assure you I am by no  means insensible of my merits. But with regard to Walter Hornby, I  should be sorry to apply the term 'mercenary' to him, and yet--well, I  have never met a young man who showed a stronger appreciation of the  value of money. He means to succeed in life and I have no doubt he  will.\"    \"And do I understand that you refused him?\"    \"Yes. My feelings towards him are quite friendly, but not of such a  nature as to allow me to contemplate marrying him.\"    \"And now, to return for a moment to Mr. Reuben. You have known him for  some years?\"    \"I have known him intimately for six years,\" replied Miss Gibson.    \"And what sort of character do you give him?\"    \"Speaking from my own observation of him,\" she replied, \"I can say that  I have never known him to tell an untruth or do a dishonourable deed. As  to theft, it is merely ridiculous. His habits have always been  inexpensive and frugal, he is unambitious to a fault, and in respect to  the 'main chance' his indifference is as conspicuous as Walter's  keenness. He is a generous man, too, although careful and industrious.\"    \"Thank you, Miss Gibson,\" said Thorndyke. \"We"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11153"],[0,"No Hero (#5)"],[1," his \"best girl\"; next moment I was given to  understand that he meant his bride, who was ten times too good for him,  with further trivialities to which the dressing-bell put a timely  period. There was no sign of my Etonian when I went upstairs.    As I dressed in my small low room, with its sloping ceiling of varnished  wood, at the top of the house, I felt that after all I had learnt  nothing really new respecting that disturbing young gentleman. Quinby  had already proved himself such an arrant gossip as to discount every  word that he had said before I placed him in his proper type: it is one  which I have encountered elsewhere, that of the middle-aged bachelor who  will and must talk, and he had confessed his celibacy almost in his  first breath; but a more pronounced specimen of the type I am in no  hurry to meet again. If, however, there was some comfort in the thought  of his more than probable exaggerations, there was none at all in the  knowledge that these would be, if they had not already been, poured into  every tolerant ear in the place, if anything more freely than into mine.    I was somewhat late for dinner, but the scandalous couple were later  still, and all the evening I saw nothing of them. That, however, was  greatly due to this fellow Quinby, whose determined offices one could  hardly disdain after once accepting favours from him. In the press after  dinner I saw his ferret's face peering this way and that, a good head  higher than any other, and the moment our eyes met he began elbowing his  way toward me. Only an ingrate would have turned and fled; and for the  next hour or two I suffered Quinby to exploit my wounds and me for a  good deal more than our intrinsic value. To do the man justice, however,  I had no fault to find with the very pleasant little circle into which  he insisted on ushering me, at one end of the glazed veranda, and should  have enjoyed my evening but for an inquisitive anxiety to get in touch  with the unsuspecting pair. Meanwhile the lilt of a waltz had mingled  with the click of billiard balls and the talking and laughing which make  a summer's night vocal in that outpost of pleasure on the silent  heights; and some of our party had gone off to dance. In the end I  followed them, sticks and all; but there was no Bob Evers among the  dancers, nor in the billiard-room, nor anywhere else indoors.    Then, last of all, I looked where Quinby had advised me to look, and  there sure enough, on the almost deserted terrace, were the couple whom  I had come several hundred miles to put asunder. Hitherto I had only  realised the distasteful character of my task; now at a glance I had my  first inkling of its difficulty; and there ended the premature  satisfaction with which I had learnt that there was \"something in\" the  rumour which had reached Catherine's ears.    There was no moon, but the mountain stars were the brightest I have ever  seen in Europe. The mountains themselves stood back, as it were,  darkling and unobtrusive; all that was left of the Matterhorn was a  towering gap in the stars; and in the faint cold light stood my  friends, somewhat close together, and I thought I saw the red tips of  two cigarettes. There was at least no mistaking the long loose limbs in  the light overcoat. And because a woman always looks relatively taller  than a man, this woman looked nearly as tall as this lad.    \"Bob Evers? You may not remember me, but my name's Clephane--Duncan, you  know!\"    I felt the veriest scoundrel, and yet the words came out as smoothly as  I have written them, as if to show me that I had been a potential  scoundrel all my life.    \"Duncan Clephane? Why, of course I remember you. I should think I did! I  say, though, you must have had a shocking time!\"    Bob's voice was quite quiet for all his astonishment, his manner a  miracle, though it was too dark to read the face; and his right hand  held tenderly to mine, as his eyes fell upon my sticks, while his left  poised a steady cigarette. And now I saw that there was only one red tip  after all.    \"I read your name in the visitors' book,\" said I, feeling too big a  brute to acknowledge the boy's solicitude for me. \"I--I felt certain it  must be you.\"    \"How splendid!\" cried the great fellow in his easy, soft, unconscious  voice, \"By the way, may I introduce you to Mrs. Lascelles? Captain  Clephane's one of our very oldest friends, just back from the Front, and  precious nearly blown to bits!\"          CHAPTER III    FIRST BLOOD      Mrs. Lascelles and I exchanged our bows. For a dangerous woman there was  a rather striking want of study in her attire. Over the garment which I  believe is called a \"rain-coat,\" the night being chilly, she had put on  her golf-cape as well, and the effect was a little heterogeneous. It  also argued qualities other than those for which I was naturally on the  watch. Of the lady's face I could see even less than of Bob's, for the  hood of the cape was upturned into a cowl, and even in Switzerland the  stars are only stars. But while I peered she let me hear her voice, and  a very rich one it was--almost deep in tone--the voice of a woman who  would sing contralto.    \"Have you really been fighting?\" she asked, in a way that was either put  on, or else the expression of a more understanding sympathy than one  usually provoked; for pity and admiration, and even a helpless woman's  envy, might all have been discovered by an ear less critical and more  charitable than mine.    \"Like anything!\" answered Bob, in his unaffected speech.    \"Until they knocked me out,\" I felt bound to add, \"and that,  unfortunately, was before very long.\"    \"You must have been dreadfully wounded!\" said Mrs. Lascelles, raising  her eyes from my sticks and gazing at me, I fancied, with some  intentness; but at her expression I could only guess.    \"Bowled over on Spion Kop,\" said Bob, \"and fairly riddled as he lay.\"    \"But only about the legs, Mrs. Lascelles,\" I explained; \"and you see I  didn't lose either, so I've no cause to complain. I had hardly a graze  higher up.\"    \"Were you up there the whole of that awful day?\" asked Mrs. Lascelles,  on a low but thrilling note.    \"I'd got to be,\" said I, trying to lighten the subject with a laugh. But  Bob's tone was little better.    \"So he went staggering about among his men,\" he must needs chime in,  with other superfluities, \"for I remember reading all about it in the  papers, and boasting like anything about having known you, Duncan, but  feeling simply sick with envy all the time. I say, you'll be a  tremendous hero up here, you know! I'm awfully glad you've come. It's  quite funny, all the same. I suppose you came to get bucked up? He  couldn't have gone to a better place, could he, Mrs. Lascelles?\"    \"Indeed he could not. I only wish we could empty the hotel and fill  every bed with our poor wounded!\"    I do not know why I should have felt so much surprised. I had made unto  myself my own image of Mrs. Lascelles, and neither her appearance, nor a  single word that had fallen from her, was in the least in keeping with  my conception. Prepared for a certain type of woman, I was quite  confounded by its unconventional embodiment, and inclined to believe  that this was not the type at all. I ought to have known life better.  The most scheming mind may well entertain an enthusiasm for arms,  genuine enough in itself, at a martial crisis, and a natural manner is  by no means incompatible with the cardinal vices. That manner and that  enthusiasm were absolutely all that I as yet knew in favour of this Mrs.  Lascelles; but they were enough to cause me irritation. I wished to be  honest with somebody; let me at least be honestly inimical to her. I  took out my cigarette-case, and when about to help myself, handed it,  with a vile pretence at impulse, to Mrs. Lascelles instead.    Mrs. Lascelles thanked me, in a higher key, but declined.    \"Don't you smoke?\" I asked blandly.    \"Sometimes.\"    \"Ah! then I wasn't mistaken. I thought I saw two cigarettes just now.\"    Indeed, I had first smelt and afterward discovered the second cigarette  smouldering on the ground. Bob was smoking his still. The chances were  that they had both been lighted at the same time; therefore the other  had been thrown away unfinished at my approach. And that was one more  variation from the type of my confident preconceptions.    Young Robin had meanwhile had a quick eye on us both, and the stump of  his own cigarette was glowing between a firmer pair of lips than I had  looked for in that boyish face.    \"It's so funny,\" said he (but there was no fun in his voice), \"the  prejudice some people have against ladies smoking. Why shouldn't they?  Where's the harm?\"    Now there is no new plea to be advanced on either side of this eternal  question, nor is it one upon which I ever felt strongly, but just then I  felt tempted to speak as though I did. I will not now dissect my motive,  but it was vaguely connected with my mission, and not unrighteous from  that standpoint. I said it was not a question of harm at all, but of  what one admired in a woman, and what one did not: a man loved to look  upon a woman as something above and beyond him, and there could be no  doubt that the gap seemed a little less when both were smoking like twin  funnels. That, I thought, was the adverse point of view; I did not say  that it was mine.    \"I'm glad to hear it,\" said Bob Evers, with the faintest coldness in his  tone, though I fancied he was fuming within, and admired both his  chivalry and his self-control. \"To me it's quite funny. I call it sheer  selfishness. We enjoy a cigarette ourselves; why shouldn't they? We  don't force them to be teetotal, do we? Is it bad form for a lady to  drink a glass of wine? You mightn't bicycle once, might you, Mrs.  Lascelles? I daresay Captain Clephane doesn't approve of that yet!\"    \"That's hitting below the belt,\" said I, laughing. \"I wasn't giving"]]]
