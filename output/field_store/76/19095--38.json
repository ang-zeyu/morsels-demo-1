'How pleased your wife will be, and the poor little  children! Oh, it is a shame that you ever had to go away from them! I  mean to ask papa to let you go back, some day.'    'Missis said that she would send down money for me, as soon as they  could get it together,' said Tom. 'Young Mas'r George, he said he'd come  for me. He gave me this dollar as a sign,' and Tom drew the precious  dollar from under his coat.    'Oh, he is sure to come, then,' said Eva, 'I am so glad.'    'I wanted to send a letter, you see, to let 'em know where I was, and  tell poor Chloe that I was well off, 'cause she felt so dreadful, poor  soul.'    'I say, Tom,' said Mr. St. Clare, coming in at the door at this minute.    Tom and Eva both started.    'What's this?' Mr. St. Clare went on, coming up and looking at the  slate.    'Oh, it's Tom's letter. I'm helping him to write it,' said Eva. 'Isn't  it nice?'    'I wouldn't discourage either of you,' said her father; 'but I rather  think, Tom, you had better let me write your letter for you. I'll do it  when I come home from my ride.'    'It is very important that he should write,' said Eva, 'because his  mistress is going to send money to buy him back again, you know, papa.  He told me they had said so.'    Mr. St. Clare thought in his heart that very likely this meant nothing.  He thought it was only one of these things which good-natured people  said to their slaves to comfort them when they were taken away from  their dear ones to be sold. He did not really believe Mrs. Shelby  meant to buy Tom back again. However, he did not say so out loud, but  just told Tom to get the horses ready for a ride.    That evening the letter was written, and Uncle Tom carried it joyfully  to the post-office.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XII      GEORGE FIGHTS FOR FREEDOM      The day after George and Eliza met each other once more at the end of so  many sad months of parting, was a very happy one in the Quaker house.    The two had much to say to each other. George had to tell how he had  escaped from his cruel master, and how he had followed Eliza all the way  and at last found her. Then there were plans to make for going on  towards Canada. It was arranged that they should start that night at ten  o'clock. 'The pursuers are hard after thee, we must not delay,' said  Simeon.    Rachel was happy and busy, packing up food and clothes for them to take  on the journey.    Late in the afternoon another Quaker, called Phineas, came with the  dreadful news that the wicked men, whom Haley had sent to catch Eliza,  were only a few miles away.    So George and Eliza decided to start as soon as it was dark. A little  while after supper a large covered waggon drew up before the door. They  got in and the waggon drove off.    On and on, all through the dark night they drove. About three o'clock,  George heard the click of a horse's hoof coming behind them.    'That's Simeon,' said Phineas, who was driving, as he pulled up the  horses to listen.    'Halloa, there, Simeon,' he shouted, 'what news? Are they coming?'    'Yes, right on behind, eight or ten of them.'    'Oh! what shall we do?' groaned Eliza.    But Phineas knew the road well. He lashed the horses till they flew  along, the waggon rattling and jumping over the hard road behind them.    [Illustration]    On they went till they came to a place where the rocks rose straight up  from the road like a wall. It seemed impossible for any one to climb up  there. But Phineas knew a way.    He stopped the horses. 'Here, Simeon,' he said, 'take the waggon, and  drive on as fast as thou canst, and bring back help. Now follow me,' he  said to the others, 'quick, for your lives. Run now, if you you ever did  run.'    Quicker than we can say it, they were following him up a tiny narrow  path to the top of the rocks, and Simeon was galloping the horses with  the empty waggon along the road.    'We are pretty safe here,' said Phineas, when they had reached the top.  'Only one person can come up that path at a time. If any one tries it,  shoot him.'    The men who were chasing them had now arrived at the foot of of the  rocks. They were led by a big man called Tom Loker, and another  mean-looking little man, whom Haley had sent.    After some hunting about, they found the path, and, headed by Tom Loker,  began to climb up.    'Come up if you like,' George called out, 'but if you do we will shoot  you.'    For answer, the little man took aim at George, and fired.    Eliza screamed, but the shot did not hurt him. It passed close to his  hair, nearly touched her cheek, and, struck a tree behind.    Tom Loker came on. George waited until he was near enough, then he  fired. The shot hit him in the side. But, though wounded, he would not  go back. With a yell like that of a mad bull he came leaping on, and  sprang right in among them.    Quakers are not allowed to use guns and pistols, so Phineas had been  standing back while George shot. Now he sprang forward. As Tom Loker  landed in the middle of them, he gave him a great push, saying, 'Friend,  thee isn't wanted here.'    Down fell Tom Loker, down, down the steep side of the rock. He crashed  and crackled among trees, bushes, logs, loose stones, till he lay  bruised and groaning far below. The fall might have killed him, had it  not been broken by his clothes catching on the branches of a large tree.    Cruel people are, very often, cowardly too. When the men saw their  leader first wounded, and then thrown down, they all ran away.    Mounting their horses, they rode off as fast as they could, leaving Tom  Loker lying on the ground wounded and groaning with pain.    As soon as Phineas and the others saw that the wicked men had really  ridden away, they climbed down, meaning to walk along the road till they  met Simeon.    They had just reached the bottom, when they saw him coming back with the  waggon and two other men.    'Now we are safe,' cried Phineas joyfully.    'Well, do stop then,' said Eliza, 'and do something for that poor man.  He is groaning dreadfully.'    'It would be no more than Christian,' said George. 'Let us take him with  us.'    They lifted the wounded man gently, as if he had been a friend instead  of a cruel enemy, and laid him in the waggon. Then they all set out once  more.    [Illustration]    A drive of about an hour brought them to a neat farm-house. There the  tired travellers were kindly received and given a good breakfast.    Tom Loker was put into a comfortable bed, far cleaner and softer than  any he had ever slept in before. George and Eliza walked about the  garden hand-in-hand, feeling happy together, and almost safe. They were  so near Canada now.          CHAPTER XIII      AUNT DINAH      Miss Ophelia found that it was no easy matter to bring anything like  order into the St. Clare household. The slaves had been left to  themselves so long, and had grown so untidy, that they were not at all  pleased with Miss Feely, as they called her, for trying to make them be  tidy. However, she had quite made up her mind that order there must be.  She got up at four o'clock in the morning, much to the surprise of the  housemaids. All day long she was busy dusting and tidying, till Mrs. St.  Clare said it made her tired to see cousin Ophelia so busy.          CHAPTER XIV      TOPSY      One morning, while Miss Ophelia was busy, as usual, she heard Mr. St.  Clare calling her from the foot of the stairs.    'Come down here, cousin. I have something to show you.'    'What is it?' said Miss Ophelia, coming down with her sewing in her  hand.    'I have bought something for you. See here,' he said, pulling forward a  little negro girl of about eight or nine years old.    She was quite black. Her round, shining eyes glittered like glass beads.  Her wooly hair was plaited into little tails which stuck out in all  directions. Her clothes were dirty and ragged. Miss Ophelia thought she  had never seen such a dreadful little girl in all her life.    'Cousin, what in the world have you brought that thing here for?' she  asked, in dismay.    'For you to teach, to be sure, and train in the way she should go,' said  Mr. St. Clare, laughing. 'Topsy,' he went on, 'this is your new  mistress. See, now, that you behave yourself.'    'Yes, mas'r,' said Topsy gravely, but her eyes had a wicked twinkle in  them.    'You're going to be good, Topsy, you understand?' said Mr. St. Clare.    'Oh yes, mas'r' said Topsy again, meekly folding her hands, but with  another twinkle in her eyes.    'Now cousin, what is this for? Your house is full of these little  plagues as it is. I get up in the morning and find one asleep behind the  door; see one black head poking out from under the table; another lying  on the mat. They tumble over the kitchen floor, so that a body can't put  their foot down without treading on them. What on earth did you want to  bring this one for?'    'For you to teach, didn't I tell you?'    'I don't want her, I'm sure. I have more to do with them now than I  want.'    'Well the fact is, cousin,' said Mr. St. Clare, drawing her aside, 'she  belonged to some people who were dreadfully cruel and beat her. I  couldn't bear to hear her screaming every day, so I bought her. I will  give her to you. Do try and make something of her.'    'Well, I'll do what I can,' said Miss Ophelia. 'She is fearfully dirty,  and half naked.'    'Well, take her downstairs, and tell somebody to clean her up, and give  her some decent clothes.'    Getting Topsy clean was a very long business. But at last it was done.    Then, sitting down before her, Miss Ophelia began to question her.    'How old are you, Topsy?'    'Dunno, missis,' said she, grinning like an ugly little black doll.    'Don't know how old you are! Did nobody ever tell you? Who was your  mother?'    'Never had none,' said Topsy, with another grin.    'Never had any mother! What do you mean? Where "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11198"],[0,"Christianity and Islam (#5)"],[1," encountered. It was a compromise which affected the most  trivial details of life, and in these matters religious scrupulosity  was carried to a ridiculous point: here we may see the outcome of that  Judaism which, as has been said, was then a definite element in  Eastern Christianity. Together with Jewish, Greek and classical ideas  were also naturally operative, while Persian and other ancient  Oriental conceptions were transmitted to Islam by Christianity: these  instances I have collectively termed Christian because Christianity  then represented the whole of later classical intellectualism, which  influenced Islam for the most part through Christianity.    It seems that the communication of these ideas to Muhammedanism was  impeded by the necessity of translating them not only into a kindred  language, but into one of wholly different linguistic structure. For  Muhammedanism the difficulty was lessened by the fact that it had  learned Christianity in Syria and Persia through the Semitic dialect  known as Aramaic, by which Greek and Persian culture had been  transmitted to the Arabs before the rise of Islam. In this case, as in  many others, the history of language runs on parallel lines with the  history of civilisation. The necessities of increasing civilisation  had introduced many Aramaic words to the Arabic vocabulary before  Muhammed's day: these importations increased considerably when the  Arabs entered a wider and more complex civilisation and were  especially considerable where intellectual culture was concerned. Even  Greek terms made their way into Arabic through Aramaic. This natural  dependency of Arabic upon Aramaic, which in turn was connected with  Greek as the rival Christian vernacular in these regions, is alone  sufficient evidence that Christianity exerted a direct influence upon  Muhammedanism. Moreover, as we have seen, the Qoran itself regarded  Christians as being in possession of divine wisdom, and some reference  both to Christianity and to Judaism was necessary to explain the many  unintelligible passages of the Qoran. Allusions were made to texts and  statements in the Thora and the Gospels, and God was represented as  constantly appealing to earlier revelations of Himself. Thus it was  only natural that interpreters should study these scriptures and ask  counsel of their possessors. Of primary importance was the fact that  both Christians and Jews, and the former in particular, accepted  Muhammedanism by thousands, and formed a new intellectual class of  ability infinitely superior to that of the original Muslims and able  to attract the best elements of the Arab nationality to their  teaching. It was as impossible for these apostate Christians to  abandon their old habits of thought as it was hopeless to expect any  sudden change in the economic conditions under which they lived.  Christian theories of God and the world naturally assumed a Muhammedan  colouring and thus the great process of accommodating Christianity to  Muhammedanism was achieved. The Christian contribution to this end was  made partly directly and partly by teaching, and in the intellectual  as well as in the economic sphere the ultimate ideal was inevitably  dictated by the superior culture of Christianity. The Muhammedans were  thus obliged to accept Christian hypotheses on theological points and  the fundaments of Christian and Muhammedan culture thus become  identical.    I use the term hypotheses, for the reason that the final determination  of the points at issue was by no means identical, wherever the Qoran  definitely contradicted Christian views of morality or social laws.  But in these cases also, Christian ideas were able to impose  themselves upon tradition and to issue in practice, even when opposed  by the actual text of the Qoran. They did not always pass unquestioned  and even on trivial points were obliged to encounter some resistance.  The theory of the Sunday was accepted, but that day was not chosen and  Friday was preferred: meetings for worship were held in imitation of  Christian practice, but attempts to sanctify the day and to proclaim  it a day of rest were forbidden: except for the performance of divine  service, Friday was an ordinary week-day. When, however, the Qoran was  in any sort of harmony with Christianity, the Christian ideas of the  age were textually accepted in any further development of the  question. The fact is obvious, not only as regards details, but also  in the general theory of man's position upon earth.           *       *       *       *       *    Muhammed, the preacher of repentance, had become a temporal prince in  Medina; his civil and political administration was ecclesiastical in  character, an inevitable result of his position as the apostle of God,  whose congregation was at the same time a state. This theory of the  state led later theorists unconsciously to follow the lead of  Christianity, which regarded the church as supreme in every department  of life, and so induced Muhammedanism to adopt views of life and  social order which are now styled mediaeval. The theological  development of this system is to be attributed chiefly to groups of  pious thinkers in Medina: they were excluded from political life when  the capital was transferred from Medina to Damascus and were left in  peace to elaborate their theory of the Muhammedan divine polity. The  influence of these groups was paramount: but of almost equal  importance was the influence of the proselytes in the conquered lands  who were Christians for the most part and for that reason far above  their Arab contemporaries in respect of intellectual training and  culture. We find that the details of jurisprudence, dogma, and  mysticism can only be explained by reference to Christian stimulus,  nor is it any exaggeration to ascribe the further development of  Muhammed's views to the influence of thinkers who regarded the  religious polity of Islam as the realisation of an ideal which  Christianity had hitherto vainly striven to attain. This ideal was the  supremacy of religion over life and all its activities, over the state  and the individual alike. But it was a religion primarily concerned  with the next world, where alone real worth was to be found. Earthly  life was a pilgrimage to be performed and earthly intentions had no  place with heavenly. The joy of life which the ancient world had  known, art, music and culture, all were rejected or valued only as  aids to religion. Human action was judged with reference only to its  appraisement in the life to come. That ascetic spirit was paramount,  which had enchained the Christian world, that renunciation of secular  affairs which explains the peculiar methods by which mediaeval views  of life found expression.    Asceticism did not disturb the course of life as a whole. It might  condemn but it could not suppress the natural impulse of man to  propagate his race: it might hamper economic forces, but it could not  destroy them. It eventually led to a compromise in every department of  life, but for centuries it retained its domination over men's minds  and to some material extent over their actions.    Such was the environment in which Islam was planted: its deepest roots  had been fertilised with Christian theory, and in spite of Muhammed's  call to repentance, its most characteristic manifestations were  somewhat worldly and non-ascetic. \"Islam knows not monasticism\" says  the tradition which this tendency produced. The most important  compromise of all, that with life, which Christianity only secured by  gradual steps, had been already attained for Islam by Muhammed himself  and was included in the course of his development. As Islam now  entered the Christian world, it was forced to pass through this  process of development once more. At the outset it was permeated with  the idea of Christian asceticism, to which an inevitable opposition  arose, and found expression in such statements as that already quoted.  But Muhammed's preaching had obviously striven to honour the future  life by painting the actual world in the gloomiest colours, and the  material optimism of the secular-minded was unable to check the  advance of Christian asceticism among the classes which felt a real  interest in religion. Hence that surprising similarity of views upon  the problem of existence, which we have now to outline. In details of  outward form great divergency is apparent. Christianity possessed a  clergy while Islam did not: yet the force of Christian influence  produced a priestly class in Islam. It was a class acting not as  mediator between God and man through sacraments and mysteries, but as  moral leaders and legal experts; as such it was no less important than  the scribes under Judaism. Unanimity among these scholars could  produce decisions no less binding than those of the Christian clergy  assembled in church councils. They are representatives of the  congregation which \"has no unanimity, for such would be an error.\"  Islam naturally preferred to adopt unanimous conclusions in silence  rather than to vote in assemblies. As a matter of fact a body of  orthodox opinion was developed by this means with no less success than  in Christendom. Any agreement which the quiet work of the scholars had  secured upon any question was ratified by God and was thus irrevocably  and eternally binding. For instance, the proclamation to the faithful  of new ideas upon the exposition of the Qoran or of tradition was  absolutely forbidden; the scholars, in other words the clergy, had  convinced themselves, by the fact of their unanimity upon the point,  that the customary and traditional mode of exposition was the one  pleasing to God. Ideas of this kind naturally remind us of Roman  Catholic practice. The influence of Eastern Christianity upon Islam is  undoubtedly visible here. This influence could not in the face of  Muhammedan tradition and custom, create an"]]]
