The ill success with which these attempts were attended might have been  expected to deter others from risking the certain punishment which  followed their being detected; but, as some were known to have eluded the  strictest search, every one who could find a friend among the seamen to  conceal him, hoped that he might prove the fortunate one who should  escape. Although they every day saw that no obstacle was thrown in the  way of the convict who had got through the period of his transportation  with credit and a good character, but that he was suffered to depart with  the master of any ship who would receive him, and a certificate given to  him of his being a free man; yet, thoughtless, and dissatisfied with  their present situation, be it what it might, they preferred encountering  the hazard of being discovered and punished, or, even if they reached  another country, the discredit with which they must appear, if it should  be known that they were convicts from 'Botany Bay,' to waiting with  patience until they could be dismissed from the colony with the  reputation of having deserved the state of freedom at which they had  arrived.     On the 16th of the month, a general muster of all descriptions of  persons took place over every part of the colony at the same hour; for  it had been found, that in mustering one district at a time, a deception  had been successfully practised by some, of running from one place to  another, and answering to their names at each, thereby drawing  provisions from both stores, having previously imposed themselves on the  store-keepers as belonging to their district. This could not, indeed,  have long continued, if the store-keepers had been properly attentive to  the directions which they received; but it was almost impossible to  guard against the artful and well-contrived deceptions which these  people were constantly playing off, to impose upon propriety,  regulation, and good order.    It being at this time much wished to get four or five hundred acres of  the ground belonging to government in a state to be sown the next season  with wheat, the governor went up to Parramatta, to settle some necessary  concerns there, and to endeavour, if possible, to get strength sufficient  for that purpose. While here, he had the satisfaction of knowing that the  stock of large cattle belonging to government were in excellent  condition, having been sent to Toongabbie, where they had met with better  food and more care than elsewhere. The preservation of these animals was  an object of the greatest importance, as, independent of the large sums  of money with which they had been purchased, their utility as a stock  both for present labour, and future consumption, was incalculable.    Several of the settlers having last year had occasion, from the failure  of the preceding crop, to borrow seed for sowing their ground again with  wheat, an order was issued on the 21st, reminding those settlers who had  received this assistance from government, that it was expected they  would, out of their first crops, pay this debt, and take up the receipts  which they had given. That if any evasion should be attempted, or any  delay made in the payment, such steps as the law pointed out would be  taken against them, and the defaulters marked as undeserving of the aid  of government on any future occasion; and, what was calculated to meet a  trick which some of them had played, they were finally informed, that if  any among them, in contemplation of getting rid of the debt, had sold  their farms since receiving the grain from government, the land would  still be considered as the debtor, and the purchaser responsible for the  payment.    The savage inhabitants of the country, instead of losing any part of  their native ferocity of manners by an intercourse with the Europeans  among whom they dwelt, seemed rather to delight in exhibiting themselves  as monsters of the greatest cruelty, devoid of reason, and guided solely  by the impulse of the worst passions.    Toward the latter end of the month, the governor received information,  that a little native girl, between six and seven years of age, who for  some time had lived at the governor's house, had been most inhumanly  murdered by two of her savage countrymen. The father and mother of this  child belonged to a party of natives who had committed so many  depredations upon the settlers at the Hawkesbury, attended with such acts  of cruelty as to render them extremely formidable: insomuch that it  became necessary to send an armed party in pursuit of them. They were  soon found, and, being fired upon, the father and mother of this little  female were among those who fell. She was with them at the time, and  readily accompanied our people to the settlement, where she was received;  and, being a well disposed child, soon became a great favourite with her  protectors. This, and her being a native of the country near Broken Bay,  excited the jealousy of some of the natives who lived at and about  Sydney, which manifested itself in their putting her to death in the most  cruel manner. The body was found in the woods near the governor's house,  speared in several places, and with both the arms cut off; whence it was  brought in and buried.    No other conjecture could be formed of this atrocious act than what has  been already mentioned. As she belonged to a tribe of natives that was  hostile to the Sydney people, they could not admit of her partaking in  those pleasures and comforts which they derived from their residence  among the colonists, and therefore inhumanly put her out of the way. The  governor was very much incensed at this proceeding; and, could he have  found the offenders, would have most severely punished them; but they had  immediately withdrawn into the woods.    Among the public works in hand during this month must be mentioned, the  laying of the last stone of the wind-mill tower at Sydney on the 21st; and  on the following day the workmen began to get up the wood work of the top.    On the 24th there was a general issue of clothing, and the 26th was  observed as Christmas Day.    The weather in the first and middle parts of the month had been very bad,  heavy rains (which much retarded the getting in of the harvest)  prevailing, with thunder and lightning, and winds strong at east. The  latter part being moderate, the Colonial schooner took the opportunity to  go round to the Hawkesbury for a cargo of wheat.

The ground hereabout was carefully examined, to see if  it would admit such a number of settlers as might be sufficient for the  purpose of mutual protection; but it was found inadequate to that end,  the limits of it on the banks of the river, where the soil was excellent,  being much too narrow.    On the first of the month the governor had reached the principal  settlement, having occasionally landed to examine into the state of the  different farms, as well as to settle disputes relative to property, and  differences between the settlers and their hired servants.    Having had previous notice, a general muster of these people now took  place; which being compared with one taken some time since, many  impositions were detected and rectified. After the muster, they were  reminded that several of them were considerably indebted to government  for the seed from which their present abundant crops had been produced,  and directed forthwith to return into the store a quantity equal to that  which they had borrowed for the purpose. This it was absolutely necessary  to point out and insist upon, as there were but few among them who would  have been found with principle enough to have returned it of themselves.    While they were here, the governor and his party went up the river, and  ascended Richmond-hill, on the summit of which a large smoke was made at  noon, at which time a similar smoke was made on Prospect-hill, that was  very distinctly seen, and its bearings taken, to ascertain the relative  situation of the two hills. This bearing, which was S 35 degrees 00  minutes E by compass, gave, with the latitude observed on each, the  distance between the two hills about eighteen miles in a direct line.    By this bearing, should there be occasion hereafter, a road through the  woods, from the head of the Hawkesbury, might be cut in the shortest and  most direct way to Parramatta.    At the head of this river, and upon the banks of that named the Nepean,  there was known to be a tract of excellent land, as rich as any on the  banks of the Hawkesbury which was then under cultivation, and where, at  some future period, a settlement might be advantageously established.

Towards midnight the  stars shone out, and if the engineer had been there with his companions  he would have remarked that these stars did not belong to the Northern  Hemisphere. The Polar Star was not visible, the constellations were not  those which they had been accustomed to see in the United States; the  Southern Cross glittered brightly in the sky.    The night passed away. Towards five o'clock in the morning of the 25th  of March, the sky began to lighten; the horizon still remained dark,  but with daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea, so that the eye could  scarcely penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood. At  length the fog gradually unrolled itself in great heavily moving waves.    It was unfortunate, however, that the castaways could distinguish  nothing around them. While the gaze of the reporter and Neb were cast  upon the ocean, the sailor and Herbert looked eagerly for the coast  in the west. But not a speck of land was visible. \"Never mind,\" said  Pencroft, \"though I do not see the land, I feel it... it is there...  there... as sure as the fact that we are no longer at Richmond.\" But the  fog was not long in rising. It was only a fine-weather mist. A hot  sun soon penetrated to the surface of the island. About half-past  six, three-quarters of an hour after sunrise, the mist became more  transparent. It grew thicker above, but cleared away below. Soon the  isle appeared as if it had descended from a cloud, then the sea showed  itself around them, spreading far away towards the east, but bounded on  the west by an abrupt and precipitous coast.    Yes! the land was there. Their safety was at least provisionally  insured. The islet and the coast were separated by a channel about half  a mile in breadth, through which rushed an extremely rapid current.    However, one of the castaways, following the impulse of his heart,  immediately threw himself into the current, without consulting his  companions, without saying a single word. It was Neb. He was in haste  to be on the other side, and to climb towards the north. It had been  impossible to hold him back. Pencroft called him in vain. The reporter  prepared to follow him, but Pencroft stopped him. \"Do you want to cross  the channel?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" replied Spilett. \"All right!\" said the  seaman; \"wait a bit; Neb is well able to carry help to his master. If we  venture into the channel, we risk being carried into the open sea by  the current, which is running very strong; but, if I'm not wrong, it is  ebbing. See, the tide is going down over the sand. Let us have patience,  and at low water it is possible we may find a fordable passage.\" \"You  are right,\" replied the reporter, \"we will not separate more than we can  help.\"    During this time Neb was struggling vigorously against the current. He  was crossing in an oblique direction. His black shoulders could be seen  emerging at each stroke. He was carried down very quickly, but he also  made way towards the shore. It took more than half an hour to cross from  the islet to the land, and he reached the shore several hundred feet  from the place which was opposite to the point from which he had  started.    Landing at the foot of a high wall of granite, he shook himself  vigorously; and then, setting off running, soon disappeared behind  a rocky point, which projected to nearly the height of the northern  extremity of the islet.    Neb's companions had watched his daring attempt with painful anxiety,  and when he was out of sight, they fixed their attention on the land  where their hope of safety lay, while eating some shell-fish with which  the sand was strewn. It was a wretched repast, but still it was better  than nothing. The opposite coast formed one vast bay, terminating on the  south by a very sharp point, which was destitute of all vegetation,  and was of a very wild aspect. This point abutted on the shore in a  grotesque outline of high granite rocks. Towards the north, on the  contrary, the bay widened, and a more rounded coast appeared, trending  from the southwest to the northeast, and terminating in a slender cape.  The distance between these two extremities, which made the bow of the  bay, was about eight miles. Half a mile from the shore rose the islet,  which somewhat resembled the carcass of a gigantic whale. Its extreme  breadth was not more than a quarter of a mile.    Opposite the islet, the beach consisted first of sand, covered with  black stones, which were now appearing little by little above the  retreating tide. The second level was separated by a perpendicular  granite cliff, terminated at the top by an unequal edge at a height of  at least 300 feet. It continued thus for a length of three miles, ending  suddenly on the right with a precipice which looked as if cut by the  hand of man. On the left, above the promontory, this irregular and  jagged cliff descended by a long slope of conglomerated rocks till it  mingled with the ground of the southern point. On the upper plateau of  the coast not a tree appeared. It was a flat tableland like that above  Cape Town at the Cape of Good Hope, but of reduced proportions; at least  so it appeared seen from the islet. However, verdure was not wanting to  the right beyond the precipice. They could easily distinguish a confused  mass of great trees, which extended beyond the limits of their view.  This verdure relieved the eye, so long wearied by the continued ranges  of granite. Lastly, beyond and above the plateau, in a northwesterly  direction and at a distance of at least seven miles, glittered a white  summit which reflected the sun's rays. It was that of a lofty mountain,  capped with snow.    The question could not at present be decided whether this land formed  an island, or whether it belonged to a continent. But on beholding  the convulsed masses heaped up on the left, no geologist would have  hesitated to give them a volcanic origin, for they were unquestionably  the work of subterranean convulsions.    Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert attentively examined this land, on  which they might perhaps have to live many long years; on which indeed  they might even die, should it be out of the usual track of vessels, as  was likely to be the case.    \"Well,\" asked Herbert, \"what do you say, Pencroft?\"    \"There is some good and some bad, as in everything,\" replied the sailor.  \"We shall see. But now the ebb is evidently making. In three hours we  will attempt the passage, and once on the other side, we will try to get  out of this scrape, and I hope may find the captain.\" Pencroft was not  wrong in his anticipations. Three hours later at low tide, the greater  part of the sand forming the bed of the channel was uncovered. Between  the islet and the coast there only remained a narrow channel which would  no doubt be easy to cross.    About ten o'clock, Gideon Spilett and his companions stripped themselves  of their clothes, which they placed in bundles on their heads, and  then ventured into the water, which was not more than five feet deep.  Herbert, for whom it was too deep, swam like a fish, and got through  capitally. All three arrived without difficulty on the opposite shore.  Quickly drying themselves in the sun, they put on their clothes, which  they had preserved from contact with the water, and sat down to take  counsel together what to do next.        Chapter 4    All at once the reporter sprang up, and telling the sailor that he would  rejoin them at that same place, he climbed the cliff in the direction  which the Negro Neb had taken a few hours before. Anxiety hastened  his steps, for he longed to obtain news of his friend, and he soon  disappeared round an angle of the cliff. Herbert wished to accompany  him.    \"Stop here, my boy,\" said the sailor; \"we have to prepare an encampment,  and to try and find rather better grub than these shell-fish. Our  friends will want something when they come back. There is work for  everybody.\"    \"I am ready,\" replied Herbert.    \"All right,\" said the sailor; \"that will do. We must set about it  regularly. We are tired, cold, and hungry; therefore we must have  shelter, fire, and food. There is wood in the forest, and eggs in nests;  we have only to find a house.\"    \"Very well,\" returned Herbert, \"I will look for a cave among the rocks,  and I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can creep.\"    \"All right,\" said Pencroft; \"go on, my boy.\"    They both walked to the foot of the enormous wall over the beach, far  from which the tide had now retreated; but instead of going towards the  north, they went southward. Pencroft had remarked, several hundred feet  from the place at which they landed, a narrow cutting, out of which  he thought a river or stream might issue. Now, on the one hand it was  important to settle themselves in the neighborhood of a good stream  of water, and on the other it was possible that the current had thrown  Cyrus Harding on the shore there.    The cliff, as has been said, rose to a height of three hundred feet, but  the mass was unbroken throughout, and even at its base, scarcely washed  by the sea, it did not offer the smallest fissure which would serve as  a dwelling. It was a perpendicular wall of very hard granite, which even  the waves had not worn away. Towards the summit fluttered myriads of  sea-fowl, and especially those of the web-footed species with long,  flat, pointed beaks--a clamorous tribe, bold in the presence of man,  who probably for the first time thus invaded their domains. Pencroft  recognized the skua and other gulls among them, the voracious little  sea-mew, which in great numbers nestled in the crevices of the granite.  A shot fired among this swarm would have killed a great number, but to  fire a shot a gun was needed, and neither Pencroft nor Herbert had one;  besides this, gulls and sea-mews are scarcely eatable, and even their"]]]
