See! look at yourself in the glass. Your face betrays you.  It is red with shame.\"    \"Then is my color a liar, uncle; but I am not,\" Napoleon insisted.    \"What were you doing here, all alone?\" asked his uncle.    \"I was thirsty,\" replied the nephew. \"I did but come for a drink of  water.\"    \"That perhaps is so,\" said Uncle Lucien. \"There is no harm in that. You  came for a drink of water; but, how was it after that,--eh, my friend?\"    \"That is all, uncle,\" replied Napoleon.    \"And the water? Have you taken a drink of it, yet?\"    \"No, uncle; not yet.\"    The canon again shook his head doubtingly.    \"See, then,\" he declared, \"you came for a drink of water. You took no  drink; the sideboard stands open; my fruit has disappeared. Napoleon,  this is not right. You have done a wrong. Come, tell me the truth. If it  is not as you say, if you have lied to me, much as I love you, I will  have you punished. It is wicked in you, and I will not be merciful.\"    As the canon said this with raised voice and warning finger,  Napoleon's father, \"Papa Charles,\" entered the room. With him  came Napoleon's brother Joseph, two years older than he, and his  twelve-year-old uncle-Joey Fesch. Joey was Mamma Letitia's half-brother,  a Swiss-Corsican boy. He was, as I have told you, Napoleon's firm  supporter.    They looked in surprise at Uncle Lucien and Napoleon, and would have  inquired as to the meaning of the attitude of the two. But the fact was,  Napoleon had so many such moments of rebellion, that they gave it  no immediate thought; and just then Charles Bonaparte had a serious  political question which he wished to refer to the Canon Lucien.    The two men at once began talking; the two boys saw through the open  window something that engaged their attention, and Napoleon was  unnoticed. But still the little boy stood, too proud to move away, too  angry to speak, and so filled with a sense of the injustice that was  done him, that he remained with downcast eyes, almost rooted to the  spot, while still the sideboard stood open, and the tell-tale basket  stood despoiled within it. The door opened again, and Saveria entered  hastily. She went to the sideboard, took out the basket of fruit,  and then you may be sure there was an exclamation that attracted the  attention of all in the room.    \"For mercy's sake!\" she cried. \"Who has taken the canon's fruit?\"    \"Ah, yes, who?\" echoed Uncle Lucien, wheeling about, and laying his hand  upon Napoleon's shoulder. \"Behold, Saveria! here is the culprit. He has  taken my fruit.\"    Napoleon pushed away his uncle's hand.    \"It is not so!\" he said; but he grew pale as he spoke. \"I have not  touched it.\"    \"But some one has. Hear me, Saveria!\" the canon commanded; for in that  house he had quite as much to say as the Father and Mother Bonaparte.  \"Call in the other children. We will soon settle this.\"    All were soon in the room,--the two little girls, Joseph, and Uncle Joey  Fesch, even baby Lucien, who was named for his uncle the canon. The  children made a charming group; but they looked at Napoleon with  curiosity and surprise, wondering into what new trouble he had fallen.  For the solemn manner in which they had been called together, the grave  looks of Papa Charles, of Uncle Lucien, and of Nurse Saveria, led  them all to believe that something really serious had happened in the  Bonaparte household.          CHAPTER THREE.    THE ACCUSATION.    \"Now, then, children, listen to me, and answer, he who is the guilty  one,\" Charles Bonaparte said, facing the group of children. \"Who is it  that has taken the fruit from the basket of your uncle the canon?\"    Each child declared his or her innocence, though one might imagine that  Eliza's voice was not so outspoken as the others.    \"And what do you say, Napoleon?\" asked Papa Charles, turning toward the  suspected one.    \"I have already said, Papa Charles, that it was not I,\" Napoleon  answered, this time calmly and coolly; for his composure had returned.    \"That is a lie, Napoleon!\" exclaimed Nurse Saveria, who, as the trusted  servant of the Bonaparte family, spoke just as she wished, and said  precisely what she meant, while no one questioned her freedom. \"That is  a lie, Napoleon, and you know it!\" The boy sprang toward the nurse in a  rage, and, lifting his hand threateningly, cried, \"Saveria! if you were  not a woman, I would\"--and he simply shook his little fist at her, too  angry even to complete his threat.    \"How now, Napoleon! what would you do?\" his father exclaimed.    But Saveria only laughed scornfully. \"It must have been you, Napoleon,\"  she said. \"I have not left the pantry since I placed the basket of fruit  in this sideboard. No one has come in through the door except you and  your uncle the canon. Who else, then, could have taken the fruit? You  will not say\"--and here she laughed again--\"that it is your uncle the  canon who has stolen his own fruit?\"    \"Ah, but I wish it had been I,\" said Uncle Lucien, smiling sadly; for  it sorely disturbed his good-nature to have such a scene, and to be  a witness of what he believed to be Napoleon's obstinacy and  untruthfulness. \"I would surely say so, even if I had to go without my  supper for the disobedient act.\"    \"But,\" suggested Napoleon, in a broken voice, touched with the shame of  appearing to be a tell-tale, \"it is possible for some one to come in  here through the window.\"    \"Bah!\" cried Saveria. \"Do not be a silly too. No one has come through  the window. You are the thief, Napoleon. You have taken the fruit. Come,  I will punish you doubly--first for thieving, and then for lying.\"    But as she crossed as if to seize the boy, Napoleon sprang toward his  uncle for refuge.    \"Uncle Lucien! I did not do it!\" he cried. \"They must not punish me!\"    \"Tell the truth, Napoleon,\" his father said. \"That is better than  lying.\"    \"Yes, tell the truth, Napoleon,\" repeated his uncle; \"only by confession  can you escape punishment.\"    \"Ah, yes; punishment--how does that sound, Napoleon?\" whispered Joseph  in his ear. \"You had better tell the truth. Saveria's whip hurts.\"    \"And so does my hand, rascal!\" cried Napoleon, enraged at the taunts of  his brother. And he sprang upon Joseph, and beat and bit him so sharply  that the elder boy howled for help, and Uncle Joey Fesch was obliged  to pull the brothers apart. For Joseph and Napoleon were forever  quarrelling; and Uncle Joey Fesch was kept busy separating them, or  smoothing over their squabbles.    As Uncle Joey Fesch drew Napoleon away, he said, \"Tell them you took the  fruit, and they will pardon you. Is it not so, Uncle Lucien?\" he added,  turning to the canon.    \"Assuredly, Joey Fesch,\" the Canon Lucien replied. \"Sin confessed is  half forgiven.\"    But Napoleon only stamped his foot. \"Why should I confess?\" he cried.  \"What should I confess? I should lie if I did so. I will not lie! I tell  you I did not take any of my uncle's fruit!\"    \"Confess,\" urged Joseph.    \"'Fess,\" lisped baby Lucien.    \"Confess, dear Napoleon,\" sister Pauline begged.    Only Eliza remained quiet.    \"Napoleon,\" said the Canon Lucien, who, as head of the Bonaparte  family, and who, especially because he was its main support, was given  leadership in all home affairs, \"we waste time with you; for you are but  an obstinate boy. At first I felt sorry for you, and would have excused  you, but now I can do so no longer. See, now; I give you five minutes  by my watch in which to confess your wrong-doing. You ask for my  protection. I am certain of your guilt. But I open a door of escape.  It is the door to pardon; it is confession. Profit by it. See,  again,\"--here the canon took out his watch,--\"it is now five minutes  before seven. If, when the clock strikes seven, you have not confessed,  Saveria shall give you a whipping. Am I right, brother Charles?\"    \"You are right, Canon,\" replied Papa Charles. \"If within five minutes by  your watch Napoleon has not confessed, Saveria shall give him the whip.\"    \"The whip is for horses and dogs, but not for boys,\" Napoleon declared,  upon whom this threat of the whip always had an extraordinary effect. \"I  am not a beast.\"    \"The whip is for liars, Napoleon,\" returned Papa Charles; \"for liars and  children who disobey.\"    \"Then, you are cruel to lay it over me; you are cruel and unjust,\"  declared the boy. \"For I am not a liar; I am not disobedient. I will not  be whipped!\"    As he spoke, the boy's eyes flashed defiance. He crossed his arms on his  breast, lifted his head proudly, planted himself sturdily on his feet,  and flung at them all a look of mingled indignation and determination.    Supper was ready; and the family, all save Napoleon, seated themselves  at the table. The five minutes granted him by the canon had run into a  longer time, when little Pauline, distressed at sight of her brother  standing pale and grave in front of the open sideboard and the despoiled  basket of fruit, rose from her chair; approaching him, she whispered,  \"Poor boy! they will give you the whip. I am sure of it. Hear me! While  they are not looking, run away. See! the window is open.\"    \"Run away? Not I!\" came Napoleon's answer in an indignant whisper. \"I am  not afraid.\"    \"But I am,\" said Pauline. \"I do not wish them to whip you. I shall cry.  Run, Napoleon! run away!\"    The perspiration stood in beads on the boy's sallow forehead; but he  said nothing. \"Ask Uncle Lucien's pardon, Napoleon; ask Papa Charles's  pardon, if you will not run away,\" Pauline next whispered; \"or let me.  Come! may I not do it for you?\"    Napoleon's hand dropped upon Pauline's shoulder, as if to keep her back  from such an action; but he said nothing.    \"Pauline, leave your brother,\" Charles Bonaparte said. \"He is a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/949"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat; Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (#4)"],[1,"  submarine boat builders who are going to try for the prize, and I want  to arrange a date that will be satisfactory to all. I am greatly  astonished that you are not going to compete.\"    \"Well, we were going to,\" said Mr. Swift, \"only we have changed our  minds, that's all. My son and I have other plans.\"    \"May I ask what they are?\" questioned Mr. Berg.    \"You may,\" exclaimed Tom quickly; \"but I don't believe we can tell you.  They're a secret,\" he added more cordially.    \"Oh, I see,\" retorted Mr. Berg. \"Well, of course I don't wish to  penetrate any of your secrets, but I hoped we could contest together  for the Government prize. It is worth trying for I assure you--fifty  thousand dollars. Besides, there is the possibility of selling a number  of submarines to the United States. It's a fine prize.\"    \"But the one we are after is a bigger one,\" cried Tom impetuously, and  the moment he had spoken he wished he could recall the words.    \"Eh? What's that?\" exclaimed Mr. Berg. \"You don't mean to say another  government has offered a larger prize? If I had known that I would not  have let my firm enter into the competition for the bonus offered by  the United States.  Please tell me.\"    \"I'm sorry,\" went on Tom more soberly. \"I shouldn't have spoken. Mr.  Berg, the plans of my father and myself are such that we can't reveal  them now. We are going to try for a prize, but not in competition with  you. It's an entirely different matter.\"    \"Well, I guess you'll find that the firm of Bentley & Eagert are  capable of trying for any prizes that are offered,\" boasted the agent.  \"We may be competitors yet.\"    \"I don't believe so,\" replied Mr. Swift.    \"We may,\" repeated Mr. Berg. \"And if we do, please remember that we  will show no mercy. Our boats are the best.\"    \"And may the best boat win,\" interjected Mr. Sharp.  \"That's all we  ask. A fair field and no favors.\"    \"Of course,\" spoke the agent coldly. \"Is this another son of yours?\" he  asked.    \"No but a good friend,\" replied the aged inventor. \"No, Mr. Berg, we  won't compete this time. You may tell your firm so.\"    \"Very good,\" was the other's stiff reply. \"Then I will bid you good  night. We shall carry off the Government prize, but permit me to add  that I am very much astonished, very much indeed, that you do not try  for the prize. From what I have seen of your submarine you have a very  good one, almost as good, in some respects, as ours.  I bid you good  night,\" and with a bow the man left the room and hurried away from the  house.          Chapter Four    Tom is Imprisoned      \"Well, I must say he's a cool one,\" remarked Tom, as the echoes of Mr.  Berg's steps died away. \"The idea of thinking his boat better than  ours! I don't like that man, dad. I'm suspicious of him. Do you think  he came here to steal some of our ideas?\"    \"No, I hardly believe so, my son. But how did you discover him?\"    \"Just as you saw, dad. I heard a noise and went back there to  investigate. I found him sneaking around, looking at the electric  propeller plates. I went to grab him just as he stumbled over a board.  At first I thought it was one of the old gang. I'm almost sure he was  trying to discover something.\"    \"No, Tom. The firm he works for are good business men, and they would  not countenance anything like that. They are heartless competitors,  however, and if they saw a legitimate chance to get ahead of me and  take advantage, they would do it. But they would not sneak in to steal  my ideas. I feel sure of that. Besides, they have a certain type of  submarine which they think is the best ever invented, and they would  hardly change at this late day. They feel sure of winning the  Government prize, and I'm just as glad we're not going to have a  contest.\"    \"Do you think our boat is better than theirs?\"    \"Much better, in many respects.\"    \"I don't like that man Berg, though,\" went on Tom.    \"Nor do I,\" added his father. \"There is something strange about him.  He was very anxious that I should compete.  Probably he thought his  firm's boat would go so far ahead of ours that they would get an extra  bonus. But I'm glad he didn't see our new method of propulsion. That is  the principal improvement in the Advance over other types of  submarines. Well, another week and we will be ready for the test.\"    \"Have you known Mr. Berg long, dad?\"    \"Not very. I met him in Washington when I was in the patent office. He  was taking out papers on a submarine for his firm at the same time I  got mine for the Advance. It is rather curious that he should come all  the way here from Philadelphia, merely to see if I was going to  compete. There is something strange about it, something that I can't  understand.\"    The time was to come when Mr. Swift and his son were to get at the  bottom of Mr. Berg's reasons, and they learned to their sorrow that he  had penetrated some of their secrets.    Before going to bed that night Tom and Mr. Sharp paid a visit to the  shed where the submarine was resting on the ways, ready for launching.  They found Mr. Jackson on guard and the engineer said that no one had  been around. Nor was anything found disturbed.    \"It certainly is a great machine,\" remarked the lad as he looked up at  the cigar-shaped bulk towering over his head.  \"Dad has outdone himself  this trip.\"    \"It looks all right,\" commented Mr. Sharp. \"Whether it will work is  another question.\"    \"Yes, we can't tell until it's in the water,\" conceded Tom. \"But I  hope it does. Dad has spent much time and money on it.\"    The Advance was, as her name indicated, much in advance of previous  submarines. There was not so much difference in outward construction as  there was in the means of propulsion and in the manner in which the  interior and the machinery were arranged.    The submarine planned by Mr. Swift and Tom jointly, and constructed by  them, with the aid of Mr. Sharp and Mr. Jackson, was shaped like a  Cigar, over one hundred feet long and twenty feet in diameter at the  thickest part. It was divided into many compartments, all water-tight,  so that if one or even three were flooded the ship would still be  useable.    Buoyancy was provided for by having several tanks for the introduction  of compressed air, and there was an emergency arrangement so that a  collapsible aluminum container could be distended and filled with a  powerful gas. This was to be used if, by any means, the ship was  disabled on the bottom of the ocean. The container could be expanded  and filled, and would send the Advance to the surface.    Another peculiar feature was that the engine-room, dynamos and other  apparatus were all contained amidships. This gave stability to the  craft, and also enabled the same engine to operate both shafts and  propellers, as well as both the negative forward electrical plates, and  the positive rear ones.    These plates were a new idea in submarine construction, and were the  outcome of an idea of Mr. Swift, with some suggestions from his son.    The aged inventor did not want to depend on the usual screw propellers  for his craft, nor did he want to use a jet of compressed air, shooting  out from a rear tube, nor yet a jet of water, by means of which the  creature called the squid shoots himself along. Mr. Swift planned to  send the Advance along under water by means of electricity.    Certain peculiar plates were built at the forward and aft blunt noses  of the submarine. Into the forward plate a negative charge of  electricity was sent, and into the one at the rear a positive charge,  just as one end of a horseshoe magnet is positive and will repel the  north end of a compass needle, while the other pole of a magnet is  negative and will attract it. In electricity like repels like, while  negative and positive have a mutual attraction for each other.    Mr. Swift figured out that if he could send a powerful current of  negative electricity into the forward plate it would pull the boat  along, for water is a good conductor of electricity, while if a  positive charge was sent into the rear plate it would serve to push the  submarine along, and he would thus get a pulling and pushing motion,  just as a forward and aft propeller works on some ferry boats.    But the inventor did not depend on these plates alone.  There were  auxiliary forward and aft propellers of the regular type, so that if  the electrical plates did not work, or got out of order, the screws  would serve to send the Advance along.    There was much machinery in the submarine. There were gasolene motors,  since space was too cramped to allow the carrying of coal for boilers.  There were dynamos, motors and powerful pumps. Some of these were for  air, and some for water. To sink the submarine below the surface large  tanks were filled with water. To insure a more sudden descent,  deflecting rudders were also used, similar to those on an airship.  There were also special air pumps, and one for the powerful gas, which  was manufactured on board.    Forward from the engine-room was a cabin, where meals could be served,  and where the travelers could remain in the daytime. There was also a  small cooking galley, or kitchen, there. Back of the engine-room were  the sleeping quarters and the storerooms. The submarine was steered  from the forward compartment, and here were also levers, wheels and  valves that controlled all the machinery, while a number of dials  showed in which direction they were going, how deep they were, and at  what speed they were moving, as well as what the ocean pressure was.    On top, forward, was a small conning, or observation tower, with  auxiliary and steering and controlling apparatus there. This was to be  used when the ship was moving along on the surface of the ocean, or  merely with the deck awash.  There was a small flat deck surrounding  the conning tower and this was available when the craft was on the  surface.    There was provision made for leaving "]]]
