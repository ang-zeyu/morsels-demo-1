[FN [a] Caesar. lib. 4.]    The Britons were divided into many small nations or tribes; and being  a military people, whose sole property was their arms and their  cattle, it was impossible, after they had acquired a relish for  liberty, for their princes or chieftains to establish any despotic  authority over them.  Their governments, though monarchical [b], were  free, as well as those of all the Celtic nations; and the common  people seem even to have enjoyed more liberty among them [c] than  among the nations of Gaul [d], from which they were descended.  Each  state was divided into factions within itself [e]: it was agitated  with jealousy or animosity against the neighbouring states: and while  the arts of peace were yet unknown, wars were the chief occupation,  and formed the chief object of ambition among the people.  [FN [b] Diod. Sic. lib. 4.  Mela, lib. 3. cap. 6.  Strabo, lib. 4.  [c] Dion. Cassius, lib. 75  [d] Caesar. lib. 6.  [e] Tacit. Agr.]    The religion of the Britons was one of the most considerable parts of  their government; and the Druids, who were their priests, possessed  great authority among them.  Besides ministering at the altar, and  directing all religious duties, they presided over the education of  youth; they enjoyed an immunity from wars and taxes; they possessed  both the civil and criminal jurisdiction; they decided all  controversies among states as well as among private persons, and  whoever refused to submit to their decree was exposed to the most  severe penalties.  The sentence of excommunication was pronounced  against him: he was forbidden access to the sacrifices or public  worship: he was debarred all intercourse with his fellow-citizens,  even in the common affairs of life: his company was universally  shunned, as profane and dangerous.  He was refused the protection of  law [f]; and death itself became an acceptable relief from the misery  and infamy to which he was exposed.  Thus, the bands of government,  which were naturally loose among that rude and turbulent people, were  happily corroborated by the terrors of their superstition.  [FN [f] Caesar, lib. 6.  Strabo, lib. 4.]    No species of superstition was ever more terrible than that of the  Druids.  Besides the severe penalties, which it was in the power of  the ecclesiastics to inflict in this world, they inculcated the  eternal transmigration of souls; and thereby extended their authority  as far as the fears of their timorous votaries.  They practised their  rites in dark groves or other secret recesses [g]; and in order to  throw a greater mystery over their religion, they communicated their  doctrines only to the initiated, and strictly forbad the committing of  them to writing, lest they should at any time be exposed to the  examination of the profane vulgar.  Human sacrifices were practised  among them: the spoils of war were often devoted to their divinities;  and they punished with the severest tortures whoever dared to secrete  any part of the consecrated offering; these treasures they kept in  woods and forests, secured by no other guard than the terrors of their  religion [h]; and this steady conquest over human avidity may be  regarded as more signal than their prompting men to the most  extraordinary and most violent efforts.  No idolatrous worship ever  attained such an ascendant over mankind as that of the ancient Gauls  and Britons; and the Romans, after their conquest, finding it  impossible to reconcile those nations to the law and institutions of  their masters, while it maintained its authority, were at last obliged  to abolish it by penal statutes; a violence which had never, in any  other instance, been practised by those tolerating conquerors [i].  [FN [g] Plin. lib. 12. cap. 1.  [h] Caesar, lib. 6.  [i] Sueton. in  vita Claudii.]    [MN The Romans.]  The Britons had long remained in this rude but independent state, when  Caesar, having overrun all Gaul by his victories, first cast his eye  on their island.  He was not allured either by its riches or its  renown; but being ambitious of carrying the Roman arms into a new  world, then mostly unknown, he took advantage of a short interval in  his Gaulic wars, and made an invasion on Britain.  The natives,  informed of his intention, were sensible of the unequal contest, and  endeavoured to appease him by submissions, which, however, retarded  not the execution of his design.  After some resistance, he landed, as  is supposed, at Deal; [MN Anno Ante C. 55.] and having obtained  several advantages over the Britons, and obliged them to promise  hostages for their future obedience, he was constrained, by the  necessity of his affairs, and the approach of winter, to withdraw his  forces into Gaul.  The Britons, relieved from the terror of his arms,  neglected the performance of their stipulations; and that haughty  conqueror resolved next summer to chastise them for this breach of  treaty.  He landed with a greater force; and though he found a more  regular resistance from the Britons, who had united under  Cassivelaunus, one of their petty princes, he discomfited them in  every action.  He advanced into the country; passed the Thames in the  face of the enemy; took and burned the capital of Cassivelaunus;  established his ally, Mandubratius, in the sovereignty of the  Trinobantes; and having obliged the inhabitants to make him new  submissions, he again returned with his army into Gaul, and left the  authority of the Romans more nominal than real in this island.    The civil wars which ensued, and which prepared the way for the  establishment of monarchy in Rome, saved the Britons from that yoke  which was ready to be imposed upon them.  Augustus, the successor of  Caesar, content with the victory obtained over the liberties of his  own country, was little ambitious of acquiring fame by foreign wars;  and being apprehensive lest the same unlimited extent of dominion,  which had subverted the republic, might also overwhelm the empire, he  recommended it to his successors never to enlarge the territories of  the Romans.  Tiberius, jealous of the fame which might be acquired by  his generals, made this advice of Augustus a pretence for his  inactivity [k].  The mad sallies of Caligula, in which he menaced  Britain with an invasion, served only to expose himself and the empire  to ridicule: and the Britons had now, during almost a century, enjoyed  their liberty unmolested; when the Romans, in the reign of Claudius  began to think seriously of reducing them under their dominion.  Without seeking any more justifiable reasons of hostility than were  employed by the late Europeans in subjugating the Africans and  Americans, [MN A.D. 43.] they sent over an army under the command of  Plautius, an able general, who gained some victories, and made a  considerable progress in subduing the inhabitants.  Claudius himself,  finding matters sufficiently prepared for his reception, made a  journey into Britain, and received the submission of several British  states, the Cantii, Atrebates, Regni, and Trinobantes, who inhabited  the south-east part of the island, and whom their possessions and more  cultivated manner of life rendered willing to purchase peace at the  expense of their liberty.  The other Britons, under the command of  Caractacus, still maintained an obstinate resistance, and the Romans  made little progress against them, till Ostorius Scapula was sent over  to command their armies.  This general advanced the Roman conquests  over the Britons; [MN A.D. 50.] pierced into the country of the  Silures, a warlike nation who inhabited the banks of the Severn;  defeated Caractacus in a great battle; took him prisoner, and sent him  to Rome, where his magnanimous behaviour procured him better treatment  than those conquerors usually bestowed on captive princes [l].  [FN [k] Tacit. Agr.  [l] Tacit. Ann. lib. 12.]    Notwithstanding these misfortunes, the Britons were not subdued; and  this island was regarded by the ambitious Romans as a field in which  military honour might still be acquired.  [MN A.D. 59.]  Under the  reign of Nero, Suetonius Paulinus was invested with the command, and  prepared to signalize his name by victories over those barbarians.  Finding that the island of Mona, now Anglesey, was the chief seat of  the Druids, he resolved to attack it, and to subject a place which was  the centre of their superstition, and which afforded protection to all  their baffled forces.  The Britons endeavoured to obstruct his landing  on this sacred island, both by the force of their arms and the terrors  of their religion.  The women and priests were intermingled with the  soldiers upon the shore; and running about with flaming torches in  their hands, and tossing their dishevelled hair, they struck greater  terror into the astonished Romans by their howlings, cries, and  execrations, than the real danger from the armed forces was able to  inspire.  But Suetonius, exhorting his troops to despise the menaces  of a superstition which they despised, impelled them to the attack,  drove the Britons off the field, burned the Druids in the same fires  which those priests had prepared for their captive enemies, destroyed  all the consecrated groves and altars; and, having thus triumphed over  the religion of the Britons, he thought his future progress would be  easy in reducing the people to subjection.  But he was disappointed in  his expectations.  The Britons, taking advantage of his absence, were  all in arms; and headed by Boadicea, Queen of the Iceni, who had been  treated in the most ignominious manner by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10580"],[0,"The Positive School of Criminology (#5)"],[1,"e, that  you have decided to play a joke on a fellow-student, and that you carry  it out. He takes it unkindly. You are surprised, because that is  contrary to his habits and your expectations. But after a while you  learn that your friend had received bad news from home on the preceding  morning and was therefore not in a condition to feel like joking, and  then you say: \"If we had known that we should not have decided to spring  the joke on him.\" That is equivalent to saying that, if the balance of  your will had been inclined toward the deciding motive of no, you would  have decided no; but not knowing that your friend was distressed and not  in his habitual frame of mind, you decided in favor of yes. This  sentence: \"If I had known this I should not have done that\" is an outcry  of our internal consciousness, which denies the existence of a free  will.    On the other hand, nothing is created and nothing destroyed either in  matter or in force, because both matter and force are eternal and  indestructible. They transform themselves in the most diversified  manner, but not an atom is added or taken away, not one vibration more  or less takes place. And so if is the force of external and internal  circumstances which determines the decision of our will at any given  moment. The idea of a free will, however, is a denial of the law of  cause and effect, both in the field of philosophy and theology. Saint  Augustine and Martin Luther furnish irrefutable theological arguments  for the denial of a free will. The omnipotence of God is irreconcilable  with the idea of free will. If everything that happens does so because a  superhuman and omnipotent power wants it _(Not a single leaf falls to  the ground without the will of God)_, how can a son murder his father  without the permission and will of God? For this reason Saint Augustine  and Martin Luther have written _de servo arbitrio_.    But since theological arguments serve only those who believe in the  concept of a god, which is not given to us by science, we take recourse  to the laws which we observe in force and matter, and to the law of  causality. If modern science has discovered the universal link which  connects all phenomena through cause and effect, which shows that every  phenomenon is the result of causes which have preceded it; if this is  the law of causality, which is at the very bottom of modern scientific  thought, then it is evident that the admission of free thought is  equivalent to an overthrow of this law, according to which every effect  is proportionate to its cause. In that case, this law, which reigns  supreme in the entire universe, would dissolve itself into naught at  the feet of the human being, who would create effects with his free will  not corresponding to their causes! It was all right to think so at a  time when people had an entirely different idea of human beings. But the  work of modern science, and its effect on practical life, has resulted  in tracing the relations of each one of us with the world and with our  fellow beings. And the influence of science may be seen in the  elimination of great illusions which in former centuries swayed this or  that part of civilized humanity. The scientific thought of Copernicus  and Galilei did away with the illusions which led people to believe that  the earth was the center of the universe and of creation.    Take Cicero's book _de Officiis_, or the _Divina Commedia_ of Dante, and  you will find that to them the earth is the center of creation, that the  infinite stars circle around it, and that man is the king of animals: a  geocentric and anthropocentric illusion inspired by immeasurable  conceit. But Copernicus and Galilei came and demonstrated that the earth  does not stand still, but that it is a grain of cosmic matter hurled  into blue infinity and rotating since time unknown around its central  body, the sun, which originated from an immense primitive nebula.  Galilei was subjected to tortures by those who realized that this new  theory struck down many a religious legend and many a moral creed. But  Galilei had spoken the truth, and nowadays humanity no longer indulges  in the illusion that the earth is the center of creation.    But men live on illusions and give way but reluctantly to the progress  of science, in order to devote themselves arduously to the ideal of the  new truths which rise out of the essence of things of which mankind is a  part. After the geocentric illusion had been destroyed, the  anthropocentric illusion still remained. On earth, man was still  supposed to be king of creation, the center of terrestrial life. All  Species of animals, plants and minerals were supposed to be created  expressly for him, and to have had from time immemorial the forms which  we see now, so that the fauna and flora living on our planet have always  been what they are today. And Cicero, for instance, said that the  heavens were placed around the earth and man in order that he might  admire the beauty of the starry firmament at night, and that animals  and plants were created for his use and pleasure. But in 1856 Charles  Darwin came and, summarizing the results of studies that had been  carried on for a century, destroyed in the name of science the superb  illusion that man is the king and center of creation. He demonstrated,  amid the attacks and calumnies of the lovers of darkness, that man is  not the king of creation, but merely the last link of the zoological  chain, that nature is endowed with eternal energies by which animal and  plant life, the same as mineral life (for even in crystals the laws of  life are at work), are transformed from the invisible microbe to the  highest form, man.    The anthropocentric illusion rebelled against the word of Darwin,  accusing him of lowering the human life to the level of the dirt or of  the brute. But a disciple of Darwin gave the right answer, while  propagating the Darwinian theory at the university of Jena. It was  Haeckel, who concluded: \"For my part, and so far as my human  consciousness is concerned, I prefer to be an immensely perfected ape  rather than to be a degenerated and debased Adam.\"    Gradually the anthropocentric illusion has been compelled to give way  before the results of science, and today the theories of Darwin have  become established among our ideas. But another illusion still remains,  and science, working in the name of reality, will gradually eliminate  it, namely the illusion that the nineteenth century has established a  permanent order of society. While the geocentric and anthropocentric  illusions have been dispelled, the illusion of the immobility and  eternity of classes still persists. But it is well to remember that in  Holland in the sixteenth century, in England in the seventeenth, in  Europe since the revolution of 1789, we have seen that freedom of  thought in science, literature and art, for which the bourgeoisie  fought, triumphed over the tyranny of the mediaeval dogma. And this  condition, instead of being a glorious but transitory stage, is supposed  to be the end of the development of humanity, which is henceforth  condemned not to perfect itself any more by further changes. This is the  illusion which serves as a fundamental argument against the positive  school of criminology, since it is claimed that a penal justice  enthroned on the foundations of Beccaria and Carrara would be a  revolutionary heresy. It is also this illusion which serves as an  argument against those who draw the logical consequences in regard to  the socialistic future of humanity, for the science which takes its  departure front the work of Copernicus, Galilei and Darwin arrives  logically at socialism. Socialism is but the natural and physical  transformation of the economic and social institutions. Of course, so  long as the geocentric and anthropocentric illusions dominate, it is  natural that the lore of stability should impress itself upon science  and life. How could this living atom, which the human being is,  undertake to change that order of creation, which makes of the earth the  center of the universe and of man the center of life? Not until science  had introduced the conception of a natural formation and transformation,  of the solar system, as well as of the fauna and flora, did the human  mind grasp the idea that thought and action can transform the world.    For this reason we believe that the study of the criminal, and the  logical consequences therefrom, will bring about the complete  transformation of human justice, not only as a theory laid down in  scientific books, but also as a practical function applied every day to  that living and suffering portion of humanity which has fallen into  crime. We have the undaunted faith that the work of scientific truth  will transform penal justice into a simple function of preserving  society from the disease of crime, divested of all relics of vengeance,  hatred and punishment, which still survive in our day as living  reminders of the barbarian stage. We still hear the \"public vengeance\"  invoked against the criminal today, and justice has still for its symbol  a sword, which it uses more than the scales. But a judge born of a woman  cannot weigh the moral responsibility of one who has committed murder or  theft. Not until the experimental and scientific method shall look for  the causes of that dangerous malady, which we call crime, in the  physical and psychic organism, and in the family and the environment, of  the criminal, will justice guided by science discard the sword which now  descends bloody upon those poor fellow-beings who have fallen victims to  crime, and become a clinical function, whose prime object shall be to  remove or lessen in society and individuals the causes which incite to  crime. Then alone will justice refrain from wreaking vengeance, after a  crime has been committed, with the shame of an execution or the  absurdity of"]]]
