Orpheus was a lawgiver by theocratic commission. He understood nature,  and made her forms move to his music. He told her secrets in the form  of hymns, Nature as seen in the mind of God. His soul went forth  toward all beings, yet could remain sternly faithful to a chosen type  of excellence. Seeking what he loved, he feared not death nor hell;  neither could any shape of dread daunt his faith in the power of the  celestial harmony that filled his soul.    It seemed significant of the state of things in this country, that the  sculptor should have represented the seer at the moment when he was  obliged with his hand to shade his eyes.      Each Orpheus must to the depths descend;      For only thus the Poet can be wise;    Must make the sad Persephone his friend,      And buried love to second life arise;    Again his love must lose through too much love,      Must lose his life by living life too true,    For what he sought below is passed above,      Already done is all that he would do    Must tune all being with his single lyre,      Must melt all rooks free from their primal pain,    Must search all nature with his one soul's fire,      Must bind anew all forms in heavenly chain.    If he already sees what he must do,      Well may he shade his eyes from the far-shining view.      A better comment could not be made on what is required to perfect Man,  and place him in that superior position for which he was designed,  than by the interpretation of Bacon upon the legends of the Syren  coast \"When the wise Ulysses passed,\" says he, \"he caused his mariners  to stop their ears, with wax, knowing there was in them no power to  resist the lure of that voluptuous song. But he, the much experienced  man, who wished to be experienced in all, and use all to the service  of wisdom, desired to hear the song that he might understand its  meaning. Yet, distrusting his own power to be firm in his better  purpose, he caused himself to be bound to the mast, that he might be  kept secure against his own weakness. But Orpheus passed unfettered,  so absorbed in singing hymns to the gods that he could not even hear  those sounds of degrading enchantment.\"    Meanwhile, not a few believe, and men themselves have expressed the  opinion, that the time is come when Eurydice is to call for an  Orpheus, rather than Orpheus for Eurydice; that the idea of Man,  however imperfectly brought out, has been far more so than that of  Woman; that she, the other half of the same thought, the other chamber  of the heart of life, needs now take her turn in the full pulsation,  and that improvement in the daughters will best aid in the reformation  of the sons of this age.    It should be remarked that, as the principle of liberty is better  understood, and more nobly interpreted, a broader protest is made in  behalf of Woman. As men become aware that few men have had a fair  chance, they are inclined to say that no women have had a fair chance.  The French Revolution, that strangely disguised angel, bore witness in  favor of Woman, but interpreted her claims no less ignorantly than  those of Man. Its idea of happiness did not rise beyond outward  enjoyment, unobstructed by the tyranny of others. The title it gave  was \"citoyen,\" \"citoyenne;\" and it is not unimportant to Woman that  even this species of equality was awarded her. Before, she could be  condemned to perish on the scaffold for treason, not as a citizen, but  as a subject. The right with which this title then invested a human  being was that of bloodshed and license. The Goddess of Liberty was  impure. As we read the poem addressed to her, not long since, by  Beranger, we can scarcely refrain from tears as painful as the tears  of blood that flowed when \"such crimes were committed in her name.\"  Yes! Man, born to purify and animate the unintelligent and the cold,  can, in his madness, degrade and pollute no less the fair and the  chaste. Yet truth was prophesied in the ravings of that hideous fever,  caused by long ignorance and abuse. Europe is conning a valued lesson  from the blood-stained page. The same tendencies, further unfolded,  will bear good fruit in this country.    Yet, by men in this country, as by the Jews, when Moses was leading  them to the promised land, everything has been done that inherited  depravity could do, to hinder the promise of Heaven from its  fulfilment. The cross, here as elsewhere, has been planted only to be  blasphemed by cruelty and fraud. The name of the Prince of Peace has  been profaned by all kinds of injustice toward the Gentile whom he  said he came to save. But I need not speak of what has been done  towards the Red Man, the Black Man. Those deeds are the scoff of the  world; and they have been accompanied by such pious words that the  gentlest would not dare to intercede with \"Father, forgive them, for  they know not what they do.\"    Here, as elsewhere, the gain of creation consists always in the growth  of individual minds, which live and aspire, as flowers bloom and birds  sing, in the midst of morasses; and in the continual development of  that thought, the thought of human destiny, which is given to eternity  adequately to express, and which ages of failure only seemingly  impede. Only seemingly; and whatever seems to the contrary, this  country is as surely destined to elucidate a great moral law, as  Europe was to promote the mental culture of Man.    Though the national independence be blurred by the servility of  individuals; though freedom and equality have been proclaimed only to  leave room for a monstrous display of slave-dealing and slave-keeping;  though the free American so often feels himself free, like the Roman,  only to pamper his appetites end his indolence through the misery of  his fellow-beings; still it is not in vain that the verbal statement  has been made, \"All men are born free and equal.\" There it stands, a  golden certainty wherewith to encourage the good, to shame the bad.  The New World may be called clearly to perceive that it incurs the  utmost penalty if it reject or oppress the sorrowful brother. And, if  men are deaf, the angels hear. But men cannot be deaf. It is  inevitable that an external freedom, an independence of the  encroachments of other men, such as has been achieved for the nation,  should be so also for every member of it. That which has once been  clearly conceived in the intelligence cannot fail, sooner or later, to  be acted out. It has become a law as irrevocable as that of the Medes  in their ancient dominion; men will privately sin against it, but the  law, as expressed by a leading mind of the age,      \"Tutti fatti a semblanza d'un Solo,    Figli tutti d'un solo riscatto,    In qual'ora, in qual parte del suolo    Trascorriamo quest' aura vital,    Siam fratelli, siam stretti ad un patto:    Maladetto colui che lo infrange,    Che s'innalza sul finoco che piange    Che contrista uno spirto immortal.\" [Footnote: Manzoni]      \"All made in the likeness of the One.      All children of one ransom,    In whatever hour, in whatever part of the soil,      We draw this vital air,    We are brothers; we must be bound by one compact;      Accursed he who infringes it,    Who raises himself upon the weak who weep,      Who saddens an immortal spirit.\"      This law cannot fail of universal recognition. Accursed be he who  willingly saddens an immortal spirit--doomed to infamy in later, wiser  ages, doomed in future stages of his own being to deadly penance, only  short of death. Accursed be he who sins in ignorance, if that  ignorance be caused by sloth.    We sicken no less at the pomp than the strife of words. We feel that  never were lungs so puffed with the wind of declamation, on moral and  religious subjects, as now. We are tempted to implore these  \"word-heroes,\" these word-Catos, word-Christs, to beware of cant  [Footnote: Dr. Johnson's one piece of advice should be written on  every door: \"Clear your mind of cant.\" But Byron, to whom it was so  acceptable, in clearing away the noxious vine, shook down the  building. Sterling's emendation is worthy of honor:      \"Realize your cant, not cast it off.\"]    above all things; to remember that hypocrisy is the most hopeless as  well as the meanest of crimes, and that those must surely be polluted  by it, who do not reserve a part of their morality and religion for  private use. Landor says that he cannot have a great deal of mind who  cannot afford to let the larger part of it lie fallow; and what is true  of genius is not less so of virtue. The tongue is a valuable member,  but should appropriate but a small part of the vital juices that are  needful all over the body. We feel that the mind may \"grow black and  rancid in the smoke\" even \"of altars.\" We start up from the harangue  to go into our closet and shut the door. There inquires the spirit,  \"Is this rhetoric the bloom of healthy blood, or a false pigment  artfully laid on?\" And yet again we know where is so much smoke, must  be some fire; with so much talk about virtue and freedom, must be  mingled some desire for them; that it cannot be in vain that such have  become the common topics of conversation among men, rather than schemes  for tyranny and plunder, that the very newspapers see it best to  proclaim themselves \"Pilgrims,\" \"Puritans,\" \"Heralds of Holiness.\" The  king that maintains so costly a retinue cannot be a mere boast, or  Carabbas fiction. We have waited here long in the dust; we are tired  and hungry; but the triumphal procession must appear at last.    Of all its banners, none has been more steadily upheld, and under none  have more valor and willingness for real sacrifices been shown,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8649"],[0,"Indian Tales (#4)"],[1,"\"Behold this walrus tooth.\"'    By Jove, what chaps those must have been, to go sailing all over the shop  never knowing where they'd fetch the land! Hah!\"    \"Charlie,\" I pleaded, \"if you'll only be sensible for a minute or two I'll  make our hero in our tale every inch as good as Othere.\"    \"Umph! Longfellow wrote that poem. I don't care about writing things any  more. I want to read.\" He was thoroughly out of tune now, and raging over  my own ill-luck, I left him.    Conceive yourself at the door of the world's treasure-house guarded by a  child--an idle irresponsible child playing knuckle-bones--on whose favor  depends the gift of the key, and you will imagine one half my torment.  Till that evening Charlie had spoken nothing that might not lie within the  experiences of a Greek galley-slave. But now, or there was no virtue in  books, he had talked of some desperate adventure of the Vikings, of  Thorfin Karlsefne's sailing to Wineland, which is America, in the ninth or  tenth century. The battle in the harbor he had seen; and his own death he  had described. But this was a much more startling plunge into the past.  Was it possible that he had skipped half a dozen lives and was then dimly  remembering some episode of a thousand years later? It was a maddening  jumble, and the worst of it was that Charlie Mears in his normal condition  was the last person in the world to clear it up. I could only wait and  watch, but I went to bed that night full of the wildest imaginings. There  was nothing that was not possible if Charlie's detestable memory only held  good.    I might rewrite the Saga of Thorfin Karlsefne as it had never been written  before, might tell the story of the first discovery of America, myself the  discoverer. But I was entirely at Charlie's mercy, and so long as there  was a three-and-six-penny Bohn volume within his reach Charlie would not  tell. I dared not curse him openly; I hardly dared jog his memory, for I  was dealing with the experiences of a thousand years ago, told through the  mouth of a boy of to-day; and a boy of to-day is affected by every change  of tone and gust of opinion, so that he lies even when he desires to speak  the truth.    I saw no more of him for nearly a week. When next I met him it was in  Gracechurch Street with a billhook chained to his waist. Business took him  over London Bridge and I accompanied him. He was very full of the  importance of that book and magnified it. As we passed over the Thames we  paused to look at a steamer unloading great slabs of white and brown  marble. A barge drifted under the steamer's stern and a lonely cow in that  barge bellowed. Charlie's face changed from the face of the bank-clerk to  that of an unknown and--though he would not have believed this--a much  shrewder man. He flung out his arm across the parapet of the bridge and  laughing very loudly, said:    \"When they heard _our_ bulls bellow the Skroelings ran away!\"    I waited only for an instant, but the barge and the cow had disappeared  under the bows of the steamer before I answered.    \"Charlie, what do you suppose are Skroelings?\"    \"Never heard of 'em before. They sound like a new kind of seagull. What a  chap you are for asking questions!\" he replied. \"I have to go to the  cashier of the Omnibus Company yonder. Will you wait for me and we can  lunch somewhere together? I've a notion for a poem.\"    \"No, thanks. I'm off. You're sure you know nothing about Skroelings?\"    \"Not unless he's been entered for the Liverpool Handicap.\" He nodded and  disappeared in the crowd.    Now it is written in the Saga of Eric the Red or that of Thorfin  Karlsefne, that nine hundred years ago when Karlsefne's galleys came to  Leif's booths, which Leif had erected in the unknown land called Markland,  which may or may not have been Rhode Island, the Skroelings--and the Lord  He knows who these may or may not have been--came to trade with the  Vikings, and ran away because they were frightened at the bellowing of the  cattle which Thorfin had brought with him in the ships. But what in the  world could a Greek slave know of that affair? I wandered up and down  among the streets trying to unravel the mystery, and the more I considered  it, the more baffling it grew. One thing only seemed certain, and that  certainty took away my breath for the moment. If I came to full knowledge  of anything at all it would not be one life of the soul in Charlie Mears's  body, but half a dozen--half a dozen several and separate existences spent  on blue water in the morning of the world!    Then I walked round the situation.    Obviously if I used my knowledge I should stand alone and unapproachable  until all men were as wise as myself. That would be something, but manlike  I was ungrateful. It seemed bitterly unfair that Charlie's memory should  fail me when I needed it most. Great Powers above--I looked up at them  through the fog smoke--did the Lords of Life and Death know what this  meant to me? Nothing less than eternal fame of the best kind, that comes  from One, and is shared by one alone. I would be content--remembering  Clive, I stood astounded at my own moderation,--with the mere right to  tell one story, to work out one little contribution to the light  literature of the day. If Charlie were permitted full recollection for one  hour--for sixty short minutes--of existences that had extended over a  thousand years--I would forego all profit and honor from all that I should  make of his speech. I would take no share in the commotion that would  follow throughout the particular corner of the earth that calls itself  \"the world.\" The thing should be put forth anonymously. Nay, I would make  other men believe that they had written it. They would hire bull-hided  self-advertising Englishmen to bellow it abroad. Preachers would found a  fresh conduct of life upon it, swearing that it was new and that they had  lifted the fear of death from all mankind. Every Orientalist in Europe  would patronize it discursively with Sanskrit and Pali texts. Terrible  women would invent unclean variants of the men's belief for the elevation  of their sisters. Churches and religions would war over it. Between the  hailing and re-starting of an omnibus I foresaw the scuffles that would  arise among half a dozen denominations all professing \"the doctrine of the  True Metempsychosis as applied to the world and the New Era\"; and saw,  too, the respectable English newspapers shying, like frightened kine, over  the beautiful simplicity of the tale. The mind leaped forward a  hundred--two hundred--a thousand years. I saw with sorrow that men would  mutilate and garble the story; that rival creeds would turn it upside down  till, at last, the western world which clings to the dread of death more  closely than the hope of life, would set it aside as an interesting  superstition and stampede after some faith so long forgotten that it  seemed altogether new. Upon this I changed the terms of the bargain that I  would make with the Lords of Life and Death. Only let me know, let me  write, the story with sure knowledge that I wrote the truth, and I would  burn the manuscript as a solemn sacrifice. Five minutes after the last  line was written I would destroy it all. But I must be allowed to write it  with absolute certainty.    There was no answer. The flaming colors of an Aquarium poster caught my  eye and I wondered whether it would be wise or prudent to lure Charlie  into the hands of the professional mesmerist, and whether, if he were  under his power, he would speak of his past lives. If he did, and if  people believed him ... but Charlie would be frightened and flustered, or  made conceited by the interviews. In either case he would begin to lie,  through fear or vanity. He was safest in my own hands,    \"They are very funny fools, your English,\" said a voice at my elbow, and  turning round I recognized a casual acquaintance, a young Bengali law  student, called Grish Chunder, whose father had sent him to England to  become civilized. The old man was a retired native official, and on an  income of five pounds a month contrived to allow his son two hundred  pounds a year, and the run of his teeth in a city where he could pretend  to be the cadet of a royal house, and tell stories of the brutal Indian  bureaucrats who ground the faces of the poor.    Grish Chunder was a young, fat, full-bodied Bengali dressed with  scrupulous care in frock coat, tall hat, light trousers and tan gloves.  But I had known him in the days when the brutal Indian Government paid for  his university education, and he contributed cheap sedition to _Sachi  Durpan_, and intrigued with the wives of his schoolmates.    \"That is very funny and very foolish,\" he said, nodding at the poster. \"I  am going down to the Northbrook Club. Will you come too?\"    I walked with him for some time. \"You are not well,\" he said. \"What is  there in your mind? You do not talk.\"    \"Grish Chunder, you've been too well educated to believe in a God, haven't  you?\"    \"Oah, yes, _here!_ But when I go home I must conciliate popular  superstition, and make ceremonies of purification, and my women will  anoint idols.\"    \"And hang up _tulsi_ and feast the _purohit_, and take you back into caste  again and make a good _khuttri_ of you again, you advanced social  Free-thinker. And you'll eat _desi_ food, and like it all, from the smell  in the courtyard to the mustard oil over you.\"    \"I shall very much like it,\" said Grish Chunder, unguardedly, \"Once a  Hindu--always a Hindu. But I like to know what the English think they  know.\"    \"I'll tell you something that one Englishman knows. It's an old tale to  you.\"    I began to tell the story of Charlie in English, but Grish Chunder put a  question in the vernacular, and the history went forward naturally in the  tongue best suited for its telling. After all it could never have been  told in English. Grish Chunder heard me, nodding"]]]
