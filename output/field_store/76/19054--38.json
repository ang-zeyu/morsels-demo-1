The  first sight of a blue-eyed, sunny-haired girl, a year and more before,  had struck deep into his unconscious heart; a second sight had made her  an unforgettable reality: and a third had been the realization of love.    It was sad, regrettable, incomprehensible, and yet somehow his inner  being swelled and throbbed. Her name was Lenore Anderson. Her father was  one of the richest men in the state of Washington. She had one brother,  Jim, who would not wait for the army draft. Kurt trembled and a hot rush  of tears dimmed his eyes. All at once his lot seemed unbearable. An  immeasurable barrier had arisen between him and his old father--a  hideous thing of blood, of years, of ineradicable difference; the broad  acres of wheatland so dear to him were to be taken from him; love had  overcome him with headlong rush, a love that could never be returned;  and cruelest of all, there was the war calling him to give up his home,  his father, his future, and to go out to kill and to be killed.    It came to him while he leaned there, that, remembering the light of  Lenore Anderson's eyes, he could not give up to bitterness and hatred,  whatever his misfortunes and his fate. She would never be anything to  him, but he and her brother Jim and many other young Americans must be  incalculable all to her. That thought saved Kurt Dorn. There were other  things besides his own career, his happiness; and the way he was placed,  however unfortunate from a selfish point of view, must not breed a  morbid self-pity.    The moment of his resolution brought a flash, a revelation of what he  owed himself. The work and the thought and the feeling of his last few  weeks there at home must be intensified. He must do much and live  greatly in little time. This was the moment of his renunciation, and he  imagined that many a young man who had decided to go to war had  experienced a strange spiritual division of self. He wondered also if  that moment was not for many of them a let-down, a throwing up of  ideals, a helpless retrograding and surrender to the brutalizing spirit  of war. But it could never be so for him. It might have been had not  that girl come into his life.    The bell for the midday meal roused Kurt from his profound reverie, and  he plodded back to the house. Down through the barnyard gate he saw the  hired men coming, and a second glance discovered to him that two unknown  men were with them. Watching for a moment, Kurt recognized the two  strangers that had been talking to Mr. Anderson's driver. They seemed to  be talking earnestly now. Kurt saw Jerry, a trusty and long-tried  employee, rather unceremoniously break away from these strangers. But  they followed him, headed him off, and with vehement nods and  gesticulations appeared to be arguing with him. The other hired men  pushed closer, evidently listening. Finally Jerry impatiently broke away  and tramped toward the house. These strangers sent sharp words after  him--words that Kurt could not distinguish, though he caught the tone of  scorn. Then the two individuals addressed themselves to the other men;  and in close contact the whole party passed out of sight behind the  barn.    Thoughtfully Kurt went into the house. He meant to speak to Jerry about  the strangers, but he wanted to consider the matter first. He had  misgivings. His father was not in the sitting-room, nor in the kitchen.  Dinner was ready on the table, and the one servant, an old woman who had  served the Dorns for years, appeared impatient at the lack of promptness  in the men. Both father and son, except on Sundays, always ate with the  hired help. Kurt stepped outside to find Jerry washing at the bench.    \"Jerry, what's keeping the men?\" queried Kurt.    \"Wal, they're palaverin' out there with two I.W.W. fellers,\" replied  Jerry.    Kurt reached for the rope of the farm-bell, and rang it rather sharply.  Then he went in to take his place at the table, and Jerry soon followed.  Old man Dorn did not appear, which fact was not unusual. The other hired  men did not enter until Jerry and Kurt were half done with the meal.  They seemed excited and somewhat boisterous, Kurt thought, but once they  settled down to eating, after the manner of hungry laborers, they had  little to say. Kurt, soon finishing his dinner, went outdoors to wait  for Jerry. That individual appeared to be long in coming, and loud  voices in the kitchen attested to further argument. At last, however, he  lounged out and began to fill a pipe.    \"Jerry, I want to talk to you,\" said Kurt. \"Let's get away from the  house.\"    The hired man was a big, lumbering fellow, gnarled like an old oak-tree.  He had a good-natured face and honest eyes.    \"I reckon you want to hear about them I.W.W. fellers?\" he asked, as they  walked away.    \"Yes,\" replied Kurt.    \"There's been a regular procession of them fellers, the last week or so,  walkin' through the country,\" replied Jerry. \"To-day's the first time  any of them got to me. But I've heerd talk. Sunday when I was in Palmer  the air was full of rumors.\"    \"Rumors of what?\" queried Kurt.    \"All kinds,\" answered Jerry, nonchalantly scratching his stubby beard.  \"There's an army of I.W.W.'s comin' in from eastward. Idaho an' Montana  are gittin' a dose now. Short hours; double wages; join the union;  sabotage, whatever thet is; capital an' labor fight; threats if you  don't fall in line; an' Lord knows what all.\"    \"What did those two fellows want of you?\"    \"Wanted us to join the I.W.W.,\" replied the laborer.    \"Did they want a job?\"    \"Not as I heerd. Why, one of them had a wad of bills thet would choke a  cow. He did most of the talkin'. The little feller with the beady eyes  an' the pock-marks, he didn't say much. He's Austrian an' not long in  this country. The big stiff--Glidden, he called himself--must be some  shucks in thet I.W.W. He looked an' talked oily at first--very  persuadin'; but when I says I wasn't goin' to join no union he got sassy  an' bossy. They made me sore, so I told him to go to hell. Then he said  the I.W.W. would run the whole Northwest this summer--wheat-fields,  lumberin', fruit-harvestin', railroadin'--the whole kaboodle, an' thet  any workman who wouldn't join would git his, all right.\"    \"Well, Jerry, what do you think about this organization?\" queried Kurt,  anxiously.    \"Not much. It ain't a square deal. I ain't got no belief in them. What I  heerd of their threatenin' methods is like the way this Glidden talks.  If I owned a farm I'd drive such fellers off with a whip. There's goin'  to be bad doin's if they come driftin' strong into the Bend.\"    \"Jerry, are you satisfied with your job?\"    \"Sure. I won't join the I.W.W. An' I'll talk ag'in' it. I reckon a few  of us will hev to do all the harvestin'. An', considerin' thet, I'll  take a dollar a day more on my wages.\"    \"If father does not agree to that, I will,\" said Kurt. \"Now how about  the other men?\"    \"Wal, they all air leanin' toward promises of little work an' lots of  pay,\" answered Jerry, with a laugh. \"Morgan's on the fence about  joinin'. But Andrew agreed. He's Dutch an' pig-headed. Jansen's only too  glad to make trouble fer his boss. They're goin' to lay off the rest of  to-day an' talk with Glidden. They all agreed to meet down by the  culvert. An' thet's what they was arguin' with me fer--wanted me to  come.\"    \"Where's this man Glidden?\" demanded Kurt. \"I'll give him a piece of my  mind.\"    \"I reckon he's hangin' round the farm--out of sight somewhere.\"    \"All right, Jerry. Now you go back to work. You'll never lose anything  by sticking to us, I promise you that. Keep your eyes and ears open.\"    Kurt strode back to the house, and his entrance to the kitchen evidently  interrupted a colloquy of some kind. The hired men were still at table.  They looked down at their plates and said nothing. Kurt left the  sitting-room door open, and, turning, he asked Martha if his father had  been to dinner.    \"No, an' what's more, when I called he takes to roarin' like a mad  bull,\" replied the woman.    Kurt crossed the sitting-room to knock upon his father's door. The reply  forthcoming did justify the old woman's comparison. It certainly caused  the hired men to evacuate the kitchen with alacrity. Old Chris Dorn's  roar at his son was a German roar, which did not soothe the young man's  rising temper. Of late the father had taken altogether to speaking  German. He had never spoken English well. And Kurt was rapidly  approaching the point where he would not speak German. A deadlock was in  sight, and Kurt grimly prepared to meet it. He pounded on the locked  door.    \"The men are going to lay off,\" he called.    \"Who runs this farm?\" was the thundered reply.    \"The I.W.W. is going to run it if you sulk indoors as you have done  lately,\" yelled Kurt. He thought that would fetch his father stamping  out, but he had reckoned falsely. There was no further sound. Leaving  the room in high dudgeon, Kurt hurried out to catch the hired men near  at hand and to order them back to work. They trudged off surlily toward  the barn.    Then Kurt went on to search for the I.W.W. men, and after looking up and  down the road, and all around, he at length found them behind an old  strawstack. They were comfortably sitting down, backs to the straw,  eating a substantial lunch. Kurt was angry and did not care. His  appearance, however, did not faze the strangers. One of them, an  American, was a man of about thirty years, clean-shaven, square-jawed,  with light, steely, secretive gray eyes, and a look of intelligence and  assurance that did not harmonize with his motley garb. His companion was  a foreigner, small of stature, with eyes like a ferret and deep pits in  his sallow face.    \"Do you know you're trespassing?\" demanded Kurt.    \"You grudge us a little shade, eh, even to eat a bite?\" said the  American. He wrapped a paper round his lunch"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],[0,"Town Geology (#5)"],[1," people in God's   sight, than I, I fear, can pretend to be.    They used to say, \"This would be all very true if there were not a   curse upon the earth.\"  And then they seemed to deduce, from the fact   of that curse, a vague notion (for it was little more) that this   world was the devil's world, and that therefore physical facts could   not be trusted, because they were disordered, and deceptive, and what   not.    Now, in justice to the Bible, and in justice to the Church of   England, I am bound to say that such a statement, or anything like   it, is contrary to the doctrines of both.  It is contrary to   Scripture.  According to it, the earth is not cursed.  For it is said   in Gen. viii. 21, \"And the Lord said, I will not again curse the   ground any more for man's sake.  While the earth remaineth, seed-time   and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall   not cease.\"  According to Scripture, again, physical facts are not   disordered.  The Psalmist says, \"They continue this day according to   their ordinance; for all things serve Thee.\"  And again, \"Thou hast   made them fast for ever and ever.  Thou hast given them a law which   cannot be broken.\"    So does the Bible (not to quote over again the passages which I have   already given you from St. Paul, and One greater than St. Paul)   declare the permanence of natural laws, and the trustworthiness of   natural phenomena as obedient to God.  And so does the Church of   England.  For she has incorporated into her services that magnificent   hymn, which our forefathers called the Song of the Three Children;   which is, as it were, the very flower and crown of the Old Testament;   the summing up of all that is true and eternal in the old Jewish   faith; as true for us as for them:  as true millions of years hence   as it is now--which cries to all heaven and earth, from the skies   above our heads to the green herb beneath our feet, \"O all ye works   of the Lord, bless ye the Lord; praise Him and magnify Him for ever.\"    On that one hymn I take my stand.  That is my charter as a student of   Natural Science.  As long as that is sung in an English church, I   have a right to investigate Nature boldly without stint or stay, and   to call on all who have the will, to investigate her boldly likewise,   and with Socrates of old, to follow the Logos whithersoever it leads.    The Logos.  I must pause on that word.  It meant at first, no doubt,   simply speech, argument, reason.  In the mind of Socrates it had a   deeper meaning, at which he only dimly guessed; which was seen more   clearly by Philo and the Alexandrian Jews; which was revealed in all   its fulness to the beloved Apostle St. John, till he gathered speech   to tell men of a Logos, a Word, who was in the beginning with God,   and was God; by whom all things were made, and without Him was not   anything made that was made; and how in Him was Life, and the Life   was the light of men; and that He was none other than Jesus Christ   our Lord.    Yes, that is the truth.  And to that truth no man can add, and from   it no man can take away.  And as long as we believe that as long as   we believe that in His light alone can we see light--as long as we   believe that the light around us, whether physical or spiritual, is   given by Him without whom nothing is made--so long we shall not fear   to meet Light, so long we shall not fear to investigate Life; for we   shall know, however strange or novel, beautiful or awful, the   discoveries we make may be, we are only following the Word   whithersoever He may lead us; and that He can never lead us amiss        I. THE SOIL OF THE FIELD {2}        My dear readers, let me, before touching on the special subject of   this paper, say a few words on that of the whole series.    It is geology:  that is, the science which explains to us the RIND of   the earth; of what it is made; how it has been made.  It tells us   nothing of the mass of the earth.  That is, properly speaking, an   astronomical question.  If I may be allowed to liken this earth to a   fruit, then astronomy will tell us--when it knows--how the fruit   grew, and what is inside the fruit.  Geology can only tell us at most   how its rind, its outer covering, grew, and of what it is composed; a   very small part, doubtless, of all that is to be known about this   planet.    But as it happens, the mere rind of this earth-fruit which has,   countless ages since, dropped, as it were, from the Bosom of God, the   Eternal Fount of Life--the mere rind of this earth-fruit, I say, is   so beautiful and so complex, that it is well worth our awful and   reverent study.  It has been well said, indeed, that the history of   it, which we call geology, would be a magnificent epic poem, were   there only any human interest in it; did it deal with creatures more   like ourselves than stones, and bones, and the dead relics of plants   and beasts.  Whether there be no human interest in geology; whether   man did not exist on the earth during ages which have seen enormous   geological changes, is becoming more and more an open question.    But meanwhile all must agree that there is matter enough for   interest--nay, room enough for the free use of the imagination, in a   science which tells of the growth and decay of whole mountain-ranges,   continents, oceans, whole tribes and worlds of plants and animals.    And yet it is not so much for the vastness and grandeur of those   scenes of the distant past, to which the science of geology   introduces us, that I value it as a study, and wish earnestly to   awaken you to its beauty and importance.  It is because it is the   science from which you will learn most easily a sound scientific   habit of thought.  I say most easily; and for these reasons.  The   most important facts of geology do not require, to discover them, any   knowledge of mathematics or of chemical analysis; they may be studied   in every bank, every grot, every quarry, every railway-cutting, by   anyone who has eyes and common sense, and who chooses to copy the   late illustrious Hugh Miller, who made himself a great geologist out   of a poor stonemason.  Next, its most important theories are not, or   need not be, wrapped up in obscure Latin and Greek terms.  They may   be expressed in the simplest English, because they are discovered by   simple common sense.  And thus geology is (or ought to be), in   popular parlance, the people's science--the science by studying   which, the man ignorant of Latin, Greek, mathematics, scientific   chemistry, can yet become--as far as his brain enables him--a truly   scientific man.    But how shall we learn science by mere common sense?    First.  Always try to explain the unknown by the known.  If you meet   something which you have not seen before, then think of the thing   most like it which you have seen before; and try if that which you   know explains the one will not explain the other also.  Sometimes it   will; sometimes it will not.  But if it will, no one has a right to   ask you to try any other explanation.    Suppose, for instance, that you found a dead bird on the top of a   cathedral tower, and were asked how you thought it had got there.    You would say, \"Of course, it died up here.\"  But if a friend said,   \"Not so; it dropped from a balloon, or from the clouds;\" and told you   the prettiest tale of how the bird came to so strange an end, you   would answer, \"No, no; I must reason from what I know.  I know that   birds haunt the cathedral tower; I know that birds die; and   therefore, let your story be as pretty as it may, my common sense   bids me take the simplest explanation, and say--it died here.\"  In   saying that, you would be talking scientifically.  You would have   made a fair and sufficient induction (as it is called) from the facts   about birds' habits and birds' deaths which you know.    But suppose that when you took the bird up you found that it was   neither a jackdaw, nor a sparrow nor a swallow, as you expected, but   a humming-bird.  Then you would be adrift again.  The fact of it   being a humming-bird would be a new fact which you had not taken into   account, and for which your old explanation was not sufficient; and   you would have to try a new induction--to use your common sense   afresh--saying, \"I have not to explain merely how a dead bird got   here, but how a dead humming-bird.\"    And now, if your imaginative friend chimed in triumphantly with:  \"Do   you not see that I was right after all?  Do you not see that it fell   from the clouds? that it was swept away hither, all the way from   South America, by some south-westerly storm, and wearied out at last,   dropped here to find rest, as in a sacred-place?\" what would you   answer?  \"My friend, that is a beautiful imagination; but I must   treat it only as such, as long as I can explain the mystery more   simply by facts which I do know.  I do not know that humming-birds   can be blown across the Atlantic alive.  I do know they are actually   brought across the Atlantic dead; are stuck in ladies' hats.  I know   that ladies visit the cathedral; and odd as the accident is, I prefer   to believe, till I get a better explanation, that the humming-bird   has simply dropped out of a lady's hat.\"  There, again, you would be   speaking common sense; and using, too, sound inductive method; trying   to explain what you do not know from what you do know already.    Now, I ask of you to employ the same common sense when you read and   think of Geology.    It is very necessary to do so.  For in past times men have tried to   explain the making of the world around them, its oceans, rivers,   mountains, and continents, by I know not what of fancied cataclysms   and convulsions of nature; explaining the unknown by the still more   unknown, till some of their geological theories were no more   rational, because no more founded on known facts, than that of the   New "]]]
