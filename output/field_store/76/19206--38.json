For did he not almost have five hundred million dollars--two  and a half _milliards_ of francs--in his very hands? _Hein_? But he did!  Does M'sieu' have doubts? Nevertheless it is all true. _C'est trop  vrai_! Is M'sieu' tired? And would he care to hear the story? There is a  comfortable chair _sous le grand arbre_ in front of the veranda, and  Madame will give M'sieu' a glass of wine from the presses, across the  road. Yes, it _is_ good wine, but there is little profit in it, when one  thinks in _milliards_.    The landowner lights his pipe and seats himself cross-legged against the  trunk of the big chestnut. Back of the house the vineyard slopes away  toward the distant woods in straight, green, trellised alleys. A dim  haze hangs over the landscape sleeping so quietly in the midsummer  afternoon. Down the road comes heavily, creaking and swaying, a wain  loaded with a huge tower of empty casks and drawn by two oxen, their  heads swinging to the dust. Yes, it is hard to _comprendre_ twenty-five  hundred million francs.    It was this way. Madame Lapierre was a Tessier of Bordeaux--an ancient  _bourgeois_ family, and very proud indeed of being _bourgeois_. You can  see her passing and repassing the window if you watch carefully the  kitchen, where she is superintending dinner. The Tessiers have always  lived in Bordeaux and they are connected by marriage with  everybody--from the blacksmith up to the Mayor's notary. Once a Tessier  was Mayor himself. Years and years ago Madame's great-uncle Jean had  emigrated to America, and from time to time vague rumors of the wealth  he had achieved in the new country reached the ears of his  relatives--but no direct word ever came.    Then one hot day--like this--appeared M. le General. He came walking  down the road in the dust from the _gare_, in his tall silk hat and  frock coat and gold-headed cane, and stopped before the house to ask if  one of the descendants of a certain Jean Tessier did not live  hereabouts. He was fat and red-faced, and he perspired, but--_Dieu_!--he  was _distingue_, and he had an order in his buttonhole. Madame Lapierre,  who came out to answer his question, knew at once that he was an  aristocrat.    Ah! was she herself the grandniece of Jean Tessier? Then, Heaven be  thanked! the General's toilsome journey was ended. He had much to tell  them--when he should be rested. He removed the silk hat and mopped his  shining forehead. He must introduce himself that he might have credit  with Madame, else she might hardly listen to his story, for there had  never been a tale like it before since the world was. Let him present  himself--M. le General Pedro Suarez de Moreno, Count de Tinoco and  Marquis de la d'Essa. Although one was fatigued it refreshed one to be  the bearer of good news, and such was his mission. Let Madame prepare  herself to hear. Yes, it would be proper for her to call M'sieu', her  husband, that he might participate.    Over a draft of this same vintage M. le General imparted to them the  secret. Lapierre laughs and shrugs his shoulders as he recalls the  scene--the apoplectic General, with the glass of wine in one hand,  waving the other grandiloquently as he described the wealth about to  descend upon them.    Yes, the General must begin at the beginning, for it was a long story.  First, as to himself and how he came to know of the affair. It had been  on his return from the Philippines after the surrender of Manila, where  he had been in command of the armies of Spain, that he had paused for  repose in New York and had first learned of the Tessier inheritance. The  precise manner of his discovery was left somewhat indefinite, but the  Lapierres were not particular. So many distinguished persons had played  a part in the drama that the recital left but a vague impression as to  individuals. A certain Madame Luchia, widow of one Roquefailaire, whom  he had accidentally met, had apparently been the instrument of  Providence in disclosing the history of Jean Tessier to the General. She  herself had been wronged by the villains and knew all the secrets of the  conspirators. But she had waited for a suitable opportunity to speak.  Jean Tessier had died possessed of properties which to-day, seventy  years after, were worth in the neighborhood of five hundred million  dollars! The General paused for the effect, solemnly nodding his head  at his astounded auditors in affirmance. Yes, it was even so!    Five hundred million dollars! No more--and no less! Then he once more  took up the thread of his narrative.    Tessier's lands, originally farms, were to-day occupied by huge  _magasins_, government buildings, palaces and hotels. He had been a  frugal, hardworking, far-seeing man of affairs whose money had doubled  itself year by year. Then had appeared one Emmeric Lespinasse, a  Frenchman, also from Bordeaux, who had plotted to rob him of his estate,  and the better to accomplish his purpose had entered the millionaire's  employ. When Tessier died, in 1884, Lespinasse had seized his papers and  the property, destroyed his will, dispersed the clerks, secretaries,  \"notaries\" and accountants of the deceased, and quietly got rid of such  persons as stood actively in his way. The great wealth thus acquired had  enabled him to defy those who knew that he was not entitled to the  fortune, and that the real heirs were in far-away France.    He had prospered like the bay tree. His daughter, Marie Louise, had  married a distinguished English nobleman, and his sons were now the  richest men in America. Yet they lived with the sword of Damocles over  their heads, suspended by a single thread, and the General had the knife  wherewith to cut it. Lespinasse, among other things, had caused the  murder of the husband of Madame Luchia, and she was in possession of  conclusive proofs which, at the proper moment, could be produced to  convict him of his many crimes, or at least to oust his sons and  daughter from the stolen inheritance.    It was a weird, bizarre nightmare, no more astonishing than the novels  the Lapierres had read. America, they understood, was a land where the  rivers were full of gold--a country of bronzed and handsome savages, of  birds of paradise and ruined Aztec temples, of vast tobacco fields and  plantations of thousands of acres of cotton cultivated by naked slaves,  while one lay in a hammock fanned by a \"_petite negre_\" and languidly  sipped _eau sucree_. The General had made it all seem very, very real.  At the weak spots he had gesticulated convincingly and digressed upon  his health. Then, while the narrative was fresh and he might have had to  answer questions about it had he given his listeners opportunity to ask  them, he had hastily told of a visit to Tunis. There he had by chance  encountered Marie Louise, the daughter of Lespinasse, living with her  noble husband in a \"handsome Oriental palace,\" had been invited to dine  with them and had afterward seized the occasion while \"walking in the  garden\" with the lady to disclose the fact that he knew all, and had it  in his power to ruin them as impostors. Marie Louise had been  frightfully angry, but afterward her better nature had suggested the  return of the inheritance, or at least a hundred millions or so, to the  rightful heirs. The General had left the palace believing all would be  well, and had retired to Paris to await letters and further  developments, but these had never come, and he had discovered that he  had been deceived. It had been merely a ruse on the part of the woman  and her husband to gain time, and now every step that he took was dogged  by spies in the pay of the Lespinasses, who followed him everywhere. But  the right would triumph! He had sworn to run the conspiracy to earth!    Many hours were consumed in the telling of the story. The Lapierres were  enchanted. More than that, they were convinced--persuaded that they were  heirs to the richest inheritance in the world, which comprised most of  the great American city of New York.    Persons who were going to participate in twenty-five hundred millions of  francs could afford to be hospitable. M. le General stayed to dinner. A  list of the heirs living in or near Bordeaux was made out with the share  of each in the inheritance carefully computed. Madame Lapierre's was  only fifty million dollars--but still that was almost enough to buy up  Bordeaux. And they could purchase Monsegur as a country place. The  General spoke of a stable of automobiles by means of which the journey  from Bordeaux to the farm could be accomplished in the space of an hour.    That night the good man and his wife scarcely closed their eyes, and the  next day, accompanied by the General, they visited Bordeaux and the  neighboring towns and broke the news gently to the other heirs. There  was M. Pettit, the veterinary at Mormand; Tessier, the blacksmith in  Bordeaux; M. Pelegue and his wife, M. Rozier, M. Cazenava and his son,  and others. One branch of the family lived in Brazil--the Joubin Freres  and one Tessier of \"Saint Bezeille.\" These last had to be reached by  post, a most annoyingly slow means of communication--_mais que  voulez-vous_?    Those were busy days in and around Bordeaux, and the General was the  centre of attraction. What a splendid figure he cut in his tall silk hat  and gold-headed cane! But they were all very careful to let no inkling  of their good fortune leak out, for it might spoil everything--give some  opportunity to the spies of the impostor Lespinasse to fabricate new  chains of title or to prepare for a defense of the fortune. The little  blacksmith, being addicted to white wine, was the only one who did not  keep his head. But even he managed to hold his mouth sufficiently shut.  A family council was held; M. le General was given full power of  attorney to act for all the heirs; and each having contributed an  insignificant sum toward his necessary expenses, they waved him a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13177"],[0,"Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes and Home Made Candy Recipes (#5)"],[1,"of the eggs, well beaten; then set away to cool. When cool  add the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Pour the batter  into a well-buttered earthen dish that will hold about a quart, and cook  in a moderate oven for twenty-two minutes. Serve immediately with  vanilla cream sauce.      CHOCOLATE PUDDING    Reserve one gill of milk from a quart, and put the remainder on the fire  in a double-boiler. Mix three tablespoonfuls of cornstarch with the cold  milk. Beat two eggs with half a cupful of powdered sugar and half a  teaspoonful of salt. Add this to the cornstarch and milk, and stir into  the boiling milk, beating well for a minute. Shave fine two ounces of  Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it into a small  pan with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of boiling water. Stir  over a hot fire until smooth and glossy; then beat into the hot pudding.  Cook the pudding in all ten minutes, counting from the time the eggs and  cornstarch are added. Serve cold with powdered sugar and cream. This  pudding can be poured while hot into little cups which have been rinsed  in cold water. At serving time turn out on a flat dish, making a circle,  and fill the center of the dish with whipped cream flavored with sugar  and vanilla.    The eggs may be omitted, in which case use one more tablespoonful of  cornstarch.      CHOCOLATE MERINGUE PUDDING    For a small pudding use one pint of milk, two tablespoonfuls and a half  of cornstarch, one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate, two eggs,  five tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of  salt, and half a teaspoonful of vanilla extract.    Mix the cornstarch with one gill of the milk. Put the remainder of the  milk on to boil in the double-boiler. Scrape the chocolate. When the  milk boils, add the cornstarch, salt, and chocolate, and cook for ten  minutes. Beat the yolks of the eggs with three tablespoonfuls of sugar.  Pour the hot mixture on this, and beat well. Turn into a pudding-dish  that will hold about a quart, and bake for twenty minutes in a moderate  oven.    Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff, dry froth, and gradually beat in  the remaining two tablespoonfuls of sugar and the vanilla. Spread this  on the pudding, and return to the oven. Cook for fifteen minutes longer,  but with the oven-door open. Serve either cold or hot.      MILTON PUDDING    Use one pint of stale bread broken in crumbs, one quart of milk, two  eggs, half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon,  three tablespoonfuls of sugar and two ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s  Chocolate, grated. Put the bread, milk, cinnamon, and chocolate in a  bowl, and soak for two or three hours. Beat together the eggs, sugar,  and salt. Mash the soaked bread with a spoon, and add the egg mixture to  the bread and milk. Pour into a pudding-dish, and bake in a slow oven  for about forty minutes. Serve with an egg sauce or a vanilla cream  sauce.    EGG SAUCE.--Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff, dry froth; and beat  into this, a little at a time, one cupful of powdered sugar. When smooth  and light, add one teaspoonful of vanilla and the yolks of two eggs.  Beat the mixture a little longer; then stir in one cupful of whipped  cream or three tablespoonfuls of milk. Serve at once.    VANILLA CREAM SAUCE.--Beat to a cream three tablespoonfuls of butter,  and gradually beat into this two-thirds of a cupful of powdered sugar.  When this is light and creamy, add a teaspoonful of vanilla; then  gradually beat in two cupfuls of whipped cream. Place the bowl in a pan  of boiling water, and stir constantly for three minutes. Pour the sauce  into a warm bowl, and serve.      SNOW PUDDING    Put a pint of milk in the double-boiler and on the fire. Mix three  tablespoonfuls of cornstarch with a gill of milk and one-third of a  teaspoonful of salt. Stir this into the milk when it boils. Beat the  whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, and then gradually beat into them  half a cupful of powdered sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla. Add this  to the cooking mixture, and beat vigorously for one minute. Rinse a  mould in cold water, and pouring the pudding into it, set away to cool.  At serving-time turn out on a flat dish, and serve with chocolate sauce.      CHOCOLATE SAUCE    Put one pint of milk in the double-boiler, and on the fire. Shave two  ounces of Walter Baker and Co.'s Chocolate, and put it in a small pan  with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of boiling water. Stir over  the fire until smooth and glossy, and add to the hot milk. Beat together  for eight minutes the yolks of four eggs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar,  and a saltspoonful of salt, and then add one gill of cold milk.    Pour the boiling milk on this, stirring well. Return to the  double-boiler, and cook for five minutes, stirring all the time. Pour  into a cold bowl and set the bowl in cold water. Stir for a few minutes,  and then occasionally until the sauce is cold.    This sauce is nice for cold or hot cornstarch pudding, bread pudding,  cold cabinet pudding, snow pudding, etc. It will also answer for a  dessert. Fill custard glasses with it, and serve the same as soft  custard; or have the glasses two-thirds full, and heap up with whipped  cream.      CHOCOLATE CANDY    One cupful of molasses, two cupfuls of sugar, one cupful of milk,  one-half pound of chocolate, a piece of butter half the size of an egg.  Boil the milk and molasses together, scrape the chocolate fine, and mix  with just enough of the boiling milk and molasses to moisten; rub it  perfectly smooth, then, with the sugar, stir into the boiling liquid;  add the butter, and boil twenty minutes. Try as molasses candy, and if  it hardens, pour into a buttered dish. Cut the same as nut candy.      CREAM CHOCOLATE CARAMELS    Mix together in a granite-ware saucepan half a pint of sugar, half a  pint of molasses, half a pint of thick cream, one generous tablespoonful  of butter, and four ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1  Chocolate. Place on the fire and stir until the mixture boils. Cook  until a few drops of it will harden if dropped into ice-water; then pour  into well-buttered pans, having the mixture about three-fourths of an  inch deep. When nearly cold, mark into squares. It will take almost an  hour to boil this in a granite-ware pan, but not half so long if cooked  in an iron frying-pan. Stir frequently while boiling. The caramels must  be put in a very cold place to harden.      SUGAR CHOCOLATE CARAMELS    Mix two cupfuls of sugar, three-fourths of a cupful of milk or cream,  one generous tablespoonful of butter, and three ounces of Walter Baker &  Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate. Place on the fire and cook, stirring  often, until a little of the mixture, when dropped in ice-water, will  harden; then stir in one-fourth of a cupful of sugar and one  tablespoonful of vanilla, and pour into a well-buttered pan, having the  mixture about three-fourths of an inch deep. When nearly cold, mark it  off in squares, and put in a cold place to harden. These caramels are  sugary and brittle, and can be made in the hottest weather without  trouble. If a deep granite-ware saucepan be used for the boiling, it  will take nearly an hour to cook the mixture; but if with an iron  frying-pan, twenty or thirty minutes will suffice.      CHOCOLATE CREAMS, No. 1    Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth. Gradually beat into this  two cupfuls of confectioners' sugar. If the eggs be large, it may take a  little more sugar. Flavor with half a teaspoonful of vanilla, and work  well. Now roll into little balls, and drop on a slightly buttered  platter. Let the balls stand for an hour or more. Shave five ounces of  Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate and put into a small bowl,  which place on the fire in a saucepan containing boiling water. When the  chocolate is melted, take the saucepan to the table, and drop the creams  into the chocolate one at a time, taking them out with a fork and  dropping them gently on the buttered dish. It will take half an hour or  more to harden the chocolate.      CHOCOLATE CREAMS, No. 2    For these creams you should make a fondant in this way: put into a  granite-ware saucepan one cupful of water and two of granulated  sugar--or a pound of loaf sugar. Stir until the sugar is nearly melted,  then place on the fire and heat slowly, but do not stir the mixture.  Watch carefully and note when it begins to boil. When the sugar has been  boiling for ten minutes, take up a little of it and drop in ice-water.  If it hardens enough to form a soft ball when rolled between the thumb  and finger, it is cooked enough. Take the saucepan from the fire  instantly, and set in a cool, dry place. When the syrup is so cool that  the finger can be held in it comfortably, pour it into a bowl, and stir  with a wooden spoon until it becomes thick and white. When it begins to  look dry, and a little hard, take out the spoon, and work with the hand  until the cream is soft and smooth. Flavor with a few drops of vanilla,  and, after shaping, cover with chocolate, as directed in the preceding  recipe.    _Caution._--Do not stir the syrup while it is cooking, and be careful  not to jar or shake the saucepan.      CHOCOLATE CONES    Boil the sugar as directed for fondant in the recipe for Chocolate  Creams, No. 2, but not quite so long--say about eleven minutes. The  syrup, when tested, should be too soft to ball. When cold, pour into a  bowl, and beat until thick and creamy. If properly boiled, it will not  become thick enough to work with the hands.    Have six ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate melted  in a bowl. Pour half of the creamed sugar into another bowl, and, after  flavoring with a few drops of vanilla, add to it about one-third of the  dissolved chocolate. Stir until thick and rather dry; then make into  small cones, and drop on a slightly buttered platter. Put half of "]]]
