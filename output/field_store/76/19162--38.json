Before they reached him, after many vexatious delays,  he had given up waiting for the funds promised for his building  expenses, and removed from Benatek to Prague. It was during this  interval that after considerable negotiation, Kepler, who had been in  correspondence with Tycho, consented to join him as an assistant.  Another assistant, Longomontanus, who had been with Tycho at Uraniborg,  was finding difficulty with the long series of Mars observations, and it  was arranged that he should transfer his energies to the lunar  observations, leaving those of Mars for Kepler. Before very much could  be done with them, however, Tycho died at the end of October, 1601. He  may have regretted the peaceful island of Hveen, considering the  troubles in which Bohemia was rapidly becoming involved, but there is  little doubt that had it not been for his self-imposed exile, his  observations would not have come into Kepler's hands, and their great  value might have been lost. In any case it was at Uraniborg that the  mass of observations was produced upon which the fame of Tycho Brahe  rests. His own discoveries, though in themselves the most important made  in astronomy for many centuries, are far less valuable than those for  which his observations furnished the material. He discovered the third  and fourth inequalities of the moon in longitude, called respectively  the variation and the annual equation, also the variability of the  motion of the moon's nodes and the inclination of its orbit to the  ecliptic. He obtained an improved value of the constant of precession,  and did good service by rejecting the idea that it was variable, an idea  which, under the name of trepidation, had for many centuries been  accepted. He discovered the effect of refraction, though only  approximately its amount, and determined improved values of many other  astronomical constants, but singularly enough made no determination of  the distance of the sun, adopting instead the ancient and erroneous  value given by Hipparchus.    His magnificent Observatory of Uraniborg, the finest building for  astronomical purposes that the world had hitherto seen, was allowed to  fall into decay, and scarcely more than mere indications of the site may  now be seen.              CHAPTER IV.    KEPLER JOINS TYCHO.      The association of Kepler with Tycho was one of the most important  landmarks in the history of astronomy. The younger man hoped, by the aid  of Tycho's planetary observations, to obtain better support for some of  his fanciful speculative theories, while the latter, who had certainly  not gained in prestige by leaving Denmark, was in great need of a  competent staff of assistants. Of the two it would almost seem that  Tycho thought himself the greater gainer, for in spite of his reputation  for brusqueness and want of consideration, he not only made light of  Kepler's apology in the matter of Reymers, but treated him with uniform  kindness in the face of great rudeness and ingratitude. He begged him to  come \"as a welcome friend,\" though Kepler, very touchy on the subject of  his own astronomical powers, was afraid he might be regarded as simply a  subordinate assistant. An arrangement had been suggested by which Kepler  should obtain two years' leave of absence from Gratz on full pay, which,  because of the higher cost of living in Prague, should be supplemented  by the Emperor; but before this could be concluded, Kepler threw up his  professorship, and thinking he had thereby also lost the chance of going  to Prague, applied to Maestlin and others of his Tuebingen friends to  make interest for him with the Duke of Wurtemberg and secure the  professorship of medicine. Tycho, however, still urged him to come to  Prague, promising to do his utmost to secure for him a permanent  appointment, or in any event to see that he was not the loser by coming.  Kepler was delayed by illness on the way, but ultimately reached Prague,  accompanied by his wife, and for some time lived entirely at Tycho's  expense, writing by way of return essays against Reymers and another  man, who had claimed the credit of the Tychonic system. This Kepler  could do with a clear conscience, as it was only a question of priority  and did not involve any support of the system, which he deemed far  inferior to that of Copernicus. The following year saw friction between  the two astronomers, and we learn from Kepler's abject letter of apology  that he was entirely in the wrong. It was about money matters, which in  one way or another embittered the rest of Kepler's life, and it arose  during his absence from Prague. On his return in September, 1601, Tycho  presented him to the Emperor, who gave him the title of Imperial  Mathematician, on condition of assisting Tycho in his calculations, the  very thing Kepler was most anxious to be allowed to do: for nowhere else  in the world was there such a collection of good observations sufficient  for his purpose of reforming the whole theory of astronomy. The  Emperor's interest was still mainly with astrology, but he liked to  think that his name would be handed down to posterity in connection  with the new Planetary Tables in the same way as that of Alphonso of  Castile, and he made liberal promises to pay the expenses. Tycho's other  principal assistant, Longomontanus, did not stay long after giving up  the Mars observations to Kepler, but instead of working at the new lunar  theory, suddenly left to take up a professorship of astronomy in his  native Denmark. Very shortly afterwards Tycho himself died of acute  distemper; Kepler began to prepare the mass of manuscripts for  publication, but, as everything was claimed by the Brahe family, he was  not allowed to finish the work. He succeeded to Tycho's post of  principal mathematician to the Emperor, at a reduced official salary,  which owing to the emptiness of the Imperial treasury was almost always  in arrear. In order to meet his expenses he had recourse to the casting  of nativities, for which he gained considerable reputation and received  very good pay. He worked by the conventional rules of astrology, and was  quite prepared to take fees for so doing, although he had very little  faith in them, preferring his own fanciful ideas.    In 1604 the constellation of Cassiopeia was once more temporarily  enriched by the appearance of a new star, said by some to be brighter  than Tycho's nova, and by others to be twice as bright as Jupiter.  Kepler at once wrote a short account of it, from which may be gathered  some idea of his attitude towards astrology. Contrasting the two novae,  he says: \"Yonder one chose for its appearance a time no way remarkable,  and came into the world quite unexpectedly, like an enemy storming a  town and breaking into the market-place before the citizens are aware of  his approach; but ours has come exactly in the year of which astrologers  have written so much about the fiery trigon that happens in it; just in  the month in which (according to Cyprian), Mars comes up to a very  perfect conjunction with the other two superior planets; just in the day  when Mars has joined Jupiter, and just in the region where this  conjunction has taken place. Therefore the apparition of this star is  not like a secret hostile irruption, as was that one of 1572, but the  spectacle of a public triumph, or the entry of a mighty potentate; when  the couriers ride in some time before to prepare his lodgings, and the  crowd of young urchins begin to think the time over long to wait, then  roll in, one after another, the ammunition and money, and baggage  waggons, and presently the trampling of horse and the rush of people  from every side to the streets and windows; and when the crowd have  gazed with their jaws all agape at the troops of knights; then at last  the trumpeters and archers and lackeys so distinguish the person of the  monarch, that there is no occasion to point him out, but every one cries  of his own accord--'Here we have him'. What it may portend is hard to  determine, and this much only is certain, that it comes to tell mankind  either nothing at all or high and mighty news, quite beyond human sense  and understanding. It will have an important influence on political and  social relations; not indeed by its own nature, but as it were  accidentally through the disposition of mankind. First, it portends to  the booksellers great disturbances and tolerable gains; for almost every  _Theologus_, _Philosophicus_, _Medicus_, and _Mathematicus_, or whoever  else, having no laborious occupation entrusted to him, seeks his  pleasure _in studiis_, will make particular remarks upon it, and will  wish to bring these remarks to the light. Just so will others, learned  and unlearned, wish to know its meaning, and they will buy the authors  who profess to tell them. I mention these things merely by way of  example, because although thus much can be easily predicted without  great skill, yet may it happen just as easily, and in the same manner,  that the vulgar, or whoever else is of easy faith, or, it may be, crazy,  may wish to exalt himself into a great prophet; or it may even happen  that some powerful lord, who has good foundation and beginning of great  dignities, will be cheered on by this phenomenon to venture on some new  scheme, just as if God had set up this star in the darkness merely to  enlighten them.\" He made no secret of his views on conventional  astrology, as to which he claimed to speak with the authority of one  fully conversant with its principles, but he nevertheless expressed his  sincere conviction that the conjunctions and aspects of the planets  certainly did affect things on the earth, maintaining that he was driven  to this belief against his will by \"most unfailing experiences\".    Meanwhile the projected Rudolphine Tables were continually delayed by  the want of money.

Of our  three apartments, one is our sitting, eating, and _living_ room, and is  sixteen feet by fifteen. The walls are plastered indeed, but neither  painted nor papered; it is divided from our bed-room (a similarly elegant  and comfortable chamber) by a dingy wooden partition covered all over with  hooks, pegs, and nails, to which hats, caps, keys, &c. &c., are suspended  in graceful irregularity. The doors open by wooden latches, raised by  means of small bits of packthread--I imagine, the same primitive order of  fastening celebrated in the touching chronicle of Red Riding Hood; how  they shut I will not pretend to describe, as the shutting of a door is a  process of extremely rare occurrence throughout the whole Southern  country. The third room, a chamber with sloping ceiling, immediately over  our sitting-room and under the roof, is appropriated to the nurse and my  two babies. Of the closets, one is Mr. ---- the overseer's bed-room, the  other his office or place of business; and the third, adjoining our  bed-room, and opening immediately out of doors, is Mr. ----'s dressing  room and cabinet d'affaires, where he gives audiences to the negroes,  redresses grievances, distributes red woollen caps (a singular  gratification to a slave), shaves himself, and performs the other offices  of his toilet. Such being our abode, I think you will allow there is  little danger of my being dazzled by the luxurious splendours of a  Southern slave residence. Our sole mode of summoning our attendants is by  a packthread bell-rope suspended in the sitting-room. From the bed-rooms  we have to raise the windows and our voices, and bring them by power of  lungs, or help ourselves--which, I thank God, was never yet a hardship to  me.    I mentioned to you just now that two of the carpenters had made a boat in  their leisure time. I must explain this to you, and this will involve the  mention of another of Miss Martineau's mistakes with regard to slave  labour, at least in many parts of the Southern States. She mentions that  on one estate of which she knew, the proprietor had made the experiment,  and very successfully, of appointing to each of his slaves a certain task  to be performed in the day, which once accomplished, no matter how early,  the rest of the four and twenty hours were allowed to the labourer to  employ as he pleased. She mentions this as a single experiment, and  rejoices over it as a decided amelioration in the condition of the slave,  and one deserving of general adoption. But in the part of Georgia where  this estate is situated, the custom of task labour is universal, and it  prevails, I believe, throughout Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of  North Carolina; in other parts of the latter State, however--as I was  informed by our overseer, who is a native of that State--the estates are  small, rather deserving the name of farms, and the labourers are much  upon the same footing as the labouring men at the North, working from  sunrise to sunset in the fields with the farmer and his sons, and coming  in with them to their meals, which they take immediately after the rest of  the family. In Louisiana and the new South-western Slave States, I  believe, task labour does not prevail; but it is in those that the  condition of the poor human cattle is most deplorable, as you know it was  there that the humane calculation was not only made, but openly and  unhesitatingly avowed, that the planters found it upon the whole their  most profitable plan to work off (kill with labour) their whole number of  slaves about once in seven years, and renew the whole stock. By the bye,  the Jewish institution of slavery is much insisted upon by the Southern  upholders of the system; perhaps this is their notion of the Jewish  jubilee, when the slaves were by Moses' strict enactment to be all set  free. Well, this task system is pursued on this estate; and thus it is  that the two carpenters were enabled to make the boat they sold for sixty  dollars. These tasks, of course, profess to be graduated according to the  sex, age, and strength of the labourer; but in many instances this is not  the case, as I think you will agree when I tell you that on Mr. ----'s  first visit to his estates he found that the men and the women who  laboured in the fields had the same task to perform. This was a noble  admission of female equality, was it not?--and thus it had been on the  estate for many years past. Mr. ----, of course, altered the distribution  of the work, diminishing the quantity done by the women.    I had a most ludicrous visit this morning from the midwife of the  estate--rather an important personage both to master and slave, as to her  unassisted skill and science the ushering of all the young negroes into  their existence of bondage is entrusted. I heard a great deal of  conversation in the dressing-room adjoining mine, while performing my own  toilet, and presently Mr. ---- opened my room-door, ushering in a dirty  fat good-humoured looking old negress, saying, 'The midwife, Rose, wants  to make your acquaintance.' 'Oh massa!' shrieked out the old creature in a  paroxysm of admiration, 'where you get this lilly alablaster baby!' For a  moment I looked round to see if she was speaking of my baby; but no, my  dear, this superlative apostrophe was elicited by the fairness of _my  skin_--so much for degrees of comparison. Now, I suppose that if I chose  to walk arm in arm with the dingiest mulatto through the streets of  Philadelphia, nobody could possibly tell by my complexion that I was not  his sister, so that the mere quality of mistress must have had a most  miraculous effect upon my skin in the eyes of poor Rose. But this species  of outrageous flattery is as usual with these people as with the low  Irish, and arises from the ignorant desire, common to both the races, of  propitiating at all costs the fellow-creature who is to them as a  Providence--or rather, I should say, a fate--for 't is a heathen and no  Christian relationship. Soon after this visit, I was summoned into the  wooden porch or piazza of the house, to see a poor woman who desired to  speak to me. This was none other than the tall emaciated-looking negress  who, on the day of our arrival, had embraced me and my nurse with such  irresistible zeal. She appeared very ill to-day, and presently unfolded to  me a most distressing history of bodily afflictions. She was the mother of  a very large family, and complained to me that, what with child-bearing  and hard field labour, her back was almost broken in two. With an almost  savage vehemence of gesticulation she suddenly tore up her scanty  clothing, and exhibited a spectacle with which I was inconceivably shocked  and sickened. The facts, without any of her corroborating statements, bore  tolerable witness to the hardships of her existence. I promised to attend  to her ailments and give her proper remedies; but these are natural  results, inevitable and irremediable ones, of improper treatment of the  female frame--and though there may be alleviation, there cannot be any  cure when once the beautiful and wonderful structure has been thus made  the victim of ignorance, folly, and wickedness.    After the departure of this poor woman, I walked down the settlement  towards the infirmary or hospital, calling in at one or two of the houses  along the row. These cabins consist of one room about twelve feet by  fifteen, with a couple of closets smaller and closer than the state-rooms  of a ship, divided off from the main room and each other by rough wooden  partitions in which the inhabitants sleep. They have almost all of them a  rude bedstead, with the grey moss of the forests for mattress, and filthy,  pestilential-looking blankets, for covering. Two families (sometimes eight  and ten in number) reside in one of these huts, which are mere wooden  frames pinned, as it were, to the earth by a brick chimney outside, whose  enormous aperture within pours down a flood of air, but little  counteracted by the miserable spark of fire, which hardly sends an  attenuated thread of lingering smoke up its huge throat. A wide ditch runs  immediately at the back of these dwellings, which is filled and emptied  daily by the tide. Attached to each hovel is a small scrap of ground for a  garden, which, however, is for the most part untended and uncultivated.  Such of these dwellings as I visited to-day were filthy and wretched in  the extreme, and exhibited that most deplorable consequence of ignorance  and an abject condition, the inability of the inhabitants to secure and  improve even such pitiful comfort as might yet be achieved by them.  Instead of the order, neatness, and ingenuity which might convert even  these miserable hovels into tolerable residences, there was the careless,  reckless, filthy indolence which even the brutes do not exhibit in their  lairs and nests, and which seemed incapable of applying to the uses of  existence the few miserable means of comfort yet within their reach.  Firewood and shavings lay littered about the floors, while the half-naked  children were cowering round two or three smouldering cinders. The moss  with which the chinks and crannies of their ill-protecting dwellings might  have been stuffed, was trailing in dirt and dust about the ground, while  the back-door of the huts, opening upon a most unsightly ditch, was left  wide open for the fowls and ducks, which they are allowed to raise, to  travel in and out, increasing the filth of the cabin, by what they brought  and left in every direction. In the midst of the floor, or squatting round  the cold hearth, would be four or five little children from four to ten  years old, the latter"]]]
