No, no! my power is equal to save or to destroy.\" As he uttered these  words he rapidly ascended the rocks which skirted that part of the banks  of the river on which he stood, and was soon lost among the wild woods  that crowned their summit.    We shall not enter into any detailed account of the events of that night.  The royalists, by means of an unexpected attack during the truce, and  aided by internal treachery, hoped to make themselves masters of the city  of Hereford. The citizens, however, had by some unknown means obtained  intelligence of the designs of the enemy, and were prepared to repel their  attacks. Every street was lined with soldiers, and a band of the bravest  and most determined, under the command of Eustace Chandos, (Isabel's  father,) manned the city walls. The struggle was short but sanguinary--the  invaders were beaten back at every point, their best troops were left dead  in the trenches, and above two hundred prisoners (among whom was Sir Hugh  Spenser himself) fell into the hands of the citizens. The successful party  set no bounds either to their exultation or their revenge. The rejoicings  were continued for three successive days; the neighbouring country was  ravaged without cessation and without remorse; and all the prisoners were  ordered, by a message to that effect received from queen Isabella, to be  treated as felons, and hanged in the most public places in the city. This  decree was rigorously and unrelentingly executed. The royalist soldiers,  without any distinction as to rank or character, suffered the ignominious  punishment to which they were condemned, and the streets of Hereford were  blocked up by gibbets, which the most timid and merciful of its  inhabitants gazed upon with satisfaction and triumph.    Sir Hugh Spenser, both on account of his rank and of the peculiar degree  of hatred with which each bosom beat against him, was reserved to be the  last victim. On the day of his execution the streets were lined with  spectators, and the principal families in the city occupied stations round  the scaffold. So great was the universal joy at having their enemy in their  power, that even the wives and daughters of the most distinguished citizens  were anxious to view the punishment inflicted upon him whom they considered  the grand cause of all the national evils. Isabel was not of this number;  but her father sternly compelled her to be a witness of the dismal scene.  The hour of noon was fast approaching, and the bell of the cathedral  heavily and solemnly tolled the knell of the unfortunate Spenser. The fatal  cavalcade approached the place of execution. A stern and solemn triumph  gleamed in the eyes of the soldiers as they trod by the side of the victim;  but most of the spectators, especially the females, were melted into tears  when they beheld the fine manly form of the prisoner, which seemed better  fitted to adorn the royal levee, or a lady's bower, than for the melancholy  fate to which he was about to be consigned. His head was bare, and his  light flaxen hair fell in a rich profusion of locks down his shoulders, but  left unshaded his finely-proportioned and sunburnt features. He wore the  uniform of the royal army, and a star on his breast indicated his rank,  while he held in his hand a small ivory cross, which he frequently and  fervently kissed. His deportment was firm and contemptuous, and, as he  looked on the formal and frequently grotesque figures of his guards, his  features even assumed an expression of risibility. The sight of the gibbet,  however, which was raised fifty feet high, seemed to appal him, for he had  not been apprized of the ignominious nature of his punishment. \"And is  this,\" he said, as he scornfully dashed away a tear which had gathered in  his eye, \"ye rebellious dogs, is this the death to which you doom the heir  of Winchester?\" A stern and bitter smile played on the lips of his guards,  but they remained silent. \"Oh, God!\" he continued, \"in the field, or on the  wave, or on the block, which has reeked so often with the bravest and  noblest blood, I could have died smiling; but this--\" His emotion seemed  increasing, but with a violent effort he suppressed every outward sign of  it; for the visible satisfaction which gleamed on the dark faces around  him, at the state of weakness to which they had reduced the proud heart of  their foe, was more galling to his soul than the shameful death to which he  was devoted.    By the time he reached the place of execution his face had assumed its  calm and scornful air, and he sprang upon the scaffold with apparently  unconcerned alacrity. At the same moment a dreadful shriek issued from that  part of the surrounding booths in which the family of Chandos sat; and in  another instant a female, deadly pale, and with her hair and dress  disordered, had darted on to the scaffold, and clasped the prisoner in her  arms.    \"Walter!\" she cried, \"Walter! can it be thou? oh! they dare not take thy  life; thou bravest, best of men! Avaunt, ye bloodthirsty brood! ye cannot  tear me from him. Not till my arms grow cold in death I'll clasp him thus,  and defy the world to sever us!\"    \"Oh! Isabel!\" he said, \"it is too much; my soul can bear no more. I hoped  thy eyes had been spared this sight--but the cold tyrants have decreed it  thus. On! leave me, leave me!--it is in vain--unmannered ruffians, spare  her!\" While he spoke, the soldiers forcibly tore her from him, and were  dragging her through the crowd.--\"My father! save him! he saved thy  child!--Walter! supplicate him--he is kind.\" She turned her eyes to the  scaffold as she uttered these words, and beheld the form of Spenser  writhing in the air, and convulsed with the last mortal agony. A fearful  shriek burst from her heart, and she sank senseless in the arms of those  who bore her.    Isabel survived this event more than a twelvemonth; but her reason had  fled and her health was so shattered that final recovery was hopeless.  She took scarcely any food, refused all intercourse with her former  friends, and even with her father, and would sit silent and motionless  for days together. One thing only soothed her mind, or afforded her any  gratification; and this, as she was an experienced navigator of the  river, her friends indulged her in--to sail from the city of Hereford to  that spot on which she used to meet her lover. This she did constantly  every evening; but when she landed, and had waited a short time, her  shrieks and cries were pitiable. This practice one evening proved fatal.  Instead of steering to the usual landing-place, a little above the city,  she entered a part of the river where the current is unusually strong.  The rapidity of its waves mastered and overturned the frail bark in which  she sailed, and the unfortunate Isabel sunk to rise no more!    The tragic nature of these events made an impression on the popular mind  which two centuries did not efface. The spirit of Isabel was still said  to sail every night from Hereford to Northbrigg, to meet her lover; and  the beach across the river which this unearthly traveller pursued, was  long distinguished by the name of \"The Spectre's Voyage.\"    _Neele's Romance of History._           *       *       *       *       *      IRISH GRANDEES.      Conspicuous amongst the most conspicuous of the stars; of the ascendant,  was a lady, who took the field with an _eclat_, a brilliancy, and bustle,  which for a time fixed the attention of all upon herself. Although a fine  woman, in the strictest sense of the term, and still handsome, though not  still very young, she was even more distinguished by her air of high  supremacy, than by her beauty. She sat loftily in a lofty phaeton, which  was emblazoned with arms, and covered with coronets; and she played with  her long whip, as ladies of old managed their fans, with grace and  coquetry. She was dressed in a rich habit, whose facings and epaulettes  spoke her the lady of the noble colonel of some provincial corps of  volunteers. A high military cap, surmounted with a plume of black feathers,  well became her bright, bold, black eyes, and her brow that looked as if  accustomed \"to threaten and command.\" The air had deepened her colour  through her rouge, as it had blown from her dark, dishevelled tresses the  mareschal powder, then still worn in Ireland--(the last lingering barbarism  of the British toilette, which France had already abandoned, with other  barbarous modes, and exchanged for the _coiffure d'Arippine_ and the _tete  a la Brutus_.) Her _pose_, her glance, her nod, her smile, all conscious  and careless as they were, proclaimed a privileged autocrat of the Irish  _bon ton_, a \"_dasher_,\" as it was termed, of the first order; for that  species of effrontery called _dashing_ was then in full vogue, as consonant  to a state of society, where all in a certain class went by assumption.    This lady had arrived rather early in the field, for one whose habits were  necessarily on the wrong side of time and of punctuality. She came bowling  along, keeping up her fiery steeds to a sort of curvetting gallop, like one  deep in the science of the _manege_--now deranging the order of march of  the troops, by breaking through the ranks, in spite of the impertinent  remonstrances of the out-posts and videttes, at which she laughed, at once  to show her teeth and her power;--and now scattering the humble crowd,  \"like chaff before the wind,\" as giving her horses the rein, she permitted  them to plunge head-long on, while skilfully flourishing her long whip, she  made on every side a preliminary clearance. Many among the multitude  announced her as the famous Kitty Cut-dash, and nodded knowingly as she  passed them; but the greater number detected in the beautiful charioteer,  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11408"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 12, No. 346, (#5)"],[1,"of a grain, killed a rose  branch and flower in forty--eight hours.--    _Quar. Jour. of Agriculture._           *       *       *       *       *        NOTES OF A READER             *       *       *       *       *      KNOWING PEOPLE.      How happily do these few lines characterize a certain set of people who  pick up news from \"good authority,\" and settle the fate of the nation  over strong potations of brandy and water, or Calvert's porter,  forgetting that \"people who drink beer, think beer.\" Suppose a question  of great public interest afloat:--\"Reports are abroad, precisely of the  proper pitch of absurdity, for the greedy swallowing of the great  grey-goggle-eyed public, who may be seen standing with her mouth wide  open like a crocodile, with her hands in her breeches-pockets, at the  crosses of cities on market-days, gluttonously devouring whatever rumour  flings into her maw--nor in the least aware that she is all the time  eating wind. People of smallish abilities begin to look wiser and wiser  every day--their nods seem more significant--in the shaking of their  heads there is more of Burleigh--and in short sentences--that sound like  apophthegms--they are apt to impose themselves on their credulous selves  as so many Solomons.\"           *       *       *       *       *      NEW CHURCHES.      Among the numerous sermons lately preached in pursuance of the King's  letter for the enlargement and building of churches and chapels, we  notice one by the vicar of Dorking, in Surrey, from which we extract the  following:--\"In many places of this country it is lamentable to behold  the ruinous state of churches. If a man's dwelling-house be decayed, he  will never cease till it be restored; if his barn, where he bestows all  his fruits and his goods, be out of repair, what diligence doth he use  to make it perfect? If the stable for his horse, or the sty for his  swine, be not able to exclude the severity of weather, when the rains  fall, and the winds blow, how careful is he to incur the necessary cost?  Shall we then be so mindful of our common houses, deputed to such low  occupations, and be forgetful toward that house of God, in which are  expounded the words of our eternal salvation--in which are administered  the sacraments and mysteries of our redemption?\"--The persuasiveness of  this argument is admirable, and its amiable tone and temper are  infinitely more suitable than the florid appeal.    We also learn that Parliament has already voted a million and a half of  money to the sole use of building churches, and that in the diocese in  which Dorking is situated, thirty-two cases have been aided by the sum  of 6,230_l_.    But the _church of Dorking_ is in a dilapidated state, and is capable of  containing only one-fifth of the inhabitants. It was \"probably erected  about the commencement of the twelfth century; and the crumbling walls  may almost be said to totter under the massive roof.\" This calls forth  the following pious exhortation: \"Our lot is cast in a pleasant place.  Let us manifest our thankfulness to the Giver of every good gift by a  structure dedicated to his service, corresponding with the magnificence  of private mansions, and the natural beauties of local scenery.\" We can  only wonder that, in a neighbourhood abounding with men of rank and  opulence, such an appeal is necessary.           *       *       *       *       *      SHORT-HAND.      \"Sound is the gauge of short-hand, and connexion the master-key for  deciphering.\" Such is one of the axioms in Mr. Harding's eighth edition  of his very valuable little \"System of Short-Hand,\"--to which, by way of  pleasant illustration, he appends, the \"Dirge on Miss LN G,\" copied by  us from the \"New Monthly Magazine;\" but we give Mr. H. credit for the  present application. We could write a whole number of the MIRROR on the  advantages of short-hand to the community; but as that would not be a  practical illustration, we desist. Only think of the \"Times\" newspaper  being scores of miles from town before half London has risen; and the  Duke of Bedford, reading the previous night's debates at his breakfast  table at Woburn Abbey. What would all Mr. Applegath's machinery do  towards producing the newspaper without the aid of short-hand, which  makes its expedition second only to thought. Half an hour's delay of  \"the paper\" makes us fret and fume and condemn the fair provider of our  breakfast--for over-roasted coffee and stale eggs--all because the paper  is not \"come;\" but when would it come without short-hand? why at  dinner-time, and that would make short work of a day--for thousands  cannot set to work till they have consulted it as a mainspring of  action. People who aim at the short cuts to knowledge should study  stenography, and for this purpose they will do well to provide  themselves with Mr. Harding's System, which will be as good as \"a cubit  to a man's height.\"           *       *       *       *       *      LOVE'S MASTERY.        She was his own, his all:--the crowd may prove    A transient feeling, and misname it love:--    His was a higher impulse; 'twas a part    Of the warm blood that circled through his heart,    A fervid energy, a spell that bound    Thoughts, wishes, feelings, in one hallow'd round.                             _The Winter's Wreath._           *       *       *       *       *      CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.      The second edition of a pamphlet, entitled the Voice of Humanity, has  just reached us. It contains details of the disgusting cruelties of the  metropolis--as bear and badger baiting, dog-fighting, slaughtering-  horses, &c.--and reference to the _abattoirs_, or improved  slaughter-houses for cattle, which was illustrated in our 296th Number.  In the appendix are many interesting particulars of Smithfield Market  and similar nuisances. The pamphlet is dedicated to that enlightened  friend of humanity, Sir James Mackintosh, and it appears worthy of his  patronage.           *       *       *       *       *      WOMANKIND.

There are few of our readers who need to be informed that Captain Rock's  Letters to the King are certainly not written by Mr. Moore, to whom,  while the publication was suspended, they were so positively  ascribed.--_Q. Rev._           *       *       *       *       *      THE LIBRARY AT HOLKHAM.      The manuscripts of Lord Coke are in the possession of his descendant,  Mr. Coke, of Norfolk, his representative through the female issue of  Lord Leicester, the male heir of the chief justice. At this gentleman's  princely mansion of Holkham, is one of the finest collections, or,  indeed, libraries of manuscripts anywhere preserved; certainly the  finest in any private individual's possession. It partly consists of the  chief justice's papers; the rest, and the bulk of it, was collected by  that accomplished nobleman who built the mansion, the last male heir of  the great lawyer. He had spent many years abroad, where his taste was  improved and his general education perfected. He collected a vast number  of the most valuable manuscripts. Of these the exquisitely illuminated  missals, and other writings of a similar description, which would from  their perfect beauty and great rarity bear the highest price in the  market, are certainly by far the least precious in the eyes of literary  men. Many of the finest _codices_ of the Greek, Latin, and old Italian  classics are to be found in this superb collection. Among others are no  less than thirteen of Livy, a favourite author of Lord Leicester, whom  he had made some progress in editing, when he learnt that  Drakenborchius, the well known German critic, had proceeded further in  the same task, and generously handed over to him the treasures of his  library. The excellent edition of that commentator makes constant  reference to the Holkham manuscripts, under the name of _MSS.  Lovelliana_, from the title of Lovell; Lord Leicester not having then  been promoted to the earldom. Mr. Coke, with a becoming respect for the  valuable collection of his ancestors, was desirous to have the  manuscripts unfolded, bound, and arranged, both with a view to their  preservation and to the facility of consulting them. They had lain for  half a century neglected, and in part verging towards decay, when he  engaged his valued friend, William Roscoe, to undertake the labour so  congenial to his taste and habits, of securing these treasures from the  ravages of time. From the great number of the manuscripts, the state in  which many of them were, and the distance of Mr. Roscoe's residence,  this was necessarily a work of time. After above ten years employed on  it, the task is now"]]]
