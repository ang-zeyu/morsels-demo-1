Nevertheless, Verrazano's voyage developed into the French  colonization of Canada, just as Cabot drew the British to  Newfoundland, Columbus the Spaniards to Central and South America, and  Amerigo Vespucci showed the Portuguese the way to Brazil. The modern  nations of western Europe owe the inception of their great colonies in  America to four Italians.          CHAPTER II    Jacques Cartier      Verrazano and Gomez, and probably the English captain, John Rut, had  all sought for the opening of a strait of salt water--like Magellan's  Straits in the far south--which should lead them through the great  North-American continent to the regions of China and Japan. Yet in  some incomprehensible way they overlooked the two broad passages to  the north and south of Newfoundland--the Straits of Belle Isle and of  Cabot--which would at any rate lead them into the vast Gulf of St.  Lawrence, and thence to the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes; a  natural system of waterways connected each with the other and all with  the Mississippi and Missouri, the Arctic Ocean, and Hudson's Bay; nay,  more, with the North Pacific also; so that with a few \"portages\", or  carryings of canoes from one watershed to another, a traveller of any  enterprise, accompanied by a sturdy crew, can cross the broad  continent of North America at its broadest from sea to sea without  much walking.    Estevao Gomez noticed Cabot Straits between Cape Breton and  Newfoundland, but thought them only a very deep bay. John Rut and  others discerned the Straits of Belle Isle as a wide recess in the  coast rather than the mouth of a channel leading far inland. And yet,  after thirty years of Breton, English, and Portuguese fishing  operations in these waters, there must have been glimmerings of the  existence of the great Gulf of St. Lawrence behind Newfoundland: and  JACQUES CARTIER (or Quartier), who had probably made already one  voyage to Newfoundland (besides a visit to Brazil), suspected that  between Newfoundland and Labrador there lay the opening of the great  sea passage \"leading to China\". He proposed himself to Philippe de  Chabot, the Admiral of France, as the leader of a new French adventure  to find the North-west Passage, was accepted by King Francis, and at  the age of forty-three years set out, with two ships, from St. Malo in  Brittany, on April 20, 1534, ten years after Verrazano's voyage, and  reached the coast of Newfoundland after a voyage of only twenty days.  As he sailed northwards, past the deeply indented fiords and bays of  eastern Newfoundland (the shores of which were still hugged by the  winter ice), he and his men were much impressed with the incredible  numbers of the sea fowl settled for nesting purposes on the rocky  islands, especially on Funk Island.[1] These birds were guillemots,  puffins, great auks,[2] gannets (called by Cartier _margaulx_), and  probably gulls and eider duck. To his sailors--always hungry and  partly fed on salted provisions, as seamen were down to a few years  ago--this inexhaustible supply of fresh food was a source of great  enjoyment. They were indifferent, no doubt, to the fishy flavour of  the auks and the guillemots, and only noticed that they were  splendidly fat. Moreover, the birds attracted Polar bears \"as large as  cows and as white as swans\". The bears would swim off from the shore  to the islands (unless they could reach them by crossing the ice), and  the sailors occasionally killed the bears and ate their flesh, which  they compared in excellence and taste to veal.    [Footnote 1: Funk Island--called by Cartier \"the Island of Birds\"--is  only about 3 miles round, and 46 feet above the sea level. It is 3  miles distant from the coast.]    [Footnote 2: The Great Auk (_Alca impennis_), extinct since about 1844  in Europe and 1870 in Labrador, once had in ancient times a  geographical range from Massachusetts and Newfoundland to Iceland,  Ireland, Scotland, N.E. England, and Denmark. Perhaps nowhere was it  found so abundantly as on the coasts of Eastern Newfoundland and on  Funk Island hard by. The Great Auk was in such numbers on the  north-east coast of Newfoundland that the Amerindians of that country  and of southern Labrador used it as fuel in the winter time, its body  being very full of oil and burning with a splendid flame. The French  seamen called it _pingouin_ (\"penguin\") from its fatness, and this  name was much later transferred to the real penguins of the southern  seas which are quite unrelated to the auks.]    Passing through the Straits of Belle Isle, Cartier's ships entered  the Gulf of St. Lawrence. They had previously visited the adjoining  coast of Labrador, and there had encountered their first \"natives\",  members of some Algonkin tribe from Canada, who had come north for  seal fishing (Cartier is clever enough to notice and describe their  birch-bark canoes). After examining the west coast of Newfoundland,  Cartier's ships sailed on past the Magdalen Islands (stopping every  now and then off some islet to collect supplies of sea birds, for the  rocky ground was covered with them as thickly as a meadow with  grass).[3] He reached the north coast of Prince Edward Island, and  this lovely country received from him an enthusiastic description. The  pine trees, the junipers, yews, elms, poplars, ash, and willows, the  beeches and the maples, made the forest not only full of delicious and  stimulating odours, but lovely in its varied tints of green. In the  natural meadows and forest clearings there were red and white  currants, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, a vetch which  produced edible peas, and a grass with a grain like rye. The forest  abounded in pigeons, and the climate was pleasant and warm.    [Footnote 3: On the shores of these islands they noticed \"several  great beasts like oxen, which have two tusks in the mouth similar to  those of the elephant\". These were walruses.]    Later on he coasted New Brunswick, and paused for a time over Chaleur  Bay, hoping it might be the opening to the strait across the continent  of which he was in search; but finding it was not, he continued  northwards till he had almost rounded the Gaspe Peninsula, a course  which would have led him straight away into the wonderful discovery of  the St. Lawrence River, but that, being forced by bad weather into  Gaspe Bay, and perhaps hindered by fog, instead of entering the St.  Lawrence he sailed right across to Anticosti Island. After that,  being baffled by bad weather and doubtful as to his resources lasting  out, he decided to return to France through the Strait of Belle Isle.    So far he had failed to realize two of the most important things in  the geography of this region: the broad southern entrance into the  Gulf of St. Lawrence (subsequently called Cabot Strait), which  separates Newfoundland on the north from Cape Breton Island on the  south, and the broad entrance into the River St. Lawrence between  Anticosti Island and the Gaspe Peninsula.    Yet, whilst staying in Gaspe Bay, he had a very important meeting with  Amerindian natives of the Huron-Iroquois stock, who had come down the  River St. Lawrence from the neighbourhood of Quebec, fishing for  mackerel. These bold, friendly people welcomed the French heartily,  greeting them with songs and dances. But when they saw Cartier erect a  great cross on the land at the entrance to Gaspe Bay (a cross bearing  a shield with the arms of France and the letters \"Vive le Roi de  France\"), they were ill at ease. It is certain that not one word could  be understood in language between the two parties, for there were as  yet no interpreters; but the Amerindians were probably shrewd enough  to perceive that Cartier was making some claim on the land, and they  explained by signs that they considered all this country belonged to  themselves. Nevertheless, Cartier persuaded two youths, the sons of  one of the chiefs, to go back with him to France on his ship, to learn  the French language, to see what France looked like, and to return  afterwards as interpreters. The boys, though they were practically  kidnapped at first, were soon reconciled to going, especially when  they were dressed in French clothes!    [Illustration: JACQUES CARTIER]    When Cartier was on his way home he sailed in a north-easterly  direction in such a way as to overlook the broad channel between the  Gaspe Peninsula and Anticosti Island, but having rounded the  easternmost extremity of that large island, he coasted along its  northern shores until he caught sight of the opening of the Canadian  channel to the west. He believed then that he had discovered the  long-looked-for opening of the trans-continental passage, and sailed  for France with his wonderful news.    On the 19th of May, 1535, Cartier started again from St. Malo with  three ships, the biggest of which was only 120 tons, while the others  were respectively 60 and 40 tons capacity. The crew consisted of about  112 persons, and in addition there were the two Indian youths who had  been kidnapped on the previous voyage, and were now returning as  interpreters. Instead, however, of reaching Newfoundland in twenty  days, he spent five weeks crossing the Atlantic before he reached his  rendezvous with the other ships at Blanc Sablon, on the south coast of  Labrador; for the easy access to the Gulf of St. Lawrence through  Cabot Strait (between Newfoundland and Cape Breton) was not yet  realized. Once past Anticosti Island, the two Huron interpreters began  to recognize the scenery.[4] They now explained to Cartier that he had  entered the estuary of a vast river. This they said he had only to  pursue in ships and boats and he would reach \"Canada\" (which was the  name they gave to the district round about Quebec), and that beyond  \"Canada\" no man had ever been known to reach the end "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13007"],[0,"The Edda, Volume 1 (#5)"],[1,"protector of men, the only slayer of the Serpent, baited his hook  with the ox's head. The God-hated one who girds all lands from below  swallowed the bait. Doughtily pulled mighty Thor the poison-streaked  serpent up to the side; he struck down with his hammer the hideous  head of the wolf's companion. The monster roared, the wilderness  resounded, the old earth shuddered all through. The fish sank back  into the sea. Gloomy was the giant when they rowed back, so that he  spoke not a word.\"    There is nothing to suggest that Joermungandr, to whom the word  World-Snake (Midgardsorm) always refers in the Edda, is the same as  Nidhoegg, the serpent that gnaws at Yggdrasil's roots; but both are  relics of Snake-worship.           *       *       *       *       *    _The World-Ash_, generally called Yggdrasil's Ash, is one of the most  interesting survivals of tree-worship. It is described by the Sibyl  in _Voeluspa_: \"I know an ash called Yggdrasil, a high tree sprinkled  with white moisture (thence come the dews that fall in the dales):  it stands ever-green by Urd's spring. Thence come three maids,  all-knowing, from the hall that stands under the tree\"; and as a  sign of the approaching doom she says: \"Yggdrasil's ash trembles as  it stands; the old tree groans.\" _Grimnismal_ says that the Gods go  every day to hold judgment by the ash, and describes it further:    \"Three roots lie three ways under Yggdrasil's ash: Hel dwells under  one, the frost-giants under the second, mortal men under the third. The  squirrel is called Ratatosk who shall run over Yggdrasil's ash;  he shall carry down the eagle's words, and tell them to Nidhoegg  below. There are four harts, with necks thrown back, who gnaw  off the shoots.... More serpents lie under Yggdrasil's ash than  any one knows. Ofni and Svafni I know will ever gnaw at the tree's  twigs. Yggdrasil's ash suffers more hardships than men know: the hart  bites above, the side decays, and Nidhoegg gnaws below.... Yggdrasil's  ash is the best of trees.\"    The snake and the tree are familiar in other mythologies, though in  most other cases the snake is the protector, while here he is the  destroyer. Both Nidhoegg and Joermungandr are examples of the destroying  dragon rather than the treasure-guardian. The Ash is the oracle: the  judgment-place of the Gods, the dwelling of the Fates, the source of  the spring of knowledge.           *       *       *       *       *    _Ragnaroek_.--The Twilight of the Gods (or Doom of the Gods) is the  central point of the Viking religion. The Regin (of which _Ragna_  is genitive plural) are the ruling powers, often called Ginnregin  (the great Gods), Uppregin (the high Gods), Thrymregin (the warrior  Gods). The word is commonly used of the Aesir in _Voeluspa_; in  _Alvissmal_ the Regin seem to be distinguished from both Aesir and  Vanir. The whole story of the Aesir is overshadowed by knowledge of  this coming doom, the time when they shall meet foes more terrible  than the giants, and fall before them; their constant effort is to  learn what will happen then, and to gather their forces together  to meet it. The coming Ragnaroek is the reason for the existence of  Valhalla with its hosts of slain warriors; and of all the Gods, Odin,  Thor, Tyr and Loki are most closely connected with it. Two poems of  the verse Edda describe it:    (1) _Vafthrudnismal_:    V. \"What is the plain called where Surt and the blessed Gods shall  meet in battle?\"    O. \"Vigrid is the name of the place where Surt and the blessed Gods  shall meet in battle. It is a hundred miles every way; it is their  destined battle-field.\"           *       *       *       *       *    O. \"Whence shall the sun come on the smooth heaven when Fenri has  destroyed this one?\"    V. \"Before Fenri destroy her, the elf-beam shall bear a daughter:  that maid shall ride along her mother's paths, when the Gods perish.\"    O. \"Which of the Aesir shall rule over the realms of the Gods, when  Surt's fire is quenched?\"    V. \"Vidar and Vali shall dwell in the sanctuary of the Gods when  Surt's fire is quenched. Modi and Magni shall have Mjoellni at the  end of Vingni's (_i.e._, Thor's) combat.\"    O. \"What shall be Odin's end, when the Gods perish?\"    V. \"The Wolf will swallow the father of men; Vidar will avenge it. He  will cleave the Wolf's cold jaws in the battle.\"    (2) _Voeluspa_:    \"A hag sits eastward in Ironwood and rears Fenri's children; one of  them all, in troll's shape, shall be the sun's destroyer. He shall  feed on the lives of death-doomed men; with red blood he shall redden  the seat of the Gods. The sunshine shall grow black, all winds will  be unfriendly in the after-summers.... I see further in the future  the great Ragnaroek of the Gods of Victory.... Heimdal blows loudly,  the horn is on high; Yggdrasil's ash trembles as it stands, the old  tree groans.\"    The following lines tell of the fire-giants and the various combats,  and the last section of the poem deals with a new world when Baldr,  Hoed and Hoeni are to come back to the dwelling-place of the Gods.    The whole points to a belief in the early destruction of the world  and the passing away of the old order of things. Whether the new  world which _Vafthrudnismal_ and _Voeluspa_ both prophesy belongs to  the original idea or not is a disputed point. Probably it does not;  at all events, none of the old Aesir, according to the poems, are  to survive, for Modi and Magni are not really Gods at all, Baldr,  Hoed and Vali belong to another myth, Hoeni had passed out of the  hierarchy by his exchange with Njoerd, and Vidar's origin is obscure.           *       *       *       *       *    _The Einherjar_, the great champions or chosen warriors, are intimately  connected with Ragnaroek. All warriors who fall in battle are taken  to Odin's hall of the slain, Valhalla. According to _Grimnismal_,  he \"chooses every day men dead by the sword\"; his Valkyries ride  to battle to give the victory and bring in the fallen. Hence Odin  is the giver of victory. Loki in _Lokasenna_ taunts him with giving  victory to the wrong side: \"Thou hast never known how to decide the  battle among men. Thou hast often given victory to those to whom thou  shouldst not give it, to the more cowardly\"; this, no doubt, was in  order to secure the best fighters for Valhalla. That the defeated  side sometimes consoled themselves with this explanation of a notable  warrior's fall is proved by the tenth-century dirge on Eirik Bloodaxe,  where Sigmund the Volsung asks in Valhalla: \"Why didst thou take the  victory from him, if thou thoughtest him brave?\" and Odin replies:  \"Because it is uncertain when the grey Wolf will come to the seat  of the Gods.\" There are similar lines in Eyvind's dirge on Hakon  the Good. In this way a host was collected ready for Ragnaroek:  for _Grimnismal_  says: \"There are five hundred doors and eighty  in Valhalla; eight hundred Einherjar will go out from each door,  when they go to fight the wolf.\" Meanwhile they fight and feast:  \"All the Einherjar in Odin's courts fight every day: they choose  the slain and ride from the battle, and sit then in peace together\"  (_Vafthrudnismal_,) and the Valkyries bear ale to them _(Grimnismal_).    It is often too hastily assumed that the Norse Ragnaroek with  the dependant Valhalla system are in great part the outcome of  Christian influence: of an imitation of the Christian Judgment Day  and the Christian heaven respectively. Owing to the lateness of our  material, it is, of course, impossible to decide how old the beliefs  may be, but it is likely that the Valhalla idea only took form at  the systematising of the mythology in the Viking age. The belief  in another world for the dead is, however, by no means exclusively  Christian, and a reference in _Grimnismal_ suggests the older system  out of which, under the influence of the Ragnaroek idea, Valhalla was  developed. The lines, \"The ninth hall is Folkvang, where Freyja rules  the ordering of seats in the hall; half the slain she chooses every  day, Odin has the other half,\" are an evident survival of a belief  that all the dead went to live with the Gods, Odin having the men,  and Freyja (or more probably Frigg) the women; the idea being here  confused with the later system, under which only those who fell in  battle were chosen by the Gods. Christian colouring appears in the  last lines of _Voeluspa_ and in Snorri, where men are divided into the  \"good and moral,\" who go after death to a hall of red gold, and the  \"perjurers and murderers,\" who are sent to a hall of snakes.    For Ragnaroek also a heathen origin is at least as probable as a  Christian one. I would suggest as a possibility that the expectation of  the Twilight of the Gods may have grown out of some ritual connected  with the eclipse, such as is frequent among heathen races. Such  ceremonies are a tacit acknowledgment of a doubt, and if they ever  existed among the Scandinavians, the possibility, ever present to  the savage mind, of a time when his efforts to help the light might  be fruitless, and the darkness prove the stronger, would be the germ  of his more civilised descendant's belief in Ragnaroek.    By turning to the surviving poems of the Skalds, whose dates can be  approximately reckoned from the sagas, we can fix an inferior limit  for certain of the legends given above, placing them definitely in the  heathen time. Reference has already been made to the corroboration  of the Valhalla belief supplied by the elegies on Eirik Bloodaxe  and Hakon the Good. In the former (which is anonymous, but must have  been written soon after 950, since it was composed, on Eirik's death,  by his wife's orders), Odin commands the Einherjar and Valkyries to  prepare for the reception of the slain Eirik and his host, since no  one knows how soon the Gods will need to gather their forces together  for the great contest.
