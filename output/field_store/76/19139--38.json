The Women were too Flushed and Proud to Notice.    At 8:30 P.M. the Lady President stood out and began to read a few Pink  Thoughts on \"Woman's Destiny--Why Not?\" Along toward 9:15, about the  time the Lady President was beginning to show up Good and Earnest,  Josephine Beadle, who was Circulating around on the Outskirts of the  Throng to make sure that everybody was Happy, made a Discovery. She  noticed that the Men standing along the Wall and in the Doorways were  not more than sixty per cent En Rapport with the Long Piece about  Woman's Destiny. Now Josephine was right there to see that Everybody had  a Nice Time, and she did not like to see the Prominent Business Men of  the Town dying of Thirst or Leg Cramp or anything like that, so she gave  two or three of them the Quiet Wink, and they tiptoed after her out to  the Dining Room, where she offered Refreshments, and said they could  slip out on the Side Porch and Smoke if they wanted to.    [Illustration: LADY PRESIDENT]    Probably they preferred to go back in the Front Room and hear some more  about Woman's Destiny not.    As soon as they could master their Emotions and get control of their  Voices, they told Josephine what they thought of her. They said she made  the Good Samaritan look like a Cheap Criminal, and if she would only say  the Word they would begin to put Ground Glass into the Food at Home.  Then Josephine called them \"Boys,\" which probably does not make a Hit  with one who is on the sloping side of 48. More of the Men seemed to  awake to the Fact that they were Overlooking something, so they came on  the Velvet Foot back to the Dining Room and declared themselves In, and  flocked around Josephine and called her \"Josie\" and \"Joe.\" They didn't  care. They were having a Pleasant Visit.    Josephine gave them Allopathic Slugs of the Size that they feed you in  the Navy and then lower you into the Dingey and send you Ashore. Then  she let them go out on the Porch to smoke. By the time the Lady  President came to the last Page there were only two Men left in the  Front Room. One was Asleep and the other was Penned In.    The Women were Huffy. They went out to make the Men come in, and found  them Bunched on the Porch listening to a Story that a Traveling Man had  just brought to Town that Day.    Now the Plan was that during the Reception the Company would stand about  in little Groups, and ask each other what Books they liked, and make it  something on the order of a Salon. This Plan miscarried, because all the  Men wanted to hear Rag Time played by Josephine, the Life-Saver.  Josephine had to yield, and the Men all clustered around her to give  their Moral Support. After one or two Selections, they felt sufficiently  Keyed to begin to hit up those low-down Songs about Baby and Chickens  and Razors. No one paid any Attention to the Lady President, who was off  in a Corner holding an Indignation Meeting with the Secretary and the  Vice-President.    When the Women began to sort out the Men and order them to start Home  and all the Officers of the Club were giving Josephine the frosty Good  Night, any one could see that there was Trouble ahead.    Next Day the Club held a Special Session and expelled Josephine for  Conduct Unbecoming a Member, and Josephine sent Word to them as follows:  \"Rats.\"    Then the Men quietly got together and bought Josephine about a Thousand  Dollars' Worth of American Beauty Roses to show that they were With her,  and then Homes began to break up, and somebody started the Report that  anyway it was the Lady President's Fault for having such a long and  pokey Essay that wasn't hers at all, but had been Copied out of a Club  Paper published in Detroit.    Before the next Meeting there were two Factions. The Lady President had  gone to a Rest Cure, and the Meeting resolved itself into a Good Cry and  a general Smash-Up.    MORAL: _The only Literary Men are those who have to Work at it._          _THE_ FABLE _OF_ WHY ESSIE'S TALL FRIEND GOT _THE_ FRESH AIR      The Owner of a Furnishing Store gave employment to a Boy with Dreamy  Eyes, who took good care of his Nails and used Scented Soap and carried  a Pocket Looking-Glass. It was his Delight to stand in the Doorway and  watch the Girls all Color Up when they caught Sight of him. He was said  to be a Divine Waltzer at these Balls that cost the Gents 50 cents each  and the Ladies get in free.    There was a Girl named Essie who was Hanging Around the Front of the  Store about half of the Time, waiting to get a Chance to Speak to Bert.  She Chewed Gum and kept her Sailor Hat pulled down to her Eyebrows and  had her Name worked out in Wire and used it as a Breastpin. After she  had waited an Hour or so, and he had Broken Away long enough to take her  aside, she would want to know what it was that Net had said about her,  or else she would ask why he had not Answered her Note. It was always  just about as Momentous as that.    If Essie did not come, she sent some one with a Message, and sometimes  other Floor Managers with Red Neckties and Forelocks would come in to  see about the Arrangements for the next Grand Hop by the Eucalyptus  Pleasure Club.    [Illustration: ESSIE]    Bert was so Engrossed with his Love Affairs and the Pleasure Club and  the Bundle of Correspondence that he carried with him that he had little  Time for Furnishing Goods. It used to Annoy him considerably when any  one came in and wanted to Spend Money. He would set out the Goods in a  Manner that showed it to be something of a Come-Down for him to be  compelled to Wait on Outsiders. While the Customer would be asking  Questions, Bert would be working the Flexible Neck to see if Essie was  still waiting for him. Sometimes when there was a Rush he would get real  Cross, and if People did not Buy in a Hurry he would slam the Boxes  around and be Lippy and give them the Eye. Yet he wondered why he did  not get a Raise in Salary.    During the Holiday Season, when the Eucalyptus Pleasure Club was simply  in a Delirium of All-Night Dances and Fried-Oyster Suppers, and when  Essie had worn a Path in the Snow coming down to tell Bert not to  Forget, the Proprietor decided that the Boy's Job was interfering with  his Gaiety. So when Bert came to get his Envelope the Furnisher told him  he needed more Outdoor Life and Exercise, and he had better find it by  moving around Town and looking for another Job.    MORAL: _Omit the Essie Proposition_.          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ MICHIGAN COUNTERFEIT WHO WASN'T ONE THING _OR THE_  OTHER      Two Travelers sat in a Sleeping Car that was fixed up with Plush and  Curly-Cues until it resembled a Chambermaid's Dream of Paradise. They  were talking about the Man who sat across the Aisle.    \"I think he is an Englishman,\" said the First Traveler.    \"Why do you think so?\" queried his Companion.    \"Well, in the first place his Clothes don't fit him,\" replied the First  Traveler. \"I observe, also, that he has piled all his Luggage on Another  Man's Seat, that he has opened several Windows without asking  Permission, that he has expected the Porter to pay Attention to him and  nobody else, and that he has Kicked at something every Thirty Seconds  since we left Buffalo.\"    \"You make out a Strong Case,\" said the Second Traveler, nodding. \"I will  admit that the Suit is Fierce. Still, I maintain that he is not an  Englishman. I notice that he seems somewhat Ashamed of his Clothes. Now,  if he were an Englishman, he would Glory in the Misfit.\"    \"Perhaps he is a Canadian,\" suggested the First Traveler.    \"Impossible,\" said the other. \"He may be English, but he is not  sufficiently British to be a Canadian. If he were a Canadian he would  now be singing 'Britannia Rules the Wave!' No, I insist that he is an  American traveling Incog. I suspect that I have Caught him with the  Goods. While sitting here, I have had my Sherlock Holmes System at work.  A few Moments ago he read a Joke in a Comic Paper, and the Light of  Appreciation kindled in his Eye before a full Minute had elapsed.\"    [Illustration: PULLMAN CAR]    \"Perhaps it was not a Comic Paper at all,\" said the First Traveler. \"It  may have been Punch. Very often an Englishman will Get Next almost  immediately if the Explanation is put in Parenthesis. You have to Hand  it to him with a Diagram and a Map and then give him a little Time, and  then he Drops. This man is certainly an Englishman. Notice the  Expression of Disapproval. He does not fancy our Farm Scenery. Get onto  the Shoes, too. They are shaped like Muffins. Then if you are still in  Doubt, pay attention to the Accent. Didn't you hear him just now when he  was complaining to the Porter because the Sun was on the wrong side of  the Car?\"    \"Yes, but did you hear him use 'Cahn't' and 'Glass' both in the same  Sentence? When a Man Plays it Both Ways, it is a Sign that he was born  in Wisconsin and attended Harvard. I am convinced that he is not an  Englishman at all. He is probably an American who takes a Bahth in a  Bath-Tub.\"    But the First Traveler persisted that surely the Man across the aisle  was an Englishman, so they Jawed back and forth and finally made a Bet.  Then the First Traveler stepped over and begged the Stranger's Pardon  and asked him, as a personal favor, to Identify himself. Was he an  Englishman or an American?    \"Really, that is a Hard Question to answer,\" said the Surprised  Stranger. \"I confess with some Mortification that Father was an  American, but he wore Detachable Cuffs and talked about Live Stock at  the Table, so the Heirs are trying to Forget him. As nearly as we can  learn, one of my Ancestors came to this Country from Yorkshire early in  the Eighteenth Century and founded a Tannery in Massachusetts, so I feel  that I can claim an English Birthright, regardless of the intervening  Ancestors.

V. Karmu and Dharmu.    There were once two brothers Karmu and Dharmu. Karmu was a farmer and  Dharmu was a trader; once when Dharmu was away from home Karmu gave  a religious feast and did not invite Dharmu's household; when Dharmu  returned and learnt this, he told his wife that he also would perform  the ceremonies in his house, so they set to work and were employed  in cooking rice and vegetables far into the night; and Karam Gosain  came down to see what preparations Dharmu was making in his honour,  and he watched from the back of the house.    Just then Dharmu strained off the water from the cooked rice and threw  it out of the window, and it fell on Karam Gosain and scalded him, and  as the flies and insects worried the wound, Karam Gosain went off to  the Ganges and buried himself in the middle of the stream. As he had  thus offended Karam Gosain, all Dharmu's undertakings failed and he  fell into deep poverty, and had not even enough to eat, so he had to  take service with his brother Karmu. When the time for transplanting  the rice came, Dharmu used to plough and dig the ditches and mend the  gaps along with the day labourers. Karmu told him not to work himself  but act as overseer of the other labourers, and the labourers also told  him that it was not suitable for him to work as a labourer himself,  but Dharmu said that he must earn his wages and insisted on working;  and in the same way Dharmu's wife might have acted as overseer of  the women, but she was ashamed not to work too.    One day they were transplanting the rice and Karmu brought out  breakfast for the labourers; he told Dharmu and his wife to wash their  hands and come and eat; but they answered that they belonged to the  household and that the hired labourers should be fed first, so the  labourers ate and they ate up all the rice and there was nothing left  for Dharmu and his wife. When the midday meal was brought the same  thing happened, Dharmu and his wife got nothing; but they hoped that  it would be made up to them when the wages were paid, and worked  on fasting. At evening when they came to pay the wages in kind,  Dharmu's name was called out first, but he told his brother to pay  the labourers first, and in doing this the paddy was all used up and  there was nothing left for Dharmu and his wife; so they went home  sorrowfully and their children cried for food and they had nothing  to give them. In the night Dharmu's wife said \"They promised to pay  us for merely looking after the work and instead, we worked hard  and have still got nothing. We will not work for them anymore; come,  let us undo the work we did to-day, you cut down the embankments you  repaired, and I will uproot the seedlings which I planted.\" So they  went out into the night to do this. But whenever Dharmu raised his  spade a voice called out \"Hold, hold!\" And whenever his wife put out  her hand to pull up the rice a voice called out \"Hold, hold!\" Then they  said \"Who are you who stop us?\" And the voice answered \"You have done  evil and offended Karam Gosain by scalding him; this is why you have  become poor and to-day have worked without food and without wages;  he has gone to the Ganges and you must go and propitiate him.\" And  they asked how they should propitiate him, and the voice said \"Grind  turmeric and put it on a plate, and buy new cloth and dye it with  turmeric and make ready oil and take these things to the Ganges and  call on Karam Gosain.\" And they believed the voice and the next day  did as it commanded, and set off, leaving their children in charge  of Karmu. On the way they came to a fig-tree full of figs and they  went to eat the fruit; but when they got near they found that all  the figs were full of grubs, and they sang:--          \"Exhausted by hunger we came to a fig-tree,      And found it full of grubs,      O Karam Gosain, how far off are you?\"      Then they came to a mango tree and the same thing happened. And they  went on and saw a cow with a calf; and they thought that they would  milk the cow and drink the milk, but when they went to catch it it  ran away from them and would not let itself be caught; and they sang:--          \"We go to catch the cow and it runs away,      We go to catch the calf and it runs away,      O Karam Gosain how far off are you?\"      But the cow said to them--\"Go to the banks of the Ganges.\" Then  they came to a buffalo and went to milk it, but it lowered its head  and charged them; and Dharam cried but his wife said \"Don't cry\"  and sang:--          \"If you go to catch the buffalo, Dharmu,      It will kill you.      How shall we drink milk? How shall we drink milk?      How far off are you, O our Karam Gosain?\"      And the buffalo said \"Go on to the bank of the Ganges.\" Then they came  to a horse and they thought that they would catch it and mount it,  but it kicked and snorted; and they sang:--          \"Dharmu tries to catch the horse:      But it kicks and runs away.      How shall we reach the Ganges?      O Karam Gosain, how far off are you?\"      And the horse said \"Go to the banks of the Ganges.\" Then they saw an  elephant but it would not let them approach, so they decided to push  on straight for the river; and they saw under a banyan tree a large  pot full of rupees, but they were so disheartened that they made no  attempt to touch it; then they met a woman who asked where they were  going and when she heard, she said \"For twelve years I have had a _pai_  measure stuck on my throat; ask Karam Gosain for me how I am to get  rid of it,\" and they promised; and going on they met a woman with a  bundle of thatching grass stuck to her head; and she made them promise  to ask Karam Gosain how she could be freed; then they met a woman with  both her feet burning in a fire and another with a stool stuck fast  to her back and they promised to enquire how these might be delivered.    So at last they came to the Ganges and they stood on the bank and  called to Karam Gosain; and when he came they caught hold of him and  he said \"Fie, what low caste person is touching me?\" But they said. \"It  is no low caste person, but Dharmu.\" Then they bathed him and anointed  him with oil and turmeric and wrapped him in the new cloth which they  had brought, and thus they persuaded him to return; so they rose up  to go back, and Dharmu asked about the women whom they had met, and  Karam Gosain said: \"The woman has a stool stuck to her back because  when visitors came she never offered them a seat; let her do so in  future, and she will be freed; and the woman has her feet burning in  the fire because she pushed the fuel into the fire with her foot; let  her not do so in future, and she will be freed; and the woman has the  thatching grass stuck to her head because when she saw a friend with  straw sticking in her hair she did not tell her about it; let her do  so in future and she will be freed; and the woman has the pai measure  stuck to her throat because, when her neighbour wanted to borrow her  measure, she would not lend it; let her do so in future and she will  be freed.\" And Karam Gosain asked whether they had seen an elephant  and a horse and a buffalo and a cow and money and mangoes and figs and  Dharmu said \"Yes,\" but that he had not been able to catch the animals  and the fruit was bad. Karam Gosain promised them that on their way  back they should take possession of all; and they did so and mounted  on the elephant and returned to their home with great wealth. On their  way they met the four women and told them how they could be saved from  their troubles. The villagers welcomed Dharmu and he arranged a great  feast and gave paddy to all the villagers to husk; but when they had  boiled it the weather became cloudy so that they could not dry it,  so they prayed to the sun and he at once shone out and dried the paddy.    Then a day was fixed and they prepared rice beer, and worshipped  Karam Gosain and they danced all night and got very drunk and enjoyed  themselves.          VI. The Jealous Stepmother.    There was once a man whose wife died leaving him with one son and  after a year he married again. The second wife was very jealous of the  son and she told her husband that she would not stay with him unless  he killed the boy; at first he refused but she insisted and then he  said that he was frightened to do the deed, but she might kill the  boy herself if she liked. She said, \"No: he is your son and you must  kill him; if he were mine I would do it. You need not be frightened;  when you take him out ploughing make him drive the front plough, and  you sharpen your plough pole to a point and drive it into him from  behind and kill him and then it will seem to be an accident.\" So the  man promised and made a sharp point to his plough pole but whenever  they ploughed, the son drove his plough so fast that the father could  not catch him up and so the boy was not killed; then the woman abused  her husband and said that he was deceiving her. So he promised to  finish the business the next day and told her to give the boy a good  hot breakfast before they started, so that he might receive one last  kindness, and he said that they must find some other way of killing  him because all the ploughing was finished; but his wife told him he  could plough down their crop of _goondli_, the bullocks would stop  to eat the _goondli_ as they went along and so he would easily catch  up his son. Accordingly the next morning father and son took out the  ploughs and the boy asked where they should plough, and the father said  that they would plough down the field of _goondli_. But the boy said  \"Why should we do that? it is a good crop and will be ripe in a day  or two; it is too late to sow again, we shall lose this crop and who  knows whether we shall get anything in its place?\"    And the father thought 'What the boy says is true; the first crop  is like "]]]
