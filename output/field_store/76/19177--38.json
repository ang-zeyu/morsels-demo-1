The  back porch was enclosed with sheeting for the room, and the  apparatus consisted of a galvanized-iron pail with a short nipple  soldered in the center of the bottom and fitted with a valve and  sprinkler. The whole, after filling the pail with water, was  raised above one's head with a rope run over a pulley fastened to  the roof of the porch, and a tub was used on the floor to catch  the water. A knot should be tied in the rope at the right place,  to keep it from running out of the pulley while the pail is  lowered to be filled with water, and a loop made in the end, which  is placed over a screw hook turned into the wall. If the loop is  tied at the proper place, the pail will be raised to the right  height for the person taking the shower bath.    The water will run from 10 to 15 minutes. The addition of some hot  water will make a splendid shower bath.  --Contributed by Dr. C. H.

Several old hubs with the proper size bore  were secured. These were put on an arbor and turned to the size of  the bottom of the teeth. Hole were drilled and tapped to  correspond to the number of teeth required and old stud bolts  turned into them. The wheels were again placed on the arbor and  the studs turned to the required size. After rounding the ends of  the studs, the sprockets were ready for use and gave perfect  satisfaction.  --Contributed by Charles Stem, Phillipsburg, New York.        ** Pot-Cover Closet [16]    The sides of the cover closet are cut as shown in Fig. 1 and  shelves are nailed between them at a slight angle.

The simple homemade device shown in the accompanying  sketch greatly assists    [Illustration: Bottle in Stand]    in this work. It consists of a stand to hold a bottle, the mouth  of which rests against a. small gate directly in the rear of the  attached tin trough. The weight of the bottle and the contents  against the gate serves as a check or stopper. If the gate is  raised slightly, it will permit a continuous flow of liquid of the  desired amount.        ** Saving Overexposed Developing Prints [16]    In using developing papers, either for contact printing or  enlargements, you are, by all rules of the game, entitled to a  certain number of overexposed prints, says a correspondent of  Camera Craft. But there is no reason why you should lose either  the paper or the time and trouble expended in making these prints.  By using the following method, you can turn these very dark prints  into good ones.    First: these overexposed prints must be fully developed. Do not  try to save them by rushing them out of the developer into the  short-stop or fixing bath. The results will be poor, and, if you  try to tone them afterward, the color will be an undesirable,  sickly one. Develop them into strong prints, thoroughly fix, and  wash until you are sure all hypo is removed. In my own practice, I  carry out this part of the work thoroughly, then dry the prints  and lay aside these dark ones until there is an accumulation of a  dozen or more, doing this to avoid too frequent use of the very  poisonous bleaching solution. The bleacher is made up as follows  and should be plainly marked \"Poison.\"        Cyanide of potassium ....... 2 oz.      Iodide of potassium ....... 20 gr.      Water ..................... 16 oz.    Place the dry print, without previous wetting, in this solution.  It will bleach slowly and evenly, but, when it starts to bleach,  transfer it to a tray of water, where it will continue to bleach.  When the desired reduction has taken place, stop the action at  once by immersing the print in a 10-per-cent solution of borax.  The prints may be allowed to remain in this last solution until  they are finished. A good final washing completes the process.  This washing must be thorough and a sponge or a tuft of cotton  used to clean the surface of the print.    With a little practice, this method of saving prints that are too  dark becomes easy and certain. The prints are lightened and at the  same time improved in tone, being made blue-black with a delicate  and pleasing quality that will tempt you to purposely overexpose  some of your prints in order to tone them by this method for  certain effects. The process is particularly valuable to the  worker in large sizes, as it provides a means of making quite a  saving of paper that would otherwise be thrown away.        ** An Ironing-Board Stand [17]    An ordinary ironing board is cut square on the large end and a  slot cut 1-1/2 in. wide and 4 in. long to admit the angle support.

Fold each one from corner to  corner as shown in Fig. 1 and again as in Fig. 2. Paste the last  fold together and the corner holders are complete. Put one on each  corner of the blotting paper. They can be fastened with a small  brass paper fastener put through the top of the holder.

Make a design similar to that shown, the  head of which is 2 in. wide, the shaft 1 in. wide below the    [Illustration: FIG. 1 Fig. 2 The Pattern and the Finished  Bookmark]    head and the extreme length 4-1/2 in. Make one-half of the design,  as shown in Fig. 1, freehand, then trace the other half in the  usual way, after folding along the center line. Trace the design  on the metal, using carbon paper, which gives the outline of the  design Fig. 2.    With the metal shears, cut out the outline as indicated by the  drawing. With files, smooth off any roughness    [Illustration: Drilling and Sawing the Metal]    and form the edge so that it shall be nicely rounded.    The parts of the design in heavy color may be treated in several  ways. A very satisfactory treatment is obtained by etching, then  coloring. Clean the metal thoroughly with pumice stone and water  or with alcohol before the design is applied. Cover all the metal  that is not to be lowered with a thick coating of asphaltum. Allow  this to dry, then put on a second coat. After this has dried,  thoroughly immerse the metal in a solution composed as follows: 3  parts water, 1 part sulphuric acid, 1 part nitric acid.    Allow the metal to remain in this solution until the exposed part  has been eaten about 1/32 in. deep, then remove it and clean off  the asphaltum, using turpentine. Do not put the hands in the  solution, but use a swab on a stick.    For coloring olive green, use 2 parts water to 1 part permuriate  of iron. Apply with a small brush.    The lines at A and B will need to be cut, using a small metal saw.  Pierce a hole with a small drill, Fig. 3, large enough to receive  the saw and cut along the lines as in Fig. 4. A piece of wood with  a V-shaped notch which is fastened firmly to the bench forms the  best place in which to do such sawing. The teeth of the saw should  be so placed that the sawing will be done on the downward stroke.  The metal must be held firmly, and the saw allowed time to make  its cut, being held perpendicular to the work.    After the sawing, smooth the edges of the metal with a small file  and emery paper.

From this time forward we find the trader  and the priest advancing in the wilderness; sometimes one is first,  sometimes the other.    Champlain accompanied his Indian allies on an expedition against the  Onondagas, one of the five nations who occupied the country immediately  to the south of the upper St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario. The party  reached Lake Ontario by the system of inland navigation which stretches  from Lake Simcoe to the Bay of Quinte. The Onondagas repulsed the  Canadian allies who returned to their settlements, where Champlain  remained during the winter of 1616. It was during this expedition, which  did much to weaken Champlain's prestige among the Indians, that Etienne  Brule an interpreter, was sent to the Andastes, who were then living  about the headwaters of the Susquehanna, with the hope of bringing them  to the support of the Canadian savages. He was not seen again until  1618, when he returned to Canada with a story, doubtless correct, of  having found himself on the shores of a great lake where there were  mines of copper, probably Lake Superior.    With the new era of peace that followed the coming of the Viceroy Tracy  in 1665, and the establishment of a royal government, a fresh impulse  was given to exploration and mission work in the west. Priests,  fur-traders, gentlemen-adventurers, _coureurs de bois_, now appeared  frequently on the lakes and rivers of the west, and gave in the course  of years a vast region to the dominion of France. As early as 1665  Father Allouez established a mission at La Pointe, the modern Ashland,  on the shores of Lake Superior. In 1668 one of the most interesting  persons who ever appeared in early Canada, the missionary and explorer,  Father Marquette, founded the mission of Sainte-Marie on the southern  side of the Sault, which may be considered the oldest settlement of the  north-west, as it alone has a continuous history to the present time.    In the record of those times we see strikingly displayed certain  propensities of the Canadian people which seriously interfered with the  settlement and industry of the country. The fur-trade had far more  attractions for the young and adventurous than the regular and active  life of farming on the seigniories. The French immigrant as well as the  native Canadian adapted himself to the conditions of Indian life.  Wherever the Indian tribes were camped in the forest or by the river,  and the fur-trade could be prosecuted to the best advantage, we see the  _coureurs de bois_, not the least picturesque figures of these grand  woods, then in the primeval sublimity of their solitude and vastness.  Despite the vices and weaknesses of a large proportion of this class,  not a few were most useful in the work of exploration and exercised a  great influence among the Indians of the West. But for these  forest-rangers the Michigan region would have fallen into the possession  of the English who were always intriguing with the Iroquois and  endeavouring to obtain a share of the fur-trade of the west. Joliet, the  companion of Marquette, in his ever-memorable voyage to the Mississippi,  was a type of the best class of the Canadian fur-trader.    In 1671 Sieur St. Lusson took formal possession of the Sault and the  adjacent country in the name of Louis XIV. In 1673 Fort Frontenac was  built at Cataraqui, now Kingston, as a barrier to the aggressive  movements of the Iroquois and an _entrepot_ for the fur-trade on Lake  Ontario. In the same year Joliet and Marquette solved a part of the  problem which had so long perplexed the explorers of the West. The  trader and priest reached the Mississippi by the way of Green Bay, the  Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. They went down the Mississippi as far as the  Arkansas. Though they were still many hundreds of miles from the mouth  of the river, they grasped the fact that it must reach, not the western  ocean, but the southern gulf first discovered by the Spaniards.  Marquette died not long afterwards, worn out by his labours in the  wilderness, and was buried beneath the little chapel at St. Ignace.  Joliet's name henceforth disappears from the annals of the West.    Rene Robert Cavelier, better known as the Sieur de la Salle, completed  the work commenced by the trader and missionary. In 1666 he obtained a  grant of land at the head of the rapids above Montreal by the side of  that beautiful expanse of the St. Lawrence, still called Lachine, a name  first given in derisive allusion to his hope of finding a short route to  China. In 1679 he saw the Niagara Falls for the first time, and the  earliest sketch is to be found in _La Nouvelle Decouverte_ written or  compiled by that garrulous, vain, and often mendacious Recollet Friar,  Louis Hennepin, who accompanied La Salle on this expedition. In the  winter of 1681-82 this famous explorer reached the Mississippi, and for  weeks followed its course through the novel and wondrous scenery of a  southern land. On the 9th of April, 1682, at a point just above the  mouth of the great river, La Salle took formal possession of the  Mississippi valley in the name of Louis XIV, with the same imposing  ceremonies that distinguished the claim asserted by St. Lusson at the  Sault in the lake region. By the irony of fate, La Salle failed to  discover the mouth of the river when he came direct from France to the  Gulf of Mexico in 1685, but landed somewhere on Matagorda Bay on the  Texan coast, where he built a fort for temporary protection. Finding his  position untenable, he decided in 1687 to make an effort to reach the  Illinois country, but when he had been a few days on this perilous  journey he was treacherously murdered by some of his companions near the  southern branch of Trinity River. His body was left to the beasts and  birds of prey. Two of the murderers were themselves killed by their  accomplices, none of whom appear ever to have been brought to justice  for their participation in a crime by which France lost one of the  bravest and ablest men who ever struggled for her dominion in North  America.    Some years later the famous Canadians, Iberville and Bienville, founded  a colony in the great valley, known by the name of Louisiana, which was  first given to it by La Salle himself. By the possession of the Sault,  Mackinac, and Detroit, the French were for many years supreme on the  lakes, and had full control of Indian trade. The Iroquois and their  English friends were effectively shut out of the west by the French  posts and settlements which followed the explorations of Joliet, La  Salle, Du Luth, and other adventurers. Plans continued to be formed for  reaching the Western or Pacific ocean even in the middle of the  eighteenth century. The Jesuit Charlevoix, the historian of New France,  was sent out to Canada by the French government to enquire into the  feasibility of a route which Frenchmen always hoped for. Nothing  definite came out of this mission, but the Jesuit was soon followed by  an enterprising native of Three Rivers, Pierre Gaultier de Varennes,  generally called the Sieur de la Verendrye, who with his sons ventured  into the region now known as the province of Manitoba and the north-west  territory of Canada. He built several forts, including one on the site  of the city of Winnipeg. Two of his sons are believed to have reached  the Big Horn Range, an \"outlying buttress\" of the Rocky Mountains, in  1743, and to have taken possession of what is now territory of the  United States. The youngest son, Chevalier de la Verendrye, who was the  first to see the Rocky Mountains, subsequently discovered the  Saskatchewan (Poskoiac) and even ascended it as far as the forks--the  furthest western limits so far touched by a white man in America. A few  years later, in 1751, M. de Niverville, under the orders of M. de St.  Pierre, then acting in the interest of the infamous Intendant Bigot, who  coveted the western fur-trade, reached the foot-hills of the Rocky  Mountains and built a fort on the Saskatchewan not far from the present  town of Calgary.    We have now followed the paths of French adventurers for nearly a  century and a half, from the day Champlain landed on the rocks of Quebec  until the Verendryes traversed the prairies and plains of the  North-west. French explorers had discovered the three great waterways of  this continent--the Mississippi, which pours its enormous volume of  water, drawn from hundreds of tributaries, into a southern gulf; the St.  Lawrence, which bears the tribute of the great lakes to the Atlantic  Ocean; the Winnipeg, with its connecting rivers and lakes which stretch  from the Rocky Mountains to the dreary Arctic sea. La Verendrye was the  first Frenchman who stood on the height of land or elevated plateau of  the continent, almost within sight of the sources of those great rivers  which flow, after devious courses, north, south and east. It has been  well said that if three men should ascend these three waterways to their  farthest sources, they would find themselves in the heart of North  America; and, so to speak, within a stone's throw of one another. Nearly  all the vast territory, through which these great waterways flow, then  belonged to France, so far as exploration, discovery and partial  occupation gave her a right to exercise dominion. Only in the great  North, where summer is a season of a very few weeks, where icebergs bar  the way for many months, where the fur-trade and the whale-fishery alone  offered an incentive to capital and enterprise, had England a right to  an indefinite dominion. Here a \"Company of Gentlemen-Adventurers  trading into Hudson's Bay\" occupied some fortified stations which,  during the seventeenth century, had been seized by the daring  French-Canadian corsair,"]]]
