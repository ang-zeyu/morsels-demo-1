Similarly you may say, if you like, that the bold determinist  speculator is free to disbelieve in the reality of the will.  But it is a much more massive and important fact that he is not  free to raise, to curse, to thank, to justify, to urge, to punish,  to resist temptations, to incite mobs, to make New Year resolutions,  to pardon sinners, to rebuke tyrants, or even to say \"thank you\"  for the mustard.         In passing from this subject I may note that there is a queer  fallacy to the effect that materialistic fatalism is in some way  favourable to mercy, to the abolition of cruel punishments or  punishments of any kind.  This is startlingly the reverse of the truth.  It is quite tenable that the doctrine of necessity makes no difference  at all; that it leaves the flogger flogging and the kind friend  exhorting as before.  But obviously if it stops either of them it  stops the kind exhortation.  That the sins are inevitable does not  prevent punishment; if it prevents anything it prevents persuasion.  Determinism is quite as likely to lead to cruelty as it is certain  to lead to cowardice.  Determinism is not inconsistent with the  cruel treatment of criminals.  What it is (perhaps) inconsistent  with is the generous treatment of criminals; with any appeal to  their better feelings or encouragement in their moral struggle.  The determinist does not believe in appealing to the will, but he does  believe in changing the environment.  He must not say to the sinner,  \"Go and sin no more,\" because the sinner cannot help it.  But he  can put him in boiling oil; for boiling oil is an environment.  Considered as a figure, therefore, the materialist has the fantastic  outline of the figure of the madman.  Both take up a position  at once unanswerable and intolerable.         Of course it is not only of the materialist that all this is true.  The same would apply to the other extreme of speculative logic.  There is a sceptic far more terrible than he who believes that  everything began in matter.  It is possible to meet the sceptic  who believes that everything began in himself.  He doubts not the  existence of angels or devils, but the existence of men and cows.  For him his own friends are a mythology made up by himself.  He created his own father and his own mother.  This horrible  fancy has in it something decidedly attractive to the somewhat  mystical egoism of our day.  That publisher who thought that men  would get on if they believed in themselves, those seekers after  the Superman who are always looking for him in the looking-glass,  those writers who talk about impressing their personalities instead  of creating life for the world, all these people have really only  an inch between them and this awful emptiness.  Then when this  kindly world all round the man has been blackened out like a lie;  when friends fade into ghosts, and the foundations of the world fail;  then when the man, believing in nothing and in no man, is alone  in his own nightmare, then the great individualistic motto shall  be written over him in avenging irony.  The stars will be only dots  in the blackness of his own brain; his mother's face will be only  a sketch from his own insane pencil on the walls of his cell.  But over his cell shall be written, with dreadful truth, \"He believes  in himself.\"           All that concerns us here, however, is to note that this  panegoistic extreme of thought exhibits the same paradox as the  other extreme of materialism.  It is equally complete in theory  and equally crippling in practice.  For the sake of simplicity,  it is easier to state the notion by saying that a man can believe  that he is always in a dream.  Now, obviously there can be no positive  proof given to him that he is not in a dream, for the simple reason  that no proof can be offered that might not be offered in a dream.  But if the man began to burn down London and say that his housekeeper  would soon call him to breakfast, we should take him and put him  with other logicians in a place which has often been alluded to in  the course of this chapter.  The man who cannot believe his senses,  and the man who cannot believe anything else, are both insane,  but their insanity is proved not by any error in their argument,  but by the manifest mistake of their whole lives.  They have both  locked themselves up in two boxes, painted inside with the sun  and stars; they are both unable to get out, the one into the  health and happiness of heaven, the other even into the health  and happiness of the earth.  Their position is quite reasonable;  nay, in a sense it is infinitely reasonable, just as a threepenny  bit is infinitely circular.  But there is such a thing as a mean  infinity, a base and slavish eternity.  It is amusing to notice  that many of the moderns, whether sceptics or mystics, have taken  as their sign a certain eastern symbol, which is the very symbol  of this ultimate nullity.  When they wish to represent eternity,  they represent it by a serpent with his tail in his mouth.  There is  a startling sarcasm in the image of that very unsatisfactory meal.  The eternity of the material fatalists, the eternity of the  eastern pessimists, the eternity of the supercilious theosophists  and higher scientists of to-day is, indeed, very well presented  by a serpent eating his tail, a degraded animal who destroys even himself.         This chapter is purely practical and is concerned with what  actually is the chief mark and element of insanity; we may say  in summary that it is reason used without root, reason in the void.  The man who begins to think without the proper first principles goes mad;  he begins to think at the wrong end.  And for the rest of these pages  we have to try and discover what is the right end.  But we may ask  in conclusion, if this be what drives men mad, what is it that keeps  them sane?  By the end of this book I hope to give a definite,  some will think a far too definite, answer.  But for the moment it  is possible in the same solely practical manner to give a general  answer touching what in actual human history keeps men sane.  Mysticism keeps men sane.  As long as you have mystery you have health;  when you destroy mystery you create morbidity.  The ordinary man has  always been sane because the ordinary man has always been a mystic.  He has permitted the twilight.  He has always had one foot in earth  and the other in fairyland.  He has always left himself free to doubt  his gods; but (unlike the agnostic of to-day) free also to believe  in them.  He has always cared more for truth than for consistency.  If he saw two truths that seemed to contradict each other,  he would take the two truths and the contradiction along with them.  His spiritual sight is stereoscopic, like his physical sight:  he sees two different pictures at once and yet sees all the better  for that.  Thus he has always believed that there was such a thing  as fate, but such a thing as free will also.  Thus he believed  that children were indeed the kingdom of heaven, but nevertheless  ought to be obedient to the kingdom of earth.  He admired youth  because it was young and age because it was not.  It is exactly  this balance of apparent contradictions that has been the whole  buoyancy of the healthy man.  The whole secret of mysticism is this:  that man can understand everything by the help of what he does  not understand.  The morbid logician seeks to make everything lucid,  and succeeds in making everything mysterious.  The mystic allows  one thing to be mysterious, and everything else becomes lucid.  The determinist makes the theory of causation quite clear,  and then finds that he cannot say \"if you please\" to the housemaid.  The Christian permits free will to remain a sacred mystery; but because  of this his relations with the housemaid become of a sparkling and  crystal clearness.  He puts the seed of dogma in a central darkness;  but it branches forth in all directions with abounding natural health.  As we have taken the circle as the symbol of reason and madness,  we may very well take the cross as the symbol at once of mystery and  of health.  Buddhism is centripetal, but Christianity is centrifugal:  it breaks out.  For the circle is perfect and infinite in its nature;  but it is fixed for ever in its size; it can never be larger  or smaller.  But the cross, though it has at its heart a collision  and a contradiction, can extend its four arms for ever without  altering its shape.  Because it has a paradox in its centre it can  grow without changing.  The circle returns upon itself and is bound.  The cross opens its arms to the four winds; it is a signpost for free  travellers.         Symbols alone are of even a cloudy value in speaking of this  deep matter; and another symbol from physical nature will express  sufficiently well the real place of mysticism before mankind.  The one created thing which we cannot look at is the one thing in  the light of which we look at everything.  Like the sun at noonday,  mysticism explains everything else by the blaze of its own  victorious invisibility.  Detached intellectualism is (in the  exact sense of a popular phrase) all moonshine; for it is light  without heat, and it is secondary light, reflected from a dead world.  But the Greeks were right when they made Apollo the god both of  imagination and of sanity; for he was both the patron of poetry  and the patron of healing.  Of necessary dogmas and a special creed  I shall speak later.  But that transcendentalism by which all men  live has primarily much the position of the sun in the sky.  We are conscious of it as of a kind of splendid confusion;  it is something both shining and shapeless, at once a blaze and  a blur.  But the circle of the moon is as clear and unmistakable,  as recurrent and inevitable, as the circle of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1300"],[0,"Riders of the Purple Sage (#5)"],[1,"sage, a dark, compact body of horsemen went by, almost without sound,  almost like specters, and they, too, melted into the night.        CHAPTER III. AMBER SPRING    No unusual circumstances was it for Oldring and some of his men to visit  Cottonwoods in the broad light of day, but for him to prowl about in  the dark with the hoofs of his horses muffled meant that mischief was  brewing. Moreover, to Venters the presence of the masked rider with  Oldring seemed especially ominous. For about this man there was mystery,  he seldom rode through the village, and when he did ride through it  was swiftly; riders seldom met by day on the sage, but wherever he rode  there always followed deeds as dark and mysterious as the mask he wore.  Oldring's band did not confine themselves to the rustling of cattle.    Venters lay low in the shade of the cottonwoods, pondering this chance  meeting, and not for many moments did he consider it safe to move on.  Then, with sudden impulse, he turned the other way and went back along  the grove. When he reached the path leading to Jane's home he decided  to go down to the village. So he hurried onward, with quick soft steps.  Once beyond the grove he entered the one and only street. It was  wide, lined with tall poplars, and under each row of trees, inside the  foot-path, were ditches where ran the water from Jane Withersteen's  spring.    Between the trees twinkled lights of cottage candles, and far down  flared bright windows of the village stores. When Venters got closer to  these he saw knots of men standing together in earnest conversation. The  usual lounging on the corners and benches and steps was not in evidence.  Keeping in the shadow Venters went closer and closer until he could hear  voices. But he could not distinguish what was said. He recognized many  Mormons, and looked hard for Tull and his men, but looked in vain.  Venters concluded that the rustlers had not passed along the village  street. No doubt these earnest men were discussing Lassiter's coming.  But Venters felt positive that Tull's intention toward himself that day  had not been and would not be revealed.    So Venters, seeing there was little for him to learn, began retracing  his steps. The church was dark, Bishop Dyer's home next to it was also  dark, and likewise Tull's cottage. Upon almost any night at this hour  there would be lights here, and Venters marked the unusual omission.    As he was about to pass out of the street to skirt the grove, he once  more slunk down at the sound of trotting horses. Presently he descried  two mounted men riding toward him. He hugged the shadow of a tree. Again  the starlight, brighter now, aided him, and he made out Tull's stalwart  figure, and beside him the short, froglike shape of the rider Jerry.  They were silent, and they rode on to disappear.    Venters went his way with busy, gloomy mind, revolving events of  the day, trying to reckon those brooding in the night. His thoughts  overwhelmed him. Up in that dark grove dwelt a woman who had been his  friend. And he skulked about her home, gripping a gun stealthily as an  Indian, a man without place or people or purpose. Above her hovered the  shadow of grim, hidden, secret power. No queen could have given more  royally out of a bounteous store than Jane Withersteen gave her people,  and likewise to those unfortunates whom her people hated. She asked only  the divine right of all women--freedom; to love and to live as her heart  willed. And yet prayer and her hope were vain.    \"For years I've seen a storm clouding over her and the village of  Cottonwoods,\" muttered Venters, as he strode on. \"Soon it'll burst. I  don't like the prospects.\" That night the villagers whispered in the  street--and night-riding rustlers muffled horses--and Tull was at work  in secret--and out there in the sage hid a man who meant something  terrible--Lassiter!    Venters passed the black cottonwoods, and, entering the sage, climbed  the gradual slope. He kept his direction in line with a western star.  From time to time he stopped to listen and heard only the usual familiar  bark of coyote and sweep of wind and rustle of sage. Presently a low  jumble of rocks loomed up darkly somewhat to his right, and, turning  that way, he whistled softly. Out of the rocks glided a dog that leaped  and whined about him. He climbed over rough, broken rock, picking his  way carefully, and then went down. Here it was darker, and sheltered  from the wind. A white object guided him. It was another dog, and this  one was asleep, curled up between a saddle and a pack. The animal  awoke and thumped his tail in greeting. Venters placed the saddle for a  pillow, rolled in his blankets, with his face upward to the stars. The  white dog snuggled close to him. The other whined and pattered a few  yards to the rise of ground and there crouched on guard. And in that  wild covert Venters shut his eyes under the great white stars and  intense vaulted blue, bitterly comparing their loneliness to his own,  and fell asleep.    When he awoke, day had dawned and all about him was bright steel-gray.  The air had a cold tang. Arising, he greeted the fawning dogs and  stretched his cramped body, and then, gathering together bunches of dead  sage sticks, he lighted a fire. Strips of dried beef held to the blaze  for a moment served him and the dogs. He drank from a canteen. There was  nothing else in his outfit; he had grown used to a scant fire. Then he  sat over the fire, palms outspread, and waited. Waiting had been his  chief occupation for months, and he scarcely knew what he waited for  unless it was the passing of the hours. But now he sensed action in the  immediate present; the day promised another meeting with Lassiter and  Jane, perhaps news of the rustlers; on the morrow he meant to take the  trail to Deception Pass.    And while he waited he talked to his dogs. He called them Ring and  Whitie; they were sheep-dogs, half collie, half deerhound, superb in  build, perfectly trained. It seemed that in his fallen fortunes these  dogs understood the nature of their value to him, and governed their  affection and faithfulness accordingly. Whitie watched him with somber  eyes of love, and Ring, crouched on the little rise of ground above,  kept tireless guard. When the sun rose, the white dog took the place of  the other, and Ring went to sleep at his master's feet.    By and by Venters rolled up his blankets and tied them and his meager  pack together, then climbed out to look for his horse. He saw him,  presently, a little way off in the sage, and went to fetch him. In that  country, where every rider boasted of a fine mount and was eager for a  race, where thoroughbreds dotted the wonderful grazing ranges, Venters  rode a horse that was sad proof of his misfortunes.    Then, with his back against a stone, Venters faced the east, and, stick  in hand and idle blade, he waited. The glorious sunlight filled the  valley with purple fire. Before him, to left, to right, waving, rolling,  sinking, rising, like low swells of a purple sea, stretched the sage.  Out of the grove of cottonwoods, a green patch on the purple, gleamed  the dull red of Jane Withersteen's old stone house. And from there  extended the wide green of the village gardens and orchards marked by  the graceful poplars; and farther down shone the deep, dark richness of  the alfalfa fields. Numberless red and black and white dots speckled the  sage, and these were cattle and horses.    So, watching and waiting, Venters let the time wear away. At length he  saw a horse rise above a ridge, and he knew it to be Lassiter's  black. Climbing to the highest rock, so that he would show against the  sky-line, he stood and waved his hat. The almost instant turning of  Lassiter's horse attested to the quickness of that rider's eye. Then  Venters climbed down, saddled his horse, tied on his pack, and, with  a word to his dogs, was about to ride out to meet Lassiter, when he  concluded to wait for him there, on higher ground, where the outlook was  commanding.    It had been long since Venters had experienced friendly greeting from  a man. Lassiter's warmed in him something that had grown cold from  neglect. And when he had returned it, with a strong grip of the iron  hand that held his, and met the gray eyes, he knew that Lassiter and he  were to be friends.    \"Venters, let's talk awhile before we go down there,\" said Lassiter,  slipping his bridle. \"I ain't in no hurry. Them's sure fine dogs you've  got.\" With a rider's eye he took in the points of Venter's horse, but  did not speak his thought. \"Well, did anythin' come off after I left you  last night?\"    Venters told him about the rustlers.    \"I was snug hid in the sage,\" replied Lassiter, \"an' didn't see or hear  no one. Oldrin's got a high hand here, I reckon. It's no news up in  Utah how he holes in canyons an' leaves no track.\" Lassiter was silent a  moment. \"Me an' Oldrin' wasn't exactly strangers some years back when he  drove cattle into Bostil's Ford, at the head of the Rio Virgin. But he  got harassed there an' now he drives some place else.\"    \"Lassiter, you knew him? Tell me, is he Mormon or Gentile?\"    \"I can't say. I've knowed Mormons who pretended to be Gentiles.\"    \"No Mormon ever pretended that unless he was a rustler,\" declared  Venters.    \"Mebbe so.\"    \"It's a hard country for any one, but hardest for Gentiles. Did you ever  know or hear of a Gentile prospering in a Mormon community?\"    \"I never did.\"    \"Well, I want to get out of Utah. I've a mother living in Illinois. I  want to go home. It's eight years now.\"    The older man's sympathy moved Venters to tell his story. He had left  Quincy, run off to seek his fortune in the gold fields had never gotten  any farther than Salt Lake City, wandered here and there as helper,  teamster, shepherd, and drifted southward over the divide and across the  barrens and up the rugged plateau through"]]]
