Now Sam was an able young fellow, well-boned and willing;  a hard headed cudgel player, and a marvellous tough wrestler, for he had a  backbone like a sea-serpent; this gained him the name of the Twister and  Twiner. He had got into the river, with his back to me, was stooping over  a broad stone, when something bolted from under the bank on which I stood,  right through his legs. Sam fell with a great splash upon his face, but in  falling, jammed whatever it was against the stone. \"Let go, Twister,\"  shouted I, \"'tis an otter, he will nip a finger off you.\"--\"Whisht,\"  sputtered he, as he slid his hand under the water; \"May I never read a  text again, if he isna a sawmont wi' a shouther like a hog!\"--\"Grip him by  the gills, Twister,\" cried I.--\"Saul will I!\" cried the Twiner; but just  then there was a heave, a roll, a splash, a slap like a pistol-shot; down  went Sam, and up went the salmon, spun like a shilling at pitch and toss,  six feet into the air. I leaped in just as he came to the water; but my  foot caught between two stones, and the more I pulled the firmer it stuck.  The fish fell in a spot shallower than that from which he had leaped. Sam  saw the chance, and tackled to again: while I, sitting down in the stream  as best I might, held up my torch, and cried fair play, as shoulder to  shoulder, throughout and about, up and down, roll and tumble, to it they  went, Sam and the salmon. The Twister was never so twined before. Yet  through crossbuttocks and capsizes innumerable, he still held on; now  haled through a pool; now haling up a bank; now heels over head; now head  over heels; now head and heels together; doubled up in a corner; but at  last stretched fairly on his back, and foaming for rage and disappointment;  while the victorious salmon, slapping the stones with his tail, and  whirling the spray from his shoulders at every roll, came boring and  snoring up the ford. I tugged and strained to no purpose; he flashed by me  with a snort, and slid into the deep water. Sam now staggered forward with  battered bones and peeled elbows, blowing like a grampus, and cursing like  nothing but himself. He extricated me, and we limped home. Neither rose  for a week; for I had a dislocated ankle, and the Twister was troubled  with a broken rib. Poor Sam! he had his brains discovered at last by a  poker in a row, and was worm's meat within three months; yet, ere he died,  he had the satisfaction of feasting on his old antagonist, who was man's  meat next morning. They caught him in a net. Sam knew him by the twist in  his tail.--_Blackwood's Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *    DIAMONDS IN BRAZIL.    The operation of working for these precious jems is a very simple one. The  alluvial soil (the cascalhao) is dug up from the bed of the river, and  removed to a convenient spot on the banks for working. The process is as  follows:--a rancho is erected about a hundred feet long, and half that  distance in width; down the middle of the area is conveyed a canal,  covered with earth; on the other side of the area is a flooring of planks,  about sixteen feet in length, extending the whole length of the shed, and  to which an inclined direction is given; this flooring is divided into  troughs, into which is thrown a portion of the cascalhao; the water is  then let in, and the earth raked until the water becomes clear; the earthy  particles having been washed away, the gravel is raked up to the end of  the trough; the largest stones are thrown out, and afterwards the smaller  ones, the whole is then examined with great care for diamonds. When a  negro finds one, he claps his hands, stands in an erect posture, holding  the diamond between his fore-finger and thumb; it is received by one of  the overseers posted on lofty seats, at equal distances, along the line of  the work. On the conclusion of the work, the diamonds found during the day  are weighed, and registered by the overseer _en chef_. If a negro has the  good fortune to find a stone weighing upwards of seventeen carats, he is  immediately manumitted, and for smaller stones proportionate premiums are  given. There are, besides, several other works on this river, and on other  streams, but the supply of diamonds falls now considerably short of former  periods, and their produce scarcely defrays the expenses.    The Diamond District of the Serro do Frio is about twenty leagues in  length, and nine in breadth; the soil is barren, but intersected by  numerous streams. It was first discovered by some miners, shortly after  the establishment of the Villa do Principe. In working for gold in the  rivulets of Milho Verde and St. Goncalzes, they discovered some pebbles of  geometric form, and of a peculiar hue and lustre. For some years these  pebbles were given as pretty baubles to children, or used as counters for  marking the points of their favourite game of voltarete. At last an  officer, who had been some years at Goa, in the East Indies, arrived in  the Commarca: he was struck with the peculiar form of these pebbles, and  from several experiments he made, it struck him that they were diamonds.  He immediately collected a few, and sent them to Holland, where, to the  astonishment of the lapidaries, they were found to be brilliants of the  finest water. It will easily be imagined, that on the arrival of this  intelligence in Brazil, the hitherto despised counters suddenly became the  objects of universal research, and almost immediately disappeared.    The government of Portugal now issued a decree, declaring all diamonds a  monopoly of the crown. For a length of time it was considered that  diamonds were confined solely to the district of Serro Frio. But this is  an error; they are found in almost every part of the empire, particularly  in the remote provinces of Goyazes and Matto Grosso, where there exist  several districtos diamantescos. These gems have been even found on the  tops of the highest mountains; indeed, it is the opinion of the Brazilian  mineralogists that the original diamond formations are in the mountains,  and that they will one day or other be discovered in such quantities, as  to render them objects of comparatively small value.    The largest diamond in the world was found in the river Abaite; about  ninety-two leagues to N.W. of Serro do Frio. The history of its discovery  is romantic:--three Brazilians, Ant. de Souza, Jose Felix Gomes, and  Thomas de Souza, were sentenced, for some supposed misdemeanour, to  perpetual banishment in the wildest part of the interior. Their sentence  was a cruel one; but the region of their exile was the richest in the  world; every river rolled over a bed of gold, every valley contained  inexhaustible mines of diamonds. A suspicion of this kind enabled these  unfortunate men to support the horrors of their fate; they were constantly  sustained by the golden hope of discovering some rich mine, that would  produce a reversion of their hard sentence. Thus they wandered about for  nearly six years, in quest of mines; but fortune was at last propitious.  An excessive draught had laid dry the bed of the river Abaite, and here,  while working for gold, they discovered a diamond of nearly an ounce in  weight. Overwhelmed with joy at this providential discovery, they resolved  to proceed, at all hazards, to Villa Rica, and trust to the mercy of the  crown. The governor, on beholding the magnitude and lustre of the gem,  could scarcely credit the evidence of his senses. He immediately appointed  a commission of the officers of the Diamond District to report on its  nature; and on their pronouncing it a real diamond, it was immediately  dispatched to Lisbon. It is needless to add that the sentence of the three  \"condemnados\" was immediately reversed.    This celebrated diamond has been estimated by Rome de l'Isle at the  enormous sum of three hundred millions sterling. It is uncut, but the late  King of Portugal, who had a passion for precious stones, had a hole bored  through it, in order to wear it suspended about his neck on gala days. No  sovereign possessed so fine a collection of diamonds as this  prince.--_Monthly Mag_.           *       *       *       *       *          NOTES OF A READER.      AMERICAN LIFE.    Mrs. Trollope's amusing book has furnished us with still another page or  two of scenes and sketches:    _Crocodiles on the Mississippi_.    \"It is said that at some points of this dismal river, crocodiles are so  abundant as to add the terror of their attacks to the other sufferings of  a dwelling there. We were told a story of a squatter, who having 'located'  himself close to the river's edge, proceeded to build his cabin. This  operation is soon performed, for social feeling and the love of whiskey  bring all the scanty neighbourhood round a new comer, to aid him in  cutting down trees, and in rolling up the logs, till the mansion is  complete. This was done; the wife and five young children were put in  possession of their new home, and slept soundly after a long march.  Towards day-break the husband and father was awakened by a faint cry, and  looking up, beheld relics of three of his children scattered over the  floor, and an enormous crocodile, with several young-ones around her,  occupied in devouring the remnants of their horrid meal. He looked around  for a weapon, but finding none, and aware that unarmed he could do nothing,  he raised himself gently on his bed, and contrived to crawl from thence  through a window, hoping that his wife, whom he left sleeping, might with  the remaining children rest undiscovered till his return. He flew to his  nearest neighbour and besought his aid; in less than half an hour two men  returned with him, all three well armed; but alas! they were too late! the  wife and her two babes lay mangled on their bloody bed.

The larger towns and villages  are surrounded by gardens and trees, which give them a very pleasant  appearance.  The interior of these towns, however, is said not to be  quite so inviting as one would suppose from a distant view, for it  is asserted that dirty narrow streets, dilapidated houses, etc.,  offend the stranger's sight at every step.  We did not land at any  of these fortresses or towns; for us the right bank of the river was  a forbidden paradise; so we only saw what was beautiful, and escaped  being disenchanted.    Rather late in the evening we cast anchor opposite a village of no  note.          CHAPTER II.

March 31st.    We started early this morning, and at eight o'clock had already  reached Giurgewo.  This town is situate on the left bank of the  Danube, opposite the fortress of Rustschuk.  It contains 16,000  inhabitants, and is one of the chief trading towns of Wallachia.  We  were detained here until four o'clock in the afternoon; for we had  to unload above 600 cwt. of goods and eight carriages, and to take  coals on board in exchange.  Thus we had time to view the interior  of this Wallachian city.    With what disappointed surprise did my fellow-passengers view the  ugliness of this town, which from a distance promises so much!  On  me it made but little impression, for I had seen towns precisely  similar in Galicia.  The streets and squares are full of pits and  holes; the houses are built without the slightest regard to taste or  symmetry, one perhaps projecting halfway across the street, while  its neighbour falls quite into the background.  In some places  wooden booths were erected along each side of the street for the  sale of the commonest necessaries of life and articles of food, and  these places were dignified by the name of \"bazaars.\"  Curiosity led  us into a wine-shop and into a coffee-house.  In both of these we  found only wooden tables and benches; there were hardly any guests;  and the few persons present belonged to the humblest classes.  Glasses and cups are handed to the company without undergoing the  ceremony of rinsing.    We purchased some eggs and butter, and went into the house of one of  the townspeople to prepare ourselves a dish after the German  fashion.  I had thus an opportunity of noticing the internal  arrangements of a house of this description.  The floor of the room  was not boarded, and the window was only half glazed, the remaining  portion being filled up with paper or thin bladder.  For the rest,  every thing was neat and simple enough.  Even a good comfortable  divan was not wanting.  At four o'clock we quitted the town.    The Danube is now only broad for short distances at a time.  It is,  as it were, sown with islands, and its waters are therefore more  frequently parted into several streams than united into one.    In the villages we already notice Greek and Turkish costumes, but  the women and girls do not yet wear veils.    Unfortunately it was so late when we reached the fortress of  Silistria that I could see nothing of it.  A little lower down we  cast anchor for the night.  At an early hour on    April 1st    we sailed past Hirsova, and at two o'clock stopped at Braila, a  fortress occupied by the Russians since the year 1828.  Here  passengers were not allowed to land, as they were considered  infected with the plague; but our officer stepped forward, and  vouched for the fact that we had neither landed nor taken up any one  on the right bank of the river; thereupon the strangers were allowed  to set foot on terra firma.    By four o'clock we were opposite Galatz, one of the most  considerable commercial towns, with 8000 inhabitants,--the only  harbour the Russians possess on the Danube.  Here we saw the first  merchant-ships and barques of all kinds coming from the Black Sea.  Some sea-gulls also, heralds of the neighbouring ocean, soared above  our heads.    The scene here is one of traffic and bustle; Galatz being the place  of rendezvous for merchants and travellers from two quarters of the  globe, Europe and Asia.  It is the point of junction of three great  empires--Austria, Russia, and Turkey.    After the officer had repeated his assurances as at Braila, we were  permitted to leave the ship.  I had a letter of recommendation to  the Austrian consul, who accidentally came on board; after reading  my letter he received me very kindly, and most obligingly procured  quarters for me.    The town promises much, but proves to be just such a miserable dirty  place as Giurgewo.  The houses are generally built of wood or clay,  thatched with straw; those alone belonging to the consul and the  rich merchants are of stone.  The finest buildings are the Christian  church and the Moldavian hotel.    Though Galatz lies on the Danube, water for drinking is a dear  article among the inhabitants.  Wells are to be found neither in the  houses nor in the squares.  The townspeople are compelled to bring  all the water they require from the Danube, which is a great  hardship for the poor people, and a considerable expense for the  rich; in winter a small tub of water costs from 10 to 12 kreutzers  (about 4d. or 5d.) in the more distant quarters of the town.  At  every corner you meet water-carriers, and little wagons loaded with  tubs of water.  Attempts have frequently been made to procure this  indispensable element by digging; water has, indeed, in some  instances gushed forth, but it always had a brackish taste.    In Galatz we made a halt of twenty-four hours:  the delay was not of  the most agreeable kind, as neither the town itself nor its environs  offer any thing worthy of remark.  Still I always think of these  days with pleasure.  Herr Consul Huber is a polite and obliging man;  himself a traveller, he gave me many a hint and many a piece of  advice for my journey.  The air of quiet comfort which reigned  throughout his house was also not to be despised by one who had just  endured many days of privation; at Herr Huber's I found relief both  for body and mind.    April 2d.    The scenery round the town is so far from being inviting, that I did  not feel the least inclination to explore it.  I therefore remained  in the town, and went up hill and down dale through the ill-paved  streets.  Coffee-houses appear in great abundance; but if it were  not for the people sitting in front of them drinking coffee and  smoking tobacco, no one would do these dirty rooms the honour of  taking them for places of entertainment.    In the market and the squares we notice a great preponderance of the  male sex over the female.  The former are seen bustling about every  where, and, like the Italians, perform some duties which usually  fall to the lot of the softer sex.  We notice a mixture of the most  different nations, and among them a particularly large number of  Jews.    The bazaar is overloaded with southern fruits of all kinds.  Oranges  and lemons are seen here in great numbers, like the commonest of our  fruits.  The prices are of course very trifling.  The cauliflowers  brought from Asia Minor are particularly fine.  I noticed many as  large as a man's head.    In the evening I was required to repair to the harbour and re-  embark.    It is almost impossible to form an idea of the confusion which  reigns here.  A wooden railing forms the barrier between the healthy  people and those who come from or intend travelling to a country  infected with the plague.  Whoever passes this line of demarcation  is not allowed to return.  Soldiers, officers, government officials,  and superintendents, the latter of whom are armed with sticks and  pairs of tongs, stand at the entrance to drive those forcibly back  who will not be content with fair words.  Provisions and other  articles are either thrown over the barrier or left in front of it.  In the latter case, however, they may not be touched until the  bearers have departed.  A gentleman on the \"plague\" side wished to  give a letter to one on the other; it was immediately snatched from  his hand and handed across by means of a pair of tongs.  And all  this time such a noise and hubbub is going on, that you can scarcely  hear the sound of your own voice.    \"Pray hand me over my luggage!\" cries one.  \"Keep farther away!  don't come near me, and mind you don't touch me!\" anxiously exclaims  another.  And then the superintendents keep shouting--\"Stand back,  stand back!\" etc.    I was highly entertained by this spectacle; the scene was entirely  new to me.  But on my return, when I shall be one of the prisoners,  I fear I may find it rather tedious.  For this time I was not at all  hindered in the prosecution of my journey.    On the whole, these timid precautions seemed to me exceedingly  uncalled for, particularly at a time when neither the plague nor any  kind of contagious disease prevailed in Turkey.  One of my fellow-  passengers had been banished to our ship on the previous day because  he had had the misfortune to brush against an official on going to  see after his luggage.    At seven o'clock the tattoo is beaten, the grating is shut, and the  farce ends.  We now repaired to the fourth and last steamer, the  Ferdinand.  From first to last we changed vessels six times during a  journey from Vienna to Constantinople; we travelled by four steamers  and twice in boats; a circumstance which cannot be reckoned among  the pleasures of a trip down the Danube.    Though not a large boat, the Ferdinand is comfortable and well  built.  Even the second-clas"]]]
