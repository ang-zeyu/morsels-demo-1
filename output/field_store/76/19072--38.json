And presently this, the  greyness, would clear and fade from about me, even as a dusky cloud, and  I would look out upon a world of darkness, lit here and there with  strange sights. And with my waking into that Future, I waked not to  ignorance; but to a full knowledge of those things which lit the Night  Land; even as a man wakes from sleep each morning, and knows immediately  he wakes, the names and knowledge of the Time which has bred him, and in  which he lives. And the same while, a knowledge I had, as it were  sub-conscious, of this Present--this early life, which now I live so  utterly alone.    In my earliest knowledge of _that_ place, I was a youth, seventeen years  grown, and my memory tells me that when first I waked, or came, as it  might be said, to myself, in that Future, I stood in one of the  embrasures of the Last Redoubt--that great Pyramid of grey metal which  held the last millions of this world from the Powers of the Slayers.    And so full am I of the knowledge of that Place, that scarce can I  believe that none here know; and because I have such difficulty, it may  be that I speak over familiarly of those things of which I know; and  heed not to explain much that it is needful that I should explain to  those who must read here, in this our present day. For there, as I stood  and looked out, I was less the man of years of _this_ age, than the  youth of _that_, with the natural knowledge of _that_ life which I had  gathered by living all my seventeen years of life there; though, until  that my first vision, I (of this Age) knew not of that other and Future  Existence; yet woke to it so naturally as may a man wake here in his bed  to the shining of the morning sun, and know it by name, and the meaning  of aught else. And yet, as I stood there in the vast embrasure, I had  also a knowledge, or memory, of this present life of ours, deep down  within me; but touched with a halo of dreams, and yet with a conscious  longing for One, known even there in a half memory as Mirdath.    As I have said, in my earliest memory, I mind that I stood in an  embrasure, high up in the side of the Pyramid, and looked outwards  through a queer spy-glass to the North-West. Aye, full of youth and with  an adventurous and yet half-fearful heart.    And in my brain was, as I have told, the knowledge that had come to me  in all the years of my life in the Redoubt; and yet until that moment,  this _Man of this Present Time_ had no knowledge of that future  existence; and now I stood and had suddenly the knowledge of a life  already spent in that strange land, and deeper within me the misty  knowings of this our present Age, and, maybe, also of some others.    To the North-West I looked through the queer spy-glass, and saw a  landscape that I had looked upon and pored upon through all the years of  that life, so that I knew how to name this thing and that thing, and  give the very distances of each and every one from the \"Centre-Point\" of  the Pyramid, which was that which had neither length nor breadth, and  was made of polished metal in the Room of Mathematics, where I went  daily to my studies.    To the North-West I looked, and in the wide field of my glass, saw plain  the bright glare of the fire from the Red Pit, shine upwards against the  underside of the vast chin of the North-West Watcher--The Watching Thing  of the North-West.... \"That which hath Watched from the Beginning, and  until the opening of the Gateway of Eternity\" came into my thoughts, as  I looked through the glass ... the words of Aesworpth, the _Ancient_  Poet (though incredibly _future_ to this our time). And suddenly they  seemed at fault; for I looked deep down into my being, and saw, as  dreams are seen, the sunlight and splendour of _this_ our Present Age.  And I was amazed.    And here I must make it clear to all that, even as I waked from _this_  Age, suddenly into _that_ life, so must I--_that_ youth there in the  embrasure--have awakened then to the knowledge of _this_ far-back life  of ours--seeming to him a vision of the very beginnings of eternity, in  the dawn of the world. Oh! I do but dread I make it not sufficient clear  that I and he were both _I_--the same soul. He of that far date seeing  vaguely the life that _was_ (that I do now live in this present Age);  and I of this time beholding the life that I yet shall live. How utterly  strange!    And yet, I do not know that I speak holy truth to say that I, in that  future time, had _no_ knowledge of _this_ life and Age, before that  awakening; for I woke to find that I was one who stood apart from the  other youths, in that I had a dim knowledge--visionary, as it were, of  the past, which confounded, whilst yet it angered, those who were the  men of learning of that age; though of this matter, more anon. But this  I do know, that from that time, onwards, my knowledge and assuredness of  the Past was tenfold; for this my memory of that life told me.    And so to further my telling. Yet before I pass onwards, one other thing  is there of which I shall speak--In the moment in which I waked out of  that youthfulness, into the assured awaredness of _this_ our Age, in  that moment the hunger of this my love flew to me across the ages; so  that what had been but a memory-dream, grew to the pain of _Reality_,  and I knew suddenly that I _lacked_; and from that time onwards, I went,  listening, as even now my life is spent.    And so it was that I (fresh-born in that future time) hungered strangely  for My Beautiful One with all the strength of that new life, knowing  that she had been mine, and might live again, even as I. And so, as I  have said, I hungered, and found that I listened.    And now, to go back from my digression, it was, as I have said, I had  amazement at perceiving, in memory, the unknowable sunshine and  splendour of this age breaking so clear through my hitherto most vague  and hazy visions; so that the ignorance of, Aesworpth was shouted to me  by the things which now I _knew_.    And from that time, onward, for a little space, I was stunned with all  that I knew and guessed and felt; and all of a long while the hunger  grew for that one I had lost in the early days--she who had sung to me  in those faery days of light, that _had been_ in verity. And the  especial thoughts of that age looked back with a keen, regretful wonder  into the gulf of forgetfulness.    But, presently, I turned from the haze and pain of my dream-memories,  once more to the inconceivable mystery of the Night Land, which I viewed  through the great embrasure. For on none did it ever come with weariness  to look out upon all the hideous mysteries; so that old and young  watched, from early years to death, the black monstrosity of the Night  Land, which this our last refuge of humanity held at bay.    To the right of the Red Pit there lay a long, sinuous glare, which I  knew as the Vale of Red Fire, and beyond that for many dreary miles the  blackness of the Night Land; across which came the coldness of the light  from the Plain of Blue Fire.    And then, on the very borders of the Unknown Lands, there lay a range of  low volcanoes, which lit up, far away in the outer darkness, the Black  Hills, where shone the Seven Lights, which neither twinkled nor moved  nor faltered through Eternity; and of which even the great spy-glass  could make no understanding; nor had any adventurer from the Pyramid  ever come back to tell us aught of them. And here let me say, that down  in the Great Library of the Redoubt, were the histories of all those,  with their discoveries, who had ventured out into the monstrousness of  the Night Land, risking not the life only, but the spirit of life.    And surely it is all so strange and wonderful to set out, that I could  almost despair with the contemplation of that which I must achieve; for  there is so much to tell, and so few words given to man by which he may  make clear that which lies beyond the sight and the present and general  knowings of Peoples.    How shall you ever know, as I know in verity, of the greatness and  reality and terror of the thing that I would tell plain to all; for we,  with our puny span of recorded life must have great histories to tell,  but the few bare details we know concerning years that are but a few  thousands in all; and I must set out to you in the short pages of this  my life there, a sufficiency of the life that had been, and the life  that was, both within and without that mighty Pyramid, to make clear to  those who may read, the truth of that which I would tell; and the  histories of that great Redoubt dealt not with odd thousands of years;  but with very millions; aye, away back into what they of that Age  conceived to be the early days of the earth, when the sun, maybe, still  gloomed dully in the night sky of the world. But of all that went  before, nothing, save as myths, and matters to be taken most cautiously,  and believed not by men of sanity and proved wisdom.    And I, ...how shall I make all this clear to you who may read? The thing  cannot be; and yet I must tell my history; for to be silent before so  much wonder would be to suffer of too full a heart; and I must even ease  my spirit by this my struggle to tell to all how it was with me, and how  it will be. Aye, even to the memories which were the possession of that  far future youth, who was indeed I, of his childhood's days, when his  nurse of that Age swung him, and crooned impossible lullabies of this  mythical sun which, according to those future fairy-tales, had once  passed across the blackness that now lay above the Pyramid.    Such is the monstrous futureness of this which I have seen through the  body of that far-off youth.    And so back to my telling.

Holly. Four males, four females. Many plants, like many  animals, are furnished with arms for their protection; these are either  aculei, prickles, as in rose and barberry, which are formed from the  outer bark of the plant; or spinae, thorns, as in hawthorn, which are an  elongation of the wood, and hence more difficult to be torn off than the  former; or stimuli, stings, as in the nettles, which are armed with a  venomous fluid for the annoyance of naked animals. The shrubs and trees,  which have prickles or thorns, are grateful food to many animals, as  goosberry, and gorse; and would be quickly devoured, if not thus armed;  the stings seem a protection against some kinds of insects, as well  as the naked mouths of quadrupeds. Many plants lose their thorns by  cultivation, as wild animals lose their ferocity; and some of them  their horns. A curious circumstance attends the large hollies in  Needwood-forest, they are armed with thorny leaves about eight feet  high, and have smooth leaves above; as if they were conscious that  horses and cattle could not reach their upper branches. See note on  Meadia, and on Mancinella. The numerous clumps of hollies in  Needwood-forest serve as landmarks to direct the travellers  across it in various directions; and as a shelter to the deer and cattle  in winter; and in scarce seasons supply them with much food. For when the  upper branches, which are without prickles, are cut down, the deer crop  the leaves and peel off the bark. The bird-lime made from the bark of  hollies seems to be a very similar material to the elastic gum, or Indian  rubber, as it is called. There is a fossile elastic bitumen found at  Matlock in Derbyshire, which much resembles these substances in its  elasticity and inflammability. The thorns of the mimosa cornigere  resemble cow's horns in appearance as well as in use.

Mr. Adanson says the diameter of the trunk frequently  exceeds 25 feet, and the horizontal branches are from 45 to 55 feet long,  and so large that each branch is equal to the largest trees of Europe.  The breadth of the top is from 120 to 150 feet. And one of the roots  bared only in part by the wasting away of the earth by the river, near  which it grew, measured 110 feet long; and yet these stupendous trees  never exceed 70 feet in height.

Tulip. What is in common language called a bulbous  root, is by Linneus termed the Hybernacle, or Winter-lodge of the young  plant. As these bulbs in every respect resemble buds, except in their  being produced under ground, and include the leaves and flower in  miniature, which are to be expanded in the ensuing spring. By cautiously  cutting in the early spring through the concentric coats of a  tulip-root, longitudinally from the top to the base, and taking them off  successively, the whole flower of the next summer's tulip is beautifully  seen by the naked eye, with its petals, pistil, and stamens; the flowers  exist in other bulbs, in the same manner, as in Hyacinths, but the  individual flowers of these being less, they are not so easily differed,  or so conspicuous to the naked eye.    In the seeds of the Nymphaea Nelumbo, the leaves of the plant are seen  so distinctly, that Mr. Ferber found out by them to what plant the seeds  belonged. Amoen. Acad. V. vi. No. 120. He says that Mariotte first  observed the future flower and foliage in the bulb of a Tulip; and adds,  that it is pleasant to see in the buds of the Hepatica, and Pedicularia  hirsuta, yet lying in the earth; and in the gems of Daphne Mezereon;  and at the base of Osmunda Lunaria, a perfect plant of the future year  compleat in all its parts.

[_Colchicum autumnale_. I. 214. Autumnal Meadow-saffron. Six males,  three females. The germ is buried within the root, which thus seems  to constitute a part of the flower. Families of Plants, p. 242 These  singular flowers appear in the autumn without any leaves, whence in some  countries they are called Naked Ladies: in the March following the green  leaves spring up, and in April the seed-vessel rises from the ground; the  seeds ripen in May, contrary to the usual habits of vegetables, which  slower in the spring, and ripen their seeds in the autumn. Miller's Dict.  The juice of the root of this plant is so acrid as to produce violent  effects on the human constitution, which also prevents it from being  eaten by subterranean insects, and thus guards the seed-vessel during the  winter. The defoliation of deciduous trees is announced by the flowering  of the Colchicum; of these the ash is the last that puts forth its  leaves, and the first that loses them. Phil. Bot. p. 275.    The Hamamelis, Witch Hazle, is another plant which flowers in autumn;  when the leaves fall off, the flowers come out in clusters from the  joints of the branches, and in Virginia ripen their seed in the ensuing  spring; but in this country their seeds seldom ripen.
