At times, the crude  paper contains too many earthy ingredients which impair the cohesion  of the felted fibrous substance, and which especially the carbonate of  lime is very injurious, as it readily effects the decomposition of the  coal tar. The percentage of wool, upon which the durability of the  paper depends very largely, is very small in some of the paper found  in the market. In place of woolen rags, cheap substitutes have been  used, such as waste, which contains vegetable fibers. Since this  cannot resist the decomposition process for any length of time, it is  evident that the roofing paper which contains a noticeable quantity of  vegetable fibers cannot be very durable. To judge from the endeavors  made to improve the coal tar, it may be concluded that this material  does not fully comply with its function of making the roofing paper  perfectly and durably waterproof. The coal tar, be it either crude or  distilled, is not a perfect impregnating material, and the roofing  paper, saturated with it, possesses several defects. Let us in the  following try to ascertain their shortcomings, and then express our  idea in what manner the roofing paper may be improved. It was  previously mentioned that every tar roofing paper will, after a  greater or smaller lapse of time, assume a dry, porous, friable  condition, caused by the volatilization of a part of the constituents  of the tar. This alteration is materially assisted by the oxygen of  the air, which causes the latter to become resinous and exerts a  chemical influence upon them. By the volatilization of the lighter tar  oils, pores are generated between the fibers of the roofing paper,  into which the air and humidity penetrate. In consequence of the  greatly enlarged surface, not only the solid ingredients of the tar,  which still remain unaltered, are exposed to the action of the oxygen,  but also the fibers of the roofing paper are exposed to decomposition.  How destructive the alternating influence of the oxygen and the  atmospheric precipitations are for the roofing paper will be shown by  the following results of tests. It will have been observed that the  rain water running from an old paper roof, especially after dry  weather, has a yellowish, sometimes a brown yellow color. The  supposition that this colored rain water might contain decomposition  products of the roofing paper readily prompted itself, and it has been  collected and analyzed at different seasons of the year. After a  period of several weeks of fair weather during the summer, rain fell,  and the sample of water running from a roof was caught and evaporated;  the residue when dried weighed 1.68 grammes. It was of a brownish  black color, fusible in heat and readily soluble, with a yellow brown  color in water. The dark brown substance readily dissolved in ammonia,  alcohol, dilute acid, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, and  decomposed in nitric acid, but did not dissolve in benzine or fat oil.  After several days' rain during the summer, a quantity of the water  was caught, evaporated, and the residue dried. Its characteristics  were similar to those above mentioned. By an experiment instituted in  water under conditions similar to the first mentioned, the dry brown  substance weighed 71 grammes. It possessed the same characteristics.  In the solution effected with water containing some aqua ammonia of  the brown substance, a white precipitate of oxalate of lime occurred  when an oxalate of ammonia solution was added, but the brown substance  remained in solution. A further precipitation of oxalate of lime was  produced by a solution of oxalic acid, but the brown organic substance  remained in solution. This organic substance being liberated from the  lime was evaporated, and left a dry, resinous, fusible brownish black  substance, which also dissolved readily in water. It will be seen from  these trials that the substance obtained from the rain water running  from a paper roof is a combination of an organic acid with lime, which  readily dissolves in water, and that also the free organic acid  combined with the lime dissolves easily in water.    The question concerning the origin of this organic substance or its  combination with lime can only be answered in one way, viz., that it  must have been washed by the rain water out of the paper. But since  such a solid substance, easily soluble in water, is contained neither  in the fresh roofing paper nor in the coal tar, the only deduction is  that it must have arisen by the decomposition of the tar, in  consequence of the operation of the oxygen. The lime comes from the  coating substance of the roof, for which tar mixed with coal pitch was  used. The latter was fused with carbonate of lime. These analyses  furthermore show that the formation of the organic acid easily soluble  in water depends upon the season; and that a larger quantity of it is  generated in warm, sunny weather than in cold, without sunshine. This  peculiarity of the solid, resinous constituents of the coal tar, to be  by the operation of the atmospheric oxygen altered into such products  that are readily soluble in water, makes the tar very unsuitable as a  saturative substance for a roofing paper. How rapidly a paper roof can  be ruined by the generation of this injurious organic acid will be  seen from the following calculation: Let us suppose that an average  of 132 gallons of rain water falls upon ten square feet roof surface  per year, and that the arithmetical mean 0.932 of the largest (1.680)  and smallest number (0.184) be the quantity of the soluble brown  substance which on an average is dissolved in one quart of rain water;  hence from ten square feet of roof surface are rinsed away with the  rain water per year 466 grammes of the soluble decomposition products  of the tar. The oxidation process will not always occur as intensely  as by a paper roof, ten years old and painted two years ago, which  instigated above described experiment. As long as the roofing paper is  fresh and less porous, especially if the occurring pores are filled  and closed again by repeated coatings, oxidation will take place far  less rapidly. Besides this, the protective coating applied to the roof  surface is exposed most to this oxidation process. Even by assuming  this constantly progressive destructive action of the oxygen on the  roofing paper to be much less than above stated, we can readily  imagine that it must be quite large. If it is desired to produce a  material free of faults, it is first of all indispensable that  unobjectionable raw material be procured. Coal tar was formerly used  almost exclusively for the coating of a roof. It was heated and  applied hot upon the surface. In order to avoid the running off of the  thinly fluid mass, the freshly coated surface was strewn with sand.  The most volatile portion of the tar evaporated soon, whereby the  coating became thicker and finally dried. The bad properties of the  coal tar, pointed out elsewhere, made it very unsuitable even for this  purpose, and experiments were instituted to compound mixtures, by  adding other ingredients to the tar, that should more fully comply  with its function. It may be said in general that the coating masses  for roofs can be divided into two classes: either as lacquers or as  cements. To the former may be classed those of a fairly thinly fluid  consistency, and which contain volatile oils in such quantities that  they will dry quickly. Cements are those of a thickly fluid  consistency, and are rendered thus fluid by heating. It is not  necessary that the coating applied should harden quickly, as it  assumes soon after its application a firmness sufficient to prevent it  from running off the roof. Coal tar is to be classed among lacquers.  If it has been liberated by distillation from the volatile oils, it is  made better suited for the purpose than the ordinary kind. The mass  contains much more asphaltum, and after drying, which takes place  soon, it leaves a far thicker layer upon the roof surface, while the  pores, which had formed in the roofing paper consequent on drying, are  better filled up. Nevertheless, the distilled tar also has retained  the property of drying with time into a hard, vitreous mass, and  ultimately to be destroyed by decomposition.--_The Roofer_.           *       *       *       *       *          A PHYSICAL LABORATORY INDICATOR.      The difficulties attending the management of a physical laboratory are  much greater than those of a chemical one. The cause of this lies in the  fact that in the latter the apparatus is less complicated and the pieces  less varied. Any contrivance that will reduce the labor and worry  connected with the running of a laboratory is valuable.    A physical laboratory may be arranged in several ways. The apparatus may  be kept in a store room and such as is needed may be given to the  student each day and removed after the experiments are performed; or the  apparatus for each experiment or system of experiments may be kept in a  fixed place in the laboratory ready for assembling; for certain  experiments the apparatus may be kept in a fixed place in the laboratory  and permanently arranged for service.    Each student may have his own desk and apparatus or he may be required  to pass from desk to desk. The latter method is preferable.    When a store room is used the services of a man are required to  distribute and afterward to collect. If the apparatus is permanently  distributed, a large room is necessary, but the labor of collecting and  distributing is done away with.    There are certain general experiments intended to show the use of  measuring instruments which all students must perform. To illustrate the  use of the indicator I have selected an elementary class, although the  instrument is equally applicable to all classes of experiments.

This  man was Henry Boyd, a Kentucky freedman, who had helped to overcome the  prejudice against colored mechanics in that city by exhibiting the  highest efficiency. He patented a corded bed which became very popular,  especially in the Southwest. With this article he built up a creditable  manufacturing business, employing from 18 to 25 white and colored  men.[61] He was, therefore, known as one of the desirable men of the  city. Two things, however, seemingly interfered with his business. In  the first place, certain white men, who became jealous of his success,  burned him out and the insurance companies refused to carry him any  longer. Moreover, having to do chiefly with white men he was charged by  his people with favoring the miscegenation of races. Whether or not this  was well founded is not yet known, but his children and grandchildren  did marry whites and were lost in the so-called superior race.    A much more interesting Negro appeared in Cincinnati, however, in 1847.  This was Robert Gordon, formerly the slave of a rich yachtsman of  Richmond, Virginia. His master turned over to him a coal yard which he  handled so faithfully that his owner gave him all of the slack resulting  from the handling of the coal. This he sold to the local manufacturers  and blacksmiths of the city, accumulating thereby in the course of time  thousands of dollars. He purchased himself in 1846 and set out for free  soil. He went first to Philadelphia and then to Newburyport, but finding  that these places did not suit him, he proceeded to Cincinnati. He  arrived there with $15,000, some of which he immediately invested in the  coal business in which he had already achieved marked success. He  employed bookkeepers, had his own wagons, built his own docks on the  river, and bought coal by barges.[62]    Unwilling to see this Negro do so well, the white coal dealers  endeavored to force him out of the business by lowering the price to the  extent that he could not afford to sell. They did not know of his acumen  and the large amount of capital at his disposal. He sent to the coal  yards of his competitors mulattoes who could pass for white, using them  to fill his current orders from his foes' supplies that he might save  his own coal for the convenient day. In the course of a few months the  river and all the canals by which coal was brought to Cincinnati froze  up and remained so until spring. Gordon was then able to dispose of his  coal at a higher price than it had ever been sold in that city. This so  increased his wealth and added to his reputation that no one thereafter  thought of opposing him.    Gordon continued in the coal business until 1865 when he retired. During  the Civil War he invested his money in United States bonds. When these  bonds were called in, he invested in real estate on Walnut Hills, which  he held until his death in 1884. This estate descended to his daughter  Virginia Ann Gordon who married George H. Jackson, a descendant of  slaves in the Custis family of Arlington, Virginia. Mr. Jackson is now a  resident of Chicago and is managing this estate.[63] Having lived  through the antebellum and subsequent periods, Mr. Jackson has been made  to wonder whether the Negroes of Cincinnati are doing as well to-day as  Gordon and his colaborers were. This question requires some attention,  but an inquiry as to exactly what forces have operated to impede the  progress of a work so auspiciously begun would lead us beyond the limits  set for this dissertation.

THE STORY OF MARIA LOUISE MOORE AND FANNIE M. RICHARDS[1]        The State of Virginia has been the home of distinguished persons of both  sexes of the white and colored races. A dissertation on the noted  colored women of Virginia would find a small circle of readers but  would, nevertheless, contain interesting accounts of some of the most  important achievements of the people of that State. The story of Maria  Louise Moore-Richards would be a large chapter of such a narrative. She  was born of white and Negro parentage in Fredericksburg, Virginia, in  1800. Her father was Edwin Moore, a Scotchman of Edinburgh. Her mother  was a free woman of color, born in Toronto when it was called York.  Exactly how they came to Fredericksburg is not known. It seems, however,  that they had been well established in that city when Maria Louise Moore  was born.    This woman was fortunate in coming into the world at that time. So  general had been the efforts for the elevation of the colored people  that free Negroes had many of the privileges later given only to white  people. Virginia then and for a long time thereafter ranked among the  commonwealths most liberal toward the Negro. The dissemination of  information among them was not then restricted, private teaching of  slaves was common, and progressive communities maintained colored  schools.[1a] In Fredericksburg such opportunities were not rare.
