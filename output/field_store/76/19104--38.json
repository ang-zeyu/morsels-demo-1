In this  department, Thorwaldsen is unexceptionably to be admired. The Triumph  of Alexander, originally intended for the frieze of the government  palace at Milan, notwithstanding an occasional poverty, in the  materials of thought, is, as a whole, one of the grandest compositions  in the world; while the delicacy of execution, and poetic feeling, in  the two exquisite pieces of Night and Aurora, leave scarcely a wish  here ungratified. But in statues, Thorwaldsen excels only where the  forms and sentiment admit of uncontrolled imagination, or in which no  immediate recourse can be had to fixed standards of taste, and to the  simple effects of nature. Hence, of all his works, as admitting of  unconfined expression, and grand peculiarity of composition, the  statues of the Apostles, considered in themselves, are the most  excellent. Thorwaldsen, in fine, possesses singular, but in some  respects erratic genius. His ideas of composition are irregular; his  powers of fancy surpass those of execution; his conceptions seem to  lose a portion of their value and freshness in the act of realizement.  As an individual artist, he will command deservedly a high rank among  the names that shall go down to posterity. As a sculptor, who will  influence, or has extended the principles of the art, his pretensions  are not great; or, should this influence and these claims not be thus  limited, the standard of genuine and universal excellence must be  depreciated in a like degree.--_Meme's History of Sculpture, &c._           *       *       *       *       *      SIGN OF THE TIMES.      One of the singularities of the time is an unwillingness to tell the  truth, even when there is no ground for suppressing or perverting it.  It is so frequently under or overstated by most persons in this  country who speak and write, according to the side they have espoused,  or the inclinations and political principles of those by whom they are  likely to be read or heard, that they at last persuade themselves  there is a sort of impropriety in presenting facts in their proper  colours.--_Quarterly Review_.           *       *       *       *       *      A DUTCH TALE.      A ballad of _Roosje_ is perhaps the most touchingly told story  which the Dutch possess. It is of a maid--a beloved maid--born  at her mother's death--bred up 'midst the tears and kisses of her  father--prattling thoughtlessly about her mother--every one's  admiration for beauty, cleverness, and virtue--gentle as the moon  shining on the downs. Her name was to be seen written again and again  on the sands by the Zeeland youths--and scarcely a beautiful flower  bloomed but was gathered for her. Now in Zeeland, when the south-winds  of summer come, there comes too a delicate fish, which hides itself in  the sand, and which is dug out as a luxury by the young people. It is  the time of sport and gaiety--and they venture far--far over the flat  coast into the sea. The boys drag the girls among the waves--and  Roosje was so dragged, notwithstanding many appeals. \"A kiss, a kiss,  or you go further,\" cried her conductor--she fled--he followed, both  laughing:--\"Into the sea--into the sea,\" said all her companions--he  pushes her on--it is deeper, and deeper--she shrieks--she sinks--they  sink together--the sands were faithless--there was no succour--the  waves rolled over them--there was stillness and death:--The terrified  playmates looked--      \"All silently,--they look'd again--      And silently sped home--    And every heart was bursting then,      But every tongue was dumb.      \"And still and stately o'er the wave,      The mournful moon arose,    Flinging pale beams upon the grave,      Where they in peace repose.      \"The wind glanc'd o'er the voiceless sea,      The billows kissed the strand--    And one sad dirge of misery      Fill'd all the mourning land.\"    _Foreign Quarterly Review_.             *       *       *       *       *      ENGLAND AND HER COLONIES.      The discouragement of colonization is certainly not the feeling of the  great majority of the people of England, and it is equally certain  that it is not the policy of this empire. Whatever may be the fate of  the several British colonies at some future and distant period, it is  something at least to have spread our laws and language, and moral  character, over the most distant parts of the globe. The colonies that  speak the language of Old England--that preserve her manners and her  habits--will always be her best customers; and their surplus capital  will always centre in the mother country. It was not the opinion of  our ancestors, that colonies were an incumbrance; they--good, stupid  souls--imagined that colonies enlarged the sphere of commerce---that  commerce required ships--that ships created seamen for manning the  royal navy, and that the whole contributed to individual wealth, to  the national revenue, and the national strength; and such we believe  still to be the opinion of men of sound practical knowledge, whose  minds are unwarped by abstract systems and preconceived theories, to  which every thing must be made to bend. Such, too, was the feeling of  that extraordinary man, who, with the solitary exception of England,  exacted homage from every crowned head of Europe. This man, in the  plenitude of his power, felt that something was still wanting to  enable him to grapple with one little island, invulnerable by its  maritime strength, the sinews of which he knew to be derived from its  colonies: he felt that, deprived as he was of \"ships, colonies, and  commerce,\" England was able to stand alone among nations, and to bid  defiance to his overwhelming power. That cunning fox, too, by whose  councils he was occasionally guided, knew too well the degree of  strength that England derived from her colonies, which he described to  be her very vitals, and which could only be reached by a powerful  navy. He designated them as the sheet anchor of Great Britain--the  prop that supported her maritime superiority--the strongholds of her  power. \"Deprive her of her colonies,\" said Talleyrand. \"and you break  down her last wall; you fill up her last ditch.\"--_Fas est et ab hoste  doceri.--Quarterly Review_.           *       *       *       *       *      INVITATIONS.      As a certificate of your intention to be punctual, you may send your  friends, a similar billet to the following:--    My dear Sir,    The honour of your company is requested to dine with ---- on _Fry_day,  1828.    The favour of a positive answer is requested, or the proffered plate  will be appropriated as it was when--    _Sir Ill-bred Ignorance_ returned the following answer:--\"I shall be  quite happy to come if I possibly can.\" Such words the committee voted  were equivalent to these--I'll come, if in the mean time I am not  invited to a party that I like better.--_Dr. Kitchiner_.           *       *       *       *       *      GENEVA      Has very little, as a city, to recommend it. It is characterized by  much active industry within doors, the _savans_ and _mechaniciens_  being pent up in their closets and ateliers, and very little gaiety  pervades the promenades. Some parts of the town are sufficiently  picturesque; the overhanging roofs, for which it is remarkable, are,  however, too lofty to screen the pedestrian from the rain, especially  if accompanied by a high wind, and form no shade from the sun. The  pavement of the streets is bad, and their irregularity is a  considerable drawback from the internal appearance. The pavement of  the inclined plane in the Hotel de Ville, by which we gain the arduous  ascent that conducts to the Passport office, is a curiosity of its  kind, and perhaps unique. The city is tolerably well fenced in with  walls within walls, draw and suspension bridges, and gates; while  stakes and chains secure from surprise on the part of the lake. The  small canton of Geneva, though in the vicinity of the Great Alpine  chain and the mountains of the Jura, includes no mountains. The name  of the city and canton has been traced by the etymologists to a Celtic  origin; _Gen_, a sally-port or exit, and _av_, a river, probably  because the Rhone here leaves the Leman lake. The eagle on the  escutcheon of the city arms indicates its having been an _imperial_  city; and it is believed the key was an adjunct of Pope Martin V., in  the year 1418. The motto on the scroll, \"Ex tenebris lux,\" appears to  have existed anterior to the _light_ of the Reformation. The number of  inhabitants may now be estimated at about 22,000; but it appears, by a  census in 1789, to have been 26,148. In this moral city, it is  computed that every twelfth birth is illegitimate. The number of  people engaged in clock and watch-making and jewellery, may be safely  rated at 3,000. In years favourable to these staple manufactures  75,000 ounces of gold are employed, which is almost equally divided  between watches and jewellery. The daily supply of silver is about 134  ounces. Pearls form an article of considerable value in the jewellery,  and have been rated at no less a sum that 1,200 francs daily. 70,000  watches are annually made, only one-twelfth of which are in silver.  More than fifty distinct branches are comprised in the various  departments, and each workman, on the average, earns about three  shillings a-day.--_Mr. John Murray's Tour_.           *       *       *       *       *      HANDEL.      Some folks eat two or three times as much as others--for instance, our  incomparable and inspired composer, Handel, required uncommonly large  and frequent supplies of food.

Spatolino conducted him a little beyond the gate of Civita  Vecchia, and giving him two thrusts of his stiletto in his heart, cut  off his ears and nose, to carry them as a present to his wife, and then  departed immediately for Sonnino. On his arrival, he proceeded to seek  Mary and his band. After the usual salutations, he took out of his  pocket the small bundle containing the nose and ears of the sailor, and,  presenting them to his wife, said, \"From this you may judge my  affection. I was desirous of avenging your wrongs, and have done so by  killing your seducer. Here are the pledges of it, which you should keep,  in order to remind you of the betrayer, and as a guard against future  temptation. You cannot mistrust me, when I promise ever to afford you  proofs of true attachment, and I hope you will be faithful to me!\" After  this they embraced affectionately, and swore to each other eternal  fidelity. Nor is it possible for any man to have kept his word more  scrupulously towards his wife. The following day Spatolino departed at  the head of his band, which was composed of eighteen persons, himself  and wife included, and proceeded to the vicinity of Portatta, near the  main road leading from Rome to Naples, which at that time was much  frequented by the French of every rank and condition, who proceeded  under orders between these two places. Towards night, Spatolino placed  himself and comrades in ambush on the high road, intending to take  advantage of a military body of which he had information. Ere long a  sound of horses was heard; they were immediately on the alert, and  succeeded in arresting a French escort of seven soldiers on foot, and  the same number on horseback, conducting the baggage-wagon of a French  colonel of the line. It contained all his effects, and money to a large  amount. Upon the first fire of Spatolino's band, five of the soldiers  were killed, and three desperately wounded; he then threw himself  amongst the others, who were placed on the defence, and who had expended  their fire without hurting a single individual of the band. Spatolino,  with his pistols, killed two, and a few moments saw him and his band  masters of the field. Spatolino ordered his men to strip the dead, and  placing every thing in the wagon, after digging a pit for the bodies,  they retired to a cave in a wood near the road, where the booty was  equally divided. He took himself two of the best horses, and armed and  equipped his band in a superior manner. He also presented to his wife a  part of the spoil, she having been armed in the action, performing the  duty of a sentinel on the highway in advance about half a mile off, to  give notice, in case of an overwhelming force appearing. Spatolino,  having made a fair division of the spoil to raise the courage of his  companions, sent all his own money to his parents, informing them at the  same time, that for the future they should be released from misery, as  he would ever bear in mind the beings who gave him birth.--_New Monthly  Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *      AN UNINSURABLE RISK.        A bookseller opened a shop on the coast,      (I'd rather not mention the spot,)    Where gentlemen lounged o'er the Herald and Post,      And ladies read Byron and Scott.      Much personal memoir, too, shone on the shelves,      Which boasted a whimsical olio;    Decorum sang small, in octavoes and twelves,      And scandal in quarto and folio.

On few subjects are the public under more misapprehension than on the  absolute and relative circulation of several portions of the London  daily press. The greater part of the people would startle were they told  that The Times circulates probably under 7,000 a day on an average; the  paper is seen, as one may say, in every pot-house in London, and all  over the country; and yet this is all its number.    The property of a paper is a matter of which most people have a very  vague and imperfect knowledge. I believe I am very near the truth when I  state the gross proceeds of The Times at 45,000l., a year. The present  proprietor of The Morning Chronicle gave for it, I believe, 40,000l. The  absolute property of The Courier, according to the current rate of its  shares, is between 90,000l. and 100,000l. Estimating the value of The  Globe on the same scale, the absolute property of it is probably  somewhere about 35,000l. The profits of a paper arise almost entirely  out of its advertisements, and hence the difference in value between the  two last, notwithstanding their circulation is so nearly equal. A  newspaper gets its advertisements by degrees, and, as it is supposed by  the public, its numbers increase; but it retains them long after the  cause by which they were acquired has vanished. It is thus that The  Courier, which got its advertisements when it basked in all the sunshine  of ministerial patronage, retains these when its numbers are reduced by  one-half, and the countenance of government is no longer held out to it.    These, however, it must be admitted, are the prizes in the lottery of  newspaper speculation: and in this, as in every other lottery, there are  more blanks than prizes. Mr. Murray, after having expended upwards of  10,000l. on his Representative, sold it to the proprietors of The New  Times for about 600l.: and The British Press, after having ruined I know  not how many capitalists, was sold to the same concern for, I believe, a  considerably smaller sum.--_London Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *      MADEMOISELLE CUVIER.      Mademoiselle Cuvier, daughter of the celebrated naturalist, died a short  time since at Paris. There has seldom been any instance where the  strongest benevolence was so closely united to the charms of intellect.  She possessed a rare mixture of elevation of mind and firmness of  character--of strength and equanimity--sweetness and simplicity. It was  truly gratifying to witness her worship, or rather superstition, for  truth, and to watch the avidity with which she used to seize and  illustrate whatever she thought likely to remove ignorance, or promote  the cause of virtue and freedom. The circumstances which attended the  death of this amiable creature, have, if possible, greatly augmented the  grief of her family and friends. The day of her nuptials was fixed, and  she was to be united to a man of her own choice, and everything was  prepared for the ceremony. Being suddenly afflicted by rapid symptoms of  consumption, all hopes of her recovery soon vanished. Notwithstanding,  the ball dresses, veils, and shawls, continued to be sent home to the  unhappy parents, who dared not refuse them, lest they should themselves  be accused of giving way to despair. This mixture of preparations for  rejoicing, and the certainty of death, formed a picture the most  melancholy and pathetic. When the fatal moment arrived, her family and  many friends surrounded the dying couch in mournful silence. The funeral  was attended by all that is distinguished for rank and fortune at Paris;  a clergyman of the Protestant church read the service for the dead, and  a funeral sermon. A number of young females whom she had formed for  succouring the poor, were ranged round the bier, dressed in white, and  followed to the Cemetery of Pere la Chaise, where M. Salvandy, one of  her friends, undertook to deliver the final eulogy, which it is usual in  France to pronounce on departed worth.--_Monthly Magazine_.--_Letter  from Paris_.           *       *       *       *       *      HOW TO LOSE TIME.      Few men need complain of the want of time, if they are not conscious of  a want of power, or of desire to ennoble and enjoy it. Perhaps you are a  man of genius yourself, gentle reader, and though not absolutely, like  Sir Walter, a witch, warlock, or wizard, still a poet--a maker--a  creator. Think, then, how many hours on hours you have lost, lying  asleep so profoundly,     \"That the cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,    No more could rouse you from your lazy bed.\"    How many more have you, not absolutely lost, but to a certain extent  abused, at breakfast--sip, sipping away at unnecessary cups of sirupy  tea, or gob, gobbling away at jam-buttered rolls, for which nature never  called--or \"to party giving up what was meant for mankind\"--forgetting  the loss of Time in the Times, and, after a long, blank, brown, and blue  study, leaving behind you a most miserable chronicle indeed! Then  think--O think--on all your aimless forenoon saunterings--round and  round about the premises--up and down the avenue--then into the garden  on tiptoe--in and out among the neat squares of onion-beds--now humming  a tune by the brink of abysses of mould, like trenches dug for the slain  in the field of battle, where the tender celery is laid--now down to the  river-side to try a little angling, though you well know there is  nothing to be had but Pars--now into a field of turnips, without your  double-barreled Joe Manton, (at Mr. Wilkinson's to be repaired,) to see  Ponto point a place where once a partridge had pruned himself--now home  again, at the waving of John's red sleeve, to receive a coach-full of  country cousins, come in the capacity of forenoon callers--endless  talkers all--sharp and blunt noses alike--and grinning voraciously in  hopes of a lunch--now away to dress for dinner, which will not be for  two long, long"]]]
