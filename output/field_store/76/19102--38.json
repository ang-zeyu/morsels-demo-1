His manner was kind, attentive, and humane. His eye was full of  animation; but there was a grave and sad solemnity in his air, which,  for want of experience, I imagined was the inheritance of the great, and  the instrument by which the distance between them and their inferiors  was maintained. His look bespoke the unquietness of his mind, and  frequently wandered with an expression of disconsolateness and anxiety.    My reception was as gracious and encouraging as I could possibly desire.  Mr. Falkland questioned me respecting my learning, and my conceptions of  men and things, and listened to my answers with condescension and  approbation. This kindness soon restored to me a considerable part of my  self-possession, though I still felt restrained by the graceful, but  unaltered dignity of his carriage. When Mr. Falkland had satisfied his  curiosity, he proceeded to inform me that he was in want of a secretary,  that I appeared to him sufficiently qualified for that office, and that,  if, in my present change of situation, occasioned by the death of my  father, I approved of the employment, he would take me into his family.    I felt highly flattered by the proposal, and was warm in the expression  of my acknowledgments. I set eagerly about the disposal of the little  property my father had left, in which I was assisted by Mr. Collins. I  had not now a relation in the world, upon whose kindness and  interposition I had any direct claim. But, far from regarding this  deserted situation with terror, I formed golden visions of the station  I was about to occupy. I little suspected that the gaiety and lightness  of heart I had hitherto enjoyed were upon the point of leaving me for  ever, and that the rest of my days were devoted to misery and alarm.    My employment was easy and agreeable. It consisted partly in the  transcribing and arranging certain papers, and partly in writing from my  master's dictation letters of business, as well as sketches of literary  composition. Many of these latter consisted of an analytical survey of  the plans of different authors and conjectural speculations upon hints  they afforded, tending either to the detection of their errors, or the  carrying forward their discoveries. All of them bore powerful marks of a  profound and elegant mind, well stored with literature, and possessed of  an uncommon share of activity and discrimination.    My station was in that part of the house which was appropriated for the  reception of books, it being my duty to perform the functions of  librarian as well as secretary. Here my hours would have glided in  tranquillity and peace, had not my situation included in it  circumstances totally different from those which attended me in my  father's cottage. In early life my mind had been much engrossed by  reading and reflection: my intercourse with my fellow mortals was  occasional and short. But, in my new residence, I was excited by every  motive of interest and novelty to study my master's character; and I  found in it an ample field for speculation and conjecture.    His mode of living was in the utmost degree recluse and solitary. He had  no inclination to scenes of revelry and mirth. He avoided the busy  haunts of men; nor did he seem desirous to compensate for this privation  by the confidence of friendship. He appeared a total stranger to every  thing which usually bears the appellation of pleasure. His features were  scarcely ever relaxed into a smile, nor did that air which spoke the  unhappiness of his mind at any time forsake them: yet his manners were  by no means such as denoted moroseness and misanthropy. He was  compassionate and considerate for others, though the stateliness of his  carriage and the reserve of his temper were at no time interrupted. His  appearance and general behaviour might have strongly interested all  persons in his favour; but the coldness of his address, and the  impenetrableness of his sentiments, seemed to forbid those  demonstrations of kindness to which one might otherwise have been  prompted.    Such was the general appearance of Mr. Falkland: but his disposition was  extremely unequal. The distemper which afflicted him with incessant  gloom had its paroxysms. Sometimes he was hasty, peevish, and  tyrannical; but this proceeded rather from the torment of his mind than  an unfeeling disposition; and when reflection recurred, he appeared  willing that the weight of his misfortune should fall wholly upon  himself. Sometimes he entirely lost his self-possession, and his  behaviour was changed into frenzy: he would strike his forehead, his  brows became knit, his features distorted, and his teeth ground one  against the other. When he felt the approach of these symptoms, he would  suddenly rise, and, leaving the occupation, whatever it was, in which he  was engaged, hasten into a solitude upon which no person dared to  intrude.    It must not be supposed that the whole of what I am describing was  visible to the persons about him; nor, indeed, was I acquainted with it  in the extent here stated but after a considerable time, and in gradual  succession. With respect to the domestics in general, they saw but  little of their master. None of them, except myself, from the nature of  my functions, and Mr. Collins, from the antiquity of his service and the  respectableness of his character, approached Mr. Falkland, but at stated  seasons and for a very short interval. They knew him only by the  benevolence of his actions, and the principles of inflexible integrity  by which he was ordinarily guided; and though they would sometimes  indulge their conjectures respecting his singularities, they regarded  him upon the whole with veneration, as a being of a superior order.    One day, when I had been about three months in the service of my patron,  I went to a closet, or small apartment, which was separated from the  library by a narrow gallery that was lighted by a small window near the  roof. I had conceived that there was no person in the room, and intended  only to put any thing in order that I might find out of its place. As I  opened the door, I heard at the same instant a deep groan, expressive of  intolerable anguish. The sound of the door in opening seemed to alarm  the person within; I heard the lid of a trunk hastily shut, and the  noise as of fastening a lock. I conceived that Mr. Falkland was there,  and was going instantly to retire; but at that moment a voice, that  seemed supernaturally tremendous, exclaimed, Who is there? The voice was  Mr. Falkland's. The sound of it thrilled my very vitals. I endeavoured  to answer, but my speech failed, and being incapable of any other reply,  I instinctively advanced within the door into the room. Mr. Falkland was  just risen from the floor upon which he had been sitting or kneeling.  His face betrayed strong symptoms of confusion. With a violent effort,  however, these symptoms vanished, and instantaneously gave place to a  countenance sparkling with rage.    \"Villain!\" cried he, \"what has brought you here?\" I hesitated a  confused and irresolute answer. \"Wretch!\" interrupted Mr. Falkland, with  uncontrollable impatience, \"you want to ruin me. You set yourself as a  spy upon my actions; but bitterly shall you repent your insolence. Do  you think you shall watch my privacies with impunity?\" I attempted to  defend myself. \"Begone, devil!\" rejoined he. \"Quit the room, or I will  trample you into atoms.\" Saying this, he advanced towards me. But I was  already sufficiently terrified, and vanished in a moment. I heard the  door shut after me with violence; and thus ended this extraordinary  scene.    I saw him again in the evening, and he was then tolerably composed. His  behaviour, which was always kind, was now doubly attentive and soothing.  He seemed to have something of which he wished to disburthen his mind,  but to want words in which to convey it. I looked at him with anxiety  and affection. He made two unsuccessful efforts, shook his head, and  then putting five guineas into my hand, pressed it in a manner that I  could feel proceeded from a mind pregnant with various emotions, though  I could not interpret them. Having done this, he seemed immediately to  recollect himself, and to take refuge in the usual distance and  solemnity of his manner.    I easily understood that secrecy was one of the things expected from me;  and, indeed, my mind was too much disposed to meditate upon what I had  heard and seen, to make it a topic of indiscriminate communication. Mr.  Collins, however, and myself happened to sup together that evening,  which was but seldom the case, his avocations obliging him to be much  abroad. He could not help observing an uncommon dejection and anxiety in  my countenance, and affectionately enquired into the reason. I  endeavoured to evade his questions, but my youth and ignorance of the  world gave me little advantage for that purpose. Beside this, I had been  accustomed to view Mr. Collins with considerable attachment, and I  conceived from the nature of his situation that there could be small  impropriety in making him my confident in the present instance. I  repeated to him minutely every thing that had passed, and concluded with  a solemn declaration that, though treated with caprice, I was not  anxious for myself; no inconvenience or danger should ever lead me to a  pusillanimous behaviour; and I felt only for my patron, who, with every  advantage for happiness, and being in the highest degree worthy of it,  seemed destined to undergo unmerited distress.    In answer to my communication, Mr. Collins informed me that some  incidents, of a nature similar to that which I related, had fallen under  his own knowledge, and that from the whole he could not help concluding  that our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11330"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 10, No. 274, (#5)"],[1,"the wide apartment, and at a board  well covered with smoking viands--haunches of the red deer, bustards,  cranes, quarters of mutton, pasties, the grinning heads of wild boars,--and  flanked with flagons of wine, and tankards of foaming ale, sat King  Stephen, surrounded by the flower of the Norman nobles, whose voices had  placed him on the English throne. In the midst of the feast, the jovial  glee of the wassailers was interrupted by the entrance of a page, who,  forcing his way through the yeomen and lacqueys crowding at the door, flew  with breathless haste to the feet of the king, and falling down on his  knees, in faltering accents delivered the message with which he had been  intrusted. \"Up, gallants,\" exclaimed the martial monarch, \"don your  harness, and ride as lightly as you may to the relief of the Countess of  Clare, she lies in peril of her life and honour, beleaguered by a rabble of  unnurtured Welsh savages, who, lacking respect for beauty, have directed  their arms against a woman. Swollen with vain pride at their late victory,  (the fiend hang the coward loons who fled before them,) they have sworn to  make this noble lady serve them barefoot in their camp. By St. Dennis and  my good sword, were I not hampered by this pestilent invasion of the Scots,  I would desire no better pastime than to drive the ill-conditioned serfs  howling from the walls. Say, who amongst you will undertake the  enterprise?--What, all silent? are ye knights? are ye men? do I reign over  christian warriors, valiant captains who have been sworn to protect beauty  in distress; or are ye like the graceless dogs of Mahomed, insensible to  female honour?\" \"My ranks are wonderous scant,\" returned Milo Fitzwalter,  \"I may not reckon twenty men at arms in the whole train, and varlets have I  none; but it boots not to number spears when danger presses; so to horse  and away. Beshrew me, were it the termagant Queen Maude herself, I'd do my  best to rescue her in this extremity.\"--\"Thou art a true knight,  Fitzwalter,\" replied the king, \"and wilt prosper: the Saint's benizon be  with thee, for thou must speed on this errand with such tall men as thou  canst muster of thine own proper followers: the Scots, whom the devil  confound, leave me too much work, to spare a single lance from mine own  array. We will drink to thy success, and to the health of the fair  countess, in a flask of the right Bourdeaux: and tell the lady that thy  monarch grudges thee this glorious deed; for by my Halidom, an thou winnest  her unscathed from the hands of these Welsh churls, thou wilt merit a niche  beside the most renowned of Charlemagne's paladins.\" Fitzwalter made no  answer, but he armed in haste, and, leaping into his saddle, gave the spur  to his gallant steed, and followed by his esquires and men at arms, rested  not either night or day, until he reached the marches of Wales. The lions  of England still proudly flying over the castle walls, assured him that the  countess had been enabled to hold out against the savage horde, who  surrounded it on all sides. The besiegers set up a furious yell as the  knight and his party approached their encampment. Half naked, their eyes  glaring wildly from beneath a mass of yellow hair, and scantily armed with  the rudest species of offensive and defensive weapons, their numbers alone  made them terrible; and had the castle been manned and victualled, it might  have long defied their utmost strength. Drawing their falchions, the knight  and his party keeping closely together, and thus forming an impenetrable  wedge, cut their desperate path through the fierce swarm of opposing foes,  who, like incarnate demons, rushed to the onslaught, and fell in heaps  before the biting steel of these experienced soldiers. Pressing forward  with unyielding bravery, Fitzwalter won the castle walls; whence, with the  assistance of such frail aid as the living spectres on the battlements  could give, he beat back the Welsh host, and in another quarter of an hour,  having dispersed the enemy with frightful loss, gained free entrance to the  castle. Feeble was the shout of triumph which welcomed Fitzwalter and his  brave companions; the corpses of the unburied dead lay strewed upon the  pavement; the heroic countess, and her attendant damsels, clad in the  armour of the slain, weakened by famine, and hopeless of succour, yet still  striving to deceive the besiegers by the display of living warriors, by  this stratagem retarded the assault which they could not repel. Fitzwalter  took advantage of the darkness of the night, and the panic of the  Welshmen, to withdraw from a fortress which was destitute of all the  implements of war; and with the rescued ladies mounted behind them, the  brave band returned to the court of King Stephen; and the charms of the  fair one, and the valour of her chivalric defender, formed the theme of the  minstrel in every knightly hall and lady's bower throughout Christendom.           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.           *       *       *       *       *      THE CONFESSIONS OF AN ENGLISH NOVEL READER.      How shall I describe the emotions with which I read the first novel I ever  perused! A school-fellow had secretly brought with him from home after the  holidays, the novel of Peregrine Pickle, which he carefully concealed in  his trunk. He at first lent it to some of the elder boys, who read it, and  enlarging on some of the most despicable incidents to be found, disgusted  my meek spirit of it, by their report. It seemed to violate all my  cherished ideas of beauty and soft luxury. I was then about fourteen years  of age, and my companions persuaded me to a perusal. I took it up  listlessly, expecting but little pleasure, but what language can paint the  manner in which I was entranced by it? I read it over and over with  increased delight, my entire soul and frame of mind and passions seemed to  be suddenly changed and remodelled. I forgot Ariadne and Telemachus, and  Tom Pipes and Hatchway became my idols, the undivided objects of my  admiration.    I had hitherto been a remarkably quiet and inoffensive boy; Telemachus I  considered never took delight in robbing orchards. I had the confidence of  my teachers from my uniform rejection of any participation in the rude  affrays, the catastrophe of which dramas was in general an almost universal  flogging match. My admiration naturally led to its probable result, a  desire to imitate--I firmly resolved to become a Peregrine. I soon promoted  myself to be the leader of every mad prank that the wit of a spirit  suddenly excited to activity could devise. In the first fortnight I got  flogged for tying a huge mass of brown paper to the tail of the favourite  cat of the master's lady, with which she rushed with an insane and  terrifying distraction into the drawing-room. We owed a spite to a  neighbouring milkman for tale-bearing, and we rendered his pump, the great  source of profit, useless, by filling it with soot and mire. The old woman  who served the school with tarts, and who, in her endeavours to please all  palates, brought some varieties heated over a charcoal fire, had her  apparatus blown to atoms by an ounce of gunpowder, insinuated with so much  art, that although done before her face, she could attach no one with the  offence. All became riot, waste, and destruction under the guidance of my  beloved Peregrine.    But, ah! the poor Count--amiable, patient, and long-suffering Gaul! He was  an unhappy refugee, who had sought a home, by becoming the reviled,  insulted teacher of his native tongue to a mob of heartless ruffians. How  well do I remember his neat but thread-bare coat and pigtail; his stooping  gait, not the decrepitude of age, but as though it sprang from the  abasement of his fortune; his endurance of injury to a certain point, when  patience suddenly forsook him, and his, to us, irresistibly comic rage and  exasperation! What would that generous seaman Pipes have thought a  defenceless Frenchman fit for, but as the object of spirited and  well-conducted pranks? Nothing cruel or revengeful, but only to show our  own superior wit and address in concerted and premeditated annoyance.    I had gained with a most surprising rapidity upon the confidence of the  most conspicuous rioters in the school. There was something so noble and  daring in all my designs, that they seemed to yield willingly to so  superior a spirit. The sudden alteration in my manners had been noticed  with secret wonder by the masters, and they, thinking to check my fatal  tendencies at the outset, had inflicted on me several severe and  well-merited chastisements. I converted even these into means of extending  my influence. I had borne them like a hero, a very Peregrine. No groan--no  sigh--no bellowing promise of amendment, had lessened my dignity. Under the  torture, I was sullen and silent. The stoutest heart in the school envied  my manhood and composure.    The poor French teacher had been the hereditary object of annoyance for  several generations of boys. The meekest and most chicken-hearted scrubs in  the school tried their apprenticeship to mischief upon him, and were  tutored to more noble game by beginning with the Count. They split and cut  his pens into a thousand fantastic shapes during a momentary absence; they  filled his snuff with the most odious pulverulents. They placed on his desk  rude, but expressive designs of a guillotine, with a meagre fellow in  ruffles and no shirt, running in the extremity of speed from the spot.  These, and a thousand exhibitions of budding genius, and original sin, were  our daily subjects of merriment and applause. I taught them nobler arts, or  rather the spirit of Pickle which spake within me. It was nothing to annoy  on such a petty and momentary scale; let the art and forethought of  Hatchway be exhibited.    The amiable Frenchman was a zealous"]]]
