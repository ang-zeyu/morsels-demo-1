Ah wilds of woe!    The spires of Richmond, late beheld    Through rifts in musket-haze,  Were closed from view in clouds of dust      On leaf-walled ways,  Where streamed our wagons in caravan;    And the Seven Nights and Days  Of march and fast, retreat and fight,  Pinched our grimed faces to ghastly plight--        Does the elm wood  Recall the haggard beards of blood?    The battle-smoked flag, with stars eclipsed,    We followed (it never fell!)--  In silence husbanded our strength--      Received their yell;  Till on this slope we patient turned    With cannon ordered well;  Reverse we proved was not defeat;  But ah, the sod what thousands meet!--        Does Malvern Wood  Bethink itself, and muse and brood?              _We elms of Malvern Hill              Remember every thing;            But sap the twig will fill:            Wag the world how it will,              Leaves must be green in Spring._          The Victor of Antietam.[5]  (1862.)      When tempest winnowed grain from bran;  And men were looking for a man,  Authority called you to the van,          McClellan:  Along the line the plaudit ran,  As later when Antietam's cheers began.    Through storm-cloud and eclipse must move  Each Cause and Man, dear to the stars and Jove;  Nor always can the wisest tell  Deferred fulfillment from the hopeless knell--  The struggler from the floundering ne'er-do-well.  A pall-cloth on the Seven Days fell,          Mcclellan--  Unprosperously heroical!  Who could Antietam's wreath foretell?    Authority called you; then, in mist  And loom of jeopardy--dismissed.  But staring peril soon appalled;  You, the Discarded, she recalled--  Recalled you, nor endured delay;  And forth you rode upon a blasted way,  Arrayed Pope's rout, and routed Lee's array,          McClellan:  Your tent was choked with captured flags that day,          McClellan.  Antietam was a telling fray.    Recalled you; and she heard your drum  Advancing through the glastly gloom.  You manned the wall, you propped the Dome,  You stormed the powerful stormer home,          McClellan:  Antietam's cannon long shall boom.    At Alexandria, left alone,          McClellan--  Your veterans sent from you, and thrown  To fields and fortunes all unknown--  What thoughts were yours, revealed to none,  While faithful still you labored on--  Hearing the far Manassas gun!          McClellan,  Only Antietam could atone.    You fought in the front (an evil day,          McClellan)--  The fore-front of the first assay;  The Cause went sounding, groped its way;  The leadsmen quarrelled in the bay;  Quills thwarted swords; divided sway;  The rebel flushed in his lusty May:  You did your best, as in you lay,          McClellan.  Antietam's sun-burst sheds a ray.    Your medalled soldiers love you well,          McClellan:  Name your name, their true hearts swell;  With you they shook dread Stonewall's spell,[6]  With you they braved the blended yell  Of rebel and maligner fell;  With you in shame or fame they dwell,          McClellan:  Antietam-braves a brave can tell.    And when your comrades (now so few,          McClellan--  Such ravage in deep files they rue)  Meet round the board, and sadly view  The empty places; tribute due  They render to the dead--and you!  Absent and silent o'er the blue;  The one-armed lift the wine to _you_,          McClellan,  And great Antietam's cheers renew.        Battle of Stone River, Tennessee.  A View from Oxford Cloisters.  (January, 1863.)      With Tewksbury and Barnet heath    In days to come the field shall blend,  The story dim and date obscure;    In legend all shall end.  Even now, involved in forest shade    A Druid-dream the strife appears,  The fray of yesterday assumes    The haziness of years.        In North and South still beats the vein        Of Yorkist and Lancastrian.    Our rival Roses warred for Sway--    For Sway, but named the name of Right;  And Passion, scorning pain and death,    Lent sacred fervor to the fight.  Each lifted up a broidered cross,    While crossing blades profaned the sign;  Monks blessed the fraticidal lance,    And sisters scarfs could twine.        Do North and South the sin retain        Of Yorkist and Lancastrian?    But Rosecrans in the cedarn glade,    And, deep in denser cypress gloom,  Dark Breckenridge, shall fade away        Or thinly loom.  The pale throngs who in forest cowed    Before the spell of battle's pause,  Forefelt the stillness that shall dwell    On them and on their wars.        North and South shall join the train        Of Yorkist and Lancastrian.    But where the sword has plunged so deep,    And then been turned within the wound  By deadly Hate; where Climes contend        On vasty ground--  No warning Alps or seas between,    And small the curb of creed or law,  And blood is quick, and quick the brain;    Shall North and South their rage deplore,        And reunited thrive amain        Like Yorkist and Lancastrian?        Running the Batteries,  As observed from the Anchorage above Vicksburgh.  (April, 1863.)      A moonless night--a friendly one;    A haze dimmed the shadowy shore  As the first lampless boat slid silent on;    Hist! and we spake no more;  We but pointed, and stilly, to what we saw.    We felt the dew, and seemed to feel    The secret like a burden laid.  The first boat melts; and a second keel    Is blent with the foliaged shade--  Their midnight rounds have the rebel officers made?    Unspied as yet. A third--a fourth--    Gun-boat and transport in Indian file  Upon the war-path, smooth from the North;    But the watch may they hope to beguile?  The manned river-batteries stretch for mile on mile.    A flame leaps out; they are seen;    Another and another gun roars;  We tell the course of the boats through the screen    By each further fort that pours,  And we guess how they jump from their beds on those shrouded shores.    Converging fires. We speak, though low:    \"That blastful furnace can they thread\"  \"Why, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego    Came out all right, we read;  The Lord, be sure, he helps his people, Ned.\"    How we strain our gaze. On bluffs they shun    A golden growing flame appears--  Confirms to a silvery steadfast one:    \"The town is afire!\" crows Hugh: \"three cheers\"  Lot stops his mouth: \"Nay, lad, better three tears.\"    A purposed light; it shows our fleet;    Yet a little late in its searching ray,  So far and strong, that in phantom cheat    Lank on the deck our shadows lay;  The shining flag-ship stings their guns to furious play.    How dread to mark her near the glare    And glade of death the beacon throws  Athwart the racing waters there;    One by one each plainer grows,  Then speeds a blazoned target to our gladdened foes.    The impartial cresset lights as well    The fixed forts to the boats that run;  And, plunged from the ports, their answers swell    Back to each fortress dun:  Ponderous words speaks every monster gun.    Fearless they flash through gates of flame,    The salamanders hard to hit,  Though vivid shows each bulky frame;    And never the batteries intermit,  Nor the boats huge guns; they fire and flit.    Anon a lull. The beacon dies:    \"Are they out of that strait accurst\"  But other flames now dawning rise,    Not mellowly brilliant like the first,  But rolled in smoke, whose whitish volumes burst.    A baleful brand, a hurrying torch    Whereby anew the boats are seen--  A burning transport all alurch!    Breathless we gaze; yet still we glean  Glimpses of beauty as we eager lean.    The effulgence takes an amber glow    Which bathes the hill-side villas far;  Affrighted ladies mark the show    Painting the pale magnolia--  The fair, false, Circe light of cruel War.    The barge drifts doomed, a plague-struck one.    Shoreward in yawls the sailors fly.  But the gauntlet now is nearly run,    The spleenful forts by fits reply,  And the burning boat dies down in morning's sky.    All out of range. Adieu, Messieurs!    Jeers, as it speeds, our parting gun.  So burst we through their barriers    And menaces every one:  So Porter proves himself a brave man's son.[7]        Stonewall Jackson.  Mortally wounded at Chancellorsville.  (May, 1863.)      The Man who fiercest charged in fight,    Whose sword and prayer were long--            Stonewall!    Even him who stoutly stood for Wrong,  How can we praise? Yet coming days    Shall not forget him with this song.    Dead is the Man whose Cause is dead,    Vainly he died and set his seal--            Stonewall!    Earnest in error, as we feel;  True to the thing he deemed was due,    True as John Brown or steel.    Relentlessly he routed us;    But _we_ relent, for he is low--            Stonewall!    Justly his fame we outlaw; so  We drop a tear on the bold Virginian's bier,    Because no wreath we owe.        Stonewall Jackson.  (Ascribed to a Virginian.)      One man we claim of wrought renown    Which not the North shall care to slur;  A Modern lived who sleeps in death,    Calm as the marble Ancients are:      'Tis he whose life, though a vapor's wreath,      Was charged with the lightning's burning breath--        Stonewall, stormer of the war.    But who shall hymn the roman heart?    A stoic he, but even more:  The iron will and lion thew    Were strong to inflict as to endure:      Who like him could stand, or pursue?      His fate the fatalist followed through;      In all his great soul found to do        Stonewall followed his star.    He followed his star on the Romney march    Through the sleet to the wintry war;  And he followed it on when he bowed the grain--    The Wind of the Shenandoah;      At Gaines's Mill in the giant's strain--      On the fierce forced stride to Manassas-plain,      Where his sword with thunder was clothed again,        Stonewall followed his star.

Above are the clouds and the white, pealing gulls,  At its foot is the rough broken foam of the sea,                          5  With ever anon the long deep muffled roar,--  A sigh from the fitful great heart of the world.    Then inland just where the small meadow begins,  Well bulwarked with boulders that jut in the tide,  Lies safe beyond storm-beat the harbour in sun.                          10    See where the black fishing-boats, each at its buoy,  Ride up on the swell with their dare-danger prows,  To sight o'er the sea-rim what venture may come!    And look, where the narrow white streets of the town  Leap up from the blue water's edge to the wood,                          15  Scant room for man's range between mountain and sea,  And the market where woodsmen from over the hill  May traffic, and sailors from far foreign ports  With treasure brought in from the ends of the earth.    And see the third house on the left, with that gleam                     20  Of red burnished copper--the hinge of the door  Whereat I shall enter, expected so oft  (Let love be your sea-star!), to voyage no more.          LIII      Art thou the top-most apple  The gatherers could not reach,  Reddening on the bough?    Shall not I take thee?    Art thou a hyacinth blossom                                               5  The shepherds upon the hills  Have trodden into the ground?    Shall not I lift thee?    Free is the young god Eros,  Paying no tribute to power,                                              10  Seeing no evil in beauty,    Full of compassion.    Once having found the beloved,  However sorry or woeful,  However scornful of loving,                                              15    Little it matters.          LIV      How soon will all my lovely days be over,  And I no more be found beneath the sun,--  Neither beside the many-murmuring sea,  Nor where the plain-winds whisper to the reeds,  Nor in the tall beech-woods among the hills                               5  Where roam the bright-lipped Oreads, nor along  The pasture-sides where berry-pickers stray  And harmless shepherds pipe their sheep to fold!    For I am eager, and the flame of life  Burns quickly in the fragile lamp of clay.                               10  Passion and love and longing and hot tears  Consume this mortal Sappho, and too soon  A great wind from the dark will blow upon me,  And I be no more found in the fair world,  For all the search of the revolving moon                                 15  And patient shine of everlasting stars.          LV      Soul of sorrow, why this weeping?  What immortal grief hath touched thee  With the poignancy of sadness,--    Testament of tears?    Have the high gods deigned to show thee                                   5  Destiny, and disillusion  Fills thy heart at all things human,    Fleeting and desired?    Nay, the gods themselves are fettered  By one law which links together                                          10  Truth and nobleness and beauty,    Man and stars and sea.    And they only shall find freedom  Who with courage rise and follow  Where love leads beyond all peril,                                       15    Wise beyond all words.          LVI      It never can be mine  To sit in the door in the sun  And watch the world go by,  A pageant and a dream;    For I was born for love,                                                  5  And fashioned for desire,  Beauty, passion, and joy,  And sorrow and unrest;    And with all things of earth  Eternally must go,                                                       10  Daring the perilous bourn  Of joyance and of death,    A strain of song by night,  A shadow on the hill,  A hint of odorous grass,                                                 15  A murmur of the sea.          LVII      Others shall behold the sun  Through the long uncounted years,--  Not a maid in after time    Wise as thou!    For the gods have given thee  Their best gift, an equal mind                                            5  That can only love, be glad,    And fear not.          LVIII      Let thy strong spirit never fear,  Nor in thy virgin soul be thou afraid.  The gods themselves and the almightier fates  Cannot avail to harm    With outward and misfortunate chance                                      5  The radiant unshaken mind of him  Who at his being's centre will abide,  Secure from doubt and fear.    His wise and patient heart shall share  The strong sweet loveliness of all things made,                          10  And the serenity of inward joy  Beyond the storm of tears.          LIX      Will none say of Sappho,  Speaking of her lovers,  And the love they gave her,--  Joy and days and beauty,  Flute-playing and roses,                                                  5  Song and wine and laughter,--    Will none, musing, murmur,  \"Yet, for all the roses,  All the flutes and lovers,  Doubt not she was lonely                                                 10  As the sea, whose cadence  Haunts the world for ever.\"          LX      When I have departed,  Say but this behind me,  \"Love was all her wisdom,    All her care.    \"Well she kept love's secret,--                                           5  Dared and never faltered,--  Laughed and never doubted    Love would win.    \"Let the world's rough triumph  Trample by above her,                                                    10  She is safe forever    From all harm.    \"In a land that knows not  Bitterness nor sorrow,  She has found out all                                                    15    Of truth at last.\"          LXI      There is no more to say now thou art still,  There is no more to do now thou art dead,  There is no more to know now thy clear mind  Is back returned unto the gods who gave it.    Now thou art gone the use of life is past,                                5  The meaning and the glory and the pride,  There is no joyous friend to share the day,  And on the threshold no awaited shadow.          LXII      Play up, play up thy silver flute;  The crickets all are brave;  Glad is the red autumnal earth    And the blue sea.    Play up thy flawless silver flute;                                        5  Dead ripe are fruit and grain.  When love puts on his scarlet coat,    Put off thy care.          LXIII      A beautiful child is mine,  Formed like a golden flower,  Cleis the loved one.  And above her I value  Not all the Lydian land,                                                  5  Nor lovely Hellas.          LXIV      Ah, but now henceforth  Only one meaning  Has life for me.    Only one purport,  Measure and beauty,                                                       5  Has the bright world.    What mean the wood-winds,  Colour and morning,  Bird, stream, and hill?    And the brave city                                                       10  With its enchantment?  Thee, only thee!          LXV      Softly the wind moves through the radiant morning,  And the warm sunlight sinks into the valley,  Filling the green earth with a quiet joyance,    Strength, and fulfilment.    Even so, gentle, strong and wise and happy,                               5  Through the soul and substance of my being,  Comes the breath of thy great love to me-ward,    O thou dear mortal.          LXVI      What the west wind whispers  At the end of summer,  When the barley harvest  Ripens to the sickle,    Who can tell?                                                           5    What means the fine music  Of the dry cicada,  Through the long noon hours  Of the autumn stillness,    Who can say?                                                           10    How the grape ungathered  With its bloom of blueness  Greatens on the trellis  Of the brick-walled garden,    Who can know?                                                          15    Yet I, too, am greatened,  Keep the note of gladness,  Travel by the wind's road,  Through this autumn leisure,--    By thy love.                                                           20          LXVII      Indoors the fire is kindled;  Beechwood is piled on the hearthstone;  Cold are the chattering oak-leaves;  And the ponds frost-bitten.    Softer than rainfall at twilight,                                         5  Bringing the fields benediction  And the hills quiet and greyness,  Are my long thoughts of thee.    How should thy friend fear the seasons?  They only perish of winter                                               10  Whom Love, audacious and tender,  Never hath visited.          LXVIII      You ask how love can keep the mortal soul  Strong to the pitch of joy throughout the years.    Ask how your brave cicada on the bough  Keeps the long sweet insistence of his cry;    Ask how the Pleiads steer across the night                                5  In their serene unswerving mighty course;    Ask how the wood-flowers waken to the sun,  Unsummoned save by some mysterious word;    Ask how the wandering swallows find your eaves  Upon the rain-wind with returning spring;                                10    Ask who commands the ever-punctual tide  To keep the pendulous rhythm of the sea;    And you shall know what leads the heart of man  To the far haven of his hopes and fears.
