Shortly after the sun has set, these  habiliments are all thrown off, dresses of gossamer are substituted in  their place, and the fair wearers rush out into the open air, to enjoy  the cool night breezes.    This is but the \"Companion to the Map.\" The Voyage to the several Islands  of the Great World, \"is in a frame-work of the adventures of Sir Heedless  Headlong, who neither reaches the Great World by a balloon, nor Perkins's  steam-gun. He cruises about St. James's Straits, makes for Idler's  Harbour, in Alba; is repulsed, but with a friend, Jack Rashleigh,  journeys to Society Island, lands at Small Talk Bay, and makes for the  capital, Flirtington. He first visits a general assembly of the leaders  of the isle. At the house of assembly the rush of charioteers was so  great, that it is impossible to say what might have been the consequence  of the general confusion, or how many lives might have been lost, but for  the interference of a little man in a flaxen wig, and broad-brimmed hat,  with a cane in his hand, whose authority is said to extend equally over  ladies and pickpockets of all degrees.\"[18] Then comes an exquisite bit  of badinage on that most stupid of all stupidities, a fashionable rout.       [18] Quasi Townsend.    \"On entering the walls, my surprise may be partly conceived, at finding  those persons, whom I had seen so eagerly striving to gain admittance,  crowded together in a capacious vapour bath, heated to so high a  temperature, that had I not been aware of the strict prohibition of  science, I should have imagined the meeting to have been held for the  purpose of ascertaining, by experiment, the greatest degree of heat which  the human frame is capable of supporting. That they should choose such a  place for their deliberations upon the welfare of the island, appeared to  me extraordinary, and only to be accounted for upon the supposition that  it was intended to carry off, by evaporation, that internal heat to which  the assemblies of legislators of some other countries are known to be  subject. Judging from the grave and melancholy countenances of the  persons assembled, I councluded the affairs of the island to be in a very  disasterous state; and I could discover very little either said or done,  at all calculated to advance its interests. Of the capital itself, some  members said a few words; but, to use the language of our Globe, in so  inaudible a tone of voice, that we could scarcely catch their import. The  principal subject of their discussion consisted of complaining of the  extreme heat of the bath, and mutual inquiries respecting their intention  of immersing themselves in any others that were open the same night.\"    He next satirizes a fashionable dinner, the parks, the Horticultural  Society, some pleasant jokes upon a rosy mother and her parsnip-pale  daughters, and an admirable piece of fun upon the female oligarchy of  Almacks.    \"From hence I made a trip to Crocky's Island, situated on the opposite  side of the Strait. On landing at Hellgate, within Fools' Inlet my  surprise was much excited by the prodigious flocks of gulls, pigeons, and  geese, which were directing their flight towards the Great Fish Lake,  whither I, too, was making my way. I concluded their object was to  procure food, of which a profusion was here spread before them,  consisting of every thing which such birds most delight to peck at; but  no sooner had they settled near the bank, than they were seized upon by a  Fisherman, (who was lying in wait for them,) and completely plucked of  their feathers, an operation to which they very quietly submitted, and  were then suffered to depart. Upon inquiring his motive for what appeared  to me a wanton act of cruelty, he told me his intention was to stuff his  bed with the feathers; 'or,' added he, 'if you _vill_, to feather my  nest.' Being myself an admirer of a soft bed, I saw no reason why I  should not employ myself in the same way; but owing, perhaps, to my being  a novice in the art, and not knowing how to manage the birds properly,  they were but little disposed to submit themselves to my hands; and, in  the attempt, I found myself so completely covered with feathers, that  which of the three descriptions of birds aforesaid I most resembled, it  would have been difficult to determine. The fisherman, seeing my  situation, was proceeding to add to the stock of feathers which he had  collected in a great bag, by plucking those from my person, when, wishing  to save him any further trouble, I hurried back to Hellgate.\"    We cannot accompany Sir Heedless any further; but must conclude with a  few piquancies from the _Vocabulary of the Language of the Great World_,  which is as necessary to the enjoyment of fashionable life, as is a  glossary to an elementary scientific treatise:--    _At Home._--Making your house as unlike home as possible, by turning  every thing topsy-turvy, removing your furniture, and squeezing as many  people into your rooms as can be compressed together.    _Not at Home._--Sitting in your own room, engaged in reading a new novel,  writing notes, or other important business.    _Affection._--A painful sensation, such as gout, rheumatism, cramp,  head-ache, &c.    _Mourning._--An outward covering of black, put on by the relatives of any  deceased person of consequence, or by persons succeeding to a large  fortune, as an emblem of their grief upon so melancholy an event.    _Morning._--The time corresponding to that between our noon and sun-set.    _Evening._--The time between our sun-set and sun-rise.    _Night._---The time between our sun-rise and noon.    _Domestic._--An epithet applied to cats, dogs, and other tame animals,  keeping at home.    _Reflection._--The person viewed in a looking-glass.    _Tenderness._--A property belonging to meat long kept.    _An Undress._--A thick covering of garments.    _A Treasure._--A lady's maid, skilful in the mysteries of building up  heads, and pulling down characters; ingenious in the construction of  caps, capes, and scandal, and judicious in the application of paint and  flattery; also, a footman, who knows, at a single glance, what visiters  to admit to the presence of his mistress, and whom to refuse.    _Immortality_.--An imaginary privilege of living for ever, conferred upon  heroes, poets, and patriots.    _Taste_.--The art of discerning the precise shades of difference  constituting a bad or well dressed man, woman, or dinner.    _Tact_.--The art of wheedling a rich old relation, winning an heiress, or  dismissing duns with the payment of fair promises.    _Album_.--A ledger kept by ladies for the entry of compliments, in rhyme,  paid _on demand_ to their beautiful hair, complexions fair, the dimpled  chin, the smiles that win, the ruby lips, where the bee sips, &c. &c.;  the whole amount being transferred to their private account from the  public stock.    _Resignation_.--Giving up a place.    _A Heathen_.--An infidel to the tenets of ton, a Goth; a monster; a  vulgar wretch.

This astral part of our own world is  also a globe, but of astral matter. It occupies the same place as the globe  which we see, but its matter (being so much lighter) extends out into space  on all sides of us further than does the atmosphere of the earth--a great  deal further. It stretches to a little less than the mean distance of the  moon, so that though the two physical globes, the earth and the moon, are  nearly 240,000 miles apart, the astral globes of these two bodies touch one  another when the moon is in perigee, but not when she is in apogee. I shall  apply the term \"mental world\" to the still larger globe of mental matter in  the midst of which our physical earth exists. When we come to the still  higher globes we have spheres large enough to touch the corresponding  spheres of other planets in the system, though their matter also is just as  much about us here on the surface of the solid earth as that of the others.  All these globes of finer matter are a part of us, and are all revolving  round the sun with their visible part. The student will do well to accustom  himself to think of our earth as the whole of this mass of interpenetrating  worlds--not only the comparatively small physical ball in the centre of it.          Chapter IV    THE EVOLUTION OF LIFE      All the impulses of life which I have described as building the  interpenetrating worlds come forth from the Third Aspect of the Deity.  Hence in the Christian scheme that Aspect is called \"the Giver of Life\",  the Spirit who brooded over the face of the waters of space. In  Theosophical literature these impulses are usually taken as a whole, and  called the First Outpouring.    When the worlds had been prepared to this extent, and most of the chemical  elements already existed, the Second Outpouring of life took place, and  this came from the Second Aspect of the Deity. It brought with it the power  of combination. In all the worlds it found existing what may be thought of  as elements corresponding to those worlds. It proceeded to combine those  elements into organisms which it then ensouled, and in this way it built up  the seven kingdoms of Nature. Theosophy recognizes seven kingdoms, because  it regards man as separate from the animal kingdom and it takes into  account several stages of evolution which are unseen by the physical eye,  and gives to them the mediaeval name of \"elemental kingdoms\".    The divine Life pours itself into matter from above, and its whole course  may be thought of in two stages--the gradual assumption of grosser and  grosser matter, and then the gradual casting off again of the vehicles  which have been assumed. The earliest level upon which its vehicles can be  scientifically observed is the mental--the fifth counting from the finer to  the grosser, the first on which there are separated globes. In practical  study it is found convenient to divide this mental world into two parts,  which we call the higher and the lower according to the degree of density  of their matter. The higher consists of the three finer subdivisions of  mental matter; the lower part of the other four.    When the outpouring reaches the higher mental world it draws together the  ethereal elements there, combines them into what at that level correspond  to substances and of these substances builds forms which it inhabits. We  call this the first elemental kingdom.    After a long period of evolution through different forms at that level, the  wave of life, which is all the time pressing steadily downwards, learns to  identify itself so fully with those forms that, instead of occupying them  and withdrawing from them periodically, it is able to hold them permanently  and make them part of itself, so that now from that level it can proceed to  the temporary occupation of forms at a still lower level. When it reaches  this stage we call it the second elemental kingdom, the ensouling life of  which resides upon the higher mental levels, while the vehicles through  which it manifests are on the lower.    After another vast period of similar length, it is found that the downward  pressure has caused this process to repeat itself; once more the life has  identified itself with its forms, and has taken up its residence upon the  lower mental levels, so that it is capable of ensouling bodies in the  astral world. At this stage we call it the third elemental kingdom.    We speak of all these forms as finer or grosser relatively to one another,  but all of them are almost infinitely finer than any with which we are  acquainted in the physical world. Each of these three is a kingdom of  Nature, as varied in the manifestations of its different forms of life as  is the animal or vegetable kingdom which we know. After a long period spent  in ensouling the forms of the third of these elemental kingdoms it  identifies itself with them in turn, and so is able to ensoul the etheric  part of the mineral kingdom, and becomes the life which vivifies that--for  there is a life in the mineral kingdom just as much as in the vegetable or  the animal, although it is in conditions where it cannot manifest so  freely. In the course of the mineral evolution the downward pressure causes  it to identify itself in the same way with the etheric matter of the  physical world, and from that to ensoul the denser matter of such minerals  as are perceptible to our senses.    In the mineral kingdom we include not only what are usually called  minerals, but also liquids, gases and many etheric substances the existence  of which is unknown to western science. All the matter of which we know  anything is living matter, and the life which it contains is always  evolving. When it has reached the central point of the mineral stage the  downward pressure ceases, and is replaced by an upward tendency; the  outbreathing has ceased and the indrawing has begun.    When mineral evolution is completed, the life has withdrawn itself again  into the astral world, but bearing with it all the results obtained through  its experiences in the physical. At this stage it ensouls vegetable forms,  and begins to show itself much more clearly as what we commonly call  life--plant-life of all kinds; and at a yet later stage of its development  it leaves the vegetable kingdom and ensouls the animal kingdom. The  attainment of this level is the sign that it has withdrawn itself still  further, and is now working from the lower mental world. In order to work  in physical matter from that mental world it must operate through the  intervening astral matter; and that astral matter is now no longer part of  the garment of the group-soul as a whole, but is the individual astral body  of the animal concerned, as will be later explained.    In each of these kingdoms it not only passes a period of time which is to  our ideas almost incredibly long, but it also goes through a definite  course of evolution, beginning from the lower manifestations of that  kingdom and ending with the highest. In the vegetable kingdom, for example,  the life-force might commence its career by occupying grasses or mosses and  end it by ensouling magnificent forest trees. In the animal kingdom it  might commence with mosquitoes or with animalculae, and might end with the  finest specimens of the mammalia.    The whole process is one of steady evolution from lower forms to higher,  from the simpler to the more complex. But what is evolving is not primarily  the form, but the life within it. The forms also evolve and grow better as  time passes; but this is in order that they may be appropriate vehicles for  more and more advanced waves of life. When the life has reached the highest  level possible in the animal kingdom, it may then pass on into the human  kingdom, under conditions which will presently be explained.    The outpouring leaves one kingdom and passes to another, so that if we had  to deal with only one wave of this outpouring we could have in existence  only one kingdom at a time. But the Deity sends out a constant succession  of these waves, so that at any given time we find a number of them  simultaneously in operation. We ourselves represent one such wave; but we  find evolving alongside us another wave which ensouls the animal kingdom--a  wave which came out from the Deity one stage later than we did. We find  also the vegetable kingdom, which represents a third wave, and the mineral  kingdom, which represents a fourth; and occultists know of the existence  all round us of three elemental kingdoms, which represent the fifth, sixth  and seventh waves. All these, however, are successive ripples of the same  great outpouring from the Second Aspect of the Deity.    We have here, then, a scheme of evolution in which the divine Life involves  itself more and more deeply in matter, in order that through that matter it  may receive vibrations which could not otherwise affect it--impacts from  without, which by degrees arouse within it rates of undulation  corresponding to their own, so that it learns to respond to them. Later on  it learns of itself to generate these rates of undulation, and so becomes a  being possessed of spiritual powers.    We may presume that when this outpouring of life originally came forth from  the Deity, at some level altogether beyond our power of cognition, it may  perhaps have been homogeneous; but when it first comes within practical  cognizance, when it is itself in the intuitional world, but is ensouling  bodies made of the matter of the higher mental world, it is already not one  huge world-soul but many souls. Let us suppose a homogeneous outpouring,"]]]
