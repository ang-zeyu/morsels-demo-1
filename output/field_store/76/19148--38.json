For he had lied, beyond all doubt. His statement as to  the almost continuous stupor was absolutely irreconcilable with his  other statement as to the patient's wilfulness and obstinacy and even  more irreconcilable with the deep and comparatively fresh marks of the  spectacles on the patient's nose. That man had certainly worn spectacles  within twenty-four hours, which he would hardly have done if he had been  in a state bordering on coma.    My reflections were interrupted by the stopping of the carriage. The  door was unlocked and thrown open, and I emerged from my dark and stuffy  prison opposite my own house.    \"I will let you have the medicine in a minute or two,\" I said to the  coachman; and, as I let myself in with my latch-key, my mind came back  swiftly from the general circumstances of the case to the very critical  condition of the patient. Already I was regretting that I had not taken  more energetic measures to rouse him and restore his flagging vitality;  for it would be a terrible thing if he should take a turn for the worse  and die before the coachman returned with the remedies. Spurred on by  this alarming thought, I made up the medicines quickly and carried the  hastily wrapped bottles out to the man, whom I found standing by the  horse's head.    \"Get back as quickly as you can,\" I said, \"and tell Mr. Weiss to lose no  time in giving the patient the draught in the small bottle. The  directions are on the labels.\"    The coachman took the packages from me without reply, climbed to his  seat, touched the horse with his whip and drove off at a rapid pace  towards Newington Butts.    The little clock in the consulting-room showed that it was close on  eleven; time for a tired G.P. to be thinking of bed. But I was not  sleepy. Over my frugal supper I found myself taking up anew the thread  of my meditations, and afterwards, as I smoked my last pipe by the  expiring surgery fire, the strange and sinister features of the case  continued to obtrude themselves on my notice. I looked up Stillbury's  little reference library for information on the subject of sleeping  sickness, but learned no more than that it was \"a rare and obscure  disease of which very little was known at present.\" I read up morphine  poisoning and was only further confirmed in the belief that my diagnosis  was correct; which would have been more satisfactory if the  circumstances had been different.    For the interest of the case was not merely academic. I was in a  position of great difficulty and responsibility and had to decide on a  course of action. What ought I to do? Should I maintain the professional  secrecy to which I was tacitly committed, or ought I to convey a hint to  the police?    Suddenly, and with a singular feeling of relief, I bethought myself of  my old friend and fellow-student, John Thorndyke, now an eminent  authority on Medical Jurisprudence. I had been associated with him  temporarily in one case as his assistant, and had then been deeply  impressed by his versatile learning, his acuteness and his marvellous  resourcefulness. Thorndyke was a barrister in extensive practice, and so  would be able to tell me at once what was my duty from a legal point of  view; and, as he was also a doctor of medicine, he would understand the  exigencies of medical practice. If I could find time to call at the  Temple and lay the case before him, all my doubts and difficulties would  be resolved.    Anxiously, I opened my visiting-list to see what kind of day's work was  in store for me on the morrow. It was not a heavy day, even allowing for  one or two extra calls in the morning, but yet I was doubtful whether it  would allow of my going so far from my district, until my eye caught,  near the foot of the page, the name of Burton. Now Mr. Burton lived in  one of the old houses on the east side of Bouverie Street, less than  five minutes' walk from Thorndyke's chambers in King's Bench Walk; and  he was, moreover, a \"chronic\" who could safely be left for the last.  When I had done with Mr. Burton I could look in on my friend with a very  good chance of catching him on his return from the hospital. I could  allow myself time for quite a long chat with him, and, by taking a  hansom, still get back in good time for the evening's work.    This was a great comfort. At the prospect of sharing my responsibilities  with a friend on whose judgment I could so entirely rely, my  embarrassments seemed to drop from me in a moment. Having entered the  engagement in my visiting-list, I rose, in greatly improved spirits, and  knocked out my pipe just as the little clock banged out impatiently the  hour of midnight.          Chapter II    Thorndyke Devises a Scheme      As I entered the Temple by the Tudor Street gate the aspect of the place  smote my senses with an air of agreeable familiarity. Here had I spent  many a delightful hour when working with Thorndyke at the remarkable  Hornby case, which the newspapers had called \"The Case of the Red Thumb  Mark\"; and here had I met the romance of my life, the story whereof is  told elsewhere. The place was thus endeared to me by pleasant  recollections of a happy past, and its associations suggested hopes of  happiness yet to come and in the not too far distant future.    My brisk tattoo on the little brass knocker brought to the door no less  a person than Thorndyke himself; and the warmth of his greeting made me  at once proud and ashamed. For I had not only been an absentee; I had  been a very poor correspondent.    \"The prodigal has returned, Polton,\" he exclaimed, looking into the  room. \"Here is Dr. Jervis.\"    I followed him into the room and found Polton--his confidential servant,  laboratory assistant, artificer and general \"familiar\"--setting out the  tea-tray on a small table. The little man shook hands cordially with me,  and his face crinkled up into the sort of smile that one might expect to  see on a benevolent walnut.    \"We've often talked about you, sir,\" said he. \"The doctor was wondering  only yesterday when you were coming back to us.\"    As I was not \"coming back to them\" quite in the sense intended I felt a  little guilty, but reserved my confidences for Thorndyke's ear and  replied in polite generalities. Then Polton fetched the tea-pot from the  laboratory, made up the fire and departed, and Thorndyke and I subsided,  as of old, into our respective arm-chairs.    \"And whence do you spring from in this unexpected fashion?\" my colleague  asked. \"You look as if you had been making professional visits.\"    \"I have. The base of operations is in Lower Kennington Lane.\"    \"Ah! Then you are 'back once more on the old trail'?\"    \"Yes,\" I answered, with a laugh, \"'the old trail, the long trail, the  trail that is always new.'\"    \"And leads nowhere,\" Thorndyke added grimly.    I laughed again; not very heartily, for there was an uncomfortable  element of truth in my friend's remark, to which my own experience bore  only too complete testimony. The medical practitioner whose lack of  means forces him to subsist by taking temporary charge of other men's  practices is apt to find that the passing years bring him little but  grey hairs and a wealth of disagreeable experience.    \"You will have to drop it, Jervis; you will, indeed,\" Thorndyke resumed  after a pause. \"This casual employment is preposterous for a man of your  class and professional attainments. Besides, are you not engaged to be  married and to a most charming girl?\"    \"Yes, I know. I have been a fool. But I will really amend my ways. If  necessary, I will pocket my pride and let Juliet advance the money to  buy a practice.\"    \"That,\" said Thorndyke, \"is a very proper resolution. Pride and reserve  between people who are going to be husband and wife, is an absurdity.  But why buy a practice? Have you forgotten my proposal?\"    \"I should be an ungrateful brute if I had.\"    \"Very well. I repeat it now. Come to me as my junior, read for the Bar  and work with me, and, with your abilities, you will have a chance of  something like a career. I want you, Jervis,\" he added, earnestly. \"I  must have a junior, with my increasing practice, and you are the junior  I want. We are old and tried friends; we have worked together; we like  and trust one another, and you are the best man for the job that I know.  Come; I am not going to take a refusal. This is an ultimatum.\"    \"And what is the alternative?\" I asked with a smile at his eagerness.    \"There isn't any. You are going to say yes.\"    \"I believe I am,\" I answered, not without emotion; \"and I am more  rejoiced at your offer and more grateful than I can tell you. But we  must leave the final arrangements for our next meeting--in a week or so,  I hope--for I have to be back in an hour, and I want to consult you on  a matter of some importance.\"    \"Very well,\" said Thorndyke; \"we will leave the formal agreement for  consideration at our next meeting. What is it that you want my opinion  on?\"    \"The fact is,\" I said, \"I am in a rather awkward dilemma, and I want you  to tell me what you think I ought to do.\"    Thorndyke paused in the act of refilling my cup and glanced at me with  unmistakable anxiety.    \"Nothing of an unpleasant nature, I hope,\" said he.    \"No, no; nothing of that kind,\" I answered with a smile as I interpreted  the euphemism; for \"something unpleasant,\" in the case of a young and  reasonably presentable medical man is ordinarily the equivalent of  trouble with the female of his species. \"It is nothing that concerns me  personally at all,\" I continued; \"it is a question of professional"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12192"],[0,"The Long Shadow (#5)"],[1,"as far as possible under the bunk.  Boxes and benches he piled on top; then he brought buckets of water  and sloshed it upon the worst places, sweeping and spreading it with  a broom. When the water grew quite black, he opened the door, swept  it outside and sloshed fresh water upon the grimy boards. While  he worked, his mind swung slowly back to normal, so that he sang  crooningly in an undertone; and the song was what he had sung for  months and years, until it was a part of him and had earned him his  nickname.         \"Oh, where have you been, Billy boy, Billy boy?       Oh, where have you been, charming Billy?         I've been to see my wife,         She's the joy of my life,       She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother.\"    Certainly it was neither musical nor inspiring, but Billy had somehow  adopted the ditty and made it his own, so far as eternally singing  it could do so, and his comrades had found it not unpleasant; for  the voice of Billy was youthful, and had a melodious smoothness that  atoned for much in the way of imbecile words and monotonous tune.    He had washed all the dishes and had repeated the ditty fifteen times,  and was for the sixteenth time tunefully inquiring:         Can she make a punkin pie, charming Billy?    when he opened the door to throw out the dishwater, and narrowly escaped  landing it full upon the fur-coated form of his foreman.          CHAPTER IV.    _Canned._      The foreman came in, blinking at the sudden change from bright light  to half twilight, and Charming Billy took the opportunity to kick a  sardine can of stove-blacking under the stove where it would not be  seen. Some predecessor with domestic instincts had left behind  him half a package of \"Rising Sun,\" and Billy had found it and was  intending to blacken the stove just as soon as he finished the dishes.  That he had left it as a crowning embellishment, rather than making it  the foundation of his house-cleaning, only proved his inexperience in  that line. Billy had \"bached\" a great deal, but he had never blacked a  stove in his life.    The foreman passed gloved fingers over his eyes, held them there  a moment, took them away and gazed in amazement; since he had been  foreman of the Double-Crank--and the years were many--Charming  Billy Boyle had been one of its \"top-hands,\" and he had never before  caught him in the throes of \"digging out.\"    \"Fundamental furies!\" swore he, in the unorthodox way he had. \"Looks  like the Pilgrim was right--there's a lady took charge here.\"    Charming Billy turned red with embarrassment, and then quite pale with  rage. \"The Pilgrim lied!\" he denied sweepingly.    The foreman picked his way over the wet floor, in deference to its  comparative cleanliness stepping long so that he might leave as few  disfiguring tracks as possible, and unbuttoned his fur coat before the  heat of the stove.    \"Well, maybe he did,\" he assented generously, gleaning a box from  the pile on the bunk and sitting down, \"but it sure looks like  corroborative evidence, in here. How about it, Bill?\"    \"How about what?\" countered Billy, his teeth close together.    \"The girl, and the dawg, and the fight--but more especially the girl.  The Pilgrim--\"    \"_Damn_ the Pilgrim! I wisht I'd a-killed the lying ---- The girl's  a lady, and he ain't fit to speak her name. She come here last night  because her hoss fell and got crippled, and there wasn't a hoss I'd  trust at night with her, it was storming so hard, and slippery--and  at daylight I put her on the gentlest one we had, and took her home.  That's all there is to it. There's nothing to gabble about, and if the  Pilgrim goes around shooting off his face--\" Billy clicked his teeth  ominously.    \"Well, that ain't _just_ the way he told it,\" commented the foreman,  stooping to expectorate into the hearth and stopping to regard  surprisedly its unwonted emptiness. \"He said--\"    \"I don't give a damn what he said,\" snapped Billy. \"He lied, the  low-down cur.\"    \"Uh-huh--he said something about you shooting that dawg of his. I saw  the carcass out there in the snow.\" The foreman spoke with careful  neutrality.    \"I did. I wisht now I'd laid the two of 'em out together. The dawg  tried to feed offa my leg. I shot the blame thing.\" Charming Billy  sat down upon the edge of the table--sliding the dishpan out of his  way--and folded his arms, and pushed his hat farther back from his  forehead. His whole attitude spoke impenitent scorn.    \"I also licked the Pilgrim and hazed him away from camp and told him  particular not to come back,\" he informed the other defiantly. He did  not add, \"What are you going to do about it?\" but his tone carried  unmistakably that sentiment.    \"And the Pilgrim happens to be a stepbrother uh the widow the Old Man  is at present running after, and aiming to marry. I was sent over here  to put the can onto you, Billy. I hate like thunder to do it, but--\"  The foreman waved a hand to signify his utter helplessness.    The face of Billy stiffened perceptibly; otherwise he moved not a  muscle.    \"The Old Man says for you to stay till he can put another man down  here in your place, though. He'll send Jim Bleeker soon as he comes  back from town--which ain't apt to be for two or three days unless  they're short on booze.\"    Billy caught his breath, hesitated, and reached for his smoking  material. It was not till he had licked his cigarette into shape and  was feeling in his pocket for a match that he spoke. \"I've drawed  wages from the Double-Crank for quite a spell, and I always aimed  to act white with the outfit. It's more than they're doing by me,  but--I'll stay till Jim comes.\" He smoked moodily, and stared at his  boots. \"Yuh ain't going back tonight, are yuh?\"    The foreman said he must, and came back to the subject. \"Yuh don't  want to think I'm firing yuh, Billy. If it was my say-so, I'd tell the  Pilgrim to go to hell. But he went straight to headquarters with his  tale uh woe, and the Old Man is kinda uncertain these days, on account  uh not being right sure uh the widow. He feels just about obliged to  keep the Pilgrim smoothed down; he ain't worth his grub, if you ask  me.\"    \"Oh, I ain't thinking nothing at all about it,\" Billy lied proudly.  \"If the Old Man feels like canning me, that there's his funeral. I  reckon maybe he likes the Pilgrim's breed better for a change. And  I wouldn't be none surprised if I could get a job with some other  outfit, all right. I ain't aiming to starve--nor yet ride grub-line.\"    \"When you analyze the thing right down to fundamentals,\" observed the  foreman, whom men called \"Jawbreaker\" for obvious reasons, \"it's a  cussed shame. You're one of the oldest men with the outfit, and the  Pilgrim is the youngest--and the most inadequate. The Old Man oughta  waited till he heard both sides uh the case, and I told him so. But  he couldn't forget how the widow might feel if he canned her  stepbrother--and what's a man, more or less, in a case uh that kind?\"    \"Now look here, Jawbreaker,\" Billy protested cheerfully, \"don't yuh go  oozing comfort and sympathy on my account. I don't know but what I'm  tickled to death. As yuh say, I've worked for this outfit a blame long  while--and it's maybe kinda hard on other outfits; they oughta have a  chance to use me for a spell. There's no reason why the Double-Crank  should be a hog and keep a good man forever.\"    The foreman studied keenly the face of Charming Billy, saw there an  immobility that somehow belied his cheerful view of the case, and  abruptly changed the subject.    \"You've got things swept and garnished, all right,\" he remarked,  looking at the nearly clean floor with the tiny pools of dirty water  still standing in the worn places. \"When did the fit take yuh? Did it  come on with fever-n'-chills, like most other breaking-outs? Or, did  the girl--\"    \"Aw, the darned dawg mussed up the floor, dying in here,\" Billy  apologized weakly. \"I was plumb obliged to clean up after him.\" He  glanced somewhat shamefacedly at the floor. After all, it did not  look quite like the one where Miss Bridger lived; in his heart Billy  believed that was because he had no strip of carpet to spread before  the table. He permitted his glance to take in the bunk, nakedly  showing the hay it held for a softening influence and piled high with  many things--the things that would not go beneath.    \"Your soogans are gathering frost to beat the band, Bill,\" the foreman  informed him, following his glance to the bunk. \"Your inexperience  is something appalling, for a man that has fried his own bacon and  swabbed out his own frying-pan as many times as you have. Better go  bring 'em in. It was thinking about snowing again when I come.\"    Billy grinned a little and went after his bedding, brought it and  threw it with a fine disregard for order upon the accumulation of  boxes and benches in the bunk. \"I'll go feed the hosses, and then I'll  cook yuh some supper,\" he told the foreman still humped comfortably  before the stove with his fur coat thrown open to the heat and his  spurred boots hoisted upon the hearth. \"Better make up your mind to  stay till morning; it's getting mighty chilly, outside.\"    The foreman, at the critical stage of cigarette lighting, grunted  unintelligibly. Billy was just laying hand to the door-knob when the  foreman looked toward him in the manner of one about to speak. Billy  stood and waited inquiringly.    \"Say, Bill,\" drawled Jawbreaker, \"yuh never told me her name, yet.\"    The brows of Charming Billy pinched involuntarily together. \"I thought  the Pilgrim had wised yuh up to all the details,\" he said coldly.    \"The Pilgrim didn't know; he says yuh never introduced him. And seeing  it's serious enough to start yuh on the godly trail uh cleanliness,  I'm naturally taking a friendly interest in her, and--\"    \"Aw--go to hell!\" snapped Charming Billy, and went out and slammed the  door behind him so that the"]]]
