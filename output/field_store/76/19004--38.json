I then went to look at the springes, but found only one  single little bird, whereby I saw that the wrath of God had not yet passed  away. Howbeit, I found a fine blackberry bush, from which I gathered  nearly a pint of berries, and put them, together with the bird, in Staffer  Zuter his pot, which the honest fellow had left with us for a while, and  set them on the fire for supper against my child and the maid should  return. It was not long before they came through the coppice and told me  of the fearful devastation which Satan had made in the village and manse  by the permission of all-righteous God. My child had gathered together a  few books, which she brought with her, above all, a _Virgilius_ and a  Greek Bible. And after she had told me that the carpenter would not have  done till next day, and we had satisfied the cravings of hunger, I made  her read to me again, for the greater strengthening of my faith, the  _locus_ about the blessed raven from the Greek of Luke, at the twelfth  chapter; also, the beautiful _locus parallelus_, Matt. vi. After which the  maid said the evening blessing, and we all went into the cave to rest for  the night. When I awoke next morning, just as the blessed sun rose out the  sea and peeped over the mountain, I heard my poor hungry child already  standing outside the cave reciting the beautiful verses about the joys of  paradise which St. Augustine wrote and I had taught her. She sobbed for  grief as she spoke the words:--      Uno pane vivunt cives utriusque patriae;    Avidi et semper pleni, quod habent desiderant.    Non sacietas fastidit, neque fames cruciat;    Inhiantes semper edunt, et edentes inhiant.    Flos perpetuus rosarum ver agit perpetuum;    Candent lilia, rubescit crocus, sudat balsamum,    Virent prata, vernant sata, rivi mellis influunt;    Pigmentorum spirat odor liquor et aromatum,    Pendent poma floridorum non lapsura nemorum.    Non alternat luna vices, sol vel cursus syderum.    Agnus est faelicis urbis lumen inocciduum.    At these words my own heart was melted; and when she ceased from speaking,  I asked, \"What art thou doing, my child?\" Whereupon she answered, \"Father,  I am eating.\" Thereat my tears now indeed began to flow, and I praised her  for feeding her soul, as she had no meat for her body. I had not, however,  spoken long, before she cried to me to come and look at the great wonder  that had risen out of the sea, and already appeared over the cave. For  behold a cloud, in shape just like a cross, came over us, and let great  heavy drops, as big or bigger than large peas, fall on our heads, after  which it sank behind the coppice. I presently arose and ran up the  mountain with my daughter to look after it. It floated on towards the  Achterwater, where it spread itself out into a long blue streak, whereon  the sun shone so brightly that it seemed like a golden bridge on which, as  my child said, the blessed angels danced. I fell on my knees with her and  thanked the Lord that our cross had passed away from us; but, alas! our  cross was yet to come, as will be told hereafter.          _The Eighth Chapter_      HOW OUR NEED WAXED SORER AND SORER, AND HOW I SENT OLD ILSE WITH ANOTHER  LETTER TO PUDGLA, AND HOW HEAVY A MISFORTUNE THIS BROUGHT UPON ME    Next day, when I had buried the poor corpses amid the lamentations of the  whole village (by the same token that they were all buried under where the  lime-tree overhangs the wall), I heard with many sighs that neither the  sea nor the Achterwater would yield anything. It was now ten days since  the poor people had caught a single fish. I therefore went out into the  field, musing how the wrath of the just God might be turned from us,  seeing that the cruel winter was now at hand, and neither corn, apples,  fish nor flesh to be found in the village, nor even throughout all the  parish. There was indeed plenty of game in the forests of Coserow and  Uekeritze; but the old forest ranger, Zabel Nehring, had died last year of  the plague, and there was no new one in his place. Nor was there a musket  nor a grain of powder to be found in all the parish; the enemy had robbed  and broken everything: we were therefore forced, day after day, to see  how the stags and the roes, the hares and the wild boars, _et cet_., ran  past us, when we would so gladly have had them in our bellies, but had no  means of getting at them: for they were too cunning to let themselves be  caught in pit-falls. Nevertheless, Claus Peer succeeded in trapping a roe,  and gave me a piece of it, for which may God reward him. _Item_, of  domestic cattle there was not a head left; neither was there a dog, nor  a cat, which the people had not either eaten in their extreme hunger,  or knocked on the head or drowned long since. Albeit old farmer Paasch  still owned two cows; _item_, an old man in Uekeritze was said to have  one little pig:--this was all. Thus, then, nearly all the people lived on  blackberries and other wild fruits: the which also soon grew to be scarce,  as may easily be guessed. Besides all this, a boy of fourteen was missing  (old Labahn his son) and was never more heard of, so that I shrewdly think  that the wolves devoured him.    And now let any Christian judge by his own heart in what sorrow and  heaviness I took my staff in my hand, seeing that my child fell away like  a shadow from pinching hunger; although I myself, being old, did not, by  the help of God's mercy, find any great failing in my strength. While I  thus went continually weeping before the Lord, on the way to Uekeritze, I  fell in with an old beggar with his wallet, sitting on a stone, and eating  a piece of God's rare gift, to wit, a bit of bread. Then truly did my poor  mouth so fill with water that I was forced to bow my head and let it run  upon the earth before I could ask, \"Who art thou? and whence comest thou?  seeing that thou hast bread.\" Whereupon he answered that he was a poor man  of Bannemin, from whom the enemy had taken all; and as he had heard that  the Lieper Winkel had long been in peace, he had travelled thither to beg.  I straightway answered him, \"Oh, poor beggar-man, spare to me, a sorrowful  servant of Christ, who is poorer even than thyself, one little slice of  bread for his wretched child; for thou must know that I am the pastor of  this village, and that my daughter is dying of hunger. I beseech thee by  the living God not to let me depart without taking pity on me, as pity  also hath been shown to thee!\" But the beggar-man would give me none,  saying that he himself had a wife and four children, who were likewise  staggering towards death's door under the bitter pangs of hunger; that the  famine was sorer far in Bannemin than here, where we still had berries;  whether I had not heard that but a few days ago a woman (he told me her  name, but horror made me forget it) had there killed her own child, and  devoured it from hunger? That he could not therefore help me, and I might  go to the Lieper Winkel myself.    I was horror-stricken at his tale, as is easy to guess, for we in our own  trouble had not yet heard of it, there being little or no traffic between  one village and another; and thinking on Jerusalem, and sheer despairing  because the Lord had visited us, as of old that ungodly city, although we  had not betrayed or crucified him, I almost forgot all my necessities, and  took my staff in my hand to depart. But I had not gone more than a few  yards when the beggar called me to stop, and when I turned myself round he  came towards me with a good hunch of bread which he had taken out of his  wallet, and said, \"There! but pray for me also, so that I may reach my  home; for if on the road they smell that I have bread, my own brother  would strike me dead, I believe.\" This I promised with joy, and instantly  turned back to take to my child the gift hidden in my pocket. And behold,  when I came to the road which leads to Loddin, I could scarce trust my  eyes (before I had overlooked it in my distress) when I saw my glebe,  which could produce seven bushels, ploughed, sown, and in stalk; the  blessed crop of rye had already shot lustily out of the earth a finger's  length in height. I could not choose but think that the Evil One had  deceived me with a false show, yet, however hard I rubbed my eyes, rye it  was and rye it remained. And seeing that old Paasch his piece of land  which joined mine was in like manner sown, and that the blades had shot up  to the same height, I soon guessed that the good fellow had done this  deed, seeing that all the other land lay waste. Wherefore, I readily  forgave him for not knowing the morning prayer; and thanking the Lord for  so much love from my flock, and earnestly beseeching him to grant me  strength and faith to bear with them steadfastly and patiently all the  troubles and adversities which it might please him henceforward to lay  upon us, according to his divine pleasure, I ran rather than walked back  into the village to old Paasch his farm, where I found him just about to  kill his cow, which he was slaughtering from grim hunger. \"God bless  thee,\" said I, \"worthy friend, for sowing my field; how shall I reward  thee?\" But the old man answered, \"Let that be, and do you pray for us\";  and when I gladly promised this and asked him how he had kept his corn  safe from the savage enemy, he told me that he had hidden it secretly in  the caves of the Streckelberg, but that now all his store was used up.  Meanwhile he cut a fine large piece of meat from the top of the loin, and  said, \"There is something for you, and when that is gone you can come  again for more.\" As I was then about to go with many thanks, his little  Mary, a child nearly seven years old, the same who had said the _Gratias_  on the Streckelberg, seized me by the hand and wanted to go to school to  my daughter; for since my _Custos_, as above mentioned, departed this life  in the plague, she had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8745"],[0,"Wulf the Saxon: A Story of the Norman Conquest (#4)"],[1,"seen you today, for I was at hand when you had that quarrel  with the Norman page.\"    \"Yes, I caught sight of your face, Ulred. It was about that I have  come to you. The bishop has made complaint against me to the king,  and Earl Harold has ordered me to go down to Steyning for a time.  Of course I acted wrongly in speaking as I did to the bishop, but  so far as Walter Fitz-Urse is concerned I maintain that I did no  wrong. I told my lord as much, and that the Norman put hand upon  his dagger. The earl said that if I could prove that it would benefit  my case. I told him that I had seen you close by, but that I did  not know whether you saw the page do it.\"    \"Assuredly I did,\" the smith replied, \"and had my cudgel in readiness  to tap him on the wrist if he had drawn his dagger. I would testify  the same before King Edward himself.\"    \"Thank you, Ulred, I will tell my lord so.\"    \"I am sorry you are to be sent away from court. That is a bad job,  Master Wulf, and Osgod here will miss you greatly.\"    \"That shall I,\" the lad said. \"Could you not take me down with you,  young master? You could teach me there how to comport myself as  your squire, so that when the time comes that you need one, I should  know my duties. Besides, you could practise on me with sword and  battle-axe.\"    \"I could not do much in the way of teaching you, Osgod, seeing as  yet I am myself but a learner, but I should be glad, in truth, to  have you with me, and it would be good for me to keep up my practice  in arms. I shall feel almost like a stranger there, and should like  to have one I know with me. I could ask Earl Harold to let me have  a horse for you from his stables, where he has two or three score  doing nothing.\"    \"With your favour, sir, I would rather trust to my own feet. I am  a stout walker, and though I shall not be able to keep up with you,  I think that each night I can get to the hostelrie where you may  put up; but, if not, it matters little, I can make my way after you  and join you there--that is, if my father will give me permission  to go.\"    \"You may as well go sooner as later,\" the smith said. \"Since you  have taken into your head that you will be Master Wulf's man, I see  not that it will benefit you remaining in the forge. You know enough  now to mend a broken rivet and to do such repairs to helm and armour  as may be needed on an expedition; therefore, if the young thane  is minded to take you I have naught to say against it.\"    \"Then so shall it be,\" Wulf said, \"I shall see my Lord Harold before  I start, and will tell him that you are minded to be my man, and  that I am minded so to take you. He will not object, I am sure, but  it were best to ask him, since, when I return to court, I shall  have you about me.\"    \"When do you start, Master Wulf?\"    \"I am ordered to go to-day; therefore, as soon as I have  seen the earl again I shall be off.\"    \"Where will you sleep to-night?\"    \"I shall ride to Guildford this afternoon.\"    \"Then you had better lay aside your hammer at once, Osgod,\"  the smith said, \"and don fresh clothes, and make your best suit  into a bundle and start without delay; it is but ten o'clock,  and you may be at Guildford before sunset. 'Tis but thirty  miles, and eight hours' walking will take you there. If the young  thane tells you that Lord Harold makes objection to his taking  you, you can turn your face backward to-morrow and no harm  will be done.\"    \"I shall overtake you before you are half-way, Osgod, and  can then take you up behind me on my horse; and now I will  go back to the palace. I may have to wait some time before I  can see Earl Harold. From sunrise to sunset he has but a few  moments to himself, and I shall have to watch my time to get  a word with him.\"    It was not, indeed, until two o'clock in the afternoon that  Wulf had a chance of speaking to the duke. Then, seeing that  he was for the moment alone, he entered the room and stood  with bowed head waiting for Harold to address him.    \"So you have come to say good-bye, Wulf,\" the latter said kindly;  \"it is best so, boy. A time in the country will do you good, and  there will be much for you to do down there. I have ordered two of  my men to be in readiness to mount and ride with you, for I would  not that you should go unattended. One of them will bear a message  from me and a letter under my hand to the steward, and will tell  him that although you will, of course, remain as my ward until you  come of age, you are in all respects to be treated as if you were  already my sworn man, and thane. It would be well if you could  gather among your tenants twenty stout men as house-carls. The  steward is ordered to pay to you whatever moneys you may require,  and to account for them to me when he sends me in his checkers.  These house-carls will, of course, be paid. There must be ample  store of armour at Steyning for them, for your father was followed  by forty house-carls when he went with me to the Welsh wars. One  of the men who goes with you is a stout man-at-arms and is one of  my own house-carls; he will remain with you and will instruct your  men in arms and teach them to fight shoulder to shoulder. There may  be bad times ere long, and it is upon trained troops and not upon  hasty levies that we must most depend. In time I trust you will be  able to place fifty such men in the field, but at present twenty  will suffice. Have you aught to say to me before you go?\"    \"Yes, my lord; first, to thank you for your kindness, and to say  that I will carry out your instructions; secondly, to tell you that  Ulred the smith saw Walter Fitz-Urse handle his dagger, and was  standing ready to knock it from his hand did he draw it. Lastly,  that Ulred's son Osgod, who is a stout lad a year older than myself,  and for his age well accustomed to arms, desires to be sworn as my  man and to serve me in hall and in field. I like him much and have  almost daily practised with him in arms, and I should be glad to  have him with me if you see no objection.\"    \"Not at all, Wulf; it is well that a man should have at his side  one in whom he can altogether trust, be he of gentle blood or simple  man-at-arms.\"    \"Then I may take him down with me, my lord?\"    \"Yes, if it pleases you. Can he ride?\"    \"Not as yet, my lord, I will see that he is instructed down at  Steyning. He started to walk this morning, understanding that if  you refused him permission to be my man he would at once return.  We shall overtake him on the road.\"    \"Bid one of your escort take him up behind,\" the earl said, \"I like  his spirit. See that he is fittingly apparelled. You shall hear  from me ere long.\"    Half an hour later Wulf mounted, and with his two followers rode  from Westminster.          CHAPTER II.      COUNTRY LIFE.    Far from being depressed, Wulf felt his spirits rise as he rode  away on his banishment from court, for instead of feeling it a  disgrace he regarded it as a step forward in life. Earl Harold  could certainly, had he been so inclined, have smoothed down the  angry prelate, and could have retained him at court; but by the way  he had spoken, Wulf was convinced that the earl let him go because  he thought that it was good for him to be away. For four years he  had been under tutelage, first at Waltham, and then at the court.  In the last position his life had indeed been a pleasant one, for  as one of Harold's pages he had mixed with all the noble youths of  the court, and had had a place at every festive gathering. Still,  he had been but a page, and treated as a boy. Now he was to go  forth, and to learn his duties as his father's successor.    Harold's steward, who had since the thane's death acted as the  earl's agent in the management of the estate, would instruct him  doubtless in his civil duties, while the soldier who rode behind  him would teach him how to lead men in battle, and how to make the  fighting force of the estate efficient. Beyond these duties his  time would be his own. He would have responsibilities, but they  would be the responsibilities of a thane towards his tenants, and  not of a page towards his master. He was going away a boy, but if  it pleased Harold that he should remain away for two years he would  return a thane. A young one, indeed, but one who had learned the  duties of his station, and who, if needs be, could take his place  in the field of battle at the head of his followers. For, even  putting aside the Normans, from whom the earl seemed to think the  greatest danger would come, there was never any long cessation of  fighting in England.    There were the Welsh, who were always turbulent; the Danes of  Northumbria, who were still a distinct people, although throughout  the rest of England their identity was fast being merged into that  of the Saxons. There were the Norsemen, still ready to take every  opportunity of interfering in the affairs of England, or, if none  offered, to plunder and harry the coast. There were the earls of  Mercia, who bore no great love to the house of Godwin, and who  resented the ascendency of the West Saxons. Lastly, there was  Harold's brother Tostig, a fiery and turbulent noble, now Earl of  Northumbria, who was jealous of Harold, ever ready to join in plots,  and in close alliance with Norway already; he had several times  withstood the royal authority, and would assuredly again become a  fomenter of trouble should he see a favourable opportunity. At the  king's death, if not before, that opportunity would be sure to  present itself. Harold would be certainly chosen king by the people  of London and by the West Saxons, but almost as certainly would his  claim be disputed by the earls of Mercia on one hand, and by Tostig  and the Danes on the other. Wulf was sure, therefore, that the work  spent in preparing his tenants to take the field when called upon  to do so, would not be wasted.    Full of these thoughts he rode for some miles from"]]]
