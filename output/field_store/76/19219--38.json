The light of her eye is always the first to rise, and  often the last to set upon man's day of trial. She wields a power more  decisive far than syllogisms in argument or courts of last appeal in  authority.    2. HER LOVE.--Mother! ecstatic sound so twined round our hearts that  they must cease to throb ere we forget it; 'tis our first love; 'tis  part of religion. Nature has set the mother upon such a pinnacle that  our infant eyes and arms are first uplifted to it; we cling to it in  manhood; we almost worship it in old age.    3. HER TENDERNESS.--Alas! how little do we appreciate a mother's  tenderness while living. How heedless are we in youth of all her  anxieties and kindness! But when she is dead and gone, when the  cares and coldness of the world come withering to our hearts, when we  experience for ourselves how hard it is to find true sympathy, how few  to love us, how few will befriend us in misfortune, then it is that we  think of the mother we have lost.    4. HER CONTROLLING POWER.--The mother can take man's whole nature  under her control. She becomes what she has been called \"The Divinity  of Infancy.\" Her smile is its sunshine, her word its mildest law,  until sin and the world have steeled the heart.    [Illustration: A PRAYERFUL AND DEVOTED MOTHER.]    5. THE LAST TIE.--The young man who has forsaken the advice and  influence of his mother has broken the last cable and severed the last  tie that binds him to an honorable and upright life. He has forsaken  his best friend, and every hope for his future welfare may be  abandoned, for he is lost forever, if he is faithless to mother, he  will have but little respect for wife and children.    6. HOME TIES.--The young man or young woman who love their home and  love their mother can be safely trusted under almost any and all  circumstances, and their life will not be a blank, for they seek what  is good. Their hearts will be ennobled, and God will bless them.    [Illustration: HOME AMUSEMENTS.]             *       *       *       *       *    HOME POWER.      \"The mill-streams that turn the clappers of the world arise in  solitary places.\"--HELPS.      \"Lord! with what care hast Thou begirt us round!    Parents first season us. Then schoolmasters    Deliver us to laws. They send us bound    To rules of reason.\"--GEORGE HERBERT.      1. SCHOOL OF CHARACTER.--Home is the first and most important school  of character. It is there that every human being receives his best  moral training, or his worst, for it is there that he imbibes those  principles of conduct which endure through manhood, and cease only  with life.    2. HOME MAKES THE MAN.--It is a common saying, \"Manners make the  man;\" and there is a second, that \"Mind makes the man;\" but truer than  either is a third, that \"Home makes the man.\" For the home-training  includes not only manners and mind, but character. It is mainly in the  home that the heart is opened, the habits are formed, the intellect is  awakened, and character moulded for good or for evil.    3. GOVERN SOCIETY.--From that source, be it pure or impure, issue  the principles and maxims that govern society. Law itself is but the  reflex of homes. The tiniest bits of opinion sown in the minds of  children in private life afterwards issue forth to the world, and  become its public opinion; for nations are gathered out of nurseries,  and they who hold the leading-strings of children may even exercise a  greater power than those who wield the reins of government.    4. THE CHILD IS FATHER OF THE MAN.--The child's character is the  nucleus of the man's; all after-education is but superposition; the  form of the crystal remains the same. Thus the saying of the poet  holds true in a large degree, \"The child is father of the man;\" or  as Milton puts it, \"The childhood shows the man, as morning shows the  day.\" Those impulses to conduct which last the longest and are rooted  the deepest, always have their origin near our birth. It is then that  the germs of virtues or vices, of feelings or sentiments, are first  implanted which determine the character of life.    5. NURSERIES.--Thus homes, which are nurseries of children who grow  up into men and women, will be good or bad according to the power that  governs them. Where the spirit of love and duty pervades the home,  where head and heart bear rule wisely there, where the daily life  is honest and virtuous, where the government is sensible, kind, and  loving, then may we expect from such a home an issue of healthy,  useful, and happy beings, capable as they gain the requisite strength,  of following the footsteps of their parents, of walking uprightly,  governing themselves wisely, and contributing to the welfare of those  about them.    6. IGNORANCE, COARSENESS, AND SELFISHNESS.--On the other hand, if  surrounded by ignorance, coarseness, and selfishness, they will  unconsciously assume the same character, and grow up to adult years  rude, uncultivated, and all the more dangerous to society if placed  amidst the manifold temptations of what is called civilized life.  \"Give your child to be educated by a slave,\" said an ancient Greek  \"and, instead of one slave, you will then have two.\"    7. MATERNAL LOVE.--Maternal love is the visible providence of our  race. Its influence is constant and universal. It begins with the  education of the human being at the outstart of life, and is prolonged  by virtue of the powerful influence which every good mother exercises  over her children through life. When launched into the world, each  to take part in its labors, anxieties, and trials, they still turn  to their mother for consolation, if not for counsel, in their time of  trouble and difficulty. The pure and good thoughts she has implanted  in their minds when children continue to grow up into good acts long  after she is dead; and when there is nothing but a memory of her left,  her children rise up and call her blessed.    8. WOMAN, ABOVE ALL OTHER EDUCATORS, educates humanly. Man is the  brain, but woman is the heart of humanity; he its judgment, she its  feeling; he its strength, she its grace, ornament and solace. Even  the understanding of the best woman seems to work mainly through  her affections. And thus, though man may direct the intellect, woman  cultivates the feelings, which mainly determine the character. While  he fills the memory, she occupies the heart. She makes us love what  he can make us only believe, and it is chiefly through her that we are  enabled to arrive at virtue.    9. THE POOREST DWELLING, presided over by a virtuous, thrifty,  cheerful, and cleanly woman may thus be the abode of comfort, virtue  and happiness; it may be the scene of every enobling relation  in family life; it may be endeared to man by many delightful  associations; furnishing a sanctuary for the heart, a refuge from the  storms of life, a sweet resting-place after labor, a consolation in  misfortune, a pride in prosperity and a joy at all times.    10. THE GOOD HOME IS THUS THE BEST OF SCHOOLS, not only in youth  but in age. There young and old best learn cheerfulness, patience,  self-control, and the spirit of service and of duty. The home is the  true school of courtesy, of which woman is always the best practical  instructor. \"Without woman,\" says the Provencal proverb, \"men were  but ill-licked cubs.\" Philanthropy radiates from the home as from a  center. \"To love the little platoon we belong to in society,\" said  Burke, \"is the germ of all public affections.\" The wisest and best  have not been ashamed to own it to be their greatest joy and happiness  to sit \"behind the heads of children\" in the inviolable circle of  home.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: DAY DREAMING.]             *       *       *       *       *    TO YOUNG WOMEN.      1. TO BE A WOMAN, in the truest and highest sense of the word is to be  the best thing beneath the skies. To be a woman is something more than  to live eighteen or twenty years; something more than to grow to  the physical stature of women; something more than to wear flounces,  exhibit dry goods, sport jewelry, catch the gaze of lewd-eyed men;  something more than to be a belle, a wife, or a mother. Put all these  qualifications together and they do but little toward making a true  woman.    2. BEAUTY AND STYLE are not the surest passports to womanhood--some of  the noblest specimens of womanhood that the world has ever seen have  presented the plainest and most unprepossessing appearance. A woman's  worth is to be estimated by the real goodness of her heart, the  greatness of her soul, and the purity and sweetness of her character;  and a woman with a kindly disposition and well-balanced temper is both  lovely and attractive, be her face ever so plain, and her figure ever  so homely; she makes the best of wives and the truest of mothers.    3. BEAUTY IS A DANGEROUS GIFT.--It is even so. Like wealth, it has  ruined its thousands. Thousands of the most beautiful women are  destitute of common sense and common humanity. No gift from heaven  is so general and so widely abused by woman as the gift of beauty. In  about nine cases in ten it makes her silly, senseless, thoughtless,  giddy, vain, proud, frivolous, selfish, low and mean. I think I have  seen more girls spoiled by beauty than by any other one thing, \"She  is beautiful, and she knows it,\" is as much as to say that she is  spoiled. A beautiful girl is very likely to believe she was made to be  looked at; and so she sets herself up for a show at every window, in  every door, on every corner of the street, in every company at which  opportunity offers for an exhibition of herself.    4. BEWARE OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.--These facts have long since taught  sensible men to beware of beautiful women--to sound them carefully  before they give them their confidence. Beauty is shallow--only skin  deep; fleeting--only for a few years' reign; dangerous--tempting to  vanity and lightness of mind;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13468"],[0,"The New Jerusalem (#5)"],[1," Egypt or even in Palestine is something  of a paradox.  The real English claim is never heard in England and never  uttered by Englishmen.  We do indeed hear a number of false English  claims, and other English claims that are rather irrelevant than false.  We hear pompous and hypocritical suggestions, full of that which so  often accompanies the sin of pride, the weakness of provinciality.  We hear suggestions that the English alone can establish anywhere  a reign of law, justice, mercy, purity and all the rest of it.  We also hear franker and fairer suggestions that the English  have after all (as indeed they have) embarked on a spirited  and stirring adventure; and that there has been a real romance  in the extending of the British Empire in strange lands.  But the real case for these semi-eastern occupations is not  that of extending the British Empire in strange lands.  Rather it is restoring the Roman Empire in familiar lands.  It is not merely breaking out of Europe in the search  for something non-European. It would be much truer to call  it putting Europe together again after it had been broken.  It may almost be said of the Britons, considered as the most  western of Europeans, that they have so completely forgotten  their own history that they have forgotten even their own rights.  At any rate they have forgotten the claims that could reasonably be  made for them, but which they never think of making for themselves.  They have not the faintest notion, for instance, of why hundreds of years  ago an English saint was taken from Egypt, or why an English king  was fighting in Palestine.  They merely have a vague idea that George  of Cappadocia was naturalised much in the same way as George of Hanover.  They almost certainly suppose that Coeur de Lion in his wanderings  happened to meet the King of Egypt, as Captain Cook might happen  to meet the King of the Cannibal Islands.  To understand the past  connection of England with the near East, it is necessary to understand  something that lies behind Europe and even behind the Roman Empire;  something that can only be conveyed by the name of the Mediterranean.  When people talk, for instance, as if the Crusades were nothing  more than an aggressive raid against Islam, they seem to forget  in the strangest way that Islam itself was only an aggressive  raid against the old and ordered civilisation in these parts.  I do not say it in mere hostility to the religion of Mahomet; as will be  apparent later, I am fully conscious of many values and virtues in it;  but certainly it was Islam that was the invasion and Christendom  that was the thing invaded.  An Arabian gentleman found riding  on the road to Paris or hammering on the gates of Vienna can hardly  complain that we have sought him out in his simple tent in the desert.  The conqueror of Sicily and Spain cannot reasonably express surprise at  being an object of morbid curiosity to the people of Italy and France.  In the city of Cairo the stranger feels many of the Moslem merits,  but he certainly feels the militaristic character of the Moslem glories.  The crown of the city is the citadel, built by the great Saladin  but of the spoils of ancient Egyptian architecture; and that fact  is in its turn very symbolical.  The man was a great conqueror,  but he certainly behaved like an invader; he spoiled the Egyptians.  He broke the old temples and tombs and built his own out of fragments.  Nor is this the only respect in which the citadel of Cairo is set  high like a sign in heaven.  The sign is also significant because  from this superb height the traveller first beholds the desert,  out of which the great conquest came.    Every one has heard the great story of the Greeks who cried aloud  in triumph when they saw the sea afar off; but it is a stranger  experience to see the earth afar off.  And few of us, strictly speaking,  have ever seen the earth at all.  In cultivated countries it  is always clad, as it were, in green garments.  The first sight  of the desert is like the sight of a naked giant in the distance.  The image is all the more natural because of the particular formation  which it takes, at least as it borders upon the fields of Egypt,  and as it is seen from the high places of Cairo.  Those who have seen  the desert only in pictures generally think of it as entirely flat.  But this edge of it at least stands up on the horizon, as a line  of wrinkled and hollow hills like the scalps of bald men; or worse,  of bald women.  For it is impossible not to think of such repulsive  images, in spite of real sublimity of the call to the imagination.  There is something curiously hostile and inhuman about the first  appearance of the motionless surges of that dry and dreadful sea.  Afterwards, if the traveller has happened to linger here and there  in the outposts of the desert, has seen the British camp at Kantara  or the graceful French garden town of Ismalia, he comes to take  the desert as a background, and sometimes a beautiful background;  a mirror of mighty reflections and changing colours almost as strange  as the colours of the sea.  But when it is first seen abutting,  and as it were, advancing, upon the fields and gardens of humanity,  then it looks indeed like an enemy, or a long line of enemies;  like a line of tawny wild beasts thus halted with their heads lifted.  It is the feeling that such vain and sterile sand can yet make  itself into something like a mountain range; and the traveller  remembers all the tragedies of the desert, when he lifts up his eyes  to those accursed hills, from whence no help can come.    But this is only a first glimpse from a city set among green fields;  and is concerned rather with what the desert has been in its relation  to men than with what the desert is in itself.  When the mind has  grown used to its monotony, a curious change takes place which I  have never seen noted or explained by the students of mental science.  It may sound strange to say that monotony of its nature becomes novelty.  But if any one will try the common experiment of saying some ordinary  word such as \"moon\" or \"man\" about fifty times, he will find  that the expression has become extraordinary by sheer repetition.  A man has become a strange animal with a name as queer as that of the gnu;  and the moon something monstrous like the moon-calf. Something  of this magic of monotony is effected by the monotony of deserts;  and the traveller feels as if he had entered into a secret,  and was looking at everything from another side.  Something of this  simplification appears, I think, in the religions of the desert,  especially in the religion of Islam.  It explains something of the  super-human hopes that fill the desert prophets concerning the future;  it explains something also about their barbarous indifference  to the past.    We think of the desert and its stones as old; but in one sense  they are unnaturally new.  They are unused, and perhaps unusable.  They might be the raw material of a world; only they are so raw  as to be rejected.  It is not easy to define this quality of  something primitive, something not mature enough to be fruitful.  Indeed there is a hard simplicity about many Eastern things that is  as much crude as archaic.  A palm-tree is very like a tree drawn  by a child--or by a very futurist artist.  Even a pyramid is like  a mathematical figure drawn by a schoolmaster teaching children;  and its very impressiveness is that of an ultimate Platonic abstraction.  There is something curiously simple about the shape in which  these colossal crystals of the ancient sands have been cast.  It is only when we have felt something of this element,  not only of simplicity, but of crudity, and even in a sense  of novelty, that we can begin to understand both the immensity  and the insufficiency of that power that came out of the desert,  the great religion of Mahomet.    In the red circle of the desert, in the dark and secret place,  the prophet discovers the obvious things.  I do not say it  merely as a sneer, for obvious things are very easily forgotten;  and indeed every high civilisation decays by forgetting obvious things.  But it is true that in such a solitude men tend to take very simple  ideas as if they were entirely new ideas.  There is a love of  concentration which comes from the lack of comparison.  The lonely  man looking at the lonely palm-tree does see the elementary truths  about the palm-tree; and the elementary truths are very essential.  Thus he does see that though the palm-tree may be a very simple design,  it was not he who designed it.  It may look like a tree drawn  by a child, but he is not the child who could draw it.  He has not  command of that magic slate on which the pictures can come to life,  or of that magic green chalk of which the green lines can grow.  He sees at once that a power is at work in whose presence  he and the palm-tree are alike little children.  In other words,  he is intelligent enough to believe in God; and the Moslem,  the man of the desert, is intelligent enough to believe in God.  But his belief is lacking in that humane complexity that comes  from comparison.  The man looking at the palm-tree does realise  the simple fact that God made it; while the man looking at  the lamp-post in a large modern city can be persuaded by a hundred  sophistical circumlocutions that he made it himself.  But the man  in the desert cannot compare the palm-tree with the lamp-post,  or even with all the other trees which may be better worth looking  at than the lamp-post. Hence his religion, though true as far  as it goes, has not the variety and vitality of the churches  that were designed by men walking in the woods and orchards.  I speak here of the Moslem type of religion and not of the oriental type  of ornament, which is much older than the Moslem type of religion.  But even the oriental type of ornament, admirable as it often is,  is to"]]]
