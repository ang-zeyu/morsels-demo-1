RECONSTRUCTION      The assembling of the Second Session of the Thirty-ninth Congress may  very properly be made the occasion of a few earnest words on the already  much-worn topic of reconstruction.    Seldom has any legislative body been the subject of a solicitude more  intense, or of aspirations more sincere and ardent.  There are the best  of reasons for this profound interest.  Questions of vast moment, left  undecided by the last session of Congress, must be manfully grappled with  by this.  No political skirmishing will avail.  The occasion demands  statesmanship.    Whether the tremendous war so heroically fought and so victoriously ended  shall pass into history a miserable failure, barren of permanent  results,--a scandalous and shocking waste of blood and treasure,--a  strife for empire, as Earl Russell characterized it, of no value to  liberty or civilization,--an attempt to re-establish a Union by force,  which must be the merest mockery of a Union,--an effort to bring under  Federal authority States into which no loyal man from the North may  safely enter, and to bring men into the national councils who deliberate  with daggers and vote with revolvers, and who do not even conceal their  deadly hate of the country that conquered them; or whether, on the other  hand, we shall, as the rightful reward of victory over treason, have a  solid nation, entirely delivered from all contradictions and social  antagonisms, based upon loyalty, liberty, and equality, must be  determined one way or the other by the present session of Congress.  The  last session really did nothing which can be considered final as to these  questions.  The Civil Rights Bill and the Freedmen's Bureau Bill and the  proposed constitutional amendments, with the amendment already adopted  and recognized as the law of the land, do not reach the difficulty, and  cannot, unless the whole structure of the government is changed from a  government by States to something like a despotic central government,  with power to control even the municipal regulations of States, and to  make them conform to its own despotic will.  While there remains such an  idea as the right of each State to control its own local affairs,--an  idea, by the way, more deeply rooted in the minds of men of all sections  of the country than perhaps any one other political idea,--no general  assertion of human rights can be of any practical value.  To change the  character of the government at this point is neither possible nor  desirable.  All that is necessary to be done is to make the government  consistent with itself, and render the rights of the States compatible  with the sacred rights of human nature.    The arm of the Federal government is long, but it is far too short to  protect the rights of individuals in the interior of distant States.  They must have the power to protect themselves, or they will go  unprotected, spite of all the laws the Federal government can put upon  the national statute-book.    Slavery, like all other great systems of wrong, founded in the depths of  human selfishness, and existing for ages, has not neglected its own  conservation.  It has steadily exerted an influence upon all around it  favorable to its own continuance.  And to-day it is so strong that it  could exist, not only without law, but even against law.  Custom,  manners, morals, religion, are all on its side everywhere in the South;  and when you add the ignorance and servility of the ex-slave to the  intelligence and accustomed authority of the master, you have the  conditions, not out of which slavery will again grow, but under which it  is impossible for the Federal government to wholly destroy it, unless the  Federal government be armed with despotic power, to blot out State  authority, and to station a Federal officer at every cross-road.  This,  of course, cannot be done, and ought not even if it could.  The true way  and the easiest way is to make our government entirely consistent with  itself, and give to every loyal citizen the elective franchise,--a right  and power which will be ever present, and will form a wall of fire for  his protection.    One of the invaluable compensations of the late Rebellion is the highly  instructive disclosure it made of the true source of danger to republican  government.  Whatever may be tolerated in monarchical and despotic  governments, no republic is safe that tolerates a privileged class, or  denies to any of its citizens equal rights and equal means to maintain  them.  What was theory before the war has been made fact by the war.    There is cause to be thankful even for rebellion.  It is an impressive  teacher, though a stern and terrible one.  In both characters it has come  to us, and it was perhaps needed in both.  It is an instructor never a  day before its time, for it comes only when all other means of progress  and enlightenment have failed.  Whether the oppressed and despairing  bondman, no longer able to repress his deep yearnings for manhood, or the  tyrant, in his pride and impatience, takes the initiative, and strikes  the blow for a firmer hold and a longer lease of oppression, the result  is the same,--society is instructed, or may be.    Such are the limitations of the common mind, and so thoroughly engrossing  are the cares of common life, that only the few among men can discern  through the glitter and dazzle of present prosperity the dark outlines of  approaching disasters, even though they may have come up to our very  gates, and are already within striking distance.  The yawning seam and  corroded bolt conceal their defects from the mariner until the storm  calls all hands to the pumps.  Prophets, indeed, were abundant before the  war; but who cares for prophets while their predictions remain  unfulfilled, and the calamities of which they tell are masked behind a  blinding blaze of national prosperity?    It is asked, said Henry Clay, on a memorable occasion, Will slavery never  come to an end?  That question, said he, was asked fifty years ago, and  it has been answered by fifty years of unprecedented prosperity.  Spite  of the eloquence of the earnest Abolitionists,--poured out against  slavery during thirty years,--even they must confess, that, in all the  probabilities of the case, that system of barbarism would have continued  its horrors far beyond the limits of the nineteenth century but for the  Rebellion, and perhaps only have disappeared at last in a fiery conflict,  even more fierce and bloody than that which has now been suppressed.    It is no disparagement to truth, that it can only prevail where reason  prevails.  War begins where reason ends.  The thing worse than rebellion  is the thing that causes rebellion.  What that thing is, we have been  taught to our cost.  It remains now to be seen whether we have the needed  courage to have that cause entirely removed from the Republic.  At any  rate, to this grand work of national regeneration and entire purification  Congress must now address Itself, with full purpose that the work shall  this time be thoroughly done.  The deadly upas, root and branch, leaf and  fibre, body and sap, must be utterly destroyed.  The country is evidently  not in a condition to listen patiently to pleas for postponement, however  plausible, nor will it permit the responsibility to be shifted to other  shoulders.  Authority and power are here commensurate with the duty  imposed.  There are no cloud-flung shadows to obscure the way.  Truth  shines with brighter light and intenser heat at every moment, and a  country torn and rent and bleeding implores relief from its distress and  agony.    If time was at first needed, Congress has now had time.  All the  requisite materials from which to form an intelligent judgment are now  before it.  Whether its members look at the origin, the progress, the  termination of the war, or at the mockery of a peace now existing, they  will find only one unbroken chain of argument in favor of a radical  policy of reconstruction.  For the omissions of the last session, some  excuses may be allowed.  A treacherous President stood in the way; and it  can be easily seen how reluctant good men might be to admit an apostasy  which involved so much of baseness and ingratitude.  It was natural that  they should seek to save him by bending to him even when he leaned to the  side of error.  But all is changed now.  Congress knows now that it must  go on without his aid, and even against his machinations.  The advantage  of the present session over the last is immense.  Where that  investigated, this has the facts.  Where that walked by faith, this may  walk by sight.  Where that halted, this must go forward, and where that  failed, this must succeed, giving the country whole measures where that  gave us half-measures, merely as a means of saving the elections in a few  doubtful districts.  That Congress saw what was right, but distrusted the  enlightenment of the loyal masses; but what was forborne in distrust of  the people must now be done with a full knowledge that the people expect  and require it.  The members go to Washington fresh from the inspiring  presence of the people.  In every considerable public meeting, and in  almost every conceivable way, whether at court-house, school-house, or  cross-roads, in doors and out, the subject has been discussed, and the  people have emphatically pronounced in favor of a radical policy.

Bill Dozier led on his men for three hours at a steady pace until they  came to Sullivan's ranch house in the valley. The place was dark, but  the deputy threw a loose circle of his men around the house, and then  knocked at the front door. Old man Sullivan answered in his bare feet.  Did he know of the passing of young Lanning? Not only that, but he had  sold Andrew a horse. It seemed that Andrew was making a hurried trip;  that Buck Heath had loaned him his horse for the first leg of it, and  that Buck would call later for the animal. It had sounded strange, but  Sullivan was not there to ask questions. He had led Andrew to the corral  and told him to make his choice.    \"There was an old pinto in there,\" said Sullivan, \"all leather in that  hoss. You know him, Joe. Well, the boy runs his eye over the bunch, and  then picks the pinto right off. I said he wasn't for sale, but he  wouldn't take anything else. I figured a stiff price, and then added a  hundred to it. Lanning didn't wink. He took the horse, but he didn't pay  cash. Told me I'd have to trust him.\"    Bill Dozier bade Sullivan farewell, gathered his five before the house,  and made them a speech. Bill had a long, lean face, a misty eye, and a  pair of drooping, sad mustaches. As Jasper Lanning once said: \"Bill  Dozier always looked like he was just away from a funeral or just goin'  to one.\" This night the dull eye of Bill was alight.    \"Gents,\" he said, \"maybe you-all is disappointed. I heard some talk  comin' up here that maybe the boy had laid over for the night in  Sullivan's house. Which he may be a fool, but he sure ain't a plumb  fool. But, speakin' personal, this trail looks more and more interestin'  to me. Here he's left Buck's hoss, so he ain't exactly a hoss  thief--yet. And he's promised to pay for the pinto, so that don't make  him a crook. But when the pinto gives out, Andy'll be in country where  he mostly ain't known. He can't take things on trust, and he'll mostly  take 'em, anyway. Boys, looks to me like we was after the real article.  Anybody weakenin'?\"    It was suggested that the boy would be overtaken before the pinto gave  out; it was even suggested that this waiting for Andrew Lanning to  commit a crime was perilously like forcing him to become a criminal. To  all of this the deputy listened sadly, combing his mustaches. The hunger  for the manhunt is like the hunger for food, and Bill Dozier had been  starved for many a day.    \"Partner,\" said Bill to the last speaker, \"ain't we makin' all the  speed we can? Ain't it what I want to come up to the fool kid and grab  him before he makes a hoss thief or somethin' out of himself? You gents  feed your hosses the spur and leave the thinkin' to me. I got a pile  of hunches.\"    There was no questioning of such a known man as Bill Dozier. The six  went rattling up the valley at a smart pace. Yet Andy's change of horses  at Sullivan's place changed the entire problem. He had ridden his first  mount to a stagger at full speed, and it was to be expected that, having  built up a comfortable lead, he would settle his second horse to a  steady pace and maintain it.    All night the six went on, with Bill Dozier's long-striding chestnut  setting the pace. He made no effort toward a spurt now. Andrew Lanning  led them by a full hour's riding on a comparatively fresh horse, and,  unless he were foolish enough to indulge in another wild spurt, they  could not wear him down in this first stage of the journey. There was  only the chance that he would build a fire recklessly near to the trail,  but still they came to no sign of light, and then the dawn broke and  Bill Dozier found unmistakable signs of a trotting horse which went  straight up the valley. There were no other fresh tracks pointing in the  same direction, and this must be Andy's horse. And the fact that he was  trotting told many things. He was certainly saving his mount for a long  grind. Bill Dozier looked about at his men in the gray morning. They  were a hard-faced lot; he had not picked them for tenderness. They were  weary now, but the fugitive must be still wearier, for he had fear to  keep him company and burden his shoulders.    And now they came to a surprising break in the trail. It twisted from  the floor of the valley up a steep slope, crossed the low crest of the  hills, and finally came out above a broad and open valley.    \"What does he mean,\" said Bill Dozier aloud, \"by breakin' for Jack  Merchant's house?\"          CHAPTER 5      The yell with which Andrew Lanning had shot out of Martindale, and which  only Jasper Lanning had recognized, was no more startling to the men of  the village than it was to Andrew himself. Mingled in an ecstasy of  emotion, there was fear, hate, anger, grief, and the joy of freedom in  that cry; but it froze the marrow of Andy's bones to hear it.    Fear, most of all, was driving him out of the village. Just as he rushed  around the bend of the street he looked back to the crowd of men  tumbling upon their horses; every hand there would be against him. He  knew them. He ran over their names and faces. Thirty seconds before he  would rather have walked on the edge of a cliff than rouse the anger of  a single one among these men, and now, by one blow, he had started them  all after him.    Once, as he topped the rise, the folly of attempting to escape from  their long-proved cunning made him draw in on the rein a little; but the  horse only snorted and shook his head and burst into a greater effort of  speed. After all, the horse was right, Andy decided. For the moment he  thought of turning and facing that crowd, but he remembered stories  about men who had killed the enemy in fair fight, but who had been tried  by a mob jury and strung to the nearest tree.    Any sane man might have told Andrew that those days were some distance  in the past, but Andy made no distinction between periods. He knew the  most exciting events which had happened around Martindale in the past  fifty years, and he saw no difference between one generation and the  next. Was not Uncle Jasper himself continually dinning into his ears  the terrible possibilities of trouble? Was not Uncle Jasper, even in his  old age, religiously exacting in his hour or more of gun exercise each  day? Did not Uncle Jasper force Andy to go through the same maneuvers  for twice as long between sunset and sunrise? And why all these endless  preparations if these men of Martindale were not killers?    It might seem strange that Andy could have lived so long among these  people without knowing them better, but he had taken from his mother a  little strain of shyness. He never opened his mind to other people, and  they really never opened themselves to Andy Lanning. The men of  Martindale wore guns, and the conclusion had always been apparent to  Andy that they wore guns because, in a pinch, they were ready to  kill men.    To Andy Lanning, as fear whipped him north out of Martindale, there  seemed no pleasure or safety in the world except in the speed of his  horse and the whir of the air against his face. When that speed faltered  he went to the quirt. He spurred mercilessly. Yet he had ridden his  horse out to a stagger before he reached old Sullivan's place. Only when  the forefeet of the mustang began to pound did he realize his folly in  exhausting his horse when the race was hardly begun. He went into the  ranch house to get a new mount.    When he was calmer, he realized that he had played his part  well--astonishingly well. His voice had not quivered. His eye had met  that of the old rancher every moment. His hand had been as steady  as iron.    Something that Uncle Jasper had said recurred to him, something about  iron dust. He felt now that there was indeed a strong, hard metal in  him; fear had put it there--or was it fear itself? Was it not fear that  had brought the gun into his hand so easily when the crowd rushed him  from the door of the saloon? Was it not fear that had made his nerves  so rocklike as he faced that crowd and made his get-away?    He was on one side now, and the world was on the other. He turned in the  saddle and probed the thick blackness with his eyes; then he sent the  pinto on at an easy, ground-devouring lope. Sometimes, as the ravine  narrowed, the close walls made the creaking of the saddle leather loud  in his ears, and the puffing of the pinto, who hated work; sometimes the  hoofs scuffed noisily through gravel; but usually the soft sand muffled  the noise of hoofs, and there was a silence as dense as the night around  Andy Lanning.    Thinking back, he felt that it was all absurd and dreamlike. He had  never hurt a man before in his life. Martindale knew it. Why could he  not go back, face them, give up his gun, wait for the law to speak?    But when he thought of this he thought a moment later of a crowd rushing  their horses through the night, leaning over their saddles to break the  wind more easily, and all ready to kill on this man trail.    All at once a great hate welled up in him, and he went on with gritting  teeth.    It was out of this anger, oddly enough, that the memory of the girl came  to him. She was like the falling of this starlight, pure, aloof, and  strange and gentle. It seemed to Andrew Lanning that the instant of  seeing her outweighed the rest of his life, but he would never see her  again. How could he see her, and if he saw her, what would he say to  her? It would not be necessary to speak. One glance would be enough.    But, sooner or later, Bill Dozier would reach him. Why not sooner? Why  not take the chance, ride to John Merchant's ranch, break a way to the  room where the girl slept this night, smash open the door, look at her  once, and then fight his way out?    He swung out of the ravine and headed across the hills. From the crest  the valley was broad and dark below him, and on the opposite"]]]
