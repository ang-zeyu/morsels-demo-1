To shew  how mad they are, let us suppose the war carries out their western  program to the last item. Suppose France rises from the war victorious,  happy and glorious, with Alsace and Lorraine regained, Rheims cathedral  repaired in the best modern trade style, and a prodigious indemnity in  her pocket! Suppose we tow the German fleet into Portsmouth, and leave  Hohenzollern metaphorically under the heel of Romanoff and actually in a  comfortable villa in Chislehurst, the hero of all its tea parties and  the judge of all its gymkhanas! Well, cry the Militarists, suppose it by  all means: could we desire anything better? Now I happen to have a  somewhat active imagination; and it flatly refuses to stop at this  convenient point. I must go on supposing. Suppose France, with its  military prestige raised once more to the Napoleonic point, spends its  indemnity in building an invincible Armada, stronger and nearer to us  than the German one we are now out to destroy! Suppose Sir Edward Grey  remonstrates, and Monsieur Delcasse replies, \"Russia and France have  humbled one Imperial Bully, and are prepared to humble another. I have  not forgotten Fashoda. Stop us if you can; or turn, if you like, for  help to the Germany we have smashed and disarmed!\" Of what use will all  this bloodshed be then, with the old situation reproduced in an  aggravated form, the enemy closer to our shores, a raid far more  feasible, the tradition of \"natural enmity\" to steel the foe, and  Waterloo to be wiped out like Sedan? A child in arms should be able to  see that this idiotic notion of relaxing the military pressure on us by  smashing this or that particular Power is like trying to alter the  pressure of the ocean by dipping up a bucket of water from the North Sea  and pouring it into the Bay of Biscay.    I purposely omit more easterly supposings as to what victorious Russia  might do. But a noble emancipation of Poland and Finland at her own  expense, and of Bosnia and Harzegovina at Austria's, might easily  suggest to our nervous Militarists that a passion for the freedom of  Egypt and India might seize her, and remind her that we were Japan's  ally in the day of Russia's humiliation in Manchuria. So there at once  is your Balance of Power problem in Asia enormously aggravated by  throwing Germany out of the anti-Russian scale and grinding her to  powder. Even in North Africa--but enough is enough. You can _durchhauen_  your way out of the frying pan, but only into the fire. Better take  Nietzsche's brave advice, and make it your point of honour to \"live  dangerously.\" History shews that it is often the way to live long.      *Learning Nothing: Forgetting Everything.*    But let me test the Militarist theory, not by a hypothetical future, but  by the accomplished and irrevocable past. Is it true that nations must  conquer or go under, and that military conquest means prosperity and  power for the victor and annihilation for the vanquished? I have already  alluded in passing to the fact that Austria has been beaten repeatedly:  by France, by Italy, by Germany, almost by everybody who has thought it  worth while to have a whack at her; and yet she is one of the Great  Powers; and her alliance has been sought by invincible Germany. France  was beaten by Germany in 1870 with a completeness that seemed  impossible; yet France has since enlarged her territory whilst Germany  is still pleading in vain for a place in the sun. Russia was beaten by  the Japanese in Manchuria on a scale that made an end forever of the old  notion that the West is the natural military superior of the East; yet  it is the terror of Russia that has driven Germany into her present  desperate onslaught on France; and it is the Russian alliance on which  France and England are depending for their assurance of ultimate  success. We ourselves confess that the military efficiency with which we  have so astonished the Germans is the effect, not of Waterloo and  Inkerman, but of the drubbing we got from the Boers, who we aid probably  have beaten us if we had been anything like their own size. Greece has  lately distinguished herself in war within a few years by a most  disgraceful beating of the Turks. It would be easy to multiply instances  from remoter history: for example, the effect on England's position of  the repeated defeats of our troops by the French under Luxembourg in the  Balance of Power War at the end of the seventeenth century differed  surprisingly little, if at all, from the effect of our subsequent  victories under Marlborough. And the inference from the Militarist  theory that the States which at present count for nothing as military  Powers necessarily count for nothing at all is absurd on the face of it.  Monaco seems to be, on the whole, the most prosperous and comfortable  State in Europe.    In short, Militarism must be classed as one of the most inconsiderately  foolish of the bogus \"sciences\" which the last half century has produced  in such profusion, and which have the common characteristic of revolting  all sane souls, and being stared out of countenance by the broad facts  of human experience. The only rule of thumb that can be hazarded on the  strength of actual practice is that wars to maintain or upset the  Balance of Power between States, called by inaccurate people Balance of  Power wars, and by accurate people Jealousy of Power wars, never  establish the desired peaceful and secure equilibrium. They may exercise  pugnacity, gratify spite, assuage a wound to national pride, or enhance  or dim a military reputation; but that is all. And the reason is, as I  shall shew very conclusively later on, that there is only one way in  which one nation can really disable another, and that is a way which no  civilized nation dare even discuss.    *Are We Hypocrites?*    And now I proceed from general considerations to the diplomatic history  of the present case, as I must in order to make our moral position  clear. But first, lest I should lose all credit by the startling  incompatibility between the familiar personal character of our statesmen  and the proceedings for which they are officially responsible, I must  say a word about the peculiar psychology of English statesmanship, not  only for the benefit of my English readers (who do not know that it is  peculiar just as they do not know that water has any taste because it is  always in their mouths), but as a plea for a more charitable  construction from the wider world.    We know by report, however unjust it may seem to us, that there is an  opinion abroad, even in the quarters most friendly to us, that our  excellent qualities are marred by an incorrigible hypocrisy. To France  we have always been Perfidious Albion. In Germany, at this moment, that  epithet would be scorned as far too flattering to us. Victor Hugo  explained the relative unpopularity of _Measure for Measure_ among  Shakespeare's plays on the ground that the character of the hypocrite  Angelo was a too faithful dramatization of our national character.  Pecksniff is not considered so exceptional an English gentleman in  America as he is in England.    Now we have not acquired this reputation for nothing. The world has no  greater interest in branding England with this particular vice of  hypocrisy than in branding France with it; yet the world does not cite  Tartuffe as a typical Frenchman as it cites Angelo and Pecksniff as  typical Englishmen. We may protest against it as indignantly as the  Prussian soldiers protest against their equally universal reputation for  ferocity in plunder and pillage, sack and rapine; but there is something  in it. If you judge an English statesman, by his conscious intentions,  his professions, and his personal charm, you will often find him an  amiable, upright, humane, anxiously truthful man. If you judge him, as a  foreigner must, solely on the official acts for which he is responsible,  and which he has to defend in the House of Commons for the sake of his  party, you will often be driven to conclude that this estimable  gentleman is, in point of being an unscrupulous superprig and fool,  worse than Caesar Borgia and General Von Bernhardi rolled into one, and  in foreign affairs a Bismarck in everything except commanding ability,  blunt common sense, and freedom from illusion as to the nature and  object of his own diplomacy. And the permanent officials in whose hands  he is will probably deserve all that and something to spare. Thus you  will get that amazing contrast that confronts us now between the  Machiavellian Sir Edward Grey of the Berlin newspapers and the amiable  and popular Sir Edward Grey we know in England. In England we are all  prepared to face any World Congress and say, \"We know that Sir Edward  Grey is an honest English gentleman, who meant well as a true patriot  and friend of peace; we are quite sure that what he did was fair and  right; and we will not listen to any nonsense to the contrary.\" The  Congress will reply, \"We know nothing about Sir Edward Grey except what  he did; and as there is no secret and no question as to what he did, the  whole story being recorded by himself, we must hold England responsible  for his conduct, whilst taking your word for the fact, which has no  importance for us, that his conduct has nothing to do with his  character.\"      *Our Intellectual Laziness.*    The general truth of the situation is, as I have spent so much of my  life in trying to make the English understand, that we are cursed with a  fatal intellectual laziness, an evil inheritance from the time when our  monopoly of coal and iron made it possible for us to become rich and  powerful without thinking or knowing how; a laziness which is becoming  highly dangerous to us now that our monopoly is gone or superseded by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#5)"],[1," Mr.  Damon, that interested me more. So why shouldn't I go at it? Besides, I  have dad to advise me.\"    \"That's right,\" agreed Ned. \"Why shouldn't you? And with such a  contract as you have been offered--\"    \"Bless my bootsoles!\" ejaculated Mr. Damon, getting up and tramping  about the room in his excitement. \"I thought the trolley cars that run  between Shopton and Waterfield were about the fastest things on rails.\"    \"Not much. The trolley car is a narrow and prescribed manner of using  electricity for motive power. The motor runs but one car--or one and a  trailer, at most,\" said Tom. \"As I have pointed out, the problem is to  build a machine that will transmit power enough to draw the enormous  weight of a loaded freight train, and that over steep grades.    \"A motor for each car is a costly matter. That is why trolley car  companies, no matter how many passengers their cars carry, are so often  on the verge of financial disaster. The margin of profit is too narrow.    \"But if you can get a locomotive built that will drag a hundred cars!  Ah! how does that sound?\" demanded Tom. \"See the difference?\"    \"Bless my volts and amperes!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"I should say I do!  Why, Tom, you make the problem as plain as plain can be.\"    \"In theory,\" supplemented Ned Newton, although he meant to suggest no  doubt of his chum's ability to solve almost any problem.    \"You've hit it,\" said Tom promptly. \"I only have a theory so far  regarding such a locomotive. But to the inventor the theory always must  come first. You understand that, Ned?\"    \"I not only appreciate that fact,\" said his chum warmly; \"but I believe  that you are the fellow to show something definite along the line of an  improved electric locomotive. But, whether you can reach the high mark  set by the president of that railroad--\"    \"Two miles a minute!\" breathed Mr. Damon in agreement. \"Bless my  wind-gauge! It doesn't seem possible!\"    Tom Swift shrugged his shoulders. \"It is the impossible that inventors  have to overcome. If we experimenters believed in the impossible little  would be done in this world, to advance mechanical science at least.  Every invention was impossible until the chap who put it through built  his first working model.\"    \"That's understood, old boy,\" said Ned, already busily scratching off  the form of the contract he proposed to show the company's legal  advisers early in the morning.    When he had read over the notes he had made Tom O.K.'d them.  \"That is  about as I had the items set down myself on the sheet that fellow stole  from me.\"    \"Wait!\" exclaimed Ned, as Tom arose from his chair. \"Do you know what  strikes me after your telling me about your second hold-up?\"    \"What's that?\" asked his chum.    \"Are you sure that was the same fellow who stole your wallet?\"    \"Quite sure.\"    \"Then his second attack on you proves that he got wise to the fact that  your notes were in shorthand. He had a chance to study them while you  visited with Mary Nestor.\"    \"Like enough.\"    \"I wonder if it doesn't prove that the fellow has somebody in cahoots  with him right here in Shopton?\" ruminated Ned.    \"Bless my spare tire!\" ejaculated Mr. Damon, who had already started  for the door but now turned back.    \"That's an idea, Ned,\" agreed Tom Swift. \"It would seem that he had  consulted with some superior,\" said the young manager of the Swift  Construction Company. \"This hold-up man may be from the West; but  perhaps he did not follow Bartholomew alone.\"    \"I'd like to know who the other fellow is,\" said Tom thoughtfully. \"I  would know the man who attacked me, both by his bulk and his voice.    \"Me, too,\" put in Mr. Damon. \"Bless my indicator! I'd know the  scoundrel if I met him again.\"    \"The thing to do,\" said Ned Newton confidently, \"is to identify the man  who robbed you tonight as soon as possible and then, if he hangs around  Shopton, to mark well anybody he associates with.\"    \"Perhaps they will not bother me any more,\" said Tom, rather carelessly.    \"And perhaps they will,\" grumbled Mr. Damon. \"Bless my self-starter!  they may try something mean again this very night. Come on, Tom. I want  to run you home. And on the way, I tell you, I've got something to put  up to you myself. It may not promise a small fortune like this electric  locomotive business; but bless my barbed wire fence! my trouble has  more than a little to do with footpads, too.\"    He led the way out of the house and to the motor car again. In a minute  he had started his engine, and Tom, jumping in beside him, was borne  away toward his own home.          Chapter V    Barbed Wire Entanglements      \"This gets us to your particular trouble, Mr. Damon,\" Tom Swift said,  while the motor car was rolling along. \"You intimated that you had  something to consult me about.\"    \"Bless my windshield! I should say I had,\" exclaimed the eccentric  gentleman, swinging around a corner at rather a fast clip.    \"And has it to do with highwaymen?\" asked Tom, much amused.    \"Some of the same gentry, Tom,\" declared Mr. Damon. \"I haven't any  peace of my life, I really haven't!\"    \"Who is troubling you, sir?\"    \"Why, what nonsense that is, to ask that!\" ejaculated the gentleman.  \"If I knew who they were I wouldn't ask odds of anybody. I'd go after  them. As it is, I've left my servant with a gun loaded with rock-salt  watching for them now.\"    \"Burglars?\" exclaimed Tom, with real interest.    \"Chicken-house burglars! That's the kind of burglars they are,\" growled  Mr. Damon. \"Two or three times they have tried to get my prize buff  Orpingtons. Last night they got me out of bed twice fooling around the  chicken house and yard. Other neighbors have lost their hens already. I  don't mean to lose mine. Want you to help me, Tom.\"    \"Is that all that is worrying you, Mr. Damon?\" laughed the young fellow.    \"Bless my radiator! isn't that enough?\"    \"I know you set your clock by those buff Orpingtons,\" agreed Tom.    \"That's right. That ten-months cockerel, Blue Ribbon Junior, never  fails to crow at three-thirty-three to the minute. Bless my combs and  spurs; a wonderful bird!\"    \"But let's see how I can help you regarding the chicken thieves,\" Tom  said, as they sighted the lights of the Swift house beyond the long  stockade fence that surrounded the Construction Company's premises.    \"You know I have a barbed wire entanglement around the whole yard and  hen-house. I don't take any more chances than I can help. Those prize  buff Orpingtons are a great temptation to chicken lovers--both blond  and brunette,\" and in spite of his anxiety, Mr. Damon could chuckle at  his own joke. \"Even your old Eradicate's friend fell for chickens, you  know.\"    \"And Rad promptly cured him of the disease,\" laughed Tom.    \"And I'm trying to cure these others. I've charged my shotgun with  rock-salt--as he did. My servant has orders to shoot anybody who  tampers with my chicken house tonight.    \"But bless my shirt!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, \"I'll never be able to sleep  comfortably until I know that no thief can get at my buff Orpingtons. I  want you to fix it so I can sleep in peace, Tom.\"    He slowed to a stop in front of the Swift's door. Tom stared at his  eccentric friend questioningly.    \"Bless my gaiters!\" ejaculated Mr. Damon, \"don't you see what I want?  And your head already full of this electrified locomotive you are going  to build?\"    \"Hush!\" murmured Tom, with his hand upon his companion's arm.  \"But  what do you want me to do?\"    \"I want you to fix it so that I can turn a current of electricity into  that barbed wire chicken fence at night that will shock any thief that  touches the wires. Not kill 'em--though they ought to be killed!\"  declared the eccentric man. \"But shock 'em aplenty. Can't you do it for  me, Tom Swift?\"    \"Of course it can be done,\" said the young fellow. \"You use electricity  in your house. There is a feed cable in the street.  We will have to  change your lighting switch for another. Fix it with the Electric  Supply Company. It will cost you more--\"    \"Bless my pocketbook! I don't care how much it costs. It will be ample  satisfaction to see just one low-down chicken thief squirming on those  wires.\"    Tom laughed again. He meant to help his friend; but he did not propose  to rig the wires so that anybody, even a chicken thief, would be  seriously injured by the electric current passing through the strands.    \"I'll come down to Waterfield tomorrow in the electric runabout and fix  things up for you. Get a permit from the Electric Supply Company early  in the morning. Tell them I will rig the thing myself. They can send  their inspector afterward.\"    \"That's fine, Tom! What--Ugh! what's this? Another footpad?\"    Out of the darkness beside the fence a bulky figure started.  For a  moment Tom thought it was the same man who had attacked him twice. Then  the very size of this new assailant proved that suspicion to be  unfounded.    \"Koku!\" exclaimed Tom. \"What's the matter with you, Koku?\"    The huge and only half-tamed giant gained the side of the car in  seemingly a single stride. In the dark they could not see his face, but  his voice distinctly showed excitement.    \"Master come good. 'Cause there be enemy. Koku find--Koku kill!\"    \"Bless my magnifying glass!\" ejaculated Mr. Damon. \"That fellow is the  most bloodthirsty individual that I ever saw.\"    \"All in his bringing up,\" chuckled Tom who knew, as the saying is, that  Koku's bark was a deal worse than his bite. \"Killing and maiming his  enemies used to be Koku's principal job. But he has his orders now. He  doesn't kill anybody without consulting me first.\"    \"Bless my buttons!\" murmured Mr. Damon. \"That is certainly a good thing  too. What's the matter with him now?\"    That is exactly what Tom himself wanted to know. He had dropped a hand  upon the arm of the giant as he stood beside the car.    \"Who is the enemy, Koku?\" he asked.    \"Not know, Master. See him"]]]
