Even the garden was not without splashes of  color, where, between rows of vegetables, grew pale, pink-petaled  poppies, seeming to have scarcely a foothold in the rich soil. But  the daintiest, sweetest bed of all, and the one that Mary enjoyed  most, was where the lilies of the valley grew in the shade near a  large, white lilac bush. Here, on a rustic bench beneath an old apple  tree, stitching on her embroidery, she dreamed happy dreams of her  absent lover, and planned for the life they were to live together some  day, in the home he was striving to earn for her by his own manly  exertions; and she assiduously studied and pondered over Aunt Sarah's  teaching and counsel, knowing them to be wise and good.    A short distance from the farm house, where the old orchard sloped  down to the edge of the brook, grew tall meadow rue, with feathery  clusters of green and white flowers; and the green, gold-lined,  bowl-shaped blossoms of the \"Cow Lily,\" homely stepsisters of the  fragrant, white pond lily, surrounded by thick, waxy, green leaves,  lazily floated on the surface of the water from long stems in the bed  of the creek, and on the bank a carpet was formed by golden-yellow,  creeping buttercups.    In the side yard grew two great clumps of iris, or, as it is more  commonly called, \"Blue Flag.\" Its blossoms, dainty as rare orchids,  with lily-like, violet-veined petals of palest-tinted mauve and  purple.    On the sunny side of the old farm house, facing the East, where at  early morn the sun shone bright and warm, grew Aunt Sarah's pansies,  with velvety, red-brown petals, golden-yellow and dark purple. They  were truly \"Heart's Ease,\" gathered with a lavish hand, and sent as  gifts to friends who were ill. The more she picked the faster they  multiplied, and came to many a sick bed \"sweet messengers of Spring.\"    If Aunt Sarah had a preference for one particular flower, 'twas the  rose, and they well repaid the time and care she lavished on them. She  had pale-tinted blush roses, with hearts of deepest pink; rockland and  prairie and hundred-leaf roses, pink and crimson ramblers, but the  most highly-prized roses of her collection were an exquisite, deep  salmon-colored \"Marquis De Sinety\" and an old-fashioned pink moss  rose, which grew beside a large bush of mock-orange, the creamy  blossoms of the latter almost as fragrant as real orange blossoms of  the sunny Southland. Not far distant, planted in a small bed by  themselves, grew old-fashioned, sweet-scented, double petunias,  ragged, ripple, ruffled corollas of white, with splotches of brilliant  crimson and purple, their slender stems scarcely strong enough to  support the heavy blossoms.    In one of the sunniest spots in the old garden grew Aunt Sarah's  latest acquisition. \"The Butterfly Bush,\" probably so named on account  of its graceful stems, covered with spikes of tiny, lilac-colored  blossoms, over which continually hovered large, gorgeously-hued  butterflies, vying with the flowers in brilliancy of color, from early  June until late Summer.    Aunt Sarah's sunflowers, or \"Sonnen Blume,\" as she liked to call them,  planted along the garden fence to feed chickens and birds alike, were  a sight worth seeing. The birds generally confiscated the larger  portion of seeds. A pretty sight it was to see a flock of wild  canaries, almost covering the tops of the largest sunflowers, busily  engaged picking out the rich, oily seeds.    Aunt Sarah loved the golden flowers, which always appeared to be  nodding to the sun, and her sunflowers were particularly fine, some  being as much as fifty inches in circumference.    A bouquet of the smaller ones was usually to be seen in a quaint, old,  blue-flowered, gray jar on the farm house veranda in Summertime.  Earlier in the season blossoms of the humble artichoke, which greatly  resemble small sunflowers, or large yellow daisies, filled the jar.  Failing either of these, she gathered large bouquets of golden-rod or  wild carrot blossoms, both of which grew in profusion along the  country lanes and roadside near the farm. But the old gray jar never  held a bouquet more beautiful than the one of bright, blue \"fringed  gentians,\" gathered by Aunt Sarah in the Fall of the year, several  miles distant from the farm.          CHAPTER VI.    MARY CONFIDES IN AUNT SARAH AND GIVES HER VIEWS ON SUFFRAGE FOR WOMEN.        \"There's no deny'n women are foolish,      God A'mighty made them to match the men.\"      A short time after her arrival at the farm Mary poured into the  sympathetic ear of Aunt Sarah her hopes and plans. Her lover, Ralph  Jackson, to whom she had become engaged the past Winter, held a  position with the Philadelphia Electric Company, and was studying hard  outside working hours. His ambition was to become an electrical  engineer. He was getting fair wages, and wished Mary to marry him at  once. She confessed she loved Ralph too well to marry him, ignorant as  she was of economical housekeeping and cooking.    Mary, early left an orphan, had studied diligently to fit herself for  a kindergarten teacher, so she would be capable of earning her own  living on leaving school, which accounted for her lack of knowledge of  housework, cooking, etc.    Aunt Sarah, loving Mary devotedly, and knowing the young man of her  choice to be clean, honest and worthy, promised to do all in her power  to make their dream of happiness come true. Learning from Mary that  Ralph was thin and pale from close confinement, hard work and study,  and of his intention of taking a short vacation, she determined he  should spend it on the farm, where she would be able to \"mother him.\"    \"You acted sensibly, Mary,\" said her Aunt, \"in refusing to marry Ralph  at the present time, realizing your lack of knowledge of housework and  inability to manage a home. Neither would you know how to spend the  money provided by him economically and wisely, and, in this age of  individual efficiency, a business knowledge of housekeeping is almost  as important in making a happy home as is love. I think it quite as  necessary that a woman who marries should understand housekeeping in  all its varied branches as that the man who marries should understand  his trade or profession; for, without the knowledge of means to gain a  livelihood (however great his love for a woman), how is the man to  hold that woman's love and affection unless he is able by his own  exertions to provide her with necessities, comforts, and, perhaps, in  later years, luxuries? And in return, the wife should consider it her  duty and pleasure to know how to do her work systematically; learn the  value of different foods and apply the knowledge gained daily in  preparing them; study to keep her husband in the best of health,  physically and mentally. Then will his efficiency be greater and he  will be enabled to do his 'splendid best' in whatever position in life  he is placed, be he statesman or hod-carrier. What difference, if an  honest heart beat beneath a laborer's hickory shirt, or one of fine  linen? 'One hand, if it's true, is as good as another, no matter how  brawny or rough.' Mary, do not think the trivial affairs of the home  beneath your notice, and do not imagine any work degrading which tends  to the betterment of the home. Remember, 'Who sweeps a room as for Thy  law, makes that and the action fine.'    \"Our lives are all made up of such small, commonplace things and this  is such a commonplace old world, Mary. 'The commonplace earth and the  commonplace sky make up the commonplace day,' and 'God must have loved  common people, or He would not have made so many of them.' And, what  if we are commonplace? We cannot all be artists, poets and sculptors.  Yet, how frequently we see people in commonplace surroundings,  possessing the soul of an artist, handicapped by physical disability  or lack of means! We are all necessary in the great, eternal plan.  'Tis not good deeds alone for which we receive our reward, but for the  performance of duty well done, in however humble circumstances our lot  is cast. Is it not Lord Houghton who says: 'Do not grasp at the stars,  but do life's plain, common work as it comes, certain that daily  duties and daily bread are the sweetest things of life.' I consider a  happy home in the true sense of the word one of the greatest of  blessings. How important is the work of the housemother and homemaker  who creates the home! There can be no happiness there unless the  wheels of the domestic machinery are oiled by loving care and kindness  to make them run smoothly, and the noblest work a woman can do is  training and rearing her children. Suffrage, the right of woman to  vote; will it not take women from the home? I am afraid the home will  then suffer in consequence. Will man accord woman the same reverence  she has received in the past? Should she have equal political rights?  A race lacking respect for women would never advance socially or  politically. I think women could not have a more important part in the  government of the land than in rearing and educating their children to  be good, useful citizens. In what nobler work could women engage than  in work to promote the comfort and well-being of the ones they love in  the home? I say, allow men to make the laws, as God and nature  planned. I think women should keep to the sphere God made them  for--the home. Said Gladstone, 'Woman is the most perfect when most  womanly.' There is nothing, I think, more despicable than a masculine,  mannish woman, unless it be an effeminate, sissy man. Dr. Clarke  voiced my sentiments when he said: 'Man is not superior to woman, nor  woman to man. The relation of the sexes is one of equality, not of  better or worse, of higher and lower. The loftiest ideal of humanity  demands that each shall be perfect in its kind and not be hindered in  its best work. The lily is not inferior to the rose, nor the oak  superior to the clover; yet the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13559"],[0,"The Backwoods of Canada (#5)"],[1,"rospect, the equal of which I suppose I shall never  see. It would have been something to have thought on and recalled in  after years, when buried in the solitude of the Canadian woods.    The opposite heights, being the Point Levi side, are highly picturesque,  though less imposing than the rock on which the town stands. The bank is  rocky, precipitous, and clothed with trees that sweep down to the  water's edge, excepting where they are cleared away to give place to  white cottages, gardens, and hanging orchards. But, in my opinion, much  less is done with this romantic situation than might be effected if good  taste were exercised in the buildings, and on the disposal of the  ground. How lovely would such a spot be rendered in England or Scotland.  Nature here has done all, and man but little, excepting sticking up some  ugly wooden cottages, as mean as they are tasteless. It is, however,  very possible there may be pretty villas and houses higher up, that are  concealed from the eye by the intervening groves.    The river is considered to be just a mile across from Point Levi to the  landing-stairs below the custom-house in Quebec; and it was a source of  amusement to me to watch the horse ferry-boats that ply between the two  shores. The captain told me there were not less than twelve of these  comical-looking machines. They each have their regular hours, so that  you see a constant succession going or returning. They carry a strange  assortment of passengers; well and ill-dressed; old and young; rich and  poor; cows, sheep, horses, pigs, dogs, fowls, market-baskets,  vegetables, fruit, hay, corn, anything and everything you will see by  turns.    The boat is flat, railed round, with a wicker at each end to admit the  live and dead stock that go or are taken on board; the centre of the  boat (if such it can be called) is occupied by four lean, ill-favoured  hacks, who walk round and round, as if in a threshing machine, and work  the paddles at each side. There is a sort of pen for the cattle.    I am told there is a monument erecting in honour of Wolfe, in the  governor's garden, looking towards the St. Laurence, and to be seen from  Point Levi: the inscription has not yet been decided upon*.  --------------------  [* Since the period in which the author visited Quebec, Wolfe's monument  has been completed. Lord Dalhousie, with equal good feeling and good  taste, has united the names of the rival heroes Wolfe and Montcalm in  the dedication of the pillar--a liberality of feeling that cannot but  prove gratifying to the Canadian French, while it robs the British  warrior of none of his glory.    The monument was designed by Major Young of the 97th Regiment. To the  top of the surbase is fourteen feet from the ground; on this rests a  sarcophagus, seven feet three inches high, from which rises an obelisk  forty-two feet eight inches in height, and the apex is two feet one  inch. The dimensions of the obelisk at the base are six feet by four  feet eight inches. A prize medal was adjudged to J.C. Fisher, LL.D. for  the following inscription on the sarcophagus:--    Mortem virtus communem  Famam Historia  Monumentum Posteritas  Dedit.    On the surbase is an inscription from the pen of Dr. Mills, stating the  fact of the erection of the monument at the expense of Lord Dalhousie,  Governor of Lower Canada, to commemorate the death of Wolfe and  Montcalm, Sept. 13 and 14, 1759. Wolfe fell on the field; and Montcalm,  who was wounded by the single gun in the possession of the English, died  on the next day after the battle.]  --------------------    The captain has just returned from the town. He very kindly brought on  board a basket of ripe apples for me, besides fresh meat, vegetables,  bread, butter, and milk. The deck is all bustle with custom-house  officers, and men unloading a part of the ship's freight, which consists  chiefly of rum, brandy, sugar, and coals, for ballast. We are to leave  Quebec by five o'clock this evening. The _British America_, a superb  steam-vessel of three decks, takes us in tow as far as Montreal. I must  now say farewell.          LETTER III.    Departure from Quebec.--Towed by a Steam-vessel.--Fertility of the  Country.--Different Objects seen in sailing up the River.--Arrival off  Montreal.--The Rapids.    Brig _Laurel_, St. Laurence, below Montreal,  August 17, 1832    IT was after sunset, and a glorious evening, when we left Quebec, which  we did in company with a fine steam-vessel, whose decks and gallery were  crowded with passengers of all descriptions. A brave sight she was to  look upon; ploughing the bright waters which foamed and sung beneath her  paddles; while our brig, with her white sails, followed like a butterfly  in her wake. The heavens were glowing with the richest tints of rose and  saffron, which were reflected below on the bosom of the river; and then  came forth the stars, in the soft blue ether, more brilliant than ever I  saw them at home, and this, I suppose, I may attribute to the superior  purity of the atmosphere. My husband said this evening resembled the  sunsets of Italy.    Our voyage has proved a very pleasant one; the weather moderately warm,  and the air quite clear. We have within the last few days emerged from a  cold, damp atmosphere, such as we often experience in Britain in the  spring, to a delightful summer, moderated by light breezes from the  river.    The further we advance up the country the more fertile it appears. The  harvest is ripening under a more genial climate than that below Quebec.  We see fields of Indian corn in full flower: it is a stately-looking  crop, with its beautiful feathery top tinted with a rich purple hue,  below which tufts of pale green silk are waving in the breeze. When  fully ripe they tell me it is beautiful to see the golden grain bursting  from its silvery sheath; but that it is a crop liable to injury from  frost, and has many enemies, such as bears, racoons, squirrels, mice,  fowls, &c.    We saw several fields of tobacco along the banks of the river, which  looked healthy and flourishing. I believe tobacco is cultivated to some  extent in both provinces; but the Canadian tobacco is not held in such  high esteem as that of Virginia.    There is a flourishing and very pretty town situated at the junction of  the Richelieu river with the St. Laurence, formerly called Sorel, now  called Fort William Henry. The situation is excellent. There are several  churches, a military fort, with mills, and other public buildings, with  some fine stone houses. The land, however, in the immediate vicinity of  the town seems very light and sandy.    I was anxious to obtain a near view of a log-house or a shanty, and was  somewhat disappointed in the few buildings of this kind that I saw along  the banks of the river. It was not the rudeness of the material so much  as the barn-like form of the buildings of this kind, and the little  attention that was paid to the picturesque, that displeased me. In Britain  even the peasant has taste enough to plant a few roses or honeysuckles  about his door or his casement, and there is the little bit of garden  enclosed and neatly kept; but here no such attempt is made to ornament  the cottages. We saw no smiling orchard or grove to conceal the bare log  walls; and as to the little farm-houses, they are uglier still, and look  so pert and ungraceful stuck upon the bank close to the water's edge.    Further back a different style of building and cultivation appears. The  farms and frame-houses are really handsome places, and in good taste,  with clumps of trees here and there to break the monotony of the  clearing. The land is nearly one unbroken level plain, apparently  fertile and well farmed, but too flat for fine scenery. The country  between Quebec and Montreal has all the appearance of having been under  a long state of cultivation, especially on the right bank of the river.  Still there is a great portion of forest standing which it will take  years of labour to remove.    We passed some little grassy islands on which there were many herds of  cattle feeding. I was puzzling myself to know how they got there, when  the captain told me it was usual for farmers to convey their stock to  these island pastures in flat-bottomed boats, or to swim them, if the  place was fordable, and leave them to graze as long as the food  continued good. If cows are put on an island within a reasonable  distance of the farm, some person goes daily in a canoe to milk them.  While he was telling me this, a log-canoe with a boy and a stout lass  with tin pails, paddled across from the bank of the river, and proceeded  to call together their herd.    We noticed some very pleasant rural villages to the right as we  advanced, but our pilot was stupid, and could not, or would not tell  their names. It was Sunday morning, and we could just hear the quick  tinkling of the church bells, and distinguish long lines of caleches,  light waggons, with equestrians and pedestrians hastening along the  avenue of trees that led to the churchyard; besides these, were boats  and canoes crossing the river, bound to the same peaceful haven.    In a part of the St. Laurence, where the channel is rendered difficult  by shoals and sand-banks, there occur little lighthouses, looking  somewhat like miniature watermills, on wooden posts, raised above the  flat banks on which they are built. These droll little huts were  inhabited, and we noticed a merry party, in their holiday clothes,  enjoying a gossip with a party in a canoe below them. They looked clean  and smart, and cheerful enough, but I did not envy them their situation,  which I should think far from healthy.    Some miles below Montreal the appearance of the country became richer,  more civilized, and populous; while the distant line of blue mountains,  at the verge of the horizon, added an interest to the landscape. The  rich tint of ripened harvest formed a"]]]
