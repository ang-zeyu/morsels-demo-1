That she came to me about two years ago for work;  that I liked her, and so hired her; that she has been with us ever since  and--\"    \"Then you will not tell us?\" exclaimed Mr. Gryce.    Her face fell and a look of hesitation crossed it.    \"I doubt if we can do anything unless you do,\" continued he.    Her countenance settled again into a resolved expression.    \"You are mistaken,\" said she; \"if the girl had a secret--as nearly all  girls have, brought low as she has evidently been--it had nothing to do  with her disappearance, nor would a knowledge of it help you in any way.  I am confident of this and so shall hold my peace.\"    She was not a woman to be frightened or cajoled into making revelations  she did not think necessary, and seeing it, Mr. Gryce refrained from  urging her further.    \"However, you will at least tell me this,\" said he, \"what were the  knick-knacks she took away with her from her bureau drawer?\"    \"No,\" said she, \"for they have nothing to do with her abduction. They  were articles of positive value to her, though I assure you of little  importance to any one else. All that is shown by their disappearance is  the fact that she had a moment's time allowed her in which to collect  what she most wanted.\"    Mr. Gryce arose. \"Well,\" said he, \"you have given us a hard sum to  work out, but I am not the man to recoil from anything hard. If I can  discover the whereabouts of this girl I will certainly do it, but you  must help me.\"    \"I, how?\"    \"By inserting a personal in the Herald. You say she loves you; and would  come back if she could. Now whether you believe it or not this is open  to doubt; therefore I would advise that you take some such means as  that to inform her of the anxiety of her friends and their desire to  communicate with her.\"    \"Impossible,\" she cried vehemently. \"I should be afraid--\"    \"Well?\"    \"I might put it that Mrs. D----, anxious about Emily, desires  information of her whereabouts--\"    \"Put it any way you like.\"    \"You had better add,\" said I, speaking for the first time, \"that you  would be willing to pay for information.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Gryce, \"add that.\"    Mrs. Daniels frowned, but made no objection, and after getting as minute  a description as possible of the clothing worn by the girl the night  before, we left the house.        CHAPTER IV. THOMPSON'S STORY      \"An affair of some mystery,\" remarked Mr. Gryce, as we halted at the  corner to take a final look at the house and its environs. \"Why a girl  should choose such a method of descent as that,\"--and he pointed to the  ladder down which we believed her to have come--\"to leave a house of  which she had been an inmate for a year, baffles me, I can tell you. If  it were not for those marks of blood which betray her track, I would  be disinclined to believe any such hare-brained adventure was ever  perpetrated by a woman. As it is, what would'nt I give for her  photograph. Black hair, black eyes, white face and thin figure! what a  description whereby to find a girl in this great city of New York.  Ah!\" said he with sudden gratification, \"here is Mr. Blake again; his  appointment must have been a failure. Let us see if his description will  be any more definite.\" And hurrying towards the advancing figure of that  gentleman, he put some questions to him.    Instantly Mr. Blake stopped, looked at him blankly for a moment, then  replied in a tone sufficiently loud for me to hear:    \"I am sorry, sir, if my description could have done you any good, but I  have not the remotest idea how the girl looked. I did not know till  this morning even, that there was such a person in my house as a  sewing-woman. I leave all such domestic concerns entirely with Mrs.  Daniels.\"    Mr. Gryce again bowed low and ventured another question. The answer came  as before, distinctly to my ears.    \"O, I may have seen her, I can not say about that; I very often run  across the servants in the hall; but whether she is tall or short, light  or dark, pretty or ugly, I know no more than you do, sir.\" Then with  a dignified nod calculated to abash a man in Mr. Gryce's position,  inquired,    \"Is that all?\"    It did not seem to be, Mr. Gryce put another question.    Mr. Blake give him a surprised stare before replying, then courteously  remarked,    \"I do not concern myself with servants after they have left me. Henry  was an excellent valet, but a trifle domineering, something which I  never allow in any one who approaches me. I dismissed him and that was  the end of it, I know nothing of what has become of him.\"    Mr. Gryce bowed and drew back, and Mr. Blake, with the haughty step  peculiar to him, passed by him and reentered his house.    \"I should not like to get into that man's clutches,\" said I, as my  superior rejoined me; \"he has a way of making one appear so small.\"    Mr. Gryce shot an askance look at his shadow gloomily following him  along the pavement. \"Yet it may happen that you will have to run the  risk of that very experience.\"    I glanced towards him in amazement.    \"If the girl does not turn up of her own accord, or if we do not succeed  in getting some trace of her movements, I shall be tempted to place you  where you can study into the ways of this gentleman's household. If the  affair is a mystery, it has its centre in that house.\"    I stared at Mr. Gryce good and roundly. \"You have come across  something which I have missed,\" observed I, \"or you could not speak so  positively.\"    \"I have come across nothing that was not in plain sight of any body who  had eyes to see it,\" he returned shortly.    I shook my head slightly mortified.    \"You had it all before you,\" continued he, \"and if you were not able  to pick up sufficient facts on which to base a conclusion, you mustn't  blame me for it.\"    More nettled than I would be willing to confess, I walked back with  him to the station, saying nothing then, but inwardly determined to  reestablish my reputation with Mr. Gryce before the affair was over.  Accordingly hunting up the man who had patrolled the district the night  before, I inquired if he had seen any one go in or out of the side gate  of Mr. Blake's house on ----- street, between the hours of eleven and  one.    \"No,\" said he, \"but I heard Thompson tell a curious story this morning  about some one he had seen.\"    \"What was it?\"    \"He said he was passing that way last night about twelve o'clock when he  remarked standing under the lamp on the corner of Second Avenue, a group  consisting of two men and a woman, who no sooner beheld him than they  separated, the men drawing back into Second Avenue and the woman coming  hastily towards him. Not understanding the move, he stood waiting her  approach, when instead of advancing to where he was, she paused at the  gate of Mr. Blake's house and lifted her hand as if to open it, when  with a wild and terrified gesture she started back, covering her  face with her hands, and before he knew it, had actually fled in the  direction from which she had come. A little startled, Thompson advanced  and looked through the gate before him to see if possible what had  alarmed her, when to his great surprise, he beheld the pale face of the  master of the house, Mr. Blake himself, looking through the bars from  the other side of the gate. He in his turn started back and before he  could recover himself, Mr. Blake had disappeared. He says he tried the  gate after that, but found it locked.\"    \"Thompson tells you this story, does he?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"it's a pretty wild kind of a tale, and all I have  got to say is, that neither you nor Thompson had better go blabbing  it around too much. Mum is the word where such men as Mr. Blake are  concerned.\" And I departed to hunt up Thompson.    But he had nothing to add to his statement, except that the girl  appeared to be tall and thin, and was closely wrapped about in a shawl.  My next move was to make such inquiries as I could with safety into the  private concerns of Mr. Blake and his family, and discovered--well, such  facts as these:    That Mr. Blake was a man who if he paid but little attention to domestic  affairs was yet rarely seen out of his own house, except upon occasions  of great political importance, when he was always to be found on  the platform at meetings of his constituents. Though to the ordinary  observer a man eminently calculated, from his good looks, fine position,  and solid wealth to enjoy society, he not only manifested a distaste  for it, but even went so far as to refuse to participate in the social  dinners of his most intimate friends; the only table to which he would  sit down being that of some public caterer, where he was sure of finding  none but his political associates assembled.    To all appearance he wished to avoid the ladies, a theory borne out by  the fact that never, even in church, on the street, or at any place of  amusement, was he observed with one at his side. This fact in a  man, young--he was not far from thirty-five at that time--rich, and  marriageable, would, however, have been more noteworthy than it was  if he had not been known to belong to a family eminent for their  eccentricities. Not a man of all his race but had possessed some marked  peculiarity. His father, bibliomaniac though he was, would never treat a  man or a woman with decency, who mentioned Shakspeare to him, nor would  he acknowledge to his dying day any excellence in that divine poet  beyond a happy way of putting words together. Mr. Blake's uncle hated  all members of the legal profession, and as for his grandfather--but you  have heard what a mania of dislike he had against that simple article of  diet, fish; how his friends were obliged to omit it from their bills of  fare whenever they expected him to dinner. If then Mr. Blake chose  to have any pet antipathy--as for women for instance--he surely  had precedent enough in his own family to back him."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11689"],[0,"Are Women People? A Book of Rhymes for Suffrage Times (#5)"],[1," brave, you know,      That was settled long ago;      Ask, however, if you doubt it,      Any man you meet about it;      He will say, I think, like me,      Men are brave as they can be.        Women think they're brave, you say?      Do they really? Well, they may,      But such biased attestation      Is not worth consideration,      For a legal judgment shelves      What they say about themselves.          From a Man's Point of View          Women love self-sacrifice      Suffering and good advice;      If they don't love these sincerely      Then they're not true women really.      Oh, it shocks me so to note      Women pleading for the vote!      Saying publicly it would      Educate and do them good.      Such a selfish reason trips      Oddly from a woman's lips.      But it must not be supposed      I am in the least opposed.      If they want it let them try it.      For I think we'll profit by it.          Glory          I went to see old Susan Gray,      Whose soldier sons had marched away,      And this is what she had to say:        \"It isn't war I hate at all--        'Tis likely men must fight--      But, oh, these flags and uniforms,        It's them that isn't right!      If war must come, and come it does        To take our boys from play,      It isn't right to make it seem        So beautiful and gay.\"        I left old Susan with a sigh;      A famous band was marching by      To make men glad they had to die.          Dependence      (An Englishwoman whose income has stopped owing to her two sons having  joined the English army, was taken care of last night at the Florence  Crittenden Mission.--_Press Clipping_.)        The young men said to their mother,        \"Hear us, O dearest and best!      Time cannot cool or smother        The love of you in our breast;      Here is your place and no other--        Come home and rest.\"        And the mother's heart was grateful        For the love of her cherished ones,      And her labor, bitter and hateful,        She left at the word of her sons,      Till she heard far off the fateful        Voices of guns.        Their love did more enslave her;        They did not understand      That none could guard or save her        When war was on the land,      But herself, and God, who gave her        Heart and mind and hand.          Playthings          Last year the shops were crowded        With soldier suits and guns--      The presents that at Christmas time        We give our little sons;      And many a glittering trumpet        And many a sword and drum;      But as they're made in Germany        This year they will not come.        Perhaps another season        We shall not give our boys      Such very warlike playthings,        Such military toys;      Perhaps another season        We shall not think it sweet      To watch their game of soldier men,        Who dream not of defeat.          Militants          Hippolta, Penthesilea,        Maria Teresa and Joan,      Agustina and Boadicea        And some militant girls of our own--      It would take a brave man and a dull one        To say to these ladies: \"Of course      We adore you while meek,      Timid, clinging and weak,        But a woman can never use force.\"          A Lady's Choice          Her old love in tears and silence had been building her a palace        Ringed by moats and flanked with towers, he had set it on a hill      \"Here,\" he said, \"will come no whisper of the world's alarms and          malice,        In these granite walls imprisoned, I will keep you safe from ill.\"        As he spoke along the highway there came riding by a stranger,        For an instant on her features, he a fleeting glance bestowed,      Then he said: \"My heart is fickle and the world is full of danger,\"        And he offered her his stirrup and he pointed down the road.          The Ballad of Lost Causes      (_About 465 years after Villon_.)          Tell me in what spot remote        Do the antis dwell to-day,      Those who did not want to vote,        Feared their sex's prompt decay?        Where are those who used to say:      \"Home alone is woman's sphere;        Only those should vote who slay\"?      Where the snows of yester-year?        Where are those who used to quote        Nietzsche's words in dread array?      Where the ancient crones who wrote:        \"Women rule through Beauty's sway\"?        And those lovers, where are they,      Who could hold no woman dear        If she had the ballot? Nay!      Where the snows of yester-year?        Prince, inquire no more, I pray,        Whither antis disappear.      Suffrage won; they melt away,        Like the snows of yester-year.          Thoughts at an Anti Meeting          There are no homes in suffrage states,        There are no children, glad and good,      There, men no longer seek for mates,        And women lose their womanhood.        This I believe without debate,        And yet I ask--and ask in vain--      Why no one in a suffrage state        Has moved to change things back again?          A MASQUE OF TEACHERS    AND    THE UNCONSCIOUS SUFFRAGISTS          The Ideal Candidates      (A by-law of the New York Board of Education says: \"No married woman  shall be appointed to any teaching or supervising position in the New  York public schools unless her husband is mentally or physically  incapacitated to earn a living or has deserted her for a period of not  less than one year.\")      CHARACTERS        _Board of Education_.             _Three Would-Be Teachers_.        _Chorus by Board_:        Now please don't waste          Your time and ours        By pleas all based          On mental powers.        She seems to us          The proper stuff        Who has a hus-          Band bad enough.        All other pleas appear to us        Excessively superfluous.        _1st Teacher_:        My husband is not really bad----        _Board_:          How very sad, how very sad!        _1st Teacher_:          He's good, but hear my one excuse----        _Board_:          Oh, what's the use, oh, what's the use?        _1st Teacher_:          Last winter in a railroad wreck          He lost an arm and broke his neck.          He's doomed, but lingers day by day.        _Board_:          Her husband's doomed! Hurray! hurray!        _2nd Teacher_:          My husband's kind and healthy, too----        _Board_:          Why, then, of course, you will not do.        _2nd Teacher_:          Just hear me out. You'll find you're wrong.          It's true his body's good and strong;          But, ah, his wits are all astray.        _Board_:          Her husband's mad. Hip, hip, hurray!        _3rd Teacher_:        My husband's wise and well--the creature!        _Board_:        Then you can never be a teacher.        _3rd Teacher_:        Wait. For I led him such a life        He could not stand me as a wife;        Last Michaelmas, he ran away.        _Board_:        Her husband hates her, Hip, hurray!        _Chorus by Board_:        Now we have found          Without a doubt,        By process sound          And well thought out,        Each candidate          Is fit in truth        To educate          The mind of youth.        No teacher need apply to us        Whose married life's harmonious.                 (_Curtain_.)          The Unconscious Suffragists      \"They who have no voice nor vote in the electing of representatives do  not enjoy liberty, but are absolutely enslaved to those who have  votes.\"--Benjamin Franklin.    \"No such phrase as virtual representation was ever known in law or  constitution.\"--James Otis.    \"But these great cities, says my honorable friend, are virtually, though  not directly represented. Are not the wishes of Manchester, he asks, as  much consulted as those of any other town which sends members to  Parliament? Now, sir, I do not understand how a power which is salutary  when exercised virtually can be noxious when exercised directly. If the  wishes of Manchester have as much weight with us as they would have  under a system which gives representatives to Manchester, how can there  be any danger in giving representatives to Manchester?\"--Lord  Macaulay's Speech on the Reform Bill.    \"Universal suffrage prolongs in the United States the effect of  universal education: for it stimulates all citizens throughout their  lives to reflect on problems outside the narrow circle of their private  interests and occupations: to read about public questions; to discuss  public characters and to hold themselves ready in some degree to give a  rational account of their political faith.\"--Dr. Charles Eliot.    \"But liberty is not the chief and constant object of their (the American  people) desires: equality is their idol; they make rapid and sudden  efforts to obtain liberty and if they miss their aim, resign themselves  to their disappointment; but nothing can satisfy them without equality,  and they would rather perish than lose it.\"--De Tocqueville: Democracy  in America, 1835.    \"A government is for the benefit of all the people. We believe that  this benefit is best accomplished by popular government because in  the long run each class of individuals is apt to secure better  provision for themselves through their own voice in government than  through the altruistic interest of others, however intelligent or  philanthropic.\"--William H. Taft in Special Message.    \"I have listened to some very honest and eloquent orators whose  sentiments were noteworthy for this: that when they spoke of the people,  they were not thinking of themselves, they were thinking of somebody  whom they were commissioned to take care of. And I have seen them shiver  when it was suggested that they arrange to have something done by the  people for themselves.\"--The New Freedom, by Woodrow Wilson."]]]
