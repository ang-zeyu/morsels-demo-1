Partly  owing to business and also to indisposition, it has been nearly impossible  for me to do so. When I think of this oft-discussed affair, I should prefer  going to see him on any other subject. She has not applied to me; so it is  not my business to promote a meeting between her and her son.    With regard to the other matter, I am told that in _this_ case we must have  recourse to compulsion, which will cost me more money, for which I have  chiefly to thank Herr Adlersburg [his advocate]. As Carl's education,  however, must be carried on so far as possible independent of his mother,  for the future as well as the present we must act as I have arranged.    I am, with esteem, your attached friend,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.      252.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Last day of December, 1817.    The old year has nearly passed away, and a new one draws near. May it bring  Y.R.H. no sorrow, but rather may it bestow on you every imaginable  felicity! These are my wishes, all concentrated in the one I have just  expressed. If it be allowable to speak of myself, I may say that my health  is very variable and uncertain. I am unhappily obliged to live at a great  distance from Y.R.H., which shall not, however, prevent my having the  extreme gratification of waiting on you at the first opportunity. I commend  myself to your gracious consideration, though I may not appear to deserve  it. May Heaven, for the benefit of so many whom you befriend, enrich each  day of your life with an especial blessing! I am always, &c., &c.    [K.]      253.    TO G. DEL RIO.    Jan. 6, 1818.    To prevent any mistake I take the liberty to inform you that it is finally  settled my nephew Carl should leave your excellent institution the end of  this month. My hands are also tied with regard to your other proposal, as  if I accepted it, my further projects for Carl's benefit would be entirely  frustrated; but I sincerely thank you for your kind intentions.    Circumstances may cause me to remove Carl even before the end of the month,  and as I may not be here myself, I will appoint some one to fetch him. I  mention this to you now, that it may not appear strange when the time  comes; and let me add, that my nephew and I shall feel grateful to you  through life. I observe that Carl already feels thus, which is to me a  proof that although thoughtless, his disposition is not evil; far less has  he a bad heart. I am the more disposed to augur well of him from his having  been for two years under your admirable guidance.    I am, with esteem, your friend,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.      254.    TO G. DEL RIO.    Vienna, Jan. 24, 1818.    I do not come to you myself, as it would be a kind of leave-taking, and  this I have all my life avoided. Pray accept my heartfelt thanks for the  zeal, rectitude, and integrity with which you have conducted the education  of my nephew. As soon as I am at all settled, we mean to pay you a visit;  but on account of the mother, I am anxious that the fact of my nephew being  with me should not be too much known.    I send you my very best wishes, and I beg especially to thank Frau A.Z. for  her truly maternal care of Carl.    I am, with sincere esteem, yours,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.      255.    TO CZERNY.    MY DEAR GOOD KIND CZERNY,--[1]    I have this moment heard that you are in a position I really never  suspected; you might certainly place confidence in me, and point out how  matters could be made better for you (without any pretensions to patronage  on my part). As soon as I have a moment to myself, I must speak to you.  Rest assured that I highly value you, and am prepared to prove this at any  moment by deeds.    Yours, with sincere esteem,    L. VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Zellner, in his _Blaetter fuer Musik_, relates what follows on  Czerny's own authority:--In 1818 Czerny was requested by Beethoven in a  letter (which he presented some years ago to Cocks, the London music  publisher) to play at one of his last concerts in the large _Redoutensaal_,  his E flat major Concerto, Op. 73. Czerny answered, in accordance with the  truth, that having gained his livelihood entirely for many years past by  giving lessons on the piano, for more than twelve hours daily, he had so  completely laid aside his pianoforte playing, that he could not venture to  attempt playing the concerto properly within the course of a few days  (which Beethoven desired). On which he received, in the above letter, a  touching proof of Beethoven's sympathy. He also learned subsequently that  Beethoven had exerted himself to procure him a permanent situation.]      256.    TO F. RIES,--LONDON.    Vienna, March 5, 1818.    MY DEAR RIES,--    In spite of my wishes it was impossible for me to go to London this year  [see No. 236]. I beg you will apprise the Philharmonic Society that my  feeble health prevented my coming; I trust, however, I shall be entirely  restored this spring, so that in the autumn I may avail myself of their  offers and fulfil all their conditions.    Pray request Neate, in my name, to make no public use of the various works  of mine that he has in his hands, at least not until I come. Whatever he  may have to say for himself, I have cause to complain of him.    Potter[1] called on me several times; he seems to be a worthy man, and to  have a talent for composition. My wish and hope for you is that your  circumstances may daily improve. I cannot, alas! say that such is the case  with my own.... I cannot bear to see others want, I must give; you may  therefore believe what a loser I am by this affair. I do beg that you will  write to me soon. If possible I shall try to get away from this earlier, in  the hope of escaping utter ruin, in which case I shall arrive in London by  the winter at latest. I know that you will assist an unfortunate friend. If  it had only been in my power, and had I not been chained to this place, as  I always have been, by circumstances, I certainly would have done far more  for you.    Farewell; remember me to Neate, Smart, and Cramer. Although I hear that the  latter is a _counter subject_ both to you and to myself, still I rather  understand how to manage people of that kind; so notwithstanding all this  we shall yet succeed in producing an agreeable harmony in London. I embrace  you from my heart. Your friend,    L. VAN BEETHOVEN.    Many handsome compliments to your charming, (and as I hear) handsome wife.    [Footnote 1: Schindler, in his _Biography_ (Vol. II. 254), states that  Cipriani Potter came to Vienna in 1817.]      257.    TO THE RECHNUNGSRATH, VINCENZ HAUSCHKA.[1]    1818.    First and foremost member of our society, and grand cross of the  violon--cello! You wish for an _heroic_ subject, whereas I have none but a  _spiritual_ one! I am contented; still, I think an infusion of the  spiritual would be quite appropriate in such a mass. I have no objections  to H. v. Bernard, but you must pay him; I do not speak of myself. As you  call yourselves \"Friends of Music,\" it is only natural that you should  expect a great deal to be done on the score of friendship.    Now farewell, my good Hauschka! As for myself, I wander about here with  music paper, among the hills and dales and valleys, and scribble a great  deal to get my daily bread; for I have brought things to such a pass in  this mighty and ignominious _land of the Goths and Vandals_, that in order  to gain time for a great composition, I must always previously _scrawl  away_ a good deal for the sake of money, to enable me to complete an  important work.    However, my health is much improved, and if the matter is urgent, I can do  as you wish now.    In haste, your friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Hauschka was at that time on the committee, and agent for the  \"Friends to Music\" who commissioned Beethoven to write an Oratorio in 1815.  Schindler is of opinion that the repeated performance of the Abbe Stadler's  heroic Oratorio, _Die Befreiung von Jerusalem_, was the cause of the  Society in 1818 bespeaking, through Hauschka, \"An oratorio of the heroic  order.\"]      258.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1819.    I have the honor to send the masterly variations[1] of Y.R.H. by the  copyist Schlemmer, and to-morrow I shall come in person to wait upon  Y.R.H., and much rejoice at being able to serve as a companion to my  illustrious pupil on the path of fame.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: The letters 258 and 259, allude to the pianoforte variations  composed by the Archduke Rudolph and dedicated to his instructor.]      259.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Jan. 1, 1819.    All that can be comprehended in one wish, or individually named,--health,  happiness, and prosperity,--all are included in the prayer I offer up for  Y.R.H. on this day. May the wish that I also form for myself be graciously  accepted by Y.R.H., namely, that I may continue to enjoy the favor of  Y.R.H. A dreadful occurrence[1] has lately taken place in my family, which  for a long time stunned my senses, and to this must be ascribed my not  having waited on Y.R.H., nor taken any notice of the masterly variations of  my much-honored and illustrious pupil, and favorite of the Muses. The  gratitude I feel for the surprise and the honor you have done me, I dare  not venture to express either verbally or in writing, for I am _too far  beneath you_, even if I _could_ or wished ever so ardently _to return like  for like_. May Heaven accept and listen with peculiar favor to my prayers  for Y.R.H.'s health. In the course of a few days I trust I shall myself  hear the masterpiece Y.R.H. has sent to me, and nothing will rejoice me  more than to assist Y.R.H. as early as possible, in taking the place  already prepared for you on Parnassus.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: The \"dreadful occurrence\" which took place in the end of 1818  in Beethoven's family cannot be discovered.]      260.    TO RIES.    Vienna, April [March?] 30, 1819.

Handel devoted his  abundant leisure to composition, at which he worked with much ardor.  His fame was making great strides, and when the Peace of Utrecht was  signed and a Thanksgiving service was to be held in St. Paul's, he was  commissioned to compose a Te Deum and Jubilate. To show appreciation  for his work and in honor of the event, Queen Anne awarded Handel a  life pension of a thousand dollars.    The death of the Queen, not long after, brought the Elector of Hanover  to England, to succeed her as George I. It was not likely that King  George would look with favor on his former Capellmeister, who had so  long deserted his post. But an opportunity soon came to placate his  Majesty. A royal entertainment, with decorated barges on the Thames  was arranged. An orchestra was to furnish the music, and the Lord  Chamberlain commissioned Handel to compose music for the fete. He  wrote a series of pieces, since known as \"Water Music.\" The king was  greatly delighted with the music, had it repeated, and learning that  Handel conducted in person, sent for him, forgave all and granted him  another pension of a thousand dollars. He was also appointed teacher  to the daughters of the Prince of Wales, at a salary of a thousand  a year. With the combined sum (three thousand dollars) which he now  received, he felt quite independent, indeed a man of means.    Not long after this Handel was appointed Chapel master to the Duke  of Chandos, and was expected to live at the princely mansion he  inhabited. The size and magnificence of The Cannons was the talk of  the country for miles around. Here the composer lived and worked,  played the organ in the chapel, composed church music for the service  and wrote his first English oratorio, \"Esther.\" This was performed in  the Duke's chapel, and the Duke on this occasion handed the composer  five thousand dollars. Numerous compositions for the harpsichord  belong to this period, among them the air and variations known as  \"The Harmonious Blacksmith.\" The story goes that Handel was walking  to Cannons through the village of Edgeware, and being overtaken by a  heavy shower, sought shelter in the smithy. The blacksmith was singing  at his work and his hammer kept time with his song. The composer was  struck with the air and its accompaniment, and as soon as he reached  home, wrote out the tune with the variations. This story has been  disputed, and it is not known whether it is true or not.    When Handel first came to London, he had done much to encourage the  production of opera in the Italian style. Later these productions  had to be given up for lack of money, and the King's Theater remained  closed for a long time. Finally a number of rich men formed a society  to revive opera in London. The King subscribed liberally to the  venture. Handel was at once engaged as composer and impressario. He  started work on a new opera and when that was well along, set out for  Germany, going to Dresden to select singers. On his return he stopped  at Halle, where his mother was still living, but his old teacher had  passed away.    The new opera \"Radamisto\" was ready early in 1720, and produced at the  Royal Academy of Music, as the theater was now called. The success  of the production was tremendous. But Handel, by his self-will had  stirred up envy and jealousy, and an opposition party was formed,  headed by his old enemy from Hamburg, Buononcini, who had come to  London to try his fortunes. A test opera was planned, of which Handel  wrote the third act, Buononcini the second and a third musician the  first. When the new work was performed, the third act was pronounced  by the judges much superior to the second. But Buononcini's friends  would not accept defeat, and the battle between all parties was  violent. Newspapers were full of it, and many verses were written.  Handel cared not a whit for all this tempest, but calmly went his way.    In 1723, his opera \"Ottone\" was to be produced. The great singer  Cuzzoni had been engaged, but the capricious lady did not arrive in  England till the rehearsals were far advanced, which of course did not  please the composer. When she did appear she refused to sing the aria  as he had composed it. He flew into a rage, took her by the arm and  threatened to throw her out of the window unless she obeyed. The  singer was so frightened by his anger that she sang as he directed,  and made a great success of the aria.    Handel's industry in composing for the Royal Academy of Music  was untiring. For the first eight years from the beginning of the  Society's work he had composed and produced fourteen operas. During  all this time, his enemies never ceased their efforts to destroy him.  The great expense of operatic production, the troubles and quarrels  with singers, at last brought the Academy to the end of its resources.  At this juncture, the famous \"Beggar's Opera,\" by John Gay, was  brought out at a rival theater. It was a collection of most beautiful  melodies from various sources, used with words quite unworthy of them.  But the fickle public hailed the piece with delight, and its success  was the means of bringing total failure to the Royal Academy. Handel,  however, in spite of the schemes of his enemies, was determined to  carry on the work with his own fortune. He went again to Italy to  engage new singers, stopping at Halle to see his mother who was ill.  She passed away the next year at the age of eighty.    Handel tried for several years to keep Italian opera going in London,  in spite of the lack of musical taste and the opposition of his  enemies; but in 1737, he was forced to give up the struggle. He was  deeply in debt, his whole fortune of ten thousand pounds had been  swept away and his health broken by anxiety. He would not give up;  after a brief rest, he returned to London to begin the conflict anew.  The effort to re-awaken the English public's interest in Italian opera  seemed useless, and the composer at last gave up the struggle. He was  now fifty-five, and began to think of turning his attention to more  serious work. Handel has been called the father of the oratorio; he  composed at least twenty-eight works in this style, the best  known being \"Samson,\" \"Israel in Egypt,\" \"Jephtha,\" \"Saul,\" \"Judas  Maccabaeus\" and greatest of all, the \"Messiah.\"    The composer conceived the idea of writing the last named work in  1741. Towards the end of this year he was invited to visit Ireland  to make known some of his works. On the way there he was detained at  Chester for several days by contrary winds. He must have had the score  of the \"Messiah\" with him, for he got together some choir boys to try  over a few of the choral parts. \"Can you sing at sight?\" was put to  each boy before he was asked to sing. One broke down at the start.  \"What de devil you mean!\" cried the impetuous composer, snatching the  music from him. \"Didn't you say you could sing at sight?\"    \"Yes sir, but not at _first_ sight.\"    The people of Dublin warmly welcomed Handel, and the new oratorio,  the \"Messiah,\" was performed at Music Hall, with choirs of both  cathedrals, and with some concertos on the organ played by the  composer. The performance took place, April 13, 1742. Four hundred  pounds were realized, which were given to charity. The success was so  great that a second performance was announced. Ladies were requested  to come without crinoline, thereby providing a hundred more seats than  at the first event.    The Irish people were so cordial, that the composer remained almost  a year among them. For it was not till March 23, 1743, that the  \"Messiah\" was performed in London. The King was one of the great  audience who heard it. All were so deeply impressed by the Hallelujah  chorus, that with the opening words, \"For the Lord God omnipotent  reigneth,\" the whole audience, including the King, sprang to their  feet, and remained standing through the entire chorus. From that time  to this it has always been the custom to stand during this chorus,  whenever it is performed.    Once started on this line of thought, one oratorio after another  flowed from his prolific pen, though none of them proved to be as  exalted in conception as the \"Messiah.\" The last work of this style  was \"Jephtha,\" which contains the beautiful song, \"Waft her, angels.\"  While engaged in composing this oratorio, Handel became blind, but  this affliction did not seem to lessen his power for work. He was now  sixty-eight, and had conquered and lived down most of the hostility  that had been so bitter against him. His fortunes also constantly  improved, so that when he passed away he left twenty thousand pounds.    The great composer was a big man, both physically and mentally. A  friend describes his countenance as full of fire; \"when he smiled it  was like the sun bursting out of a black cloud. It was a sudden flash  of intelligence, wit and good humor, which illumined his countenance,  which I have hardly ever seen in any other.\" He could relish a joke,  and had a keen sense of humor. Few things outside his work interested  him; but he was fond of the theater, and liked to go to picture sales.  His fiery temper often led him to explode at trifles. No talking among  the listeners could be borne by him while he was conducting. He did  not hesitate to visit violent abuse on the heads of those who ventured  to speak while he was directing and not even the presence of royalty  could restrain his anger.    Handel was always generous in assisting those who needed aid, and he  helped found the Society for Aiding Distressed Musicians. His last  appearance in public, was at a performance of the \"Messiah,\" at Covent  Garden, on April 6, 1759. His death occurred on the 14th of the same  month, at the house in Brook Street where he had lived for many years.  Thus, while born in the same year as Sebastian Bach, he"]]]
