Segun el contexto de la Oracion estos dichos modos de Subjuntivo  hacen a nuestros tiempos de castellano Preterito perfecto, imperfecto,  y plusquam perfecto, y Futuro de Subjuntivo, aplicandolos debidamente  como ya dixe en su lugar. De este Verbo _Ara_, o _Dar_ sale un numero  crecido de verbos; y lo mismo sucede con casi todos los verbos; de que  resulta un numero grande de inflexiones como deribadas del principal,  [-u] original. Salen de Ara:      _Arsa_,        Dar mucho o a muchos. Por esto le llamo verbo plural.    _Aramu_,       Darse, o entregarse uno a otro, los dos.    _Arsapu_,      Darse unos a otros.    _Arapu_,       Darse uno a si mismo, o entregarse.    _Aracsi_,      Dar bien perfectamente.    _Arasi_,       Mandar dar.    _Aramiste_,    Suplicar dar.    _Arasu_,       Ir a dar.    _Arana_,       Ir a dar------_Arastapse_,          Se dio tiempo ha.    _Araini_,      Venir a dar------_Arastap_,         Se dio tiempo ha.    _Arau_,        Quando se da: o el tiempo de dar.    _Aragne_,      Se da------_Arargnis_,              Se dio poco ha.    _Aragnit_,     No sea que le de.    Esta voz _Ara_ tiene tres significados. Es verbo, y significa _Dar_.  Es conjuncion, y significa _Y_. Es adverbio, y significa _despues_,  o _luego_. Tambien es palabra de mofa, que la usan los muchacos.    OTRO EXEMPLO.    Omitidas las conjugaciones de este verbo, v.g.: _Oio_, Coger; saquemos  todos sus deribados, como arriba del verbo _Ara_.      Oio: coger. Verbo particular, o singular.    Oiso: coger mucho, o muchos. Verbo plural.    _Oio_,              Coger.    _Oiso_,             Coger mucho, o muchos.    _Oimu_,             Cogerse uno a otro; los dos.    _Oisopu_,           Cogerse muchos a muchos.    _Oipu_,             Cogerse a si mismo.    _Oiocsi_,           Coger bien perfectamente.    _Oiosi_,            Mandar coger.    _Oiomiste_,         Suplicar coger.    _Oiou_, o _oiohu_,  Quando se coja, o en tiempo de coger.    _Oiona_,            Ir a coger.    _Oini_,             Venir a coger.    _Oiosu_,            Ir a coger.    _Oiogne_,           Le coge.    _Oioinicane_,       Quando le coge.    _Oioguit_,          No sea que le coja.    _Oiostapse_,        La cogio, o cogieron, o fue cogida.    _Oiostap_,          La cogio, o (lo mismo).    _Oiognis_,          Fue cogida, o la cogieron, &c.    Esta voz _Oio_ se toma tambien por hacer; v.g.: _Ista ca oiona?_  Que voy a hacer? _?Istam tina oio?_ Que haces tu?    Siete verbos nacen del primitivo; y algunos le siguen en la conjugacion,  y otros no. Unos son verbos plurales; y otros tienen los dos numeros  singular y plural. Veamoslo en los exemplos dichos.      _Ara;_      Dar. Verbo primitivo, y regular conjugable por los                  tiempos dichos.    _Arsa;_     Dar a muchos, o mucho. Verbo plural que se conjuga                  en numero singular y plural.    _Aramu_.    Tiene solo plural. Irregular.    _Arsapu_.   Regular.    _Arapu_.    Es lo mismo en la conjugacion, que el primitivo.    _Aracsi_.   Tambien sigue a su original.    _Arasi_.    Se conjuga lo mismo que el primitivo.    _Aramiste_. Tiene la misma conjugacion que su primitivo.    Lo mismo se verifica en el otro exemplo, y en la mayor parte de verbos.  Mas para no confundirse, solo dixe del dicho exemplo.      _Oio;_      Coger. Verbo primitivo y regular, que se conjuga por                  todos los dichos tiempos.    _Oiso_.     Verbo plural, que se conjuga por tiempos, y numeros                  singular y plural.    _Oimu;_     Solo tiene plural. Irregular.     u _Oromu_.    _Oisopu_.   Regular.    _Oipu_.     Es lo mismo en todo que el primitivo.    _Oiocsi_.   Tambien sigue a su original.    _Oiosi_.    Se conjuga lo mismo que el primitivo.    _Oiomiste_. Tiene la misma conjugacion que su primitivo.    Voy a repetir todos los verbos plurales, y regulares deribados, y un  irregular, que salen de un verbo solamente.      1. Ara.       Arsa.    2. Arapu.       Arsapu.    3. Arasi.       Arsasi.    4. Aracsi.       Arsacsi.    5. Aramiste.       Arsamiste.    6. Araini.       Arsaini.    7. Arana.       Arsana.    8. Arsaa.       Arsasu.    9. Arahu.       Arsahu.   10. Arainicane.       Arsainicane.   11. Aragne.       Arsagne.   12. Araguit.       Arsaguit.   13. Arastap.       Arsastap.   14. Arastapse.       Arsastapse.   15. Araguis.       Arsaguis.   16. Aramu.       Arsamu.    Tenemos aqui 32 palabras, que las 31 de sola una; y conjugadas las que  son verbos regulares, plurales, y el irregular, saldria un numero muy  considerable que llenaria algunas paginas de pliego entero: por lo que  las omito; pues aunque no seria superflua, seria a lo menos enfadosisima  tanta conjugacion de un solo verbo. Nota tambien: que todos los que  estan numerados, son verbos _singulares_, y los no numerados son  _plurales_; y seis solos son conjugables por todos los tiempos dichos;  y uno solo es irregular, porque solo tiene numero plural, y porque  siempre se conjuga por _nos_, _vos_, _illae_, vel _illi_, 1^a 2^a y 3^a  persona.    Hasta aqui solo he hablado de los tiempos, de la conjugacion, y de los  modos de los verbos de este idioma. Mas ahora es preciso reunir todo lo  dicho en pocas palabras, para la mas facil comprehension. Los tiempos  que esta lengua admite se determinan, o por los adverbios que anteceden,  o se posponen al verbo; o por la terminacion del mismo verbo, haciendole  presente, preterito, o futuro; de lo que nada queda que advertir, y  entendidos bien los tiempos queda explicada la conjugacion per ellos.  Tambien he tratado del Infinitivo de presente, que es como suena el  verbo en qualquiera de las personas del presente de Indicativo; mas es  preciso hablar del Infinitivo preterito y futuro; del Gerundio, del  Participio tambien de presente, preterito y futuro.      Infinitivo de presente,          _Ara_: Dar.    Infinitivo de preterito,         _Arapis_: Haber dado.    Infinitivo de futuro,            _Et ara_: Haber dado."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11093"],[0,"Trailin'!

Odd, isn't  it?\" He grew excited as he talked, his eyes gleaming with dancing points  of fire. \"And I'll tell you this, sir: I'd rather be out in the country  where men still wear guns, where the sky isn't stained with filthy coal  smoke, where there's an horizon wide enough to breathe in, where there's  man-talk instead of this damned chatter over tea-cups--\"    \"Stop!\" cried John Woodbury, and leaned forward, \"no matter what fool  ideas you get into your head--you're going to be a _gentleman_!\"    The swaying forward of that mighty body, the outward thrust of the jaws,  the ring of the voice, was like the crashing of an ax when armoured men  meet in battle. The flicker in the eyes of Anthony was the rapier which  swerves from the ax and then leaps at the heart. For a critical second  their glances crossed and then the habit of obedience conquered.    \"I suppose you know, sir.\"    The father stared gloomily at the floor.    \"You're sort of mad, Anthony?\"    Perhaps there was nothing more typical of Anthony than that he never  frowned, no matter how angered he might be. Now the cold light passed  from his eyes. He rose and passed behind the chair of the elder man,  dropping a hand upon those massive shoulders.    \"Angry with myself, sir, that I should so nearly fall out with the  finest father that walks the earth.\"    The eyes of the grey man half closed and a semblance of a smile touched  those stiff, stern lips; one of the great work-broken hands went up and  rested on the fingers of his son.    \"And there'll be no more of this infernal Western nonsense that you're  always reverting to? No more of this horse-and-gun-and-hell-bent-away  stuff?\"    \"I suppose not,\" said Anthony heavily.    \"Well, Anthony, sit down and tell me about tonight.\"    The son obeyed, and finally said, with difficulty: \"I didn't go to the  Morrison supper.\"    A sudden cloud of white rose from the bowl of Woodbury's pipe.    \"But I thought--\"    \"That it was a big event? It was--a fine thing for me to get a bid to;  but I went to the Wild West show instead. Sir, I know it was childish,  but--I couldn't help it! I saw the posters; I thought of the  horse-breaking, the guns, the swing and snap and dash of galloping men,  the taint of sweating horses--and by God, sir, I _couldn't_ stay away!  Are you angry?\"    It was more than anger; it was almost fear that widened the eye of  Woodbury as he stared at his son. He said at last, controlling himself:  \"But I have your word; you've given up the thought of this Western  life?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Anthony, with a touch of despair, \"I have given it up, I  suppose. But, oh, sir--\" He stopped, hopeless.    \"And what else happened?\"    \"Nothing to speak of.\"    \"After you come home you don't usually change your clothes merely for  the pleasure of sitting with me here.\"    \"Nothing escapes you, does it?\" muttered Anthony.    \"In your set, Anthony, that's what they'd call an improper question.\"    \"I could ask you any number of questions, sir, for that matter.\"    \"Well?\"    \"That room over there, for instance, which you always keep locked. Am I  never to have a look at it?\"    He indicated a door which opened from the library.    \"I hope not.\"    \"You say that with a good deal of feeling. But there's one thing more  that I have a right to hear about. My mother! Why do you never tell me  of her?\"    The big man stirred and the chair groaned beneath him.    \"Because it tortures me to speak of her, Anthony,\" said the husky voice.  \"Tortures me, lad!\"    \"I let the locked room go,\" said Anthony firmly, \"but my mother--she is  different. Why, sir, I don't even know how she looked! Dad, it's my  right!\"    \"Is it? By God, you have a right to know exactly what I choose to tell  you--no more!\"    He rose, strode across the room with ponderous steps, drew aside the  curtains which covered the view of the garden below, and stared for a  time into the night. When he turned he found that Anthony had risen--a  slender, erect figure. His voice was as quiet as his anger, but an  inward quality made it as thrilling as the hoarse boom of his father.    \"On that point I stick. I must know something about her.\"    \"Must?\"    \"In spite of your anger. That locked room is yours; this house and  everything in it is yours; but my mother--she was as much mine as yours,  and I'll hear more about her--who she was, what she looked like, where  she lived--\"    The sharply indrawn breath of John Woodbury cut him short.    \"She died in giving birth to you, Anthony.\"    \"Dear God! She died for me?\"    And in the silence which came over the two men it seemed as if another  presence were in the room. John Woodbury stood at the fire-place with  bowed head, and Anthony shaded his eyes and stared at the floor until he  caught a glimpse of the other and went gently to him.    He said: \"I'm sorrier than a lot of words could tell you. Will you sit  down, sir, and let me tell you how I came to press home the question?\"    \"If you want to have it that way.\"    They resumed their chairs.          CHAPTER V      ANTHONY IS LEFT IN THE DARK    \"It will explain why I changed my clothes after I came home. You see,  toward the end of the show a lot of the cowboys rode in. The ringmaster  was announcing that they could ride anything that walked on four feet  and wore a skin, when up jumped an oldish fellow in a box opposite mine  and shouted that he had a horse which none of them could mount. He  offered five hundred dollars to the man who could back him; and made it  good by going out of the building and coming back inside of five minutes  with two men leading a great stallion, the ugliest piece of horseflesh  I've ever seen.    \"As they worked the brute down the arena, it caught sight of my white  shirt, I suppose, for it made a dive at me, reared up, and smashed its  forehoofs against the barrier. By Jove, a regular maneater! Brought my  heart into my mouth to see the big devil raging, and I began to yearn to  get astride him and to--well, just fight to see which of us would come  out on top. You know?\"    The big man moistened his lips; he was strangely excited.    \"So you climbed into the arena and rode the horse?\"    \"Exactly! I knew you'd understand! After I'd ridden the horse to a  standstill and climbed off, a good many people gathered around me. One  of them was a big man, about your size. In fact, now that I look back at  it, he was a good deal like you in more ways than one; looked as if time  had hardened him without making him brittle. He came to me and said:  'Excuse me, son, but you look sort of familiar to me. Mind telling me  who your mother was?' What could I answer to a--\"    A shadow fell across Anthony from the rising height of his father. As he  looked up he saw John Woodbury glance sharply, first toward the French  windows and then at the door of the secret room.    \"Was that all, Anthony?\"    \"Yes, about all.\"    \"I want to be alone.\"    The habit of automatic obedience made Anthony rise in spite of the  questions which were storming at his lips.    \"Good-night, sir.\"    \"Good-night, my boy.\"    At the door the harsh voice of his father overtook him.    \"Before you leave the house again, see me, Anthony.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    He closed the door softly, as one deep in thought, and stood for a time  without moving. Because a man had asked him who his mother was, he was  under orders not to leave the house. While he stood, he heard a faint  click of a snapping lock within the library and knew that John Woodbury  had entered the secret room.    In his own bedroom he undressed slowly and afterward stood for a long  time under the shower, rubbing himself down with the care of an athlete,  thumbing the soreness of the wild ride out of the lean, sinewy muscles,  for his was a made strength built up in the gymnasium and used on the  wrestling mat, the cinder path, and the football field. Drying himself  with a rough towel that whipped the pink into his skin, he looked down  over his corded, slender limbs, remembered the thick arms and Herculean  torso of John Woodbury, and wondered.    He sat on the edge of his bed, wrapped in a bathrobe, and pondered.  Stroke by stroke he built the picture of that dead mother, like a  painter who jots down the first sketch of a large composition. John  Woodbury, vast, blond, grey-eyed, had given him few of his physical  traits. But then he had often heard that the son usually resembled the  mother. She must have been dark, slender, a frail wife for such a giant;  but perhaps she had a strength of spirit which made her his mate.    As the picture drew out more clearly in the mind of Anthony, he turned  from the lighted room, threw open a window, and leaned out to breathe  the calm, damp air of night.    It was infinitely cool, infinitely fresh. To his left a row of young  trees darted their slender tops at the sky like shadowy spearheads. The  smell of wet leaves and the wet grass beneath rose up to him. To the  right, for his own room stood in a wing of the mansion, the house  shouldered its way into the gloom, a solemn, grey shadow, netted in a  black tracery of climbing vine. In all the stretch of wall only two  windows were lighted, and those yellow squares, he knew, belonged to his  father. He had left the secret room, therefore.    As he watched, a shadow brushed slowly across one of the drawn shades,  swept the second, and returned at once in the opposite direction. Back  and forth, back and forth, that shadow moved, and as his eye grew  accustomed to watching, he caught quite clearly the curve of the  shoulders and the forward droop of the head.    It was not until then that the first alarm came to Anthony, for he knew  that the footsteps of the big grey man were dogged by fear. He could no  more conceive it than he could imagine noon and midnight in"]]]
