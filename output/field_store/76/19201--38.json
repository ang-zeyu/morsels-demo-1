Yea, where there is a gang of several persons, only  one of which robs, they are all guilty as to the circumstance of putting  in fear, wherever a person attacks another with circumstances of terror,  as though fear oblige him to part with his money though it be without  weapons drawn, and the person taking it pretend to receive it as an  alms. And in respect of punishment, though judgment of death cannot be  given in any larceny whatsoever, unless the goods taken exceed twelve  pence in value, yet in robbery such judgment is given, let the value of  the goods be ever so small._    _As to crimes committed against the habitations of men, there are two  kinds, viz., burglary and arson._    _Burglary is a felony at Common Law, and consists in breaking and  entering the mansion house of another in the night time with an intent  of committing a felony therein, whether that intention be executed or  not. Here, from the best opinions, is to be understood such a degree of  darkness as hinders a man's countenance from being discerned. The  breaking and entering are points essential to be proved in order to make  any fact burglary; the place in which it is committed must be a dwelling  house, and the breaking and entering such a dwelling house must be an  intent of committing felony, and not a trespass; and this much I think  is sufficient to define the nature of this crime, which notwithstanding  the many examples which have been made of it, is still too much  practised. As to arson, by which the Law understand maliciously and  voluntarily burning the house of another by night or by day; to make a  man guilty of this it must appear that he did it voluntarily and of  malice aforethought._    _Besides these, there are several other felonies which are made so by  Statute, such as rapes committed on women by force, and against their  will. This offence was anciently punished by putting out the eyes and  cutting off the testicles of the offenders; it was afterwards made a  felony, and by a statute in Queen Elizabeth's reign, excluded from  benefit of clergy. By an Act made in the reign of King Henry the  Seventh, taking any woman (whether maid, wife or widow) having any  substance, or being heir apparent to her ancestors, for the lucre of  such substance, and either to marry or defile the said woman against her  will, then such persons and all those procuring or abetting them in the  said violence, shall be guilty of felony, from which, by another Act in  Queen Elizabeth's reign, benefit of clergy is taken. Also by an Act in  the reign of King James the First, any person marrying, their former  husband or wife being then alive, such persons shall be deemed guilty of  felony, but benefit of clergy is yet allowed for this offence._    _As it often happens that boisterous and unruly people, either in frays  or out of revenge, do very great injuries unto others, yet without  taking away their lives, in such a case the Law adjudges the offender  who commits a mayhem to the severest penalties. The true definition of a  mayhem is such a hurt whereby a man is rendered less able in fighting,  so that cutting off or disabling a man's hand, striking out his eye, or  foretooth, were mayhems at Common Law. But by the Statute of King  Charles the Second, if any person or persons, with malice aforethought,  by lying in wait, unlawfully cut out or disable the tongue, put out an  eye, slit the nose, or cut off the nose or lip of any subject of his  Majesty, with an intention of maiming or disfiguring, then the person  so offending, their counsellors, aiders and abetters, privy to the  offence, shall suffer death, as in cases of felony, without benefit of  clergy; which Act is commonly called the Coventry Act, because it was  occasioned by the slitting of the nose of a gentleman of that name, for  a speech made by him in Parliament.[1]_    _As nothing is of greater consequence to the commonwealth than public  credit, so the Legislature hath thought fit, by the highest punishments,  to deter persons from committing such facts for the lucre of gain, as  might injure the credit of the nation. For this purpose, an Act was made  in the reign of the late King William, by which forging or  counterfeiting the common seal of the Governor and Company of the Bank  of England, or of any sealed bank-bill given out in the name of the said  Governor and Company for the payment of any sum of money, or of any  bank-note whatsoever, signed by the said Governor and Company of the  Bank of England, or altering or raising any bank-bill, or note of any  sort, is declared to be felony, without benefit of clergy. Upon this  Statute there have been several convictions, and it is hoped men are  pretty well cured of committing this crime, by that care those in the  direction of the Bank have always taken to bring offenders of this kind  to justice._    _By an Act also passed in the reign of King William, persons who  counterfeit any stamp which by its mark relates to the Revenue, shall be  guilty of felony without benefit of clergy, and upon this also there  have been some executions._    _But as the public companies established in this kingdom have often  occasion to borrow money under their common seal, which bonds, so  sealed, are transferable and pass currently from hand to hand as ready  money, so for the greater security of the subject the counterfeiting the  common seal of the South Sea Company, or altering any bond or obligation  of the said company, is rendered felony without benefit of clergy. Some  other statutes of the same nature in respect to lottery tickets, etc.,  have been made to create felonies of the counterfeiting thereof, but of  these and some other later Statutes, I forbear mentioning here, because  I have spoken particularly of them in the cases where persons have been  punished for transgressing them._    _As I have already exceeded the bounds which I at first intended should  have restrained my Preface, so I forbear lengthening it in speaking of  lesser crimes, few of which concern the persons whose lives are to be  found in the following volume. Therefore I shall conclude here, only  putting my readers once more in mind that by this work the intent of the  Law, in punishing malefactors, is more perfectly fulfilled, since the  example of their deaths is transmitted in a proper light to posterity._    FOOTNOTES:        [1] Sir John Coventry, M. P. for Weymouth, in the course of a          debate on a proposed levy on playhouses, asked \"whether did the          king's pleasure lie among the men or the women that acted?\" This          open allusion to Charles's relations with Nell Gwynn and Moll          Davies enraged the Court party, and on Dec. 21, 1670, as Sir          John was going to his house in Suffolk Street, he was waylaid by          a brutal gang under Sir Thomas Sandys, dragged from his          carriage, and his nose slit to the bone. This outrage caused          great indignation, and the Coventry Act mentioned in the text          was passed, 22 & 23 Car. II. The perpetrators of the deed          escaped.          The Life of JANE GRIFFIN, who was Executed for the Murder of her Maid,  January 29, 1719-20      Passion, when it once gains an ascendant over our minds, is often more  fatal to us than the most deliberate course of vice could be. On every  little start it throws us from the paths of reason, and hurries us in  one moment into acts more wicked and more dangerous than we could at any  other time suffer to enter our imagination. As anger is justly said to  be a short madness, so, while the frenzy is upon us, blood is shed as  easily as water, and the mind is so filled with fury that there is no  room left for compassion. There cannot be a stronger proof of what I  have been observing than in the unhappy end of the poor woman who is the  subject of this chapter.    Jane Griffin was the daughter of honest and substantial parents, who  educated her with very great tenderness and care, particularly with  respect to religion, in which she was well and rationally instructed. As  she grew up her person grew agreeable, and she had a lively wit and a  very tolerable share of understanding. She lived with a very good  reputation, and to general satisfaction, in several places, till she  married Mr. Griffin, who kept the Three Pigeons in Smithfield[2].    She behaved herself so well and was so obliging in her house that she  drew to it a very great trade, in which she managed so as to leave  everyone well satisfied. Yet she allowed her temper to fly out into  sudden gusts of passion, and that folly alone sullied her character to  those who were witnesses of it, and at last caused a shameful end to an  honest and industrious life.    One Elizabeth Osborn, coming to live with her as a servant, she proved  of a disposition as Mrs. Griffin could by no means agree with. They were  continually differing and having high words, in which, as is usual on  such occasions, Mrs. Griffin made use of wild expressions, which though  she might mean nothing by them when she spoke them, yet proved of the  utmost ill consequence, after the fatal accident of the maid's death.  For being then given in evidence, they were esteemed proofs of malice  prepense, which ought to be a warning to all hasty people to endeavour  at some restraint upon their tongues when in fits of anger, since we are  not only sure of answering hereafter for every idle word we speak, but  even here they may, as in this case, become fatal in the last degree.    It was said at the time those things were transacted that jealousy was  in some degree the source of their debates, but of that I can affirm  nothing. It no way appeared as to the accident which immediately drew on  her death, and which happened after this manner.    One evening, having cut some cold fowl for the children's supper, it  happened the key of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#5)"],[1,"enterprise, if such  indeed it be as thou sayst: wherefore lay upon me such behest as thou  shalt deem meet, and thou shalt marvel to witness the vigour of my  performance.\" Whereupon Lysimachus:--\"On the third day from now,\" quoth  he, \"their husbands' houses will be newly entered by the brides, and on  the same day at even we too will enter them in arms, thou with thy men,  and I with some of mine, in whom I place great trust, and forcing our way  among the guests and slaughtering all that dare to oppose us, will bear  the ladies off to a ship which I have had privily got ready.\" Cimon  approved the plan, and kept quiet in prison until the appointed time;  which being come, the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp and  magnificence, that filled the houses of the two brothers with festal  cheer. Then Lysimachus having made ready all things meet, and fired Cimon  and his men and his own friends for the enterprise by a long harangue,  disposed them in due time, all bearing arms under their cloaks, in three  companies; and having privily despatched one company to the port, that,  when the time should come to embark, he might meet with no let, he  marched with the other two companies to the house of Pasimondas, posted  the one company at the gate, that, being entered, they might not be shut  in or debarred their egress, and, with the other company and Cimon,  ascended the stairs, and gained the saloon, where the brides and not a  few other ladies were set at several tables to sup in meet order:  whereupon in they rushed, and overthrew the tables and seized each his  own lady, and placed them in charge of their men, whom they bade bear  them off forthwith to the ship that lay ready to receive them. Whereupon  the brides and the other ladies and the servants with one accord fell a  sobbing and shrieking, insomuch that a confused din and lamentation  filled the whole place. Cimon, Lysimachus and their band, none  withstanding, but all giving way before them, gained the stairs, which  they were already descending when they encountered Pasimondas, who,  carrying a great staff in his hand, was making in the direction of the  noise; but one doughty stroke of Cimon's sword sufficed to cleave his  skull in twain, and lay him dead at Cimon's feet, and another stroke  disposed of hapless Hormisdas, as he came running to his brother's aid.  Some others who ventured to approach them were wounded and beaten off by  the retinue. So forth of the house, that reeked with blood and resounded  with tumult and lamentation and woe, sped Simon and Lysimachus with all  their company, and without any let, in close order, with their fair booty  in their midst, made good their retreat to the ship; whereon with the  ladies they one and all embarked, for the shore was now full of armed men  come to rescue the ladies, and, the oarsmen giving way, put to sea elate.  Arrived at Crete, they met with a hearty welcome on the part of their  many friends and kinsfolk; and, having married their ladies, they made  greatly merry, and had gladsome joyance of their fair booty. Their doings  occasioned, both in Cyprus and in Rhodes, no small stir and commotion,  which lasted for a long while: but in the end, by the good offices of  their friends and kinsfolk in both islands, 'twas so ordered as that  after a certain term of exile Cimon returned with Iphigenia to Cyprus,  and in like manner Lysimachus returned with Cassandra to Rhodes; and long  and blithely thereafter lived they, each well contented with his own wife  in his own land.

NOVEL II.    --  Gostanza loves Martuccio Gomito, and hearing that he is dead, gives way  to despair, and hies her alone aboard a boat, which is wafted by the wind  to Susa. She finds him alive in Tunis, and makes herself known to him,  who, having by his counsel gained high place in the king's favour,  marries her, and returns with her wealthy to Lipari.  --    Pamfilo's story being ended, the queen, after commending it not a little,  called for one to follow from Emilia; who thus began:--    Meet and right it is that one should rejoice when events so fall out that  passion meets with its due reward: and as love merits in the long run  rather joy than suffering, far gladlier obey I the queen's than I did the  king's behest, and address myself to our present theme. You are to know  then, dainty ladies, that not far from Sicily there is an islet called  Lipari, in which, no great while ago, there dwelt a damsel, Gostanza by  name, fair as fair could be, and of one of the most honourable families  in the island. And one Martuccio Gomito, who was also of the island, a  young man most gallant and courteous, and worthy for his condition,  became enamoured of Gostanza; who in like manner grew so afire for him  that she was ever ill at ease, except she saw him. Martuccio, craving her  to wife, asked her of her father, who made answer that, Martuccio being  poor, he was not minded to give her to him. Mortified to be thus rejected  by reason of poverty, Martuccio took an oath in presence of some of his  friends and kinsfolk that Lipari should know him no more, until he was  wealthy. So away he sailed, and took to scouring the seas as a rover on  the coast of Barbary, preying upon all whose force matched not his own.  In which way of life he found Fortune favourable enough, had he but known  how to rest and be thankful: but 'twas not enough that he and his  comrades in no long time waxed very wealthy; their covetousness was  inordinate, and, while they sought to gratify it, they chanced in an  encounter with certain Saracen ships to be taken after a long defence,  and despoiled, and, most part of them, thrown into the sea by their  captors, who, after sinking his ship, took Martuccio with them to Tunis,  and clapped him in prison, and there kept him a long time in a very sad  plight.    Meanwhile, not by one or two, but by divers and not a few persons,  tidings reached Lipari that all that were with Martuccio aboard his bark  had perished in the sea. The damsel, whose grief on Martuccio's departure  had known no bounds, now hearing that he was dead with the rest, wept a  great while, and made up her mind to have done with life; but, lacking  the resolution to lay violent hands upon herself, she bethought her how  she might devote herself to death by some novel expedient. So one night  she stole out of her father's house, and hied her to the port, and there  by chance she found, lying a little apart from the other craft, a fishing  boat, which, as the owners had but just quitted her, was still equipped  with mast and sails and oars. Aboard which boat she forthwith got, and  being, like most of the women of the island, not altogether without  nautical skill, she rowed some distance out to sea, and then hoisted  sail, and cast away oars and tiller, and let the boat drift, deeming that  a boat without lading or steersman would certainly be either capsized by  the wind or dashed against some rock and broken in pieces, so that escape  she could not, even if she would, but must perforce drown. And so, her  head wrapped in a mantle, she stretched herself weeping on the floor of  the boat. But it fell out quite otherwise than she had conjectured: for,  the wind being from the north, and very equable, with next to no sea, the  boat kept an even keel, and next day about vespers bore her to land hard  by a city called Susa, full a hundred miles beyond Tunis. To the damsel  'twas all one whether she were at sea or ashore, for, since she had been  aboard, she had never once raised, nor, come what might, meant she ever  to raise, her head.    Now it so chanced, that, when the boat grounded, there was on the shore a  poor woman that was in the employ of some fishermen, whose nets she was  just taking out of the sunlight. Seeing the boat under full sail, she  marvelled how it should be suffered to drive ashore, and conjectured that  the fishermen on board were asleep. So to the boat she hied her, and  finding therein only the damsel fast asleep, she called her many times,  and at length awakened her; and perceiving by her dress that she was a  Christian, she asked her in Latin how it was that she was come thither  all alone in the boat. Hearing the Latin speech, the damsel wondered  whether the wind had not shifted, and carried her back to Lipari: so up  she started, gazed about her, and finding herself ashore and the aspect  of the country strange, asked the good woman where she was. To which the  good woman made answer:--\"My daughter, thou art hard by Susa in Barbary.\"  Whereupon the damsel, sorrowful that God had not seen fit to accord her  the boon of death, apprehensive of dishonour, and at her wits' end, sat  herself down at the foot of her boat, and burst into tears. Which the  good woman saw not without pity, and persuaded her to come with her into  her hut, and there by coaxing drew from her how she was come thither; and  knowing that she could not but be fasting, she set before her her own  coarse bread and some fish and water, and prevailed upon her to eat a  little. Gostanza thereupon asked her, who she was that thus spoke Latin;  whereto she answered that her name was Carapresa, and that she was from  Trapani, where she had served some Christian fishermen. To the damsel,  sad indeed though she was, this name Carapresa, wherefore she knew not,  seemed to be of happy augury, so that she began to take hope, she knew  not why, and to grow somewhat less fain of death: wherefore without  disclosing who or whence she was, she earnestly besought the good woman  for the love of God to have pity on her youth, and advise her how best to  avoid insult. Whereupon Carapresa, good woman that she was, left her in  her hut, while with all speed she picked up her nets; and on her return  she wrapped her in her own mantle, and led her to Susa. Arrived there,  she said to her:--\"Gostanza, I shall"]]]
