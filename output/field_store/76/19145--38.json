The wind whirred, like a night-bird, louder through the trees, and  gave tones to the acacia-grove; and the tones called to the pair who  had first become happy within it: \"Enter, new mortal pair, and think  of what is past, and of my withering and your own; be holy as Eternity,  and weep not only for joy, but for gratitude also!\" And the wet-eyed  bridegroom led his wet-eyed bride under the blossoms, and laid his  soul, like a flower, on her heart, and said: \"Best Thiennette, I am  unspeakably happy, and would say much, but cannot! Ah, thou Dearest,  we will live like angels, like children together! Surely I will do  all that is good to thee; two years ago I had nothing, no, nothing;  ah, it is through thee, best love, that I am happy. I call thee Thou,  now, thou dear good soul!\" She drew him closer to her, and said, though  without kissing him: \"Call me Thou always, Dearest!\"    And as they stept forth again from the sacred grove into the  magic-dusky garden, he took off his hat; first, that he might  internally thank God, and, secondly, because he wished to look into  this fairest evening sky.    They reached the blazing, rustling, marriage-house, but their  softened hearts sought stillness; and a foreign touch, as in the  blossoming vine, would have disturbed the flower-nuptials of their  souls. They turned rather, and winded up into the churchyard to  preserve their mood. Majestic on the groves and mountains stood the  Night before man's heart, and made that also great. Over the _white_  steeple-obelisk the sky rested _bluer_, and _darker_; and, behind it,  wavered the withered summit of the May-pole with faded flag. The son  noticed his father's grave, on which the wind was opening and  shutting, with harsh noise, the little door of the metal cross, to let  the year of his death be read on the brass plate within. As an  overpowering sadness seized his heart with violent streams of tears,  and drove him to the sunk hillock, he led his bride to the grave, and  said: \"Here sleeps he, my good father; in his thirty-second year he  was carried hither to his long rest. O thou good, dear father, couldst  thou today but see the happiness of thy son, like my mother! But thy  eyes are empty, and thy breast is full of ashes, and thou seest us  not.\" He was silent. The bride wept aloud; she saw the moldering  coffins of her parents open, and the two dead arise and look round for  their daughter, who had stayed so long behind them, forsaken on the  earth. She fell upon his heart, and faltered: \"O beloved, I have  neither father nor mother. Do not forsake me!\"    O thou who hast still a father and a mother, thank God for it, on the  day when thy soul is full of joyful tears and needs a bosom whereon to  shed them.    And with this embracing at a father's grave, let this day of joy be  holily concluded.          ROME[2]    From _Titan_ (1800)    By JEAN PAUL    TRANSLATED BY C. T. BROOKS    Half an hour after the earthquake the heavens swathed themselves in  seas, and dashed them down in masses and in torrents. The naked  _Campagna_ and heath were covered with the mantle of rain. Gaspard was  silent, the heavens black; the great thought stood alone in Albano  that he was hastening on toward the bloody scaffold and the  throne-scaffolding of humanity, the heart of a cold, dead  heathen-world, the eternal Rome; and when he heard, on the _Ponte  Molle_, that he was now going across the Tiber, then was it to him as  if the past had risen from the dead, as if the stream of time ran  backward and bore him with it; under the streams of heaven he heard  the seven old mountain-streams, rushing and roaring, which once came  down from Rome's hills, and, with seven arms, uphove the world from  its foundations. At length the constellation of the mountain city of  God, that stood so broad before him, opened out into distant nights;  cities, with scattered lights, lay up and down, and the bells (which  to his ear were alarm-bells) sounded out the fourth hour; [3] when the  carriage rolled through the triumphal gate of the city, the _Porta del  Popolo_, then the moon rent her black heavens, and poured down out of  the cleft clouds the splendor of a whole sky. There stood the Egyptian  Obelisk of the gateway, high as the clouds, in the night, and three  streets ran gleaming apart. \"So,\" (said Albano to himself, as they  passed through the long _Corso_ to the tenth ward) \"thou art veritably  in the camp of the God of war--here is where he grasped the hilt of  the monstrous war-sword, and with the point made the three wounds in  three quarters of the world!\" Rain and splendor gushed through the  vast, broad streets; occasionally he passed suddenly along by gardens,  and into broad city-deserts and market-places of the past. The rolling  of the carriages amidst the rush and roar of the rain resembled the  thunder whose days were once holy to this heroic city, like the  thundering heaven to the thundering earth; muffled-up forms, with  little lights, stole through the dark streets; often there stood a  long palace with colonnades in the light of the moon, often a solitary  gray column, often a single high fir tree, or a statue behind  cypresses. Once, when there was neither rain nor moonshine, the  carriage went round the corner of a large house, on whose roof a tall,  blooming virgin, with an uplooking child on her arm, herself directed  a little hand-light, now toward a white statue, now toward the child,  and so, alternately, illuminated each. This friendly group made its  way to the very centre of his soul, now so highly exalted, and brought  with it, to him, many a recollection; particularly was a Roman child  to him a wholly new and mighty idea.    They alighted at last at the Prince _di Lauria's_--Gaspard's  father-in-law and old friend. * * * Albano, dissatisfied with all, kept  his inspiration sacrificing to the unearthly gods of the past round  about him, after the old fashion, namely, with silence. Well might he  and could he have discussed, but otherwise, namely in odes, with the  whole man, with streams which mount and grow upward. He looked even more  and more longingly out of the window at the moon in the pure rain-blue,  and at single columns of the Forum; out of doors there gleamed for him  the greatest world. At last he rose up, indignant and impatient, and  stole down into the glimmering glory, and stepped before the Forum; but  the moonlit night, that decoration-painter, which works with irregular  strokes, made almost the very stage of the scene irrecognizable to him.    What a dreary, broad plain, loftily encompassed with ruins, gardens  and temples, covered with prostrate capitals of columns, and with  single, upright pillars, and with trees and a dumb wilderness! The  heaped-up ashes out of the emptied urn of Time! And the potsherds of a  great world flung around! He passed by three temple columns,[4] which  the earth had drawn down into itself even to the breast, and along  through the broad triumphal arch of Septimius Severus; on the right,  stood a chain of columns without their temple; on the left, attached  to a Christian church, the colonnade of an ancient heathen temple,  deep sunken into the sediment of time; at last the triumphal arch of  Titus, and before it, in the middle of the woody wilderness, a  fountain gushing into a granite basin.    He went up to this fountain, in order to survey the plain out of which  the thunder months of the earth once arose; but he went along as over  a burnt-out sun, hung round with dark, dead earths. \"O Man, O the  dreams of Man!\" something within him unceasingly cried. He stood on  the granite margin, turning toward the Coliseum, whose mountain ridges  of wall stood high in the moonlight, with the deep gaps which had been  hewn in them by the scythe of Time. Sharply stood the rent and ragged  arches of Nero's golden house close by, like murderous cutlasses. The  Palatine Hill lay full of green gardens, and, in crumbling  temple-roofs, the blooming death-garland of ivy was gnawing, and  living ranunculi still glowed around sunken capitals. The fountain  murmured babblingly and forever, and the stars gazed steadfastly down,  with transitory rays, upon the still battlefield over which the winter  of time had passed without bringing after it a spring; the fiery soul  of the world had flown up, and the cold, crumbling giant lay around;  torn asunder were the gigantic spokes of the main-wheel, which once  the very stream of ages drove. And in addition to all this, the moon  shed down her light like eating silver-water upon the naked columns,  and would fain have dissolved the Coliseum and the temples and all  into their own shadows!    Then Albano stretched out his arm into the air, as if he were giving  an embrace and flowing away as in the arms of a stream, and exclaimed,  \"O ye mighty shades, ye, who once strove and lived here, ye are  looking down from Heaven, but scornfully, not sadly, for your great  fatherland has died and gone after you! Ah, had I, on the  insignificant earth, full of old eternity which you have made great,  only done one action worthy of you! Then were it sweet to me and  legitimate to open my heart by a wound, and to mix earthly blood with  the hallowed soil, and, out of the world of graves, to hasten away to  you, eternal and immortal ones! But I am not worthy of it!\"    At this moment there came suddenly along up the _Via Sacra_ a tall  man, deeply enveloped in a mantle, who drew near the fountain without  looking round, threw down his hat, and held a coal-black, curly,  almost perpendicular, hindhead under the stream of water. But hardly  had he, turning upward, caught a glimpse of the profile of Albano,  absorbed in his fancies, when he started up, all dripping, stared at  the count, fell into an amazement, threw his arms high into the air,  and said, \"_Amico_!\" Albano looked at him. The stranger said,  \"Albano!\" \"My Dian!\" cried Albano;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12063"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 14, No. 388, (#5)"],[1," to infer that the fear of death is not  common, and that where it exists it proceeds rather from a diseased and  enfeebled mind, than from any principle in our nature. Certain it is, that  among the poor the approach of dissolution is usually regarded with a quiet  and natural composure, which it is consolatory to contemplate, and which is  as far removed from the dead palsy of unbelief as it is from the delirious  raptures of fanaticism. Theirs is a true, unhesitating faith; and they are  willing to lay down the burden of a weary life, in the sure and certain  hope of a blessed immortality. Who, indeed, is there, that would not gladly  make the exchange, if he lived only for himself, and were to leave none who  stood in need of him--no eyes to weep at his departure, no hearts to ache  for his loss? The day of death, says the preacher, is better than the day  of one's birth; a sentence to which whoever has lived long, and may humbly  hope that he has not lived ill, must heartily assent.           *       *       *       *       *      MASANIELLO.      The last No. (8,) of the _Foreign Quarley Review_, just published, contains  an attractive article on the Revolutions of Naples, in 1647 and 1648, in  which Masaniello played so conspicuous a part. The paper is in the easy  historical style of Sir Walter Scott; but as little could be selected for  our pages, except the Adventures of the Rebel Fisherman, and as we have  given the leading events of his life in an early volume of the MIRROR, we  content ourselves with the following passage. After a tolerably fair  estimate of the character of Masaniello, in which Sir Walter considers his  extraordinary rise as a work of fortune and contingency rather than of his  own device in the conception, or his own exertions in the execution--the  writer says--    \"It would be doing Masaniello injustice, however, if we did not add, that  having no distinct prospect of rendering essential service to his country,  he was at the same time totally free from any sinister views of personal  aggrandizement. He appears to have been sincere in his wishes, that when he  had set Naples free,--by which he understood the abolition of imposts,--the  government of it should be committed to a popular management. The Memoirs  of 1828 record a singular circumstance with regard to this point, on the  authority of De Santis. While, on Friday, July 12th, the sixth day of the  insurrection, he was sitting in his judgment-seat, a female masked, or man  in woman's habit, approached and whispered, 'Masaniello, we have reached  the goal, a crown is prepared, and it is for thy brows.'--'For mine?' he  replied, 'I desire none but the green wreath with which we honour Our  Lady's festival in September. When I have delivered my country I shall  resume my nets.'--'You find them no more. Rebellion should not be  undertaken, or it should be carried on to the end.'--'I will resume my  nets,' said Masaniello steadily. 'You will not find them,' said the  intrusive monitor. 'What, then, shall I find?'--'Death!' answered the  masked figure, and withdrew into the crowd. An evidence of the purity of  his intentions, though combined with gross ignorance, was afforded by the  rigour with which he insisted on the destruction of the treasure and rich  movables found in the houses which were destroyed during the first days of  the tumult. Latterly, indeed, he yielded to the suggestions of Genuino and  d'Arpaya, that these things should be preserved for the good of the state,  and for the purpose of presenting them as a donative to Philip IV. in  place of the abolished gabelles. But whatever was the case with regard to  less scrupulous insurgents, he participated in no plunder, until vanity  produced madness, or madness vanity. On the whole we may conclude, that he  was a man whose principal characteristic was the boldness with which he  pursued an object ardently desired, but who was alike incapable, from want  of knowledge and talents, to avail himself of the success which so  wonderfully crowned his enterprise. How far his cruelty was the effect of  natural disposition, or a consequence of his malady, is a question that  must be left to HIM to whom alone it can be known.\"           *       *       *       *       *      LONDON.    _Literally translated from a Chinese Poem, by a Chinese who visited England  in 1813._        The towering edifices rise story above story,    In all the stateliness of splendid mansions:    Railings of iron thickly stud the sides of every entrance;    And streams from the river circulate through the walls;    The sides of each apartment are variegated with devices;    Through the windows of glass appear the scarlet hangings.    And in the street itself is presented a beautiful scene;    The congregated buildings have all the aspect of a picture.      In London, about the period of the ninth moon,    The inhabitants delight in travelling to a distance;    They change their abodes and betake themselves to the country,    Visiting their friends in their rural retreats.    The prolonged sound of carriages and steeds is heard through the day;    Then in autumn the prices of provisions fall,    And the greater number of dwellings being untenanted,    Such as require it are repaired and adorned.      The spacious streets are exceedingly smooth and level,    Each being crossed by others at intervals;    On either side perambulate men and females,    In the centre, career along the carriages and horses;    The mingled sound of voices is heard in the shops at evening.    During midwinter the accumulated snows adhere to the pathway,    Lamps are displayed at night along the street sides,    Their radiance twinkling like the stars of the sky.           *       *       *       *       *      Mozart was _rather vain_ of the proportion of his hands and feet--but not  of having written the Requiem or the Don Juan.           *       *       *       *       *      BURMESE DIGNITY.      Mr. Crawfurd, in his account of the _Embassy to Ava_, relates the following  specimen of the dignity of a Burmese minister. While sitting under an  awning on the poop of the steam vessel, a heavy squall, with rain, came  on.--\"I suggested to his excellency the convenience of going below, which  he long resisted, under the apprehension of committing his dignity by  placing himself in a situation where persons might tread over his head, for  this singular antipathy is common both to the Burmese and Siamese. The  prejudice is more especially directed against the fair sex; a pretty  conclusive proof of the estimation in which they are held. His excellency  seriously demanded to know whether any woman had ever trod upon the poop;  and being assured in the negative, he consented at length to enter the  cabin.\"           *       *       *       *       *      STEAM.      A quotation from Agathias clearly establishes a knowledge of the  applicability of steam to mechanical purposes so early as the reign of the  emperor Justinian, when the philosopher Anthemius most unphilosophically  employed its powerful agency at Constantinople to shake the house of a  litigious neighbour. It is also recorded, that Pope Sylvester II.  constructed an organ, that was worked by steam. As compared with recent  ingenuity, however, these applications may fairly bring to mind the  Frenchman's boast of his countryman's invention of the frill and the  ruffle; while his English opponent claimed for his native land the honour  of suggesting the addition of the shirt.           *       *       *       *       *      MEDICAL MUSIC.      Sharp, the surgeon, Sir Charles Blicke's master, was a great amateur of  music, but he never used it as a means of curing patients, only in  attracting them. It was said that he \"fiddled himself into practice, and  fiddled Mr. Pott out of it;\" certain it is Mr. Pott, not being a _flat_,  did not choose to act in _concert_ with _Sharp_, and made a quick movement  to the westward.           *       *       *       *       *      Boerhaave tells us, that one of the greatest orators of antiquity, Tiberius  Gracchus, when animated, used to cry out like an old woman; to avoid which,  he had a servant, who, at these periods, sounded a pipe, by way of hint, as  well as to pitch the tone, so sensible was he of the importance of a  well-regulated voice.           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS           *       *       *       *       *      LINES ON THE DEPARTURE OF EMIGRANTS FOR NEW SOUTH WALES.    BY T. CAMPBELL.        On England's shore I saw a pensive hand,    With sails unfurl'd for earth's remotest strand,    Like children parting from a mother, shed    Tears for the home that could not yield them bread;    Grief mark'd each face receding from the view,    'Twas grief to nature honourably true.    And long, poor wand'rers o'er th' ecliptic deep,    The song that names but home shall bid you weep;    Oft shall ye fold your flocks by stars above    In that far world, and miss the stars ye love;    Oft, when its tuneless birds scream round forlorn,    Regret the lark that gladdens England's morn.    And, giving England's names to distant scenes,    Lament that earth's extension intervenes.      But cloud not yet too long, industrious train,    Your solid good with sorrow nursed in vain:    For has the heart no interest yet as bland    As that which binds us to our native land?    The deep-drawn wish, when children crown our hearth,    To hear the cherub-chorus of their mirth.    Undamp'd by dread that want may e'er unhouse,    Or servile misery knit those smiling brows:    The pride to rear an independent shed,    And give the lips we love unborrow'd bread;    To see a world, from shadowy forests won,    In youthful beauty wedded to the sun;    To skirt our home with harvests widely sown,    And call the blooming landscape all our own,    Our children's heritage, in prospect long.
