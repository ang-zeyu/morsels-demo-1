[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9799"],[0,"It Happened in Egypt (#4)"],[1," is, Monny's aunt is a  handsome creature, distinctly a charmer who may at most have reached  the age when Cleopatra--Antony's and Caesar's Cleopatra--died in the  prime of her beauty. If Mrs. East chooses to date herself at thirty-three,  any man not a confirmed misanthrope must believe her. Biddy says  that until Peter Gilder was safely dead, Clara East was just an  ordinary, well-dressed, pleasure-loving, novel-reading,  chocolate-eating, respectable widow of a New York stockbroker:  superstitious perhaps; fond of consulting palmists, and possessing  Billikens or other mascots: (how many women are free from  superstition?) slightly oriental in her love of sumptuous colours  and jewellery; but then her mother (Peter Gilder's step-mother)  was a beautiful Jewish opera singer. After Peter's death, his  half-sister gave up novels for Egyptian and Roman history,  took to studying hieroglyphics, and learning translations of  Greek poetry. She invited a clairvoyant and crystal-gazer, claiming  Egyptian origin, to visit at her Madison Square flat. Sayda Sabri,  banished from Bond Street years ago, took up her residence in New York,  accompanied by her tame mummy. Of course, it is the mummy of a  princess, and she keeps it illuminated with blue lights, in an inner  sanctum, where the bored-looking thing stands upright in its  brilliantly painted mummy case, facing the door. About the time of  Sayda's visit, it was noticed by Mrs. East's friends (this, according  to Biddy) that the colour of the lady's hair was slowly but surely  changing from black to chestnut, then to auburn; she was heard to  remark casually that Queen Cleopatra's hair had been red. She took to  rich Eastern scents, to whitening her face as Eastern women of rank  have whitened theirs since time immemorial. The shadows round her  almond-shaped eyes were intensified: her full lips turned from  healthful pink to carmine. The ends of her tapering fingers blushed  rosily as sticks of coral. The style of her dress changed, at the  moment of going into purple as \"second mourning\" for Peter, and became  oriental, even to the turban-like shape of her hats, and the design of  her jewellery. She did away with crests and monograms on handkerchiefs,  stationery, luggage and so on, substituting a curious little oval  containing strange devices, which Monny discovered to be the  \"cartouche\" of Cleopatra. Then the whole truth burst forth. Sayda  Sabri's crystal had shown that Clara East, nee Gilder, was the  reincarnation of Cleopatra the Great of Egypt. There had been another  incarnation in between, but it was of no account, and, like a poor  relation who has disgraced a family, the less said about it the better.    The lady did not proclaim her identity from the housetops. Rare souls  possessing knowledge of Egyptian lore might draw their own conclusions  from the cartouche on her note-paper and other things. Only Monny and a  few intimates were told the truth at first; but afterward it leaked  out, as secrets do; and Mrs. East seemed shyly pleased if discreet  questions were asked concerning her amulets and the cartouche.    Now, I never feel inclined to laugh at a pretty woman. It is more  agreeable, as well as gallant, to laugh with her; but the trouble is,  Cleopatra doesn't go in for laughter. She takes life seriously. Not  only has she no sense of humour, but she does not know the difference  between it and a sense of fun, which she can understand if a joke  (about somebody else) is explained. She is grateful to me because I  look her straight in the eyes when the subject of Egypt is mentioned.  Sheridan from Harvard has been in her bad books since he put Ptolemaic  rulers outside of the pale of Egyptian history, called their art ornate  and bad, mentioned that each of their queens was named Cleopatra and  classified the lot as modern, almost suburban.    Mrs. East, leaning beside me on the rail, was burning with thoughts  inspired by Alexandria. She had \"Plutarch's Lives\" under her arm, and  \"Hypatia\" in her hand. Of course, she dropped them both, one after the  other, and I picked them up.    \"Do you know, Lord Ernest,\" she said, in the low, rich voice she is  cultivating, \"I don't mind telling you that I felt as if I were coming  home, after a long absence. Monny wanted to see Egypt; I was dying to.  That's the difference between us.\"    \"It's natural,\" I answered, sympathetically.    \"Yes--considering everything. Yet we're both afraid. She in one way, I  in another. I haven't told her. She hasn't told me. But I know. She has  the same impression I have, that something's going to _happen_  --something very great, to change the whole of life--in Egypt: 'Khem,' it  seems to me I can remember calling it. You know it was Khem, until the  Arabs came and named it Misr. Do you believe in impressions like that?\"    \"I don't disbelieve,\" I said. \"Some people are more sensitive than  others.\"    \"Yes. Or else they're older souls. But it may be the same thing. I  can't fancy Monny an old soul, can you?--yet she may be, for she's very  intelligent, although so self-willed. I think what she's afraid of is  getting interested in some wonderful man with Turkish or Egyptian  blood, a magnificent creature like you read of in books, you know; then  you have to give them up in the last chapter, and send them away  broken-hearted. I suppose there _are_ such men in real life?\"    \"I doubt if there are such romantic figures as the books make out,\" I  tried to reassure her. \"There might be a prince or two, handsome and  cultivated, educated in England, perhaps, for some of the 'swells' are  sent from Egypt to Oxford and Cambridge, just as they are in India. But  even if Miss Gilder should meet a man of that sort, I should say she  was too sensible and clear-headed--\"    \"Oh, she is, almost too much so for a young girl, and she has a  detestation for any one with a drop of dark blood, in America. She  doesn't even like Jews; and that makes friction between us, if we ever  happen to argue, for--maybe you don't know?--my mother was a Jewess.  I'm proud of her memory. But that's just _why_, if you can understand,  Monny's _afraid_ in Egypt. Some girls would like to have a tiny  flirtation with a gorgeous Eastern creature (of course, he must be a  bey, or prince or something, otherwise it would be _infra dig_), but  Monny would hate herself for being attracted. Yet I know she dreads it  happening, because of the way I've heard her rave against the heroines  of novels, saying she has no patience with them; they ought to have  more strength of mind, even if it broke their hearts.\"    I wondered if Biddy, too, suspected some such fear in the mind of her  adored girl, and if that were one reason why she had turned matchmaker  for my benefit. Since the first day out she had used strategems to  throw us together: and it seemed that, years ago, when she used to  teach the little girl French, Monny's favourite stories had been of  Castle Killeena, and my boyish exploits birds'-nesting on the crags.  (Biddy said that this was a splendid beginning, if I had the sense to  follow it up.)    \"And you?\" I went on to Mrs. East. \"What do you feel is going to happen  to you in the land of Khem?\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" she sighed. \"I wish I did! And 'afraid' isn't  exactly the word. I just know that something will happen. I wonder if  history does repeat itself? I should hate to be bitten by an asp----\"    \"Asps are out of fashion,\" I comforted her. \"I doubt if you could find  one in all of Egypt, though I remember my Egyptian nurse used to say  there were cobras in the desert in summer. Anyhow, we'll be away before  summer.\"    \"I suppose so,\" she agreed. \"Yet--who knows what will become of any of  us? Madame Rechid Bey will be staying, of course. I don't know whether  to be sorry for her or not. The Bey's good-looking. He has brown eyes,  and is as white as you or I. Probably it's true that she's been too  seasick to leave her room for the last ten days, though Monny and Mrs.  O'Bri--I mean, Mrs. Jones--think she's shut up because men stared, and  because Mr. Sheridan talked to her. As for me, there's always that  question asking itself in my mind: _'What_ is going to happen?' And I  hear it twice as loud as before, in sight of Alexandria. Rakoti, we  Lagidae used to call the city.\" As she spoke, the long, oriental eyes  glanced at me sidewise, but my trustworthy Celtic features showed a  grave, intelligent interest in her statements.    \"It must be,\" she went on, encouraged, \"that I'm the reincarnation of  Cleopatra, otherwise how _could_ I have the sensation of remembering  everything? There's no other way to account for it! And you know my  modern name, Clara, does begin with 'C.' Sayda must be right. She's  told lots of women the most extraordinary things. You really ought to  consult her, Lord Ernest, if you ever go to New York.\"    I did not say, as Neill Sheridan might, that a frothy course of  Egyptian historical novels would account for anything. I simply looked  as diplomatic training can teach any one to look.    Evidently it was the right look in the right place, for Cleopatra  continued more courageously, recalling the great Pharos of white marble  which used to be one of the world's wonders in her day; the Museum, and  the marvellous Library which took fire while Julius Caesar burned the  fleet, nearby in the harbour.    \"Think of the philosophers who deserted the College of Heliopolis for  Alexandria!\" she said. \"Antony was more of a soldier than a student,  but even he grieved for the Library. You know he tried to console  Cleopatra by making her a present of two hundred thousand MSS. from the  library of the King of Pergamus. It was a generous thought--like  Antony!\"    \"Does the harbour looked changed?\" I hastened to inquire.    \"Not from a distance, though landing may be a shock: they tell me it's  all so Italian now. It was Greek in old days. I've read that there  isn't a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#4)"],[1,"by that old ruffian, and I'm not going to let you  sit up all night either. Where are you staying, my man?\"    \"Nowhere yet. I left my kit at the club. I was going out home if I'd  caught you early enough.\"    \"Stout fellow! You stay here.\"    \"My dear old man, I couldn't think of it,\" said Teddy gratefully.    \"My dear young man, I don't care whether you think of it or not. Here you  stay, and moreover you turn in at once. I can fix you up with all you  want, and Barraclough shall bring your kit round before you're awake.\"    \"But you haven't got a bed, Raffles?\"    \"You shall have mine. I hardly ever go to bed--do I, Bunny?\"    \"I've seldom seen you there,\" said I.    \"But you were travelling all last night?\"    \"And straight through till this evening, and I sleep all the time in a  train,\" said Raffles. \"I hardly opened an eye all day; if I turned in  to-night I shouldn't get a wink.\"    \"Well, I shan't either,\" said the other hopelessly. \"I've forgotten how  to sleep!\"    \"Wait till I learn you!\" said Raffles, and went into the inner room and  lit it up.    \"I'm terribly sorry about it all,\" whispered young Garland, turning to me  as though we were old friends now.    \"And I'm sorry for you,\" said I from my heart. \"I know what it is.\"    Garland was still staring when Raffles returned with a tiny bottle from  which he was shaking little round black things into his left palm.    \"Clean sheets yawning for you, Teddy,\" said he. \"And now take two of  these, and one more spot of whisky, and you'll be asleep in ten minutes.\"    \"What are they?\"    \"Somnol. The latest thing out, and quite the best.\"    \"But won't they give me a frightful head?\"    \"Not a bit of it; you'll be as right as rain ten minutes after you wake  up. And you needn't leave this before eleven to-morrow morning, because  you don't want a knock at the nets, do you?\"    \"I ought to have one,\" said Teddy seriously. But Raffles laughed  him to scorn.    \"They're not playing you for runs, my man, and I shouldn't run any risks  with those hands. Remember all the chances they're going to lap up  to-morrow, and all the byes they've not got to let!\"    And Raffles had administered his opiate before the patient knew much more  about it; next minute he was shaking hands with me, and the minute after  that Raffles went in to put out his light. He was gone some little time;  and I remember leaning out of the window in order not to overhear the  conversation in the next room. The night was nearly as fine as ever. The  starry ceiling over the Albany Courtyard was only less beautifully blue  than when Raffles and I had come in a couple of hours ago. The traffic in  Piccadilly came as crisply to the ear as on a winter's night of hard  frost. It was a night of wine, and sparkling wine, and the day at Lord's  must surely be a day of nectar. I could not help wondering whether any  man had ever played in the University match with such a load upon his  soul as E.M. Garland was taking to his forced slumbers; and then whether  any heavy-laden soul had ever hit upon two such brother confessors as  Raffles and myself!          CHAPTER III    Council of War      Raffles was humming a snatch of something too choice for me to recognise  when I drew in my head from the glorious night. The folding-doors were  shut, and the grandfather's clock on one side of them made it almost  midnight. Raffles would not stop his tune for me, but he pointed to the  syphon and decanter, and I replenished my glass. He had a glass beside  him also, which was less usual, but he did not sit down beside his glass;  he was far too fidgety for that; even bothering about a pair of pictures  which had changed places under some zealous hand in his absence, or  rather two of Mr. Hollyer's fine renderings of Watts and Burne-Jones of  which I had never seen Raffles take the slightest notice before. But it  seemed that they must hang where he had hung them, and for once I saw  them hanging straight. The books had also suffered from good intentions;  he gave them up with a shrug. Archives and arcana he tested or examined,  and so a good many minutes passed without a word. But when he stole back  into the inner room, after waiting a little at the folding-doors, there  was still some faint strain upon his lips; it was only when he returned,  shutting the door none too quietly behind him, that he stopped humming  and spoke out with a grimmer face than he had worn all night.    \"That boy's in a bigger hole than he thinks. But we must pull him out  between us before play begins. It's one clear call for us, Bunny!\"    \"Is it a bigger hole than you thought?\" I asked, thinking myself of the  conversation which I had managed not to overhear.    \"I don't say that, Bunny, though I never should have dreamt of his old  father being in one too. I own I can't understand that. They live in a  regular country house in the middle of Kensington, and there are only the  two of them. But I've given Teddy my word not to go to the old man for  the money, so it's no use talking about it.\"    But apparently it was what they had been talking about behind the  folding-doors; it only surprised me to see how much Raffles took  it to heart.    \"So you have made up your mind to raise the money elsewhere?\"    \"Before that lad in there opens his eyes.\"    \"Is he asleep already?\"    \"Like the dead,\" said Raffles, dropping into his chair and drinking  thoughtfully; \"and so he will be till we wake him up. It's a ticklish  experiment, Bunny, but even a splitting head for the first hour's play is  better than a sleepless night; I've tried both, so I ought to know. I  shouldn't even wonder if he did himself more than justice to-morrow; one  often does when just less than fit; it takes off that dangerous edge of  over-keenness which so often cuts one's own throat.\"    \"But what do you think of it all, A.J.?\"    \"Not so much worse than I let him think I thought.\"    \"But you must have been amazed?\"    \"I am past amazement at the worst thing the best of us ever does, and  contrariwise of course. Your rich man proves a pauper, and your honest  man plays the knave; we're all of us capable of every damned thing. But  let us thank our stars and Teddy's that we got back just when we did.\"    \"Why at that moment?\"    Raffles produced the unfinished cheque, shook his head over it, and sent  it fluttering across to me.    \"Was there ever such a childish attempt? They'd have kept him in the bank  while they sent for the police. If ever you want to play this game,  Bunny, you must let me coach you up a bit.\"    \"But it was never one of your games, A.J.!\"    \"Only incidentally once or twice; it never appealed to me,\" said Raffles,  sending expanding circlets of smoke to crown the girls on the Golden  Stair that was no longer tilted in a leaning tower. \"No, Bunny, an  occasional _exeat_ at school is my modest record as a forger, though I  admit that augured ill. Do you remember how I left my cheque-book about  on purpose for what's happened? To be sinned against instead of sinning,  in all the papers, would have set one up as an honest man for life. I  thought, God forgive me, of poor old Barraclough or somebody of that  kind. And to think it should be 'the friend in whom my soul confided'!  Not that I ever did confide in him, Bunny, much as I love this lad.\"    Despite the tense of that last statement, it was the old Raffles who was  speaking now, the incisively cynical old Raffles that I still knew the  best, the Raffles of the impudent quotations and jaunty _jeux d'esprit_.  This Raffles only meant half he said--but had generally done the other  half! I met his mood by reminding him (out of his own _Whitaker_) that  the sun rose at 3.51, in case he thought of breaking in anywhere that  night. I had the honour of making Raffles smile.    \"I did think of it, Bunny,\" said he. \"But there's only one crib that we  could crack in decency for this money; and our Mr. Shylock's is not the  sort of city that Caesar himself would have taken _ex itinere_. It's a  case for the _testudo_ and all the rest of it. You must remember that  I've been there, Bunny; at least I've visited his 'moving tent,' if one  may jump from an ancient to an 'Ancient and Modern.' And if that was as  impregnable as I found it, his permanent citadel must be perched upon the  very rock of defence!\"    \"You must tell me about that, Raffles,\" said I, tiring a little of his  kaleidoscopic metaphors. Let him be as allusive as he liked when there  was no risky work on hand, and I was his lucky and delighted audience  till all hours of the night or morning. But for a deed of darkness I  wanted fewer fireworks, a steadier light from his intellectual  lantern. And yet these were the very moments that inspired his  pyrotechnic displays.    \"Oh, I shall tell you all right,\" said Raffles. \"But just now the next  few hours are of more importance than the last few weeks. Of course  Shylock's the man for our money; but knowing our tribesmen as I do, I  think we had better begin by borrowing it like simple Christians.\"    \"Then we have it to pay back again.\"    \"And that's the psychological moment for raiding our 'miser's sunless  coffers'--if he happens to have any. It will give us time to find out.\"    \"But he doesn't keep open office all night,\" I objected.    \"But he opens at nine o'clock in the morning,\" said Raffles, \"to catch  the early stockbroker who would rather be bled than hammered.\"    \"Who told you that?\"    \"Our Mrs. Shylock.\"    \"You must have made great friends with her?\"    \"More in pity than for the sake of secrets.\"    \"But you went where the secrets were?\"    \"And she gave them away wholesale.\"    \"She would,\" I said, \"to you.\"    \"She told me a lot about the impending libel action.\"    \"Shylock _v. Fact?_\"    \"Yes; it's coming on before the vacation, you know.\"    \"So I saw in some paper.\"    \"But you know what it's all about, Bunny?\"    \"No, I don't.\"    \"Another old rascal, the"]]]
