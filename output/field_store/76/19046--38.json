There is sour venom on his  churlish tooth. Is it best to go roundabout, or forward with such a nice  compound of innocence, boldness and modesty as shall satisfy the beast? If  one engross oneself on something that lies to the lee of danger, it allays  suspicion. Or if one absorb oneself upon the flora--a primrose on the  river's brim--it shows him clear and stainless. The stupidest dog should  see that so close a student can have no evil in him. Perhaps it would be  better to throw away one's stick lest it make a show of violence. Or it may  be concealed along the outer leg. Ministers of Grace defend us, what an  excitement in the barnyard! Has virtue no reward? Shall innocence perish  off the earth? Not one dog, but many, come running out. There has gone  a rumor about the barn that there is a stranger to be eaten, and it's  likely--if they keep their clamor--there will be a bone for each. Note how  the valor oozes from the man of peace! Observe his sidling gait, his skirts  pulled close, his hollowed back, his head bent across his shoulder, his  startled eye! Watch him mince his steps, lest a lingering heel be nipped!  Listen to him try the foremost dog with names, to gull him to a belief that  they have met before in happier circumstances! He appeals mutely to the  farmhouse that a recall be sounded. The windows are tightly curtained. The  heavens are comfortless.    You remember the fellow in the play who would have loved war had they not  digged villainous saltpetre from the harmless earth. The countryside, too,  in my opinion, would be more peaceful of a summer afternoon were it not  overrun with dogs. Let me be plain! I myself like dogs--sleepy dogs  blinking in the firelight, friendly dogs with wagging tails, young dogs in  their first puppyhood with their teeth scarce sprouted, whose jaws have not  yet burgeoned into danger, and old dogs, too, who sun themselves and give  forth hollow, toothless, reassuring sounds. When a dog assumes the cozy  habits of the cat without laying off his nobler nature, he is my friend. A  dog of vegetarian aspect pleases me. Let him bear a mild eye as though he  were nourished on the softer foods! I would wish every dog to have a full  complement of tail. It's the sure barometer of his warm regard. There's no  art to find his mind's construction in the face. And I would have him with  not too much curiosity. It's a quality that brings him too often to the  gate. It makes him prone to sniff when one sits upon a visit. Nor do I like  dogs addicted to sudden excitement. Lethargy becomes them better. Let them  be without the Gallic graces! In general, I like a dog to whom I have been  properly introduced, with an exchange of credentials. While the dog is by,  let his master take my hand and address me in softest tones, to cement the  understanding! At bench-shows I love the beasts, although I keep to the  middle of the aisle. The streets are all the safer when so many of the  creatures are kept within.    Frankly, I would enjoy the country more, if I knew that all the dogs were  away on visits. Of course, the highroad is quite safe. Its frequent traffic  is its insurance. Then, too, the barns are at such a distance, it is only a  monstrous anger can bring the dog. But if you are in need of direction you  select a friendly white house with green shutters. You swing open the gate  and crunch across the pebbles to the door. To the nearer eye there is a  look of \"dog\" about the place. Or maybe you are hot and thirsty, and there  is a well at the side of the house. Is it better to gird yourself to danger  or to put off your thirst until the crossroads where pop is sold?    Or a lane leads down to the river. Even at this distance you hear the  shallow brawl of water on the stones. A path goes off across a hill, with  trees beckoning at the top. There is a wind above and a wider sweep of  clouds. Surely, from the crest of the hill the whole county will lie before  you. Such tunes as come up from the world below--a school-bell, a rooster  crowing, children laughing on the road, a threshing machine on the lower  meadows--such tunes are pitched to a marvellous softness. Shall we follow  the hot pavement, or shall we dare those lonely stretches?    There is a kind of person who is steeped too much in valor. He will cross a  field although there is a dog inside the fence. Goodness knows that I would  rather keep to the highroad with such humility as shall not rouse the  creature. Or he will shout and whistle tunes that stir the dogs for miles.  He slashes his stick against the weeds as though in challenge. One might  think that he went about on unfeeling stalks instead of legs as children  walk on stilts, or that a former accident had clipped him off above the  knees and that he was now jointed out of wood to a point beyond the biting  limit. Or perhaps the clothes he wears beneath--the inner mesh and very  balbriggan of his attire--is of so hard a texture that it turns a tooth. Be  these defenses as they may, note with what bravado he mounts the wall! One  leg dangles as though it were baited and were angling for a bite.    There is a French village near Quebec whose population is chiefly dogs.  It lies along the river in a single street, not many miles from the point  where Wolfe climbed to the Plains of Abraham. There are a hundred houses  flat against the roadway and on the steps of each there sits a dog. As I  went through on foot, each of these dogs picked me up, examined me nasally  and passed me on, not generously as though I had stood the test, but rather  in deep suspicion that I was a queer fellow, not to be penetrated at first,  but one who would surely be found out and gobbled before coming to the  end of the street. As long as I would eventually furnish forth the common  banquet, it mattered not which dog took the first nip. Inasmuch as I would  at last be garnished for the general tooth, it would be better to wait  until all were gathered around the platter. \"Good neighbor dog,\" each  seemed to say, \"you too sniff upon the rogue! If he be honest, my old nose  is much at fault.\" Meantime I padded lightly through the village, at first  calling on the dogs by English names, but later using such wisps as I had  of French. \"Aucassin, mon pauvre chien. Voici, Tintagiles, alors donc mon  cherie. Je suis votre ami,\" but with little effect.    But the dogs that one meets in the Canadian woods are of the fiercest  breed. They border on the wolf. They are called huskies and they are so  strong and so fleet of foot that they pull sleds for hours across the  frozen lakes at almost the speed of a running horse. It must be confessed  that they are handsome and if it happens to be your potato peelings and  discarded fish that they eat, they warm into friendliness. Indeed, on these  occasions, one can make quite a show of bravery by stroking and dealing  lightly with them. But once upon a time in an ignorant moment two other  campers and myself followed a lonely railroad track and struck off on a  path through the pines in search of a certain trapper on a fur farm. The  path went on a broken zigzag avoiding fallen trees and soft hollows,  conducting itself on the whole with more patience than firmness. We walked  a quarter of a mile, but still we saw no cabin. The line of the railroad  had long since disappeared. An eagle wheeled above us and quarrelled at our  intrusion. Presently to test our course and learn whether we were coming  near the cabin, we gave a shout. Immediately out of the deeper woods there  came a clamor that froze us. Such sounds, it seemed, could issue only from  bloody and dripping jaws. In a panic, as by a common impulse we turned and  ran. Yet we did not run frankly as when the circus lion is loose, but in a  shamefaced manner--an attempt at a retreat in good order--something between  a walk and a run. At the end of a hundred yards we stopped. No dogs had  fallen on us. Danger had not burst its kennel. We hallooed again, to rouse  the trapper. At last, after a minute of suspense, came his answering voice,  the sweetest sound to be imagined. Whereupon I came down from my high stump  which I had climbed for a longer view.    I am convinced that I am not alone in my--shall I say diffidence?--toward  dogs. Indeed, there is evidence from the oldest times that mankind, in its  more honest moments, has confessed to a fear of dogs. In recognition of  this general fear, the unmuzzled Cerberus was put at the gate of Hades.  It was rightly felt that when the unhappy pilgrims got within, his fifty  snapping heads were better than a bolt upon the door. It was better for  them to endure the ills they had, than be nipped in the upper passage. He,  also, who first spoke the ancient proverb, _Let sleeping dogs lie_, did no  more than voice the caution of the street. And he, also, who invented the  saying that the world is going to the bow-wows, lodged his deplorable  pessimism in fitting words.    It was Daniel who sat with the lions. But there are degrees of bravery. On  Long Street, within sight of my window--just where the street gets into its  most tangled traffic--there has hung for many years the painted signboard  of a veterinary surgeon. Its artist was in the first flourish of youth. Old  age had not yet chilled him when he mixed his gaudy colors. The surgeon's  name is set up in modest letters, but the horse below flames with color.  What a flaring nostril! What an eager eye! How arched the neck! Here is a  wrath and speed unknown to the quadrupeds of this present Long Street. Such  mild-eyed, accumbent, sharp-ribbed horses as now infest the curb--mere  whittlings from a larger age--hang their heads at their degeneracy. Indeed,  these horses seem to their owners not to be worth the price of a nostrum.  If disease settles in them, let them lean against a post until the fit is  past!

Here are materials in abundance for  our garland; advance forward, and fear not the issue;\"--and, gathering  leaves from the boughs of trees of a species unknown to his new  acquaintance, he twined them into a wreath, and placed the sylvan diadem  on Carl's head. The instant that he felt the light pressure on his  temples, all his fears vanished; and he followed his guide, conversing  pleasantly through wide avenues and over broad glades of fresh turf,  which seemed to be laid out like a royal chase, till they came to a wall  of rock resembling the Hahnen Klippers, and entering through an arch, a  grey moss-covered tower arose in the distance. The ponderous doors were  wide open; and Carl advancing, found himself in a large hall well  lighted, and showing abundance of treasure scattered abroad in all  directions. He was conscious that he had lost his companion, but he  seemed no longer to require his instruction; and casting down his own  worthless burthen, he laded himself with the riches that courted his  touch. The adventurer was soon supplied with a sufficient quantity of  gold and jewels to satisfy his most unbounded wishes; and turning from  the spot with a light heart, he sped merrily along. The country round  about seemed strange to him; but on repassing the rocky ledge, a brisk  wind suddenly springing up blew off his cap. The morning air was cold,  and Carl, hastening to regain his head-gear, discovered that the wreath  had disappeared; and, as if awakening from a dream, he found himself  surrounded by familiar objects; he felt, however, the weight of the load  upon his back, and though panting with the fatigue it occasioned, made  the best of his way home. On approaching the hut, a low murmur struck on  his ear. He paused; listened attentively; and distinguishing a female  voice, he rushed forward, and in the next moment clasped Linda in his  arms. She had fled from the persecutions of the bailiff to seek shelter  in Carl's straw-roofed hut; and the now happy lovers, as they surveyed  the treasures which had been snatched from the Nibelungen, agreed that  they owed their good fortune to Riebezhahl the Wood King, who sometimes  taking pity upon the frail and feeble denizens of earth, pointed out to  their wondering eyes the inexhaustible riches of which he was the  acknowledged guardian.    _London Weekly Review_.           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.           *       *       *       *       *      DRAFTS ON LA FITTE.    COOKE.      Only upon one occasion did Cooke deviate from his resolution of not  apologizing to a provincial assembly, and that was at Liverpool. A  previous breach of decorum was visited one night by the fury of an  offended audience; confusion was at its height; the people were the  actors, and Cooke the audience: yet the sturdy tragedian remained  callous to the bursts of indignation which were heard around him, until  destruction became the order of the day; lamps _lighted_ on the stage;  benches betokened _mobility_; _pedal_ applications were made _forte_ to  the _piano_; _basely violated_ was the repository of the _base viol_;  and the property of poor Knight the manager gave every sign of that  being its last appearance. What popular rage had failed to produce,  consideration for the fortunes of his friend effected. At his  entreaties, the Caledonian was induced to advance to the front of the  stage (never was there a more _moving_ scene than that before it);  silence was obtained, and he condescended to express his sorrow for the  state in which some nights previously he had presented himself: adding,  \"that _he_ never _before_ felt so keenly the _degradation_ of _his_  situation.\" Equivocal as was the mode of extenuation, the audience  allied to _Mersey_ accorded the _mercy_ it possessed, and was or  appeared to be, satisfied; but not so the actor, and he as fully as  instantly avenged what he deemed his misplaced submission. As he  concluded his address, he turned to the gratified but yet trembling  manager, and (in allusion to the large share in the slave-trade then  imputed to Liverpool) with that peculiarity of undertone he possessed,  which could be distinctly heard throughout the largest theatre although  pronounced as a whisper, exclaimed, \"There's not a stone in the walls of  Liverpool which has not been cemented by the _bluid_ of Africans.\" Then,  casting one of his Shylock glances of hatred and contempt on the mute  and astounded audience, majestically left the stage.    On the first night of his performance at the Boston theatre, Richard was  the part he had adopted; and so strongly had he fortified himself for  the kingly task, that he deemed himself the very monarch he was destined  to enact. The theatre was crowded in every part: expectation was on  tiptoe: anticipation as to his person, voice, and manner, was announced  by the sibilating \"I guess\" heard around, and \"pretty considerable\"  agitation prevailed. The orchestra had begun and ceased, unheeded or  unheard; nor could one of Sir Thomas Lethbridge's best cut and dried  have produced less effect amongst the \"irreclaimables.\" The curtain  rose, and amidst thundering plaudits the welcome stranger advanced, in  angles, to the front of the stage, and, as Sir Pertinax has it, \"booed  and booed and booed;\" but greeting could not endure for ever: well  justified curiosity assumed its station, and at length silence, almost  breathless silence, reigned around, such as attended Irving in his  Zoar, or Canning when he lately produced his budget. The hospitable  clamour was over; but instead of \"Now is the winter of our discontent  made glorious summer by this sun of York\" being given, Cooke, in a  respectful but decided tone, requested that \"God save the King\" might be  played by the orchestra prior to the commencement of the play. The  proposal at first but excited mockery and laughter, which, however, gave  way to far different feelings, on Cooke firmly and composedly declaring,  that, until his request was complied with, he was determined not to  proceed; and, should it be absolutely refused, he was resolved to  retire. The fury of the Bostonians was at its height: menace,  accompanied by every vituperative epithet rage could suggest, was  lavished on the actor; but he kept his station, calm and secure as his  own native island set in the stormy seas, until anger gradually subsided  through very weariness; and every effort having been ineffectually used  to wean \"_the tyrant_\" from his purpose, the political antipathies of  the audience began to yield to their theatrical taste; and, after much  argument and delay, the unpalatable demand was reluctantly assented to.  Cooke, however, whose nature it was, when opposed, only to become more  exigent, was not himself appeased; for, as the notes \"unpleasing to a  _Yankee_ ear\" were sounded, with a majestic wave of his hand he silenced  the unwilling music, and, \"Standing, if you please,\" was as  dictatorially as fearlessly pronounced, to the consternation of the  audience. So much had, however, already been accorded, that it was not  deemed matter of much moment to concede the rest: and however  ungracefully the attitude of respect was assumed, the national hymn was  performed amidst grimace and muttering; Cooke beating time with his  foot,--nodding significantly and satisfactorily at \"Confound their  politics;\" and occasionally taking a pinch of snuff, as, in his royal  robes, he triumphantly contemplated the astonished and indignant  audience. It ended:--\"Richard was himself again,\" and \"_Now_ is the  winter of our _discontent_ made glorious summer\" was given with equal  emphasis, feeling, and effect.    At the time that _greater_ performer, the elephant, made his appearance  on the boards, his own _board_ became a subject of no trifling  consideration with the managers, particularly as the African had taken a  predilection for _rum_, which the new actor used to quaff with  extraordinary zest. On one occasion Cooke was missing from a morning  rehearsal, and all had been some time in waiting for the tragedian,  when the messenger whom Kerable despatched in search of him, returned  grinning to the green-room. \"Where is Mr. Cooke, sir?\" demanded Kemble.  \"He is below _breakfasting_ with the _elephant_, sir!\" was the reply.    It was too much for Cooke, after having so frequently disappointed full  houses, to be obliged to play to an empty theatre. It was like playing  whist with _dummy_. However, towards the close of the O. P. war, (which,  by the way, excited more the attention of the Parisians than the  national contest in which we were engaged,) the public had adopted the  plan of never commencing operations until half-price, to the injury of  the manager's purse. It was during the earlier acts of \"The Man of the  World,\" that Cooke, in performing to \"a beggarly account of empty  boxes,\" was addressed by one of the actors, in accordance with the  scene, in a whisper; when the _elevated_ comedian, casting a glance  around, bitterly observed, \"Speak out: there need be no secret. _No one  hears us._\" Poor Cooke could not plead in excuse what an actor did on  being hissed for too _sober_ a representation of a _drunken_ part,  \"Ladies and gentlemen, I beg your pardon: but it is really the _first  time_ I ever was _intoxicated_.\"    His death was in singular accordance with his _taste_ through life. He  sought the banks of the _Brandywine_, and whether it were that the  composition of its stream so little responded to its title as to prey  upon his _spirits_, or from some other cause, there he \"_drank_ his  last.\"      DICKEY SUETT.
