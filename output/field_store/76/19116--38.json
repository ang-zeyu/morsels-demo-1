We copy this  from a communication of Mr. Cumberland to Brande's Journal, and are  truly pleased to record such amiable examples of female excellence in  scientific pursuits. At Dover, Portsmouth, and other places we could  name, we obtained the best information respecting the fossils of the  coast, from females resident there, and we need not add that this  circumstance imparted additional interest to our inquiries.           *       *       *       *       *      _The Zoological Society._      We copy the following from the Report to the Zoological Society, just  published:    \"In the Museum in Bruton-street various improvements have taken place.  Additional cases have been erected, wherever space could be obtained,  for the exhibition of the different collections; and two persons have  been in constant employment in preparing and setting up the more  interesting specimens. An assistant has also been lately added, for the  arrangement of the shells, insects, and the other smaller subjects of  the collection; and much care has been bestowed upon the various  departments of comparative anatomy. An instructive as well as an  attractive series in every branch of zoology, but more particularly in  the groups of mammalia, birds, and insects, has thus been arranged for  inspection. A catalogue of the more important objects in the Museum has  been published; and a more detailed list, accompanied with scientific  notices of all the species, is in preparation.    \"The increase in the number of subjects in the collection during the  last year has been considerable, and many of the additions have been of  the utmost importance to science. The whole of these, with a few  exceptions, have been presented by the friends of the society. A  detailed list of these donations which are too numerous for insertion in  this report, is laid upon the table; a reference to the contents of  which will evince that the spirit of liberality, which laid the  foundations of this already valuable collection, has not decreased.    \"A very extensive correspondence has been established with naturalists  of foreign countries, and persons resident in distant parts, who are  anxious to promote the objects of the Society. Through these channels  many valuable acquisitions have been already received; and it is  expected that much of novelty and interest will continually pour in to  increase the attractions of the Museum and Menagerie.    \"The Garden in the Regent's Park is the principal source of attraction  and of expense. The nature of the soil, which consists of a thick  ungrateful clay, increases the cost of every work. The health of the  animals requires that oak floors be raised above the surface of the  ground; and it is necessary to lay a thick substratum of dry material  under every inclosure and every walk. These disadvantages are however  amply counterbalanced by its immediate vicinity to the town. The Council  have, notwithstanding the nature of the soil, endeavoured to give to the  garden all the attractions which good cultivation and an abundance of  flowers can afford: and they have to return their thanks for the very  liberal supplies for this purpose which they have occasionally received  from the Horticultural Society. The resort to the garden has far  surpassed the most sanguine expectations of the Council; 112,226 persons  have visited it during the last year.\"           *       *       *       *       *        THE NOVELIST             *       *       *       *       *      THE SIEGE OF ABYDOS.    _A Romantic Tale._    (_For the Mirror._)      The infidel Turks, ever at variance with the Christians, were, in the  reign of king Orchanes, extremely ambitious to possess the famous Castle  of Abydos; and accordingly vast preparations were made for a close  siege. Previous to the arrival of the Turkish army before the castle,  the angelic Sophronia, daughter of the governor of Abydos, was visited  by a dream. She thought, that while walking out on a beautiful evening,  breathing the fragrant air, and gazing on the brilliant stars, she fell  into a loathsome ditch, in which she remained an hour, terrified, and  unable to move. At length, a handsome youth passed, and she implored him  to rescue her. She did not implore in vain; the young man assisted her  out, cleaned her clothes, and comforted her with pleasant words. They  then proceeded to a delightful bower, put on costly attire, and the  youth regaled the rescued lady with delicious fruits, and sang sonnets  on her personal beauty. Sophronia awoke, sad and disappointed, to find  that her late bliss was only a dream. In a day or two afterwards, the  Turkish army appeared, and a vigorous siege commenced; nevertheless, the  Christians stoutly defended the place, and would, ultimately, have  obliged the enemy to retire, had no intervention taken place. It  happened, unfortunately for the garrison, that a gallant Turkish  captain, in the prime of youth, called Abdurachman approached so near to  the castle gates, as to be plainly observed by the fair Sophronia, from  a small turret window, out of which she had viewed the besiegers. The  lady imagined this captain to be the person to whom she was so much  obliged in her dream, and rejoiced at the supposed discovery; she hoped  that the assailants would be successful in taking her father's castle  that she might have an opportunity of falling into the hands of the  gallant captain she so greatly admired. The siege still raged with much  fury, but was continually repulsed by the brave Christians, insomuch  that the Turkish general became disconcerted, and in the evening of the  third day after the commencement of the siege, retired to his camp,  about a league distant from the scene of action. Sophronia, meanwhile,  was agitated at the ill success of the Turks, though she did not despair  of seeing the captain again.    She made a confidante of her maid Annis, who undertook, daring as the  attempt was, to steal from the castle to the enemy's camp, in order to  convey a letter from her mistress to Abdurachman. The intrepid Annis  commenced her task in the night: she avoided passing the sentinels and  wardens of the castle, but found her way to a postern gate, scarcely  known to any but herself. She arrived at Abdurachman's tent; the captain  was conversing with his friends about what the general intended to do on  the morrow. Annis desired to speak with him in private, to which he  consented. She then delivered the letter, which was bound with a lock of  the fair writer's hair, and the astonished Abdurachman perused the  following:--    \"Adored Youth,    \"I am passionately in love with you, and am sorry that you have been  frustrated in your endeavours to take the castle. As I adore you beyond  measure, and shall certainly take poison if you do not succeed; I engage  to deliver Abydos with all its riches into your hands, provided you  follow my instructions. I advise, that in the morning by sunrise, you  raise the siege and withdraw your whole army from the castle, and return  not again till you hear from _me_. My father will be so rejoiced at your  departure, that he will be off his guard, and then I can easily conduct  you with secrecy into the castle.\"    The delighted Turk very politely answered this remarkable _billet doux_,  assuring the fair writer that he was at her service, and that he would  implicitly follow her directions as to the taking of Abydos. As soon as  he had dismissed Annis, he flew with Sophronia's letter to the general,  who, upon reading it, expressed great astonishment; he determined to  raise the siege the next morning, and resolved to rely fully on the  beautiful traitress for the future success of his enterprise. The next  day came, and the general raised the siege and departed. The Christians  were rejoiced to see it, and in the evening made merry and drunk wine.  The governor's daughter took advantage of the garrison at this unguarded  moment; and fearing to trust again to the sincerity of her maid,  resolved to proceed herself to Abdurachman's tent. Annis led the way.  The night was serene, and the light of the moon showed the stately  castle of Abydos, dark and majestic. No noise was heard, save the heavy  and uniform step of the sentinels, whose bright arms, as they caught the  moon's rays, sparkled against the gloomy looking building. Little did  the inmates, now as tranquil as the night, dream of being surprised by  an enemy; and little did the brave governor imagine that his own beloved  daughter, at this moment, was treacherously hastening to a merciless  foe, with the intent to conduct him to Abydos! Sophronia reached her  lover's tent weary and faint, for she had walked with great haste. She  sank into the captain's arms, and then, almost inaudibly, informed him  that not a moment was to be lost, and that he must follow her  immediately "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11464"],[0,"Cuba, Old and New (#5)"],[1," 1528, called the _derecho_ _de averia_,  required the payment of 20 ducats ($16) by every person, bond or free,  arriving in the island. In 1665 this tax was increased to $22, and  continued in force to 1765, thus retarding immigration, and, to that  extent, the increase of population, especially of the laboring class.    \"An examination of these taxes will show their excessive, arbitrary, and  unscientific character, and how they operated to discourage Cubans from  owning property or engaging in many industrial pursuits tending to benefit  them and to promote the material improvement of the island.    \"Taxes on real estate were estimated by the tax inspector on the basis  of its rental or productive capacity, and varied from 4 to 12 per cent.  Similarly, a nominal municipal tax of 25 per cent was levied on the  estimated profits of all industries and commerce, and on the income derived  from all professions, manual occupations, or agencies, the collector  receiving 6 per cent of all taxes assessed. Much unjust discrimination was  made against Cubans in determining assessable values and in collecting the  taxes, and it is said that bribery in some form was the only effective  defense against the most flagrant impositions.\"    Some of the experiences of this period will be considered in special  chapters on Cuba's alleged revolutions and on the relations of the United  States to Cuba and its affairs. One point may be noted here. The wave of  republicanism that swept over a considerable part of Europe and over the  Western Hemisphere, from 1775 to 1825 had its direct influence in Spain,  and an influence only less direct in Cuba. In 1812, Spain became a  constitutional monarchy. It is true that the institution had only a  brief life, but the sentiment that lay beneath it persisted and had been  repeatedly a cause of disturbance on the Peninsula. Something of the  same sentiment pervaded Cuba and excited ambitions, not for national  independence, but for some participation in government. A royal decree, in  1810, gave Cuba representation in the Cortes, and two deputies from the  island took part in framing the Constitution of 1812. This recognition of  Cuba lasted for only two years, the Constitution being abrogated in 1814,  but it was restored in 1820, only to cease again three years later.  Representatives were again admitted to the Cortes in 1834, and again  excluded in 1837. The effect of all this was, perhaps, psychological rather  than practical, but it gave rise to a new mental attitude and to some  change in conduct. The effect appears in the numerous recurrences of open  protest and passive resistance in the place of the earlier submission.  Writing in 1855, Mr. J.S. Thrasher stated that \"the essential political  elements of the island are antagonistic to those of the mother-country.  While the Cortes and the crown have frequently declared that Cuba does not  form an integral part of the Spanish monarchy, but must be governed by  special laws not applicable to Spain, and persist in ruling her under the  erroneous and unjust European colonial system, the growing wealth and  increasing intelligence of the Cubans lead them to aspire to some share in  the elimination of the political principles under which their own affairs  shall be administered. A like antagonism exists in the economic relations  of the two countries. While the people of Cuba are not averse to the  raising of such revenue as may be required for the proper wants of the  State, in the administration of which they may participate, they complain,  with a feeling of national pride, that fiscal burdens of the most onerous  kind are laid upon them for the expressed purpose of advancing interests  which are in every sense opposed to their own. Thus, Spain imposes taxes to  support a large army and navy, the principal object of which is to prevent  any expression of the public will on the part of the people of Cuba.  Another class of impositions have for their object the diversion of  the trade of Cuba to channels which shall increase the profits of the  agriculturists and mariners of Spain without regard to the interests of the  people of the island.\"    [Illustration: A PLANTER'S HOME _Havana Province_]    Yet in spite of these severe restrictions and heavy burdens, Cuba shows a  considerable progress during the first half of the century. It is far from  easy to reach fair conclusions from contemporaneous writings. Naturally,  Spanish officials and Spanish writers strove to make the best possible case  for Spain, its policies and its conduct. The press of the island was either  under official control or stood in fear of official reprisals. The Cuban  side, naturally partisan, appears to have been presented chiefly by  fugitive pamphlets, more or less surreptitiously printed and distributed,  usually the product of political extremists. Among these was a man of  marked ability and of rare skill in the use of language. He was Don Antonio  Saco, known in Cuba as the \"Immortal Saco.\" In a letter written to a  friend, in 1846, he says, \"The tyranny of our mother-country, today most  acute, will have this result--that within a period of time not very remote  the Cubans will be compelled to take up arms to banish her.\" That British  observers and most American observers should take the side of the Cubans is  altogether natural. Writing in 1854, Mr. M.M. Ballou, in his _History of  Cuba_, says: \"The Cubans owe all the blessings they enjoy to Providence  alone (so to speak), while the evils which they suffer are directly  referable to the oppression of the home government. Nothing short of a  military despotism could maintain the connection of such an island with a  mother-country more than three thousand miles distant; and accordingly we  find the captain-general of Cuba invested with unlimited power. He is, in  fact, a viceroy appointed by the crown of Spain, and accountable only to  the reigning sovereign for his administration of the colony. His rule is  absolute; he has the power of life and death and liberty in his hands. He  can, by his arbitrary will, send into exile any person whatever, be his  name or rank what it may, whose residence in the island he considers  prejudicial to the royal interest, even if he has committed no overt act.  He can suspend the operation of the laws and ordinances, if he sees fit to  do so; can destroy or confiscate property; and, in short, the island may be  said to be perpetually in a state of siege.\"    The student or the reader may take his choice. On one side are Spanish  statements, official and semi-official, and on the other side, Cuban  statements no less partisan. The facts appear to support the Cuban  argument. In spite of the severe restrictions and the heavy burdens, Cuba  shows a notable progress during the 19th Century. Governors came and went,  some very good and others very bad. There were a hundred of them from 1512  to 1866, and thirty-six more from 1866 to 1899, the average term of service  for the entire number being a little less than three years. On the whole,  the most notable of the group of 19th Century incumbents was Don Miguel  Tacon, who ruled from June 1, 1834, until April 16, 1838. His record would  seem to place him quite decidedly in the \"reactionary\" class, but he was a  man of action who left behind him monuments that remain to his credit even  now. One historian, Mr. Kimball, who wrote in 1850, describes him as one  in whom short-sightedness, narrow views, and jealous and weak mind, were  joined to an uncommon stubbornness of character. Another, Mr. M.M. Ballou,  says that \"probably of all the governors-general that have filled the post  in Cuba none is better known abroad, or has left more monuments to his  enterprise, than Tacon. His reputation at Havana (this was written 1854) is  of a somewhat doubtful character; for, though he followed out with energy  various improvements, yet his modes of procedure were so violent that he  was an object of terror to the people generally, rather than of gratitude.  He vastly improved the appearance of the capital and its vicinity, built  the new prison, rebuilt the governor's palace, constructed a military road  to the neighboring forts, erected a spacious theatre and market house,  arranged a new public walk, and opened a vast parade ground without the  city walls, thus laying the foundation of the new city which has now sprung  up in this formerly desolate suburb. He suppressed the gaming houses and  rendered the streets, formerly infested with robbers, as secure as those of  Boston or New York.\" Another writer, Mr. Samuel Hazard, in 1870, says: \"Of  all the governors who have been in command of the island Governor Tacon  seems to have been the best, doing the most to improve the island, and  particularly Havana; making laws, punishing offences, and establishing some  degree of safety for its inhabitants. It is reported of him that he is  said, like the great King Alfred, to have promised the Cubans that they  should be able to leave their purses of money on the public highway without  fear of having them stolen. At all events, his name is cherished by every  Cuban for the good he has done, and _paseos_, theatres, and monuments bear  his great name in Havana.\" The Tacon theatre is now the Nacional, and the  Paseo Tacon is now Carlos III. The \"new prison\" is the _Carcel_, or jail,  at the northern end of the Prado, near the fortress of La Punta. Don Miguel  may have been disliked for his methods and his manners, but he certainly  did much to make his rule memorable.    There is no reliable information that shows the progress of the island  during the 19th Century. Even the census figures are questioned. A reported  432,000 total population in 1804 is evidently no more than an estimate, yet  it is very likely not far from the actual. Concerning their distribution  throughout the island, and the number engaged in different occupations,"]]]
