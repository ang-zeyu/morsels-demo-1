Hast thou not heard how the fox bound the lion and slew him with    cunning?\" \"How did the fox dare,\" asked the leopard, \"to come near enough    to the lion to do it?\"    The wife than takes up the parable, and cites the incident of      THE FOX AND THE LION      Then said the leopard's wife: The lion loved the fox, but the fox had no    faith in him, and plotted his death. One day the fox went to the lion    whining that a pain had seized him in the head. \"I have heard,\" said the    fox, \"that physicians prescribe for a headache, that the patient shall be    tied up hand and foot.\" The lion assented, and bound up the fox with a    cord. \"Ah,\" blithely said the fox, \"my pain is gone.\" Then the lion    loosed him. Time passed, and the lion's turn came to suffer in his head.    In sore distress he went to the fox, fast as a bird to the snare, and    exclaimed, \"Bind me up, brother, that I, too, may be healed, as happened    with thee.\" The fox took fresh withes, and bound the lion up. Then he    went to fetch great stones, which he cast on the lion's head, and thus    crushed him. \"Therefore, my dear leopard,\" concluded his wife, \"trust not    the fox, for I fear him and his wiles. If the place he tells of be so    fair, why does not the fox take it for himself?\" \"Nay,\" said the leopard,    \"thou art a silly prattler. I have often proved my friend, and there is    no dross in the silver of his love.\"      The leopard would not hearken to his wife's advice, yet he was somewhat  moved by her warning, and he told the fox of his misgiving, adding, that  his wife refused to accompany him. \"Ah,\" replied the fox, \"I fear your fate  will be like the silversmith's; let me tell you his story, and you will  know how silly it is to listen to a wife's counsel.\"      THE SILVERSMITH WHO FOLLOWED HIS WIFE'S COUNSEL      A silversmith of Babylon, skilful in his craft, was one day at work.    \"Listen to me,\" said his wife, \"and I will make thee rich and honored.    Our lord, the king, has an only daughter, and he loves her as his life.    Fashion for her a silver image of herself, and I will bear it to her as a    gift.\" The statue was soon made, and the princess rejoiced at seeing it.    She gave a cloak and earrings to the artist's wife, and she showed them    to her husband in triumph. \"But where is the wealth and the honor?\" he    asked. \"The statue was worth much more than thou hast brought.\" Next day    the king saw the statue in his daughter's hand, and his anger was    kindled. \"Is it not ordered,\" he cried, \"that none should make an image?    Cut off his right hand.\" The king's command was carried out, and daily    the smith wept, and exclaimed, \"Take warning from me, ye husbands, and    obey not the voice of your wives.\"      The leopard shuddered when he heard this tale; but the fox went on:      THE WOODCUTTER AND THE WOMAN      A hewer of wood in Damascus was cutting logs, and his wife sat spinning    by his side. \"My departed father,\" she said, \"was a better workman than    thou. He could chop with both hands: when the right hand was tired, he    used the left.\" \"Nay,\" said he, \"no woodcutter does that, he uses his    right hand, unless he be a left-handed man.\" \"Ah, my dear,\" she    entreated, \"try and do it as my father did.\" The witless wight raised his    left hand to hew the wood, but struck his right-hand thumb instead.    Without a word he took the axe and smote her on the head, and she died.    His deed was noised about; the woodcutter was seized and stoned for his    crime. Therefore, continued the fox, I say unto thee, all women are    deceivers and trappers of souls. And let me tell you more of these wily    stratagems.      The fox reinforces his argument by relating an episode in which a contrast  is drawn between      MAN'S LOVE AND WOMAN'S      A king of the Arabs, wise and well-advised, was one day seated with his    counsellors, who were loud in the praise of women, lauding their virtues    and their wisdom. \"Cut short these words,\" said the king. \"Never since    the world began has there been a good woman. They love for their own    ends.\" \"But,\" pleaded his sages, \"O King, thou art hasty. Women there    are, wise and faithful and spotless, who love their husbands and tend    their children.\" \"Then,\" said the king, \"here is my city before you:    search it through, and find one of the good women of whom you speak.\"    They sought, and they found a woman, chaste and wise, fair as the moon    and bright as the sun, the wife of a wealthy trader; and the counsellors    reported about her to the king. He sent for her husband, and received him    with favor. \"I have something for thy ear,\" said the king. \"I have a good    and desirable daughter: she is my only child; I will not give her to a    king or a prince: let me find a simple, faithful man, who will love her    and hold her in esteem. Thou art such a one; thou shalt have her. But    thou art married: slay thy wife to-night, and to-morrow thou shalt wed my    daughter.\" \"I am unworthy,\" pleaded the man, \"to be the shepherd of thy    flock, much less the husband of thy daughter.\" But the king would take no    denial. \"But how shall I kill my wife? For fifteen years she has eaten of    my bread and drunk of my cup. She is the joy of my heart; her love and    esteem grow day by day.\" \"Slay her,\" said the king, \"and be king    hereafter.\" He went forth from the presence, downcast and sad, thinking    over, and a little shaken by, the king's temptation. At home he saw his    wife and his two babes. \"Better,\" he cried, \"is my wife than a kingdom.    Cursed be all kings who tempt men to sip sorrow, calling it joy.\" The    king waited his coming in vain; and then he sent messengers to the man's    shop. When he found that the man's love had conquered his lust, he said,    with a sneer, \"Thou art no man: thy heart is a woman's.\"      In the evening the king summoned the woman secretly. She came, and the    king praised her beauty and her wisdom. His heart, he said, was burning    with love for her, but he could not wed another man's wife. \"Slay thy    husband to-night, and tomorrow be my queen.\" With a smile, the woman    consented; and the king gave her a sword made of tin, for he knew the    weak mind of woman. \"Strike once,\" he said to her; \"the sword is sharp;    you need not essay a second blow.\" She gave her husband a choice repast,    and wine to make him drunken. As he lay asleep, she grasped the sword and    struck him on the head; and the tin bent, and he awoke. With some ado she    quieted him, and he fell asleep again. Next morning the king summoned    her, and asked whether she had obeyed his orders. \"Yes,\" said she, \"but    thou didst frustrate thine own counsel.\" Then the king assembled his    sages, and bade her tell all that she had attempted; and the husband,    too, was fetched, to tell his story. \"Did I not tell you to cease your    praises of women?\" asked the king, triumphantly.      IN DISPRAISE OF WOMAN    The fox follows up these effective narratives with a lengthy string of  well-worn quotations against women, of which the following are a few:  Socrates, the wise and saintly, hated and despised them. His wife was thin  and short. They asked him, \"How could a man like you choose such a woman  for your wrife?\" \"I chose,\" said Socrates, \"of the evil the least possible  amount.\" \"Why, then, do you look on beautiful women?\" \"Neither,\" said  Socrates, \"from love nor from desire, but to admire the handiwork of God in  their outward form. It is within that they are foul.\" Once he was walking  by the way, and he saw a woman hanging from a fig-tree. \"Would,\" said  Socrates, \"that all the fruit were like this.\"--A nobleman built a new  house, and wrote over the door, \"Let nothing evil pass this way.\" \"Then how  does his wife go in?\" asked Diogenes.--\"Your enemy is dead,\" said one to  another. \"I would rather hear that he had got married,\" was the reply.    \"So much,\" said the fox to the leopard, \"I have told thee that thou mayest  know how little women are to be trusted. They deceive men in life, and  betray them in death.\" \"But,\" queried the leopard, \"what could my wife do  to harm me after I am dead?\" \"Listen,\" rejoined the fox, \"and I will tell  thee of a deed viler than any I have narrated hitherto.\"      THE WIDOW AND HER HUSBAND'S CORPSE      The kings of Rome, when they hanged a man, denied him burial until the    tenth day. That the friends and relatives of the victim might not steal    the body, an officer of high rank was set to watch the tree by night. If    the body was stolen, the officer was hung up in its place. A knight of    high degree once rebelled against the king, and he was hanged on a tree.    The officer on guard was startled at midnight to hear a piercing shriek    of anguish from a little distance; he mounted his horse, and rode towards    the voice, to discover the meaning. He came to an open grave, where the    common people were buried, and saw a weeping woman loud in laments for    her departed spouse. He sent her home with words of comfort, accompanying    her to the city gate. He then returned to his post. Next night the same    scene was repeated, and as the officer spoke his gentle soothings to her,    a love for him was born in her heart, and her dead husband was forgotten.    And as they spoke words of love, they neared the tree, and lo! the body    that the officer was set to watch was gone. \"Begone,\" he said, \"and I    will fly, or my life must pay the penalty of my dalliance.\" \"Fear not, my    lord,\" she said, \"we can raise my husband from his grave and hang him    instead of the stolen corpse.\" \"But I fear the Prince of Death. I cannot    drag a man from his grave.\" \"I alone will do it then,\" said the woman; \"I    will dig him out; it is lawful to cast a dead man from the grave, to keep    a live man from being thrown in.\" \"Alas!\" cried the officer, when she had  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],[0,"Introductory American History (#4)"],[1,"   important was carried on in the city. The cities were usually    surrounded by high, thick stone walls, which made them safe from    sudden attack. Within or beside the city there was often a lofty hill,    which we should call a fort or citadel, but which they called the    upper city or acropolis. There the people lived at first when they    were few in number, and thither they fled if the walls of their city    were broken down by enemies.      In Athens such a hill rose two hundred feet above the plain. Its top    was a thousand feet long, and all the sides except one were steep    cliffs. On it the Athenians built their most beautiful temples.    PRIVATE HOUSES. Unlike people nowadays the Greeks did not spend much    money on their dwelling-houses. To us these houses would seem small,    badly ventilated, and very uncomfortable. But what their houses lacked    was more than made up by the beauty and splendor of the public    buildings, halls, theaters, porticoes, and especially the temples.    TEMPLES. The temples were not intended to hold hundreds of worshipers    like the large churches of Europe and America to-day. Religious    ceremonies were most often carried on in the open air. The Parthenon,    the most famous temple of Ancient Times, was small. Its principal room    measured less than one hundred feet in length. Part of this room was    used for an altar and for the ivory and gold statue of the goddess    Athena.      [Illustration: THE ACROPOLIS AT ATHENS AS IT IS TO-DAY]    THE PARTHENON. In a picture of the Parthenon, or of a similar temple,    we notice the columns in front and along the sides. The Parthenon had    eight at each end and seventeen on each side. They were thirty-four    feet high. A few feet within the columns on the sides was the wall of    the temple. Before the vestibule and entrances at the front and at the    rear stood six more columns. The beauty of the marble from which    stones and columns were cut might have seemed enough, but the builders    carved groups of figures in the three-cornered space (called the    pediment) in front between the roof and the stones resting upon the    columns. The upper rows of stones beneath the roof and above the    columns were also carved, and continuous carvings (called a frieze)    ran around the top of the temple wall on the outside. The temple was    not left a glistening white, but parts of it were painted in blue, or    red, or gilt, or orange.      [Illustration: THE TOP OF THE ACROPOLIS 2000 YEARS AGO The    Parthenon is the large temple on the right]    OTHER GREEK TEMPLES. This beautiful temple is now partly ruined. Ruins    of other temples are on the Acropolis, and one better preserved,    called the Theseum, stands on a lower hill. There are also similar    ruins in many places along the shores of the Mediterranean. The most    interesting are at Paestum in Italy, and at Girgenti in Sicily. Long    before these temples were ruined they had taught the Romans how to    construct one of the most beautiful kinds of buildings, and this the    Romans later taught the peoples of western Europe.    GREEK METHODS OF BUILDING STILL USED. If we look at our large    buildings, we shall see much to remind us of the Greek buildings.    Sometimes the exact form of the Greek building is imitated; sometimes    this form is changed as the Romans changed it, or as it was changed by    builders who lived after the time of the Romans. If the model of the    whole building is not used, there are similar pillars, or gables, or    the sculpture in the pediment and the frieze is imitated. The Greeks    had three kinds of pillars, named Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. The    Doric is simple and solid, the Ionic shows in its capital, or top,    delicate and beautiful curves, while the Corinthian is adorned with    leaves springing gracefully from the top of the pillar.      [Illustration: Doric Ionic Corinthian GREEK ORDERS OF    ARCHITECTURE]      [Illustration: RUINS OF THE GREEK THEATER AT EPIDAURUS]    THEATERS. The first Greek theater was only a smooth open space near a    hillside, with a tent, called a _skene_, or scene, in which the    actors dressed. Later an amphitheater of stone seats was constructed    on the hillside, and across the open end was placed the _scene_,    which had been changed into a stone building. On its front sometimes a    house or a palace was painted, just as nowadays theaters are furnished    with painted scenery. In these open-air theaters thousands of people    gathered. Plays were generally given as a part of religious festivals,    and there were contests between writers to see which could produce the    best play. Sometimes the plays followed one another for three days    from morning until night. Many of them are so interesting that people    still read them, after twenty-five hundred years. The Romans studied    them, and so do modern men who are preparing themselves to write    plays.      [Illustration: THE MODERN STADIUM AT ATHENS]    THE STADIUM. A building which somewhat resembled the theater was the    stadium, where races were run. The difference was that it was oblong    instead of half round. The most famous stadium, at Olympia, was seven    hundred and two feet long, with raised seats on both sides and around    one end of the running track. The other end was open. About fifty    thousand persons used to gather there to watch the races.    PORTICOES. There were other buildings, some for meeting places, some    for gymnasiums, and still others called porticoes, where the judges    held court or the city officers carried on their business. The    porticoes were simply rows of columns, roofed over, with occasionally    a second story. As they stretched along the sides of a square or    market place they added much to the beauty of a city.    GREEK SCULPTURE. We know that the Greeks were skilful sculptors    because from the ruins of their cities have been dug wonderful marble    and bronze statues which are now preserved in the great museums of the    world, in Paris, London, Berlin, and Rome, and here in America, in New    York and Boston. Museums which cannot have the original statues    usually contain copies or casts of them in plaster. The statues are    generally marred and broken, but enough remains to show us the    wonderful beauty of the artist's work. Among the most famous are the    Venus, of Melos (or \"de Milo\"), which stands in a special room in a    museum called the Louvre in Paris; the Hermes in the museum of Olympia    in Greece; and the figures from the Parthenon in the British Museum in    London.      [Illustration: THE DISCUS-THROWER (DISCOBOLOS) An ancient    Greek statue now in the Vatican]      Artists nowadays, like the Roman artists long ago, study the Greek    statues and the Greek sculpture, in order that they may learn how such    beautiful things can be made. They do not hope to excel the Greeks,    but are content to remain their pupils.    PAINTING AND POTTERY. The Greeks were also painters, makers of    pottery, and workers in gold and silver. Many pieces of their    workmanship have been discovered by those who have dug in the ruins of    ancient buildings and tombs.      [Illustration: A GREEK BOOK The upper picture, shows the book    open.]    WHAT THE BOYS WERE TAUGHT. The Greek boys were not very good at    arithmetic, and even grown men used counting boards or their fingers    to help them in reckoning. In learning to write they smeared a thin    layer of wax over a board and marked on that. There was a kind of    paper called papyrus, made from a reed which grew mostly in Egypt, but    this was expensive. Rolls were made of sheets of it pasted together,    and these were their books. One of the books the boys studied much was    the poems of Homer--the Iliad and the Odyssey--which tell about the    siege of Troy and the wanderings of Ulysses. Boys often learned these    long poems by heart. They also stored away in their memories the    sayings of other poets and wise men, so that they could generally know    what to think, having with them so many good and wise thoughts put in    such excellent words.    GAMES AND EXERCISES FOR BOYS. It is not surprising that Greek boys    knew how to play, but it is surprising that they played many of the    games which boys play now, such as hide-and-seek, tug of war, ducks    and drakes, and blind man's buff. They even \"pitched pennies.\" In    school the boys were taught not only to read and write, but to be    skilful athletes, and to play on the lyre, accompanying this with    singing. The gymnasium was often an open space near a stream into    which they could plunge after their exercises were over. They were    taught to box, to wrestle, to throw the discus, and to hurl the spear.    Military training was important for them, since all might be called to    fight for the safety of their city.    THE OLYMPIC GAMES. Boys and young men were trained as runners,    wrestlers, boxers, and discus throwers, not only because they enjoyed    these exercises and the Greeks thought them an important part of    education, but also that they might bring back honors and prizes to    their city from the great games which all the Greeks held every few    years. The most famous of these games were held at Olympia. There the    Greeks went from all parts of the country, carrying their tents and    cooking utensils with them, because there were not enough houses in    Olympia to hold so many people. Wars even were stopped for a time in    order that the games might not be postponed.    THE REWARDS OF THE VICTORS. The principal contest was a dash for two    hundred yards, although there were longer races and many other kinds    of contests. Unfortunately the Greeks liked to see the most brutal    sort of boxing, in which the boxer's hands and arms were covered with    heavy strips of leather stiffened with pieces of iron or lead.
