The reaction from these  Russophil festivities left him in a weakened condition, and, feeling  unequal to creative effort, he translated Racine's _Phedre_ into  German verse, finishing it in February, 1805. Then he returned with  great zest to his Russian play _Demetrius_, of which enough was  written to indicate that it might have become his masterpiece. But the  flame had burnt itself out. Toward the end of April he took a cold  which led to a violent fever with delirium. The end came on May 9,  1805.    [Illustration: SCHILLER AT THE COURT OF WEIMAR]    No attempt can here be made at a general estimate of Schiller's  dramatic genius. The serious poetic drama, such as he wrote in his  later years, is no longer in favor anywhere. In Germany, as in our own  land, the temper of the time is on the whole hostile to that form of  art. We demand, very properly, a drama attuned to the life of the  present; one occupied, as we say, with living issues. Yet Schiller is  very popular on the German stage. After the lapse of a century, and  notwithstanding the fact that he _seems_ to speak to us from the  clouds, he holds his own. Why is this? It is partly because of a  quality of his art that has been called his \"monumental  fresco-painting\"; that is, his strong and luminous portraiture of the  great historic forces that have shaped the destiny of nations. These  forces are matters of the spirit, of the inner life; and they persist  from age to age, but little affected by the changing fashion of the  theatre. The reader of Schiller soon comes to feel that he deals with  issues that are alive because they are immortal.    Another important factor in his classicity is the suggestion that goes  out from his idealized personality. German sentiment has set him on a  high pedestal and made a hero of him, so that his word is not exactly  as another man's word. Something of this was felt by those about him  even in his lifetime. Says Karoline von Wolzogen: \"High seriousness  and the winsome grace of a pure and noble soul were always present in  Schiller's conversation; in listening to him one walked as among the  changeless stars of heaven and the flowers of earth.\" This is the  tribute of a partial friend, but it describes very well the impression  produced by Schiller's writings. His love of freedom and beauty, his  confidence in reason, his devotion to the idea of humanity, seem to  exhale from his work and to invest it with a peculiar distinction. His  plays and poems are a priceless memento to the spirit of a great and  memorable epoch. Hundreds of writers have said their say about him,  but no better word has been spoken than the noble tribute of Goethe:      For he was ours. So let the note of pride    Hush into silence all the mourner's ruth;    In our safe harbor he was fain to bide    And build for aye, after the storm of youth.    We saw his mighty spirit onward stride    To eternal realms of Beauty and of Truth;    While far behind him lay fantasmally    The vulgar things that fetter you and me.           *       *       *       *       *    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: Translated by Edward, Lord Lytton.]    [Footnote 2: This Sonnet, by the author of this sketch of Schiller's  life, was written for the Chicago Schiller Celebration of 1905, but  has not been printed before.

With thy joy, thy melancholy,         Wilt thou thus relentless flee?       O Golden Time, O Human May,         Can nothing, Fleet One, thee restraint?    Must thy sweet river glide away    Into the eternal Ocean Main?      The suns serene are lost and vanish'd      That wont the path of youth to gild,    And all the fair Ideals banish'd      From that wild heart they whilome fill'd.    Gone the divine and sweet believing      In dreams which Heaven itself unfurl'd!    What godlike shapes have years bereaving      Swept from this real work-day world!      As once, with tearful passion fired,      The Cyprian Sculptor clasp'd the stone,    Till the cold cheeks, delight-inspired,      Blush'd--to sweet life the marble grown:    So youth's desire for Nature!--round      The Statue so my arms I wreathed,    Till warmth and life in mine it found,      And breath that poets breathe--it breathed;      With my own burning thoughts it burn'd;--      Its silence stirr'd to speech divine;--    Its lips my glowing kiss return'd--      Its heart in beating answer'd mine!    How fair was then the flower--the tree!--      How silver-sweet the fountain's fall!    The soulless had a soul to me!      My life its own life lent to all!      The Universe of things seem'd swelling      The panting heart to burst its bound,    And wandering Fancy found a dwelling      In every shape, thought, deed, and sound.    Germ'd in the mystic buds, reposing,      A whole creation slumbered mute,    Alas, when from the buds unclosing,      How scant and blighted sprung the fruit!      How happy in his dreaming error,      His own gay valor for his wing,    Of not one care as yet in terror      Did Youth upon his journey spring;    Till floods of balm, through air's dominion,      Bore upward to the faintest star--    For never aught to that bright pinion      Could dwell too high, or spread too far.      Though laden with delight, how lightly      The wanderer heavenward still could soar,    And aye the ways of life how brightly      The airy Pageant danced before!    Love, showering gifts (life's sweetest) down,      Fortune, with golden garlands gay,    And Fame, with starbeams for a crown,      And Truth, whose dwelling is the Day.      Ah! midway soon lost evermore,      Afar the blithe companions stray;    In vain their faithless steps explore,      As one by one, they glide away.    Fleet Fortune was the first escaper--      The thirst for wisdom linger'd yet;    But doubts with many a gloomy vapor      The sun-shape of the Truth beset!      The holy crown which Fame was wreathing,      Behold! the mean man's temples wore,    And, but for one short spring-day breathing,      Bloom'd Love--the Beautiful--no more!    And ever stiller yet, and ever      The barren path more lonely lay,    Till scarce from waning Hope could quiver      A glance along the gloomy way.      Who, loving, lingered yet to guide me,      When all her boon companions fled,    Who stands consoling yet beside me,      And follows to the House of Dread?    Thine FRIENDSHIP--thine the hand so tender,      Thine the balm dropping on the wound,    Thy task the load more lightly to render--      O! earliest sought and soonest found!      And Thou, so pleased, with her uniting,      To charm the soul-storm into peace,    Sweet TOIL, in toil itself delighting,      That more it labored, less could cease;    Tho' but by grains thou aid'st the pile      The vast Eternity uprears,    At least thou strik'st from Time the while      Life's debt--the minutes, days and years.[3]           *       *       *       *       *        THE VEILED IMAGE AT SAIS (1795)        A youth, whom wisdom's warm desire had lured    To learn the secret lore of Egypt's priests,    To Sais came. And soon, from step to step    Of upward mystery, swept his rapid soul!    Still ever sped the glorious Hope along,    Nor could the parch'd Impatience halt, appeased    By the calm answer of the Hierophant--    \"What have I, if I have not all,\" he sigh'd;    \"And giv'st thou but the little and the more?    Does thy truth dwindle to the gauge of gold,    A sum that man may smaller or less small    Possess and count--subtract or add to--still?    Is not TRUTH _one_ and indivisible?

It was in the year 863 that the Prince of Moravia, anxious to  introduce Christianity into his country in a form intelligible to his  subjects, addressed himself to the Emperor Michael III for help. Rome  could not provide any suitable missionaries with knowledge of Slavonic  languages, and the German, or more exactly the Bavarian, hierarchy with  which Rome entrusted the spiritual welfare of the Slavs of Moravia and  Pannonia used its greater local knowledge for political and not religious  ends. The Germans exploited their ecclesiastical influence in order  completely to dominate the Slavs politically, and as a result the latter  were only allowed to see the Church through Teutonic glasses.    In answer to this appeal the emperor sent the two brothers Cyril and  Methodius, who were Greeks of Salonika and had considerable knowledge of  Slavonic languages. They composed the Slavonic alphabet which is to-day  used throughout Russia, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Montenegro, and in many  parts of Austria-Hungary and translated the gospels into Slavonic; it is  for this reason that they are regarded with such veneration by all members  of the Eastern Church. Their mission proved the greatest success (it must  be remembered that at this time the various Slavonic tongues were probably  less dissimilar than they are now), and the two brothers were warmly  welcomed in Rome by Pope Adrian II, who formally consented to the use, for  the benefit of the Slavs, of the Slavonic liturgy (a remarkable  concession, confirmed by Pope John VIII). This triumph, however, was  short-lived; St. Cyril died in 869 and St. Methodius in 885; subsequent  Popes, notably Stephen V, were not so benevolent to the Slavonic cause;  the machinations of the German hierarchy (which included, even in those  days, the falsification of documents) were irresistible, and finally the  invasion of the Magyars, in 893, destroyed what was left of the Slavonic  Church in Moravia. The missionary brothers had probably passed through  Bulgaria on their way north in 863, but without halting. Many of their  disciples, driven from the Moravian kingdom by the Germans, came south and  took refuge in Bulgaria in 886, and there carried on in more favourable  circumstances the teachings of their masters. Prince Boris had found it  easier to adopt Christianity himself than to induce all his subjects to do  the same. Even when he had enforced his will on them at the price of  numerous executions of recalcitrant nobles, he found himself only at the  beginning of his difficulties. The Greeks had been glad enough to welcome  Bulgaria into the fold, but they had no wish to set up an independent  Church and hierarchy to rival their own. Boris, on the other hand, though  no doubt full of genuine spiritual ardour, was above all impressed with  the authority and prestige which the basileus derived from the Church of  Constantinople; he also admired the pomp of ecclesiastical ceremony, and  wished to have a patriarch of his own to crown him and a hierarchy of his  own to serve him. Finding the Greeks unresponsive, he turned to Rome, and  Pope Nicholas I sent him two bishops to superintend the ecclesiastical  affairs of Bulgaria till the investiture of Boris at the hands of the Holy  See could be arranged. These bishops set to work with a will, substituted  the Latin for the Greek rite, and brought Bulgaria completely under Roman  influence. But when it was discovered that Boris was aiming at the  erection of an independent Church their enthusiasm abated and they were  recalled to Rome in 867.    Adrian II proved no more sympathetic, and in 870, during the reign of the  Emperor Basil I, it was decided without more ado that the Bulgarian Church  should be directly under the Bishop of Constantinople, on the ground that  the kingdom of Boris was a vassal-state of the basileus, and that from the  Byzantine point of view, as opposed to that of Rome, the State came first  and the Church next. The Moravian Gorazd, a disciple of Methodius, was  appointed Metropolitan, and at his death he was succeeded by his fellow  countryman and co-disciple Clement, who by means of the construction of  numerous churches and monasteries did a great deal for the propagation of  light and learning in Bulgaria. The definite subjection of the Bulgarian  Church to that of Byzantium was an important and far-reaching event. Boris  has been reproached with submitting himself and his country to Greek  influence, but in those days it was either Constantinople or Rome (there  was no third way); and in view of the proximity of Constantinople and the  glamour which its civilization cast all over the Balkans, it is not  surprising that the Greeks carried the day.        6    _The Rise and Fall of the First Bulgarian Empire_, 893-972      During the reign of Simeon, second son of Boris, which lasted from 893 to  927, Bulgaria reached a very high level of power and prosperity. Simeon,  called the Great, is looked on by Bulgarians as their most capable monarch  and his reign as the most brilliant period of their history. He had spent  his childhood at Constantinople and been educated there, and he became  such an admirer of Greek civilization that he was nicknamed _Hemiargos_.  His instructors had done their work so well that Simeon remained  spellbound by the glamour of Constantinople throughout his life, and,  although he might have laid the foundations of a solid empire in the  Balkans, his one ambition was to conquer Byzantium and to be recognized as  basileus--an ambition which was not to be fulfilled. His first campaign  against the Greeks was not very fruitful, because the latter summoned the  Magyars, already settled in Hungary, to their aid and they attacked Simeon  from the north. Simeon in return called the Pechenegs, another fierce  Tartar tribe, to his aid, but this merely resulted in their definite  establishment in Rumania. During the twenty years of peace, which strange  to say filled the middle of his reign (894-913), the internal development  of Bulgaria made great strides. The administration was properly organized,  commerce was encouraged, and agriculture flourished. In the wars against  the Greeks which occupied his last years he was more successful, and  inflicted a severe defeat on them at Anchialo (the modern Ahiolu) in 917;  but he was still unable to get from them what he wanted, and at last, in  921, he was obliged to proclaim himself _basileus_ and _autocrat[=o]r_ of  all Bulgars and Greeks, a title which nobody else recognized. He  reappeared before Constantinople the same year, but effected nothing more  than the customary devastation of the suburbs. The year 923 witnessed a  solemn reconciliation between Rome and Constantinople; the Greeks were  clever enough to prevent the Roman legates visiting Bulgaria on their  return journey, and thereby administered a rebuff to Simeon, who was  anxious to see them and enter into direct relations with Rome. In the same  year Simeon tried to make an alliance with the Arabs, but the ambassadors  of the latter were intercepted by the Greeks, who made it worth their  while not to continue the journey to Bulgaria.    In 924 Simeon determined on a supreme effort against Constantinople and as  a preliminary he ravaged Macedonia and Thrace. When, however, he arrived  before the city the walls and the catapults made him hesitate, and he  entered into negotiations, which, as usual, petered out and brought him no  adequate reward for all his hopes and preparations. In the west his arms  were more successful, and he subjected most of the eastern part of Serbia  to his rule. From all this it can be seen that he was no diplomat, though  not lacking in enterprise and ambition. The fact was that while he made  his kingdom too powerful for the Greeks to subdue (indeed they were  compelled to pay him tribute), yet Constantinople with its impregnable  walls, well-organized army, powerful fleet, and cunning and experienced  statesmen, was too hard a nut for him to crack.    Simeon extended the boundaries of his country considerably, and his  dominion included most of the interior of the Balkan peninsula south of  the Danube and east of the rivers Morava and Ibar in Serbia and of the  Drin in Albania. The Byzantine Church greatly increased its influence in  Bulgaria during his reign, and works of theology grew like mushrooms. This  was the only kind of literature that was ever popular in Bulgaria, and  although it is usual to throw contempt on the literary achievements of  Constantinople, we should know but little of Bulgaria were it not for the  Greek historians.    Simeon died in 927, and his son Peter, who succeeded him, was a lover of  peace and comfort; he married a Byzantine princess, and during his reign  (927-69) Greek influence grew ever stronger, in spite of several revolts  on the part of the Bulgar nobles, while the capital Preslav became a  miniature Constantinople. In 927 Rome recognized the kingdom and  patriarchate of Bulgaria, and Peter was duly crowned by the Papal legate.  This was viewed with disfavour by the Greeks, and they still called Peter  only _arch[=o]n_ or prince (_knyaz_ in Bulgarian), which was the utmost  title allowed to any foreign sovereign. It was not until 945 that they  recognized Peter as _basileus_, the unique title possessed by their own  emperors and till then never granted to any one else. Peter's reign was  one of misfortune for his country both at home and abroad. In 931 the  Serbs broke loose under their leader [)C]aslav, whom Simeon had captured  but who effected his escape, and asserted their independence. In 963 a  formidable revolt under one Shishman undermined the whole state fabric. He  managed to subtract Macedonia and all western Bulgaria, including Sofia  and Vidin, from Peter's rule, and proclaimed himself independent _tsar  (tsar_ "]]]
