The following  questions should then be prepared.    CORN.    What are the parts of the seed?    Compare these parts with the Morning-Glory, Sunflower, Bean, and Pea.    Where is the food stored?    How many cotyledons have Corn, Wheat, and Oats?    How many have Bean, Pea, Morning-Glory, and Sunflower?    Compare the veins of the leaves of each class and see what difference you  can find.    This will bring up the terms dicotyledon and monocotyledon. _Di_ means  two, _mono_ means one. This difference in the veins, netted in the first  class, parallel in the second, is characteristic of the classes. Pupils  should have specimens of leaves to classify under these two heads.  Flowering plants are divided first into these two classes, the  Dicotyledons and the Monocotyledons.    If Pine-seeds can be planted, the polycotyledonous embryo can also be  studied.      7. _Food of seedlings_.--The food of the Wheat seedling may be shown in  fine flour. [1]\"The flour is to be moistened in the hand and kneaded until  it becomes a homogeneous mass. Upon this mass pour some pure water and  wash out all the white powder until nothing is left except a viscid lump  of gluten. This is the part of the crushed wheat-grains which very closely  resembles in its composition the flesh of animals. The white powder washed  away is nearly pure wheat-starch. Of course the other ingredients, such as  the mineral matter and the like, might be referred to, but the starch at  least should be shown. When the seed is placed in proper soil, or upon a  support where it can receive moisture, and can get at the air and still be  warm enough, a part of the starch changes into a sort of gum, like that on  postage stamps, and finally becomes a kind of sugar. Upon this sirup the  young seedling feeds until it has some good green leaves for work, and as  we have seen in the case of some plants it has these very early.\"    [Footnote 1: Concerning a Few Common Plants, page 18.]    The presence of starch can be shown by testing with a solution of iodine.  Starch is turned blue by iodine and may thus be detected in flour, in  seeds, in potatoes, etc.    After all this careful experimental work the subject may be studied in the  text-book and recited, the recitation constituting a thorough review of  the whole.    A charming description of the germination of a seed will be found in the  Reader. V. The Birth of Picciola.    _Gray's Lessons_. Sect. II, 8-14. III. _How Plants Grow_. Sect. I, 22, 23.  II.          III    ROOTS.      This subject can be treated more conveniently while the young seedlings  are still growing, because their roots are very suitable for study. It  seems best, therefore, to take it up before examining the buds.      1. _Study of the Roots of Seedlings_.--One or two of the seedlings should  be broken off and the slips put into a glass of water. They will be  studied later. Bean and Sunflower are the best for the purpose.    Begin by telling the pupils to prepare for their first lesson a  description of the roots of their seedlings. Those grown on sponge or  paper will show the development of the root-hairs, while those grown on  sand are better for studying the form of the root. Give them also some  fleshy root to describe, as a carrot, or a radish; and a spray of English  Ivy, as an example of aerial roots.    Throughout these lessons, the method is pursued of giving pupils specimens  to observe and describe before teaching them botanical terms. It is better  for them to name the things they see than to find examples for terms  already learned. In the first case, they feel the difficulty of expressing  themselves and are glad to have the want of exact terms supplied. This  method is discouraging at first, especially to the younger ones; but,  with time and patience, they will gradually become accustomed to describe  whatever they can see. They have, at any rate, used their eyes; and,  though they may not understand the real meaning of anything they have  seen, they are prepared to discuss the subject intelligently when they  come together in the class. If they will first write out their unassisted  impressions and, subsequently, an account of the same thing after they  have had a recitation upon it, they will be sure to gain something in the  power of observation and clear expression. It cannot be too strongly  urged that the number of facts that the children may learn is not of the  slightest consequence, but that the teacher should aim to cultivate the  quick eye, the ready hand, and the clear reason.    The root of the Morning-Glory is _primary_; it is a direct downward growth  from the tip of the caulicle. It is about as thick as the stem, tapers  towards the end, and has short and fibrous branches. In some plants the  root keeps on growing and makes a _tap-root_; in the Bean, it soon becomes  lost in the branches. These are all simple, that is, there is but one  primary root. Sometimes there are several or many, and the root is then  said to be _multiple_. The Pumpkin is an example of this. The root of  the Pea is described in the older editions of Gray's Lessons as being  multiple, but it is generally simple. Indian Corn, also, usually starts  with a single root, but this does not make a tap-root, and is soon  followed by many others from any part of the caulicle, or even from the  stem above, giving it the appearance of having a multiple root.    The root of the Radish is different from any of these; it is _fleshy_.  Often, it tapers suddenly at the bottom into a root like that of  the Morning-Glory with some fibres upon it. It is, in fact, as the  Morning-Glory would be if the main root were to be thickened up by  food being stored in it. It is a primary tap-root. The radish is  _spindle-shaped_, tapering at top and bottom, the carrot is _conical_, the  turnip is called _napiform_; some radishes are shaped like the turnip.    The aerial roots of the English Ivy answer another purpose than that of  giving nourishment to the plant. They are used to support it in climbing.  These are an example of _secondary_ roots, which are roots springing  laterally from any part of the stem. The Sweet Potato has both fleshy and  fibrous roots and forms secondary roots of both kinds every year.[1] Some  of the seedlings will probably show the root-hairs to the naked eye. These  will be noticed hereafter.    [Footnote 1: Gray's Lessons, p. 35, Fig. 86.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--1. Tap-root. 2. Multiple root of Pumpkin. 3.  Napiform root of Turnip. 4. Spindle-shaped root of Radish. 5. Conical root  of Carrot. 6. Aerial roots of Ivy.]    It is my experience that pupils always like classifying things under  different heads, and it is a good exercise. The following table may be  made of the roots they have studied, adding other examples. Dr. Gray says  that ordinary roots may be roughly classed into fibrous and fleshy.[1]  Thome classes them as woody and fleshy.[2]    [Footnote 1: Gray's Lessons, p. 34.]    [Footnote 2: Text-book of Structural and Physiological Botany.

The teacher can say that this will be explained later.]      2. _Fleshy Roots_.--The scholars are already familiar with the storing  of food for the seedling in or around the cotyledons, and will readily  understand that these roots are storehouses of food for the plant. The  Turnip, Carrot, and Beet are _biennials_; that is, their growth is  continued through two seasons. In the first year, they make a vigorous  growth of leaves alone, and the surplus food is carried to the root in the  form of a syrup, and there stored, having been changed into starch, or  something very similar. At the end of the first season, the root is filled  with food, prepared for the next year, so that the plant can live on its  reserve fund and devote its whole attention to flowering. These roots  are often good food for animals. There are some plants that store their  surplus food in their roots year after year, using up in each season the  store of the former one, and forming new roots continually. The Sweet  Potato is an example of this class. These are _perennials_. The food in  perennials, however, is usually stored in stems, rather than in roots, as  in trees. _Annuals_ are generally fibrous-rooted, and the plant dies after  its first year. The following experiment will serve as an illustration of  the way in which the food stored in fleshy roots is utilized for growth.

If a man could live for ever by reason of his noble  nature--but to none is this lot vouchsafed--he would remain untouched of  death because of his fair fame and his good deeds.\"    The songs furnish ample evidence as to the high position which Abd al  Muttalib held among the Kureisch. His death was a great loss to his  nation, but it was a greater calamity to his little foster-child, for it  brought him from ease and riches to comparative poverty and obscurity  with his uncle, Abu Talib. None of Abd al Muttalib's sons inherited the  nature of their father, and with his death the greatness of the house of  Hashim diminished, until it gave place to the Omeyya branch, with Harb at  its head. The offices at Mecca were seized by the Omeyya, and to the  descendants of Abd al Muttalib there remained but the privilege of caring  for the well Zemzem, and of giving its water for the refreshment of  pilgrims. Only two of his sons, except Abu Talib, who earns renown  chiefly as the guardian of Mahomet, attain anything like prominence.  Hamza was converted at the beginning of Mahomet's mission, and continued  his helper and warrior until he died in battle for Islam; Abu Lahab (the  flame) opposed Mahomet's teaching with a vehemence that earned him one of  the fiercest denunciations in the early, passionate Suras of the  Kuran:      \"Blasted be the hands of Abu Lahab; let himself perish;    His wealth and his gains shall avail him not;    Burned shall he be with the fiery flame,    His wife shall be laden with firewood--    On her neck a rope of palm fibre.\"    Mahomet, bereft a second time of one he loved and on whom he depended,  passed into the care of his uncle, Abu Talib. This was a man of no great  force of character, well-disposed and kindly, but of straitened means,  and lacking in the qualities that secure success. Later, he seems to have  attained a more important position, mainly, one would imagine, through  the lion courage and unfaltering faith in the Prophet of his son, the  mighty warrior Ali, of whom it is written, \"Mahomet is the City of  Knowledge, and Ali is the Gate thereof.\" But although Abu Talib was  sufficiently strong to withstand the popular fury of the Kureisch against  Mahomet, and to protect him for a time on the grounds of kinship, he  never finally decided upon which side he would take his stand. Had he  been a far-seeing, imaginative man, able to calculate even a little the  force that had entered into Arabian polity, the history of the foundation  of Islam would have been continued, with Mecca as its base, and have  probably resolved itself into the war of two factions within the city,  wherein the new faith, being bound to the more powerful political party,  would have had a speedier conquest.    With Abu Talib Mahomet spent the rest of his childhood and youth--quiet  years, except for a journey to Syria, and his insignificant part in the  war against the Hawazin, a desert tribe that engaged the Kureisch for  some time. In Abu Talib's house there was none of the ease that had  surrounded him with Abd al Muttalib. But Mahomet was naturally an  affectionate child, and was equally attached to his uncle as he had been  to his grandfather.    Two years later Abu Talib set out on a mercantile journey, and was minded  to leave his small foster-child behind him, but Mahomet came to him  as he sat on his camel equipped for his journey, and clinging to him  passionately implored his uncle not to go without him. Abu Talib could  not resist his pleading, and so Mahomet accompanied him on that magical  journey through the desert, so glorious yet awesome to an imaginative  child, Bostra was the principal city of exchange for merchandise  circulating between Yemen, Northern Arabia, and the cities of Upper  Palestine, and Mahomet must thus have travelled on the caravan route  through the heart of Syria, past Jerash, Ammon, and the site of the  fated Cities of the Plain. In Syria, too, he first encountered the  Christian faith, and planted those remembrances that were to be revived  and strengthened upon his second journey through that wonderful land--in  religion, and in a lesser degree in polity, a law unto itself, forging  out its own history apart from the main stream of Christian life and  thought.    Legends concerning this journey are rife, and all emphasise the influence  Christianity had upon his mind, and also the ready recognition of his  coming greatness by all those Christians who saw him. On the homeward  journey the monk Bahirah is fabled to have met the party and to have  bidden them to a feast. When he saw the child was not among them he was  wroth, and commanded his guests to bring \"every man of the company.\" He  interrogated Mahomet and Abu Talib concerning the parentage of the boy,  and we have here the first traditional record of Mahomet's speech.    \"Ask what thou wilt,\" he said to Bahirah, \"and I will make answer.\"    So Bahirah questioned him as to the signs that had been vouchsafed him,  and looking between his shoulders found the seal of the prophetic office,  a mole covered with hair. Then Bahirah knew this was he who was foretold,  and counselled Abu Talib to take him to his native land, and to beware  [39] of the Jews, for he would one day attain high honour. At this time  Mahomet was little more than a child, but although few thoughts of God or  of human destiny can have crossed his mind, he retained a vivid  impression of the storied places through which he passed--Jerash, Ammon,  the valley of Hejr, and saw in imagination the mighty stream of the  Tigris, the ruinous cities, and Palmyra with its golden pillars fronting  the sun. The tribes which the caravan encountered were rich in legend and  myth, and their influence, together with the more subtle spell of the  desert vastness, wrought in him that fervour of spirit, a leaping,  troubled flame, which found mortal expression in the poetry of the early  part of the Kuran, where the vision of God's majesty compels the gazer  into speech that sweeps from his mind in a stream of fire:      \"By the Sun and his noonday brightness,    By the Moon when she followeth him,    By Day when it revealeth his glory,    By the night when it enshroudeth him,    By the Heaven and Him who built it,    By the Earth and Him who spread it forth,    By the Soul and Him who balanced it,    Breathed into its good, yea, and its evil--    Verily man's lot is cast amid destruction    Save those who believe and deal justly,    And enjoin upon each other steadfastness and truth.\"          CHAPTER III      STRIFE AND MEDITATION    \"God hath treasuries beneath the throne, the keys whereof are the tongues  of poets.\"--MAHOMET.    The Arabian calendar has always been in a distinctive manner subject to  the religion of the people. Before Mahomet imposed his faith upon Mecca,  there were four sacred months following each other, in which no war might  be waged. For four months, therefore, the tumultuous Arab spirit was  restrained from that most precious to it; pilgrimages to holy places were  undertaken, and there was a little leisure for the cultivation of art and  learning.    The Greater Pilgrimage to Mecca, comprising the sevenfold circuit of the  Kaaba and the kissing of the sacred Black Stone, and culminating in a  procession to the holy places of Mina and Arafat, could only be  undertaken in Dzul-Higg, corresponding in the time of Mahomet to our  March. The month preceding, Dzul-Cada, was occupied in a kind of  preparation and rejoicing, which took the form of a fair at Ocatz, three  days' journey east of Mecca, when representatives of all the surrounding  nations used to assemble to exchange merchandise, to take part in the  games, to listen to the contests in poetry and rhetoric, and sometimes to  be roused into sinister excitement at the proximity of so many tribes  differing from them in nationality, and often in their religion and moral  code.    Into this vast concourse came Mahomet, a lad of fifteen, eager to see,  hear, and know. He was present at the poetic contests, and caught from  the protagonists a reflection of their vivid, fitful eloquence, with its  ceaseless undercurrent of monotony.    Romance, in so far as it represents the love of the strange, is a product  of the West. There is a rigidity in the Eastern mind that does not allow  of much change or seeking after new things. Wild and beautiful as this  poetry of Arabia is, its themes and their manner of treatment seldom  vary; as the desert is changeless in contour, filled with a brilliant  sameness, whirling at times into sombre fury and as suddenly subsiding,  so is the literature which it fostered. The monotony is expressed in a  reiteration of subject, barbarous to the intellect of the West; endurance  is born of that monotony, and strength, and the acquiescence in things as  they are, but not the discovery and development of ideas. Arabia does not  flash forth a new presentment of beauty, following the vivid apprehension  of some lovely form, but broods over it in a kind of slumbering  enthusiasm that mounts at last into a glory of metaphor, drowning the  subject in intensest light. The rival poets assembled to discover who  could turn the deftest phrases in satire of the opposing tribe, or extol  most eloquently the bravery and skill of his own people, the beauty and  modesty of their women, and from these wild outpourings Mahomet learnt to  clothe his thoughts in that splendid garment whose jewels illumine the  earlier part of the Kuran.    Perhaps more important than the poetical contests was the religious  aspect of the fair at Ocatz. Here were gathered Jew, Christian, and  Arabian worshipper of many gods, in a vast hostile confusion. Mahomet was  familiar with Jewish cosmogony"]]]
