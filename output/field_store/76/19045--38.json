Now, as I scrutinized them with  greater intentness, my mind began to reach out to fresh conclusions.  There was something about them, an indescribable sort of silent vitality  that suggested, to my broadening consciousness, a state of  life-in-death--a something that was by no means life, as we understand  it; but rather an inhuman form of existence, that well might be likened  to a deathless trance--a condition in which it was possible to imagine  their continuing, eternally. 'Immortal!' the word rose in my thoughts  unbidden; and, straightway, I grew to wondering whether this might be  the immortality of the gods.    And then, in the midst of my wondering and musing, something happened.  Until then, I had been staying just within the shadow of the exit of the  great rift. Now, without volition on my part, I drifted out of the  semi-darkness and began to move slowly across the arena--toward the  House. At this, I gave up all thoughts of those prodigious Shapes above  me--and could only stare, frightenedly, at the tremendous structure  toward which I was being conveyed so remorselessly. Yet, though I  searched earnestly, I could discover nothing that I had not already  seen, and so became gradually calmer.    Presently, I had reached a point more than halfway between the House  and the gorge. All around was spread the stark loneliness of the place,  and the unbroken silence. Steadily, I neared the great building. Then,  all at once, something caught my vision, something that came 'round one  of the huge buttresses of the House, and so into full view. It was a  gigantic thing, and moved with a curious lope, going almost upright,  after the manner of a man. It was quite unclothed, and had a remarkable  luminous appearance. Yet it was the face that attracted and frightened  me the most. It was the face of a swine.    Silently, intently, I watched this horrible creature, and forgot my  fear, momentarily, in my interest in its movements. It was making its  way, cumbrously 'round the building, stopping as it came to each window  to peer in and shake at the bars, with which--as in this house--they  were protected; and whenever it came to a door, it would push at it,  fingering the fastening stealthily. Evidently, it was searching for an  ingress into the House.    I had come now to within less than a quarter of a mile of the great  structure, and still I was compelled forward. Abruptly, the Thing turned  and gazed hideously in my direction. It opened its mouth, and, for the  first time, the stillness of that abominable place was broken, by a  deep, booming note that sent an added thrill of apprehension through me.  Then, immediately, I became aware that it was coming toward me, swiftly  and silently. In an instant, it had covered half the distance that lay  between. And still, I was borne helplessly to meet it. Only a hundred  yards, and the brutish ferocity of the giant face numbed me with a  feeling of unmitigated horror. I could have screamed, in the supremeness  of my fear; and then, in the very moment of my extremity and despair, I  became conscious that I was looking down upon the arena, from a rapidly  increasing height. I was rising, rising. In an inconceivably short  while, I had reached an altitude of many hundred feet. Beneath me, the  spot that I had just left, was occupied by the foul Swine-creature. It  had gone down on all fours and was snuffing and rooting, like a  veritable hog, at the surface of the arena. A moment and it rose to its  feet, clutching upward, with an expression of desire upon its face such  as I have never seen in this world.    Continually, I mounted higher. A few minutes, it seemed, and I had  risen above the great mountains--floating, alone, afar in the redness.  At a tremendous distance below, the arena showed, dimly; with the mighty  House looking no larger than a tiny spot of green. The Swine-thing was  no longer visible.    Presently, I passed over the mountains, out above the huge breadth of  the plain. Far away, on its surface, in the direction of the ring-shaped  sun, there showed a confused blur. I looked toward it, indifferently. It  reminded me, somewhat, of the first glimpse I had caught of the  mountain-amphitheatre.    With a sense of weariness, I glanced upward at the immense ring of  fire. What a strange thing it was! Then, as I stared, out from the dark  center, there spurted a sudden flare of extraordinary vivid fire.  Compared with the size of the black center, it was as naught; yet, in  itself, stupendous. With awakened interest, I watched it carefully,  noting its strange boiling and glowing. Then, in a moment, the whole  thing grew dim and unreal, and so passed out of sight. Much amazed, I  glanced down to the Plain from which I was still rising. Thus, I  received a fresh surprise. The Plain--everything had vanished, and only  a sea of red mist was spread far below me. Gradually as I stared this  grew remote, and died away into a dim far mystery of red against an  unfathomable night. A while, and even this had gone, and I was wrapped  in an impalpable, lightless gloom.        _IV_    THE EARTH    Thus I was, and only the memory that I had lived through the dark, once  before, served to sustain my thoughts. A great time passed--ages. And  then a single star broke its way through the darkness. It was the first  of one of the outlying clusters of this universe. Presently, it was far  behind, and all about me shone the splendor of the countless stars.  Later, years it seemed, I saw the sun, a clot of flame. Around it, I  made out presently several remote specks of light--the planets of the  Solar system. And so I saw the earth again, blue and unbelievably  minute. It grew larger, and became defined.    A long space of time came and went, and then at last I entered into the  shadow of the world--plunging headlong into the dim and holy earth  night. Overhead were the old constellations, and there was a crescent  moon. Then, as I neared the earth's surface, a dimness swept over me,  and I appeared to sink into a black mist.    For a while, I knew nothing. I was unconscious. Gradually, I became  aware of a faint, distant whining. It became plainer. A desperate  feeling of agony possessed me. I struggled madly for breath, and tried  to shout. A moment, and I got my breath more easily. I was conscious  that something was licking my hand. Something damp swept across my face.  I heard a panting, and then again the whining. It seemed to come to my  ears, now, with a sense of familiarity, and I opened my eyes. All was  dark; but the feeling of oppression had left me. I was seated, and  something was whining piteously, and licking me. I felt strangely  confused, and, instinctively, tried to ward off the thing that licked.  My head was curiously vacant, and, for the moment, I seemed incapable of  action or thought. Then, things came back to me, and I called 'Pepper,'  faintly. I was answered by a joyful bark, and renewed and  frantic caresses.    In a little while, I felt stronger, and put out my hand for the  matches. I groped about, for a few moments, blindly; then my hands lit  upon them, and I struck a light, and looked confusedly around. All about  me, I saw the old, familiar things. And there I sat, full of dazed  wonders, until the flame of the match burnt my finger, and I dropped it;  while a hasty expression of pain and anger, escaped my lips, surprising  me with the sound of my own voice.    After a moment, I struck another match, and, stumbling across the room,  lit the candles. As I did so, I observed that they had not burned away,  but had been put out.    As the flames shot up, I turned, and stared about the study; yet there  was nothing unusual to see; and, suddenly, a gust of irritation took me.  What had happened? I held my head, with both hands, and tried to  remember. Ah! the great, silent Plain, and the ring-shaped sun of red  fire. Where were they? Where had I seen them? How long ago? I felt dazed  and muddled. Once or twice, I walked up and down the room, unsteadily.  My memory seemed dulled, and, already, the thing I had witnessed came  back to me with an effort.    I have a remembrance of cursing, peevishly, in my bewilderment.  Suddenly, I turned faint and giddy, and had to grasp at the table for  support. During a few moments, I held on, weakly; and then managed to  totter sideways into a chair. After a little time, I felt somewhat  better, and succeeded in reaching the cupboard where, usually, I keep  brandy and biscuits. I poured myself out a little of the stimulant, and  drank it off. Then, taking a handful of biscuits, I returned to my  chair, and began to devour them, ravenously. I was vaguely surprised at  my hunger. I felt as though I had eaten nothing for an uncountably  long while.    As I ate, my glance roved about the room, taking in its various  details, and still searching, though almost unconsciously, for something  tangible upon which to take hold, among the invisible mysteries that  encompassed me. 'Surely,' I thought, 'there must be something--' And, in  the same instant, my gaze dwelt upon the face of the clock in the  opposite corner. Therewith, I stopped eating, and just stared. For,  though its ticking indicated most certainly that it was still going, the  hands were pointing to a little _before_ the hour of midnight; whereas  it was, as well I knew, considerably _after_ that time when I had  witnessed the first of the strange happenings I have just described.    For perhaps a moment I was astounded and puzzled. Had the hour been the  same as when I had last seen the clock, I should have concluded that the  hands had stuck in one place, while the internal mechanism went on as  usual; but that would, in no way, account for the hands having traveled  backward.
