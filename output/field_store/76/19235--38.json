When the merest trifles that a man throws off are inordinately  praised, he soon becomes content with producing the merest trifles.  Longfellow has grown unaccustomed to do himself justice. Half his  volumes are filled up with translations; graceful and accurate,  indeed; but translations, and often from originals of very moderate  merit. His last original poem, _Evangeline_, is a sort of pastoral  in hexameters. The resuscitation of this classical metre had a queer  effect upon the American quidnuncs. Some of the _critics_ evidently  believed it to be a bran-new metre invented for the nonce by the  author, a delusion which they of the 'Mutual Admiration' rather winked  at; and the parodists who endeavored to ridicule the new measure were  evidently not quite sure whether seven feet or nine made a hexameter.  It is really to be regretted that Longfellow has been cajoled into  playing these tricks with himself, for his earlier pieces were works  of much promise, and, had they been worthily followed out, might  have entitled him to a high place among the poets of the language....  Longfellow's poetry, whenever he really lays himself out to write  poetry, has a definite idea and purpose in it--no small merit  now-a-days. His versification is generally harmonious, and he displays  a fair command of metre. Sometimes he takes a fancy to an obsolete  or out-of-the-way stanza; one of his longest and best poems, _The  Skeleton in Armor_, is exactly in the measure of Drayton's fine  ballad on Agincourt. His chief fault is an over-fondness for simile  and metaphor. He seems to think indispensable the introduction into  everything he writes of a certain (or sometimes a very uncertain)  number of these figures. Accordingly his poems are crowded with  comparisons, sometimes very pretty and pleasing, at others so  far-fetched that the string of tortured images which lead off Alfred  de Musset's bizarre _Ode to the Moon_ can hardly equal them. This  _making figures_ (whether from any connection with the calculating  habits of the people or not) is a terrible propensity of American  writers, whether of prose or verse. Their orators are especial sinners  in this respect. We have seen speeches stuck as full of metaphors  (more or less mixed) as Burton's _Anatomy_ is of quotations.    \"Such persons as know from experience that literary people are not  always in private life what their writings would betoken, that  Miss Bunions do not precisely resemble March violets, and mourners  upon paper may be laughers over mahogany--such persons will not be  surprised to hear that the Longfellow is a very jolly fellow, a lover  of fun and good dinners, and of an amiability and personal popularity  that have aided not a little the popularity of his writings in  verse and prose--for he writes prose too, prettier, quainter, more  figurative, and more poetic if anything, than his poetry. He is also a  professor at Harvard College, near Boston.    \"EDGAR A. POE, like Longfellow and most of the other American poets,  wrote prose as well as poetry, having produced a number of wild,  grotesque, and powerfully-imagined tales; unlike most of them he was  a literary man _pur sang_. He depended for support entirely on his  writings, and his career was more like the precarious existence of  an author in the time of Johnson and Savage than the decent life of  an author in our own day. He was a Southerner by birth, acquired a  liberal education, and what the French call 'expansive' tastes, was  adopted by a rich relative, quarreled with him, married 'for love,'  and lived by editing magazines in Richmond, Philadelphia, and New  York; by delivering lectures (the never-failing last resort of the  American literary adventurer); by the occasional subscriptions of  compassionate acquaintances or admiring friends--any way he could--for  eighteen or nineteen years: lost his wife, involved himself in endless  difficulties, and finally died in what should have been the prime of  his life, about six months ago. His enemies attributed his untimely  death to intemperance; his writings would rather lead to the belief  that he was an habitual taker of opium. If it make a man a poet to be      Dowered with the hate of hate, the scorn of scorn,    The love of love,    Poe was certainly a poet. Virulently and ceaselessly abused by his  enemies (who included a large portion of the press), he was worshiped  to infatuation by his friends. The severity of his editorial  criticisms, and the erratic course of his life, fully account for the  former circumstance; the latter is probably to be attributed, in part  at least, to pity for his mishaps.    \"If Longfellow's poetry is best designated as quaint, Poe's may most  properly be characterized as fantastic. The best of it reminds one  of Tennyson, not by any direct imitation of particular passages, but  by its general air and tone. But he was very far from possessing  Tennyson's fine ear for melody. His skill in versification, sometimes  striking enough, was evidently artificial; he overstudied metrical  expression and overrated its value so as sometimes to write, what  were little better than nonsense-verses, for the rhythm. He had an  incurable propensity for refrains, and when he had once caught a  harmonious cadence, appeared to think it could not be too often  repeated. Poe's name is usually mentioned in connection with _The  Raven_, a poem which he published about five years ago. It had an  immense run, and gave rise to innumerable parodies--those tests of  notoriety if not of merit. And certainly it is not without a peculiar  and fantastic excellence in the execution, while the conception is  highly striking and poetic. This much notice seems due to a poem which  created such a sensation in the author's country. To us it seems by  no means the best of Poe's productions; we much prefer, for instance,  this touching allegory, which was originally embodied in one of his  wildest tales, _The Haunted Palace_. In the very same volume with this  are some verses that Poe wrote when a boy, and some that a boy might  be ashamed of writing. Indeed the secret of rejection seems to be  little known to Transatlantic bards. The rigidness of self-criticism  which led Tennyson to ignore and annihilate, so far as in him lay,  full one half of his earlier productions, would hardly be understood  by them. This is particularly unlucky in the case of Poe, whose rhymes  sometimes run fairly away with him, till no purpose or meaning is  traceable amid a jingle of uncommon and fine-sounding words....    \"Though Poe was a Southerner, his poetry has nothing in it suggestive  of his peculiar locality. It is somewhat remarkable that the  slave-holding, which has tried almost all other means of excusing or  justifying itself before the world, did not think of 'keeping a poet,'  and engaging the destitute author from its own territory to sing the  praises of 'the patriarchal institution.' And it would have been  a fair provocation that the Abolitionists had their poet already.  Indeed several of the northern poets have touched upon this subject;  Longfellow, in particular, has published a series of spirited  and touching anti-slavery poems; but the man who has made it his  _specialite_ is JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER, a Quaker, literary editor of  the _National Era_, an Abolition and ultra-Radical paper, which, in  manful despite of Judge Lynch, is published at Washington, between the  slave-pens and the capitol. His verses are certainly obnoxious to the  jurisdiction of that notorious popular potentate, being unquestionably  'inflammatory, incendiary, and insurrectionary,' as the Southern  formula goes, in a very high degree. He makes passionate appeals to  the Puritan spirit of New England, and calls on her sons to utter  their voice,      ... From all her wild green mountains,      From valleys where her slumbering fathers lie,    From her blue rivers and her welling fountains,          And clear cold sky--    From her rough coast, and isles, which hungry Ocean      Gnaws with his surges--from the fisher's skiff,    With white sails swaying to the billow's motion          Round rock and cliff--    From the free fireside of her unbought farmer,      From her free laborer at his loom and wheel.    From the brown smithy where, beneath the hammer,          Rings the red steel--    From each and all, if God hath not forsaken      Our land and left us to an evil choice;--    \"and protest against the shocking anomaly of slavery in a free  country. At times, when deploring the death of some fellow laborer in  the cause, he falls into a somewhat subdued strain, though even then  there is more of spirit and fire in his verses than one naturally  expects from a follower of George Fox; but on such occasions he  displays a more careful and harmonious versification than is his  wont. There is no scarcity of these elegies in his little volume,  the _Abolitionists_, even when they escape the attentions of the  high legal functionary already alluded to, not being apparently a  long-lived class.    \"_Toujours perdrix_ palls in poetry as in cookery; we grow tired after  awhile of invectives against governors of slave-states and mercenary  persons, and dirges for untimely perished Abolitionists. The wish  suggests itself that Whittier would not always        'Give up to a party what is meant for mankind,'    but sometimes turn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13647"],[0,"Nonsense Songs (#5)"],[1,"tely, there happened to pass by at  that moment an elderly Rhinoceros, on which they seized; and, all four  mounting on his back,--the Quangle-Wangle sitting on his horn, and holding  on by his ears, and the Pussy-Cat swinging at the end of his tail,--they  set off, having only four small beans and three pounds of mashed potatoes  to last through their whole journey.    [Illustration]    They were, however, able to catch numbers of the chickens and turkeys and  other birds who incessantly alighted on the head of the Rhinoceros for the  purpose of gathering the seeds of the rhododendron-plants which grew  there; and these creatures they cooked in the most translucent and  satisfactory manner by means of a fire lighted on the end of the  Rhinoceros's back. A crowd of Kangaroos and gigantic Cranes accompanied  them, from feelings of curiosity and complacency; so that they were never  at a loss for company, and went onward, as it were, in a sort of profuse  and triumphant procession.    Thus in less than eighteen weeks they all arrived safely at home, where  they were received by their admiring relatives with joy tempered with  contempt, and where they finally resolved to carry out the rest of their  travelling-plans at some more favorable opportunity.    As for the Rhinoceros, in token of their grateful adherence, they had him  killed and stuffed directly, and then set him up outside the door of their  father's house as a diaphanous doorscraper.    [Illustration]          THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES OF  THE LAKE PIPPLE-POPPLE.      CHAPTER I.    INTRODUCTORY.    In former days,--that is to say, once upon a time,--there lived in the Land  of Gramble-Blamble seven families. They lived by the side of the great Lake  Pipple-Popple (one of the seven families, indeed, lived _in_ the lake), and  on the outskirts of the city of Tosh, which, excepting when it was quite  dark, they could see plainly. The names of all these places you have  probably heard of; and you have only not to look in your geography-books to  find out all about them.    Now, the seven families who lived on the borders of the great Lake  Pipple-Popple were as follows in the next chapter.      CHAPTER II.    THE SEVEN FAMILIES.    There was a family of two old Parrots and seven young Parrots.    [Illustration]    There was a family of two old Storks and seven young Storks.    [Illustration]    There was a family of two old Geese and seven young Geese.    [Illustration]    There was a family of two old Owls and seven young Owls.    [Illustration]    There was a family of two old Guinea Pigs and seven young Guinea Pigs.    [Illustration]    There was a family of two old Cats and seven young Cats.    [Illustration]    And there was a family of two old Fishes and seven young Fishes.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER III.    THE HABITS OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES.    The Parrots lived upon the Soffsky-Poffsky trees, which were beautiful to  behold, and covered with blue leaves; and they fed upon fruit, artichokes,  and striped beetles.    The Storks walked in and out of the Lake Pipple-Popple, and ate frogs for  breakfast, and buttered toast for tea; but on account of the extreme length  of their legs they could not sit down, and so they walked about  continually.    The Geese, having webs to their feet, caught quantities of flies, which  they ate for dinner.    The Owls anxiously looked after mice, which they caught, and made into  sago-puddings.    The Guinea Pigs toddled about the gardens, and ate lettuces and Cheshire  cheese.    The Cats sate still in the sunshine, and fed upon sponge biscuits.    The Fishes lived in the lake, and fed chiefly on boiled periwinkles.    And all these seven families lived together in the utmost fun and felicity.      CHAPTER IV.    THE CHILDREN OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES ARE SENT AWAY.    One day all the seven fathers and the seven mothers of the seven families  agreed that they would send their children out to see the world.    So they called them all together, and gave them each eight shillings and  some good advice, some chocolate-drops, and a small green morocco  pocket-book to set down their expenses in.    They then particularly entreated them not to quarrel; and all the parents  sent off their children with a parting injunction.    \"If,\" said the old Parrots, \"you find a cherry, do not fight about who  should have it.\"    \"And,\" said the old Storks, \"if you find a frog, divide it carefully into  seven bits, but on no account quarrel about it.\"    And the old Geese said to the seven young Geese, \"Whatever you do, be sure  you do not touch a plum-pudding flea.\"    And the old Owls said, \"If you find a mouse, tear him up into seven slices,  and eat him cheerfully, but without quarrelling.\"    And the old Guinea Pigs said, \"Have a care that you eat your lettuces,  should you find any, not greedily, but calmly.\"    And the old Cats said, \"Be particularly careful not to meddle with a  clangle-wangle if you should see one.\"    And the old Fishes said, \"Above all things, avoid eating a blue boss-woss;  for they do not agree with fishes, and give them a pain in their toes.\"    So all the children of each family thanked their parents; and, making in  all forty-nine polite bows, they went into the wide world.        CHAPTER V.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG PARROTS.    The seven young Parrots had not gone far, when they saw a tree with a  single cherry on it, which the oldest Parrot picked instantly; but the  other six, being extremely hungry, tried to get it also. On which all the  seven began to fight; and they  scuffled,       and huffled,         and ruffled,           and shuffled,             and puffled,               and muffled,                 and buffled,                   and duffled,                     and fluffled,                       and guffled,                         and bruffled,                           and screamed, and shrieked, and squealed,  and squeaked, and clawed, and snapped, and bit, and bumped, and thumped,  and dumped, and flumped each other, till they were all torn into little  bits; and at last there was nothing left to record this painful incident  except the cherry and seven small green feathers.    And that was the vicious and voluble end of the seven young Parrots.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER VI.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG STORKS.    When the seven young Storks set out, they walked or flew for fourteen weeks  in a straight line, and for six weeks more in a crooked one; and after that  they ran as hard as they could for one hundred and eight miles; and after  that they stood still, and made a himmeltanious chatter-clatter-blattery  noise with their bills.    About the same time they perceived a large frog, spotted with green, and  with a sky-blue stripe under each ear.    So, being hungry, they immediately flew at him, and were going to divide  him into seven pieces, when they began to quarrel as to which of his legs  should be taken off first. One said this, and another said that; and while  they were all quarrelling, the frog hopped away. And when they saw that he  was gone, they began to    chatter-clatter,        blatter-platter,            patter-blatter,                matter-clatter,                    flatter-quatter,  more violently than ever; and after they  had fought for a week, they pecked each other all to little pieces, so that  at last nothing was left of any of them except their bills.    And that was the end of the seven young Storks.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER VII.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG GEESE.    When the seven young Geese began to travel, they went over a large plain,  on which there was but one tree, and that was, a very bad one.    So four of them went up to the top of it, and looked about them; while the  other three waddled up and down, and repeated poetry, and their last six  lessons in arithmetic, geography, and cookery.    Presently they perceived, a long way off, an object of the most interesting  and obese appearance, having a perfectly round body exactly resembling a  boiled plum-pudding, with two little wings, and a beak, and three feathers  growing out of his head, and only one leg.    So, after a time, all the seven young Geese said to each other, \"Beyond all  doubt this beast must be a Plum-pudding Flea!\"    On which they incautiously began to sing aloud,           \"Plum-pudding Flea,          Plum-pudding Flea,          Wherever you be,          Oh! come to our tree,      And listen, oh! listen, oh! listen to me!\"    And no sooner had they sung this verse than the Plum-pudding Flea began to  hop and skip on his one leg with the most dreadful velocity, and came  straight to the tree, where he stopped, and looked about him in a vacant  and voluminous manner.    On which the seven young Geese were greatly alarmed, and all of a  tremble-bemble: so one of them put out his long neck, and just touched him  with the tip of his bill; but no sooner had he done this than the  Plum-pudding Flea skipped and hopped about more and more, and higher and  higher; after which he opened his mouth, and, to the great surprise and  indignation of the seven Geese, began to bark so loudly and furiously and  terribly, that they were totally unable to bear the noise; and by degrees  every one of them suddenly tumbled down quite dead.    So that was the end of the seven young Geese.    [Illustration]      CHAPTER VIII.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG OWLS.    When the seven young Owls set out, they sate every now and then on the  branches of old trees, and never went far at one time.    And one night, when it was quite dark, they thought they heard a mouse;  but, as the gas-lamps were not lighted, they could not see him.    So they called out, \"Is that a mouse?\"    On which a mouse answered, \"Squeaky-peeky-weeky! yes, it is!\"    And immediately all the young Owls threw themselves off the tree, meaning  to alight on the ground; but they did not perceive"]]]
