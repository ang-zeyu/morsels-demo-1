Probably not a quarter of an hour  had elapsed when Duane heard the clear reports of a Winchester rifle,  the clatter of rapid hoof-beats, and yells unmistakably the kind to mean  danger for a man like Stevens. Duane mounted and rode to the edge of the  mesquites.    He saw a cloud of dust down the road and a bay horse running fast.  Stevens apparently had not been wounded by any of the shots, for he had  a steady seat in his saddle and his riding, even at that moment, struck  Duane as admirable. He carried a large pack over the pommel, and he kept  looking back. The shots had ceased, but the yells increased. Duane saw  several men running and waving their arms. Then he spurred his horse and  got into a swift stride, so Stevens would not pass him. Presently the  outlaw caught up with him. Stevens was grinning, but there was now no  fun in the dancing eyes. It was a devil that danced in them. His face  seemed a shade paler.    \"Was jest comin' out of the store,\" yelled Stevens. \"Run plumb into a  rancher--who knowed me. He opened up with a rifle. Think they'll chase  us.\"    They covered several miles before there were any signs of pursuit, and  when horsemen did move into sight out of the cottonwoods Duane and his  companion steadily drew farther away.    \"No hosses in thet bunch to worry us,\" called out Stevens.    Duane had the same conviction, and he did not look back again. He rode  somewhat to the fore, and was constantly aware of the rapid thudding of  hoofs behind, as Stevens kept close to him. At sunset they reached the  willow brakes and the river. Duane's horse was winded and lashed with  sweat and lather. It was not until the crossing had been accomplished  that Duane halted to rest his animal. Stevens was riding up the low,  sandy bank. He reeled in the saddle. With an exclamation of surprise  Duane leaped off and ran to the outlaw's side.    Stevens was pale, and his face bore beads of sweat. The whole front of  his shirt was soaked with blood.    \"You're shot!\" cried Duane.    \"Wal, who 'n hell said I wasn't? Would you mind givin' me a lift--on  this here pack?\"    Duane lifted the heavy pack down and then helped Stevens to dismount.  The outlaw had a bloody foam on his lips, and he was spitting blood.    \"Oh, why didn't you say so!\" cried Duane. \"I never thought. You seemed  all right.\"    \"Wal, Luke Stevens may be as gabby as an old woman, but sometimes he  doesn't say anythin'. It wouldn't have done no good.\"    Duane bade him sit down, removed his shirt, and washed the blood from  his breast and back. Stevens had been shot in the breast, fairly low  down, and the bullet had gone clear through him. His ride, holding  himself and that heavy pack in the saddle, had been a feat little short  of marvelous. Duane did not see how it had been possible, and he felt no  hope for the outlaw. But he plugged the wounds and bound them tightly.    \"Feller's name was Brown,\" Stevens said. \"Me an' him fell out over a  hoss I stole from him over in Huntsville. We had a shootin'-scrape then.  Wal, as I was straddlin' my hoss back there in Mercer I seen this Brown,  an' seen him before he seen me. Could have killed him, too. But I wasn't  breakin' my word to you. I kind of hoped he wouldn't spot me. But he  did--an' fust shot he got me here. What do you think of this hole?\"    \"It's pretty bad,\" replied Duane; and he could not look the cheerful  outlaw in the eyes.    \"I reckon it is. Wal, I've had some bad wounds I lived over. Guess mebbe  I can stand this one. Now, Buck, get me some place in the brakes, leave  me some grub an' water at my hand, an' then you clear out.\"    \"Leave you here alone?\" asked Duane, sharply.    \"Shore. You see, I can't keep up with you. Brown an' his friends will  foller us across the river a ways. You've got to think of number one in  this game.\"    \"What would you do in my case?\" asked Duane, curiously.    \"Wal, I reckon I'd clear out an' save my hide,\" replied Stevens.    Duane felt inclined to doubt the outlaw's assertion. For his own part he  decided his conduct without further speech. First he watered the horses,  filled canteens and water bag, and then tied the pack upon his own  horse. That done, he lifted Stevens upon his horse, and, holding him in  the saddle, turned into the brakes, being careful to pick out hard or  grassy ground that left little signs of tracks. Just about dark he ran  across a trail that Stevens said was a good one to take into the wild  country.    \"Reckon we'd better keep right on in the dark--till I drop,\" concluded  Stevens, with a laugh.    All that night Duane, gloomy and thoughtful, attentive to the wounded  outlaw, walked the trail and never halted till daybreak. He was tired  then and very hungry. Stevens seemed in bad shape, although he was still  spirited and cheerful. Duane made camp. The outlaw refused food, but  asked for both whisky and water. Then he stretched out.    \"Buck, will you take off my boots?\" he asked, with a faint smile on his  pallid face.    Duane removed them, wondering if the outlaw had the thought that he did  not want to die with his boots on. Stevens seemed to read his mind.    \"Buck, my old daddy used to say thet I was born to be hanged. But I  wasn't--an' dyin' with your boots on is the next wust way to croak.\"    \"You've a chance to-to get over this,\" said Duane.    \"Shore. But I want to be correct about the boots--an' say, pard, if I do  go over, jest you remember thet I was appreciatin' of your kindness.\"    Then he closed his eyes and seemed to sleep.    Duane could not find water for the horses, but there was an abundance  of dew-wet grass upon which he hobbled them. After that was done he  prepared himself a much-needed meal. The sun was getting warm when he  lay down to sleep, and when he awoke it was sinking in the west. Stevens  was still alive, for he breathed heavily. The horses were in sight. All  was quiet except the hum of insects in the brush. Duane listened awhile,  then rose and went for the horses.    When he returned with them he found Stevens awake, bright-eyed, cheerful  as usual, and apparently stronger.    \"Wal, Buck, I'm still with you an' good fer another night's ride,\" he  said. \"Guess about all I need now is a big pull on thet bottle. Help  me, will you? There! thet was bully. I ain't swallowin' my blood this  evenin'. Mebbe I've bled all there was in me.\"    While Duane got a hurried meal for himself, packed up the little outfit,  and saddled the horses Stevens kept on talking. He seemed to be in a  hurry to tell Duane all about the country. Another night ride would put  them beyond fear of pursuit, within striking distance of the Rio Grande  and the hiding-places of the outlaws.    When it came time for mounting the horses Stevens said, \"Reckon you  can pull on my boots once more.\" In spite of the laugh accompanying the  words Duane detected a subtle change in the outlaw's spirit.    On this night travel was facilitated by the fact that the trail was  broad enough for two horses abreast, enabling Duane to ride while  upholding Stevens in the saddle.    The difficulty most persistent was in keeping the horses in a walk. They  were used to a trot, and that kind of gait would not do for Stevens.  The red died out of the west; a pale afterglow prevailed for a while;  darkness set in; then the broad expanse of blue darkened and the stars  brightened. After a while Stevens ceased talking and drooped in his  saddle. Duane kept the horses going, however, and the slow hours wore  away. Duane thought the quiet night would never break to dawn, that  there was no end to the melancholy, brooding plain. But at length a  grayness blotted out the stars and mantled the level of mesquite and  cactus.    Dawn caught the fugitives at a green camping-site on the bank of a rocky  little stream. Stevens fell a dead weight into Duane's arms, and one  look at the haggard face showed Duane that the outlaw had taken his last  ride. He knew it, too. Yet that cheerfulness prevailed.    \"Buck, my feet are orful tired packin' them heavy boots,\" he said, and  seemed immensely relieved when Duane had removed them.    This matter of the outlaw's boots was strange, Duane thought. He made  Stevens as comfortable as possible, then attended to his own needs. And  the outlaw took up the thread of his conversation where he had left off  the night before.    \"This trail splits up a ways from here, an' every branch of it leads  to a hole where you'll find men--a few, mebbe, like yourself--some like  me--an' gangs of no-good hoss-thieves, rustlers, an' such. It's easy  livin', Buck. I reckon, though, that you'll not find it easy. You'll  never mix in. You'll be a lone wolf. I seen that right off. Wal, if  a man can stand the loneliness, an' if he's quick on the draw, mebbe  lone-wolfin' it is the best. Shore I don't know. But these fellers in  here will be suspicious of a man who goes it alone. If they get a chance  they'll kill you.\"    Stevens asked for water several times. He had forgotten or he did not  want the whisky. His voice grew perceptibly weaker.    \"Be quiet,\" said Duane. \"Talking uses up your strength.\"    \"Aw, I'll talk till--I'm done,\" he replied, doggedly. \"See here, pard,  you can gamble on what I'm tellin' you. An' it'll be useful. From this  camp we'll--you'll meet men right along. An' none of them will be honest  men. All the same, some are better'n others. I've lived along the river  fer twelve years. There's three big gangs of outlaws. King Fisher--you  know him, I reckon, fer he's half the time livin' among respectable  folks. King is a pretty good feller. It'll do to tie up with him ant his  gang. Now, there's Cheseldine, who hangs out in the Rim Rock way up  the river. He's an outlaw chief. I never seen him, though I stayed once  right in his camp. Late years he's got rich an' keeps back pretty well  hid. But Bland--I knowed Bland fer years. An' I haven't any use fer him.

Bob was passionately eager for what he called \"regular schooling,\" that  is the steady discipline of fixed lessons, the companionship of boys of  his own age, and the give and take of the average large, busy school.  Normal life of any kind was out of the question in the poorhouse where he  had spent the first ten years of his life, and after that he had not seen  the inside of a schoolroom. He had read whatever books he could pick up  while at Bramble Farm, and in the knowledge of current events was  remarkably well-posted, thanks to his steady assimilation of newspapers  and magazines since leaving the Peabody roof. But he feared, and with  some foundation, that he might be found deplorably lacking in the most  rudimentary branches.    Betty, of course, had gone to school regularly until her mother's  death. In the year that had elapsed she had thought little of  lessons, and though she did not realize it, she had lost to a great  extent the power of application. Systematic study of any kind might  easily prove a hardship for the active Betty. Still she was eager to  study again, perhaps prepare for college. More than anything else she  craved girl friends.    \"Let's go in for lunch at the first call,\" suggested Betty presently. \"I  didn't eat much breakfast, and I don't believe you did either.\"    \"I swallowed a cup of boiling coffee,\" admitted Bob, \"but that's all I  remember. So I'm ready when you are.\"    Seated at a table well toward the center of the car, Betty's attention  was attracted to a girl who sat facing her. She was not a pretty girl.  She looked discontented and peevish, and the manner in which she  addressed the waiter indicated that she felt under no obligation to  disguise her feelings.    \"Take that back,\" she ordered, pointing a beautifully manicured hand at  a dish just placed before her. \"If you can't bring me a poached egg  that isn't raw, don't bother at all. And I hope you don't intend to  call this cream?\"    Bob glanced swiftly over at the table. The girl consciously tucked back a  lock of stringy hair, displaying the flash of several diamonds.    \"Sweet disposition, hasn't she?\" muttered Bob under his breath. \"I'd like  to see her board just one week with Mr. Peabody.\"    \"Don't--she'll hear you,\" protested Betty. \"I wonder if she is all alone?  What lovely clothes she has! And did you see her rings?\"    \"Well, she'll need 'em, if she's going to snap at everybody,\" said Bob  severely. \"Diamonds help out a cross tongue when a poor waiter is  thinking of his tip.\"    The girl was still finding fault with her food when Betty and Bob rose to  leave the car, and when they passed her table she stared at them with  languid insolence, half closing her narrow hazel eyes.    \"Wow, she's bored completely,\" snickered Bob, when they were out of  earshot. \"I don't believe she's a day older than you are, Betty, and she  is dressed up like a little Christmas tree.\"    \"I think her clothes are wonderful,\" said Betty. \"I wish I had a lace  vestee and some long white gloves. Don't you think they're pretty, Bob?\"    \"No, I think they're silly,\" retorted Bob. \"You wouldn't catch Bobby  Littell going traveling in a party dress and wearing all the family  jewels. Huh, here comes the conductor--wonder what he wants.\"    The conductor, it developed, was shifting passengers from the car behind  the one in which Bob and Betty had seats. It was to be dropped at the  next junction and the few passengers remaining were to be accommodated in  this coach.    \"You're all right, don't have to make any change,\" said the official  kindly, after examining their tickets. \"I'll tell the porter you go  through to Chicago.\"    The car had been fairly well crowded before, and the extra influx taxed  every available seat. Betty took out her crocheting and Bob decided that  he would go in search of a shoe-shine.    \"I'll come back and get you and we'll go out on the observation  platform,\" he said contentedly.    \"Chain six, double crochet--into the ring--\" Betty murmured her  directions half aloud.    \"Right here, Ma'am?\" The porter's voice aroused her.    There in the aisle stood the girl she had noticed in the diner, and with  her was a harassed looking porter carrying three heavy bags.    \"Perhaps you would just as lief take the aisle seat?\" said the girl,  surveying Betty as a princess might gaze upon an annoying little page. \"I  travel better when I can have plenty of fresh air.\"    \"You might have thought I was a bug,\" Betty confided later to Bob.    The diamonds flashed as the girl loosened the fur collar at her throat.    \"Please move over,\" she commanded calmly.    Betty was bewildered, but her innate courtesy died hard.    \"You--you've made a mistake,\" she faltered. \"This seat is taken.\"    \"The conductor said to take any vacant seat,\" said the newcomer. \"You  can't hold seats in a public conveyance--my father says so. Put the bags  in here, porter. Be careful of that enamel leather.\"    To Betty's dismay, she settled herself, flounces and furs and bags, in  the narrow space that belonged to Bob, and by an adroit pressure of her  elbow made it impossible for Betty to resume her crocheting.    \"I think you done made a mistake, lady,\" ventured the porter. \"This seat  belongs to a young man what has a ticket to Chicago.\"    \"Well, I'm going to Chicago,\" answered the girl composedly. \"Do you  expect me to stand up the rest of the way? The agent had no business to  sell me a reservation in a car that only went as far as the Junction.\"    The porter withdrew, shaking his head, and in a few minutes Bob came back  to his seat. Betty, watching the girl, saw her glance sidewise at him  from her narrow eyes, though she pretended to be absorbed in a magazine.    \"I beg your pardon,\" said Bob politely.    There was no response.    \"Pardon me, but you've made a mistake,\" began Bob again. \"You are in the  wrong seat.\"    The magazine came down with a crash and the girl's face, distorted with  rage, appeared in its place.    \"Well, if I am, what are you going to do about it?\" she shrilled rudely.          CHAPTER VI    FINE FEATHERS      Betty Gordon had always, foolishly perhaps, associated courtesy and  good-breeding with beautiful clothes. This strange girl, who could speak  so on such slight provocation (none at all, to be exact) wore a handsome  suit, and if her jewelry was too conspicuous it had the merit of being  genuine. Betty herself had a lively temper, but she was altogether free  from snappishness and when she \"blew up\" the cause was sure to be  unmistakable and significant.    Bob jumped when the girl fired her question at him. There had been  nothing in his limited experience with girls to prepare him for such an  outburst. Betty half expected him to acquiesce and leave the stranger in  possession of his seat, but to her surprise he simply turned on his heel  and walked away. Not, however, before Betty had seen something bordering  on contempt in his eyes.    \"I'd hate to have Bob look at me like that,\" she thought. \"It wasn't as  if he didn't like her, or was mad at her--what is it I am trying to  say? Bob looked as if--as if--Oh, bother, I know what I mean, but I  can't say it.\"    The little spitfire in the seat beside her wriggled uneasily as if she,  too, were not as comfortable as she would pretend. Bob's silent reception  of her discourtesy had infuriated her, and she knew better than Betty  where she stood in the boy's estimation. She had instantly forfeited his  respect and probably his admiration forever.    In a few minutes Bob was back, and with him the conductor.    \"Young lady, you're in the wrong seat,\" that official announced in a tone  that admitted of no trifling. \"You were in eighteen in the other car and  I had to move you to twenty-three in here. Just follow me, please.\"    He reached in and took one of the suitcases, and Bob matter-of-factly  took the other two. The girl opened her mouth, glanced at the conductor,  and thought better of whatever she was going to say. Meekly she followed  him to another section on the other side of the car and found herself  compelled to share a seat with a severe-looking gray-haired woman,  evidently a sufferer from hay fever, as she sneezed incessantly.    Bob dropped down in his old place and shot a quizzical look at Betty.    \"Flame City may be tough,\" he observed, \"and I'd be the last one to claim  that it possessed one grain of culture; but at that, I can't remember  having a pitched battle with a girl during my care-free existence there.\"    \"She's used to having her own way,\" said Betty, with a laudable ambition  to be charitable, an intention which she inadvertently destroyed by  adding vigorously: \"She'd get that knocked out of her if she lived West a  little while.\"    \"Guess the East can be trusted to smooth her down,\" commented Bob grimly.  \"Unless she's planning to live in seclusion, she won't get far in peace  or happiness unless she behaves a bit more like a human being.\"    The girl was more or less in evidence during the rest of the trip and  incurred the cordial enmity of every woman in the car by the coolness  with which she appropriated the dressing room in the morning and curled  her hair and made an elaborate toilet in perfect indifference to the  other feminine travelers who were shut out till she had the last hairpin  adjusted to her satisfaction.    She was met at the Chicago terminal by a party of gay friends who whisked  her off in a palatial car, and Bob and Betty who, acting on Mr. Gordon's  advice, spent their two-hour wait between trains driving along the Lake  Shore Drive, forgot her completely.    But first Betty fell victim to the charms of a hat displayed in a smart  little millinery shop, and had an argument with Bob in which she came  off victor.    \"Oh, Bob, what a darling hat!\" she had exclaimed, drawing him over to the  window as they turned down the first street from the station. \"I must  have it; I"]]]
