If  ancient accounts might be trusted, this dominion was glorious and  flourishing, for Umbria numbered, they say, three hundred and fifty-eight  towns; but falsehood, according to the Eastern proverb, lurks by the  cradle of nations.  At a much later epoch, in the second century B.C.,  fifteen towns of Liguria contained altogether, as we learn from Livy, but  twenty thousand souls.  It is plain, then, what must really have been--  even admitting their existence--the three hundred and fifty-eight towns  of Umbria.  However, at the end of two or three centuries, this Gallic  colony succumbed beneath the superior power of the Etruscans, another set  of invaders from eastern Europe, perhaps from the north of Greece, who  founded in Italy a mighty empire.  The Umbrians or Ambrons were driven  out or subjugated.  Nevertheless some of their peoplets, preserving their  name and manners, remained in the mountains of upper Italy, where they  were to be subsequently discovered by fresh and more celebrated Gallic  invasions.    Those just spoken of are of such antiquity and obscurity, that we note  their place in history without being able to say how they came to fill  it.  It is only with the sixth century before our era that we light upon  the really historical expeditions of the Gauls away from Gaul, those, in  fact, of which we may follow the course and estimate the effects.    Towards the year 587 B.C., almost at the very moment when the Phoceans  had just founded Marseilles, two great Gallic hordes got in motion at the  same time, and crossed, one the Rhine, the other the Alps, making one for  Germany, the other for Italy.  The former followed the course of the  Danube and settled in Illyria, on the right bank of the river.  It is too  much, perhaps, to say that they settled; the greater part of them  continued wandering and fighting, sometimes amalgamating with the  peoplets they encountered, sometimes chasing them and exterminating them,  whilst themselves were incessantly pushed forward by fresh bands coming  also from Gaul.  Thus marching and spreading, leaving here and there on  their route, along the rivers and in the valleys of the Alps, tribes that  remained and founded peoples, the Gauls had arrived, towards the year 340  B.C., at the confines of Macedonia, at the time when Alexander, the son  of Philip, who was already famous, was advancing to the same point to  restrain the ravages of the neighboring tribes, perhaps of the Gauls  themselves.  From curiosity, or a desire to make terms with Alexander,  certain Gauls betook themselves to his camp.  He treated them well, made  them sit at his table, took pleasure in exhibiting his magnificence  before them, and in the midst of his carouse made his interpreter ask  them what they were most afraid of.    \"We fear nought,\" they answered, \"unless it be the fall of heaven; but we  set above everything the friendship of a man like thee.\"  \"The Celts are  proud,\" said Alexander to his Macedonians; and he promised them his  friendship.  On the death of Alexander, the Gauls, as mercenaries,  entered, in Europe and Asia, the service of the kings who had been his  generals.  Ever greedy, fierce, and passionate, they were almost equally  dangerous as auxiliaries and as neighbors.  Antigonus, King of Macedonia,  was to pay the band he had enrolled a gold piece a head.  They brought  their wives and children with them, and at the end of the campaign they  claimed pay for their following as well as for themselves: \"We were  promised,\" said they, \"a gold piece a head for each Gaul; and these are  also Gauls.\"    Before long they tired of fighting the battles of another; their power  accumulated; fresh hordes, in great numbers, arrived amongst them about  the year 281 B.C.  They had before them Thrace, Macedonia, Thessaly,  Greece, rich, but distracted and weakened by civil strife.  They effected  an entrance at several points, devastating, plundering, loading their  cars with booty, and dividing their prisoners into two parts; one offered  in sacrifice to their gods, the other strung up to trees and abandoned to  the _gais_ and _matars,_ or javelins and pikes of the conquerors.    Like all barbarians, they, both for pleasure and on principle, added  insolence to ferocity.  Their Brenn, or most famous chieftain, whom the  Latins and Greeks call Brennus, dragged in his train Macedonian  prisoners, short, mean, and with shaven heads, and exhibiting them beside  Gallic warriors, tall, robust, long-haired, adorned with chains of gold,  said, \"This is what we are, that is what our enemies are.\"    Ptolemy the Thunderbolt, King of Macedonia, received with haughtiness  their first message requiring of him a ransom for his dominions if he  wished to preserve peace.  \"Tell those who sent you,\" he replied to the  Gallic deputation, \"to lay down their arms and give up to me their  chieftains.  I will then see what peace I can grant them.\"  On the return  of the deputation, the Gauls were moved to laughter.  \"He shall soon  see,\" said they, \"whether it was in his interest or our own that we  offered him peace.\"  And, indeed, in the first engagement, neither the  famous Macedonian phalanx, nor the elephant he rode, could save King  Ptolemy; the phalanx was broken, the elephant riddled with javelins, the  king himself taken, killed, and his head marched about the field of  battle on the top of a pike.    Macedonia was in consternation; there was a general flight from the open  country, and the gates of the towns were closed.  \"The people,\" says an  historian, \"cursed the folly of King Ptolemy, and invoked the names of  Philip and Alexander, the guardian deities of their land.\"    Three years later, another and a more formidable invasion came bursting  upon Thessaly and Greece.  It was, according to the unquestionably  exaggerated account of the ancient historians, two hundred thousand  strong, and commanded by that famous, ferocious, and insolent Brennus  mentioned before.  His idea was to strike a blow which should  simultaneously enrich the Gauls and stun the Greeks.  He meant to plunder  the temple at Delphi, the most venerated place in all Greece, whither  flowed from century to century all kinds of offerings, and where, no  doubt, enormous treasure was deposited.  Such was, in the opinion of the  day, the sanctity of the place, that, on the rumor of the projected  profanation, several Greeks essayed to divert the Gallic Brenn himself,  by appealing to his superstitious fears; but his answer was, \"The gods  have no need of wealth; it is they who distribute it to men.\"    All Greece was moved.  The nations of the Peloponnese closed the isthmus  of Corinth by a wall.  Outside the isthmus, the Beeotians, Phocidians,  Locrians, Megarians, and AEtolians formed a coalition under the  leadership of the Athenians; and, as their ancestors had done scarcely  two hundred years before against Xerxes and the Persians, they advanced  in all haste to the pass of Thermopylae, to stop there the new  barbarians.    And for several days they did stop them; and instead of three hundred  heroes, as of yore in the case of Leonidas and his Spartans, only forty  Greeks, they say, fell in the first engagement.  'Amongst them was a  young Athenian, Cydias by name, whose shield was hung in the temple of  Zeus the savior, at Athens, with this inscription:--           THIS SHIELD, DEDICATED TO ZEUS, IS THAT OF A VALIANT MAN,                         CYDIAS.  IT STILL BEWAILS ITS                       YOUNG MASTER.  FOR THE FIRST TIME                           HE BARE IT ON HIS LEFT ARM                           WHEN TERRIBLE ARES CRUSHED                                   THE GAULS.    But soon, just as in the case of the Persians, traitors guided Brennus  and his Gauls across the mountain-paths; the position of Thermopylae was  turned; the Greek army owed its safety to the Athenian galleys; and by  evening of the same day the barbarians appeared in sight of Delphi.    Brennus would have led them at once to the assault.  He showed them, to  excite them, the statues, vases, cars, monuments of every kind, laden  with gold, which adorned the approaches of the town and of the temple:  \"'Tis pure gold--massive gold,\" was the news he had spread in every  direction.  But the very cupidity he provoked was against his plan; for  the Gauls fell out to plunder.  He had to put off the assault until the  morrow.  The night was passed in irregularities and orgies.    The Greeks, on the contrary, prepared with ardor for the fight.  Their  enthusiasm was intense.  Those barbarians, with their half-nakedness,  their grossness, their ferocity, their ignorance, and their impiety, were  revolting.  They committed murder and devastation like dolts.  They left  their dead on the field, without burial.  They engaged in battle without  consulting priest or augur.  It was not only their goods, but their  families, their life, the honor of their country, and the sanctuary of  their religion, that the Greeks were defending, and they might rely on  the protection of the gods.  The oracle of Apollo had answered, \"I and  the white virgins will provide for this matter.\"  The people surrounded  the temple, and the priests supported and encouraged the people.  During  the night small bodies of AEtolians, Amphisseans, and Phocidians arrived  one after another.  Four thousand men had joined within Delphi, when the  Gallic bands, in the morning, began to mount the narrow and rough incline  which led up to the town.  The Greeks rained down from above a deluge of  stones and other missiles.  The Gauls recoiled, but recovered  themselves.

I will give you thirty  thousand byzants of gold if you promise me Jerusalem, and you shall have  liberty to go whither you will and do your tillage, to a distance of five  miles from the city.  And I will have you sup-plied with such plenty of  provisions that in no place on earth shall they be so cheap.  You shall  have a truce from now to Whitsuntide, and when this time comes, if you  see that you may have aid, then hold on.  But if not, you shall give up  the city, and I will have you conveyed in safety to Christian territory,  yourselves and your substance.\"  \"We may not yield up to you a city where  died our God,\" answered the envoys: \"and still less may we sell you.\"  The siege lasted fourteen days.  After having repulsed several assaults,  the inhabitants saw that effectual resistance was impossible; and the  commandant of the place, a knight named Dalian d'Ibelin, an old warrior,  who had been at the battle of Tiberias, returned to Saladin, and asked  for the conditions back again which had at first been rejected.  Saladin,  pointing to his own banner already planted upon several parts of the  battlements, answered, \"It is too late; you surely see that the city is  mine.\"  \"Very well, my lord,\" replied the knight: \"we will ourselves  destroy our city, and the mosque of Omar, and the stone of Jacob: and  when it is nothing but a heap of ruins, we will sally forth with sword  and fire in hand, and not one of us will go to Paradise without having  sent ten Mussulmans to hell.\"  Saladin understood enthusiasm, and  respected it; and to have had the destruction of Jerusalem connected with  his name would' have caused him deep displeasure.  He therefore consented  to the terms of capitulation demanded of him.  The fighting men were  permitted to retreat to Tyre or Tripolis, the last cities of any  importance, besides Antioch, in the power of the Christians; and the  simple inhabitants of Jerusalem had their lives preserved, and permission  given them to purchase their freedom on certain conditions; but, as many  amongst them could not find the means, Malek-Adhel, the sultan's brother,  and Saladin himself paid the ransom of several thousands of captives.  All Christians, however, with the exception of Greeks and Syrians, had  orders to leave Jerusalem within four days.  When the day came, all the  gates were closed, except that of David by which the people were to go  forth; and Saladin, seated upon a throne, saw the Christians defile  before him.  First came the patriarch, followed by the clergy, carrying  the sacred vessels, and the ornaments of the church of the Holy  Sepulchre.  After him came Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem, who had remained  in the city, whilst her husband, Guy de Lusignan, had been a prisoner at  Nablous since the battle of Tiberias.  Saladin saluted her respectfully,  and spoke to her kindly.  He had too great a soul to take pleasure in the  humiliation of greatness.    [Illustration: The Christians of the Holy City defiling before Saladin.--  --28]    The news, spreading through Europe, caused amongst all classes there,  high and low, a deep feeling of sorrow, anger, disquietude, and shame.  Jerusalem was a very different thing from Edessa.  The fall of the  kingdom of Jerusalem meant the sepulchre of Jesus Christ fallen once more  into the hands of the infidels, and, at the same time, the destruction of  what had been wrought by Christian Europe in the East, the loss of the  only striking and permanent gage of her victories.  Christian pride was  as much wounded as Christian piety.  A new fact, moreover, was  conspicuous in this series of reverses and in the accounts received of  them; after all its defeats and in the midst of its discord, Islamry had  found a chieftain and a hero.  Saladin was one of those strange and  superior beings who, by their qualities and by their very defects, make a  strong impression upon the imaginations of men, whether friends or foes.  His Mussulman fanaticism was quite as impassioned as the Christian  fanaticism of the most ardent crusaders.  When he heard that Reginald of  Chatillon, Lord of Karat, on the confines of Palestine and Arabia, had  all but succeeded in an attempt to go and pillage the Caaba and the tomb  of Mahomet, he wrote to his brother Malek-Adhel, at that time governor of  Egypt, \"The infidels have violated the home and the cradle of Islamism;  they have profaned our sanctuary.  Did we not prevent a like insult  (which God forbid!) we should render ourselves guilty in the eyes of God  and the eyes of men.  Purge we, therefore, our land from these men who  dishonor it; purge we the very air from the air they breathe.\"  He  commanded that all the Christians who could possibly be captured on this  occasion should be put to death; and many were taken to Mecca, where the  Mussulman pilgrims immolated them instead of the sheep and lambs they  were accustomed to sacrifice.  The expulsion of the Christians from  Palestine was Saladin's great idea and unwavering passion; and he  severely chid the Mussulmans for their soft-heartedness in the struggle.  \"Behold these Christians,\" he wrote to the Khalif of Bagdad, \"how they  come crowding in!  How emulously they press on!  They are continually  receiving fresh re-enforcements more numerous than the waves of the sea,  and to us more bitter than its brackish waters.  Where one dies by land,  a thousand come by sea.  .  .  .  The crop is more abundant than the  harvest; the tree puts forth more branches than the axe can lop off.  It  is true that great numbers have already perished, insomuch that the edge  of our swords is blunted; but our comrades are beginning to grow weary of  so long a war.  Haste we, therefore, to implore the help of the Lord.\"  Nor needed he the excuse of passion in order to be cruel and sanguinary  when he considered it would serve his cause; for human lives and deaths  he had that barbaric indifference which Christianity alone has rooted out  from the communities of men, whilst it has remained familiar to the  Mussulman.  When he found himself, either during or after a battle,  confronted by enemies whom he really dreaded, such as the Hospitallers of  St. John of Jerusalem or the Templars, he had them massacred, and  sometimes gave them their death-blow himself, with cool satisfaction.  But, apart from open war and the hatred inspired by passion or cold  calculation, he was moderate and generous, gentle towards the vanquished  and the weak, just and compassionate towards his subjects, faithful to  his engagements, and capable of feeling sympathetic admiration for men,  even his enemies, in whom he recognized superior qualities, courage,  loyalty, and loftiness of mind.  For Christian knighthood, its precepts  and the noble character it stamped upon its professors, he felt so much  respect and even inclination that the wish of his heart, it is said, was  to receive the title of knight, and that he did, in fact, receive it with  the approval of Richard Coeur de Lion.  By reason of all these facts and  on all these grounds he acquired, even amongst the Christians, that  popularity which attaches itself to greatness justified by personal deeds  and living proofs, in spite of the fear and even the hatred inspired  thereby.  Christian Europe saw in him the able and potent chief of  Mussulman Asia, and, whilst detesting, admired him.    After the capture of Jerusalem by Saladin, the Christians of the East, in  their distress, sent to the West their most eloquent prelate and gravest  historian William, Archbishop of Tyre, who, fifteen years before, in the  reign of Baldwin IV., had been Chancellor of the kingdom of Jerusalem.  He, accompanied by a legate of Pope Gregory VIII., scoured Italy, France,  and Germany, recounting everywhere the miseries of the Holy Land, and  imploring the aid of all Christian princes and peoples, whatever might be  their own position of affairs and their own quarrels in Europe.  At a  parliament assembled at Gisors, on the 21st of January, 1188, and at a  diet convoked at Mayence on the 27th of March following, he so powerfully  affected the knighthood of France, England, and Germany, that the three  sovereigns of these three states, Philip Augustus, Richard Coeur de Lion,  and Frederick Barbarossa, engaged with acclamation in a new crusade.  They were princes of very different ages and degrees of merit, but all  three distinguished for their personal qualities as well as their  puissance.  Frederick Barbarossa was sixty-seven, and for the last  thirty-six years had been leading, in Germany and Italy, as politician  and soldier, a very active and stormy existence.  Richard Cceur de Lion  was thirty-one, and had but just ascended the throne where he was to  shine as the most valiant and adventurous of knights rather than as a  king.  Philip Augustus, though only twenty-three, had already shown  signs, beneath the vivacious sallies of youth, of the reflective and  steady ability characteristic of riper age.  Of these three sovereigns,  the eldest, Frederick Barbarossa, was first ready to plunge amongst the  perils of the crusade.  Starting from Ratisbonne about Christmas, 1189,  with an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men, he traversed the  Greek empire and Asia Minor, defeated the Sultan of Iconium, passed the  first defiles of Taurus, and seemed to be approaching the object of his  voyage, when, on the 10th of June, 1190, having arrived at the borders of  the Selef, a small river which throws itself into the Mediterranean close  to Seleucia, he determined to cross it by fording, was seized with a  chill, and, according to some, drowned before his people's eyes, but,  according to others, carried dying to Seleucia, where he expired.
