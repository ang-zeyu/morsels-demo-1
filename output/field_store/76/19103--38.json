If a peculiarly bloody murder has been tried, or if some  domestic intrigue has produced a complicated love story, however offensive  in its details, you will find our reading crowd stationary in that quarter,  to enjoy the tragic stimulants of terror and pity. We have also a modest  corner of the square appropriated to the use of our posts; but like  Polydorus's ghost, they generally utter doleful soliloquies, which no one  will stop to hear.    _London Review._           *       *       *       *       *      BEAUTY.      It is vain to dispute about the matter; moralists may moralize, preachers  may sermonize about it as much as they please; still beauty is a most  delightful thing,--and a really lovely woman a most enchanting object to  gaze on. I am aware of all that can be said about roses fading, and cheeks  withering, and lips growing thin and pale. No one, indeed, need be ignorant  of every change which can be rung upon this peal of bells, for every one  must have heard them in every possible, and impossible, variety of  combination. Give time, and complexion will decay, and lips and cheeks will  shrink and grow wrinkled, sure enough. But it is needless to anticipate the  work of years, or to give credit to old Time for his conquests before he  has won them. The edge of his scythe does more execution than that of the  conqueror's sword: we need not add the work of fancy to _his_,--it is more  than sufficiently sure and rapid already.    _Tales of Passion._           *       *       *       *       *      PRE-AUX-CLERCS.      In 1559, the most frequented promenade in Paris was the _Pre-aux-Clercs_,  situated where a part of the Faubourg St. Germain is at present. The  students of the university were generally in favour of the reformed  religion, and not only made a profession of it, but publicly defended its  principles. They had been in the habit of meeting at this place for several  years, and the monks of the Abbey St. Victor having refused to let them  assemble in the Pre-aux-Clercs, a serious affair sprung out of the refusal,  and several rencounters took place, in which blood was shed; the students,  being the most numerous, carried their point, the monks resigned the field  to them, and the Pre-aux-Clercs was more than ever frequented. It became  the grand rendezvous of all the Protestants, who would sing Marot's psalms  during the summer evenings; and such numbers giving confidence, many  persons declared themselves Protestants, whose rank had hitherto deterred  them from such a step. Among such, the most eminent was Anthony of Bourbon,  first prince of the blood, and, in right of his wife, king of Navarre.    _Browning's History of the Hugonots._           *       *       *       *       *      LOVE.      When she learned the vocabulary, she did not find that admiration meant  love; she did not find that gratitude meant love; she did not find that  habit meant love; she did not find that approbation meant love; but in  process of time she began to suspect that all these put together produced a  feeling very much like love.    _Rank and Talent._           *       *       *       *       *      HUGONOTS.      Various definitions of this epithet exist. Pasquier says it arose from  their assembling at Hugon's Tower, at Tours; he also mentions, that in 1540  he heard them called _Tourangeaux_. Some have attributed the term to the  commencement of their petitions, \"_Huc nos venimus._\" A more probable  reason is to be found in the name of a party at Geneva, called _Eignots_, a  term derived from the German, and signifying a sworn confederate. Voltaire  and the Jesuit Maimbourg are both of this opinion.    _Browning's History of the Hugonots._           *       *       *       *       *      A ROUT.      A great, large, noisy, tumultuous, promiscuous, crowding, crushing,  perfumed, feathered, flowered, painted, gabbling, sneering, idle,  gossiping, rest-breaking, horse-killing, panel-breaking, supper-scrambling  evening-party is much better imagined than described, for the description  is not worth the time of writing or reading it.    _Rank and Talent._           *       *       *       *       *      PLEASURE.        We are mad gamesters in this world below,    All hopes on one uncertain die to throw;    How vain is man's pursuit, with passion blind,    To follow that which leaves us still behind!    Go! clasp the shadow, make it all thine own,    Place on the flying breeze thine airy throne;    Weave the thin sunbeams of the morning sky;    Catch the light April clouds before they fly;    Chase the bright sun unto the fading west,    And wake him early from his golden rest;    Seeking th' impossible, let life be past,    But never dream of pleasure that shall last.    _The Ruined City._           *       *       *       *       *      GERMAN LIFE.      One day (says a late adventurer,) that I was quartered in a farm-house,  along with some of our German dragoons, the owner came to complain to me  that the soldiers had been killing his fowls, and pointed out one man in  particular as the principal offender. The fact being brought home to the  dragoon, he excused himself by saying, \"One shiken come frighten my horse,  and I give him one kick, and he die.\" \"Oh, but,\" said I, \"the _patron_  contends that you killed more than one fowl.\" \"Oh yes; that shiken moder  see me kick that shiken, so she come fly in my face, and I give her one  kick, and she die.\" Of course I reported the culprit to his officer, by  whom he was punished as a notorious offender.    _Twelve Years' Military Adventures._           *       *       *       *       *      THE HEIR.      Persons who are very rich, and have no legal heirs, may entertain  themselves very much at the expense of hungry expectants and lean  legacy-hunters. Who has not seen a poor dog standing on his hind legs, and  bobbing up and down after a bone scarcely worth picking, with which some  mischief-loving varlet has tantalized the poor animal till all its limbs  have ached? That poor dog shadows out the legacy-hunter or possible heir.    _Rank and Talent._           *       *       *       *       *      The author of \"_The Journal of a Naturalist_,\" just published, relates the  following incident that occurred a few years past at a lime-kiln, (on the  old Bristol Road) because it manifests how perfectly insensible the human  frame may be to pains and afflictions in peculiar circumstances; and that  which would be torture if endured in general, may be experienced at other  times without any sense of suffering. A travelling man one winter's evening  laid himself down upon the platform of a lime-kiln, placing his feet,  probably numbed with cold, upon the heap of stones newly put on to burn  through the night. Sleep overcame him in this situation; the fire gradually  rising and increasing until it ignited the stones upon which his feet were  placed. Lulled by the warmth, he still slept; and though the fire  increased until it burned one foot (which probably was extended over a vent  hole) and part of the leg, above the ankle, entirely off, consuming that  part so effectually, that no fragment of it was ever discovered; the  wretched being slept on! and in this state was found by the kiln-man in the  morning. Insensible to any pain, and ignorant of his misfortune, he  attempted to rise and pursue his journey, but missing his shoe, requested  to have it found; and when he was raised, putting his burnt limb to the  ground to support his body, the extremity of his leg-bone, the tibia,  crumbled into fragments, having been calcined into lime. Still he expressed  no sense of pain, and probably experienced none, from the gradual operation  of the fire and his own torpidity during the hours his foot was consuming.  This poor drover survived his misfortunes in the hospital about a  fortnight; but the fire having extended to other parts of his body,  recovery was hopeless.           *       *       *       *       *      GAMING.      Gambling, the besetting sin of the indolent in many countries, is ruinously  general throughout South America. In England, and other European states, it  is pretty much limited to the unemployed of the upper classes, who furnish  a never-ending supply of dupes to knavery. In South America the passion  taints all ages, both sexes, and every rank. The dregs of society yield to  the fascination as blindly as the high-born and wealthy of the old or of  the new world. It speaks much in favour of the revolution, that this vice  is sensibly diminishing in Peru, and to the unfortunate Monteagudo belongs  the honour of having been the first to attempt its eradication. A noted  gambler was once as much an object of admiration in South America as a  six-bottle man was in England fifty years ago. The houses of the great were  converted into nightly hells, where the priesthood were amongst the most  regular and adventurous attendants. Those places are now more innocently  enlivened by music and dancing. Buena Vista, a seat of the late Marquess of  Montemira, six leagues from Lima, was the Sunday rendezvous of every  fashionable of the capital who had a few doubloons to risk on the turn of a  card. On one occasion, a fortunate player, the celebrated Baquijano, was  under the necessity of sending for a bullock car to convey his winnings,  amounting to above thirty thousand dollars: a mule thus laden with specie  was a common occurrence. Chorillos, a fishing town, three leagues south of  Lima, is a fashionable watering place for a limited season. Here immense  sums are won and lost; but political and literary coteries, formerly  unknown, daily lessen the numbers of the votaries of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11335"],[0,"The Einstein Theory of Relativity: A Concise Statement (#5)"],[1,"time at the University of Prague, he settled in Berlin,  where the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute afforded him the opportunity to  devote himself exclusively to his scientific work. He repeatedly  visited our country and made his Netherland colleagues, among whom he  counts many good friends, partners in his studies and his results. He  attended the last meeting of the department of natural philosophy of  the Royal Academy of Sciences, and the members then had the privilege  of hearing him explain, in his own fascinating, clear and simple way,  his interpretations of the fundamental questions to which his theory  gives rise."]]]
