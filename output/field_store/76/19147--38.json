In many instances their emolument is small; and  when otherwise, the lectures which are required from the professor are  not perhaps in all cases the best mode of employing the energies of  those who are capable of inventing.    I cannot resist the opportunity of supporting these opinions by the  authority of one of the greatest philosophers of a past age, and of  expressing my acknowledgments to the author of a most interesting piece  of scientific biography. In the correspondence which terminated in the  return of Galileo to a professorship in his native country, he remarks,  \"But, because my private lectures and domestic pupils are a great  hinderance and interruption of my studies, I wish to live entirely  exempt from the former, and in great measure from the latter.\"--LIFE  OF GALILEO, p.18. And, in another letter to Kepler, he speaks with  gratitude of Cosmo, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who \"has now invited me  to attach myself to him with the annual salary of 1000 florins, and with  the title of Philosopher and principal Mathematician to his Highness,  without the duties of any office to perform, but with most complete  leisure; so that I can complete my treatise on Mechanics, &c.\"--p.31.  [Life of Galileo, published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful  Knowledge.]    Surely, if knowledge is valuable, it can never be good policy in a  country far wealthier than Tuscany, to allow a genius like Mr. Dalton's,  to be employed in the drudgery of elementary instruction. [I utter these  sentiments from no feelings of private friendship to that estimable  philosopher, to whom it is my regret to be almost unknown, and whose  modest and retiring merit, I may, perhaps, have the misfortune to offend  by these remarks. But Mr. Dalton was of no party; had he ever moved in  that vortex which has brought discredit, and almost ruin, on the Royal  Society of England;--had he taken part with those who vote to each other  medals, and, affecting to be tired of the fatigues of office, make to  each other requisitions to retain places they would be most reluctant  to quit; his great and splendid discovery would long since have been  represented to government. Expectant mediocrity would have urged on his  claims to remuneration, and those who covered their selfish purposes  with the cloak of science, would have hastened to shelter themselves in  the mantle of his glory.--But the philosopher may find consolation for  the tardy approbation of that Society, in the applause of Europe. If  he was insulted by their medal, he escaped the pain of seeing his name  connected with their proceedings.] Where would have been the military  renown of England, if, with an equally improvident waste of mental  power, its institutions had forced the Duke of Wellington to employ his  life in drilling recruits, instead of planning campaigns?    If we look at the fact, we shall find that the great inventions of the  age are not, with us at least, always produced in universities. The  doctrines of \"definite proportions,\" and of the \"chemical agency of  electricity,\"--principles of a high order, which have immortalized the  names of their discoverers,--were not produced by the meditations of  the cloister: nor is it in the least a reproach to those valuable  institutions to mention truths like these. Fortunate circumstances must  concur, even to the greatest, to render them eminently successful. It is  not permitted to all to be born, like Archimedes, when a science was to  be created; nor, like Newton, to find the system of the world \"without  form and void;\" and, by disclosing gravitation, to shed throughout that  system the same irresistible radiance as that with which the Almighty  Creator had illumined its material substance. It can happen to but few  philosophers, and but at distant intervals, to snatch a science, like  Dalton, from the chaos of indefinite combination, and binding it in the  chains of number, to exalt it to rank amongst the exact. Triumphs like  these are necessarily \"few and far between;\" nor can it be expected that  that portion of encouragement, which a country may think fit to bestow  on science, should be adapted to meet such instances. Too extraordinary  to be frequent, they must be left, if they are to be encouraged at all,  to some direct interference of the government.    The dangers to be apprehended from such a specific interference, would  arise from one, or several, of the following circumstances:--That class  of society, from whom the government is selected, might not possess  sufficient knowledge either to judge themselves, or know upon whose  judgment to rely. Or the number of persons devoting themselves to  science, might not be sufficiently large to have due weight in the  expression of public opinion. Or, supposing this class to be large, it  might not enjoy, in the estimation of the world, a sufficiently high  character for independence. Should these causes concur in any country,  it might become highly injurious to commit the encouragement of science  to any department of the government. This reasoning does not appear to  have escaped the penetration of those who advised the abolition of the  late Board of Longitude.    The question whether it is good policy in the government of a country  to encourage science, is one of which those who cultivate it are not  perhaps the most unbiased judges. In England, those who have hitherto  pursued science, have in general no very reasonable grounds of  complaint; they knew, or should have known, that there was no demand for  it, that it led to little honour, and to less profit.    That blame has been attributed to the government for not fostering  the science of the country is certain; and, as far as regards past  administrations, is, to a great extent, just; with respect to the  present ministers, whose strength essentially depends on public opinion,  it is not necessary that they should precede, and they cannot remain  long insensible to any expression of the general feeling. But supposing  science were thought of some importance by any administration, it would  be difficult in the present state of things to do much in its favour;  because, on the one hand, the higher classes in general have not a  profound knowledge of science, and, on the other, those persons whom  they have usually consulted, seem not to have given such advice as to  deserve the confidence of government. It seems to be forgotten, that the  money allotted by government to purposes of science ought to be expended  with the same regard to prudence and economy as in the disposal of money  in the affairs of private life.    [Who, for instance, could have advised the government to incur the  expense of printing SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY copies of the Astronomical  Observations made at Paramatta, to form a third part of the  Philosophical Transactions for 1829, whilst of the Observations made at  the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, two hundred and fifty copies only  are printed?    Of these seven hundred and fifty copies, seven hundred and ten will be  distributed to members of the Royal Society, to six hundred of whom they  will probably be wholly uninteresting or useless; and thus the country  incurs a constantly recurring annual expense. Nor is it easy to see  on what principle a similar destination could be refused for the  observations made at the Cape of Good Hope.]    To those who measure the question of the national encouragement of  science by its value in pounds, shillings, and pence, I will here state  a fact, which, although pretty generally known, still, I think, deserves  attention. A short time since it was discovered by government that the  terms on which annuities had been granted by them were erroneous, and  new tables were introduced by act of Parliament. It was stated at the  time that the erroneous tables had caused a loss to the country of  between two and three millions sterling. The fact of the sale of  those annuities being a losing concern was long known to many; and the  government appear to have been the last to be informed on the subject.  Half the interest of half that loss, judiciously applied to the  encouragement of mathematical science, would, in a few years, have  rendered utterly impossible such expensive errors.    To those who bow to the authority of great names, one remark may have  its weight. The MECANIQUE COELESTE, [The first volume of the first  translation of this celebrated work into our own language, has just  arrived in England from--America.] and the THEORIE ANALYTIQUE DES  PROBABILITES, were both dedicated, by Laplace, to Napoleon. During the  reign of that extraordinary man, the triumphs of France were as eminent  in Science as they were splendid in arms. May the institutions which  trained and rewarded her philosophers be permanent as the benefits they  have conferred upon mankind!    In other countries it has been found, and is admitted, that a knowledge  of science is a recommendation to public appointments, and that a man  does not make a worse ambassador because he has directed an observatory,  or has added by his discoveries to the extent of our knowledge of  animated nature. Instances even are not wanting of ministers who have  begun their career in the inquiries of pure analysis. As such examples  are perhaps more frequent than is generally imagined, it may be useful  to mention a few of those men of science who have formerly held, or who  now hold, high official stations in the governments of their respective  countries.

It is given _literatim_, and the orthographical  errors and mutilation of the story prove that in those days a good and  complete version of India's most celebrated drama was not obtainable.    'HINDU DRAMA. 'SATURDAY, 3D FEBRUARY 1855.    'An outline of the play to be performed at the Theatre this night.    'After a short discourse between the Sutradhar (the chief actor) and  the Vidushaka (the clown), Surswati (the Goddess of learning) will  appear. Sutradhar will call his wife (Nati), and they will determine  on performing the play of Shakuntala. They both will sing songs  together, after which Nati will go away. The play will then regularly  commence. Dushanta Rajah will appear in the Court, and order his  Pradhan (the Minister) to make preparations for a hunting excursion.  The Rajah, sitting in his carriage, will pursue a stag, the stag will  disappear, upon which Dushanta will ask his coachman the cause  thereof, this being known, the Rajah in his carriage will proceed  farther, when they will see the stag again, upon which he will aim an  arrow at the stag. The stag will run and reach the retirement of  Waikhanas Rushi. The sage will come out of his hut and remonstrate  with the Rajah against his killing the harmless animal. The Rajah will  obey the injunctions of the sage, who will pronounce benedictions upon  him. According to the Rushi's instructions, he will prepare to proceed  to the residence of another sage named Kunwa. Bidding each other  farewell, the Rushi will go to procure material for his religious  ceremonies. After reaching Kunwa's place, and commanding his coachman  to groom the horses, the Rajah will walk forth to the sage's hut.  Observing on his way thither Shakuntala with her fellow mates watering  the trees, he will hide himself behind a tree. Shakuntala will praise  to her mates the beauty of the Keshar tree. Charmed with overhearing  her discourse, Dushanta will try to find out her descent. Shakuntala  will be very much teased by a Bhramar (fly) hovering about her face.  The Rajah will then come forward and ask the cause of the disturbed  state of her mind. After a mutual exchange of polite respect they all  take their seats beneath a shady tree, Dushanta will inform her of his  country and descent, whereupon they will all go to the Rushi's hut.    'Here there is a pause. A pleasing farce will then be performed.'    I have already stated that the '[S']akoontala' in the words of my own  translation has been since performed at Bombay and recently at  Trivandrum, the capital of Travancore (see Preface to this edition, p.  vii, &c).]    [Footnote 4: Rogers' Italy, note to line 23.]    [Footnote 5: The admirable Essay by Professor H.H. Wilson, prefixed to  his Hindu Theatre, is the principal source of the information which I  have here given.]    [Footnote 6: Wilson's Hindu Theatre, p. xii.]          RULES FOR THE PRONUNCIATION OF  THE PROPER NAMES.    Observe, that in order to secure the correct pronunciation of the  title of this Drama, 'Sakuntala' has been spelt '[S']akoontala,' the  _u_ of [S']akuntala being pronounced like the _u_ in the English  word _rule_.    The vowel _a_ must invariably be pronounced with a dull sound,  like the _a_ in _organ_, or the _u_ in _gun, sun. Dushyanta_ must  therefore be pronounced as if written _Dooshyunta_. The long  vowel _a_ is pronounced like the _a_ in _last, cart_; _i_ like  the _i_ in _pin, sin_; _i_ like the _i_ in _marine_; _e_ like the  _e_ in _prey_; _o_ like the _o_ in _so_; _ai_ like the _ai_ in  _aisle_; _au_ like _au_ in the German word _haus_, or like the  _ou_ in _our_.    The consonants are generally pronounced as in English, but _g_  has always the sound of _g_ in _gun, give_, never of _g_ in  _gin_. S with the accent over it (s), has the sound of _s_ in  _sure_, or of the last _s_ in _session_.           *       *       *       *       *        PERSONS REPRESENTED.           *       *       *       *       *      DUSHYANTA,    _King of India_.

We are here before the eyes of an audience of educated and  discerning men[3]; and have to represent in their presence a new  drama composed by Kalidasa, called '[S']akoontala; or, the Lost  Ring[4].' Let the whole company exert themselves to do justice to  their several parts.    ACTRESS.    You, Sir, have so judiciously managed the cast of the characters,  that nothing will be defective in the acting.    STAGE-MANAGER.    Lady, I will tell you the exact state of the case,      No skill in acting can I deem complete,    Till from the wise the actor gain applause;    Know that the heart e'en of the truly skilful,    Shrinks from too boastful confidence in self.

What can you do better than engage the attention of the audience  by some captivating melody?    ACTRESS.    Which among the seasons shall I select as the subject of my song?    STAGE-MANAGER.    You surely ought to give the preference to the present Summer  season[5] that has but recently commenced, a season so rich in  enjoyment. For now      Unceasing are the charms of halcyon days,    When the cool bath exhilarates the frame;    When sylvan gales are laden with the scent    Of fragrant Patalas[6]; when soothing sleep    Creeps softly on beneath the deepening shade;    And when, at last, the dulcet calm of eve    Entrancing steals o'er every yielding sense.    ACTRESS.    I will:--                                                           [_Sings_.]      Fond maids, the chosen of their hearts to please,    Entwine their ears with sweet [S']irisha flowers[7],    Whose fragrant lips attract the kiss of bees    That softly murmur through the summer hours.    STAGE-MANAGER.    Charmingly sung! The audience are motionless as statues, their  souls riveted by the enchanting strain. What subject shall we  select for representation, that we may ensure a continuance  of their favour?    ACTRESS.    Why not the same, Sir, announced by you at first? Let the drama  called '[S']akoontala; or, the Lost Ring,' be the subject of our  dramatic performance.    STAGE-MANAGER.    Rightly reminded! For the moment I had forgotten it.      Your song's transporting melody decoyed    My thoughts, and rapt with ecstasy my soul;    As now the bounding antelope allures    The King Dushyanta[8] on the chase intent.
