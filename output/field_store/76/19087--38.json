[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10986"],[0,"Frederick Douglass (#5)"],[1,"England in 1841 was but little  different from that in the State of Georgia to-day. Men of color were  regarded and treated as belonging to a distinctly inferior order of  creation. At hotels and places of public resort they were refused  entertainment. On railroads and steamboats they were herded off by  themselves in mean and uncomfortable cars. If welcomed in churches  at all, they were carefully restricted to the negro pew. As in the  Southern States to-day, no distinction was made among them in these  respects by virtue of dress or manners or culture or means; but all  were alike discriminated against because of their dark skins. Some  of Douglass's abolition friends, among whom he especially mentions  Wendell Phillips and two others of lesser note, won their way to his  heart by at all times refusing to accept privileges that were denied  to their swarthy companion. Douglass resented proscription wherever  met with, and resisted it with force when the odds were not too  overwhelming. More than once he was beaten and maltreated by railroad  conductors and brakemen. For a time the Eastern Railroad ran its cars  through Lynn, Massachusetts, without stopping, because Douglass, who  resided at that time in Lynn, insisted on riding in the white people's  car, and made trouble when interfered with. Often it was impossible  for the abolitionists to secure a meeting-place; and in several  instances Douglass paraded the streets with a bell, like a town crier,  to announce that he would lecture in the open air.    Some of Douglass's friends, it must be admitted, were at times rather  extreme in their language, and perhaps stirred up feelings that a  more temperate vocabulary would not have aroused. None of them ever  hesitated to call a spade a spade, and some of them denounced slavery  and all its sympathizers with the vigor and picturesqueness of a  Muggletonian or Fifth Monarchy man of Cromwell's time execrating his  religious adversaries. And, while it was true enough that the Church  and the State were, generally speaking, the obsequious tools of  slavery, it was not easy for an abolitionist to say so in vehement  language without incurring the charge of treason or blasphemy,--an old  trick of bigotry and tyranny to curb freedom of thought and freedom of  speech. The little personal idiosyncrasies which some of the reformers  affected, such as long hair in the men and short hair in the  women,--there is surely some psychological reason why reformers run  to such things,--served as convenient excuses for gibes and unseemly  interruptions at their public meetings. On one memorable occasion,  at Syracuse, New York, in November, 1842, Douglass and his fellows  narrowly escaped tar and feathers. But, although Douglass was  vehemently denunciatory of slavery in all its aspects, his twenty  years of training in that hard school had developed in him a vein of  prudence that saved him from these verbal excesses,--perhaps there was  also some element of taste involved,--and thus made his arguments more  effective than if he had alienated his audiences by indiscriminate  attacks on all the institutions of society. No one could justly  accuse Frederick Douglass of cowardice or self-seeking; yet he was  opportunist enough to sacrifice the immaterial for the essential, and  to use the best means at hand to promote the ultimate object sought,  although the means thus offered might not be the ideal instrument. It  was doubtless this trait that led Douglass, after he separated from  his abolitionist friends, to modify his views upon the subject  of disunion and the constitutionality of slavery, and to support  political parties whose platforms by no means expressed the full  measure of his convictions.    In 1843 the New England Anti-slavery Society resolved, at its annual  meeting in the spring, to stir the Northern heart and rouse the  national conscience by a series of one hundred conventions in New  Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.  Douglass was assigned as one of the agents for the conduct of this  undertaking. Among those associated in this work, which extended over  five months, were John A. Collins, the president of the society, who  mapped out the campaign; James Monroe; George Bradburn; William A.  White; Charles L. Remond, a colored orator, born in Massachusetts, who  rendered effective service in the abolition cause; and Sidney Howard  Gay, at that time managing editor of the _National Anti-slavery  Standard_ and later of the New York _Tribune_ and the New York  _Evening Post._    The campaign upon which this little band of missionaries set out was  no inconsiderable one. They were not going forth to face enthusiastic  crowds of supporters, who would meet them with brass bands and shouts  of welcome. They were more likely to be greeted with hisses and  cat-calls, sticks and stones, stale eggs and decayed cabbages, hoots  and yells of derision, and decorations of tar and feathers.    In some towns of Vermont slanderous reports were made in advance of  their arrival, their characters were assailed, and their aims and  objects misrepresented. In Syracuse, afterward distinguished for its  strong anti-slavery sentiment, the abolitionists were compelled to  hold their meetings in the public park, from inability to procure a  house in which to speak; and only after their convention was well  under way were they offered the shelter of a dilapidated and abandoned  church. In Rochester they met with a more hospitable reception. The  indifference of Buffalo so disgusted Douglass's companions that they  shook the dust of the city from their feet, and left Douglass, who was  accustomed to coldness and therefore undaunted by it, to tread the  wine-press alone. He spoke in an old post-office for nearly a week,  to such good purpose that a church was thrown open to him; and on  a certain Sunday, in the public park, he held and thrilled by his  eloquence an audience of five thousand people.    On leaving Buffalo, Douglass joined the other speakers, and went  with them to Clinton County, Ohio, where, under a large tent, a mass  meeting was held of abolitionists who had come from widely scattered  points. During an excursion made about this time to Pennsylvania to  attend a convention at Norristown, an attempt was made to lynch him at  Manayunk; but his usual good fortune served him, and he lived to be  threatened by higher powers than a pro-slavery mob.    When the party of reformers reached Indiana, where the pro-slavery  spirit was always strong, the State having been settled largely by  Southerners, their campaign of education became a running fight, in  which Douglass, whose dark skin attracted most attention, often got  more than his share. His strength and address brought him safely  out of many an encounter; but in a struggle with a mob at Richmond,  Indiana, he was badly beaten and left unconscious on the ground. A  good Quaker took him home in his wagon, his wife bound up Douglass's  wounds and nursed him tenderly,--the Quakers were ever the consistent  friends of freedom,--but for the lack of proper setting he carried to  the grave a stiff hand as the result of this affray. He had often been  introduced to audiences as \"a graduate from slavery with his diploma  written upon his back\": from Indiana he received the distinction of a  post-graduate degree.          V.      It can easily be understood that such a man as Douglass, thrown thus  into stimulating daily intercourse with some of the brightest minds  of his generation, all animated by a high and noble enthusiasm for  liberty and humanity,--such men as Garrison and Phillips and Gay  and Monroe and many others,--should have developed with remarkable  rapidity those reserves of character and intellect which slavery had  kept in repression. And yet, while aware of his wonderful talent for  oratory, he never for a moment let this knowledge turn his head or  obscure the consciousness that he had brought with him out of slavery  of some of the disabilities of that status. Naturally, his expanding  intelligence sought a wider range of expression; and his simple  narrative of the wrongs of slavery gave way sometimes to a discussion  of its philosophy. His abolitionist friends would have preferred  him to stick a little more closely to the old line,--to furnish the  experience while they provided the argument. But the strong will that  slavery had not been able to break was not always amenable to politic  suggestion. Douglass's style and vocabulary and logic improved so  rapidly that people began to question his having been a slave.  His appearance, speech, and manner differed so little in material  particulars from those of his excellent exemplars that many people  were sceptical of his antecedents. Douglass had, since his escape from  slavery, carefully kept silent about the place he came from and his  master's name and the manner of his escape, for the very good  reason that their revelation would have informed his master of his  whereabouts and rendered his freedom precarious; for the fugitive  slave law was in force, and only here and there could local public  sentiment have prevented its operation. Confronted with the  probability of losing his usefulness, as the \"awful example,\" Douglass  took the bold step of publishing in the spring of 1845 the narrative  of his experience as a slave, giving names of people and places, and  dates as nearly as he could recall them. His abolitionist friends  doubted the expediency of this step; and Wendell Phillips advised him  to throw the manuscript into the fire, declaring that the government  of Massachusetts had neither the power nor the will to protect him  from the consequences of his daring.    The pamphlet was widely read. It was written in a style of graphic  simplicity, and was such an _expose_ of slavery as exasperated its  jealous supporters and beneficiaries. Douglass soon had excellent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11015"],[0,"Pantheism, Its Story and Significance (#5)"],[1,"theory of an ultimate \"principle,\" by substituting air or fire for  water. But it is worth while to note that another citizen of Miletus,  Anaximander, after an interval of some forty years, pronounced that the  beginning, the first principle, the origin of all things, was neither  water, nor air, nor fire, but the Infinite ([Greek: to apeae on]). And  though the best authorities confess that they cannot be sure of his  meaning, this may very well be because he anticipated Herbert Spencer by  two and a half millenniums, in acknowledging that all things merge in  one and the same Unknowable. But, so far as our evidence goes, he made  no such attempt as the modern philosopher did, to persuade the religious  instinct that this Unknowable could supply the place of all the gods.    [Sidenote: Xenophanes of Elea, about 570 to 480 B.C.]    [Sidenote: His Pantheism Disputed but well Established.]    [Sidenote: His Religion.]    The position of Xenophanes, who, toward the latter part of the sixth  century B.C. migrated, apparently for political reasons, in fear of  Persian imperialism, from Colophon in Asia Minor to Elea in Italy, was a  little different, and, for our purpose, more interesting. For the few  fragments which are unfortunately all that is left to us of his  philosophical poetry, are strongly suggestive of Pantheism, and the  interpretation put upon them by later classical and sub-classical  writers, who had his works before them, would appear decisive. True, the  distinguished and enlightened scholar, Simon Karsten, who, in the first  quarter of the nineteenth century, found a labour of love in collecting  and editing the remains of early Greek philosophers, deprecated such a  judgment. Yet, while the motives for his special pleading were  honourable, seeing the odious misrepresentations of Pantheism still  prevalent in the Dutch scholar's native land,--misrepresentations  undissipated even by the splendour of Spinoza,--his protest remains  special pleading still. And he himself candidly quotes at large from an  alleged work of Aristotle--possibly, only a student's notes of the  latter's lectures--and also from Simplicius, as reported by Theophrastus  in a comment on Aristotle's Physics, sentences which describe the system  of Xenophanos as unquestionably Pantheistic. From, which description I  gather that the devout philosopher regarded God as the only real Being,  including all that in human language has been, is, and will be, without  beginning or end, living and perceiving equally everywhere throughout  His infinite essence. And if that essence is compared by Xenophanes to a  sphere, neither bounded nor boundless, neither moving nor immovable,  this is only because few, if any, in that age of the world, could  content themselves with loyally accepting the limits imposed on man by  the very nature of things, limits which now compel us to own that, while  the Eternal is more real than ourselves, yet, in the strict sense of  knowing, He is, from an intellectual standpoint, the Unknowable.    [Sidenote: Extent of his Sympathy with Popular Religion.]    [Sidenote: A Pantheistic Communion Feast.]    This Pantheism did not generate in Xenophanes any arrogant disdain for  the religion of his time. For, though he condemned, in words often  quoted, the folly which supposed the gods to have the human form,  senses, passions and appetites, he was yet glad to worship the divine  All as partially manifested in finite beings--perhaps personified powers  of nature. Thus among the fragments of his poetry fortunately preserved,  is one exquisite gem, a description of a festive repast in the open air.  There purity comes first, symbolised by clear floor, clean hands, and  spotless dishes. Upon purity waits beauty, not in the forms desired by  sensuous passion, but in garlands of flowers and in delicate scents. The  wine is unstinted, yet tempered with sparkling water. But, lest the  plentifulness of bread and honey and cheese upon the lordly table should  eclipse the highest sanctions of human joy, an altar prominent in the  festive scene is heaped with offerings of flowers. Then the first note  of music is the praise of God, a praise taking form in blameless poetic  myths and holy thoughts. In such a feast the minds of the guests are  kindled with a desire to be capable of doing right. \"There is no harm in  drinking with reasonable moderation[10]; and we may honour the guest  who, warmed by wine, talks of such noble deeds and instances of virtue  as his memory may suggest. But let him not tell of Titan battles, or  those of the giants or centaurs, the fictions of bygone days, nor yet of  factious quarrels, nor gossip, that can serve no good end. Rather let  us ever keep a good conscience towards the gods.\"[11]    [Sidenote: Empedocles, Middle of Fifth Century B.C.]    [Sidenote: Not Properly a Pantheist]    Having given so much space to an ancient who seems to me specially  interesting as a prophet of the ultimate apotheosis of earthly  religions, I must be content to indicate, in a very few lines, the  course of the Pantheistic tradition among the Greeks after his day. The  arithmetical mysticism of Pythagoras has no bearing upon our subject.  Empedocles of Agrigentum, living about the middle of the fifth century  B.C., and thus, perhaps, in the second generation after Xenophanes, was,  in many respects, a much more imposing figure--clothed in purple,  wielding political power, possessing medical skill, and even working  miraculous cures, such as are apparently easy to men of personal  impressiveness, sympathy, and \"magnetism.\" But he does not appear to  have so nearly anticipated modern Pantheism as did his humbler  predecessor. For though the fragments of Empedocles, much larger in  volume than those of Xenophanes, certainly hint at some kind of  everlasting oneness in things, and expressly tell us that there is no  creation nor annihilation, but only perpetual changes of arrangement,  yet they present other phases of thought, apparently irreconcileable  with the doctrine that there is nothing other than God. Thus he teaches  that there are four elements--earth, air, water and fire--out of which  all things are generated. He also anticipates Lucretius in his  pessimistic view of humanity's lot; and insists on the apparently  independent existence of a principle of discord or strife in the  Universe. It would be a forced interpretation to suppose him to have set  forth precociously the Darwinian theory of the struggle for life. For  his notion seems much more akin to the Zoroastrian imagination of  Ahriman. Again, he sings melodiously, but most unphilosophically, of a  former golden age, in which the lion and the lamb would seem to have  lain down together in peace; and trees yielded fruit all the year round.  At that time the only deity was Venus, who was worshipped with bloodless  offerings alone. Still, it must be remembered that, whether consistently  or not, Empedocles produced an elaborate work on the Nature of Things,  to which Lucretius makes eloquent and earnest acknowledgments. But that  very approval of Lucretius forbids us to regard the older poet as a  Pantheist in our sense of the term. For certainly to him the Universe  cannot have been a living God.    [Sidenote: Genesis of Modern Religious Pantheism.]    Between this philosophical idea of a Oneness, not thought of as God, and  the spiritual contemplation of a universal Life of which all things are  modes, the highest thoughts of men hovered during the process by which,  in some measure under extraneous influences, Greek speculation finally  produced Neo-platonism--or, as we might say in the current phraseology  of our time--a restatement of Plato's teaching. Of this school, arising  in the early Christian centuries, some leaders were undoubtedly  Pantheists. But we cannot say this of Plato himself, nor of his master  Socrates. For though these great men were more profoundly interested in  the moral order of the world than in any questions of physical nature,  or even of metaphysical subtleties, they were never given to the kind of  contemplation suggested above in extracts from the Classical Books of  the East, the contemplation which educes the moral ideal from  unreserved subordination of self to the Universe as of the part to the  Whole. Doubtless the inspiration imparted by Socrates to a disciple in  mere intellect his superior, and the resulting moral and religious  suggestions abounding in the Dialogues, did much to impel the current of  religious evolution toward that spiritual aspect of the Infinite All  which fascinated some of the Neo-Platonists, and received its most  splendid exposition from Spinoza. But the conditions imposed by  necessary brevity compel me to pass by those classic names with this  acknowledgment, and to hasten toward the fuller revelation of Pantheism  as a religion.
