It  isn't late, truly.\" Then he turned to their guest. \"Those were very good  stories,\" he said, \"but they were both about girls. Won't you please tell  me one about a boy?\"    \"Very well,\" said the Stranger, \"if your Mother will let me, I will tell  you the story of Perseus and how the great Goddess Athena helped him to  cut off the Gorgon's head with its writhing snaky locks! There's a story  for you! And if you don't believe it is true, some day, when you go  to Athens with your Father, you can see the Gorgon's head, snakes and  all, on the breastplate of the Goddess Athena, where she has worn it ever  since.\"    \"Is it the real Gorgon's head?\" asked Dion breathlessly, \"all snakes and  blood and everything?\"    \"No,\" said the Stranger, laughing, \"the blood of the Gorgon dried up long  ago. It is a sculptured head that adorns the breastplate of Athena.\"    Then the Twins and Chloe listened with open mouth and round eyes to  another of the most wonderful stories in the world, while Lydia forgot to  spin and the wine-cup of Melas stood untouched within reach of his hand.  Even Lydia forgot all about time, and when the story was finished, the  moon had already risen and was looking down upon them over the wall.  Lydia pointed to it with her distaff.    \"See, children,\" she said, \"the Goddess Artemis herself has come to light  you to bed. Thank your kind friend and say good-night.\"          III    THE SHEPHERDS      The next morning Dion was wakened by feeling a cold wet nose wiggling  about in the back of his neck. It was Argos' nose. Dion knew it at once.  He had felt it before.    \"Go away, Argos,\" he said crossly. He pulled the sheepskin coverings of  his bed closer about his ears and turned over for another nap.    But Argos was a good shepherd dog and he knew that his first work that  morning was to round up the Twins. So he gamboled about on his four  clumsy paws and barked. Then, seeing that Dion had no intention of  getting up, he seized the sheepskin covers and dragged them to the  floor.    \"Bow-wow,\" he said.    Dion sat up shivering. \"Good dog,\" said Dion, \"go away from here; go wake  Daphne!\"    \"Bow-wow, bow-wow,\" said Argos, and bounded off to Daphne's room to wake  her too.    Dressing took only a minute, for the children each wore but one garment,  and there were no buttons; so, though they were sleepy and their fingers  were cold and clumsy, they appeared in the court while the roosters in  the farm-yard were still crowing and the thrushes in the olive trees were  in the midst of their sunrise song. Chloe had already gone out to feed  the chickens. Lydia was bending over the hearth-fire, and their Father  was just saying good-bye to the Stranger at the door of the court, and  pointing out to him the road to the little seaport town.    \"You will probably find a boat going over to the Piraeus some time  to-day,\" he said, \"and as they usually go early in the morning, it is  well for you to make an early start from here. May Hermes speed you  on your way.\"    \"Farewell,\" said the Stranger, \"and if ever a philosopher can serve a  farmer, you have but to ask in the Piraeus for the home of Anaxagoras. I  thank you for your hospitality,\" and with these words he was gone.    Melas had eaten his breakfast of bread and wine with his guest before  dawn, and was now ready for the day's work in the fields. The slaves of  Pericles were already in the farm-yard, yoking the oxen, milking the  goats, and getting out the tools. There were pleasant early sounds all  about, but the Twins hovered over the hearth-fire, for the morning was  chill; and Dion yawned. Lydia saw him.    \"Come,\" she said briskly, \"wash your faces! That will wake you up, if you  are still sleepy. And then I'll have a bite for you to eat, and some  bread and cheese for you to carry with you to the hills.\"    \"Are we going to the hills?\" asked Dion.    \"Yes,\" said Melas. \"To-day you must watch the sheep. Dromas has to help  me plough the corn-field. You are old enough now to look after the flock  and bring the sheep all safe home again at night. Come, move quickly!  'Still on the sluggard hungry want attends.'\"    \"They were up too late,\" said Lydia. \"If they can't wake up in the  morning they must go to bed very early every night.\"    When Dion and Daphne heard their Mother say that, they became at once  quite lively, and were soon washed and ready for their breakfast, which  was nothing but cold barley-cakes left over from the night before and a  drink of warm goat's milk. When they had eaten it, Daphne put the bread  and cheese which Lydia had wrapped up in a towel for their luncheon in  the front of her dress and they were ready to start.    Melas and Dromas, the shepherd, were waiting for them at the farm-yard  gate when the Twins came bounding out of the back door, Dion with a  little reed pipe in his hand and Daphne carrying a shepherd's crook. The  sheep were huddled together at the gate, waiting to be let out.    \"Be sure you keep good watch of that old black ewe,\" said Dromas to the  Twins as he went to open the gate. \"She is a wanderer. I never saw a  sheep like her. She is always straying off by herself. Quarrelsome too.  Argos knows she has to be watched more than the others, and sometimes  when she goes off by herself and he goes after her, she just puts her  head down and butts at him like an old goat The wolves will get her one  of these days, as sure as my name is Dromas.\"    \"Are there wolves in the hills?\" asked Daphne.    \"Maybe a few,\" answered Dromas, \"but they don't usually come round when  they see the flock together, and a good dog along. You needn't be  afraid.\"    \"I'm not afraid of anything,\" said Daphne proudly, and then the gate was  opened, the sheep crowded through, and Dion and Daphne with Argos fell in  behind the flock, and away they went toward the hills, to the music of  Dion's pipe, the bleating of the sheep, and the tinkling of their bells.    The children followed the cart-path westward for some distance, and then  left it to drive the flock up the southern slope of a rocky high hill,  where the grass was already quite green in places and there was good  pasture for the sheep. It was still so early in the morning that the sun  threw long, long shadows before them, when they reached the hill pasture,  though they were then two miles from home. The pasture was a lonely  place. Even from the hill-tops there were no houses or villages to be  seen. Far, far away toward the east they could see the olive and fig  trees around their own house. On the western horizon there was a glimpse  of blue sea. In a field nearer they could barely make out two brown  specks moving slowly back and forth. They were oxen, and Dromas was  ploughing with them. It was so still that the children could plainly  hear the breathing of the sheep as they cropped the grass, and the ripple  of the little stream which spread out into a shallow river and watered  the valley below.    The hillside was bare except for shrubs and a few trees, but there were  wonderful places to play among the rocks. Dion proposed that they play  robber cave in a hollow place between two large boulders; but as he  insisted on being the robber, and Daphne wouldn't play if she couldn't be  the robber half the time, that game had to be given up.    Then Daphne said, \"Come on! Let's play Apollo and Daphne! I'm Daphne  anyway, and I can run like the wind. You can be Apollo, only I know you  can't catch me! I can run so fast that even the real Apollo couldn't  catch me!\"    Dion looked scared.    \"Don't you know the Gods are all about us, only we can't see them?\" he  demanded. \"Apollo may have heard what you said, and if he should take a  notion to punish you for bragging, I guess you'd be sorry. Maybe he'll  turn you into a tree just like the other Daphne.\"    \"Pooh,\" said Daphne. \"I'm not afraid. I should think the Gods wouldn't  have time to listen to everything little girls say! They can't be very  busy if they do.\"    Dion was horrified. \"That's a wicked thing to say,\" he said. \"You must  never speak that way of the Gods. Oh dear! This is bound to be an unlucky  day. This morning when Argos woke me, I was having a bad dream! That's a  very bad sign.\"    \"It's a sign you ate too much last night,\" said Daphne. She said it very  boldly, but really she was beginning to feel a little frightened too, for  every one she knew believed in such signs and omens.    \"Come along out of this place, anyway,\" said Dion. \"Let's go somewhere  else and play. Let's go to the brook.\"    The two children came out of their cave between the rocks and started  toward the little stream, which was hidden from them by bushes. The sheep  were all grazing contentedly along the hillside, the old black ewe  browsing in the very middle of the flock. Argos was sitting on the  hill-top in the sunshine, watching them, with his tongue hanging  out. The sun was now quite high in the sky and the day was warm. The  children paddled in the water and built a dam, and sent fleets of leaves  down the stream, and played knuckle-bones on a flat rock beside it, until  at last they were hungry, and then they ate their bread and cheese.    When they had finished the last crumb, Daphne curled herself up on the  flat rock with her head on her arm.    \"I'm so sleepy,\" she said. \"I can't keep awake another minute.\"    You see, they had been up ever so many hours then, and the sunshine was  very warm, and the bees buzzed so drowsily in the sunshine!    \"You and Argos watch the sheep,\" she begged, and was asleep before you  could say Jack Robinson.    Dion"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9976"],[0,"Hernani (#4)"],[1,"we find what we mean when we say he was a  Romanticist. I have heard one definition of the term as applied to  French literature, which said that the essence of Classicism was the  seeking of material in the life of Greece and Rome, and that the  essence of Romanticism was the seeking of material in the life of the  Middle Ages. The true definition, I think, however, is this, if any be  possible: Classicism in literature consists in limiting the choice of  a writer within a certain range of special terms and special ideas,  these terms and these ideas being such as the best authors of the  past have considered beautiful and appropriate. Romanticism is the  theory--a more generous one--which would permit and encourage a writer  to look for his material and his terms among thoughts and expressions  more common in everyday experience, with large freedom of choice. As  a matter of fact, the poet who is no longer bound by the examples  of Racine and Voltaire will naturally turn to the Middle Ages for  inspiration and material, because Racine and Voltaire have nearly  exhausted the resources of Greece and Rome.    It would be foolish to take pride in the discovery, for so much has  been written on this subject that surely some one has expressed my  idea long ago; but I do think that the whole question of Classicism,  and the thing itself, sprang almost entirely from Racine. At any rate  they are purely French in origin. The old stupid German Classicism  which Lessing demolished, the eighteenth-century English Classicism  which Scott and Wordsworth demolished, both had their source in  France. And in France Racine ruled supreme. He built his tragedies  after a severe pattern, and made them very beautiful, but wholly  artificial. People liked them, in that stiff and conventional age,  and were far enough from investigating whether they and the dramas of  Sophocles and Seneca were in truth built on the same plan. They took  that for granted. Henceforth to their minds there was only one way  of making a tragedy: it must not violate the three unities, of time,  place, and action; it must deal exclusively with exalted, heroic, and  terrible emotions; it must contain only poetical expressions; it must  be composed in Alexandrine couplets, with certain minor points of  agreement with the versification of Racine. In short, a writer of  tragedy must think like Racine and rhyme like Racine, and, above all,  he must never under any circumstances employ a term or indicate an  action which might be called vulgar. From France the fashion spread  all over Europe. It affected Italy, even down to Alfieri, who at the  end of the last century was hampered by this spirit of obedience to  Racine. It made English literature of the eighteenth century what it  was, and kept it from being what it might have been. Her acceptance of  this theory was one of the reasons why Germany had no literature of  great account from the time of Luther and Hans Sachs to the day of  brave old Lessing, who was the first man of consequence to see what  was the matter, and to set to work remedying it by destructive  criticism and constructive example. If it is the glory of Germany that  her Lessing was the sharpest-eyed man in Europe and the first person  sound enough, independent enough, blunt enough, and skilful enough  to change the fashion; to us of English speech belongs the pride of  saying that it was back to Shakespeare's large humanity that the  reformers turned. For Shakespeare is the great Romanticist. It was in  Shakespeare that Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller, and the later German  Romanticists, whether as critics or translators or poets, studied  literary art. The Germans Tieck and Schlegel and Herder and von Arnim,  justly celebrated as students of mediaeval literature and as original  producers, were pre-eminently Shakespearean scholars. And now the  French make a great stir of self-gratulation when, as late as 1830,  one of their own poets falls into line and discovers that Shakespeare,  and not Racine, had defined the true boundaries of the tragedian's  art.    Racine tolerated no mingling of the comic and the tragic, as if  laughter never followed tears. Shakespeare constantly mingles them.  Racine would have been horrified at the thought of descending  occasionally to prose, or introducing real songs (the choruses in  «Esther» are hardly of that character) in tragedy. Shakespeare, better  acquainted with this mad, sweet, awful world of ours, is no more  afraid of sudden contrasts than Nature is herself. Racine could never  have brought himself to say «handkerchief» in a tragedy. Shakespeare  does not say that Othello demands of Desdemona a quadrangular tissue  of snowiest cambric, but comes plump out with the word, and it wrecked  Alfred de Vigny's French translation of «Othello» when it was first  performed in Paris, in 1829, and the actor uttered the unhappy word  _mouchoir_.    I do not mean to imply that Victor Hugo would not have emancipated  himself from the thraldom of Racine had he never read our Shakespeare.  He would doubtless have felt cramped, and have sought room for  expansion. He would doubtless have done what he did do, in one  respect, and that is, have turned to mediaeval and later European  history for the inspiration of novels such as «Notre Dame de Paris»,  of plays like «Hernani» and «Ruy Blas», and of a number of his lyrics.  The Germans had already set him an example in the matter of utilizing  folklore and the mediaeval epics and mediaeval history. The brothers  Grimm, those quiet, indefatigable giants, had opened up in Germany a  wonderful mine, not only for philological research, but of poetical  inspiration. Since the days when Goethe helped himself so nobly in the  old German storehouse, drawing thence his best dramatic product,  from «Götz von Berlichingen» to «Faust»; and Schiller even more  abundantly,--since the days of these great men no German poet except  Richard Wagner has availed himself of these riches to make a really  great art-work, such as Tennyson has done with the Arthurian romances  and William Morris with the Norse sagas.    We have seen that the conservative reaction, represented by  Chateaubriand, Lamartine, Lamennais, and Hugo, lasted from 1815 to  1830, and that the new spirit, of Romanticism, which had been working  all along, finally became dominant then. The political revolution of  1830, often called the Revolution of July, had dethroned Charles X,  and brought in, with a more liberal constitution, Louis Philippe,  a prince of the house of Orleans. This event proved to be a great  stimulus to literary activity and a guarantee of literary freedom. It  went far towards destroying the expectation of reviving a state of  society and a tone of thought modelled after seventeenth-century life.  It weakened the monarchical tendency altogether, for it divided the  hopes of conservatives and proved that the Bourbons were not the only  possible kings of France, but that many monarchists would take a king  wherever they could get him. As is usual, and not in politics merely,  but in all combinations of human effort where supremacy must be  maintained by compromise, the unsuccessful minority, the hungry  opposition, was freer from division, more single in aim, and purer in  method, than the party in power. There is sometimes no party tonic  like defeat, and nothing is so recuperative as retirement for a  season. So then after fifteen years of invigorating rest, the  republican party was more capable in 1830 than in 1815 of inspiring  the enthusiasm of men who desired well for their country. It had been  so far purified that a young poet like Hugo might be attracted towards  it as to the saving remnant of his people. His drift in the direction  of republicanism was hastened by the fact that his next two dramas,  «Marion De Lorme», 1831, and «Le Roi s'amuse», 1832, were kept from  being performed by ministerial order, because they displayed two  revered kings of France, Louis XIII and Francis I as the shallow,  pleasure-loving men they were.    A new era for French literature began in 1830. We are justified in  saying this, because the great names of the former decade had lost  their brilliancy, and another set of writers began to be celebrated  and to be looked upon as establishing the tone of thought. The  character of the product, too, is different. There was a larger  freedom in the choice and treatment of subjects, the literatures of  England and Germany were being studied and translated. For the first  time, also, was there in France any widespread appreciation of Dante.  The fact I wish to establish is merely that the spirit had completely  changed, and no argument beyond the evidence of our senses is  necessary.    Pursuing still our old method of investigation, if we want to know  what the new spirit was, we must first inquire who were the prominent  men that breathed it, and then possibly attempt a definition. As  Chateaubriand, Lamartine, and Lamennais set the tone in 1815, so Hugo  with his friends and others of the same free spirit did in 1830. About  this powerful, enthusiastic man and his cultivated young wife, in  their simple home, there gathered a number of literary men and women,  who were called the _cenacle_ or symposium. They, with other persons  whom their influence touched, had a common tendency, which in the case  of some was clearly enough defined to be called a common conscious  purpose. The German poet Heine was living in Paris at that time, and  we know very well what object he set before his eyes. Matthew Arnold,  in his fine essay on Heinrich Heine, quotes the great singer's own  words, and makes them the text of an illuminating criticism. They  represent exactly the sentiment of Hugo and his friends at that time.  Hear them: «I know not if I deserve that a laurel-wreath should one  day be laid on my coffin. Poetry, dearly as I have loved it, has  always been to me but"]]]
