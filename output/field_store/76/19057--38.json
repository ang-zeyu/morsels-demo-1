I felt very much off colour all the rest of the day, and I had such  a bad night of it that I made up my mind next morning to look the  hopelessness square in the face and live the thing down.      It was the evening before Anniversary Day. Jack and I had put in a good  day's work to get the job finished, and Jack was having a smoke and a  yarn with the chaps before he started home. We sat on an old log along  by the fence at the back of the house. There was Jimmy Nowlett the  bullock-driver, and long Dave Regan the drover, and big Jim Bullock the  fencer, and one or two others. Mary and the station girls and one or  two visitors were sitting under the old verandah. The Jackaroo was  there too, so I felt happy. It was the girls who used to bring the chaps  hanging round. They were getting up a dance party for Anniversary night.  Along in the evening another chap came riding up to the station: he was  a big shearer, a dark, handsome fellow, who looked like a gipsy: it was  reckoned that there was foreign blood in him. He went by the name of  Romany. He was supposed to be shook after Mary too. He had the nastiest  temper and the best violin in the district, and the chaps put up with  him a lot because they wanted him to play at Bush dances. The moon had  risen over Pine Ridge, but it was dusky where we were. We saw Romany  loom up, riding in from the gate; he rode round the end of the  coach-house and across towards where we were--I suppose he was going to  tie up his horse at the fence; but about half-way across the grass he  disappeared. It struck me that there was something peculiar about the  way he got down, and I heard a sound like a horse stumbling.    'What the hell's Romany trying to do?' said Jimmy Nowlett. 'He couldn't  have fell off his horse--or else he's drunk.'    A couple of chaps got up and went to see. Then there was that waiting,  mysterious silence that comes when something happens in the dark and  nobody knows what it is. I went over, and the thing dawned on me. I'd  stretched a wire clothes-line across there during the day, and had  forgotten all about it for the moment. Romany had no idea of the line,  and, as he rode up, it caught him on a level with his elbows and scraped  him off his horse. He was sitting on the grass, swearing in a surprised  voice, and the horse looked surprised too. Romany wasn't hurt, but the  sudden shock had spoilt his temper. He wanted to know who'd put up that  bloody line. He came over and sat on the log. The chaps smoked a while.    'What did you git down so sudden for, Romany?' asked Jim Bullock  presently. 'Did you hurt yerself on the pommel?'    'Why didn't you ask the horse to go round?' asked Dave Regan.    'I'd only like to know who put up that bleeding wire!' growled Romany.    'Well,' said Jimmy Nowlett, 'if we'd put up a sign to beware of the line  you couldn't have seen it in the dark.'    'Unless it was a transparency with a candle behind it,' said Dave Regan.  'But why didn't you get down on one end, Romany, instead of all along?  It wouldn't have jolted yer so much.'    All this with the Bush drawl, and between the puffs of their pipes.  But I didn't take any interest in it. I was brooding over Mary and the  Jackaroo.    'I've heard of men getting down over their horse's head,' said  Dave presently, in a reflective sort of way--'in fact I've done it  myself--but I never saw a man get off backwards over his horse's rump.'    But they saw that Romany was getting nasty, and they wanted him to play  the fiddle next night, so they dropped it.    Mary was singing an old song. I always thought she had a sweet voice,  and I'd have enjoyed it if that damned Jackaroo hadn't been listening  too. We listened in silence until she'd finished.    'That gal's got a nice voice,' said Jimmy Nowlett.    'Nice voice!' snarled Romany, who'd been waiting for a chance to be  nasty. 'Why, I've heard a tom-cat sing better.'    I moved, and Jack, he was sitting next me, nudged me to keep quiet. The  chaps didn't like Romany's talk about 'Possum at all. They were all fond  of her: she wasn't a pet or a tomboy, for she wasn't built that way,  but they were fond of her in such a way that they didn't like to hear  anything said about her. They said nothing for a while, but it meant a  lot. Perhaps the single men didn't care to speak for fear that it would  be said that they were gone on Mary. But presently Jimmy Nowlett gave a  big puff at his pipe and spoke--    'I suppose you got bit too in that quarter, Romany?'    'Oh, she tried it on, but it didn't go,' said Romany. 'I've met her sort  before. She's setting her cap at that Jackaroo now. Some girls will run  after anything with trousers on,' and he stood up.    Jack Barnes must have felt what was coming, for he grabbed my arm, and  whispered, 'Sit still, Joe, damn you! He's too good for you!' but I was  on my feet and facing Romany as if a giant hand had reached down and  wrenched me off the log and set me there.    'You're a damned crawler, Romany!' I said.    Little Jimmy Nowlett was between us and the other fellows round us  before a blow got home. 'Hold on, you damned fools!' they said. 'Keep  quiet till we get away from the house!' There was a little clear flat  down by the river and plenty of light there, so we decided to go down  there and have it out.    Now I never was a fighting man; I'd never learnt to use my hands. I  scarcely knew how to put them up. Jack often wanted to teach me, but I  wouldn't bother about it. He'd say, 'You'll get into a fight some day,  Joe, or out of one, and shame me;' but I hadn't the patience to learn.  He'd wanted me to take lessons at the station after work, but he used to  get excited, and I didn't want Mary to see him knocking me about. Before  he was married Jack was always getting into fights--he generally tackled  a better man and got a hiding; but he didn't seem to care so long as  he made a good show--though he used to explain the thing away from a  scientific point of view for weeks after. To tell the truth, I had a  horror of fighting; I had a horror of being marked about the face; I  think I'd sooner stand off and fight a man with revolvers than fight him  with fists; and then I think I would say, last thing, 'Don't shoot me  in the face!' Then again I hated the idea of hitting a man. It seemed  brutal to me. I was too sensitive and sentimental, and that was what  the matter was. Jack seemed very serious on it as we walked down to the  river, and he couldn't help hanging out blue lights.    'Why didn't you let me teach you to use your hands?' he said. 'The  only chance now is that Romany can't fight after all. If you'd waited  a minute I'd have been at him.' We were a bit behind the rest, and Jack  started giving me points about lefts and rights, and 'half-arms', and  that sort of thing. 'He's left-handed, and that's the worst of it,' said  Jack. 'You must only make as good a show as you can, and one of us will  take him on afterwards.'    But I just heard him and that was all. It was to be my first fight since  I was a boy, but, somehow, I felt cool about it--sort of dulled. If the  chaps had known all they would have set me down as a cur. I thought of  that, but it didn't make any difference with me then; I knew it was a  thing they couldn't understand. I knew I was reckoned pretty soft. But  I knew one thing that they didn't know. I knew that it was going to be  a fight to a finish, one way or the other. I had more brains and  imagination than the rest put together, and I suppose that that was the  real cause of most of my trouble. I kept saying to myself, 'You'll have  to go through with it now, Joe, old man! It's the turning-point of your  life.' If I won the fight, I'd set to work and win Mary; if I lost, I'd  leave the district for ever. A man thinks a lot in a flash sometimes; I  used to get excited over little things, because of the very paltriness  of them, but I was mostly cool in a crisis--Jack was the reverse. I  looked ahead: I wouldn't be able to marry a girl who could look back and  remember when her husband was beaten by another man--no matter what sort  of brute the other man was.    I never in my life felt so cool about a thing. Jack kept whispering  instructions, and showing with his hands, up to the last moment, but it  was all lost on me.    Looking back, I think there was a bit of romance about it: Mary singing  under the vines to amuse a Jackaroo dude, and a coward going down to the  river in the moonlight to fight for her.    It was very quiet in the little moonlit flat by the river. We took off  our coats and were ready. There was no swearing or barracking. It seemed  an understood thing with the men that if I went out first round Jack  would fight Romany; and if Jack knocked him out somebody else would  fight Jack to square matters. Jim Bullock wouldn't mind obliging for  one; he was a mate of Jack's, but he didn't mind who he fought so long  as it was for the sake of fair play--or 'peace and quietness', as he  said. Jim was very good-natured. He backed Romany, and of course Jack  backed me.    As far as I could see, all Romany knew about fighting was to jerk one  arm up in front of his face and duck his head by way of a feint, and  then rush and lunge out. But he had the weight and strength and length  of reach, and my first lesson was a very short one. I went down early  in the round. But it did me good; the blow and the look I'd seen  in Romany's eyes knocked all the sentiment out of me. Jack said  nothing,--he seemed to regard it as a hopeless job from the first.  Next round I tried to remember some things Jack had told me, and made a  better show, but I went down in the end.    I felt Jack breathing quick and trembling as he lifted me up.    'How are you, Joe?' he whispered.    'I'm all right,' I said.    'It's all right,' whispered Jack in a voice as if I was going to be  hanged, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10366"],[0,"Freedom's Battle (#5)"],[1," wrong notions the Allies still entertain about Caliphate are a  sufficient indication of the effects of the work of this official  delegation. The result of these wrong notions is the present settlement  and this unjust settlement will unsettle the world. They know not  what they do.      TURKISH PEACE TERMS    The question of question to-day is the Khilafat question, otherwise  known as that of the Turkish peace terms. His Excellency the Viceroy  deserves our thanks for receiving the joint deputation even at this late  hour, especially when he was busy preparing to receive the head of the  different provinces. His Excellency must be thanked for the unfailing  courtesy with which he received the deputation and the courteous  language in which his reply was couched. But mere courtesy, valuable as  it is at all times, never so valuable as at this, is not enough at this  critical moment. 'Sweet words butter no parsnips' is a proverb more  applicable to-day than ever before. Behind the courtesy there was the  determination to punish Turkey. Punishment of Turkey is a thing which  Muslim sentiment cannot tolerate for a moment. Muslim soldiers are as  responsible for the result of the war as any others. It was to appease  them that Mr. Asquith said when Turkey decided to join the Central  Powers that the British Government had no designs on Turkey and that His  Majesty's Government would never think of punishing the Sultan for the  misdeeds of the Turkish Committee. Examined by that standard the  Viceregal reply is not only disappointing but it is a fall from truth  and justice.    What is this British Empire? It is as much Mahomedan and Hindu as it is  Christian. Its religious neutrality is not a virtue, or if it is, it is  a virtue of necessity. Such a mighty Empire could not be held together  on any other terms. British ministers are therefore bound to protect  Mahomedan interests as any other. Indeed as the Muslim rejoinder says,  they are bound to make the cause their own. What is the use of His  Excellency having presented the Muslim claim before the Conference? If  the cause is lost the Mahomedans will be entitled to think that Britain  did not do her duty by them. And the Viceregal reply confirms the view.  When His Excellency says that Turkey must suffer for her having joined  the Central Powers he but expresses the opinion of British ministers.  We hope, therefore, with the framers of the Muslim rejoinder that His  Majesty's ministers will mend the mistakes if any have been committed  and secure a settlement that would satisfy Mahomedan sentiment.    What does the sentiment demand? The preservation of the Khilafat with  such guarantee as may be necessary for the protection of the interests  of the non-Muslim races living under Turkish rule and the Khalif's  control over Arabia and the Holy Places with such arrangement as may be  required for guaranteeing Arab self-rule, should the Arabs desire it. It  is hardly possible to state the claim more fairly than has been done. It  is a claim backed by justice, by the declarations of British ministers  and by the unanimous Hindu and Muslim opinion. It would be midsummer  madness to reject or whittle down a claim so backed.      THE SUZERAINTY OVER ARABIA       \"As I told you in my last letter I think Mr. Gandhi has made a     serious mistake in the Kailafat business. The Indian Mahomedans base     their demand on the assertion that their religion requires the     Turkish rule over Arabia: but when they have against them in this     matter, the Arabs themselves, it is impossible to regard the theory     of the Indian Mahomedans as essential to Islam. After all if the     Arabs do not represent Islam, who does? It is as if the German Roman     Catholics made a demand in the name of Roman Catholicism with Rome     and the Italians making a contrary demand. But even if the religion     of the Indian Mahomedans did require that Turkish rule should be     imposed upon the Arabs against their will, one could not, now-a-days,     recognise as a really religious demand, one which required the     continued oppression of one people by another. When an assurance was     given at the beginning of the war to the Indian Mahomedans that the     Mahomedan religion would be respected, that could never have meant     that a temporal sovereignty which violated the principles of     self-determination would be upheld. We could not now stand by and see     the Turks re-conquer the Arabs (for the Arabs would certainly fight     against them) without grossly betraying the Arabs to whom we have     given pledges. It is not true that the Arab hostility to the Turks     was due simply to European suggestion. No doubt, during the war we     availed ourselves of the Arab hostility to the Turks to get another     ally, but the hostility had existed long before the war. The     Non-Turkish Mahomedan subjects of the Sultan in general wanted to get     rid of his rule. It is the Indian Mahomedans who have no experience     of that rule who want to impose it on others. As a matter of fact the     idea of any restoration of Turkish rule in Syria or Arabia, seems so     remote from all possibilities that to discuss it seems like     discussing a restoration of the Holy Roman Empire. I cannot conceive     what series of events could bring it about. The Indian Mahomedans     certainly could not march into Arabia themselves and conquer the     Arabs for the Sultan. And no amount of agitation and trouble in India     would ever induce England to put back Turkish rule in Arabia. In this     matter it is not English Imperialism which the Indian Mahomedans are     up against, but the mass of English Liberal and Humanitarian opinion,     the mass of the better opinion of England, which wants     self-determination to go forward in India. Supposing the Indian     Mahomedans could stir up an agitation so violent in India as to sever     the connection between India and the British Crown, still they would     not be any nearer to their purpose. For to-day they do have     considerable influence on British world-policy. Even if in this     matter of the Turkish question their influence has not been     sufficient to turn the scale against the very heavy weights on the     other side, it has weighed in the scale. But apart from the British     connection, Indian Mahomedans would have no influence at all outside     India. They would not count for more in world politics than the     Mahomedans of China. I think it is likely (apart from the pressure     of America on the other side. I should say certain) that the     influence of the Indian Mahomedans may at any rate avail to keep the     Sultan in Constantinople. But I doubt whether they will gain any     advantage by doing so. For a Turkey cut down to the Turkish parts of     Asia-Minor, Constantinople would be a very inconvenient capital. I     think its inconvenience would more than outweigh the sentimental     gratification of keeping up a phantom of the old Ottoman Empire. But     if the Indian Mahomedans want the Sultan to retain his place in     Constantinople I think the assurances given officially by the Viceroy     in India now binds us to insist on his remaining there and I think he     will remain there in spite of America.\"    This is an extract, from the letter of an Englishman enjoying a position  in Great Britain, to a friend in India. It is a typical letter, sober,  honest, to the point and put in such graceful language that whilst it  challenges you, it commands your respect by its very gracefulness. But  it is just this attitude based upon insufficient or false information  which has ruined many a cause in the British Isles. The superficiality,  the one-sidedness the inaccuracy and often even dishonesty that have  crept into modern journalism, continuously mislead honest men who want  to see nothing but justice done. Then there are always interested  groups whose business it is to serve their ends by means of faul or  food. And the honest Englishman wishing to vote for justice but swayed  by conflicting opinions and dominated by distorted versions, often ends  by becoming an instrument of injustice.    The writer of the letter quoted above has built up convincing argument  on imaginary data. He has successfully shown that the Mahomedan case, as  it has been presented to him, is a rotten case. In India, where it is  not quite easy to distort facts about the Khilafat, English friends  admit the utter justice of the Indian-Mahomedan claim. But they plead  helplessness and tell us that the Government of India and Mr. Montagu  have done all it was humanly possible for them to do. And if now the  judgment goes against Islam, Indian Mahomedans should resign themselves  to it. This extraordinary state of things would not be possible except  under this modern rush and preoccupations of all responsible people.    Let us for a moment examine the case as it has been imagined by the  writer. He suggests that Indian Mahomedans want Turkish rule in Arabia  in spite of the opposition of the Arabs themselves, and that, if the  Arabs do not want Turkish rule, the writer argues, no false religions  sentiment can be permitted to interfere with self-determination of the  Arabs when India herself has been pleading for that very status. Now the  fact is that the Mahomedans, as is known to everybody who has at all  studied the case, have never asked for Turkish rule in Arabia in  opposition to the Arabs. On the contrary, they have said that they have  no intention of resisting Arabian self-government. All they ask for is  Turkish suzerainty over Arabia which would guarantee complete self-rule  for the Arabs. They want Khalif's control of the Holy Places of Islam.  In other words they ask for nothing more than what was guaranteed by Mr.  Lloyd George and on the strength of which guarantee Mahomedan soldiers  split their blood on behalf of the Allied Powers.
