[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],[0,"The Fern Lover's Companion (#5)"],[1,"ins, Gaspe County, Quebec, 1906) (From the Gray  Herbarium)]    The fern is not hard to cultivate if allowed sufficient moisture and shade.  Along with the ostrich fern it makes a most excellent combination in a fern  border.    Var. ALEUTICUM, or Alpine Maidenhair. A beautiful northern form especially  abundant on the high tableland of the Gaspe Peninsula, Quebec, where it is  said to cover hundreds of acres. In the east it is often dwarfed--six  to ten inches high, growing in tufts with stout rootstocks, having the  pinnules finely toothed instead of rounded and the indusia often lunate,  rarely twice as long as broad. (Fernald in _Rhodora_, November, 1905.) Also  found in northern Vermont, and to the northwestward.    (2) THE VENUS-HAIR FERN. _Adiantum Capillus-Veneris_    Fronds with a continuous main rachis, ovate-lanceolate, twice pinnate  below. Pinnules, fan-shaped on slender, black stalks, long, deeply and  irregularly incised. Veins extending from the base of the pinnules like the  ribs of a fan.    [Illustration: Venus Hair Fern. _Adiantum Capillus-Veneris_]    While our common maidenhair is a northern fern, the Venus-hair Fern is  confined to the southern states. It is rarely found as far north as  Virginia, where it meets, but scarcely overlaps its sister fern. The  medicinal properties of _Adiantum pedatum_ were earlier ascribed to the  more southern species, which is common in Great Britain, but, like many  another old remedy, \"the syrup of capillaire\" is long since defunct.        3. CLIFF BRAKES. _Pellaea_    Sporangia borne on the upper part of the free veins inside the margins, in  dot-like masses, but may run together, as in the continuous fruiting line  of the bracken. Indusium formed of the reflexed margins of the fertile  segments which are more or less membranous. (Pellaea, from the Greek  _pellos_, meaning dusky, in allusion to the dark stipes.)    (1) PURPLE CLIFF BRAKE. _Pellaea atropurpurea_    Stipes dark purple or reddish-brown, polished and decidedly hairy and  harsh to the touch, at least on one side. Fronds coriaceous, pale, simply  pinnate, or bipinnate below; the divisions broadly linear or oblong, or  the sterile sometimes oval, chiefly entire, somewhat heart-shaped, or  else truncate at the stalked base. Veins about twice forked. Basal scales  extending into long, slender tips, colorless or yellow.    [Illustration: Purple Cliff Brake. _Pellaea atropurpurea_]    Another name is \"the winter brake,\" as its fronds remain green throughout  the winter, especially in its more southern ranges. It grows on rocky  ledges with a preference for limestone, and often in full sun. In large and  mature fronds its pinnae are apt to be extremely irregular. While its stipes  are purplish, its leaves are bluish-green, and its scales light-brown or  yellow. Strange to say, this brake of the cliffs thrives in cultivation.  Woolson says of it, \"This fern is interesting and valuable. It is not only  beautiful in design, but unique in color, a dark blue-green emphasizing  all the varying tints about it--a first-class fern for indoor winter  cultivation. It is a rapid grower, flourishing but a few feet from coal  fire or radiator, in a north or south window. It quickly forgives neglect,  and if allowed to dry up out of doors or indoors, recovers in due time when  put in a moist atmosphere. It makes but one imperative demand, and that is  the privilege of standing still. Overzealous culturists usually like to  turn things around, but revolving cliffs are not in the natural order of  things. The slender black stipes are very susceptible to changes of light  and warped and twisted fronds result.\"    Dry, calcareous rocks, southern New England and westward. Rare. Var.  _cristata_ has forked pinnae somewhat crowded toward the summit of the  frond. Missouri.      (2) SMOOTH CLIFF BRAKE    _Pellaea glabella. Pellaea atropurpurea_, var. _Bushii_    Naked with a few, scattered, spreading hairs, smooth surface and dark  polished stipes. Rhizome short with membranous, orange or brown scales  having a few bluntish teeth on each edge. Pinnae sub-opposite, divergent,  narrowly oblong, obtuse; base truncate, cordate or clasping, occasionally  auricled; lower pinnae often with orbicular or cordate pinnules. Sterile  pinnae broader, bluish or greenish glaucous above, often crowded to  overlapping. The smooth cliff brake has a decidedly northern range, growing  from northern Vermont to Missouri, and northwestward, but found rarely, if  at all, in southern New England.    [Illustration: Dense Cliff Brake. _Cryptogramma densa_ (From Waters's  \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]      (3) DENSE CLIFF BRAKE    _Cryptogramma densa. Pellaea densa_    Modern botanists are inclined to place the dense cliff brake and the  slender cliff brake under the genus _Cryptogramma_, which is so nearly like  _Pellaea_ that one hesitates to choose between them. The word Cryptogramma  means in Greek a _hidden line_, alluding to the line of sporangia hidden  beneath the reflexed margin.    The dense cliff brake may be described as follows:    Stipes three to nine inches tall, blades one to three inches,  triangular-ovate, pinnate at the summit, and tripinnate below. Segments  linear, sharp-pointed, mostly fertile, having the margins entire and  recurved, giving the sori the appearance of half-open pods. Sterile  fronds sharply serrate. Stipes in dense tufts (\"_densa_\") slender, wiry,  light-brown.    This rare little fern is a northern species and springs from tiny crevices  in rocks, preferring limestone. Like many other rock-loving species, it  produces spores in abundance, having no other effective means of spreading,  and its fertile fronds are much more numerous than the sterile ones, and  begin to fruit when very small. Gaspe and Mt. Albert in the Province of  Quebec, Grey County, Ontario, and in the far west.      (4) SLENDER CLIFF BRAKE    _Cryptogramma Stelleri. Pellaea gracilis_    Fronds (including stipes) three to six inches long, thin and slender with  few pinnae. The lower pinnae pinnately parted into three to five divisions,  those of the fertile fronds oblong or linear-oblong; those of the sterile,  obovate or ovate, crenulate, decurrent at the base. Confined to limestone  rocks. Quebec and New Brunswick, to Vermont, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and  to the northwest.    [Illustration: Slender Cliff Brake. _Cryptogramma Stelleri_]    We have collected this dainty and attractive little fern on the limestone  cliffs of Mt. Horr, near Willoughby Lake, Vt. It grew in a rocky grotto  whose sides were kept moist by dripping water. How we liked to linger near  its charming abode high on the cliff! And we liked also to speak of it by  its pleasing, simple name, \"Pellaea gracilis,\" now changed for scientific  reasons, but we still like the old name better.      (5) THE ROCK BRAKE. PARSLEY FERN    _Cryptogramma acrostichoides_    Sterile and fertile fronds very dissimilar; segments of the fertile, linear  and pod-like; of the sterile, ovate-oblong, obtuse, and toothed. The plants  spring from crevices of rocks and are from six to eight inches high. Stipes  of the fertile fronds are about twice as long as the sterile, making two  tiers of fronds.    [Illustration: Parsley Fern or Rock Brake. _Cryptogramma acrostichoides_  (California and Oregon) (Herbarium of Geo. E. Davenport)]    The parsley fern is the typical species of the genus _Cryptogramma_. The  indusium is formed of the altered margin of the pinnule, at first reflexed  to the midrib, giving it a pod-like appearance, but at length opening out  flat and exposing the sporangia. Clute, speaking of this fern as \"the rock  brake,\" calls it a border species, as its home is in the far north--Arctic  America to Lake Huron, Lake Superior, Colorado and California.        4. LIP FERNS. _Cheilanthes_    Mostly small southern ferns growing on rocks, pubescent or tomentose with  much divided leaves. Sori at the end of the veins at first small and  roundish, but afterwards more or less confluent. The indusium whitish and  sometimes herbaceous, formed of the reflexed margin of the lobes or of the  whole pinnule. Veins free, but often obscure. Most of the ferns of this  genus grow in dry, exposed situations, where rain is sometimes absent for  weeks and months. For this reason they protect themselves by a covering  of hairs, scales or wool, which hinders the evaporation of water from the  plant by holding a layer of more or less saturated air near the surface of  the frond. (In Greek the word means _lip flower_, alluding to the lip-like  indusia.)    (1) ALABAMA LIP FERN. _Cheilanthes alabamensis_    Fronds smooth, two to ten inches long, lanceolate, bipinnate. Pinnae  numerous, oblong-lanceolate, the lower usually smaller than those above.  Pinnules triangular-oblong, mostly acute, often auricular or lobed at the  base. Indusia pale, membranous and continuous except between the lobes.  Stipes black, slender and tomentose at the base.    [Illustration: Alabama Lip Fern. _Cheilanthes alabamensis_ (From Waters's  \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]    This species of lip fern may be distinguished from all the others within  our limits by its smooth pinnae. On rocks--mountains of Virginia to  Kentucky, and Alabama, and westward to Arizona.    (2) HAIRY LIP FERN. _Cheilanthes lanosa, C. vestita_    [Illustration: Hairy Lip Fern]    Fronds twice pinnate, lanceolate with oblong, pinnatifid pinnules; seven  to fifteen inches tall, slender and rough with rusty, jointed hairs. Pinnae  triangular-ovate, usually distant, the ends of the rounded lobes reflexed  and forming separate involucres which are pushed back by the ripening  sporangia.    This species like the other lip ferns is fond of rocks, springing from  clefts and ledges. While hairy it is much less tomentose than the two  following species. Unlike most of the rock-loving ferns this species is not  partial to limestone, but grows on other rocks as well.

Do you call this a quarrel? Is there any want  of help here? Do you suppose that I am in the world to give _advice_? Of  all occupations which man can pursue, that is the most foolish. Every  man must be his own counsellor, and do what he cannot let alone. If all  go well, let him be happy, let him enjoy his wisdom and his fortune; if  it go ill, I am at hand to do what I can for him. The man who desires to  be rid of an evil knows what he wants; but the man who desires something  better than he has got is stone blind. Yes, yes, laugh as you will, he  is playing blindman's-buff; perhaps he gets hold of something, but the  question is what he has got hold of. Do as you will, it is all one.  Invite your friends to you, or let them be, it is all the same. The most  prudent plans I have seen miscarry, and the most foolish succeed. Don't  split your brains about it; and if, one way or the other, evil comes of  what you settle, don't fret; send for me, and you shall be helped. Till  which time, I am your humble servant.\"    So saying, he sprang on his horse, without waiting the arrival of the  coffee.    \"Here you see,\" said Charlotte, \"the small service a third person can  be, when things are off their balance between two persons closely  connected; we are left, if possible, more confused and more uncertain  than we were.\"    They would both, probably, have continued hesitating some time longer,  had not a letter arrived from the Captain, in reply to Edward's last. He  had made up his mind to accept one of the situations which had been  offered him, although it was not in the least up to his mark. He was to  share the ennui of certain wealthy persons of rank, who depended on his  ability to dissipate it.    Edward's keen glance saw into the whole thing, and he pictured it out in  just, sharp lines.    \"Can we endure to think of our friend in such a position?\" he cried;  \"you cannot be so cruel, Charlotte.\"    \"That strange Mittler is right after all,\" replied Charlotte; \"all such  undertakings are ventures; what will come of them it is impossible to  foresee. New elements introduced among us may be fruitful in fortune or  in misfortune, without our having to take credit to ourselves for one or  the other. I do not feel myself firm enough to oppose you further. Let  us make the experiment; only one thing I will entreat of you--that it be  only for a short time. You must allow me to exert myself more than ever,  to use all my influence among all my connections, to find him some  position which will satisfy him in his own way.\"    Edward poured out the warmest expressions of gratitude. He hastened,  with a light, happy heart, to write off his proposals to his friend.  Charlotte, in a postscript, was to signify her approbation with her own  hand, and unite her own kind entreaties with his. She wrote, with a  rapid pen, pleasantly and affectionately, but yet with a sort of haste  which was not usual with her; and, most unlike herself, she disfigured  the paper at last with a blot of ink, which put her out of temper, and  which she only made worse with her attempts to wipe it away.    Edward laughed at her about it, and, as there was still room, added a  second postscript, that his friend was to see from this symptom the  impatience with which he was expected, and measure the speed at which he  came to them by the haste in which the letter was written.    The messenger was gone; and Edward thought he could not give a more  convincing evidence of his gratitude, than in insisting again and again  that Charlotte should at once send for Ottilie from the school. She said  she would think about it; and, for that evening, induced Edward to join  with her in the enjoyment of a little music. Charlotte played  exceedingly well on the piano, Edward not quite so well on the flute. He  had taken a great deal of pains with it at times; but he was without the  patience, without the perseverance, which are requisite for the  completely successful cultivation of such a talent; consequently, his  part was done unequally, some pieces well, only perhaps too  quickly--while with others he hesitated, not being quite familiar with  them; so that, for any one else, it would have been difficult to have  gone through a duet with him. But Charlotte knew how to manage it. She  held in, or let herself be run away with, and fulfilled in this way the  double part of a skilful conductor and a prudent housewife, who are able  always to keep right on the whole, although particular passages will now  and then fall out of order.          CHAPTER III      The Captain came, having previously written a most sensible letter,  which had entirely quieted Charlotte's apprehensions. So much clearness  about himself, so just an understanding of his own position and the  position of his friends, promised everything which was best and  happiest.    The conversation of the first few hours, as is generally the case with  friends who have not met for a long time, was eager, lively, almost  exhausting. Toward evening, Charlotte proposed a walk to the new  grounds. The Captain was delighted with the spot, and observed every  beauty which had been first brought into sight and made enjoyable by the  new walks. He had a practised eye, and at the same time one easily  satisfied; and although he knew very well what was really valuable, he  never, as so many persons do, made people who were showing him things of  their own uncomfortable, by requiring more than the circumstances  admitted of, or by mentioning anything more perfect, which he remembered  having seen elsewhere.    When they arrived at the summer-house, they found it dressed out for a  holiday, only, indeed, with artificial flowers and evergreens, but with  some pretty bunches of natural corn-ears among them, and other field and  garden fruit, so as to do credit to the taste which had arranged them.    \"Although my husband does not like in general to have his birthday or  christening-day kept,\" Charlotte said, \"he will not object today to  these few ornaments being expended on a treble festival.\"    \"Treble?\" cried Edward.    \"Yes, indeed,\" she replied. \"Our friend's arrival here we are bound to  keep as a festival; and have you never thought, either of you, that this  is the day on which you were both christened? Are you not both named  Otto?\"    The two friends shook hands across the little table.    \"You bring back to my mind,\" Edward said, \"this little link of our  boyish affection. As children, we were both called so; but when we came  to be at school together, it was the cause of much confusion, and I  readily made over to him all my right to the pretty laconic name.\"    \"Wherein you were not altogether so very high-minded,\" said the Captain;  \"for I well remember that the name of Edward had then begun to please  you better, from its attractive sound when spoken by certain pretty  lips.\"    They were now sitting all three round the same table where Charlotte had  spoken so vehemently against their guest's coming to them. Edward, happy  as he was, did not wish to remind his wife of that time; but he could  not help saying, \"There is good room here for one more person.\"    At this moment the notes of a bugle were heard across from the castle.  Full of happy thoughts and feelings as the friends all were together,  the sound fell in among them with a strong force of answering harmony.  They listened silently, each for the moment withdrawing into himself,  and feeling doubly happy in the fair circle of which he formed a part.  The pause was first broken by Edward, who started up and walked out in  front of the summer-house.    \"Our friend must not think,\" he said to Charlotte, \"that this narrow  little valley forms the whole of our domain and possessions. Let us take  him up to the top of the hill, where he can see farther and breathe more  freely.\"    \"For this once, then,\" answered Charlotte, \"we must climb up the old  footpath, which is not too easy. By the next time, I hope my walks and  steps will have been carried right up.\"    And so, among rocks, and shrubs, and bushes, they made their way to the  summit, where they found themselves, not on a level flat, but on a  sloping grassy terrace, running along the ridge of the hill. The  village, with the castle behind it, was out of sight. At the bottom of  the valley, sheets of water were seen spreading out right and left, with  wooded hills rising immediately from their opposite margin, and, at the  end of the upper water, a wall of sharp, precipitous rocks directly  overhanging it, their huge forms reflected in its level surface. In the  hollow of the ravine, where a considerable brook ran into the lake, lay  a mill, half hidden among the trees, a sweetly retired spot, most  beautifully surrounded; and through the entire semicircle, over which  the view extended, ran an endless variety of hills and valleys, copse  and forest, the early green of which promised the near approach of a  luxuriant clothing of foliage. In many places particular groups of trees  caught the eye; and especially a cluster of planes and poplars directly  at the spectator's feet, close to the edge of the centre lake. They were  at their full growth, and they stood there, spreading out their boughs  all around them, in fresh and luxuriant strength.    To these Edward called his friend's attention.    \"I myself planted them,\" he cried, \"when I was a boy. They were small  trees which I rescued when my father was laying out the new part of the  great castle garden, and in the middle of one summer had rooted them  out. This year you will no doubt see them show their gratitude in a  fresh set of shoots.\"    They returned to the castle in high spirits, and mutually pleased with  each other. To the guest was"]]]
