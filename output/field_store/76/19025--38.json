[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#4)"],[1," light the candle and the action interested the Ork  very much.    \"Light,\" it said, somewhat nervously, \"is valuable in a hole of this  sort. The candle is not dangerous, I hope?\"    \"Sometimes it burns your fingers,\" answered Trot, \"but that's about the  worst it can do--'cept to blow out when you don't want it to.\"    Cap'n Bill shielded the flame with his hand and crept into the hole. It  wasn't any too big for a grown man, but after he had crawled a few feet  it grew larger.  Trot came close behind him and then the Ork followed.    \"Seems like a reg'lar tunnel,\" muttered the sailor-man, who was  creeping along awkwardly because of his wooden leg. The rocks, too,  hurt his knees.    For nearly half an hour the three moved slowly along the tunnel, which  made many twists and turns and sometimes slanted downward and sometimes  upward. Finally Cap'n Bill stopped short, with an exclamation of  disappointment, and held the flickering candle far ahead to light the  scene.    \"What's wrong?\" demanded Trot, who could see nothing because the  sailor's form completely filled the hole.    \"Why, we've come to the end of our travels, I guess,\" he replied.    \"Is the hole blocked?\" inquired the Ork.    \"No; it's wuss nor that,\" replied Cap'n Bill sadly. \"I'm on the edge of  a precipice. Wait a minute an' I'll move along and let you see for  yourselves. Be careful, Trot, not to fall.\"    Then he crept forward a little and moved to one side, holding the  candle so that the girl could see to follow him. The Ork came next and  now all three knelt on a narrow ledge of rock which dropped straight  away and left a huge black space which the tiny flame of the candle  could not illuminate.    \"H-m!\" said the Ork, peering over the edge; \"this doesn't look very  promising, I'll admit. But let me take your candle, and I'll fly down  and see what's below us.\"    \"Aren't you afraid?\" asked Trot.    \"Certainly I'm afraid,\" responded the Ork. \"But if we intend to escape  we can't stay on this shelf forever. So, as I notice you poor creatures  cannot fly, it is my duty to explore the place for you.\"    Cap'n Bill handed the Ork the candle, which had now burned to about  half its length. The Ork took it in one claw rather cautiously and then  tipped its body forward and slipped over the edge. They heard a queer  buzzing sound, as the tail revolved, and a brisk flapping of the  peculiar wings, but they were more interested just then in following  with their eyes the tiny speck of light which marked the location of  the candle. This light first made a great circle, then dropped slowly  downward and suddenly was extinguished, leaving everything before them  black as ink.    \"Hi, there! How did that happen?\" cried the Ork.    \"It blew out, I guess,\" shouted Cap'n Bill. \"Fetch it here.\"    \"I can't see where you are,\" said the Ork.    So Cap'n Bill got out another candle and lighted it, and its flame  enabled the Ork to fly back to them. It alighted on the edge and held  out the bit of candle.    \"What made it stop burning?\" asked the creature.    \"The wind,\" said Trot. \"You must be more careful, this time.\"    \"What's the place like?\" inquired Cap'n Bill.    \"I don't know, yet; but there must be a bottom to it, so I'll try to  find it.\"    With this the Ork started out again and this time sank downward more  slowly. Down, down, down it went, till the candle was a mere spark, and  then it headed away to the left and Trot and Cap'n Bill lost all sight  of it.    In a few minutes, however, they saw the spark of light again, and as  the sailor still held the second lighted candle the Ork made straight  toward them. It was only a few yards distant when suddenly it dropped  the candle with a cry of pain and next moment alighted, fluttering  wildly, upon the rocky ledge.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Trot.    \"It bit me!\" wailed the Ork. \"I don't like your candles. The thing  began to disappear slowly as soon as I took it in my claw, and it grew  smaller and smaller until just now it turned and bit me--a most  unfriendly thing to do. Oh--oh! Ouch, what a bite!\"    \"That's the nature of candles, I'm sorry to say,\" explained Cap'n Bill,  with a grin. \"You have to handle 'em mighty keerful. But tell us, what  did you find down there?\"    \"I found a way to continue our journey,\" said the Ork, nursing tenderly  the claw which had been burned. \"Just below us is a great lake of black  water, which looked so cold and wicked that it made me shudder; but  away at the left there's a big tunnel, which we can easily walk  through. I don't know where it leads to, of course, but we must follow  it and find out.\" \"why, we can't get to it,\" protested the little girl.  \"We can't fly, as you do, you must remember.\"    \"No, that's true,\" replied the Ork musingly. \"Your bodies are built  very poorly, it seems to me, since all you can do is crawl upon the  earth's surface. But you may ride upon my back, and in that way I can  promise you a safe journey to the tunnel.\"    \"Are you strong enough to carry us?\" asked Cap'n Bill, doubtfully.    \"Yes, indeed; I'm strong enough to carry a dozen of you, if you could  find a place to sit,\" was the reply; \"but there's only room between my  wings for one at a time, so I'll have to make two trips.\"    \"All right; I'll go first,\" decided Cap'n Bill.    He lit another candle for Trot to hold while they were gone and to  light the Ork on his return to her, and then the old sailor got upon  the Ork's back, where he sat with his wooden leg sticking straight out  sidewise.    \"If you start to fall, clasp your arms around my neck,\" advised the  creature.    \"If I start to fall, it's good night an' pleasant dreams,\" said Cap'n  Bill.    \"All ready?\" asked the Ork.    \"Start the buzz-tail,\" said Cap'n Bill, with a tremble in his voice.  But the Ork flew away so gently that the old man never even tottered in  his seat. Trot watched the light of Cap'n Bill's candle till it  disappeared in the far distance. She didn't like to be left alone on  this dangerous ledge, with a lake of black water hundreds of feet below  her; but she was a brave little girl and waited patiently for the  return of the Ork. It came even sooner than she had expected and the  creature said to her:    \"Your friend is safe in the tunnel. Now, then, get aboard and I'll  carry you to him in a jiffy.\"    I'm sure not many little girls would have cared to take that awful ride  through the huge black cavern on the back of a skinny Ork. Trot didn't  care for it, herself, but it just had to be done and so she did it as  courageously as possible. Her heart beat fast and she was so nervous  she could scarcely hold the candle in her fingers as the Ork sped  swiftly through the darkness.    It seemed like a long ride to her, yet in reality the Ork covered the  distance in a wonderfully brief period of time and soon Trot stood  safely beside Cap'n Bill on the level floor of a big arched tunnel. The  sailor-man was very glad to greet his little comrade again and both  were grateful to the Ork for his assistance.    \"I dunno where this tunnel leads to,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"but it  surely looks more promisin' than that other hole we crept through.\"    \"When the Ork is rested,\" said Trot, \"we'll travel on and see what  happens.\"    \"Rested!\" cried the Ork, as scornfully as his shrill voice would allow.  \"That bit of flying didn't tire me at all. I'm used to flying days at a  time, without ever once stopping.\"    \"Then let's move on,\" proposed Cap'n Bill. He still held in his hand  one lighted candle, so Trot blew out the other flame and placed her  candle in the sailor's big pocket. She knew it was not wise to burn two  candles at once.    The tunnel was straight and smooth and very easy to walk through, so  they made good progress. Trot thought that the tunnel began about two  miles from the cavern where they had been cast by the whirlpool, but  now it was impossible to guess the miles traveled, for they walked  steadily for hours and hours without any change in their surroundings.    Finally Cap'n Bill stopped to rest.    \"There's somethin' queer about this 'ere tunnel, I'm certain,\" he  declared, wagging his head dolefully. \"Here's three candles gone  a'ready, an' only three more left us, yet the tunnel's the same as it  was when we started. An' how long it's goin' to keep up, no one knows.\"    \"Couldn't we walk without a light?\" asked Trot. \"The way seems safe  enough.\"    \"It does right now,\" was the reply, \"but we can't tell when we are  likely to come to another gulf, or somethin' jes' as dangerous. In that  case we'd be killed afore we knew it.\"    \"Suppose I go ahead?\" suggested the Ork.  \"I don't fear a fall, you  know, and if anything happens I'll call out and warn you.\"    \"That's a good idea,\" declared Trot, and Cap'n Bill thought so, too. So  the Ork started off ahead, quite in the dark, and hand in band the two  followed him.    When they had walked in this way for a good long time the Ork halted  and demanded food. Cap'n Bill had not mentioned food because there was  so little left--only three biscuits and a lump of cheese about as big  as his two fingers--but he gave the Ork half of a biscuit, sighing as  he did so. The creature didn't care for the cheese, so the sailor  divided it between himself and Trot. They lighted a candle and sat down  in the tunnel while they ate.    \"My feet hurt me,\" grumbled the Ork.  \"I'm not used to walking and this  rocky passage is so uneven and lumpy that it hurts me to walk upon it.\"    \"Can't you fly along?\" asked Trot.    \"No; the roof is too low,\" said the Ork.    After the meal they resumed their journey, which Trot began to fear  would never end. When Cap'n Bill noticed how tired the little girl was,  he paused and lighted a match and looked at his big silver watch.    \"Why, it's night!\" he exclaimed. \"We've tramped all day, an' still  we're in this awful passage, which mebbe goes straight through the  middle of the world, an'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/959"],[0,"The Lost Princess of Oz (#4)"],[1,"to wish they had not embarked on this adventure. They  grumbled a good deal at having to cut away the thorns to make the path  for the Frogman and the Cookie Cook, for their own clothing suffered  many tears, while Cayke and the Frogman traveled safely and in comfort.    \"If it is true that anyone came to our country to steal your diamond  dishpan,\" said one of the Yips to Cayke, \"it must have been a bird, for  no person in the form of a man, woman or child could have climbed  through these bushes and back again.\"    \"And, allowing he could have done so,\" said another Yip, \"the  diamond-studded gold dishpan would not have repaid him for his troubles  and his tribulations.\"    \"For my part,\" remarked a third Yip, \"I would rather go back home and  dig and polish some more diamonds and mine some more gold and make you  another dishpan than be scratched from head to heel by these dreadful  bushes.  Even now, if my mother saw me, she would not know I am her  son.\"    Cayke paid no heed to these mutterings, nor did the Frogman.  Although  their journey was slow, it was being made easy for them by the Yips, so  they had nothing to complain of and no desire to turn back.  Quite near  to the bottom of the great hill they came upon a great gulf, the sides  of which were as smooth as glass.  The gulf extended a long  distance--as far as they could see in either direction--and although it  was not very wide, it was far too wide for the Yips to leap across it.  And should they fall into it, it was likely they might never get out  again.  \"Here our journey ends,\" said the Yips. \"We must go back again.\"    Cayke the Cookie Cook began to weep.    \"I shall never find my pretty dishpan again, and my heart will be  broken!\" she sobbed.    The Frogman went to the edge of the gulf and with his eye carefully  measured the distance to the other side.  \"Being a frog,\" said he, \"I  can leap, as all frogs do, and being so big and strong, I am sure I can  leap across this gulf with ease.  But the rest of you, not being frogs,  must return the way you came.\"    \"We will do that with pleasure,\" cried the Yips, and at once they  turned and began to climb up the steep mountain, feeling they had had  quite enough of this unsatisfactory adventure.  Cayke the Cookie Cook  did not go with them, however.  She sat on a rock and wept and wailed  and was very miserable.    \"Well,\" said the Frogman to her, \"I will now bid you goodbye.  If I  find your diamond-decorated gold dishpan, I will promise to see that it  is safely returned to you.\"    \"But I prefer to find it myself!\" she said. \"See here, Frogman, why  can't you carry me across the gulf when you leap it?  You are big and  strong, while I am small and thin.\"    The Frogman gravely thought over this suggestion. It was a fact that  Cayke the Cookie Cook was not a heavy person.  Perhaps he could leap  the gulf with her on his back.  \"If you are willing to risk a fall,\"  said he, \"I will make the attempt.\"    At once she sprang up and grabbed him around his neck with both her  arms.  That is, she grabbed him where his neck ought to be, for the  Frogman had no neck at all.  Then he squatted down, as frogs do when  they leap, and with his powerful rear legs he made a tremendous jump.  Over the gulf they sailed, with the Cookie Cook on his back, and he had  leaped so hard--to make sure of not falling in--that he sailed over a  lot of bramble bushes that grew on the other side and landed in a clear  space which was so far beyond the gulf that when they looked back they  could not see it at all.    Cayke now got off the Frogman's back and he stood erect again and  carefully brushed the dust from his velvet coat and rearranged his  white satin necktie.    \"I had no idea I could leap so far,\" he said wonderingly.  \"Leaping is  one more accomplishment I can now add to the long list of deeds I am  able to perform.\"    \"You are certainly fine at leap-frog,\" said the Cookie Cook admiringly,  \"but, as you say, you are wonderful in many ways.  If we meet with any  people down here, I am sure they will consider you the greatest and  grandest of all living creatures.\"    \"Yes,\" he replied, \"I shall probably astonish strangers, because they  have never before had the pleasure of seeing me.  Also, they will  marvel at my great learning.  Every time I open my mouth, Cayke, I am  liable to say something important.\"    \"That is true,\" she agreed, \"and it is fortunate your mouth is so very  wide and opens so far, for otherwise all the wisdom might not be able  to get out of it.\"    \"Perhaps nature made it wide for that very reason,\" said the Frogman.  \"But come, let us now go on, for it is getting late and we must find  some sort of shelter before night overtakes us.\"          CHAPTER 4    AMONG THE WINKIES      The settled parts of the Winkie Country are full of happy and contented  people who are ruled by a tin Emperor named Nick Chopper, who in turn  is a subject of the beautiful girl Ruler, Ozma of Oz.  But not all of  the Winkie Country is fully settled.  At the east, which part lies  nearest the Emerald City, there are beautiful farmhouses and roads, but  as you travel west, you first come to a branch of the Winkie River,  beyond which there is a rough country where few people live, and some  of these are quite unknown to the rest of the world. After passing  through this rude section of territory, which no one ever visits, you  would come to still another branch of the Winkie River, after crossing  which you would find another well-settled part of the Winkie Country  extending westward quite to the Deadly Desert that surrounds all the  Land of Oz and separates that favored fairyland from the more common  outside world.  The Winkies who live in this west section have many tin  mines, from which metal they make a great deal of rich jewelry and  other articles, all of which are highly esteemed in the Land of Oz  because tin is so bright and pretty and there is not so much of it as  there is of gold and silver.    Not all the Winkies are miners, however, for some till the fields and  grow grains for food, and it was at one of these far-west Winkie farms  that the Frogman and Cayke the Cookie Cook first arrived after they had  descended from the mountain of the Yips.  \"Goodness me!\" cried Nellary  the Winkie wife when she saw the strange couple approaching her house.  \"I have seen many queer creatures in the Land of Oz, but none more  queer than this giant frog who dresses like a man and walks on his hind  legs.  Come here, Wiljon,\" she called to her husband, who was eating  his breakfast, \"and take a look at this astonishing freak.\"    Wiljon the Winkie came to the door and looked out.  He was still  standing in the doorway when the Frogman approached and said with a  haughty croak, \"Tell me, my good man, have you seen a diamond-studded  gold dishpan?\"    \"No, nor have I seen a copper-plated lobster,\" replied Wiljon in an  equally haughty tone.    The Frogman stared at him and said, \"Do not be insolent, fellow!\"    \"No,\" added Cayke the Cookie Cook hastily, \"you must be very polite to  the great Frogman, for he is the wisest creature in all the world.\"    \"Who says that?\" inquired Wiljon.    \"He says so himself,\" replied Cayke, and the Frogman nodded and  strutted up and down, twirling his gold-headed cane very gracefully.    \"Does the Scarecrow admit that this overgrown frog is the wisest  creature in the world?\" asked Wiljon.    \"I do not know who the Scarecrow is,\" answered Cayke the Cookie Cook.    \"Well, he lives at the Emerald City, and he is supposed to have the  finest brains in all Oz.  The Wizard gave them to him, you know.\"    \"Mine grew in my head,\" said the Frogman pompously, \"so I think they  must be better than any wizard brains.  I am so wise that sometimes my  wisdom makes my head ache.  I know so much that often I have to forget  part of it, since no one creature, however great, is able to contain so  much knowledge.\"    \"It must be dreadful to be stuffed full of wisdom,\" remarked Wiljon  reflectively and eyeing the Frogman with a doubtful look.  \"It is my  good fortune to know very little.\"    \"I hope, however, you know where my jeweled dishpan is,\" said the  Cookie Cook anxiously.    \"I do not know even that,\" returned the Winkie.  \"We have trouble  enough in keeping track of our own dishpans without meddling with the  dishpans of strangers.\"    Finding him so ignorant, the Frogman proposed that they walk on and  seek Cayke's dishpan elsewhere.  Wiljon the Winkie did not seem greatly  impressed by the great Frogman, which seemed to that personage as  strange as it was disappointing.  But others in this unknown land might  prove more respectful.    \"I'd like to meet that Wizard of Oz,\" remarked Cayke as they walked  along a path.  \"If he could give a Scarecrow brains, he might be able  to find my dishpan.\"    \"Poof!\" grunted the Frogman scornfully.  \"I am greater than any wizard.  Depend on ME.  If your dishpan is anywhere in the world, I am sure to  find it.\"    \"If you do not, my heart will be broken,\" declared the Cookie Cook in a  sorrowful voice.    For a while the Frogman walked on in silence. Then he asked, \"Why do  you attach so much importance to a dishpan?\"    \"It is the greatest treasure I possess,\" replied the woman.  \"It  belonged to my mother and to all my grandmothers since the beginning of  time.  It is, I believe, the very oldest thing in all the Yip  Country--or was while it was there--and,\" she added, dropping her voice  to an awed whisper, \"it has magic powers!\"    \"In what way?\" inquired the Frogman, seeming to be surprised at this  statement.    \"Whoever has owned that dishpan has been a good cook, for one thing. No  one else is able to make such good cookies as I have cooked, as you and  all the Yips know.  Yet the very morning after my dishpan was stolen, I  tried to make a batch of cookies and they burned up in the oven!  I  made another batch that proved too"]]]
