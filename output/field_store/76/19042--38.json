[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9943"],[0,"Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia, in Search of a (#4)"],[1," unknown in these regions.    17TH DECEMBER.--Set off about 7 A.M. and travelled along a good road, for  about 6 miles. Then, at a sheep station, we crossed the chain of ponds,  following a road leading to Dr. Ramsay's head station, called  Balderudgery. Leaving that road, and, at 7 miles, taking to the left, we  finally encamped on Spring Creek, after a journey of about 9 miles. We  had passed over what I should have called a poor sort of country, but  everywhere it was taken up for sheep; and these looked fat; yet not a  blade of grass could be seen; and, but for the late timely supply of  rain, it had been in contemplation to withdraw these flocks to the  Macquarie.    Calling at a shepherd's hut to ask the way, an Irish woman appeared with  a child at her breast and another by her side: she was hut-keeper. She  had been there two years, and only complained that they had never been  able to get any potatoes to plant. She and her husband were about to  leave the place next day, and they seemed uncertain as to where they  should go. Two miles further on, a shoemaker came to the door of a hut,  and accompanied me to set me on the right road. I inquired how he found  work in these wild parts. He said, he could get plenty of work, but very  little money; that it was chiefly contract work he lived by: he supplied  sheep-owners with shoes for their men, at so much per pair. His  conversation was about the difficulty a poor man had in providing for his  family. He had once possessed about forty cows, which he had been obliged  to entrust to the care of another man, at 5S. per head. This man  neglected them: they were impounded and sold as unlicensed cattle under  the new regulations.    \"So you saw no more of them?\"    \"Oh, yes, your honour, I saw some of them AFTER THEY HAD BEEN SOLD AT THE  POUND!--I wanted to have had something provided for a small family of  children, and if I had only had a few acres of ground, I could have kept  my cows.\"    This was merely a passing remark made with a laugh as we walked along,  for he was one of the race--    \"Who march to death with military glee.\"    But the fate of a poor man's family was a serious subject: such was the  hopeless condition of a useful mechanic ready for work even in the  desolate forests skirting the haunts of the savage. So fares it with the  DISJECTA MEMBRA of towns and villages, when such arrangements are left to  the people themselves in a new colony.    18TH DECEMBER.--The party moved off about 7 A.M., and continued along a  tolerable road, crossing what shepherds called Seven Mile Creek, in which  there was some water; and a little further on we quitted the good beaten  road leading to Balderudgery, and followed one to the left, which brought  us to another sheep station on the same chain of ponds, three miles  higher up than Balderudgery. Having directed the party to encamp here, I  pursued the road south-westward along the chain of ponds, anxious to  ascertain whether I could in that direction pass easily to the westward  of Hervey's Range, and so fall into my former line of route to the Bogan.  At about five miles I found an excellent opening through which the road  passed on ground almost level. Having ascended a small eminence on the  right, I fell in with some natives with spears, who seemed to recognise  me, by pointing to my old line of route, and saying, \"Majy Majy\" (Major  Mitchell). I little thought then that this was already an outlying  picquet of the Bogan Blacks, sent forward to observe my party. The day  was hot, therm. 97 deg. in the shade. The chain of ponds, there called \"the  Little River,\" contained water in abundance, and was said to flow into  the Macquarie, in which case the Bogan can have but few sources in  Hervey's Range.    The station beside which we had encamped, comprised a stock yard, and had  been formerly a cattle station belonging to Mr. Kite. It was now a sheep  station of Dr. Ramsay's, and there was another sheep station a mile and a  half from it, along the road I had examined. Thus the country suitable  for either kind of stock is taken up by the gradual encroachment of sheep  on cattle runs, not properly such. This easily takes place--as where  sheep feed, cattle will not remain, and sheep will fatten where cattle  would lose flesh. Fortunately, however, for the holders of the latter  description of stock, there are limits to this kind of encroachment. The  plains to the westward of these ranges afford the most nutritive  pasturage in the world for cattle, and they are too flat and subject to  inundations to be desirable for sheep. A zone of country of this  description lies on the interior side of the ranges, as far as I have  examined them. It is watered by the sources of the rivers Goulburn,  Ovens, Murray, Murrumbidgee, Lachlan, Bogan, Macquarie, Castlereagh,  Nammoy, Peel, Gwydir, and Darling; on which rivers the runs will always  make cattle fat. There are two shrubs palpably salt, and, perhaps, there  is something salsolaceous in the herbage also on which cattle thrive so  well; and the open plains and muddy waterholes are their delight.  Excessive drought, however, may occasionally reduce the owners of such  stock to great extremities, and subject them to serious loss. The Acacia  pendula, a tree whose HABITAT is limited and remarkable, is much relished  by the cattle. It is found only in clay soils, on the borders of plains,  which are occasionally so saturated with water as to be quite impassable;  never on higher ground nor on any lower than that limited sort of  locality, in the neighbourhood of rivers which at some seasons overflow.  In such situations, even where grass seems very scarce, cattle get fat;  and it is a practice of stockmen to cut down the Acacia pendula (or Myall  trees, as they call them) for the cattle to feed on.    At this sheep station where we had encamped, I met with an individual who  had seen better days, and had lost his property amid the wreck of  colonial bankruptcies--a tea-totaller, with Pope's Essay on Man for his  consolation, in a bark hut. This \"melancholy Jaques\" lamented the state  of depravity to which the colony was reduced, and assured me that there  were shepherdesses in the bush! This startling fact should not be  startling, but for the disproportion of sexes, and the squatting system  which checks the spread of families. If pastoralisation were not one  thing, and colonisation another, the occupation of tending sheep should  be as fit and proper for women as for men. The pastoral life, so  favourable to love and the enjoyment of nature, has ever been a favourite  theme of the poet. Here it appears to be the antidote of all poetry and  propriety, only because man's better half is wanting. Under this  unfavourable aspect the white man first comes before the aboriginal  native; were the intruders accompanied by women and children, they could  not be half so unwelcome. One of the most striking differences between  squatting and settling in Australia consists in this. Indeed if it were  an object to uncivilise the human race, I know of no method more likely  to effect it than to isolate a man from the gentler sex and children;  remove afar off all courts of justice and means of redress of grievances,  all churches and schools, all shops where he can make use of money, then  place him in close contact with savages. \"What better off am I than a  black native?\" was the exclamation of a shepherd to me just before I  penned these remarks.    19TH DECEMBER.--The party moved along the road I had previously examined.  On passing through to the western side, I recognised the trees, plants,  and birds of the interior regions. Granitic hills appeared on each side,  and the sweet-scented Callitris grew around, with many a curious shrub  never seen to the eastward of these ranges. On descending, grassy  valleys, with gullies containing little or no water, reminded me of  former difficulties in the same vicinity, and it was not until we had  travelled upwards of sixteen miles that I could encamp near water. This  consisted of some very muddy holes of the Goobang Creek, on which I had  formerly been pleasantly encamped with Mr. Cunningham. [* See Vol. I. of  Three Expeditions, etc., page 171.] Two or three natives soon made their  appearance, one of whom I immediately recognised to be my old friend  Bultje, who had guided me from thence to the Bene Rocks, on my former  journey along the Bogan. He brought an offering of honey. Ten years had  elapsed since I formerly met the same native in the same valley, and time  had made no alteration in his appearance. With the same readiness to  forward my views that he formerly evinced, he informed me where the water  was to be found; and how I should travel so as to fall in with my former  route, by the least possible DETOUR. Mount Laidley bore 23 deg. E. of N.    20TH DECEMBER.--This day I gave the cattle a rest, as the grass seemed  good, while I rode to look at my old line of marked trees. A cattle  station (of Mr. Kite) was within a mile and a half of our camp, and at  about three miles below it, I fell in with the former line. Where it  crossed the Goobang, a track still continued by them, but finally  diverged, leaving the line of marked trees, without the slightest trace  of the wheels or hoofs that had formerly passed by it. Reaching a hill  laid down on my former survey, and from which I recognised Mount Laidley,  I returned directly to the camp. We had encamped near those very springs  mentioned as seen on my former journey, but instead of being limpid and  surrounded by verdant grass, as they had been then, they were now trodden  by cattle into muddy holes, where the poor natives had been endeavouring  to protect a small portion from the cattle's feet, and keep it pure, by  laying over it trees they had cut down for the purpose. The change  produced in the aspect of this formerly happy secluded valley, by the  intrusion of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9963"],[0,"Elsie's Girlhood (#4)"],[1,"ghter, always living as housekeeper in the  families where they resided--had grown to be a sweet, engaging child,  inheriting her mother's beauty and gentleness. She had also her  mother's craving for affection, and was constantly looking and longing  for the return of her unknown father, which was delayed from time to  time until she was nearly eight years of age.    \"At last he came; but ah, what a bitter disappointment awaited the  poor child! His mind had been poisoned against her, and instead of  the love and tenderness she had a right to expect, he met her with  coldness--almost with aversion. Poor little one! she was nearly  heartbroken, and for a time scarcely dared venture into her father's  presence. She was gentle, submissive, and patient; he cold, haughty,  and stern. But she would love him, in spite of his sternness, and at  length she succeeded in winning her way to his affections, and he  learned to love her with passionate tenderness.    \"Still her troubles were not over. She was sincerely pious, and  conscientiously strict in many things which her father deemed of  little importance; especially was this the case in regard to the  observance of the Sabbath. He was a man of iron will, and she, though  perfectly submissive in other respects, had the firmness of a martyr  in resisting any interference with her conscience.    \"Well, their wills came in collision. He required her to do what she  considered a violation of God's law, although he could see no harm  in it, and therefore considered her stubborn and disobedient. He was  firm, but so was she. He tried persuasions, threats, punishments--all  without effect. He banished her from his arms, from the family circle,  deprived her of amusements, denied her to visitors, broke off her  correspondence with a valued friend, sent away her nurse; and finding  all these acts of severity ineffectual, he at length left her, telling  her he would return only when she submitted; and even refusing her a  parting caress, which she pleaded for with heart-breaking entreaties.\"    Mr. Dinsmore's voice trembled with emotion, but recovering himself, he  went on:    \"Don't think, Miss Allison, that all this time the father's heart was  not bleeding; it was, at every pore; but he was determined to conquer,  and mistook the child's motives and the source of her strength to  resist his will.    \"He had bought a beautiful estate; he caused the house to be  handsomely fitted up and furnished, especially lavishing trouble and  expense upon a suite of rooms for his little girl, and when all was  completed, he wrote to her, bidding her go and see the lovely home  he had prepared for her reception as soon as she would submit,--and  presenting, as the only alternative, banishment to a boarding-school  or convent until her education was finished. This was the one drop  which made the cup overflow. The poor suffering child was prostrated  by a brain fever which brought her to the very gates of death. Then  the father's eyes were opened; he saw his folly and his sin, and  repented in sackcloth and ashes; and God, in His great mercy, was  pleased to spare him the terrible crushing blow which seemed to have  already fallen;--for at one time they told him his child was dead. Oh,  never, never can he forget the unutterable anguish of that moment!\"    Mr. Dinsmore paused, unable to proceed. Rose had been weeping for some  time. She well knew to whose story she was listening, and her gentle,  loving heart was filled with pity for both him and for his child.    \"I have but little more to tell,\" he resumed; \"the child has at length  entirely recovered her health; she is dearer to her father's heart  than words can express, and is very happy in the knowledge that it is  so, and that henceforward he will strive to assist her to walk in the  narrow way, instead of endeavoring to lead her from it.    \"Their home has been a very happy one; but it lacks one thing--the  wife and mother's place is vacant; she who filled it once is  gone--never to return!--but there is a sweet, gentle lady who has  won the hearts of both father and daughter, and whom they would fain  persuade to fill the void in their affections and their home.    \"Miss Rose, dare I hope that you would venture to trust your happiness  in the hands of a man who has proved himself capable of such cruelty?\"    Rose did not speak, and he seemed to read in her silence and her  averted face a rejection of his suit.    \"Ah, you cannot love or trust me!\" he exclaimed bitterly. \"I was  indeed a fool to hope it. Forgive me for troubling you; forgive my  presumption in imagining for a moment that I might be able to win you.  But oh, Rose, could you but guess how I love you--better than aught  else upon earth save my precious child! and even as I love her better  than life. I said that our home had been a happy one, but to me it can  be so no longer if you refuse to share it with me!\"    She turned her blushing face towards him for a single instant, and  timidly placed her hand in his. The touch sent a thrill through her  whole frame.    \"And you will dare trust me?\" he said in a low tone of intense joy.  \"Oh, Rose! I have not deserved such happiness as this! I am not worthy  of one so pure and good. But I will do all that man can do to make  your life bright and happy.\"    \"Ah, Mr. Dinsmore! I am very unfit for the place you have asked me  to fill,\" she murmured. \"I am not old enough, or wise enough to be a  mother to your little girl.\"    \"I know you are young, dear Rose, but you are far from foolish,\" he  said tenderly, \"and my little girl is quite prepared to yield you a  daughter's love and obedience; but I do not think she will be a care  or trouble to you; I do not intend that she shall, but expect to take  all that upon myself. Indeed, Rose, dearest, you shall never know any  care or trouble that I can save you from. No words can tell how dear  you are to me, and were it in my power I would shield you from every  annoyance, and give you every joy that the human heart can know. I  have loved you from the first day we met!--ah, I loved you even before  that, for all your love and kindness to my darling child; but I  scarcely dared hope that you could return my affection, or feel  willing to trust your happiness to the keeping of one who had shown  himself such a monster of cruelty in his treatment of his little  gentle daughter. Are you not afraid of me, Rose?\"    His arm was around her waist, and he was bending over her, gazing down  into her face, and eagerly awaiting her answer.    Presently it came, in calm, gentle tones; \"No, Horace; 'perfect love  casteth out fear,' and I cannot judge you hardly for what may  have been only a mistaken sense of duty, and has been so bitterly  repented.\"    \"Heaven bless you, dearest, for these words,\" he answered with  emotion, \"they have made me the happiest of men.\"    Horace Dinsmore wore upon his little finger a splendid diamond ring,  which had attracted a good deal of attention, especially among the  ladies; who admired it extremely, and of which Miss Stevens had hoped  to be one day the happy and envied possessor. Taking Rose's small  white hand in his again, he placed it upon her slender finger.    \"This seals our compact, and makes you mine forever,\" he said,  pressing the hand to his lips.    \"With the consent of my parents,\" murmured Rose, a soft blush mantling  her cheek.    Elsie was still in her papa's private parlor, for though it was long  past her usual hour for retiring, she had not yet done so; her father  having left a message with Chloe to the effect that she might, if she  chose, stay up until his return.    Chloe had dropped asleep in her chair, and the little girl was  trying to while away the time with a book. But she did not seem much  interested in it, for every now and then she laid it down to run to  the door and listen. Then sighing to herself, \"They are not coming  yet,\" she would go back and take it up again. But at last she started  from her seat with an exclamation of delight that awoke Chloe; for  this time there could be no doubt; she had heard his well-known step  upon the stairs.    She moved quickly towards the door--stopped--hesitated, and stood  still to the middle of the room.    But the door opened, and her father entered with Miss Rose upon his  arm. One look at his radiant countenance, and Rose's blushing, happy  face told the whole glad story. He held out his hand with a beaming  smile, and Elsie sprang towards him.    \"My darling,\" he said, stooping to give her a kiss, \"I have brought  you a mother.\"    Then taking Rose's hand, and placing one of Elsie's in it, while he  held the other in a close, loving grasp, he added: \"Rose, she is your  daughter also. I give you a share in my choicest treasure.\"    Rose threw her arm around the little girl and kissed her tenderly,  whispering: \"Will you love me, Elsie, dearest? you know how dearly I  love you.\"    \"Indeed I will; I do love you very much, and I am very glad, dear,  darling Miss Rose,\" Elsie replied, returning her caress.    Mr. Dinsmore was watching them with a heart swelling with joy and  gratitude. He led Rose to a sofa, and seating himself by her side,  drew Elsie in between his knees, and put an arm round each. \"My two  treasures,\" he said, looking affectionately from one to the other.  \"Rose, I feel myself the richest man in the Union.\"    Rose smiled, and Elsie laid her head on her father's shoulder with a  happy sigh.    They sat a few moments thus, when Rose made a movement to go,  remarking that it must be growing late. She felt a secret desire to  be safe within the shelter of her own room before the return of the  riding party should expose her to Miss Stevens' prying curiosity.    \"It is not quite ten yet,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, looking at his watch.    \"Late enough though, is it not?\" she answered with a smile. \"I think I  must go. Good-night, dear little Elsie.\" She rose, and Mr."]]]
