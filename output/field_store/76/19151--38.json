Doubtless, he thought it meet of him  To say good-by to men.            X.    I died for beauty, but was scarce  Adjusted in the tomb,  When one who died for truth was lain  In an adjoining room.    He questioned softly why I failed?  \"For beauty,\" I replied.  \"And I for truth, -- the two are one;  We brethren are,\" he said.    And so, as kinsmen met a night,  We talked between the rooms,  Until the moss had reached our lips,  And covered up our names.            XI.    \"TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS.\"    How many times these low feet staggered,  Only the soldered mouth can tell;  Try! can you stir the awful rivet?  Try! can you lift the hasps of steel?    Stroke the cool forehead, hot so often,  Lift, if you can, the listless hair;  Handle the adamantine fingers  Never a thimble more shall wear.    Buzz the dull flies on the chamber window;  Brave shines the sun through the freckled pane;  Fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling --  Indolent housewife, in daisies lain!            XII.    REAL.    I like a look of agony,  Because I know it 's true;  Men do not sham convulsion,  Nor simulate a throe.    The eyes glaze once, and that is death.  Impossible to feign  The beads upon the forehead  By homely anguish strung.            XIII.    THE FUNERAL.    That short, potential stir  That each can make but once,  That bustle so illustrious  'T is almost consequence,    Is the eclat of death.  Oh, thou unknown renown  That not a beggar would accept,  Had he the power to spurn!            XIV.    I went to thank her,  But she slept;  Her bed a funnelled stone,  With nosegays at the head and foot,  That travellers had thrown,    Who went to thank her;  But she slept.  'T was short to cross the sea  To look upon her like, alive,  But turning back 't was slow.            XV.    I've seen a dying eye  Run round and round a room  In search of something, as it seemed,  Then cloudier become;  And then, obscure with fog,  And then be soldered down,  Without disclosing what it be,  'T were blessed to have seen.            XVI.    REFUGE.    The clouds their backs together laid,  The north begun to push,  The forests galloped till they fell,  The lightning skipped like mice;  The thunder crumbled like a stuff --  How good to be safe in tombs,  Where nature's temper cannot reach,  Nor vengeance ever comes!            XVII.    I never saw a moor,  I never saw the sea;  Yet know I how the heather looks,  And what a wave must be.    I never spoke with God,  Nor visited in heaven;  Yet certain am I of the spot  As if the chart were given.            XVIII.    PLAYMATES.    God permits industrious angels  Afternoons to play.  I met one, -- forgot my school-mates,  All, for him, straightway.    God calls home the angels promptly  At the setting sun;  I missed mine. How dreary marbles,  After playing Crown!            XIX.    To know just how he suffered would be dear;  To know if any human eyes were near  To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,  Until it settled firm on Paradise.    To know if he was patient, part content,  Was dying as he thought, or different;  Was it a pleasant day to die,  And did the sunshine face his way?    What was his furthest mind, of home, or God,  Or what the distant say  At news that he ceased human nature  On such a day?    And wishes, had he any?  Just his sigh, accented,  Had been legible to me.  And was he confident until  Ill fluttered out in everlasting well?    And if he spoke, what name was best,  What first,  What one broke off with  At the drowsiest?    Was he afraid, or tranquil?  Might he know  How conscious consciousness could grow,  Till love that was, and love too blest to be,  Meet -- and the junction be Eternity?            XX.    The last night that she lived,  It was a common night,  Except the dying; this to us  Made nature different.    We noticed smallest things, --  Things overlooked before,  By this great light upon our minds  Italicized, as 't were.    That others could exist  While she must finish quite,  A jealousy for her arose  So nearly infinite.    We waited while she passed;  It was a narrow time,  Too jostled were our souls to speak,  At length the notice came.    She mentioned, and forgot;  Then lightly as a reed  Bent to the water, shivered scarce,  Consented, and was dead.    And we, we placed the hair,  And drew the head erect;  And then an awful leisure was,  Our faith to regulate.            XXI.    THE FIRST LESSON.    Not in this world to see his face  Sounds long, until I read the place  Where this is said to be  But just the primer to a life  Unopened, rare, upon the shelf,  Clasped yet to him and me.    And yet, my primer suits me so  I would not choose a book to know  Than that, be sweeter wise;  Might some one else so learned be,  And leave me just my A B C,  Himself could have the skies.            XXII.    The bustle in a house  The morning after death  Is solemnest of industries  Enacted upon earth, --    The sweeping up the heart,  And putting love away  We shall not want to use again  Until eternity.            XXIII.    I reason, earth is short,  And anguish absolute,  And many hurt;  But what of that?    I reason, we could die:  The best vitality  Cannot excel decay;  But what of that?    I reason that in heaven  Somehow, it will be even,  Some new equation given;  But what of that?            XXIV.    Afraid? Of whom am I afraid?  Not death; for who is he?  The porter of my father's lodge  As much abasheth me.    Of life? 'T were odd I fear a thing  That comprehendeth me  In one or more existences  At Deity's decree.    Of resurrection? Is the east  Afraid to trust the morn  With her fastidious forehead?  As soon impeach my crown!            XXV.    DYING.    The sun kept setting, setting still;  No hue of afternoon  Upon the village I perceived, --  From house to house 't was noon.    The dusk kept dropping, dropping still;  No dew upon the grass,  But only on my forehead stopped,  And wandered in my face.    My feet kept drowsing, drowsing still,  My fingers were awake;  Yet why so little sound myself  Unto my seeming make?    How well I knew the light before!  I could not see it now.  'T is dying, I am doing; but  I'm not afraid to know.            XXVI.    Two swimmers wrestled on the spar  Until the morning sun,  When one turned smiling to the land.  O God, the other one!    The stray ships passing spied a face  Upon the waters borne,  With eyes in death still begging raised,  And hands beseeching thrown.            XXVII.    THE CHARIOT.    Because I could not stop for Death,  He kindly stopped for me;  The carriage held but just ourselves  And Immortality.    We slowly drove, he knew no haste,  And I had put away  My labor, and my leisure too,  For his civility.    We passed the school where children played,  Their lessons scarcely done;  We passed the fields of gazing grain,  We passed the setting sun.    We paused before a house that seemed  A swelling of the ground;  The roof was scarcely visible,  The cornice but a mound.    Since then 't is centuries; but each  Feels shorter than the day  I first surmised the horses' heads  Were toward eternity.            XXVIII.    She went as quiet as the dew  From a familiar flower.  Not like the dew did she return  At the accustomed hour!    She dropt as softly as a star  From out my summer's eve;  Less skilful than Leverrier  It's sorer to believe!            XXIX.    RESURGAM.    At last to be identified!  At last, the lamps upon thy side,  The rest of life to see!  Past midnight, past the morning star!  Past sunrise! Ah! what leagues there are  Between our feet and day!            XXX.    Except to heaven, she is nought;  Except for angels, lone;  Except to some wide-wandering bee,  A flower superfluous blown;    Except for winds, provincial;  Except by butterflies,  Unnoticed as a single dew  That on the acre lies.    The smallest housewife in the grass,  Yet take her from the lawn,  And somebody has lost the face  That made existence home!            XXXI.    Death is a dialogue between  The spirit and the dust.  \"Dissolve,\" says Death. The Spirit, \"Sir,  I have another trust.\"    Death doubts it, argues from the ground.  The Spirit turns away,  Just laying off, for evidence,  An overcoat of clay.            XXXII.    It was too late for man,  But early yet for God;  Creation impotent to help,  But prayer remained our side.    How excellent the heaven,  When earth cannot be had;  How hospitable, then, the face  Of our old neighbor, God!            XXXIII.    ALONG THE POTOMAC.    When I was small, a woman died.  To-day her only boy  Went up from the Potomac,  His face all victory,    To look at her; how slowly  The seasons must have turned  Till bullets clipt an angle,  And he passed quickly round!    If pride shall be in Paradise  I never can decide;  Of their imperial conduct,  No person testified.    But proud in apparition,  That woman and her boy  Pass back and forth before my brain,  As ever in the sky.            XXXIV.    The daisy follows soft the sun,  And when his golden walk is done,     Sits shyly at his feet.  He, waking, finds the flower near.  \"Wherefore, marauder, art thou here?\"     \"Because, sir, love is sweet!\"    We are the flower, Thou the sun!  Forgive us, if as days decline,     We nearer steal to Thee, --  Enamoured of the parting west,  The peace, the flight, the amethyst,     Night's possibility!            XXXV.    EMANCIPATION.    No rack can torture me,  My soul's at liberty  Behind this mortal bone  There knits a bolder one    You cannot prick with saw,  Nor rend with scymitar.  Two bodies therefore be;  Bind one, and one will flee.    The eagle of his nest  No easier divest  And gain the sky,  Than mayest thou,    Except thyself may be  Thine enemy;  Captivity is consciousness,  So's liberty.            XXXVI."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12255"],[0,"The Egyptian Conception of Immortality (#5)"],[1,"processions were only introductory.  The principal procession took  place on the following day (or days), when Osiris went forth to  his death at Nedit.  The actual death scene certainly took place  in secret.  But when the dead body was found, the multitude joined  in the wailing and the lamentations.  The god Thoth went forth in  a boat and brought back the body of Osiris.  The body was prepared  for burial and taken in funeral procession to the grave at Peker.  Osiris was avenged on his enemies in a great battle on the water  at Nedit.  Finally, the god, his life revived, comes from Peker in  triumphant procession and enters his temple at Abydos.    Osiris mysteries were celebrated at other places, at least in  later times and perhaps even in the Middle Empire; but it is not  easy to discern the part these mysteries played in the Middle  Empire in the beliefs of the common people regarding their  immortality.  The Osiris story was one of the most widespread in  Egypt, and, powerful in its effect on the feelings of all  classes, was certain, sooner or later, to prepare the way for a  general belief in a better immortality; but if we may judge from  the burial customs, the great mass of the people still believed  merely in an underworld, Earu, a duplicate of the earthly life,  but with greater possibilities of danger and evil.    During the course of Egyptian history the position in which the  body is buried undergoes a series of remarkable changes.  During  the early pre-dynastic period, the body, loosely enfolded in  cloths and skins, is laid in the grave double up on the left  side, _usually_ with the head south (i.e. upstream).  This  position becomes the custom, with very few exceptions, during the  late predynastic period and the first three dynasties.  Throughout  the Fourth to Sixth Dynasties, the body was in the same position,  but with the head north, loosely covered with shawls and  garments.  The crouching position, with some slight modifications,  continues to be used for the poorest class down to the New  Empire. Among the Nubians, it is universal to the New Empire and  customary even later in unmixed Nubian communities.  The swathed  extended burials begin in Egypt in the Fourth Dynasty, so far as  remains are preserved.  Some members of the royal family of Cheops  were buried in swathed wrapping, lying extended on the left side  with the knees bent.  During the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties this  extended position on the side becomes customary for the better  classes; and during the Middle Empire it becomes almost  universal.    The final burial position, the swathed mummy lying extended on  the back, does not become general until the New Empire, about  1600 B.C. although it is the position hitherto regarded as the  characteristic Egyptian burial position.  A few isolated cases,  some of them perhaps accidental, occur as early as the Old  Empire; but in the New Empire the extended burial on the back is  practically the only one to be observed.  In other words,  beginning in the predynastic period with a burial position which  may be called natural and primitive, the Egyptian gradually  adopted a position which imitated the form of the dead Osiris,  the god of the dead.  Each new change is first adopted by the  royal family, and is taken up by the other classes in turn until  it becomes universal.  In the final form, the mummy was a  simulacrum of the dead as Osiris.    Alongside these changes in the burial position progressed the art  of preserving the body.  The earliest attempts were made on the  body of the king; and the knowledge of embalming gained in  preserving his body was gradually utilized for the higher classes  and finally for all but the poorest.  It seems indisputable that  the royal personages of the Fourth and Sixth Dynasties were  mummified--i.e., the entrails were drawn, the body prepared  with spices and resins and wrapped tightly in cloths smeared with  resin.  But the mummies of the nobles, even of this period, show  no trace of such treatment.  The receptacles for the viscera are  sometimes found in their graves in the Sixth Dynasty, but are, as  a rule, empty, being mere dummy vases.  Even in the Middle Empire,  the preservation of the bodies of the better classes was  extremely imperfect.  The bundles of wrappings have kept their  form to the present day and it seems as if the mummy were still  intact; but an examination of the interior shows only loose  bones.  Successful mummification appears among better-class people  in the New Empire for the first time and becomes a general custom  in the Late Period.  The processes of successful mummification  necessitated the practical destruction of the body.    In the Middle Empire, which is the period under discussion, the  process of mummification had reached a middle stage, and, while  we are unable to explain exactly the causal relationship, it is  clear that this advance in the treatment of the body accompanied  a spread of the belief in the Osirian immortality.          VII. THE NEW EMPIRE      The New Empire (1600-1200 B.C.) was the great period of foreign  conquest.  The Hyksos, Asiatic invaders, had held Egypt for a  century or more.  The Theban princes who drove them out became  kings of Egypt, and followed them into Asia.  With an army trained  in war by the long struggle with the Hyksos, the Egyptian kings,  having tasted the sweetness of the spoils of war, entered on the  conquest of western Asia and the Sudan.  The plunder of both these  regions poured into Egypt.  Under Thothmes III an annual campaign  was conducted into Syria to bring back the spoils and the  tribute.  Foreign slaves and the products of foreign handicraft  were for sale in every market-place.  The treasury was filled to  overflowing.  A large share was assigned to Amon, the god of the  Theban family.  Temples were built for him; estates established  for the maintenance of his rites; thousands of priests enrolled  for the service of his properties.  The god became, in a material  sense, the greatest god of Egypt, the national god; and his  priesthood became the most powerful organization in the kingdom.  The high priest of Amon usurped the power of the king and finally  supplanted him.  Such was the period in which the next great  development of the Egyptian idea of immortality is to be noted--  a period of priestly activity in the beginning and of priestly  domination in the end.    The priests are the scribes, the men of learning.  They have the  lore of all magic, medicine, rules of conduct, religious rites.  It is not mere chance, therefore, that the New Empire was marked  by a great increase of magic in all its forms--texts and  symbolic objects--and by a great development in the knowledge  of the other world.  In some of the texts the geography of the  underworld, in which Osiris is king, is worked out in great  detail.  When the sun sets in the west, Ra in his boat enters the  underworld and passes through it during the twelve hours of the  night, bringing light and happiness to those who are in the  underworld.  In the effort to secure the tomb against plundering,  the royal graves had been cut in the solid rock,--long and  complicated passages with false leads and deceptive turns and the  burial chamber in an unexpected place.  The long walls of these  rooms presented a great surface suitable to decoration, and they  were utilized to depict scenes from the underworld and the  passage of Ra through it, so that the tombs became in fact  representations of the land of the dead, and were so considered.  These royal tombs were at a distance from the cultivated land,  hidden in valleys in the desert.  Their funerary temples were  built on the edge of the desert beside the temples of the gods of  the place.    Such fantastical reconstructions of the other world, however,  never found general favor and are confined to a few royal tombs.  The priests and other prominent people have rolls of papyrus  buried with them, bearing copies of books of the dead.  These  books of the dead are made up of a series of chapters, each  complete in itself and each dealing with some phase of the future  life.  There is no set order of chapters.  There is no fixed number  of chapters.  Each scribe seems to have selected the chapters  which he considered useful.  The general title is: Chapters of the  going forth by day.  The general character may be given by a  paragraph attached to one of the chapters in the Book of Ani the  Scribe [Edited by E. A. W. Budge, p. 26]: \"If this book be known  on earth and written on the coffin, it is my mouth.  He shall come  forth by day in any form he desires and he shall go into his  place without being prevented.  There shall be given to him bread  and beer and meat upon the altar of Osiris.  He shall enter in, in  peace, to the field of Earu according to this decree of the one  who is in the City of Dedu.  There shall be given to him wheat and  barley there.  He shall flourish as he did upon earth.  He shall do  his desires like these nine Gods who are in the underworld, as  found true millions of times.  He is the Osiris: the Scribe Ani.\"    There are chapters to overcome all the evil which a soul may  encounter; there are words to greet all the gods whom the soul  desires to visit.  The Scribe Ani had an exceptional position on  earth; he desires to do his desire in the other world; and in the  names of Osiris he recites the magic words that bring him the  power.  He is Ani, but he calls himself Osiris; just as the  priestly doctor mixes his dose of medicine and calls it \"the eye  of Horus tested and found true.\"    In addition to magical texts, there are also magical, or  symbolic, objects placed in the graves,--amulets of various  kinds which were to be used in the other world.  Some of these  were simply the amulets used in daily life to guard against  sickness, bite of snake, and other earthly evils which were also"]]]
