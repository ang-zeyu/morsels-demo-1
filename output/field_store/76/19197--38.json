The outer door of this room, which was open, was nearly on  a level with the Quadrangle; some coats, and trousers, and boots were  upon the ebony table, and a \"gyp\" was brushing away at them just within  the door--in wet weather he performed these functions entirely within  the library--as innocent of the incongruity of his position as my guide  himself. Oh! Richard of Bury, I sighed, for a sharp stone from your  sling to pierce with indignant sarcasm the mental armour of these  College dullards.    Happily, things are altered now, and the disgrace of such neglect no  longer hangs on the College. Let us hope, in these days of revived  respect for antiquity, no other College library is in a similar plight.    Not Englishmen alone are guilty, however, of such unloving treatment  of their bibliographical treasures. The following is translated from an  interesting work just published in Paris,[1] and shows how, even at this  very time, and in the centre of the literary activity of France, books  meet their fate.      [1] Le luxe des Livres par L. Derome. 8vo, Paris, 1879.    M. Derome loquitur:--      \"Let us now enter the communal library of some large provincial town.  The interior has a lamentable appearance; dust and disorder have made it  their home. It has a librarian, but he has the consideration of a porter  only, and goes but once a week to see the state of the books committed  to his care; they are in a bad state, piled in heaps and perishing in  corners for want of attention and binding. At this present time (1879)  more than one public library in Paris could be mentioned in which  thousands of books are received annually, all of which will have  disappeared in the course of 50 years or so for want of binding; there  are rare books, impossible to replace, falling to pieces because no care  is given to them, that is to say, they are left unbound, a prey to dust  and the worm, and cannot be touched without dismemberment.\"    \"All history shows that this neglect belongs not to any particular age or  nation. I extract the following story from Edmond Werdet's Histoire du  Livre.\"[1]      [1] \"Histoire du Livre en France,\" par E. Werdet. 8vo, Paris, 1851.      \"The Poet Boccaccio, when travelling in Apulia, was anxious to visit the  celebrated Convent of Mount Cassin, especially to see its library, of  which he had heard much. He accosted, with great courtesy, one of  the monks whose countenance attracted him, and begged him to have the  kindness to show him the library. 'See for yourself,' said the monk,  brusquely, pointing at the same time to an old stone staircase, broken  with age. Boccaccio hastily mounted in great joy at the prospect of a  grand bibliographical treat. Soon he reached the room, which was  without key or even door as protection to its treasures. What was his  astonishment to see that the grass growing in the window-sills actually  darkened the room, and that all the books and seats were an inch thick  in dust. In utter astonishment he lifted one book after another.  All were manuscripts of extreme antiquity, but all were dreadfully  dilapidated. Many had lost whole sections which had been violently  extracted, and in many all the blank margins of the vellum had been cut  away. In fact, the mutilation was thorough.    \"Grieved at seeing the work and the wisdom of so many illustrious men  fallen into the hands of custodians so unworthy, Boccaccio descended  with tears in his eyes. In the cloisters he met another monk, and  enquired of him how the MSS. had become so mutilated. 'Oh!' he replied,  'we are obliged, you know, to earn a few sous for our needs, so we cut  away the blank margins of the manuscripts for writing upon, and make of  them small books of devotion, which we sell to women and children.\"    As a postscript to this story, Mr. Timmins, of Birmingham, informs me  that the treasures of the Monte Cassino Library are better cared for now  than in Boccaccio's days, the worthy prior being proud of his valuable  MSS. and very willing to show them. It will interest many readers to  know that there is now a complete printing office, lithographic as well  as typographic, at full work in one large room of the Monastery, where  their wonderful MS. of Dante has been already reprinted, and where other  fac-simile works are now in progress.        CHAPTER V. IGNORANCE AND BIGOTRY.    IGNORANCE, though not in the same category as fire and water, is a great  destroyer of books. At the Reformation so strong was the antagonism of  the people generally to anything like the old idolatry of the Romish  Church, that they destroyed by thousands books, secular as well as  sacred, if they contained but illuminated letters. Unable to read, they  saw no difference between romance and a psalter, between King Arthur  and King David; and so the paper books with all their artistic ornaments  went to the bakers to heat their ovens, and the parchment manuscripts,  however beautifully illuminated, to the binders and boot makers.    There is another kind of ignorance which has often worked destruction,  as shown by the following anecdote, which is extracted from a  letter written in 1862 by M. Philarete Chasles to Mr. B. Beedham, of  Kimbolton:--      \"Ten years ago, when turning out an old closet in the Mazarin Library,  of which I am librarian, I discovered at the bottom, under a lot of old  rags and rubbish, a large volume. It had no cover nor title-page, and  had been used to light the fires of the librarians. This shows how great  was the negligence towards our literary treasure before the Revolution;  for the pariah volume, which, 60 years before, had been placed in the  Invalides, and which had certainly formed part of the original Mazarin  collections, turned out to be a fine and genuine Caxton.\"      I saw this identical volume in the Mazarin Library in April, 1880. It is  a noble copy of the First Edition of the \"Golden Legend,\" 1483, but of  course very imperfect.    Among the millions of events in this world which cross and re-cross one  another, remarkable coincidences must often occur; and a case exactly  similar to that at the Mazarin Library, happened about the same time  in London, at the French Protestant Church, St. Martin's-le-Grand. Many  years ago I discovered there, in a dirty pigeon hole close to the grate  in the vestry, a fearfully mutilated copy of Caxton's edition of the  Canterbury Tales, with woodcuts. Like the book at Paris, it had long  been used, leaf by leaf, in utter ignorance of its value, to light the  vestry fire. Originally worth at least L800, it was then worth half,  and, of course, I energetically drew the attention of the minister in  charge to it, as well as to another grand Folio by Rood and Hunte, 1480.  Some years elapsed, and then the Ecclesiastical Commissioners took the  foundation in hand, but when at last Trustees were appointed, and the  valuable library was re-arranged and catalogued, this \"Caxton,\" together  with the fine copy of \"Latterbury\" from the first Oxford Press, had  disappeared entirely. Whatever ignorance may have been displayed in the  mutilation, quite another word should be applied to the disappearance.    The following anecdote is so _apropos_, that although it has lately  appeared in No. 1 of _The Antiquary_, I cannot resist the temptation of  re-printing it, as a warning to inheritors of old libraries. The account  was copied by me years ago from a letter written in 1847, by the Rev. C.  F. Newmarsh, Rector of Pelham, to the Rev. S. R. Maitland, Librarian to  the Archbishop of Canterbury, and is as follows:--      \"In June, 1844, a pedlar called at a cottage in Blyton and asked an old  widow, named Naylor, whether she had any rags to sell. She answered, No!  but offered him some old paper, and took from a shelf the 'Boke of St.  Albans' and others, weighing 9 lbs., for which she received 9_d_. The  pedlar carried them through Gainsborough tied up in string, past a  chemist's shop, who, being used to buy old paper to wrap his drugs in,  called the man in, and, struck by the appearance of the 'Boke,' gave him  3_s_. for the lot. Not being able to read the Colophon, he took it to an  equally ignorant stationer, and offered it to him for a guinea, at which  price he declined it, but proposed that it should be exposed in his  window as a means of eliciting some information about it. It was  accordingly placed there with this label, 'Very old curious work.'  A collector of books went in and offered half-a-crown for it, which  excited the suspicion of the vendor. Soon after Mr. Bird, Vicar of  Gainsborough, went in and asked the price, wishing to possess a very  early specimen of printing, but not knowing the value of the book. While  he was examining it, Stark, a very intelligent bookseller, came in, to  whom Mr. Bird at once ceded the right of pre-emption. Stark betrayed  such visible anxiety that the vendor, Smith, declined setting a price.  Soon after Sir C. Anderson, of Lea (author of Ancient Models), came in  and took away the book to collate, but brought it back in the morning  having found it imperfect in the middle, and offered L5 for it. Sir  Charles had no book of reference to guide him to its value. But in the  meantime, Stark had employed a friend to obtain for him the refusal of  it, and had undertaken to give for it a little more than any sum Sir  Charles might offer. On finding that at least L5 could be got for it,  Smith went to the chemist and gave him two guineas, and then sold it to  Stark's agent for seven guineas. Stark took it to London, and sold it at  once to the Rt. Hon. Thos. Grenville for seventy pounds or guineas.    \"I have now shortly to state how it came that a book without covers of  such extreme age was preserved. About fifty years since, the library  of Thonock Hall, in the parish of Gainsborough, the seat of the Hickman  family, underwent great repairs, the books being sorted over by a most  ignorant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13029"],[0,"The Art of the Moving Picture (#5)"],[1,"it would do for the souls of all your film artists if you  projected just such a museum as Denver is now projecting. Your fate is  coming toward you. Denver is halfway between Chicago, with the greatest  art institute in the country, and Los Angeles, the natural capital of the  photoplay. The art museums of America should rule the universities, and  the photoplay studios as well. In the art museums should be set the final  standards of civic life, rather than in any musty libraries or routine  classrooms. And the great weapon of the art museums of all the land  should be the hieroglyphic of the future, the truly artistic photoplay.    And now for book two, at length. It is a detailed analysis of the films,  first proclaimed in 1915, and never challenged or overthrown, and, for  the most part, accepted intact by the photoplay people, and the critics  and the theorists, as well.          BOOK II--THE UNCHALLENGED OUTLINE OF PHOTOPLAY CRITICAL METHOD    CHAPTER I    THE POINT OF VIEW      While there is a great deal of literary reference in all the following  argument, I realize, looking back over many attempts to paraphrase it for  various audiences, that its appeal is to those who spend the best part of  their student life in classifying, and judging, and producing works of  sculpture, painting, and architecture. I find the eyes of all others  wandering when I make talks upon the plastic artist's point of view.    This book tries to find that fourth dimension of architecture, painting,  and sculpture, which is the human soul in action, that arrow with wings  which is the flash of fire from the film, or the heart of man, or  Pygmalion's image, when it becomes a woman.    The 1915 edition was used by Victor O. Freeburg as one of the text-books  in the Columbia University School of Journalism, in his classes in  photoplay writing. I was invited several times to address those classes  on my yearly visits to New York. I have addressed many other academic  classes, the invitation being based on this book. Now I realize that  those who approach the theory from the general University standpoint, or  from the history of the drama, had best begin with Freeburg's book, for  he is not only learned in both matters, but presents the special  analogies with skill. Freeburg has an excellent education in the history  of music, and some of the happiest passages in his work relate the  photoplay to the musical theory of the world, as my book relates it to  the general Art Museum point of view of the world. Emphatically, my book  belongs in the Art Institutes as a beginning, or in such religious and  civic bodies as think architecturally. From there it must work its way  out. Of course those bodies touch on a thousand others.    The work is being used as one basis of the campaign for the New Denver  Art Museum, and I like to tell the story of how George W. Eggers of  Denver first began to apply the book when the Director of the Art  Institute, Chicago, that it may not seem to the merely University type of  mind a work of lost abstractions. One of the most gratifying recognitions  I ever received was the invitation to talk on the films in Fullerton  Hall, Chicago Art Institute. Then there came invitations to speak at  Chicago University, and before the Fortnightly Club, Chicago, all around  1916-17. One difficulty was getting the film to _prove_ my case from out  the commercial whirl. I talked at these three and other places, but  hardly knew how to go about crossing the commercial bridge. At last, with  the cooperation of Director Eggers, we staged, in the sacred precincts of  Fullerton Hall, Mae Marsh in The Wild Girl of the Sierras. The film was  in battered condition, and was turned so fast I could not talk with it  satisfactorily and fulfil the well-known principles of chapter fourteen.  But at least I had converted one Art Institute Director to the idea that  an ex-student of the Institute could not only write a book about  painting-in-motion, but the painting could be shown in an Art Museum as  promise of greater things in this world. It took a deal of will and  breaking of precedent, on the part of all concerned, to show this film,  The Wild Girl of the Sierras, and I retired from the field a long time.  But now this same Eggers is starting, in Denver, an Art Museum from its  very foundations, but on the same constructive scale. So this enterprise,  in my fond and fatuous fancy, is associated with the sweet Mae Marsh as  The Wild Girl of the Sierras--one of the loveliest bits of poetry ever  put into screen or fable.    For about one year, off and on, I had the honor to be the photoplay  critic of The New Republic, this invitation also based on the first  edition of this book. Looking back upon that experience I am delighted to  affirm that not only The New Republic constituency but the world of the  college and the university where I moved at that time, while at loss for  a policy, were not only willing but eager to take the films with  seriousness.    But when I was through with all these dashes into the field, and went  back to reciting verses again, no one had given me any light as to who  should make the disinterested, non-commercial film for these immediate  times, the film that would class, in our civilization, with The New  Republic or The Atlantic Monthly or the poems of Edwin Arlington  Robinson. That is, the production not for the trade, but for the soul.  Anita Loos, that good crusader, came out several years ago with the  flaming announcement that there was now hope, since a school of films had  been heavily endowed for the University of Rochester. The school was to  be largely devoted to producing music for the photoplay, in defiance of  chapter fourteen. But incidentally there were to be motion pictures made  to fit good music. Neither music nor films have as yet shaken the world.    I liked this Rochester idea. I felt that once it was started the films  would take their proper place and dominate the project, disinterested  non-commercial films to be classed with the dramas so well stimulated by  the great drama department under Professor Baker of Harvard.    As I look back over this history I see that the printed page had counted  too much, and the real forces of the visible arts in America had not been  definitely enlisted. They should take the lead. I would suggest as the  three people to interview first on building any Art Museum Photoplay  project: Victor Freeburg, with his long experience of teaching the  subject in Columbia, and John Emerson and Anita Loos, who are as brainy  as people dare to be and still remain in the department store film  business. No three people would more welcome opportunities to outline the  idealistic possibilities of this future art. And a well-known American  painter was talking to me of a midnight scolding Charlie Chaplin gave to  some Los Angeles producer, in a little restaurant, preaching the really  beautiful film, and denouncing commerce like a member of Coxey's  illustrious army. And I have heard rumors from all sides that Charlie  Chaplin has a soul. He is the comedian most often proclaimed an artist by  the fastidious, and most often forgiven for his slapstick. He is praised  for a kind of O. Henry double meaning to his antics. He is said to be  like one of O. Henry's misquotations of the classics. He looks to me like  that artist Edgar Poe, if Poe had been obliged to make millions laugh. I  do not like Chaplin's work, but I have to admit the good intentions and  the enviable laurels. Let all the Art Museums invite him in, as tentative  adviser, if not a chastened performer. Let him be given as good a chance  as Mae Marsh was given by Eggers in Fullerton Hall. Only let him come in  person, not in film, till we hear him speak, and consider his  suggestions, and make sure he has eaten of the mystic Amaranth Apples of  Johnny Appleseed.          CHAPTER II    THE PHOTOPLAY OF ACTION      Let us assume, friendly reader, that it is eight o'clock in the evening  when you make yourself comfortable in your den, to peruse this chapter. I  want to tell you about the Action Film, the simplest, the type most often  seen. In the mind of the habitue of the cheaper theatre it is the only  sort in existence. It dominates the slums, is announced there by red and  green posters of the melodrama sort, and retains its original elements,  more deftly handled, in places more expensive. The story goes at the  highest possible speed to be still credible. When it is a poor thing,  which is the case too often, the St. Vitus dance destroys the  pleasure-value. The rhythmic quality of the picture-motions is twitched  to death. In the bad photoplay even the picture of an express train more  than exaggerates itself. Yet when the photoplay chooses to behave it can  reproduce a race far more joyously than the stage. On that fact is based  the opportunity of this form. Many Action Pictures are indoors, but the  abstract theory of the Action Film is based on the out-of-door chase. You  remember the first one you saw where the policeman pursues the comical  tramp over hill and dale and across the town lots. You remember that  other where the cowboy follows the horse thief across the desert, spies  him at last and chases him faster, faster, faster, and faster, and  finally catches him. If the film was made in the days before the National  Board of Censorship, it ends with the cowboy cheerfully hanging the  villain; all details given to the last kick of the deceased.    One of the best Action Pictures is an old Griffith Biograph, recently  reissued, the story entitled \"Man's Genesis.\" In the time when  cave-men-gorillas had no weapons, Weak-Hands (impersonated by Robert  Harron) invents the stone club. He vanquishes his gorilla-like rival,  Brute-Force (impersonated by Wilfred Lucas). Strange but credible manners  and customs of the cave-men are detailed. They live in picturesque caves.  Their"]]]
