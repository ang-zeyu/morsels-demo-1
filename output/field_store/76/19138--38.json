This then is thy  prime duty now,--to gratify the Pandavas and disgrace Sakuni. If thou  wishest to restore to thy sons the good fortune they have lost, then, O  king, do thou speedily adopt this line of conduct. If thou dost not act  so, the Kurus will surely meet with destruction, for neither Bhimasena  nor Arjuna, if angry, will leave any of their foes unslain. What is  there in the world which is unattainable to those who cannot among their  warriors _Savyasachin_ skilled in arms; who have the Gandiva, the most  powerful of all weapons in the world, for their bow; and who have  amongst them the mighty Bhima also as a warrior? Formerly, as soon as  thy son was born, I told thee,--_Forsake thou this inauspicious child of  thine. Herein lieth the good of thy race._--But thou didst not then act  accordingly. Nor also, O king, have I pointed out to thee the way of thy  welfare. If thou doest as I have counselled, thou shalt not have to  repent afterwards. If thy son consent to reign in peace jointly with the  sons of Pandu, passing thy days in joy thou shalt not have to repent.  Should it be otherwise, abandon thou thy child for thy own happiness.  Putting Duryodhana aside, do thou install the son of Pandu in the  sovereignty, and let, O king, Ajatasatru, free from passion, rule the  earth virtuously. All the kings of the earth, then, like Vaisyas, will,  without delay, pay homage unto us. And, O king, let Duryodhana and  Sakuni and Karna with alacrity wait upon the Pandavas. And let  Dussasana, in open court, ask forgiveness of Bhimasena and of the  daughter of Drupada also. And do thou pacify Yudhishthira by placing him  on the throne with every mark of respect. Asked by thee, what else can I  counsel thee to do? By doing this, O monarch, thou wouldst do what was  proper.'    \"Dhritarashtra said, 'These words, O Vidura, then thou hast spoken in  this assembly, with reference to the Pandavas and myself, are for their  good but not for ours. My mind doth not approve them. How hast thou  settled all this in thy mind now? When thou hast spoken all this on  behalf of the Pandavas, I perceive that thou art not friendly to me. How  can I abandon my son for the sake of the sons of Pandu? Doubtless they  are my sons, but Duryodhana is sprung from my body. Who then, speaking  with impartiality, will ever counsel me to renounce my own body for the  sake of others? O Vidura, all that thou sayest is crooked, although I  hold thee in high esteem. Stay or go as thou likest. However much may  she be humoured, an unchaste will forsaketh her husband.'\"    Vaisampayana said, \"O king, saying this Dhritarashtra rose suddenly and  went into the inner apartments. And Vidura, saying 'This race is doomed'  went away to where the sons of Pritha were.\"      SECTION V    Vaisampayana said, \"Desirous of living in the forest, those bulls of the  Bharata race, the Pandavas, with their followers, setting out from the  banks of the Ganges went to the field of Kurukshetra. And performing  their ablutions in the Saraswati, the Drisadwati and the Yamuna, they  went from one forest to another, travelling in an westernly direction.  And at length they saw before them the woods, Kamyaka, the favourite  haunt of _Munis_, situated by a level and wild plain on the banks of the  Saraswati. And in those woods, O Bharata, abounding in birds and deer,  those heroes began to dwell, entertained and comforted by the Munis. And  Vidura always longing to see the Pandavas, went in a single car to the  Kamyaka woods abounding in every good thing. And arriving at Kamyaka on  a car drawn by swift steeds, he saw Yudhishthira the just, sitting with  Draupadi at a retired spot, surrounded by his brothers and the  Brahmanas. And seeing Vidura approach from a distance with swift steps,  the virtuous king addressed brother Bhimasena, saying, 'With what  message doth Kshatta come to us? Doth he come hither, despatched by  Sakuni, to invite us again to a game of dice? Doth the little-minded  Sakuni intend to win again our weapons at dice? O Bhimasena, challenged  by any one addressing me,--Come, I am unable to stay. And if our  possession of the _Gandiva_ becomes doubtful, will not the acquisition  of our kingdom also be so.'\"    Vaisampayana said, \"O king, the Pandavas then rose up and welcomed  Vidura. And received by them, that descendant of the Ajamida line  (Vidura) sat in their midst and made the usual enquiries. And after  Vidura had rested awhile, those bulls among men asked him the reason of  his coming. And Vidura began to relate unto them in detail everything  connected with the bearing of Dhritarashtra the son of Amvika.    \"Vidura said, 'O Ajatasatru, Dhritarashtra called me, his dependant,  before him and honouring me duly said, \"Things have fared thus. Now, do  thou tell me what is good for the Pandavas as well as for me.\" I pointed  out what was beneficial to both the Kauravas and Dhritarashtra. But what  I said was not relished by him, nor could I hit upon any other course.  What I advised was, O Pandavas, highly beneficial, but the son of Amvika  heeded me not. Even as medicine recommendeth itself not to one that is  ill, so my words failed to please the king. And, O thou without a foe,  as all unchaste wile in the family of a man of pure descent cannot be  brought back to the path of virtue, so I failed to bring Dhritarashtra  back. Indeed, as a young damsel doth not like a husband of three score,  even so Dhritarashtra did not like my words. Surely, destruction will  overtake the Kuru race, surely Dhritarashtra will never acquire good  fortune. For, as water dropped on a lotus-leaf doth not remain there, my  counsels will fail to produce any effect to Dhritarashtra. The incensed  Dhritarashira told me, O Bharata, go thou thither where thou likest.  Never more shall I seek thy aid in ruling the earth or my capital,--O  best of monarchs, forsaken by king Dhritarashtra, I come to thee for  tendering good counsel. What I had said in the open court, I will now  repeat unto thee. Listen, and bear my words in mind,--that wise man who  bearing all the gross wrong heaped upon him by his enemies, patiently  bideth his time, and multiplieth his resources even as men by degrees  turn a small fire into a large one, ruleth alone this entire earth. He  that (in prosperity) enjoyeth his substance with his adherents findeth  in them sharers of his adversity,--this is the best means of securing  adherents, and it is said that he that hath adherents, winneth the  sovereignty of the world! And, O Pandava, dividing thy prosperity with  thy adherents, behave truthfully towards them, and converse with them  agreeably! Share also your food with them! And never boast thyself in  their presence! This behaviour increaseth the prosperity of kings!'    \"Yudhishthira said, 'Having recourse to such high intelligence,  undisturbed by passion, I will do as thou counsellest! And whatever else  thou mayst counsel in respect of time and place, I will carefully follow  entirely.'\"      SECTION VI    Vaisampayana said, \"O king, after Vidura had gone to the abode of the  Pandavas, Dhritarashtra, O Bharata, of profound wisdom, repented of his  action. And thinking of the great intelligence of Vidura in matters  connected with both war and peace, and also of the aggrandisement of the  Pandavas in the future, Dhritarashtra, pained at the recollection of  Vidura, having approached the door of the hall of state fell down  senseless in the presence of the monarchs (in waiting). And regaining  consciousness, the king rose from the ground and thus addressed Sanjaya  standing by, 'My brother and friend is even like the god of justice  himself! Recollecting him today, my heart burneth in grief! Go, bring  unto me without delay my brother well-versed in morality!' Saying this,  the monarch wept bitterly. And burning in repentance, and overwhelmed  with sorrow at the recollection of Vidura, the king, from brotherly  affection, again addressed Sanjaya saying, 'O Sanjaya, go thou and  ascertain whether my brother, expelled by my wretched self through  anger, liveth still! That wise brother of mine of immeasurable  intelligence hath never been guilty of even the slightest transgression,  but, on the other hand, he it is who hath come by grievous wrong at my  hands! Seek him, O wise one, and bring him hither; else, O Sanjaya, I  will lay down my life!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Hearing these words of the king, Sanjaya  expressed his approbation, and saying 'So be it,' went in the direction  of the Kamyaka woods. And arriving without loss of time at the forest  where the sons of Pandu dwelt, he beheld Yudhishthira clad in deer-skin,  seated with Vidura, in the midst of Brahmanas by thousands and guarded  by his brothers, even like Purandara in the midst of the celestials! And  approaching Yudhishthira, Sanjaya worshipped him duly and was received  with due respect by Bhima and Arjuna and the twins. And Yudhishthira  made the usual enquiries about his welfare and when he had been seated  at his ease, he disclosed the reason of his visit, in these words, 'King  Dhritarashtra, the son of Amvika, hath, O Kshatta! remembered thee!  Returning unto him without loss of time, do thou revive the king! And, O  thou best of men, with the permission of these Kuru princes--these  foremost of men--it behoveth thee, at the command of that lion among  kings, to return unto him!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by Sanjaya, the intelligent  Vidura, ever attached to his relatives, with the permission of  Yudhishthira returned to the city named after the elephant. And after he  had approached the king, Dhritarashtra of great energy, the son of  Amvika, addressed him, saying, 'From my good luck alone, O Vidura, thou,  O sinless one, of conversant with morality, hast come here remembering  me!

The vision then fades and they  discover the new-born child crying at their side. They debate what to  do--Devaki urging Vasudeva to take the baby to Nanda's house where Rohini,  his other wife, is still living and where Yasoda will receive it. Vasudeva  is wondering how to escape when his handcuffs and chains fall off, the  doors open and the guards are seen to be asleep. Placing Krishna in a  basket, he puts it on his head and sets out for Gokula. As he goes, lions  roar, the rain pours down and the river Jumna faces him. There is no help  but to ford it and Vasudeva accordingly enters the stream. The water gets  higher and higher until it reaches his nose. When he can go no farther,  the infant Krishna stretches out a foot, calms the river and the water  subsides. Vasudeva now arrives at Nanda's house where he finds that Yasoda  has borne a girl and is in a trance. Vasudeva puts Krishna beside her,  takes up the baby girl, recrosses the river and joins Devaki in her  prison. The doors shut, the handcuffs and fetters close on them again and  as the baby starts to cry, the guards awake. A sentry then carries Kansa  the news. Kansa hurries to the spot, seizes the child and tries to dash it  on a stone. As he does so the child becomes the goddess Devi and  exclaiming that Kansa's enemy is born elsewhere and nothing can save him,  vanishes into heaven.[13] Kansa is greatly shaken and orders all male  children to be killed,[14] but releases Vasudeva and Devaki.    Meanwhile Nanda, the rich herdsman, is celebrating the birth. Pandits and  astrologers are sent for, the child's horoscope is cast and his destiny  foretold. He will be a second deity like Brahma himself. He will destroy  demons, relieve the land of Braj of all its cares, be called the lord of  the cowgirls and be praised the whole world over. Nanda promises to  dedicate cows, loads the Brahmans with presents, and summons all the  musicians and singers of the city. Singing, dancing and music break forth,  the courtyards throng with people, and the cowherds of Gokula come in with  their wives. On their heads are pitchers full of curd and as a magical  means of ensuring prosperity, they proceed to throw it over the  gathering. Nanda presents them with cloth and betel and they depart elated  at the news.    Some days later Nanda learns of Kansa's order to seize all male children  and, deeming it prudent to offer presents, he collects the cowherds in a  body and goes to Mathura to pay tribute. Kansa receives him and on his way  back Vasudeva meets him at the river. He dare not disclose his secret that  Krishna is not Nanda's son but his own. At the same time he cannot  suppress his anxiety as a father. He contents himself by telling Nanda  that demons and evil spirits are abroad seeking to destroy young children  and urges him to return to Gokula as quickly as possible.    The _Purana_ now concentrates on two main themes: on Krishna's infancy in  Gokula, dilating on his baby pranks, his capacity for mischief, the love  he arouses in the hearts of his foster-mother, Yasoda, and of all the  married cowgirls and, secondly, on his supernatural powers and skill in  ridding the country of troublesome demons. These are at first shown as  hostile to Krishna only, but as the story unfolds, his role gradually  widens and we see him acting as the cowherds' ally, protecting them from  harm, attacking the forces of evil and thus fulfilling the supreme purpose  for which he has been born. From time to time the cowherds realize that  Krishna is Vishnu and adore him as God. Then amnesia intervenes. They  retain no recollection of the vision and see him simply as a youthful  cowherd, charming in manner, whose skill in slaying demons arouses their  love. In this way Krishna lives among them--in fact, God, but in the eyes  of the people, a young boy.[15]    The first demon to threaten Krishna's life is a huge ogress named Putana.  Her role is that of child-killer--any child who is suckled in the night by  Putana instantly dying. Putana assumes the form of a sweet and charming  girl, dabs her breasts with poison and while Nanda is still at Mathura,  comes gaily to his house. Entranced by her appearance, Yasoda allows her  to hold the baby Krishna and then to suckle him. Krishna, however, is  impervious to the poison, and fastening his mouth to her breast, he begins  to suck her life out with the milk. Putana, feeling her life going, rushes  wildly from the village, but to no avail. Krishna continues sucking and  the ogress dies. When Yasoda and Rohini catch up with her, they find her  huge carcass lying on the ground with Krishna still sucking her breast.  'Taking him up quickly and kissing him, they pressed him to their bosoms  and hurried home.'    Nanda now arrives from Mathura and congratulates the cowherds on their  escape--so great was Putana's size that her body might have crushed and  overwhelmed the whole colony. He then arranges for her burning but as her  flesh is being consumed, a strange perfume is noticed for Krishna, when  killing her, had granted her salvation.    A second demon now intervenes. It is twenty-seven days since Krishna's  birth. Brahmans and cowherds have been summoned to a feast, the cowgirls  are singing songs and everyone is laughing and eating. Krishna for the  time being is out of their minds, having been put to sleep beneath a heavy  cart loaded with pitchers. A little later he wakes up, begins to cry for  the breast and finding no one there wriggles about and starts to suck a  toe. At this moment the demon, Saktasura, is flying through the sky. He  notices the child and alights on the cart. His weight cracks it but before  the cart can collapse, Krishna kicks out so sharply that the demon dies  and the cart falls to pieces. Hearing a great crash, the cowgirls dash to  the spot, marvelling that although the cart is in splinters and all the  pots broken, Krishna has survived.    The third attack occurs when Krishna is five months old. Yasoda is sitting  with him in her lap when she notices that he has suddenly become very  heavy. At the same time, the whirlwind demon, Trinavarta, raises a great  storm. The sky darkens, trees are uprooted and thatch dislodged. As Yasoda  sets Krishna down, Trinavarta seizes him and whirls him into the air.  Yasoda finds him suddenly gone and calls out, 'Krishna, Krishna.' The  cowgirls and cowherds join her in the search, peering for him in the gusty  gloom of the dark storm. Full of misery, they search the forest and can  find him nowhere. Krishna, riding through the air, however, can see their  distress. He twists Trinavarta round, forces him down and dashes him to  death against a stone. As he does so, the storm lightens, the wind drops  and the cowherds and cowgirls regain their homes. There they discover a  demon lying dead with Krishna playing on its chest. Filled with relief,  Yasoda picks him up and hugs him to her breast.    Vasudeva now instructs his family priest, Garga the sage, to go to Gokula,  meet Nanda and give Krishna and Balarama proper names. Rohini, he points  out, has had a son, Balarama, and Nanda has also had a son, Krishna. It is  time that each should be formally named. The sage is delighted to receive  the commission and on arriving is warmly welcomed. He declines, however,  to announce the children's names in public, fearing that his connection  with Vasudeva will cause Raja Kansa to connect Krishna with the eighth  child--his fated enemy. Nanda accordingly takes him inside his house and  there the sage names the two children. Balarama is given seven names, but  Krishna's names, he declares, are numberless. Since, however, Krishna was  once born in Vasudeva's house, he is called Vasudeva. As to their  qualities, the sage goes on, both are gods. It is impossible to understand  their state, but having killed Kansa, they will remove the burdens of the  world. He then goes silently away. This is the first time that Nanda and  Yasoda are told the true facts of Krishna's birth. They do not, however,  make any comment and for the time being it is as if they are still quite  ignorant of Krishna's destiny. They continue to treat him as their son and  no hint escapes them of his true identity.    Meanwhile Krishna, along with Rohini's son, Balarama, is growing up as a  baby. He crawls about the courtyard, lisps his words, plays with toys and  pulls the calves' tails, Yasoda and Rohini all the time showering upon him  their doting love. When he can walk, Krishna starts to go about with other  children and there then ensues a series of naughty pranks. His favourite  pastime is to raid the houses of the cowgirls, pilfer their cream and  curds, steal butter and upset milk pails. When, as sometimes happens, the  butter is hung from the roof, they pile up some of the household  furniture. One of the boys then mounts upon it, another climbs on his  shoulders, and in this way gets the butter down.[16] As the pilfering  increases, the married cowgirls learn that Krishna is the ringleader and  contrive one day to catch him in the act. 'You little thief,' they say,  'At last we've caught you. So it's you who took our butter and curds. You  won't escape us now.' And taking him by the hand they march him to Yasoda.  Krishna, however, is not to be outwitted. Employing his supernatural  powers, he substitutes the cowgirls' own sons for himself and while they  go to Yasoda, himself slips off and joins his playmates in the fields.  When the cowgirls reach Yasoda, they complain of Krishna's thefts and tell  her that at last they have caught him and here he is. Yasoda answers, 'But  this is not Krishna. These are your own sons.' The cowgirls look at the  children, discover the trick, are covered in confusion and burst out  laughing. Yasoda then sends for Krishna and forbids him to steal from  other people's houses. Krishna pretends to be highly indignant. He calls  the cowgirls liars "]]]
