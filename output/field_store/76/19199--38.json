The Vice  Chancellor has decided that the bequest is void, for the reason that  such an essay would encourage people to emigrate to the United States,  and so to throw off their allegiance to the Queen! Another decision  equally wise was made at the same time in regard to a prize for a  treatise on Natural Theology. The learned Vice Chancellor regarded it  as calculated to \"subvert the Church.\"           *       *       *       *       *          RECENT DEATHS.           *       *       *       *       *    ROBERT EGLESFELD GRIFFITH, M.D., died in Philadelphia, on the 27th  ult., in the fifty-third year of his age. Dr. Griffith possessed fine  talents; in addition to a thorough knowledge of his profession, he was  familiar with most of the branches of natural science, while in botany  and conchology he stood second to few in this country; and his social  and moral qualities were of the highest order. He filled in succession  the chairs of Materia Medica and Pharmacy in the Philadelphia College  of Pharmacy; of Materia Medica, Therapeutics, Hygiene, and Medical  Jurisprudence in the University of Virginia. Whilst laboring in the  latter station his health failed him, and he was induced to seek a  winters residence in the West Indies in hopes of its restoration. It  became evident, however, that his health was permanently broken, and  for the last four years he has resided in his native city, Though  suffering much, his energy and industry never flagged: and he  has given the results of his labors in his Medical Botany and his  Universal Formulary, two works which will secure him a permanent  reputation. He also enriched by his annotations a number of works  republished in this country, among which we may mention Christison's  Dispensatory, Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence, Ryan's Medical  Jurisprudence, Ballard and Garrod's Materia Medica.           *       *       *       *       *    F. MANSELL REYNOLDS, the eldest son of the late F. Reynolds, the  dramatic author, died recently at Fontainebleau. He was long intimate  with and favorably known to literary circles in England, counting such  men as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Bernal, Lockhart, Hook, and many others,  among his personal friends. As the editor of \"Heath's Keepsake,\"  when it started, he proved himself a person of taste and ability. He  was also the author of \"Miserrimus,\" which excited a considerable  sensation when published, and of one or two other works of fiction,  which, together with his contributions to several serials, displayed  much variety of talent.           *       *       *       *       *    JOHN ROBY, author of \"Traditions of Lancashire,\" and other works,  which have been as popular as any of their class, is mentioned as one  of the persons lost in the \"Orion\" steamer. Mr. Roby was long a banker  in Rochdale, and partner of Mr. Fielden, and though an excellent man  of business, his mind was deeply interested in literary pursuits and  in cultivating the friendly intercourse of literary men.           *       *       *       *       *    Prof. CANSTATT, of the University of Erlangen, died on the 10th of  March, after a long and painful illness. Dr. C. was one of the most  distinguished physicians of our times, and had won for himself a  lasting reputation by his work on the diseases of old age.           *       *       *       *       *          ORIGINAL POETRY           *       *       *       *       *    The following graphic picture of domestic happiness in humble  life, was written by Townsend Haines, Esq., late Secretary of the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and now Register of the Treasury, at  Washington. Mr. Haines is an eloquent and accomplished lawyer, with  fine capacities for literature, to which it may be regretted that he  has recently given so little attention.      BOB FLETCHER      I once knew a plowman, Bob Fletcher his name,    Who was old and was ugly, and so was his dame;    Yet they lived quite contented, and free from all strife,    Bob Fletcher the plowman, and Judy his wife.      As the morn streaked the east, and the night fled away    They would rise up for labor, refreshed for the day,    And the song of the lark, as it rose on the gale,    Found Bob at the plow, and his wife at the pail.      A neat little cottage in front of a grove,    Where in youth they first gave their young hearts up to love,    Was the solace of age, and to them doubly dear,    As it called up the past, with a smile or a tear.      Each tree had its thought, and the vow could impart,    That mingled in youth, the warm wish of the heart:    The thorn was still there, and the blossoms it bore,    And the song from its top seemed the same as before.      When the curtain of night over nature was spread,    And Bob had returned from the plow to his shed,    Like the dove on her nest, he reposed from all care,    If his wife and his youngsters contented were there.      I have passed by his door when the evening was gray,    And the hill and the landscape were fading away,    And have heard from the cottage, with grateful surprise,    The voice of thanksgiving, like incense arise.      And I thought on the proud, who look down with scorn,    On the neat little cottage, the grove and the thorn,    And felt that the riches and tinsels of life,    Were dross, to contentment, with Bob and his wife.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM DICKENS'S HOUSEHOLD WORDS.]    CLASS OPINIONS.    A FABLE.    A lamb strayed for the first time into the woods, and excited much  discussion among the other animals. In a mixed company, one day, when  he became the subject of a friendly gossip, the goat praised him.    \"Pooh!\" said the lion, \"this is too absurd. The beast is a pretty  beast enough, but did you hear him roar? I heard him roar, and, by the  manes of my fathers, when he roars he does nothing but cry ba-a-a!\"  And the lion bleated his best in mockery, but bleated far from well.    \"Nay,\" said the deer, \"I do not think so badly of his voice. I liked  him well enough until I saw him leap. He kicks with his hind legs in  running and, with all his skipping, gets over very little ground.\"    \"It is a bad beast altogether,\" said the tiger. \"He cannot roar,  he cannot run, he can do nothing--and what wonder? I killed a man  yesterday, and, in politeness to the new comer, offered him a bit;  upon which he had the impudence to look disgusted, and say, 'No, sir,  I eat nothing but grass.'\"    So the beasts criticized the lamb, each in his own way; and yet it was  a good lamb, nevertheless.           *       *       *       *       *          AUTHORS AND BOOKS.           *       *       *       *       *    E.P. WHIPPLE was the Fourth of July orator of the city of Boston. The  _Morning Post_ says, \"his ability is so agile, elegant, and hilarious,  that his readers generally do not discern the profundity and  comprehensiveness of his nature or the progressive power of thought  manifested in his writings. We await impatiently the publication  of his late oration. It will be an apt opportunity, by the way, to  compare Mr. E. Everett with him, each having just spoken on a similar  national occasion. His level, 'fairspoken, immaculate regularity' will  contrast widely with the bold, vital vigor and originality of Mr. W.  No man of constitutional timidity, feeble will, and shallow thought  can ever have a real right to the title of orator. Men of minds  cultivated overmuch, and elaborately trained, are apt to lack central  spiritual vitality, as some fruits grown to great size by art of  the gardener fail of their native flavor, become insipid, and even  _hollow_ at the center.\"           *       *       *       *       *    THE \"HISTORY OF RELIGION,\" by the celebrated John Evelyn, author of  \"Sylva,\" &c., now first published from the original MS. in the Library  at Wotton, with notes by the Rev. R.M. Evanson, is among the books  announced by Colburn, for the first of July. The journals, in  anticipation, express some curiosity upon the subject, whether it  be pedantic, orthodox, and trimming, like the author, or whether it  contain any of the Chubb and Toland spirit. Two new and important  works, ethically related to this, have just been issued; the one  in France, called _Qu'est-ce que la Religion, d'apres la Nouvelle  Philosophie Allemande_, wherein Feuerbach's daring evolutions of  Hegel's principles are translated for the benefit of those who cannot  read German; the other, called _The Progress of Intellect_, showing  the various developments of religious ideas through history.           *       *       *       *       *    LEIGH HUNT, it is apprehended, will be appointed laureate. The  _Athenaeum_ objects, and we think very properly urges, that if the  office is to be continued, it should be given to the finest living  poet of her Majesty's own sex, Elizabeth Barrett Browning. This  appropriation of the laurel would in a manner recompense two poets  by a single act.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. ROBERT LEMON, of the State Paper Office, to whom we are indebted  for the discovery of the MS. of Milton's Treatise on Christian  Doctrine, is to be editor of an extensive publication of Calendars of  the Domestic Papers in possession of the Government, from the reign  of Edward the Sixth to the close of the reign of Elizabeth.

Dr. Gutzlaff  expresses a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13056"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 10 (#5)"],[1,"the shallowness and  worthlessness of my aim in life became more vivid than ever. Through  the advice of others, and through my own impulse, I was brought to the  point of reading the Scriptures more consecutively and with resolute  restraint, sometimes, of my own judgment. That which stirred within me  came to life when the news of the fatal illness of our late friend in  Cardemin tore the first ardent prayer from my heart, without subtle  questionings as to its reasonableness. God did not grant my prayer on  that occasion; neither did He utterly reject it, for I have never  again lost the capacity to bring my requests to Him, and I feel within  me, if not peace, at least confidence and courage such as I never knew  before.    I do not know what value you will attach to this emotion, which my  heart has felt for only two months; I only hope that it may not be  lost, whatever your decision in regard to me may be--a hope of which I  could give you no better assurance than by undeviating frankness and  loyalty in that which I have now disclosed to you, and to no one else  hitherto, with the conviction that God favors the sincere.    I refrain from any assurance of my feelings and purposes with  reference to your daughter, for the step I am taking speaks of them  louder and more eloquently than words can. So, too, no promises for  the future would be of service to you, since you know the  untrustworthiness of the human heart better than I, and the only  security I offer for the welfare of your daughter lies in my prayer  for God's blessing. As a matter of history I would only observe that,  after I had seen fraeulein Johanna repeatedly in Cardemin, after the  trip we made together this summer, I have only been in doubt as to  whether the attainment of my desires would be reconcilable with the  happiness and peace of your daughter, and whether my self-confidence  was not greater than my ability when I believed that she could find in  me what she would have a right to look for in her husband. Very  recently, however, together with my reliance on God's grace, the  resolution which I now carry out has also become fixed in me, and I  kept silent when I saw you in Zimmerhausen only because I had more to  say than I could express in conversation. In view of the importance of  the matter and the great sacrifice which it will involve for you and  your wife in separation from your daughter, I can scarcely hope that  you will give a favorable decision at once, and only beg that you will  not refuse me an opportunity for explanation upon any considerations  which might dispose you to reject my suit, before you utter a positive  refusal.    There is doubtless a great deal that I have not said, or not said  fully enough, in this letter, and I am, of course, ready to give you  exact and faithful information as to everything you may desire to  know; I think I have told what is most important.    I beg you to convey to your wife my respectful compliments, and to  accept kindly the assurance of my love and esteem.    BISMARCK.      Schoenhausen, February 1, '47.    I had only waited for daylight to write you, my dear heart, and with  the light came your little green spirit-lamp to make my lukewarm water  seethe--though this time it found it ready to boil over. Your pity for  my restless nights at present is premature, but I shall give you  credit for it. The Elbe still lies turbid and growling in her  ice-bonds: the spring's summons to burst them is not yet loud enough  for her. I say to the weather: \"If you would only be cold or warm! But  you stay continually at freezing-point, and at this rate the matter  may long drag on.\" For the present my activity is limited to sending  out, far and wide, from the warm seat at the writing-table, diverse  conjurations, whose magic starts quantities of fascines, boards,  wheelbarrows, etc., from inland towards the Elbe, perchance to serve  as a prosaic dam in restraint of the poetical foaming of the flood.  After I had spent the morning in this useful rather than agreeable  correspondence, my resolve was to chat away comfortably through the  evening with you, beloved one, as though we were sitting on the sofa  in the red drawing-room; and with sympathetic attention to my desire  the mail kept for my enjoyment precisely at this gossiping hour your  letter, which I should have received by good rights day before  yesterday. You know, if you were able to decipher my inexcusably  scrawled note [3] from Schlawe, how I struck a half-drunken crowd of  hussar officers there, who disturbed me in my writing. In the train  I had, with my usual bad luck, a lady _vis-a-vis,_ and beside me two  very stout, heavily fur-clad passengers, the nearer of whom was a  direct descendant of Abraham into the bargain, and put me in a bitter  humor against all his race by a disagreeable movement of his left  elbow.    I found my brother in his dressing-gown, and he employed the five  minutes of our interview very completely, according to his habit, in  emptying a woolsack full of vexatious news about Kniephof before me:  disorderly inspectors, a lot of damaged sheep, distillers drunk every  day, thoroughbred colts (the prettiest, of course) come to grief, and  rotten potatoes, fell in a rolling torrent from his obligingly opened  mouth upon my somewhat travel-worn self. On my brother's account I  must affect and utter some exclamations of terror and complaint, for  my indifferent manner on receiving news of misfortune vexes him, and  as long as I do not express surprise he has ever new and still worse  news in stock. This time he attained his object, at least in my inner  man, and when I took my seat next to the Jewish elbow in green fur I  was in a right bad humor; especially the colt distressed me--an animal  as pretty as a picture and three years old.    Not before getting out of doors did I become conscious of the  ingratitude of my heart, and the thought of the unmerited happiness  that had become mine a fortnight earlier again won the mastery in me.  In Stettin I found drinking, gambling friends. William Ramin took  occasion to say, _apropos_ of a remark about reading the Bible, \"Tut!  In Reinfeld I'd speak like that, too, if I were in your place, but to  believe you can impose on your oldest acquaintances is amusing.\" I  found my sister very well and full of joy about you and me. She wrote  to you, I think, before she received your letter. Arnim is full of  anxiety lest I become \"pious.\" He kept looking at me all the time  earnestly and thoughtfully, with sympathetic concern, as one looks at  a dear friend whom one would like to save and yet almost gives up for  lost. I have seldom seen him so tender. Very clever people have a  curious manner of viewing the world. In the evening (I hope you did  not write so late) I drank your health in the foaming grape-juice of  Sillery, in company with half a dozen Silesian counts, Schaffgotsch  and others, at the Hotel de Rome, and convinced myself Friday morning  that the ice on the Elbe was still strong enough to bear my horse's  weight, and that, so far as the freshet was concerned, I might today  be still at your blue or black side[4] if other current official  engagements had not also claimed my presence. Snow has fallen very  industriously all day long, and the country is white once more,  without severe cold. When I arrived it was all free from snow on this  side of Brandenburg; the air was warm and the people were ploughing;  it was as though I had traveled out of winter into opening spring, and  yet within me the short springtime had changed to winter, for the  nearer I came to Schoenhausen the more oppressive I found the thought  of entering upon the old loneliness once more, for who knows how long.  Pictures of a wasted past arose in me as though they would banish me  from you. I was on the verge of tears, as when, after a school  vacation, I caught sight of Berlin's towers from the train.    The comparison of my situation with that in which I was on the 10th,  when I traveled the same line in the opposite direction; the  conviction that my solitude was, strictly speaking, voluntary, and  that I could at any time, albeit through a resolve smacking of  insubordination and a forty hours' journey, put an end to it, made me  see once more that my heart is ungrateful, dismayed, and resentful;  for soon I said to myself, in the comfortable fashion of the accepted  lover, that even here I am no longer lonely, and I was happy in the  consciousness of being loved by you, my angel, and, in return for the  gift of your love, of belonging to you, not merely in vassalage, but  with my inmost heart. On reaching the village I felt more distinctly  than ever before what a beautiful thing it is to have a home--a home  with which one is identified by birth, memory, and love. The sun shone  bright on the stately houses of the villagers, and their portly  inmates in long coats and the gayly dressed women in short skirts gave  me a much more friendly greeting than usual; on every face there  seemed to be a wish for my happiness, which I invariably converted  into thanks to you. Gray-haired Bellin's[5] fat face wore a broad  smile, and the trusty old soul shed tears as he patted me paternally  on the back and expressed his satisfaction; his wife, of course, wept  most violently; even Odin was more demonstrative than usual, and his  paw on my coat-collar proved incontestably that it was muddy weather.  Half an hour later Miss Breeze was galloping with me on the Elbe,  manifestly proud to carry your affianced, for never before did she so  scornfully smite the earth with her hoof. Fortunately you cannot  judge, my heart, in what a mood of dreary dulness I used to reenter my  house after a journey; what depression overmastered me when the door  of my room yawned at me and the mute furniture in the silent  apartments confronted me, bored like myself. The emptiness of my  existence was"]]]
