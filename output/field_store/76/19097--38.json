As between his own happiness and  that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial  as a disinterested and benevolent spectator. In the golden rule of Jesus  of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility. To  do as one would be done by, and to love one's neighbour as oneself,  constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality. As the means of  making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin, first,  that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness, or (as  speaking practically it may be called) the interest, of every  individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the  whole; and secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a  power over human character, should so use that power as to establish in  the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own  happiness and the good of the whole; especially between his own  happiness and the practice of such modes of conduct, negative and  positive, as regard for the universal happiness prescribes: so that not  only he may be unable to conceive the possibility of happiness to  himself, consistently with conduct opposed to the general good, but also  that a direct impulse to promote the general good may be in every  individual one of the habitual motives of action, and the sentiments  connected therewith may fill a large and prominent place in every human  being's sentient existence. If the impugners of the utilitarian morality  represented it to their own minds in this its true character, I know not  what recommendation possessed by any other morality they could possibly  affirm to be wanting to it: what more beautiful or more exalted  developments of human nature any other ethical system can be supposed to  foster, or what springs of action, not accessible to the utilitarian,  such systems rely on for giving effect to their mandates.    The objectors to utilitarianism cannot always be charged with  representing it in a discreditable light. On the contrary, those among  them who entertain anything like a just idea of its disinterested  character, sometimes find fault with its standard as being too high for  humanity. They say it is exacting too much to require that people shall  always act from the inducement of promoting the general interests of  society. But this is to mistake the very meaning of a standard of  morals, and to confound the rule of action with the motive of it. It is  the business of ethics to tell us what are our duties, or by what test  we may know them; but no system of ethics requires that the sole motive  of all we do shall be a feeling of duty; on the contrary, ninety-nine  hundredths of all our actions are done from other motives, and rightly  so done, if the rule of duty does not condemn them. It is the more  unjust to utilitarianism that this particular misapprehension should be  made a ground of objection to it, inasmuch as utilitarian moralists have  gone beyond almost all others in affirming that the motive has nothing  to do with the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the  agent. He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally  right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his  trouble: he who betrays the friend that trusts him, is guilty of a  crime, even if his object be to serve another friend to whom he is under  greater obligations.[B] But to speak only of actions done from the  motive of duty, and in direct obedience to principle: it is a  misapprehension of the utilitarian mode of thought, to conceive it as  implying that people should fix their minds upon so wide a generality as  the world, or society at large. The great majority of good actions are  intended, not for the benefit of the world, but for that of individuals,  of which the good of the world is made up; and the thoughts of the most  virtuous man need not on these occasions travel beyond the particular  persons concerned, except so far as is necessary to assure himself that  in benefiting them he is not violating the rights--that is, the  legitimate and authorized expectations--of any one else. The  multiplication of happiness is, according to the utilitarian ethics, the  object of virtue: the occasions on which any person (except one in a  thousand) has it in his power to do this on an extended scale, in other  words, to be a public benefactor, are but exceptional; and on these  occasions alone is he called on to consider public utility; in every  other case, private utility, the interest or happiness of some few  persons, is all he has to attend to. Those alone the influence of whose  actions extends to society in general, need concern themselves  habitually about so large an object. In the case of abstinences  indeed--of things which people forbear to do, from moral considerations,  though the consequences in the particular case might be beneficial--it  would be unworthy of an intelligent agent not to be consciously aware  that the action is of a class which, if practised generally, would be  generally injurious, and that this is the ground of the obligation to  abstain from it. The amount of regard for the public interest implied in  this recognition, is no greater than is demanded by every system of  morals; for they all enjoin to abstain from whatever is manifestly  pernicious to society.    The same considerations dispose of another reproach against the doctrine  of utility, founded on a still grosser misconception of the purpose of a  standard of morality, and of the very meaning of the words right and  wrong. It is often affirmed that utilitarianism renders men cold and  unsympathizing; that it chills their moral feelings towards  individuals; that it makes them regard only the dry and hard  consideration of the consequences of actions, not taking into their  moral estimate the qualities from which those actions emanate. If the  assertion means that they do not allow their judgment respecting the  rightness or wrongness of an action to be influenced by their opinion of  the qualities of the person who does it, this is a complaint not against  utilitarianism, but against having any standard of morality at all; for  certainly no known ethical standard decides an action to be good or bad  because it is done by a good or a bad man, still less because done by an  amiable, a brave, or a benevolent man or the contrary. These  considerations are relevant, not to the estimation of actions, but of  persons; and there is nothing in the utilitarian theory inconsistent  with the fact that there are other things which interest us in persons  besides the rightness and wrongness of their actions. The Stoics,  indeed, with the paradoxical misuse of language which was part of their  system, and by which they strove to raise themselves above all concern  about anything but virtue, were fond of saying that he who has that has  everything; that he, and only he, is rich, is beautiful, is a king. But  no claim of this description is made for the virtuous man by the  utilitarian doctrine. Utilitarians are quite aware that there are other  desirable possessions and qualities besides virtue, and are perfectly  willing to allow to all of them their full worth. They are also aware  that a right action does not necessarily indicate a virtuous character,  and that actions which are blameable often proceed from qualities  entitled to praise. When this is apparent in any particular case, it  modifies their estimation, not certainly of the act, but of the agent.  I grant that they are, notwithstanding, of opinion, that in the long run  the best proof of a good character is good actions; and resolutely  refuse to consider any mental disposition as good, of which the  predominant tendency is to produce bad conduct. This makes them  unpopular with many people; but it is an unpopularity which they must  share with every one who regards the distinction between right and wrong  in a serious light; and the reproach is not one which a conscientious  utilitarian need be anxious to repel.    If no more be meant by the objection than that many utilitarians look on  the morality of actions, as measured by the utilitarian standard, with  too exclusive a regard, and do not lay sufficient stress upon the other  beauties of character which go towards making a human being loveable or  admirable, this may be admitted. Utilitarians who have cultivated their  moral feelings, but not their sympathies nor their artistic perceptions,  do fall into this mistake; and so do all other moralists under the same  conditions. What can be said in excuse for other moralists is equally  available for them, namely, that if there is to be any error, it is  better that it should be on that side. As a matter of fact, we may  affirm that among utilitarians as among adherents of other systems,  there is every imaginable degree of rigidity and of laxity in the  application of their standard: some are even puritanically rigorous,  while others are as indulgent as can possibly be desired by sinner or by  sentimentalist. But on the whole, a doctrine which brings prominently  forward the interest that mankind have in the repression and prevention  of conduct which violates the moral law, is likely to be inferior to no  other in turning the sanctions of opinion against such violations. It is  true, the question, What does violate the moral law? is one on which  those who recognise different standards of morality are likely now and  then to differ. But difference of opinion on moral questions was not  first introduced into the world by utilitarianism, while that doctrine  does supply, if not always an easy, at all events a tangible and  intelligible mode of deciding such differences.

The misery to which the poor people  were reduced, may perhaps palliate the shame of acceding to this  extraordinary proposition; but, be this as it may, they consented  to surrender up their daughter for the sum of 1,500 piastres, and Sophia  was that same day conducted to the ambassador's palace. She found in the  Marquess de Vauban a kind and liberal benefactor. He engaged masters to  instruct her in every branch of education; and elegant accomplishments,  added to her natural charms, rendered her an object of irresistible  attraction.    In the course of a few months the ambassador was called home, and he set  out, accompanied by his Oriental treasure, to travel to France by land.  To diminish as far as possible the fatigue of the long journey, they  proceeded by short stages, and having passed through European Turkey,  they arrived at Kaminieck in Podolia, which is the first fortress  belonging to Russia. Here the Marquess determined to rest for a short  time, before undertaking the remainder of his tedious journey.    Count de Witt, a descendant of the Grand Pensionary of Holland, who was  governor of the place, received his noble visiter with every mark of  attention. The Count, however, no sooner beheld Sophia, than he became  deeply enamoured of her; and on learning the equivocal situation in  which she stood, being neither a slave nor a mistress, but, as it were,  a piece of merchandize purchased for 1,500 piastres, he wound up his  declaration of love by an offer of marriage. The Count was a handsome  man, scarcely thirty years of age, a lieutenant-general in the Russian  service, and enjoying the high favour of his sovereign Catherine II.  The fair Greek, as may well be imagined, did not reject this favour  of fortune, but accepted the offer of her suitor without hesitation.    It was easy to foresee that the Marquis de Vauban would not be very  willing to part with a prize which he regarded as lawfully acquired,  and to which he attached no small value. The Count therefore found it  advisable to resort to stratagem. Accordingly, his Excellency having one  day taken a ride beyond the ramparts, the draw-bridges were raised,  and the lovers repaired to church, where their hands were joined by a  _papa_. When the Marquess appeared at the gates of the fortress and  demanded admittance, a messenger was sent out to inform him of what had  happened; and, to complete the denouement of the comedy, the marriage  contract was exhibited to him in due form.    To save Sophia from the reproaches which her precipitancy, it may  perhaps be said her ingratitude, would have fully justified, the Count  directed the ambassador's suite to pack up their baggage, and join his  Excellency _extra muros_. The poor Marquess soon discovered that  it was quite useless to stay where he was, for the purpose of venting  threats and complaints; and he had no hope that the Court of France  would think it worth while to go to war, for the sake of avenging his  affront. He therefore prudently took a hint from one of the French  poets, who says:--      Le bruit est pour le fat, la plainte pour le sot,    L'honnete homme trompe, s'eloigne, et ne dit mot;\"      and he set off, doubtless with the secret determination never again to  traffic in merchandize which possesses no value when it can be either  bought or sold.    About two years after his marriage, the Count de Witt obtained leave of  absence, and, accompanied by his wife, he visited the different courts  of Europe. Sophia's beauty, which derived piquancy from a certain  Oriental languishment of manner, was every where the theme of  admiration. The Prince de Ligne, who saw her at the Court of France,  mentions her in his Memoirs, in terms of eulogy, which I cannot think  exaggerated; for when I knew her at Tulczin, though she was then upwards  of forty, her charms retained all their lustre, and she outshone the  young beauties of the court, amidst whom she appeared like Calypso  surrounded by her nymphs.    I now arrive at the second period of Sophia's life, which forms a sequel  perfectly in unison with the commencement. Count Felix Patocka, at the  commencement of the troubles in Poland, raised a considerable party by  the influence of his rank and vast fortune. During a temporary absence  from the Court of Poland, he made a tour through Italy, and on his  return, he met the Count and Countess de Witt at Hamburgh, when he fell  deeply in love with Sophia. Not to weary you with the details of the  romance, I will come to the _denouement_ at once.    Nothing is so easy as to obtain a divorce in Poland. The law extends  so far on this point, that I knew a gentleman, M. Wortrel, who had no  less than four wives, all living, and bearing his name. Count Patocka,  therefore, availing himself of this advantage, and having previously  made every necessary arrangement, one morning called on Count de Witt,  and, without further ceremony, said--\"Count, I love your wife, and  cannot live without her. I know that I am not indifferent to her;  and I might immediately carry her off; but I wish to owe my happiness  to you, and to retain for ever a grateful sense of your generosity.  Here are two papers: one is an act of divorce, which only wants your  signature, for you see the Countess has already affixed hers to it;--the  other is a bond for two millions of florins, payable at my banker's, in  this city. We may, therefore, settle the business amicably or otherwise,  just as you please.\" The husband doubtless thought of his adventure at  the fortress of Kaminieck, and, like the French ambassador, he resigned  himself to his fate, and signed the paper. The fair Sophia became, the  same day, Countess Patocka; and to the charms of beauty and talent, were  now added the attractions of a fortune, the extent of which was at that  time unequalled in Europe.--_Court Journal_.           *       *       *       *       *          Retrospective Gleanings.           *       *       *       *      JOHN LOCKE.      Lord King has just done the state of literature some service, by the  publication of the _Life of John Locke_: with Extracts from his  Journals, &c. In this task his lordship has drawn largely on some  valuable papers of Locke, preserved by their having gone into the  possession of Sir Peter King, the ancestor of Lord King, his near  relation and sole executor. Among these treasures are Locke's  correspondence, a journal of his travels in France and Holland, his  common-place book, and many miscellaneous papers; all of which have been  preserved in the same scrutoire in which they had been deposited by  their author, and which was probably removed to Oakham, (Lord King's  seat,) in 1710. From the latter portion of Lord King's valuable work,  we select a few notes, illustrative of Manners and Customs in    ENGLAND, 1679.    The sports of England, which, perhaps, a curious stranger would be glad  to see, are horse-racing, hawking, and hunting; bowling,--at Marebone  and Putney he may see several persons of quality bowling, two or three  times a week all the summer; wrestling, in Lincoln's Inne Field every  evening all the summer; bear and bull-baiting, and sometimes prizes,  at the Bear-Garden; shooting in the long-bow and stob-ball, in Tothil  Fields; cudgel-playing, in several places in the country; and hurling,  in Cornwall. _London_.--See the East India House, and their  magazines; the Custom House; the Thames, by water, from London Bridge  to Deptford; and the King's Yard at Deptford; the sawing-windmill;  Tradescant's garden and closet; Sir James Morland's closet and  water-works; the iron mills at Wandsworth, four miles above London, upon  the Thames; or rather those in Sussex; Paradise by Hatton Garden; the  glass-house at the Savoy, and at Vauxhall. Eat fish in Fish Street,  especially lobsters, Colchester oysters, and a fresh cod's head. The  veal and beef are excellent good in London; the mutton better in several  counties in England. A venison pasty and a chine of beef are good  every where; and so are crammed capons and fat chickens. Railes and  heathpolts, ruffs, and reeves, are excellent meat wherever they can be  met with. Puddings of several sorts, and creams of several fashions,  both excellent; but they are seldom to be found, at least in their  perfection, at common eating-houses. Mango and saio are two sorts of  sauces brought from the East Indies. Bermuda oranges and potatoes,  both exceeding good in their kind. Chedder and Cheshire cheese.  Men excellent in their arts. Mr. Cox, in Long Acre, for all sorts  of dioptical glasses. Mr. Opheel, near the Savoy, for all sorts of  machines. Mr. ----, for a new invention he has, and teaches to copy all  sorts of pictures, plans, or to take prospects of places. The King's  gunsmith, at the Yard by Whitehall. Mr. Not, in the Pall Mall, for  binding of books. The Fire-eater. At an iron-monger's, near the  May-pole, in the Strand, is to be found a great variety of iron  instruments, and utensils of all kinds. At Bristol see the Hot-well;  St. George's Cave, where the Bristol diamonds are found; Ratcliff  Church; and at Kingwood, the coal-pits. Taste there Milford oysters,  marrow-puddings, cock-ale, metheglin, white and red-muggets, elvers,  sherry, sack (which, with sugar, is called Bristol milk,) and some  other wines, which, perhaps you will not drink so good at London. At  Gloucester observe the whispering place in the cathedral. At Oxford see  all the colleges, and their libraries; the schools and public library,  and the physic-garden. Buy there knives and gloves, especially white  kid-skin; and the cuts of all the colleges graved by Loggins. If you go  into the North, see the Peak in Derbyshire, described by Hobbes, in a  Latin poem, called \"Mirabilia Pecci.\" Home-made drinks of England are  beer and ale, strong and small; those of most note, that"]]]
