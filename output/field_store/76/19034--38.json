His countenance evinced a  settled composure and dignity; his nose was straight, and approaching to  Grecian; his eye, of a gray color, was quiet, thoughtful, and rather  melancholy; the mouth and lower part of his face being expressive of  decision and much character. His dress, being suited to the road, was  simple and plain, but such as was worn by the higher class of his  countrymen; he wore his own hair, dressed in a manner that gave a  military air to his appearance, and which was rather heightened by his  erect and conspicuously graceful carriage. His whole appearance was so  impressive and so decidedly that of a gentleman, that as he finished  laying aside the garments, the ladies arose from their seats, and,  together with the master of the house, they received anew, and returned  the complimentary greetings which were again offered.    The host was by several years the senior of the traveler, and by his  manner, dress, and everything around him, showed he had seen much of  life and the best society. The ladies were, a maiden of forty, and two  much younger, who did not seem, indeed, to have reached half those  years. The bloom of the elder of these ladies had vanished, but her eyes  and fine hair gave an extremely agreeable expression to her countenance;  and there was a softness and an affability in her deportment, that added  a charm many more juvenile faces do not possess. The sisters, for such  the resemblance between the younger females denoted them to be, were in  all the pride of youth, and the roses, so eminently the property of the  Westchester fair, glowed on their cheeks, and lighted their deep blue  eyes with that luster which gives so much pleasure to the beholder, and  which indicates so much internal innocence and peace. There was much of  that feminine delicacy in the appearance of the three, which  distinguishes the sex in this country; and, like the gentleman, their  demeanor proved them to be women of the higher order of life.    After handing a glass of excellent Madeira to his guest, Mr. Wharton,  for so was the owner of this retired estate called, resumed his seat by  the fire, with another in his own hand. For a moment he paused, as if  debating with his politeness, but at length threw an inquiring glance on  the stranger, as he inquired,--    \"To whose health am I to have the honor of drinking?\"    The traveler had also seated himself, and he sat unconsciously gazing on  the fire, while Mr. Wharton spoke; turning his eyes slowly on his host  with a look of close observation, he replied, while a faint tinge  gathered on his features,--    \"Mr. Harper.\"    \"Mr. Harper,\" resumed the other, with the formal precision of that day,  \"I have the honor to drink your health, and to hope you will sustain no  injury from the rain to which you have been exposed.\"    Mr. Harper bowed in silence to the compliment, and he soon resumed the  meditations from which he had been interrupted, and for which the long  ride he had that day made, in the wind, might seem a very  natural apology.    The young ladies had again taken their seats beside the workstand, while  their aunt, Miss Jeanette Peyton, withdrew to superintend the  preparations necessary to appease the hunger of their unexpected  visitor. A short silence prevailed, during which Mr. Harper was  apparently enjoying the change in his situation, when Mr. Wharton again  broke it, by inquiring whether smoke was disagreeable to his companion;  to which, receiving an answer in the negative, he immediately resumed  the pipe which had been laid aside at the entrance of the traveler.    There was an evident desire on the part of the host to enter into  conversation, but either from an apprehension of treading on dangerous  ground, or an unwillingness to intrude upon the rather studied  taciturnity of his guest, he several times hesitated, before he could  venture to make any further remark. At length, a movement from Mr.  Harper, as he raised his eyes to the party in the room, encouraged him  to proceed.    \"I find it very difficult,\" said Mr. Wharton, cautiously avoiding at  first, such subjects as he wished to introduce, \"to procure that quality  of tobacco for my evenings' amusement to which I have been accustomed.\"    \"I should think the shops in New York might furnish the best in the  country,\" calmly rejoined the other.    \"Why--yes,\" returned the host in rather a hesitating manner, lifting his  eyes to the face of Harper, and lowering them quickly under his steady  look, \"there must be plenty in town; but the war has made communication  with the city, however innocent, too dangerous to be risked for so  trifling an article as tobacco.\"    The box from which Mr. Wharton had just taken a supply for his pipe was  lying open, within a few inches of the elbow of Harper, who took a small  quantity from its contents, and applied it to his tongue, in a manner  perfectly natural, but one that filled his companion with alarm.  Without, however, observing that the quality was of the most approved  kind, the traveler relieved his host by relapsing again into his  meditations. Mr. Wharton now felt unwilling to lose the advantage he had  gained, and, making an effort of more than usual vigor, he continued,--    \"I wish from the bottom of my heart, this unnatural struggle was over,  that we might again meet our friends and relatives in peace and love.\"    \"It is much to be desired,\" said Harper, emphatically, again raising his  eyes to the countenance of his host.    \"I hear of no movement of consequence, since the arrival of our new  allies,\" said Mr. Wharton, shaking the ashes from his pipe, and turning  his back to the other under the pretense of receiving a coal from his  youngest daughter.    \"None have yet reached the public, I believe.\"    \"Is it thought any important steps are about to be taken?\" continued Mr.  Wharton, still occupied with his daughter, yet suspending his  employment, in expectation of a reply.    \"Is it intimated any are in agitation?\"    \"Oh! nothing in particular; but it is natural to expect some new  enterprise from so powerful a force as that under Rochambeau.\"    Harper made an assenting inclination with his head, but no other reply,  to this remark; while Mr. Wharton, after lighting his pipe, resumed  the subject.    \"They appear more active in the south; Gates and Cornwallis seem willing  to bring the war to an issue there.\"    The brow of Harper contracted, and a deeper shade of melancholy crossed  his features; his eye kindled with a transient beam of fire, that spoke  a latent source of deep feeling. The admiring gaze of the younger of the  sisters had barely time to read its expression, before it passed away,  leaving in its room the acquired composure which marked the countenance  of the stranger, and that impressive dignity which so conspicuously  denotes the empire of reason.    The elder sister made one or two movements in her chair, before she  ventured to say, in a tone which partook in no small measure of  triumph,--    \"General Gates has been less fortunate with the earl, than with General  Burgoyne.\"    \"But General Gates is an Englishman, Sarah,\" cried the younger lady,  with quickness; then, coloring to the eyes at her own boldness, she  employed herself in tumbling over the contents of her work basket,  silently hoping the remark would be unnoticed.    The traveler had turned his face from one sister to the other, as they  had spoken in succession, and an almost imperceptible movement of the  muscles of his mouth betrayed a new emotion, as he playfully inquired of  the younger,--    \"May I venture to ask what inference you would draw from that fact?\"    Frances blushed yet deeper at this direct appeal to her opinions upon a  subject on which she had incautiously spoken in the presence of a  stranger; but finding an answer necessary, after some little hesitation,  and with a good deal of stammering in her manner, she replied,--    \"Only--only--sir--my sister and myself sometimes differ in our opinions  of the prowess of the British.\" A smile of much meaning played on a  face of infantile innocency, as she concluded.    \"On what particular points of their prowess do you differ?\" continued  Harper, meeting her look of animation with a smile of almost  paternal softness.    \"Sarah thinks the British are never beaten, while I do not put so much  faith in their invincibility.\"    The traveler listened to her with that pleased indulgence, with which  virtuous age loves to contemplate the ardor of youthful innocence; but  making no reply, he turned to the fire, and continued for some time  gazing on its embers, in silence.    Mr. Wharton had in vain endeavored to pierce the disguise of his guest's  political feelings; but, while there was nothing forbidding in his  countenance, there was nothing communicative; on the contrary it was  strikingly reserved; and the master of the house arose, in profound  ignorance of what, in those days, was the most material point in the  character of his guest, to lead the way into another room, and to the  supper table. Mr. Harper offered his hand to Sarah Wharton, and they  entered the room together; while Frances followed, greatly at a loss to  know whether she had not wounded the feelings of her father's inmate.    The storm began to rage with great violence without; and the dashing  rain on the sides of the building awakened that silent sense of  enjoyment, which is excited by such sounds in a room of quiet comfort  and warmth, when a loud summons at the outer door again called the  faithful black to the portal. In a minute the servant returned, and  informed his master that another traveler, overtaken by the storm,  desired to be admitted to the house for a shelter through the night.    At the first sounds of the impatient summons of this new"]]]
