They were all  cut from the same strip of metal, but some were \"cold-rolled,\" some  \"annealed,\" and some \"hardened.\" The total carbon was found to be:  \"cold-rolled,\" 1.108 per cent.; hardened, 1.128 per cent.; and annealed,  0.924 and 0.860 per cent. Some of the disks were submitted to the action  of an oxidizing solution consisting of a cold saturated solution of  potassium bichromate with 5 per cent. by volume of pure concentrated  sulphuric acid. In all cases a blackish magnetic residue was left  undissolved. These residues, calculated upon 100 parts of the disks  employed, had the following compositions: \"Cold-rolled\" carbon, 1.039  per cent.; iron, 5.871. Annealed, C, 0.83 per cent.; Fe, 4.74 per cent.  Hardened, C, 0.178 per cent.; Fe, 0.70 per cent. So that by treatment  with chromic acid in the cold nearly the whole of the carbon remains  undissolved with the cold-rolled and annealed disks, but only about  one-sixth of the total carbon is left undissolved in the case of the  hardened disk. The authors then give a _resume_ of previous work on the  subject. In the second part they have investigated the action of  bichromate solutions of various strengths on thin sheet-steel, about  0.098 inch thick, which was cold-rolled and contained: Carbon, 1.144 per  cent.; silica, 0.166 per cent.; manganese, 0.104 per cent. Four  solutions were used. The first contained about 10 per cent. of  bichromate and 9 per cent. of H_{2}SO_{4} by weight; the second was  eight-tenths as strong, the third about half as strong, the fourth about  one and a half times as strong. In all cases the amount of solution  employed was considerably in excess of the amount required to dissolve  the steel used. A residue was obtained as before. With solution 1, the  residue contained, C, 1.021; sol. 2, C, 0.969; sol. 3, C 1.049 the  atomic ratio of iron to carbon was Fe 2.694: C, 1; Fe, 2.65: C, 1; Fe),  2.867 C, 1): sol. 4. C, 0.266 per 100 of steel. The authors conclude  that the carbon in cold rolled steel exists not simply diffused  mechanically through the mass of steel but in the form of an iron  carbide, Fe_{3}C, a definite product, capable of resisting the action of  an oxidizing solution (if the latter is not too strong), which exerts a  rapid solvent action upon the iron through which the carbide is  distributed.           *       *       *       *       *          APPARATUS FOR EXTRACTING STARCH FROM POTATOES.      In the apparatus of Mr. Angele, of Berlin, shown in the annexed cuts  (Figs. 1 and 2), the potatoes, after being cleaned in the washer, C,  slide through the chute, v, into a rasp, D, which reduces them to a fine  pulp under the action of a continuous current of water led in by the  pipe, d. The liquid pulp flows into the iron reservoir, B, from whence a  pump, P, forces it through the pipe, w, to a sieve, g, which is  suspended by four bars and has a backward and forward motion. By means  of a rose, c, water is sprinkled over the entire surface of the sieve  and separates the fecula from the fibrous matter. The water, charged  with fine particles of fecula, and forming a sort of milk, flows through  the tube, z, into the lower part, N, of the washing apparatus, F, while  the pulp runs over the sieve and falls into the grinding-mill, H. This  latter divides all those cellular portions of the fecula that have not  been opened by the rasp, and allows them to run, through the tube, h,  into the washing apparatus, F, where the fecula is completely separated  from woody fibers. The fluid pulp is carried by means of a helix, i, to  a revolving perforated drum at e. From this, the milky starch flows into  the jacket, N, while the pulp (ligneous fibers) makes its exit from the  apparatus through the aperture, n, and falls into the reservoir, o.    [Illustration: ANGELE'S POTATO-STARCH APPARATUS.]    The liquid from the jacket, N, passes to a refining sieve, K, which,  like the one before mentioned, has a backward and forward motion, and  which is covered with very fine silk gauze in order to separate the very  finest impurities from the milky starch. The refined liquid then flows  into the reservoir, m, and the impure mass of sediment runs into the  pulp-reservoir, o. The pump, l, forces the milky liquid from the  reservoir, m, to the settling back, while the pulp is forced by a pump,  u, from the receptacle, o, into a large pulp-reservoir.    The water necessary for the manufacture is forced by the pump, a, into  the reservoir, W, from whence it flows, through the pipes, r, into the  different machines. All the apparatus are set in motion by two  shaftings, q. The principal shaft makes two hundred revolutions per  minute, but the velocity of that of the pumps is but fifty  revolutions.--_Polytech. Journ., and Bull. Musee de l'Indust_.           *       *       *       *       *          A SIMPLE APPARATUS FOR DESCRIBING ELLIPSES.    By Prof. E.J. HALLOCK.      A very simple apparatus for describing an oval or ellipse may be  constructed by any apprentice or school boy as follows: Procure a  straight piece of wood about 1/4 inch wide by 1/8 inch thick and 13 inches  long. Beginning 1/2 inch from the end, bore a row of small holes only  large enough for a darning needle to pass through and half an inch  apart. Mark the first one (at A) 0, the third 1, the fifth 2, and so on  to 12, so that the numbers represent the distance from O in inches. A  small slit may be made in the end of the ruler or strip of wood near A,  but a better plan is to attach a small clip on one side.    [Illustration: ELLIPSE INSTRUMENT.]    Next procure a strong piece of linen thread about four feet long; pass  it through the eye of a coarse needle, wax and twist it until it forms a  single cord. Pass the needle _upward_ through the hole marked 0, and tie  a knot in the end of the thread to prevent its slipping through. The  apparatus is now ready for immediate use. It only remains to set it to  the size of the oval desired.    Suppose it is required to describe an ellipse the longer diameter of  which is 8 inches, and the distance between the foci 5 inches. Insert a  pin or small tack loosely in the hole between 6 and 7, which is distant  6-1/2 inches from O. Pass the needle through hole 5, allowing the thread  to pass around the tack or pin; draw it tightly and fasten it in the  slit or clip at the end. Lay the apparatus on a smooth sheet of paper,  place the point of a pencil at E, and keeping the string tight pass it  around and describe the curve, just in the same manner as when the two  ends of the string are fastened to the paper at the foci. The chief  advantage claimed over the usual method is that it may be applied to  metal and stone, where it is difficult to attach a string. On drawings  it avoids the necessity of perforating the paper with pins.    As the pencil point is liable to slip out of the loop formed by the  string, it should have a nick cut or filed in one side, like a crochet  needle.    As the mechanic frequently wants to make an oval having a given width  and length, but does not know what the distance between the foci must be  to produce this effect, a few directions on this point may be useful:    It is a fact well known to mathematicians that if the distance between  the foci and the shorter diameter of an ellipse be made the sides of a  right angled triangle, its hypothenuse will equal the greater diameter.  Hence in order to find the distance between the foci, when the length  and width of the ellipse are known, these two are squared and the lesser  square subtracted from the greater, when the square root of the  difference will be the quantity sought. For example, if it be required  to describe an ellipse that shall have a length of 5 inches and a width  of 3 inches, the distance between the foci will be found as follows:      (5 x 5) - (3 x 3) = (4 x 4)    or                   __       25 - 9 = 16 and \\/16 = 4.    In the shop this distance may be found experimentally by laying a foot  rule on a square so that one end of the former will touch the figure  marking the lesser diameter on the latter, and then bringing the figure  on the rule that represents the greater diameter to the edge of the  square; the figure on the square at this point is the distance sought.  Unfortunately they rarely represent whole numbers. We present herewith a  table giving the width to the eighth of an inch for several different  ovals when the length and distance between foci are given.          Length.     Distance between foci.

Under the head of investment of capital will be considered stock of  every description, all implements of husbandry, and other articles  which may be applicable to the purposes of productive industry, or  which may be necessary for the establishment of the settler on the  land where he is to be located. The amount of any half-pay or pension  which the applicant may receive from Government, will also be  considered as so much capital.    4. Those who may incur the expense of taking out labouring persons,  will be entitled to an allowance of land at the rate of fifteen  pounds, that is, of two hundred acres of land, for the passage of  every such labouring person, over and above any other investment  of capital. In the class of \"labouring persons,\" are included  women, and children above ten years old. Provision will be made by  law, at the earliest opportunity for rendering those capitalists, who  may be engaged in taking out labouring persons to this settlement,  liable for the future maintenance of those persons, should they, from  infirmity, of any other cause, become unable to maintain themselves  there.    5. The license of occupation of land will be granted to the settler,  on satisfactory proof being exhibited to the Lieutenant Governor (or  other officer administering the Local Government,) of the amount of  property brought into the colony. The proofs required of such property  will be such satisfactory vouchers of expenses as would be received in  auditing public accounts. But the full title to the land will not be  granted in fee simple, until the settler has proved, (to the  satisfaction of the Lieutenant Governor for other officer  administering the Local Government,) that the sum required by Article  2 of these regulations (viz. one shilling and sixpence per acre) has  been expended in the cultivation of the land, or in solid  improvements, such as buildings, roads, or other works of the kind.    6. Any grant of land thus allotted, of which a fair proportion, of at  least one fourth, shall not have been brought into cultivation,  otherwise improved or reclaimed from its wild state, to the extent of  one shilling and sixpence per acre, to the satisfaction of the Local  Government, within three years from the date of the license of  occupation, shall, at the end of three years, be liable to a payment  of sixpence per acre, into the public chest of the settlement; and, at  the expiration of seven years more, should the land still remain in an  uncultivated or unimproved state, it will revert absolutely to the  crown.    7. After the year 1830, land will be disposed of to those settlers who  may resort to the colony, on such conditions as his Majesty's  Government shall see occasion to adopt.    8. It is not intended that any convicts, or other description of  prisoners, be transported to this new settlement.    9. The government will be administered by Captain Stirling, of the  Royal Navy, as Lieut. Governor of the settlement; and it is proposed  that a bill should be submitted to parliament, in the course of the  next session, to make provision for the civil government of the New  Settlement.    _Downing Street, 13th January, 1829_.    The intended settlement is designated, in the \"Regulations,\" as the  \"New Colony on the Swan River;\"[3] but this is a name, we think, not  sufficiently comprehensive for the extent of territory meant to be  occupied. What its future designation is meant to be, we pretend not  to know, but if its soil should prove as fruitful as its climate is  fine, the position and aspect of this part of the coast might justify  the name of Southern, or Australian, _Hesperia_; under which might be  included all that line of coast from Cape Leuwin, the southernmost  point of New Holland, in lat. 34 deg. 30 min., long. 115 deg. 12 min.  east, to the lat. 31 deg. (or a degree or two more northerly) long.  115 deg. 15 min. east; and from the former point easterly to King  George's Sound, where an English colony has already been established.  This extent of territory, between the sea-coast and a range of  mountains parallel to it, hereafter to be described, may be estimated  to contain from five to six millions of acres, the greater part of  which, from the general appearance of the two extreme portions (the  only ones examined) may be considered as land fit for the plough, and,  therefore, fully capable of giving support to a million of souls. The  description we are about to give of this territory is mainly derived  from Captain Stirling, the intelligent officer who explored the  country, and of which he has been appointed the Lieutenant Governor,  and from Mr. Fraser, an excellent botanist, who accompanied him, and  who was well acquainted with the soil and products of New South Wales,  on the opposite side of Australia.    Captain Stirling, when commanding the Success frigate, was sent to New  South Wales on a particular service, which the state of the monsoon  prevented him from carrying into immediate execution. He determined,  therefore, on the recommendation of General Darling, the governor, to  explore, in the meantime, this western part of Australia, which was  omitted to be surveyed by Captain King, on the ground that it had been  _visited_ by the French in the expedition of Captain Baudin: the  result of that visit, however, is so unsatisfactory, and so very  inaccurate, that we are rather surprised that Captain King should have  passed over so interesting a portion, geographically considered, as  the south-western angle of this great country. Captain Stirling  arrived at Cape Leuwin on the 2nd of March, 1827, stood along the  coast, and anchored in Gage's Roads, opposite Swan River, which he  afterwards ascended to its source in boats, and sent out exploring  parties to ascertain the nature of the surrounding territory.    \"We found,\" he says, \"the country in general rich and romantic, gained  the summit of the first range of mountains, and had a bird's-eye view  of an immense plain, which extended as far as the eye could reach to  the northward, southward, and westward. After ten days' absence, we  returned to the ship; we encountered no difficulty that was not easily  removable; we were furnished with abundance of fresh provisions by our  guns, and met with no obstruction from the natives.\"    Captain Stirling describes the weather as very different from that  which the French experienced; but the latter were on the coast at the  commencement of the winter season. They were apparently so alarmed at  the gales of wind, the rocks, and the reefs, and the banks, that they  hastened to leave behind them this part of the coast unexamined, with  all convenient speed. The strong westerly winds that prevail  throughout the year in the southern ocean to the southward of the  tropic, appear to assume a northern direction near this part of the  Coast of Australia. These winds are here found to be cool and  pleasant, and were generally accompanied by clear and serene weather.  The summer winds from the N.W. are not infrequent; and, coming charged  with moisture from a warm region into a colder one, they are  invariably accompanied by rain; but, in the immediate vicinity of the  shore, land and sea breezes are constant and regular. The climate  appears to be delightful. While the Success was on the coast--that is,  in the autumn--the average height of the thermometer was 72 deg., the  extremes being 84 deg. and 59 deg., the first occurring before the  sea-breeze set in, the latter at midnight. The French found the  temperature when at anchor, in June, from 14 deg. to 17 deg. of  Reaumur, or 63 deg. to 70 deg. of Fahrenheit. On the mountains,  Captain Stirling says, the temperature appeared to be about 15 deg.  below that of the plain. The alternate land and sea breezes create a  moisture in the atmosphere which renders the climate cool and  agreeable; the mornings and evenings are particularly so; and the  nights are almost invariably brilliant and clear. Such a climate, it  is almost unnecessary to say must be highly favourable to vegetation,  which was accordingly observed to be most luxuriant. \"The verdant  appearance,\" says Captain Stirling, \"and almost innumerable variety of  grasses, herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees, show that there is no  deficiency in the three great sources of their sustenance, soil, heat,  and moisture.\"    The general structure and aspect of the country may be thus  described:--from Cape Leuwin to Cape Naturaliste (the southern head of  Baie Geographe,) which is not quite a degree of latitude, the coast is  formed of a range of hills, of uniform and moderate elevation. From  Geographer's Bay to the northward of Swan River, the whole coast line  is a limestone ridge, varying in height from twenty to six hundred  feet, and extending inward to the distance of from one to five miles.  Behind this ridge (whose occasional naked and barren appearance  Captain Stirling also thinks may have caused the early and continued  prejudice against the fertility of this western coast) commences a  great plain, which occupies a space, from south to north, of  undetermined length, (reaching, perhaps, to King George's Sound,) and  varying, in breadth, from twenty to fifty miles. The eastern boundary  of this plain skirts the base of an almost continuous and abrupt chain  of mountains, to which Captain Stirling gave the name of \"General  Darling's Range.\" One"]]]
