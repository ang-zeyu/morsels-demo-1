No matter what one may think of the so-called criminal  and his responsibility, or quite regardless of whether we feel pity or  hatred, the great mass of the community will not suffer one who has  little self-control to interfere seriously and directly with the peace  and happiness of the community in which he lives. Whether by the action  of the law or by vigilance committees, some men will not be allowed to  be at large. Doubtless under proper treatment and environment most of  this sort of anti-social conduct would disappear, but for many years to  come it will remain.    Taking away the liberty of another has only one justification. The great  mass of people in any community must and will act for self-defense. It  needs no fine-spun theories to justify it. Hatred should have nothing to  do with it. The conduct of man in this regard is only like that of the  animal which destroys the one that is inimical to the pack or herd. The  self-protection of the group is the same as the self-protection of the  individual. Both the group and the man will save their lives against a  lunatic or any other menace, regardless of the nature of the menace.    Punishment, in the proper meaning of the term, cannot be justified by  any reasoning. Punishment really means the infliction of pain because  the individual has wilfully transgressed. Its supposed justification is  that somehow the evil done is atoned for, or made good, or balanced if  the author of the evil shall suffer pain. Punishment means that the  suffering by the victim is the end, and it does not mean that any good  will grow out of the suffering. It seems as if the question only needed  to be stated for right-thinking men to deny the validity of punishment.    It may be argued that whether the victim is punished or simply  restrained can make no difference. In this lies the whole difference  between scientific and humane treatment of the unfortunate, and the  vengeful punishments that have always been visited by the strong upon  the helpless and the weak. Society restrains the imbecile, the  dangerously insane, the victims of deadly, contagious diseases. All  these are restrained without any feeling of hatred, but with pity and  understanding. Society does not keep one of these persons under  restraint after he has sufficiently recovered to make it safe to return  him to the community; neither does it release one until he is safe. It  uses the best methods for his treatment that may make him fit to live  with his fellows, and the best efforts to place him in a proper  environment when discharged. Neither does any disgrace nor humiliation  nor handicap attach to the unfortunate when discharged. In a sense, the  attitude of mind held by the group toward the \"criminal\" is the whole  question. From this everything follows, and without it change or  humanity or hope is not possible.    It is true that insane asylums, homes for the feeble-minded, and  hospitals are not what they should be, nor what they will be some day.  All of this is not due to the attitude of the mind of the public, but is  due to the method of administration which is not within the scope of  this book. If justice and humanity shall ever have to do with the  treatment of the criminal, and if science shall ever be called upon in  this, one of the most serious and painful questions of the ages, it is  necessary, first, that the public shall have a better understanding of  crime and criminals.          III    RESPONSIBILITY FOR CRIME      It is only lately that we are beginning to find out anything about the  origin and nature of man. Laws have come down to us from old customs and  folk-ways based on primitive ideas of man's origin, capacity and  responsibility. It has been generally assumed that man was created  different from all the rest of animal life; that man alone was endowed  with a soul and with the power to tell good from evil; that in the  beginning man was perfect but yielded to temptation, and since then has  been the subject of an everlasting contest between the powers of light  and the powers of darkness for the possession of his soul; that man not  only knew good from evil, but was endowed with \"free will,\" and had the  power to choose between good and evil; and that when he did wrong he  deliberately chose to do so out of an abandoned and malignant heart; and  that all men alike were endowed with this power and all alike were  responsible for their acts.    The old indictments charged that: \"John Smith, being a wicked, malicious  and evil disposed person, not having the fear of God before his eyes,  but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil etc.\" It  followed, of course, that John Smith should be punished or made to  suffer, for he had purposely brought all the evil on himself. The old  idea is still the foundation of the world's judgment of men, in court  and out. Of course this idea leaves no room for mercy and understanding.  Neither does it leave any chance to give the criminal the proper  treatment for his defects which might permit him to lead a normal life.    As a matter of fact, every scientific man knows that the origin of life  is quite different from this; that the whole current conception of the  individual and his responsibility is a gross error; and that no correct  judgments can be based on the old foundation; that no sane treatment of  crime can follow this assumption of man's origin and nature; that the  result of this foundation is almost infinite injustice and cruelty to a  large and constantly growing number of men and women; and that it tends  to endless injury and evil to society. The conception of man and the  treatment of crime and criminals by the courts is not better nor more  scientific than was the old-time doctors' treatment of physical ailments  by magic, incantations and sorcery.    The origin and development of all animal life is the same. In fact, the  development of plant life is on a similar pattern. The origin of a  human being is a simple cell, an egg. This cell is fertilized and  through growth after fertilization begins dividing and building and  taking on the form and semblance of a human being. All children have the  same origin, the same development and the same pattern, yet no two are  alike. Each has a distinct and different equipment from any of the  others. The size of the body, real and potential; the size and fineness  of the brain; the delicacy and sensitiveness of the nervous system; the  innate instincts upon which conduct mainly rests; the emotions which  control action and which flow from the structure--in short, the degree  of perfection and imperfection of the machine is all hidden in the  original cell. No well-informed person now thinks of questioning the  fact that the main characteristics of the human being, as of every other  animal and plant, are hidden in the germ or seed from which it sprang.    The laws of growth and development which govern organic matter were not  made for man and do not except man. Life begins with the cell and  evolves according to pattern. If the cell is that of a human being, it  will be black or white, male or female, tall or short, intelligent or  stupid, sensitive or stolid; it will develop a large or a small brain, a  fine one or a poor one, a sensitive nervous system or a defective one;  it will be ruled by instincts that are all-powerful and controlling,  and even the color of the hair and eyes are in the pattern. The whole  structure, potentially, is in the original cell, and infinite knowledge  could tell how the structure would respond to sensations as it passed  through life.    It is obvious that the kinds and differences of human structures are  infinite. It is no more possible for all men to respond equally to the  same stimulus, than it is for all machines or all animals to respond  alike. It is apparent that not one of the structures can ever work  perfectly, and that from the best down to the poorest structures are  infinite degrees of perfection, even down to the machine that has no  capacity for any kind of work.    No ordinarily intelligent farmer doubts for a moment that all of this is  true in the breeding of stock. He would never expect the same results  from various breeds of cattle or even from all cattle of the same breed.    There is no exception to the rule that the whole life, with every  tendency, is potential in the original cell. An acorn will invariably  produce an oak tree. It can produce no other tree, and it will always  develop true to its own pattern. The tree may be larger or smaller, more  or less symmetrical, stronger or weaker, but always true to the general  pattern of the oak. Variations will be certain, due in part to heredity  and in part to environment.    That the baby had nothing to do with its equipment will readily be  admitted by everyone. The child is born with a brain of a certain size  and fineness. It is born with a nervous system made up of an infinite  number of fine fibers reaching all parts of the body, with fixed  stations or receivers like the central stations of a telephone system,  and with a grand central exchange in the brain. If one can imagine all  of the telephone wires in the world centered in one station, he may have  some sort of a conception of the separate nerves that bring impressions  to the brain and send directions out from it, which together make up the  nervous system of man. None of these systems is perfect. They are of all  degrees of imperfection down to the utterly useless or worse than  useless system. These nerves are of all degrees of sensitiveness and  accuracy in receiving and transmitting messages. Some may work well,  others imperfectly. No one is much surprised when an automobile,  equipped with a mechanism much simpler than the nervous system, refuses  to respond properly.    The child is born without knowledge but with certain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12058"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#5)"],[1,"him in words that were not unsuited to his object,  saying, 'O foremost of kings, I am a cook, Vallava by name. I am skilled  in dressing dishes. Do thou employ me in the kitchen!'    \"Virata said, 'I do not believe, O Vallava, that cooking is thy office.  Thou resemblest the deity of a thousand eyes; and in grace and beauty  and prowess, thou shinest among these all as a king!'    \"Bhima replied, 'O king of kings, I am thy cook and servant in the first  place. It is not curries only of which I have knowledge, O monarch,  although king Yudhishthira always used in days gone by to taste my  dishes. O lord of earth, I am also a wrestler. Nor is there one that is  equal to me in strength. And engaging in fight with lions and elephants,  I shall, O sinless one, always contribute to thy entertainment.'    \"Virata said, 'I will even grant thee boons. Thou wilt do what thou  wishest, as thou describest thyself skilled in it. I do not, however,  think, that this office is worthy of thee, for thou deservest this  (entire) earth girt round by the sea. But do as thou likest. Be thou the  superintendent of my kitchen, and thou art placed at the head of those  who have been appointed there before by me.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus appointed in the kitchen, Bhima soon  became the favourite of king Virata. And, O king, he continued to live  there unrecognised by the other servants of Virata as also by other  people!\"      SECTION IX    Vaisampayana said, \"Binding her black, soft, fine, long and faultless  tresses with crisped ends into a knotted braid, Draupadi of black eyes  and sweet smiles, throwing it upon her right shoulders, concealed it by  her cloth. And she wore a single piece of a black and dirty though  costly cloth. And dressing herself as a _Sairindhri_, she began to  wander hither and thither in seeming affliction. And beholding her  wandering, men and women came to her hastily and addressed her, saying,  'Who are you? And what do you seek?' And she replied, 'I am a king's  _Sairindhri_. I desire to serve any one that will maintain me.' But  beholding her beauty and dress, and hearing also her speech that was so  sweet, the people could not take her for a maid-servant in search of  subsistence. And it came to pass that while looking this way and that  from the terrace, Virata's beloved queen, daughter of the king of  Kekaya, saw Draupadi. And beholding her forlorn and clad in a single  piece of cloth, the queen addressed her saying, 'O beautiful one, who  are you, and what do you seek?' Thereupon, Draupadi answered her,  saying, 'O foremost of queens, I am _Sairindhri_. I will serve anybody  that will maintain me.' Then Sudeshna said, 'What you say (regarding  your profession) can never be compatible with so much beauty. (On the  contrary) you might well be the mistress of servants both, male and  female. Your heels are not prominent, and your thighs touch each other.  And your intelligence is great, and your navel deep, and your words  solemn. And your great toes, and bust and hips, and back and sides, and  toe-nails, and palms are all well-developed. And your palms, soles, and  face are ruddy. And your speech is sweet even as the voice of the swan.  And your hair is beautiful, and your bust shapely, and you are possessed  of the highest grace. And your hips and bust are plump. And like a  Kashmerean mare you are furnished with every auspicious mark. And your  eye-lashes are (beautiful) bent, and your nether-lip is like the ruddy  ground. And your waist is slender, and your neck bears lines that  resemble those of the conch. And your veins are scarcely visible.  Indeed, your countenance is like the full moon, and your eyes resemble  the leaves of the autumnal lotus, and your body is fragrant as the lotus  itself. Verily, in beauty you resemble _Sri_ herself, whose seat is the  autumnal lotus. Tell me, O beautiful damsel, who thou art. Thou canst  never be a maidservant. Art thou a _Yakshi_, a Goddess, a _Gandharvi_,  or an _Apsara_? Art thou the daughter of a celestial, or art thou a  female _Naga_? Art thou the guardian goddess of some city, a  _Vidyadhari_, or a _Kinnari_,--or art thou _Rohini_ herself? Or art thou  Alamvusha, or Misrakesi, Pundarika, or Malini, or the queen of Indra, or  of Varuna? Or, art thou the spouse of Viswakarma, or of the creative  Lord himself? Of these goddesses who art renowned in the celestial  regions, who art thou, O graceful one?'    \"Draupadi replied, 'O auspicious lady, I am neither a goddess nor a  _Gandharvi_, nor a _Yakshi_, nor a _Rakshasi_. I am a maid-servant of  the _Sairindhri_ class. I tell thee this truly. I know to dress the  hair, to pound (fragrant substances) for preparing unguents, and also to  make beautiful and variegated garlands, O beauteous lady, of jasmines  and lotuses and blue lilies and _Champakas_. Formerly I served Krishna's  favourite queen Satyabhama, and also Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas  and the foremost beauty of the Kuru race. I wander about alone, earning  good food and dress; and as long as I get these, I continue to live in  the place where they are obtainable. Draupadi herself called me Malini  (maker of garlands).'    \"Hearing this, Sudeshna said, 'I would keep thee upon my head itself, if  the doubt did not cross my mind that the king himself would be attracted  towards thee with his whole heart. Attracted by thy beauty, the females  of the royal household and my maids are looking at thee. What male  person then is there that can resist thy attraction? Surely, O thou of  well-rounded hips, O damsel of exquisite charms, beholding thy form of  superhuman beauty, king Virata is sure to forsake me, and will turn to  thee with his whole heart. O thou of faultless limbs, O thou that art  endued with large eyes casting quick glances, he upon whom thou wilt  look with desire is sure to be stricken. O thou of sweet smiles, O thou  that possessest a faultless form, he that will behold thee constantly,  will surely catch the flame. Even as a person that climbs up a tree for  compassing his own destruction, even as the crab conceives for her own  ruin, I may, O thou of sweet smiles, bring destruction upon myself by  harbouring thee.'    \"Draupadi replied, 'O fair lady, neither Virata nor any other person  will be able to have me, for my five youthful husbands, who are  _Gandharvas_ and sons of a _Gandharva_ king of exceeding power, always  protect me. None can do me a wrong. It is the wish of my _Gandharva_  husbands that I should serve only such persons as will not give me to  touch food already partaken of by another, or tell me to wash their  feet. Any man that attempts to have me like any common woman, meeteth  with death that very night. No one can succeed in having me, for, O  beautiful lady, O thou of sweet smiles, those beloved _Gandharvas_,  possessed of great energy and mighty strength always protect me  secretly.'    \"Sudeshna said, 'O thou that bringest delight to the heart, if it is as  thou sayest, I will take thee into my household. Thou shalt not have to  touch food that hath been partaken of by another, or to wash another's  feet.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by Virata's wife, O Janamejaya,  Krishna (Draupadi) ever devoted to her lords, began to live in that  city. Nor could anyone ascertain who in reality she was!\"      SECTION X    \"Vaisampayana said, 'Then clad in a cowherd's dress, and speaking the  dialect of cowherds, Sahadeva came to the cowpen of Virata's city. And  beholding that bull among men, who was shining in splendour, the king  was struck with amazement. And he directed his men to summon Sahadeva.  And when the latter came, the king addressed him, saying, 'To whom dost  thou belong? And whence dost thou come? And what work dost thou seek? I  have never seen thee before. O bull among men, tell me truly about  thee.'    \"Having come before the king that afflicter of foes, Sahadeva answered  in accents deep as the roar of the cloud, 'I am a Vaisya, Arishtanemi by  name. I was employed as a cowherd in the service of those bulls of the  Kuru race, the sons of Pandu. O foremost of men, I intend now to live  beside thee, for I do not know where those lions among kings, the sons  of Pritha, are. I cannot live without service, and, O king, I do not  like to enter into the service of anyone else save thee.'    \"Hearing these words, Virata said, 'Thou must either be a Brahmana or a  Kshatriya. Thou lookest as if thou wert the lord of the entire earth  surrounded by the sea. Tell me truly, O thou that mowest down thy foes.  The office of a Vaisya is not fit for thee. Tell me from the dominions  of what king thou comest, and what thou knowest, and in what capacity  thou wouldst remain with us, and also what pay thou wouldst accept.'    \"Sahadeva answered, 'Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five sons of Pandu,  had one division of kine numbering eight hundred and ten thousand, and  another, ten thousand, and another, again, twenty thousand, and so on. I  was employed in keeping those cattle. People used to call me Tantripala.  I know the present, the past, and the future of all kine living within  ten _Yojanas_, and whose _tale_ has been taken. My merits were known to  that illustrious one, and the Kuru king Yudhishthira was well-pleased  with me. I am also acquainted with the means which aid kine in  multiplying within a short time, and by which they may enjoy immunity  from disease. Also these arts are known to me. I can also single out  bulls having auspicious marks for which they are worshipped by men, and  by smelling whose urine, the barren may conceive.'    \"Virata said, 'I have a hundred thousand kine divided into distinct  herds. All those together with their keepers, I place in thy charge.  Henceforth my beasts will be in thy keep.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Then, O king, undiscovered by that monarch,  that lord of men, Sahadeva, maintained by Virata, began to live happily.  Nor"]]]
