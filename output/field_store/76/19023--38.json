It may be that  your brother has met with a vein of that in the tunnel,\" Tom said to  the contractor.    \"Possibly,\" admitted Mr. Titus.    \"In that case,\" Tom stated, \"I may have to use a new kind of explosive.  That used for my giant cannon would merely crumble the hard rock for a  short distance.\"    \"Then will you accept the contract, and help us out?\" asked Mr. Titus  eagerly. \"We will pay you well. Will you come to Peru and look over the  ground?\"    \"And kill two birds with one stone, and come with me also?\" put in Mr.  Damon.    Tom pondered for a moment. He was about to answer when the tunnel  contractor, who was looking from the library window, suddenly jumped  from his chair crying:    \"There he is again! Once more dogging me!\"    As he rushed from the room, Tom and Mr. Damon had a glimpse of a face  at one of the low library windows--a face that had an evil look. It  disappeared as Mr. Titus ran from the room.          Chapter IV    Tom's Experiments      \"Bless my looking glass, Tom, what does that mean?\" exclaimed Mr.  Damon. \"That face!\"    \"I don't know,\" answered the young inventor. \"But the sight of some one  looking in here seemed to disturb Mr. Titus. We must follow him.\"    \"Perhaps he saw your giant Koku looking in,\" suggested the odd, little  man who blessed everything he could think of.  \"The sight of his face,  to any one not knowing him, Tom, would be enough to cause fright.\"    \"It wasn't Koku who looked in the window,\" said Tom, decidedly. \"It was  some stranger. Come on.\"    The young inventor and Mr. Damon hurried out after the tunnel  contractor, who was running down the road that led in front of the  Swift homestead.    \"He's chasing some one, Tom,\" called Mr. Damon.    \"Yes, I see he is. But who?\"    \"I can't see any one,\" reported Mr. Damon, who had run down to the  gate, at which his horse was still standing.  Mr. Damon had washed the  dirt from his hands and face, and was wearing one of Mr. Swift's coats  in place of his own split one.    Tom joined the eccentric man and together they looked down the road  after the running Mr. Titus. They were in half a mind to join him, when  they saw him pull up short, raise his hands as though he had given over  the pursuit, and turn back.    \"I guess he got away, whoever he was,\" remarked Tom.  \"We'll walk down  and meet Mr. Titus, and ask him what it all means.\"    Shortly afterward they came up to the contractor, who was breathing  heavily after his run, for he was evidently not used to such exercise.    \"I beg your pardon, Tom Swift, for leaving you and Mr. Damon in such a  fashion,\" said Mr. Titus, \"but I had to act quickly or lose the chance  of catching that rascal. As it was, he got away, but I think I gave him  a scare, and he knows that I saw him. It will make him more cautious in  the future.\"    \"Who was it?\" asked Tom.    \"Well, I didn't have as close a look as I could have wished for,\" the  contractor said, as he walked back toward the house with Tom and Mr.  Damon, \"but I'm pretty sure the face that peered in at us through the  library window was that of Isaac Waddington.\"    \"And who is he, if it isn't asking information that ought not be given  out?\" inquired Mr. Damon.    \"Oh, no, certainly. I can tell you,\" said the contractor.  \"Only  perhaps we had better wait until we get back to the house.    \"Since one of their men was seen lurking around here there may be  others,\" went on Mr. Titus, when the three were once more seated in the  Swift library. \"It is best to be on the safe side. The face I saw, I'm  sure, was that of Waddington, who is a tool of Blakeson & Grinder,  rival tunnel contractors. They put in a bid on this Andes tunnel, but  we were lower in our figures by several thousand dollars, and the  contract was awarded to us.    \"Blakeson & Grinder tried, by every means in their power, to get the  job away from us. They even invoked the aid of some Peruvian  revolutionists and politicians, but we held our ground and began the  work. Since then they have had spies and emissaries on our trail,  trying their best to make us fail in our work, so the Peruvian  officials might abrogate the contract and give it to them.    \"But, so far, we've managed to come out ahead. This Waddington is a  sort of spy, and I've found him dodging me several times of late. I  suppose he wants to find out my plans so as to be ready to jump in the  breach in case we fail.\"    \"Do you think your rivals had anything to do with the difficulties you  are now meeting with in digging the tunnel?\" asked Mr. Damon. Mr. Titus  shook his head.    \"The present difficulties are all of Nature's doing,\" he said. \"It's  just the abnormally hard rock that is bothering us. Only for that we'd  be all right, though we might have petty difficulties because of the  mean acts of Blakeson & Grinder. But I don't fear them.\"    \"How do you think this Waddington, if it was he, knew you were coming  here?\" asked Tom.    \"I can only guess. My brother and I have had some correspondence  regarding you, Tom Swift. That is, I announced my intention of coming  to see you, and my brother wrote me to use my discretion. I wrote back  that I would consult you.    \"Our main office is in New York, where we employ a large clerical and  expert force. There is nothing to prevent one of our stenographers, for  instance, turning traitor and giving copies of the letters of my  brother and myself to our rivals.    \"Mind you, I don't say this was done, and I don't suspect any of our  employees, but it would be an easy matter for any one to know my plans.  I never thought of making a secret of them, or of my trip here. In some  way Waddington found out about the last, and he must have followed me  here. Then he sneaked up under the window, and tried to hear what we  said.\"    \"Do you think he did?\" asked Tom.    \"I wouldn't be surprised. We took no pains to lower our voices. But,  after all, he hasn't learned much that he didn't know before, if he  knew I was coming here. He didn't learn the secret of the explosive  that must be used, and that is the vital thing. For I defy him, or any  other contractor, to blast that hard rock with any known explosive.  We've tried every kind on the market and we've failed. We'll have to  depend on you, Tom Swift, to help us out with some of your giant cannon  powder.\"    \"And I'm not sure that will work,\" said the young inventor. \"I think  I'll have to experiment and make a new explosive, if I conclude to go  to Peru.\"    \"Oh, you'll go all right!\" declared Mr. Titus with a smile. \"I can see  that you are eager for the adventures I am sure you'll find there, and,  besides, your friend here, Mr. Damon, needs you.\"    \"That's what I do, Tom!\" exclaimed the odd man. \"Bless my excursion  ticket, but you must come!\"    \"I'll have to invent the new powder first,\" Tom said.    \"That's what I like to hear!\" exclaimed Mr. Titus. \"It shows you are  thinking of coming with us.\"    Tom only smiled.    \"I am so anxious to get the proper explosive,\" went on Mr. Titus, \"that  I would even purchase it from our rivals, Blakeson & Grinder, if I  thought they had it. But I'm sure they have not, though they may think  they can get it.    \"That may be the reason they are following me so closely.  They may  want to know just when we will fail, and have to give up the contract,  and they may think they can step in and finish the work. But I don't  believe, without your help, Tom Swift, that they can blast that hard  rock, and--\"    \"Well, I'll say this,\" interrupted Tom, \"first come, first served with  me, other things being equal. You have applied to me and, like a  lawyer, I won't go over to the other side now. I consider myself  retained by your firm, Mr. Titus, to invent some sort of explosive, and  if I am successful I shall expect to be paid.\"    \"Oh, of course!\" cried the contractor eagerly.    \"Very good,\" Tom went on. \"You needn't fear that I'll help the other  fellows. Now to get down to business. I must see some samples of this  rock in order to know what kind of explosive force is needed to rend  it.\"    \"I have some in New York,\" went on the contractor. \"I'll have it sent  to you at once. I would have brought it, only it is too heavy to carry  easily, and I was not sure I could engage you.\"    \"Did that fellow--Waddington, I believe you called him--get away from  you?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"Clean away,\" the contractor answered. \"He was a better runner than I.\"    \"It doesn't matter much,\" Tom said. \"He didn't hear anything that would  benefit him, and I'll give my men orders to be on the lookout for him.  What sort of fellow is he, Mr. Titus?\"    The contractor described the eavesdropper, and Mr. Damon exclaimed:    \"Bless my turkey wish-bone! I'm sure I passed that chap when I was  riding over to see you a while ago, Tom.\"    \"You did?\"    \"Yes, on the highway. He inquired the way to your place.  But there was  nothing strange in that, since you employ a number of men, and I  thought this one was coming to look for work. I can't say I liked his  appearance, though.\"    \"No, he isn't a very prepossessing individual,\" commented Mr. Titus.  \"Well, now what's the first thing to be done, Tom Swift?\"    \"Get me some samples of the rock, so I can begin my experiments.\"    \"I'll do that. And now let us consider about going to Peru. For I'm  sure you will be successful in your experiments, and will find for us  just the powder or explosive we need.\"    \"We can go together.\" said Mr. Damon. \"I shall certainly feel more at  home in that wild country if I know Tom Swift is with me, and I will  appreciate the help of you and your friends, Mr. Titus, in  straightening out the tangles of our drug business.\"    \"I'll do all I can for you, Mr. Damon.\"    The three then talked at some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#4)"],[1,"renches,  which they can straddle and wriggle across like some giant worm.    \"And to think that Tom Swift didn't enthuse over these!\" murmured Ned.  \"I wonder what's the matter with him!\"          Chapter IV    Queer Doings      There was a subdued air of activity about the Swift plant.  Subdued,  owing to the fact that it was mostly confined to one building--the new,  large one, about which stretched a high and strong fence, made with  tongue-and-groove boards so that no prying eyes might find a crack,  even, through which to peer.    In and out of the other buildings the workmen went as they pleased,  though there were not many of them, for Tom and his father were  devoting most of their time and energies to what was taking place in  the big, new structure. But here there was an entirely different  procedure.    Workmen went in and out, to be sure, but each time they emerged they  were scrutinized carefully, and when they went in they had to exhibit  their passes to a man on guard at the single entrance; and the passes  were not scrutinized perfunctorily, either.    Near the building, about which there seemed to be an air of mystery,  one day, a week after the events narrated in the opening chapters,  strolled the giant Koku. Not far away, raking up a pile of refuse, was  Eradicate Sampson, the aged colored man of all work. Eradicate  approached nearer and nearer the entrance to the building, pursuing his  task of gathering up leaves, dirt and sticks with the teeth of his  rake. Then Koku, who had been lounging on a bench in the shade of a  tree, Called:    \"No more, Eradicate!\"    \"No mo' whut?\" asked the negro quickly.  \"I didn't axt yo' fo' nuffin  yit!\"    \"No more come here!\" said the giant, pointing to the building and  speaking English with an evident effort.  \"Master say no one come too  close.\"    \"Huh! He didn't go fo' t' mean me!\" exclaimed Eradicate.  \"I kin go  anywheres; I kin!\"    \"Not here!\" and Koku interposed his giant frame between the old man and  the first step leading into the secret building. \"You no come in here.\"    \"Who say so?\"    \"Me--I say so! I on guard. I what you call special  policeman--detectiff--no let enemies in!\"    \"Huh! You's a hot deteckertiff, yo' is!\" snorted Eradicate. \"Anyhow,  dem orders don't mean me! I kin go anywhere, I kin!\"    \"Not here!\" said Koku firmly. \"Master Tom say let nobody come near but  workmen who have got writing-paper. You no got!\"    \"No, but I kin git one, an' I's gwine t' hab it soon! I'll see Massa  Tom, dat's whut I will. I guess yo' ain't de only deteckertiff on de  place. I kin go on guard, too!\" and Eradicate, dropping his rake,  strolled away in his temper to seek the young inventor.    \"Well, Rad, what is it?\" asked Tom, as he met the colored man. The  young inventor was on his way to the mysterious shop. \"What is  troubling you?\"    \"It's dat dar giant. He done says as how he's on guard--a  deteckertiff--an' I can't go nigh dat buildin' t' sweep up de refuse.\"    \"Well, that's right, Rad. I'd prefer that you keep away.  I'm doing  some special work in there and it's--\"    \"Am it dangerous, Massa Tom? I ain't askeered! Anybody whut kin drive  mah mule Boomerang--\"    \"I know, Eradicate, but this isn't so dangerous. It's just secret, and  I don't want too many people about. You can go anywhere else except  there. Koku is on guard.\"    \"Den can't I be, Massa Tom?\" asked the colored man eagerly. \"I kin  guard an' detect same as dat low-down, good-fo'-nuffin white trash  Koku!\"    Tom hesitated.    \"I suppose I could get you a sort of officer's badge,\" he mused, half  aloud.    \"Dat's whut I want!\" eagerly exclaimed Eradicate. \"I ain't gwine hab  dat Koku--dat cocoanut--crowin' ober me! I kin guard an' detect as  good's anybody!\"    And the upshot of it was that Eradicate was given a badge, and put on a  special post, far enough from Koku to keep the two from quarreling, and  where, even if he failed in keeping a proper lookout, the old servant  could do no harm by his oversight.    \"It'll please him, and won't hurt us,\" said Tom to his father. \"Koku  will keep out any prying persons.\"    \"I suppose you are doing well to keep it a secret, Tom,\" said Mr.  Swift, \"but it seems as if you might announce it soon.\"    \"Perhaps we may, Dad, if all goes well. I've given her a partial  shop-tryout, and she works well. But there is still plenty to do. Did I  tell you about meeting Blakeson?\"    \"Yes, and I can't understand why he should be in this vicinity. Do you  think he has had any intimation of what you are doing?\"    \"It's hard to say, and yet I would not be surprised. When Uncle Sam  couldn't keep secret the fact of our first soldiers sailing for France.  How can I expect to keep this secret? But they won't get any details  until I'm ready, I'm sure of that.\"    \"Koku is a good discourager,\" said Mr. Swift, with a chuckle. \"You  couldn't have a better guard, Tom.\"    \"No, and if I can keep him and Eradicate from trying to pull off rival  detective stunts, or 'deteckertiff,' as Rad calls it, I'll be all  right. Now let's have another go at that carburetor. There's our weak  point, for it's getting harder and harder all the while to get  high-grade gasolene, and we'll have to come to alcohol of low proof, or  kerosene, I'm thinking.\"    \"I wouldn't be surprised, Tom. Well, perhaps we can get up a new style  of carburetor that will do the trick. Now look at this needle valve;  I've given it a new turn,\" and father and son went into technical  details connected with their latest invention.    These were busy days at the Swift plant. Men came and went--men with  queerly shaped parcels frequently--and they were admitted to the big  new building after first passing Eradicate and then Koku, and it would  be hard to say which guard was the more careful. Only, of course, Koku  had the final decision, and more than one person was turned back after  Eradicate had passed him, much to the disgust of the negro.    \"Pooh! Dat giant don't know a workman when he sees 'im!\" snorted  Eradicate. \"He so lazy his own se'f dat he don't know a workman! Ef I  sees a spy, Massa Tom, or a crook, I's gwine git him, suah pop!\"    \"I hope you do, Rad. We can't afford to let this secret get out,\" said  the young inventor.    It was one evening, when taking a short cut to his home, that Mr.  Nestor, the father of Mary Nestor, in whom Tom was more than ordinarily  interested, passed not far from the big enclosure which was guarded, on  the factory side, day and night. Inside, though out of sight and hidden  by the high fence, were other guards.    As Mr. Nestor passed along the fence, rather vaguely wondering why it  was so high, tight and strong, he felt the ground trembling beneath his  feet. It rumbled and shook as though a distant train were passing, and  yet there was none due now, for Mr. Nestor had just left one, and  another would not arrive for an hour.    \"That's queer,\" mused Mary's father. \"If I didn't know to the contrary,  I'd say that sounded like heavy guns being fired from a distance, or  else blasting. It seems to come from the Swift place,\" he went on. \"I  wonder what they're up to in there.\"    Suddenly the rumbling became more pronounced, and mingled with it, in  the dusk of the evening, were the shouts of men.    \"Look out!\" some one cried. \"She's going for the fence!\"    A second later there was a cracking and straining of boards, and the  fence near Mr. Nestor bulged out as though something big, powerful and  mighty were pressing it from the inner side.    But the fence held, or else the pressure was removed, for the bulge  went back into place, though some of the boards were splintered.    \"Have to patch that up in the morning,\" called another voice, and Mr.  Nestor recognized it as that of Tom Swift.    \"What queer doings are going on here?\" mused Mary's father. \"Have they  got a wild bull shut up in there, and is he trying to get out? Lucky  for me he didn't,\" and he hurried on, the rumbling noise become fainter  until it died away altogether.    That night, after his supper and while reading the paper and smoking a  cigar, Mr. Nestor spoke to his daughter.    \"Mary, have you seen anything of Tom Swift lately?\"    \"Why, yes, Father. He was over for a little while the other night, but  he didn't stay long. Why do you ask?\"    \"Oh, nothing special. I just came past his place and I heard some queer  noises, that's all. He's up to some more of his tricks, I guess. Has be  enlisted yet?\"    \"No.    \"Is he going to?\"    \"I don't know,\" and Mary seemed a bit put out by this simple question.  \"What do you mean by his tricks?\" she asked, and a close observer might  have thought she was anxious to get away from the subject of Tom's  enlistment.    \"Oh, like that one when he sent you something in a box labeled  'dynamite,' and gave us all a scare. You can't tell what Tom Swift is  going to do next. He's up to something now, I'll wager, and I don't  believe any good will come of it.\"    \"You didn't think so after he sent his wireless message, and saved us  from Earthquake Island,\" said Mary, smiling.    \"Hum! Well, that was different,\" snapped Mr. Nestor. \"This time I'm  sure he's up to some nonsense! The idea of crashing down a fence! Why  doesn't he enlist like the other chaps, or sell Liberty Bonds like Ned  Newton?\" and Mr. Nestor looked sharply at his daughter. \"Ned gave up a  big salary as the Swifts financial man--a place he had held for a  year--to go back to the bank for less, just so he could help the  Government in the financial end of this war. Is Tom doing as much for  his country?\"    \"I'm sure I don't know,\" answered Mary; and soon after, with averted  face, she left the room.    \"Hum! Queer goings on,\" mused Mr. Nestor. \"Tom Swift may be all right,  but he's got an unbalanced streak in him that will bear looking out  for, that's what I think!\"    And having settled this matter, at least to his own satisfaction, Mr.  Nestor resumed his smoking "]]]
