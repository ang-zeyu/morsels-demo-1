Armigeri soltum nihil a modo fert sibi tutum,    Reddidit immolutum morti generale tributum,    Spiritus exutum se gaudeat esse solutum    Est ubi virtutum regnum sine labe est statum.    I shall take a quotation from a small piece of his called the Envious  Man and the Miser; by which it will appear, that he was not, as  Winstanley says, a refiner of our language, but on the other hand,  that poetry owes him few or no obligations.    Of the Envious MAN and the MISER.      Of Jupiter thus I find ywrite,    How, whilom, that he woulde wite,    Upon the plaintes, which he herde    Among the men, how that it farde,    As of her wronge condition    To do justificacion.    And, for that cause, downe he sent    An angel, which aboute went,    That he the sooth knowe maie.    Besides the works already mentioned our poet wrote the following:    De Compunctione Cordi, in one book.    Chronicon Ricardi secundi.    Ad Henricum Quartum, in one book.    Ad eundem de Laude Pacis, in one book.    De Rege Henrico, quarto, in one book.    De Peste Vitiorum, in one book.    Scrutinium Lucis, in one book.    De Regimine Principum.    De Conjugii Dignitate.    De Amoris Varietate.           *       *       *       *       *      JOHN LYDGATE,    Commonly called the monk of Bury, because a native of that place. He  was another disciple and admirer of Chaucer, and it must be owned far  excelled his master, in the article of versification. After sometime  spent in our English universities, he travelled thro' France and  Italy, improving his time to the accomplishment of learning the  languages and arts. Pitseus says, he was not only an elegant poet, and  an eloquent rhetorician, but also an expert mathematician, an acute  philosopher, and no mean divine. His verses were so very smooth, and  indeed to a modern ear they appear so, that it was said of him by his  contemporaries, that his wit was framed and fashioned by the Muses  themselves. After his return from France and Italy, he became tutor  to many noblemen's sons, and for his excellent endowments was much  esteemed and reverenced by them. He writ a poem called the Life  and Death of Hector, from which I shall give a specimen of his  versification.      I am a monk by my profession    In Bury, called John Lydgate by my name,    And wear a habit of perfection;    (Although my life agree not with the same)    That meddle should with things spiritual,    As I must needs confess unto you all.      But seeing that I did herein proceed    At[1] his commands whom I could not refuse,    I humbly do beseech all those that read,    Or leisure have this story to peruse,    If any fault therein they find to be,    Or error that committed is by me,      That they will of their gentleness take pain,    The rather to correct and mend the same,    Than rashly to condemn it with disdain,    For well I wot it is not without blame,    Because I know the verse therein is wrong    As being some too short, and some too long.    His prologue to the story of Thebes, a tale (as he says) he was  constrained to tell, at the command of his host of the Tabard in  Southwark, whom he found in Canterbury with the rest of the pilgrims  who went to visit St. Thomas's shrine, is remarkably smooth for  the age in which he writ. This story was first written in Latin by  Chaucer, and translated by Lydgate into English verse, Pitseus says  he writ, partly in prose and partly in verse, many exquisite learned  books, amongst which are eclogues, odes, and satires. He flourished in  the reign of Henry VI. and died in the sixtieth year of his age, ann.  1440. and was buried in his own convent at Bury, with this epitaph,      Mortuus saeclo, superis superstes,    Hic jacet Lydgate tumulatus urna:    Qui suit quondam celebris Britannae,    Fama poesis.    Which is thus rendered into English by Winstanly;      Dead in this world, living above the sky,    Intomb'd within this urn doth Lydgate lie;    In former times fam'd for his poetry,    All over England.    [Footnote 1: K. Henry V.]           *       *       *       *       *      JOHN HARDING.    John Harding, the famous English Chronologer, was born (says Bale) in  the Northern parts, and probably Yorkshire, being an Esquire of an  eminent parentage. He was a man addicted both to arms and arts, in the  former of which he seems to have been the greatest proficient:  His first military exploit was under Robert Umsreuil, governor of  Roxborough Castle, where he distinguished himself against the Scots,  before which the King of Scotland was then encamped, and unfortunately  lost his life. He afterwards followed the standard of Edward IV. to  whose interest both in prosperity and distress he honourably adhered.  But what endeared him most to the favour of that Prince, and was  indeed the masterpiece of his service, was his adventuring into  Scotland, and by his courteous insinuating behaviour, so far  ingratiating himself into the favour of their leading men, that he  procured the privilege of looking into their records and original  letters, a copy of which he brought to England and presented to the  King. This successful achievement established him in his Prince's  affections, as he was solicitous to know how often the Kings of  Scotland had taken oaths of fealty and subjected themselves to the  English Monarchs in order to secure their crown. These submissions  are warmly disputed by the Scotch historians, who in honour of their  country contend that they were only yielded for Cumberland and some  parcels of land possessed by them in England south of Tweed; and  indeed when the warlike temper and invincible spirit of that nation is  considered, it is more than probable, that the Scotch historians in  this particular contend only for truth. Our author wrote a chronicle  in verse of all our English Kings from Brute to King Edward IV. for  which Dr. Fuller and Winstanly bestow great encomiums upon him; but  he seems to me to be totally destitute of poetry, both from the  wretchedness of his lines, and the unhappiness of his subject, a  chronicle being of all others the driest, and the least susceptible of  poetical ornament; but let the reader judge by the specimen subjoined.  He died about the year 1461, being then very aged. From Gower to  Barclay it must be observed, that Kings and Princes were constantly  the patrons of poets.    On the magnificent houshold of King Richard II,      Truly I herd Robert Irelese say,    Clark of the Green Cloth, and that to the houshold,    Came every day, forth most part alway,    Ten thousand folk by his messes told;    That followed the house, aye as they wold,    And in the kitchen, three hundred scruitours,    And in eche office many occupiours,    And ladies faire, with their gentlewomen    Chamberers also, and launderers,    Three hundred of them were occupied then;    There was great pride among the officers,    And of all men far passing their compeers,    Of rich arraye, and much more costous,    Then was before, or sith, and more precious.           *       *       *       *       *      JOHN SKELTON    Was born of an ancient family in Cumberland, he received his education  at Oxford, and entering into holy orders was made rector of Dysso in  Norfolk in the reign of Henry VIII. tho' more probably he appeared  first in that of Henry VII. and may be said to be the growth of that  time. That he was a learned man Erasmus has confirmed, who in his  letter to King Henry VIII. stileth him, Britanicarum Literarum Lumen  & Decus: Tho' his stile is rambling and loose, yet he was not without  invention, and his satire is strongly pointed. He lived near fourscore  years after Chaucer, but seems to have made but little improvement in  versification. He wrote some bitter satires against the clergy, and  particularly, his keen reflections on Cardinal Wolsey drew on him  such severe prosecutions, that he was obliged to fly for sanctuary to  Westminster, under the protection of Islip the Abbot, where he died in  the year 1529. It appears by his poem entitled, The Crown of Laurel,  that his performances were numerous, and such as remain are chiefly  these, Philip Sparrow, Speak Parrot, the Death of King Edward IV, a  Treatise of the Scots, Ware the Hawk, the Tunning of Elianer Rumpkin.  In these pieces there is a very rich vein of wit and humour, tho' much  debased by the rust of the age he lived in. His satires are remarkably  broad, open and ill-bred; the verse cramped by a very short measure,  and encumbered with such a profusion of rhimes, as makes the poet  appear almost as ridiculous as those he endeavours to expose. In his  more serious pieces he is not guilty of this absurdity; and confines  himself to a regular stanza, according to the then reigning mode.  His Bouge of Court is a poem of some merit: it abounds with wit and  imagination, and shews him well versed in human nature, and the  insinuating manners of a court. The allegorical characters are finely  described, and well sustained; the fabric of the whole I believe  entirely his own, and not improbably may have the honour of furnishing  a hint even to the inimitable Spencer. How or by whose interest he was  made Laureat, or whether it was a title he assumed to himself, cannot  be determined, neither is his principal patron any where named; but if  his poem of the Crown Lawrel before mentioned has any covert meaning,  he had the happiness of having the Ladies for his friends, and the  countess of Surry, the lady Elizabeth Howard, and many others united  their services in his favour. When on his death-bed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],[0,"Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#5)"],[1,"of so great a  labor.  And when they cut long stakes, sharpened at their upper ends,  and set them at intervals upright in the bottom of the pit, his  wonderment but increased, nor was it satisfied with the placing of the  light cross-poles over the pit, or the careful arrangement of leaves  and earth which completely hid from view the work the black men had  performed.    When they were done they surveyed their handiwork with evident  satisfaction, and Tarzan surveyed it, too.  Even to his practiced eye  there remained scarce a vestige of evidence that the ancient game trail  had been tampered with in any way.    So absorbed was the ape-man in speculation as to the purpose of the  covered pit that he permitted the blacks to depart in the direction of  their village without the usual baiting which had rendered him the  terror of Mbonga's people and had afforded Tarzan both a vehicle of  revenge and a source of inexhaustible delight.    Puzzle as he would, however, he could not solve the mystery of the  concealed pit, for the ways of the blacks were still strange ways to  Tarzan.  They had entered his jungle but a short time before--the first  of their kind to encroach upon the age-old supremacy of the beasts  which laired there.  To Numa, the lion, to Tantor, the elephant, to the  great apes and the lesser apes, to each and all of the myriad creatures  of this savage wild, the ways of man were new.  They had much to learn  of these black, hairless creatures that walked erect upon their hind  paws--and they were learning it slowly, and always to their sorrow.    Shortly after the blacks had departed, Tarzan swung easily to the  trail.  Sniffing suspiciously, he circled the edge of the pit.  Squatting upon his haunches, he scraped away a little earth to expose  one of the cross-bars. He sniffed at this, touched it, cocked his head  upon one side, and contemplated it gravely for several minutes.  Then  he carefully re-covered it, arranging the earth as neatly as had the  blacks.  This done, he swung himself back among the branches of the  trees and moved off in search of his hairy fellows, the great apes of  the tribe of Kerchak.    Once he crossed the trail of Numa, the lion, pausing for a moment to  hurl a soft fruit at the snarling face of his enemy, and to taunt and  insult him, calling him eater of carrion and brother of Dango, the  hyena.  Numa, his yellow-green eyes round and burning with concentrated  hate, glared up at the dancing figure above him.  Low growls vibrated  his heavy jowls and his great rage transmitted to his sinuous tail a  sharp, whiplike motion; but realizing from past experience the futility  of long distance argument with the ape-man, he turned presently and  struck off into the tangled vegetation which hid him from the view of  his tormentor.  With a final scream of jungle invective and an apelike  grimace at his departing foe, Tarzan continued along his way.    Another mile and a shifting wind brought to his keen nostrils a  familiar, pungent odor close at hand, and a moment later there loomed  beneath him a huge, gray-black bulk forging steadily along the jungle  trail.  Tarzan seized and broke a small tree limb, and at the sudden  cracking sound the ponderous figure halted.  Great ears were thrown  forward, and a long, supple trunk rose quickly to wave to and fro in  search of the scent of an enemy, while two weak, little eyes peered  suspiciously and futilely about in quest of the author of the noise  which had disturbed his peaceful way.    Tarzan laughed aloud and came closer above the head of the pachyderm.    \"Tantor! Tantor!\" he cried.  \"Bara, the deer, is less fearful than  you--you, Tantor, the elephant, greatest of the jungle folk with the  strength of as many Numas as I have toes upon my feet and fingers upon  my hands.  Tantor, who can uproot great trees, trembles with fear at  the sound of a broken twig.\"    A rumbling noise, which might have been either a sign of contempt or a  sigh of relief, was Tantor's only reply as the uplifted trunk and ears  came down and the beast's tail dropped to normal; but his eyes still  roved about in search of Tarzan.  He was not long kept in suspense,  however, as to the whereabouts of the ape-man, for a second later the  youth dropped lightly to the broad head of his old friend.  Then  stretching himself at full length, he drummed with his bare toes upon  the thick hide, and as his fingers scratched the more tender surfaces  beneath the great ears, he talked to Tantor of the gossip of the jungle  as though the great beast understood every word that he said.    Much there was which Tarzan could make Tantor understand, and though  the small talk of the wild was beyond the great, gray dreadnaught of  the jungle, he stood with blinking eyes and gently swaying trunk as  though drinking in every word of it with keenest appreciation.  As a  matter of fact it was the pleasant, friendly voice and caressing hands  behind his ears which he enjoyed, and the close proximity of him whom  he had often borne upon his back since Tarzan, as a little child, had  once fearlessly approached the great bull, assuming upon the part of  the pachyderm the same friendliness which filled his own heart.    In the years of their association Tarzan had discovered that he  possessed an inexplicable power to govern and direct his mighty friend.  At his bidding, Tantor would come from a great distance--as far as his  keen ears could detect the shrill and piercing summons of the  ape-man--and when Tarzan was squatted upon his head, Tantor would  lumber through the jungle in any direction which his rider bade him go.  It was the power of the man-mind over that of the brute and it was just  as effective as though both fully understood its origin, though neither  did.    For half an hour Tarzan sprawled there upon Tantor's back.  Time had no  meaning for either of them.  Life, as they saw it, consisted  principally in keeping their stomachs filled.  To Tarzan this was a  less arduous labor than to Tantor, for Tarzan's stomach was smaller,  and being omnivorous, food was less difficult to obtain.  If one sort  did not come readily to hand, there were always many others to satisfy  his hunger.  He was less particular as to his diet than Tantor, who  would eat only the bark of certain trees, and the wood of others, while  a third appealed to him only through its leaves, and these, perhaps,  just at certain seasons of the year.    Tantor must needs spend the better part of his life in filling his  immense stomach against the needs of his mighty thews.  It is thus with  all the lower orders--their lives are so occupied either with searching  for food or with the processes of digestion that they have little time  for other considerations.  Doubtless it is this handicap which has kept  them from advancing as rapidly as man, who has more time to give to  thought upon other matters.    However, these questions troubled Tarzan but little, and Tantor not at  all.  What the former knew was that he was happy in the companionship  of the elephant.  He did not know why.  He did not know that because he  was a human being--a normal, healthy human being--he craved some living  thing upon which to lavish his affection.  His childhood playmates  among the apes of Kerchak were now great, sullen brutes.  They felt nor  inspired but little affection.  The younger apes Tarzan still played  with occasionally.  In his savage way he loved them; but they were far  from satisfying or restful companions.  Tantor was a great mountain of  calm, of poise, of stability.  It was restful and satisfying to sprawl  upon his rough pate and pour one's vague hopes and aspirations into the  great ears which flapped ponderously to and fro in apparent  understanding.  Of all the jungle folk, Tantor commanded Tarzan's  greatest love since Kala had been taken from him.  Sometimes Tarzan  wondered if Tantor reciprocated his affection.  It was difficult to  know.    It was the call of the stomach--the most compelling and insistent call  which the jungle knows--that took Tarzan finally back to the trees and  off in search of food, while Tantor continued his interrupted journey  in the opposite direction.    For an hour the ape-man foraged.  A lofty nest yielded its fresh, warm  harvest.  Fruits, berries, and tender plantain found a place upon his  menu in the order that he happened upon them, for he did not seek such  foods.  Meat, meat, meat! It was always meat that Tarzan of the Apes  hunted; but sometimes meat eluded him, as today.    And as he roamed the jungle his active mind busied itself not alone  with his hunting, but with many other subjects.  He had a habit of  recalling often the events of the preceding days and hours.  He lived  over his visit with Tantor; he cogitated upon the digging blacks and  the strange, covered pit they had left behind them.  He wondered again  and again what its purpose might be.  He compared perceptions and  arrived at judgments.  He compared judgments, reaching conclusions--not  always correct ones, it is true, but at least he used his brain for the  purpose God intended it, which was the less difficult because he was  not handicapped by the second-hand, and usually erroneous, judgment of  others.    And as he puzzled over the covered pit, there loomed suddenly before  his mental vision a huge, gray-black bulk which lumbered ponderously  along a jungle trail.  Instantly Tarzan tensed to the shock of a sudden  fear.  Decision and action usually occurred simultaneously in the life  of the ape-man, and now he was away through the leafy branches ere the  realization of the pit's purpose had scarce formed in his mind.    Swinging from swaying limb to swaying limb, he raced through the middle  terraces where the trees grew close together.  Again he dropped to the  ground and sped, silently and light of foot, over the carpet of  decaying vegetation, only to leap again into the"]]]
