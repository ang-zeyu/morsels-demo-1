[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12473"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 06 (#5)"],[1," by pens in  Paris.\"    During the first years of his sojourn in Paris Heine entered gleefully  into all the enjoyment and stimulation that the gay capital had to  offer. \"I feel like a fish in water\" is a common expression of  contentment with one's surroundings; but when one fish inquires after  the health of another, he now says, Heine told a friend, \"I feel like  Heine in Paris.\" The well-accredited German poet quickly secured  admission to the circle of artists, journalists, politicians, and  reformers, and became a familiar figure on the boulevards. In October,  1834, be made the acquaintance of a young Frenchwoman, Crescence  Eugenie Mirat, or Mathilde, as he called her, and fell violently in  love with her. She was a woman of great personal attractiveness, but  entirely without education, frivolous, and passionate. They were soon  united; not for long, Heine thought, and he made efforts to escape  from her seductive charms, but ineffectually; and like Tannhaeuser, he  was drawn back to his Frau Venus with an attachment passing all  understanding. From December, 1835, Heine regarded her as his wife,  and in 1841 they were married. But Mathilde was no good housekeeper;  Heine was frequently in financial straits; he quarreled with his  relatives, as well as with literary adversaries in Germany and  France; and only after considerable negotiation was peace declared,  and the continuation of a regular allowance arranged with Uncle  Salomon.    [Illustration: HEINRICH HEINE E. HADER]    Moreover, Heine's health was undermined. In the latter thirties he  suffered often from headaches and afflictions of the eyes; in the  middle of the forties paralysis of the spinal cord began to manifest  itself; and for the last ten years of his life he was a hopelessly  stricken invalid, finally doomed for five years to that \"mattress  grave\" which his fortitude no less than his woeful humor has  pathetically glorified. His wife cared for him dutifully, he was  visited by many distinguished men of letters, and in 1855 a  ministering angel came to him in the person of Elise von Krinitz  (\"Camille Selden\") whom he called \"_Die Mouche_\" and for whom he wrote  his last poem, _The Passion Flower_, a kind of apology for his life.    Meantime contentions, tribulations, and a wasting frame seemed only to  sharpen the wits of the indomitable warrior. _New Songs_ (1844)  contains, along with negligible cynical pieces, a number of love songs  no whit inferior to those of the _Book of Songs_, romances, and  scorching political satires. The _Romanzero_ (1851) is not unfairly  represented by such a masterpiece as _The Battlefield of Hastings_.  And from this last period we have two quasi-epic poems: _Atta Troll_  (1847; written in 1842) and _Germany_ (1844), the fruit of the first  of Heine's two trips across the Rhine.    Historically and poetically, _Atta Troll_ is one of the most  remarkable of Heine's works. He calls it _Das letzte freie Waldlied  der Romantik_ (\"The last free forest-song of romanticism.\") Having for  its principal scene the most romantic spot in Europe, the valley of  Roncesvaux, and for its principal character a dancing bear, the  impersonation of those good characters and talentless men who, in the  early forties, endeavored to translate the prose of Young Germany into  poetry, the poem flies to the merriest, maddest height of romanticism  in order by the aid of magic to kill the bear and therewith the vogue  of poetry degraded to practical purposes. Heine knew whereof he  spoke; for he had himself been a mad romanticist, a Young German, and  a political poet; and he was a true prophet; for, though he did not  himself enter the promised land, he lived to see, in the more refined  romanticism of the Munich School and the poetic realism of Hebbel and  Ludwig, the dawn of a new day in the history of German literature.    Heine did not enter the promised land. Neither can we truthfully say  that he saw it as it was destined to be. His eye was on the present,  and in the present he more clearly discerned what ought not to be than  what gave promise of a better future. In the war for the liberation of  humanity he professed to be, and he was, a brave soldier; but he  lacked the soldier's prime requisite, discipline. He never took a  city, because he could not rule his spirit. Democracy was inscribed  upon his banner, sympathy for the disenfranchised bound him to it, but  not that charity which seeketh not her own, nor the loyalty that  abides the day when imperfection shall become perfection. Sarcasm was  his weapon, ridicule his plan of campaign, and destruction his only  accomplishment.    We shall not say that the things destroyed by Heine deserved a better  fate. We shall not think of him either as a leader or as a follower in  a great national movement. He was not the one man of his generation  through whom the national consciousness, even national discontent,  found expression; he was the man whose self-expressions aroused the  widest interest and touched the tenderest chords. To be called perhaps  an alien, and certainly no monumental German character, Heine  nevertheless made use, with consummate artistry, of the fulness of  German culture at a time when many of the after-born staggered under  the weight of a heritage greater than they could bear.

My dreams have paled and faded long ago,      Faded the very form they most adored,      Nothing is left me but what once I poured    Into pathetic verse with feverish glow.      Thou, orphaned song, art left. Do thou, too, fade!      Go, seek that visioned form long lost in night,      And say from me--if you upon it light--    With airy breath I greet that airy shade!           *       *       *       *       *    SONGS (1822)    1 [2]      Oh, fair cradle of my sorrow,      Oh, fair tomb of peace for me,    Oh, fair town, my last good-morrow,      Last farewell I say to thee!      Fare thee well, thou threshold holy,      Where my lady's footsteps stir,    And that spot, still worshipped lowly,      Where mine eyes first looked on her!      Had I but beheld thee never,      Thee, my bosom's beauteous queen,    Wretched now, and wretched ever,      Oh, I should not thus have been!      Touch thy heart?--I would not dare that:      Ne'er did I thy love implore;    Might I only breathe the air that      Thou didst breathe, I asked no more.      Yet I could not brook thy spurning,      Nor thy cruel words of scorn;    Madness in my brain is burning,      And my heart is sick and torn.      So I go, downcast and dreary,      With my pilgrim staff to stray,    Till I lay my head aweary      In some cool grave far away.      2 [3]      Cliff and castle quiver grayly      From the mirror of the Rhine    Where my little boat swims gaily;      Round her prow the ripples shine.      Heart at ease I watch them thronging--      Waves of gold with crisping crest,    Till awakes a half-lulled longing      Cherished deep within my breast.      Temptingly the ripples greet me      Luring toward the gulf beneath,    Yet I know that should they meet me      They would drag me to my death.      Lovely visage, treacherous bosom,      Guile beneath and smile above,    Stream, thy dimpling wavelet's blossom      Laughs as falsely as my love.      3[4]      I despaired at first--believing      I should never bear it. Now    I have borne it--I have borne it.      Only never ask me How.           *       *       *       *       *    A LYRICAL INTERMEZZO (1822-23)    1[5]      'Twas in the glorious month of May,      When all the buds were blowing,    I felt--ah me, how sweet it was!--      Love in my heart a-growing.      'Twas in the glorious month of May,      When all the birds were quiring,    In burning words I told her all      My yearning, my aspiring.    2[6]      Where'er my bitter tear-drops fall,      The fairest flowers arise;    And into choirs of nightingales      Are turned my bosom's sighs.      And wilt thou love me, thine shall be      The fairest flowers that spring,    And at thy window evermore      The nightingales shall sing.    3[7]      The rose and the lily, the moon and the dove,      Once loved I them all with a perfect love.    I love them no longer, I love alone      The Lovely, the Graceful, the Pure, the One    Who twines in one wreath all their beauty and love,      And rose is, and lily, and moon and dove.    4[8]      Dear, when I look into thine eyes,    My deepest sorrow straightway flies;    But when I kiss thy mouth, ah, then    No thought remains of bygone pain!      And when I lean upon thy breast,    No dream of heaven could be more blest;    But, when thou say'st thou lovest me,    I fall to weeping bitterly.    5[9]      Thy face, that fair, sweet face I know,    I dreamed of it awhile ago;    It is an angel's face, so mild--    And yet, so sadly pale, poor child!      Only the lips are rosy bright,    But soon cold Death will kiss them white,    And quench the light of Paradise    That shines from out those earnest eyes.    6[10]      Lean close thy cheek against my cheek,    That our tears together may blend, love,    And press thy heart upon my heart,    That from both one flame may ascend, love!

For those who _must_ have gravy with these meats, let  it be made in any way they like, and served in a boat. No meat can be  well roasted except on a spit turned by a jack, and before a steady  clear fire--other methods are no better than baking. Many cooks are in  the habit of half boiling the meats to plump them as they term it,  before they are spitted, but it destroys their fine flavour. Whatever is  to be boiled, must be put into cold water with a little salt, which will  cook them regularly. When they are put in boiling water, the outer side  is done too much, before the inside gets heated. Nice lard is much  better than butter for basting roasted meats, or for frying. To choose  butchers' meat, you must see that the fat is not yellow, and that the  lean parts are of a fine close grain, a lively colour, and will feel  tender when pinched. Poultry should be well covered with white fat; if  the bottom of the breast bone be gristly, it is young, but if it be a  hard bone, it is an old one. Fish are judged by the liveliness of their  eyes, and bright red of their gills. Dredge every thing with flour  before it is put on to boil, and be sure to add salt to the water.    Fish, and all other articles for frying, after being nicely prepared,  should be laid on a board and dredged with flour or meal mixed with  salt: when it becomes dry on one side, turn it, and dredge the other.  For broiling, have very clear coals, sprinkle a little salt and pepper  over the pieces, and when done, dish them, and pour over some melted  butter and chopped parsley--this is for broiled veal, wild fowl, birds  or poultry: beef-steaks and mutton chops require only a table-spoonful  of hot water to be poured over. Slice an onion in the dish before you  put in the steaks or chops, and garnish both with rasped horse-radish.  To have viands served in perfection, the dishes should be made hot,  either by setting them over hot water, or by putting some in them, and  the instant the meats are laid in and garnished, put on a pewter dish  cover. A dinner looks very enticing, when the steam rises from each dish  on removing the covers, and if it be judiciously _ordered_, will have a  double relish. Profusion is not elegance--a dinner justly calculated for  the company, and consisting for the greater part of small articles,  correctly prepared, and neatly served up, will make a much more pleasing  appearance to the sight, and give a far greater gratification to the  appetite, than a table loaded with food, and from the multiplicity of  dishes, unavoidably neglected in the preparation, and served up cold.    There should always be a supply of brown flour kept in readiness to  thicken brown gravies, which must be prepared in the following manner:  put a pint of flour in a Dutch oven, with some coals under it; keep  constantly stirring it until it is uniformly of a dark brown, but none  of it burnt, which would look like dirt in the gravy. All kitchens  should be provided with a saw for trimming meat, and also with larding  needles.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF A-LA-MODE.    Take the bone from a round of beef, fill the space with a forcemeat made  of the crumbs of a stale loaf, four ounces of marrow, two heads of  garlic chopped with thyme and parsley, some nutmeg, cloves, pepper and  salt, mix it to a paste with the yelks of four eggs beaten, stuff the  lean part of the round with it, and make balls of the remainder; sew a  fillet of strong linen wide enough to keep it round and compact, put it  in a vessel just sufficiently large to hold it, add a pint of red wine,  cover it with sheets of tin or iron, set it in a brick oven properly  heated, and bake it three hours; when done, skim the fat from the gravy,  thicken it with brown flour, add some mushroom and walnut catsup, and  serve it up garnished with forcemeat balls fried. It is still better  when eaten cold with sallad.           *       *       *       *       *    BRISKET OF BEEF BAKED.    Bone a brisket of beef, and make holes in it with a sharp knife about an  inch apart, fill them alternately with fat bacon, parsley and oysters,  all chopped small and seasoned with pounded cloves and nutmeg, pepper  and salt, dredge it well with flour, lay it in a pan with a pint of red  wine and a large spoonful of lemon pickle; bake it three hours, take the  fat from the gravy and strain it; serve it up garnished with green  pickles.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF OLIVES.    Cut slices from a fat rump of beef six inches long and half an inch  thick, beat them well with a pestle; make a forcemeat of bread crumbs,  fat bacon chopped, parsley, a little onion, some shred suet, pounded  mace, pepper and salt; mix it up with the yelks of eggs, and spread a  thin layer over each slice of beef, roll it up tight, and secure the  rolls with skewers, set them before the fire, and turn them till they  are a nice brown; have ready a pint of good gravy, thickened with brown  flour and a spoonful of butter, a gill of red wine, with two spoonsful  of mushroom catsup, lay the rolls in it, and stew them till tender;  garnish with forcemeat balls.           *       *       *       *       *    TO STEW A RUMP OF BEEF.    Take out as much of the bone as can be done with a saw, that it may lie  flat on the dish, stuff it with forcemeat made as before directed, lay  it in a pot with two quarts of water, a pint of red wine, some carrots  and turnips cut in small pieces and stewed over it, a head of cellery  cut up, a few cloves of garlic, some pounded cloves, pepper and salt,  stew it gently till sufficiently done, skim the fat off, thicken the  gravy, and serve it up; garnish with little bits of puff paste nicely  baked, and scraped horse-radish.           *       *       *       *       *    A FRICANDO OF BEEF.    Cut a few slices of beef six inches long, two or three wide, and one  thick, lard them with bacon, dredge them well, and make them a nice  brown before a brisk fire; stew them half an hour in a well seasoned  gravy, put some stewed sorrel or spinage in the dish, lay on the beef,  and pour over a sufficient quantity of gravy; garnish with fried balls.           *       *       *       *       *    AN EXCELLENT METHOD OF DRESSING BEEF.    Take a rib roasting piece that has been hanging ten days or a fortnight,  bone it neatly, rub some salt over it and roll it tight, binding it  around with twine, put the spit through the inner fold without sticking  it in the flesh, skewer it well and roast it nicely; when nearly done,  dredge and froth it; garnish with scraped horse-radish.           *       *       *       *       *    TO COLLAR A FLANK OF BEEF.    Get a nice flank of beef, rub it well with a large portion of saltpetre  and common salt, let it remain ten days, then wash it clean, take off  the outer and inner skin with the gristle, spread it on a board, and  cover the inside with the following mixture: parsley, sage, thyme  chopped fine, pepper, salt and pounded cloves; roll it up, sew a cloth  over it, and bandage that with tape, boil it gently five or six hours,  when cold, lay it on a board without undoing it, put another board on  the top, with a heavy weight on it; let it remain twenty-four hours,  take off the bandages, cut a thin slice from each end, serve it up  garnished with green pickle and sprigs of parsley.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE HUNTERS' BEEF.    Select a fine fat round weighing about twenty-five pounds, take three  ounces saltpetre, one ounce of cloves, half an ounce of alspice, a large  nutmeg, and a quart of salt; pound them all together very fine, take the  bone out, rub it well with this mixture on both sides, put some of it at  the bottom of a tub just large enough to hold the beef, lay it in and  strew the remainder on the top, rub it well every day for two weeks, and  spread the mixture over it; at the end of this time, wash the beef, bind  it with tape, to keep it round and compact, filling the hole where the  bone was with a piece of fat, lay it in a pan of convenient size, strew  a little suet over the top, and pour on it a pint of water, cover the  pan with a coarse crust and a thick paper over that, it will take five  hours baking; when cold take off the tape. It is a delicious relish at  twelve o'clock, or for supper, eaten with vinegar, mustard, oil, or  sallad. Skim the grease from the gravy and bottle it; it makes an  excellent seasoning for any made dish.           *       *       *       *       *    A NICE LITTLE DISH OF BEEF.    Mince cold roast beef, fat and lean, very fine, add chopped onion,  pepper, salt, and a little good gravy, fill scollop shells two parts  full, and fill them up with potatos mashed smooth with cream, put a bit  of butter on the top, and set them in an oven to brown.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF STEAKS.    The best part of the beef for steaks, is the seventh and eighth ribs,  the fat and lean are better mixed, and it is more tender than the rump  if it be kept long enough; cut the steaks half an inch thick, beat them  a little, have fine clear coals, rub the bars of the gridiron with a  cloth dipped in lard before you put it over the coals, that none may  drip to cause a bad smell, put no salt on till you dish them, broil them  quick, turning them frequently; the dish must be very hot, some slices  of onion in it, lay in the steaks, sprinkle a little salt, and pour over  them a spoonful of water and one of mushroom catsup, both made boiling  hot, garnish with scraped horse-radish, and put on a hot dish cover.  Every thing must be in readiness, for the great excellence of a beef  steak lies in having it immediately from the gridiron.           *       *       *       *       *    TO HASH BEEF.    Cut slices of raw beef, put them in a stew pan with a little water, some  catsup, a clove of garlic,"]]]
