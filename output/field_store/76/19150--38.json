[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12235"],[0,"Popular Law-making (#5)"],[1,"even to Charles the First  all the statutes of the realm fill but five volumes. The legislation  under Cromwell was all repealed; but the bulk, both under him and  after, was far greater. For legislation seems to be considered a  democratic idea; \"judge-made law\" to be thought aristocratic. And so  in our republic; especially as, during the Revolution, the sole power  was vested in our legislative bodies, and we tried to cover a still  wider field, with democratic legislatures dominated by radicals. Thus  at first the American people got the notion of law-making; of the  making of new law, by legislatures, frequently elected; and in that  most radical period of all, from about 1830 to 1860, the time of  \"isms\" and reforms--full of people who wanted to legislate and make  the world good by law, with a chance to work in thirty different  States--the result has been that the bulk of legislation in this  country, in the first half of the last century, is probably one  thousandfold the entire law-making of England for the five centuries  preceding. And we have by no means got over it yet; probably the  output of legislation in this country to-day is as great as it ever  was. If any citizen thinks that anything is wrong, he, or she (as it  is almost more likely to be), rushes to some legislature to get a new  law passed. Absolutely different is this idea from the old English  notion of law as something already existing. They have forgotten  that completely, and have the modern American notion of law, as  a ready-made thing, a thing made to-day to meet the emergency of  to-morrow. They have gotten over the notion that any parliament, or  legislature, or sovereign, should only _sign_ the law--and I say sign  advisedly because he doesn't enact it, doesn't create it, but signs a  written statement of law already existing; all idea that it should be  justified by custom, experiment, has been forgotten. And here is the  need and the value of this our study; for the changes that are being  made by new legislation in this country are probably more important  to-day than anything that is being done by the executive or the  judiciary--the other two departments of the government.    But before coming down to our great mass of legislation here it will  be wise to consider the early English legislation, especially that  part which is alive to-day, or which might be alive to-day. I  mentioned one moment ago thirty pages as possibly containing the bulk  of it. I once attempted to make an abstract of such legislation in  early England as is significant to us to-day in this country;[1] not  the merely political legislation, for ours is a sociological study.  We are concerned with those statutes which affect private citizens,  individual rights, men and women in their lives and businesses; not  matters of state, of the king and the commons, or the constitution of  government. Except incidentally, we shall not go into executive or  political questions, but the sociological--I wish there were some  simpler word for it--let us say, the _human_ legislation; legislation  that concerns not the government, the king, or the state, but each man  in his relations to every other; that deals with property, marriage,  divorce, private rights, labor, the corporations, combinations,  trusts, taxation, rates, police power, and the other great questions  of the day, and indeed of all time.    [Footnote 1: See \"Federal and State Constitutions,\" book II, chap. 2.]    Had it not been for the Conquest, it would hardly have been necessary  to have enacted the legislation of the first two or three centuries at  all. Its object mainly was political, that is, to enforce Saxon law  from Norman kings. No change was made, nothing new was added. There  was, however, a little early Saxon legislation before the Conquest.  The best compilation is contained in Stubbs's \"Selected Charters.\" He  says that the earliest English written laws contained amendments of  older unwritten customs, or qualifications of those customs, when they  were gradually wearing out of popular recollection. Such documents are  generally obscure. They require for their elucidation a knowledge  of the customs they were intended to amend. That is as I told you:  everybody was supposed to know the law, and early written statutes  were either mere compilations of already existing law, slight  modifications of them, or else in the nature of imposing various  penalties--all of which assume that you know the law already. When  they attempted codification, which they did about twice before the  Conquest (especially under Edward the Confessor, for that reason he is  called the Father of English law, the English Justinian, because he  was enough of a civilian to understand what a code was), King Edward  made the attempt to get a certain amount of law written out; but even  that would be very unintelligible if you tried to read it, for he  assumed that one knew it all already, and it also is mainly in the  nature of imposing penalties, not stating the law as it was. However,  that is called the first English code. All the Saxon laws Dr. Stubbs  could find fill only twenty-two pages of his small book; and he says  that English law, from its first to its latest phase, has never  possessed an authoritative, constructive, systematic, or approximately  exhaustive statement, such as was attempted by the great founders of  the civil or Continental law, by Justinian or by Napoleon Bonaparte.  Now this is true, even to-day, of our English and our American law.  That is, the great bulk of the law that is administered in our courts  is not \"written,\" it is not in any code. There are, of course,  text-books on the subject, but they are of no binding authority. It  resides in the learning of the judges. It is what is called court-made  law--\"_jus dicere_,\" not \"_jus dare_.\" Our judges are still supposed  to tell what the law is, and they sometimes, as the common law is a  very elastic thing, have to make new law. That is, if the precise case  isn't covered by any previous decision or by any statute, the judge  or the court will say what the common law ought to be when applied  to that state of facts. So our law is a continually growing law, and  largely made still in the old Saxon way, by custom and the judges, and  still under the theory that the common law is an existing thing; that  the law exists and the judge only expounds. We have never lost sight  of that theory.    These early Anglo-Saxon laws mostly concern only matters of procedure  for the courts, or the scale of punishment. As they assume a knowledge  of existing law, they are often hard to understand. Here are some of  the laws of Wessex:        A.D. 690. WESSEX KING INI.        CAP. 11. \"If any one sell his own countryman, bond or free, though      he be guilty, over sea, let him pay for him according to his      'wer.'\"    As to \"wer.\" Now there were slaves in England in those days; at the  time of the Conquest the Domesday Book reports twenty-five thousand.  _Slaves_, I mean; not the unfree agricultural laborers, they were in a  higher class, but the regularly bound _slaves_, who were descendants,  either of the early British inhabitants or of the Saxons themselves,  who had been punished in the courts and had been sentenced into  slavery, or men who had voluntarily sold themselves into slavery. For  under early Saxon law a man could sell his child into slavery if the  child were under seven years old, and above fourteen the child could  sell himself. This refers, of course, to that; it is really a kind of  predecessor of our Thirteenth Amendment; that is, it forbids slavery;  it forbids making new slaves. The word \"wer\" is the word we have in  \"wer-wolf,\" meaning blood; for instance, \"weregild\" is a man's blood  money. Every man had a price from the king down; if a man killed the  king he had to pay, we will say, fifty thousand pounds; if a thane,  it might be one or two thousand; if an ordinary freeman, one hundred  pounds, and so on.        CAP. 36. \"Let him who takes a thief, or to whom one taken is      given, and he then lets him go, or conceals the theft, pay for      the thief according to his 'wer.' If he be an ealdorman, let him      forfeit his shire, unless the king is willing to be merciful to      him.\"    Now the earliest direct legislation about personal property in a  statute is as late as 1100; but this early Saxon law was a recognition  of personal property, because a man cannot steal a thing unless there  is property. This section, therefore, implies property in personalty;  because a man cannot steal land; but it never occurred to them to pass  a law saying that there _shall be_ private property, because that was  the unwritten law that they were all supposed to know.        A.D. 890. WESSEX. ALFRED.        CAP. 27. \"If a man, kinless of paternal relatives, fight and slay      a man, and then if he have maternal relatives, let them pay a      third of the 'wer'; his guild-brethren a third part; for a      third let him flee. If he have no maternal relatives, let his      guild-brethren pay half, for half let him flee.\"        CAP. 28. \"If a man kill a man thus circumstanced, if he have      no relatives, let half be paid to the king, half to his      guild-brethren.\"    It is very hard for us to understand what that means. One would  infer that the weregild was only paid by a man with relatives on his  father's side. It doesn't say that, but that is the inference. We  shall have plenty to say about the guilds later--the historical  predecessors of the modern trades-unions. We here find the word  _guild_ recognized and spoken of in the law as early as 890.        A.D. 920. WESSEX. EDWARD.        \"2. And if a ceorl throve, so that had fully five hides of his      own land, church and kitchen, bell-house and burh-gate-seat,      and special duty in the king's hall, then was he thenceforth of      thegn-right worthy.        \"6."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12238"],[0,"Science in the Kitchen (#5)"],[1,"coffee No. 4          Mrs. T's caramel coffee          Parched grain coffee          Wheat, oats, and barley coffee        _Recipes for cold beverages:_          Blackberry beverage          Fruit beverage          Fruit beverage No. 2          Fruit cordial          Grape beverage          Lemonade          Mixed lemonade          Oatmeal drink          Orangeade          Pineapple beverage          Pineapple lemonade          Pink lemonade          Sherbet          Tisane        Table topics.
