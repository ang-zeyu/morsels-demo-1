Apart from the more      general evils of work during pregnancy, Pinard found that during      the later months it had a tendency to press the uterus down into      the pelvis, and so cause the premature birth of undeveloped      children, while labor was rendered more difficult and dangerous      (see, e.g., Pinard, _Gazette des Hopitaux_, Nov. 28, 1895, Id.,      _Annales de Gynecologie_, Aug., 1898).        Letourneux has studied the question whether repose during      pregnancy is necessary for women whose professional work is only      slightly fatiguing. He investigated 732 successive confinements      at the Clinique Baudelocque in Paris. He found that 137 women      engaged in fatiguing occupations (servants, cooks, etc.) and not      resting during pregnancy, produced children with an average      weight of 3,081 grammes; 115 women engaged in only slightly      fatiguing occupations (dressmakers, milliners, etc.) and also not      resting during pregnancy, had children with an average weight of      3,130 grammes, a slight but significant difference, in view of      the fact that the women of the first group were large and robust,      while those of the second group were of slight and elegant build.      Again, comparing groups of women who rested during pregnancy, it      was found that the women accustomed to fatiguing work had      children with an average weight of 3,319 grammes, while those      accustomed to less fatiguing work had children with an average      weight of 3,318 grammes. The difference between repose and      non-repose is thus considerable, while it also enables robust      women exercising a fatiguing occupation to catch up, though not      to surpass, the frailer women exercising a less fatiguing      occupation. We see, too, that even in the comparatively      unfatiguing occupations of milliners, etc., rest during pregnancy      still remains important, and cannot safely be dispensed with.      \"Society,\" Letourneux concludes, \"must guarantee rest to women      not well off during a part of pregnancy. It will be repaid the      cost of doing so by the increased vigor of the children thus      produced\" (Letourneux, _De l'Influence de la Profession de la      Mere sur le Poids de l'Enfant_, These de Paris, 1897).        Dr. Dweira-Bernson (_Revue Pratique d'Obstetrique et de      Pediatrie_, 1903, p. 370), compared four groups of pregnant women      (servants with light work, servants with heavy work, farm girls,      dressmakers) who rested for three months before confinement with      four groups similarly composed who took no rest before      confinement. In every group he found that the difference in the      average weight of the child was markedly in favor of the women      who rested, and it was notable that the greatest difference was      found in the case of the farm girls who were probably the most      robust and also the hardest worked.        The usual time of gestation ranges between 274 and 280 days (or      280 to 290 days from the last menstrual period), and occasionally      a few days longer, though there is dispute as to the length of      the extreme limit, which some authorities would extend to 300      days, or even to 320 days (Pinard, in Richet's _Dictionnaire de      Physiologie_, vol. vii, pp. 150-162; Taylor, _Medical      Jurisprudence_, fifth edition, pp. 44, 98 et seq.; L.M. Allen,      \"Prolonged Gestation,\" _American Journal Obstetrics_, April,      1907). It is possible, as Mueller suggested in 1898 in a These de      Nancy, that civilization tends to shorten the period of      gestation, and that in earlier ages it was longer than it is now.      Such a tendency to premature birth under the exciting nervous      influences of civilization would thus correspond, as Bouchacourt      has pointed out (_La Grossesse_, p. 113), to the similar effect      of domestication in animals. The robust countrywoman becomes      transformed into the more graceful, but also more fragile, town      woman who needs a degree of care and hygiene which the      countrywoman with her more resistant nervous system can to some      extent dispense with, although even she, as we see, suffers in      the person of her child, and probably in her own person, from the      effects of work during pregnancy. The serious nature of this      civilized tendency to premature birth--of which lack of rest in      pregnancy is, however, only one of several important causes--is      shown by the fact that Seropian (_Frequence Comparee des Causes      de l'Accouchement Premature_, These de Paris, 1907) found that      about one-third of French births (32.28 per cent.) are to a      greater or less extent premature. Pregnancy is not a morbid      condition; on the contrary, a pregnant woman is at the climax of      her most normal physiological life, but owing to the tension thus      involved she is specially liable to suffer from any slight shock      or strain.        It must be remarked that the increased tendency to premature      birth, while in part it may be due to general tendencies of      civilization, is also in part due to very definite and      preventable causes. Syphilis, alcoholism, and attempts to produce      abortion are among the not uncommon causes of premature birth      (see, e.g., G.F. McCleary, \"The Influence of Antenatal Conditions      on Infantile Mortality,\" _British Medical Journal_, Aug. 13,      1904).        Premature birth ought to be avoided, because the child born too      early is insufficiently equipped for the task before him.      Astengo, dealing with nearly 19,000 cases at the Lariboisiere      Hospital in Paris and the Maternite, found, that reckoning from      the date of the last menstruation, there is a direct relation      between the weight of the infant at birth and the length of the      pregnancy. The longer the pregnancy, the finer the child      (Astengo, _Rapport du Poids des Enfants a la Duree de la      Grossesse_, These de Paris, 1905).        The frequency of premature birth is probably as great in England      as in France. Ballantyne states (_Manual of Antenatal Pathology;      The Foetus_, p. 456) that for practical purposes the frequency      of premature labors in maternity hospitals may be put at 20 per      cent., but that if all infants weighing less than 3,000 grammes      are to be regarded as premature, it rises to 41.5 per cent. That      premature birth is increasing in England seems to be indicated by      the fact that during the past twenty-five years there has been a      steady rise in the mortality rate from premature birth. McCleary,      who discusses this point and considers the increase real,      concludes that \"it would appear that there has been a diminution      in the quality as well as in the quantity of our output of      babies\" (see also a discussion, introduced by Dawson Williams, on      \"Physical Deterioration,\" _British Medical Journal_, Oct. 14,      1905).        It need scarcely be pointed out that not only is immaturity a      cause of deterioration in the infants that survive, but that it      alone serves enormously to decrease the number of infants that      are able to survive. Thus G. Newman states (loc. cit.) that in      most large English urban districts immaturity is the chief cause      of infant mortality, furnishing about 30 per cent. of the infant      deaths; even in London (Islington) Alfred Harris (_British      Medical Journal_, Dec. 14, 1907) finds that it is responsible for      nearly 17 per cent. of the infantile deaths. It is estimated by      Newman that about half of the mothers of infants dying of      immaturity suffer from marked ill-health and poor physique; they      are not, therefore, fitted to be mothers.        Rest during pregnancy is a very powerful agent in preventing      premature birth. Thus Dr. Sarraute-Lourie has compared 1,550      pregnant women at the Asile Michelet who rested before      confinement with 1,550 women confined at the Hopital Lariboisiere      who had enjoyed no such period of rest. She found that the      average duration of pregnancy was at least twenty days shorter in      the latter group (Mme. Sarraute-Lourie, _De l'Influence du Repos      sur la Duree de la Gestation_, These de Paris, 1899).        Leyboff has insisted on the absolute necessity of rest during      pregnancy, as well for the sake of the woman herself as the      burden she carries, and shows the evil results which follow when      rest is neglected. Railway traveling, horse-riding, bicycling,      and sea-voyages are also, Leyboff believes, liable to be      injurious to the course of pregnancy. Leyboff recognizes the      difficulties which procreating women are placed under by present      industrial conditions, and concludes that \"it is urgently      necessary to prevent women, by law, from working during the last      three months of pregnancy; that in every district there should be      a maternity fund; that during this enforced rest a woman should      receive the same salary as during work.\" He adds that the      children of unmarried mothers should be cared for by the State,      that there should be an eight-hours' day for all workers, and      that no children under sixteen should be allowed to work (E.      Leyboff, _L'Hygiene de la Grossesse_, These de Paris, 1905).        Perruc states that at least two months' rest before confinement      should be made compulsory, and that during this period the woman      should receive an indemnity regulated by the State. He is of      opinion that it should take the form of compulsory assurance, to      which the worker, the employer, and the State alike contributed      (Perruc, _Assistance aux Femmes Enceintes_, These de Paris,      1905).        It is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#5)"],[1,"Norman nave, as originally designed, was  approaching completion, the designers determined upon an extension of  the nave, and a much grander western finish to the church than had  before been contemplated. This idea included a dignified western  transept, the dimensions of which, from north to south, should exceed  the entire width of the nave and aisles. This would of necessity involve  the lengthening of the nave, because the monastic buildings came close  to the south aisle of the nave, at the point where the original  termination of the church was to have been, as may be seen by the old  western wall of the cloister, which is still standing.    The two next abbots were Andrew (1193-1200), and Acharius (1200-1210).  To one or both of these may be assigned the western transept. By their  time the Norman style was giving place to the lighter and more elegant  architecture of the Early English period, the round arch was beginning  to be superseded by the pointed arch, and the massive ornamentation  which marks the earlier style was displaced by the conventional foliage  that soon came to be very generally employed. Most wisely, however, the  Peterborough builders made their work at the west end of the nave  intentionally uniform with what was already built. Very numerous  indications of this can be seen by careful observers. The bases of the  western pillars, the change in the depth of the mouldings,  characteristic changes in the capitals in the triforium range, and  especially the grand arches below the transept towers, which are  pointed, but enriched with ornamentation of pronounced Norman character,  all point to the later date of this western transept.    At the west wall of the church all trace of Norman work disappears. The  arcade near the ground, the large round arch above the door, the great  west window and its adjacent arches (not, of course, including the late  tracery), are all of distinct Early English character. The whole of this  wall may be held to be an integral part of the west front, and not of  the transept which it bounds.    When we come to the most distinctive feature of the cathedral, the  glorious west front, we find we have no help whatever from the  chronicles. Nowhere is there the smallest reference to its building.  Other works raised by the Abbots of the period are named, but the noble  western portico is never once mentioned. Perhaps the rapid succession of  abbots after Acharius may account for this. The building must have  taken some years, and the credit of the whole cannot be given to one.  There were four Abbots after Acharius before the church was dedicated.  They were Robert of Lindsey (1214-1222), Alexander (1222-1226), Martin  of Ramsey (1226-1233), and Walter of S. Edmunds (1233-1245). During the  abbacy of this last the church was dedicated on the 4th of October 1237,  (according to the _Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense_), or on the 28th of  September 1238, according to Matthew Paris. The Bishop of Lincoln,  Robert Grostete, took the chief part in the ceremony, assisted by  William Brewer, Bishop of Exeter. The other chronicle calls the second  bishop suffragan of the Bishop of Lincoln, which may mean no more than  that he assisted on the occasion. The dedication took place in  accordance with the provisions of certain constitutions which had been  drawn up at a council held in London. No doubt the building had before  this been completed. This date agrees well with the period which all  architectural experts accept as the probable date of the erection of the  west front. It may have been, and probably was, finished some few years  before the dedication. The very fine gables at the north and south ends  of the western transept are of the same date as the west front.    Considerable changes in the fabric, as well as additional buildings,  belong to the latter part of the thirteenth century. The documents  mention two of these. In the time of Richard of London (1274-1295), but  before his election to the abbacy, while he was still sacrist, the  bell-tower was erected, in which were hung the great bells which were  called Les Londreis, because he was himself a Londoner, and had caused  them to be brought from London. A previous abbot, John of Calais  (1249-1262), had contributed a great bell to the monastery, which he had  dedicated to S. Oswald. On it was inscribed the rhyming hexameter _Jon  de Caux abbas Oswaldo consecrat hoc vas_. The other great work of this  period was a magnificent Lady Chapel, since destroyed, begun in 1272 by  William Parys, then Prior, who laid the first stone with his own hand,  and placed beneath it some writings from the gospels. He lived to see it  completed, and at last his body was interred within it. Its altar was  consecrated in 1290, as is recorded in the register of Bishop Oliver  Sutton. It is described as having been built of stone and wood, with a  leaden roof, and with glass windows. There was a statue of the Virgin,  and round the walls, or perhaps in the stained glass in the windows,  there were figures of those named in the genealogy, with a compendium of  their lives beneath each. The Prior contributed five pounds of silver  and upwards of his annual revenues towards the decoration of this  chapel. From an engraving in Gunton's History, which may be taken as  fairly representing its appearance, for it was standing in his time,  although the drawing is manifestly inaccurate and must have been  sketched from memory, we gather that the windows were of the same  character as four which are still to be seen, three of them in the  eastern chapels of the south transept, and the fourth on the north side,  near the site of the Lady Chapel. These are all of excellent geometric  work, and precisely of the date given. This chapel was built, as at Ely,  to the east of the north transept. The position of the roof can be  traced on the east wall of the transept; and it can be there seen how  the Norman triforium windows were originally arranged. These being  covered by the Lady Chapel, had not been altered like those in other  parts of the church.    Other works of this century, not mentioned in the annals, are the entire  removal of the lower stage of Norman windows in the aisles, these were  replaced by wide windows of five lights each; the addition of a parapet  to the apse; the erection of piscinas and other accompaniments to side  altars, at the east ends of the choir aisles.    For the rest of the architectural history we have no chronicles to guide  us, and are left to the stones themselves. But there is very little  difficulty in fixing at least approximate dates for all the later work.  The most important alteration in the fourteenth century was the removal  of the stages above the four great arches of the central tower, and the  substitution of a lighter lantern. When this was done, the great round  arches east and west of the tower were changed into pointed arches, but  those north and south were left unaltered. There is every probability  that some signs of insecurity had made themselves evident. We have seen  that three stages of the Norman tower were erected by Abbot William of  Waterville. Though not so stated we infer from this that at least one  more stage was afterwards added. In any case the tower must have been a  very massive structure, considerably higher than the present one. In the  early part of this century, in 1321, the great tower of Ely had fallen;  and its fate may have warned the monks of Peterborough to see that the  disaster was not repeated here. This alteration must have been made,  judging by the details of the architecture, in the second quarter of the  century. Above the lantern was a wooden octagon. The views that are  given of this hardly warrant the admiration that has been sometimes  expressed, or the regrets that have been uttered at its removal. It may  have been designed to carry a wooden spire, such as was afterwards  erected on the bell-tower. But most will agree with the criticism that  it was \"a low and unsightly structure.\" It hardly rose more than eight  or ten feet above the top of the lantern, and the whole height of the  central tower, including the octagon, was less than the height of the  south-western spire of the front.    To this century belongs the transformation of the triforium windows all  through the nave and choir. Parapets were at the same time added above  the Norman corbel tables. The change effected in the apse was the most  noticeable; not only were the two upper tiers of Norman windows replaced  by Decorated ones of larger size, but the three lowest ones in the  centre were altogether removed, and their place taken by lofty archways,  when the new building was built. But we can judge of their appearance  from the two side windows which still remain; these, being not now  external, have had all the glass removed; but the mullions and tracery  are perfect, and even the iron-bars across are still there. At the inner  surface of the wall the five lower windows have very good hanging  tracery, of different designs.    The south-western spire of the west front is also of this period,  probably a little earlier in date than the lantern. This is of very  remarkable beauty, and very much more elegant than the corresponding  spire to the north. The triangular section of the pinnacles at the base  of the spire, the crockets with which they are enriched, and the open  canopies around, combine to produce a most graceful feature. To the  latter years of this century may be assigned the central porch, with  room above, inserted between the two middle piers of the west front.  Some regard this as a blemish; others as a distinct improvement. One  party maintains[13] that it is \"an unsightly encumbrance, in its present  position, seeing that it violates the uniformity of design displayed in  the west front\"; the other party contends[14] that it is \"an extremely  judicious insertion, "]]]
