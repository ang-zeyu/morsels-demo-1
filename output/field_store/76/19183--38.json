Note  the position of the lowest point of the curve of the meniscus,  estimating the tenths of the small divisions, thus reading its  position to hundredths of a cubic centimeter.    [Note 1: The ends of the colored paper used as an aid to accurate  readings may be fastened together by means of a gummed label. The  paper may then remain on the burette and be ready for immediate use by  sliding it up or down, as required.]    [Note 2: To obtain an accurate reading the eye must be very nearly on  a level with the meniscus. This is secured by the use of the paper  as described. The student should observe by trial how a reading is  affected when the meniscus is viewed from above or below.    The eye soon becomes accustomed to estimating the tenths of the  divisions. If the paper is held as directed, two divisions below the  meniscus, one whole division is visible to correct the judgment. It is  not well to attempt to bring the meniscus exactly to a division mark  on the burette. Such readings are usually less accurate than those in  which the tenths of a division are estimated.]      CALIBRATION OF GLASS MEASURING DEVICES    If accuracy of results is to be attained, the correctness of all  measuring instruments must be tested. None of the apparatus offered  for sale can be implicitly relied upon except those more expensive  instruments which are accompanied by a certificate from the !National  Bureau of Standards! at Washington, or other equally authentic source.    The bore of burettes is subject to accidental variations, and since  the graduations are applied by machine without regard to such  variations of bore, local errors result.    The process of testing these instruments is called !calibration!.  It is usually accomplished by comparing the actual weight of water  contained in the instrument with its apparent volume.    There is, unfortunately, no uniform standard of volume which has been  adopted for general use in all laboratories. It has been variously  proposed to consider the volume of 1000 grams of water at 4 deg., 15.5 deg.,  16 deg., 17.5 deg., and even 20 deg.C., as a liter for practical purposes, and to  consider the cubic centimeter to be one one-thousandth of that volume.  The true liter is the volume of 1000 grams of water at 4 deg.C.; but  this is obviously a lower temperature than that commonly found in  laboratories, and involves the constant use of corrections if taken as  a laboratory standard. Many laboratories use 15.5 deg.C. (60 deg. F.) as the  working standard. It is plain that any temperature which is deemed  most convenient might be chosen for a particular laboratory, but it  cannot be too strongly emphasized that all measuring instruments,  including burettes, pipettes, and flasks, should be calibrated at that  temperature in order that the contents of each burette, pipette,  etc., shall be comparable with that of every other instrument, thus  permitting general interchange and substitution. For example, it is  obvious that if it is desired to remove exactly 50 cc. from a solution  which has been diluted to 500 cc. in a graduated flask, the 50 cc.  flask or pipette used to remove the fractional portion must give  a correct reading at the same temperature as the 500 cc. flask.  Similarly, a burette used for the titration of the 50 cc. of solution  removed should be calibrated under the same conditions as the  measuring flasks or pipettes employed with it.    The student should also keep constantly in mind the fact that all  volumetric operations, to be exact, should be carried out as nearly at  a constant temperature as is practicable. The spot selected for  such work should therefore be subject to a minimum of temperature  variations, and should have as nearly the average temperature of  the laboratory as is possible. In all work, whether of calibration,  standardization, or analysis, the temperature of the liquids employed  must be taken into account, and if the temperature of these liquids  varies more than 3 deg. or 4 deg. from the standard temperature chosen for the  laboratory, corrections must be applied for errors due to expansion or  contraction, since volumes of a liquid measured at different times are  comparable only under like conditions as to temperature. Data to be  used for this purpose are given in the Appendix. Neglect of this  correction is frequently an avoidable source of error and annoyance in  otherwise excellent work. The temperature of all solutions at the time  of standardization should be recorded to facilitate the application of  temperature corrections, if such are necessary at any later time.      CALIBRATION OF THE BURETTES    Two burettes, one at least of which should have a glass stopper, are  required throughout the volumetric work. Both burettes should be  calibrated by the student to whom they are assigned.    PROCEDURE.--Weigh a 50 cc., flat-bottomed flask (preferably a  light-weight flask), which must be dry on the outside, to the nearest  centigram. Record the weight in the notebook. (See Appendix for  suggestions as to records.) Place the flask under the burette and draw  out into it about 10 cc. of water, removing any drop on the tip by  touching it against the inside of the neck of the flask. Do not  attempt to stop exactly at the 10 cc. mark, but do not vary more than  0.1 cc. from it. Note the time, and at the expiration of three minutes  (or longer) read the burette accurately, and record the reading in the  notebook (Note 1). Meanwhile weigh the flask and water to centigrams  and record its weight (Note 2). Draw off the liquid from 10 cc. to  about 20 cc. into the same flask without emptying it; weigh, and at  the expiration of three minutes take the reading, and so on throughout  the length of the burette. When it is completed, refill the burette  and check the first calibration.    The differences in readings represent the apparent volumes, the  differences in weights the true volumes. For example, if an apparent  volume of 10.05 cc. is found to weigh 10.03 grams, it may be assumed  with sufficient accuracy that the error in that 10 cc. amounts to  -0.02 cc., or -0.002 for each cubic centimeter (Note 3).    In the calculation of corrections the temperature of the water must be  taken into account, if this varies more than 4 deg.C. from the laboratory  standard temperature, consulting the table of densities of water in  the Appendix.    From the final data, plot the corrections to be applied so that they  may be easily read for each cubic centimeter throughout the burette.  The total correction at each 10 cc. may also be written on the burette  with a diamond, or etching ink, for permanence of record.    [Note 1: A small quantity of liquid at first adheres to the side of  even a clean burette. This slowly unites with the main body of liquid,  but requires an appreciable time. Three minutes is a sufficient  interval, but not too long, and should be adopted in every instance  throughout the whole volumetric practice before final readings are  recorded.]    [Note 2: A comparatively rough balance, capable of weighing to  centigrams, is sufficiently accurate for use in calibrations, for a  moment's reflection will show that it would be useless to weigh the  water with an accuracy greater than that of the readings taken on  the burette. The latter cannot exceed 0.01 cc. in accuracy, which  corresponds to 0.01 gram.    The student should clearly understand that !all other weighings!,  except those for calibration, should be made accurately to 0.0001  gram, unless special directions are given to the contrary.    Corrections for temperature variations of less than 4 deg.C. are  negligible, as they amount to less than 0.01 gram for each 10 grams of  water withdrawn.]    [Note 3: Should the error discovered in any interval of 10 cc. on the  burette exceed 0.10 cc., it is advisable to weigh small portions (even  1 cc.) to locate the position of the variation of bore in the  tube rather than to distribute the correction uniformly over the  corresponding 10 cc. The latter is the usual course for small  corrections, and it is convenient to calculate the correction  corresponding to each cubic centimeter and to record it in the form  of a table or calibration card, or to plot a curve representing the  values.    Burettes may also be calibrated by drawing off the liquid in  successive portions through a 5 cc. pipette which has been accurately  calibrated, as a substitute for weighing. If many burettes are to be  tested, this is a more rapid method.]      PIPETTES    A !pipette! may consist of a narrow tube, in the middle of which is  blown a bulb of a capacity a little less than that which it is desired  to measure by the pipette; or it may be a miniature burette, without  the stopcock or rubber tip at the lower extremity. In either case, the  flow of liquid is regulated by the pressure of the finger on the top,  which governs the admission of the air.    Pipettes are usually already graduated when purchased, but they  require calibration for accurate work.      CALIBRATION OF PIPETTES    PROCEDURE.--Clean the pipette. Draw distilled water into it by sucking  at the upper end until the water is well above the graduation mark.  Quickly place the forefinger over the top of the tube, thus preventing  the entrance of air and holding the water in the pipette. Cautiously  admit a little air by releasing the pressure of the finger, and allow  the level of the water to fall until the lowest point of the meniscus  is level with the graduation. Hold the water at that point by pressure  of the finger and then allow the water to run out from the pipette  into a small tared, or weighed, beaker or flask. After a definite time  interval, usually two to three minutes, touch the end of the pipette  against the side of the beaker or flask to remove any liquid adhering  to it (Note 1).
