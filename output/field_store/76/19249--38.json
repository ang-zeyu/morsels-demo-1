My creditors demand hard cash.'    \"'I'm very sorry,' I replied, 'but I can't help it.'    \"'Yes, you can,' said he, 'and I'll tell you how.' He then propounded a  scheme which I at first rejected with indignation, but which, when the  others backed him up, I at last allowed myself to be talked into, and  actually put into execution. I contrived, by taking advantage of the  carelessness of some of my superiors at the bank, to get possession of  some blank cheque forms, which I filled up with small amounts--not more  than two or three pounds--and signed with careful imitations of the  signatures of some of our clients. Jezzard got some stamps made for  stamping on the account numbers, and when this had been done I handed  over to him the whole collection of forged cheques in settlement of my  debts to all of my four companions.    \"The cheques were duly presented--by whom I do not know; and although,  to my dismay, the modest sums for which I had drawn them had been  skilfully altered into quite considerable amounts, they were all paid  without demur excepting one. That one, which had been altered from three  pounds to thirty-nine, was drawn upon an account which was already  slightly overdrawn. The cashier became suspicious; the cheque was  impounded, and the client communicated with. Then, of course, the mine  exploded. Not only was this particular forgery detected, but inquiries  were set afoot which soon brought to light the others. Presently  circumstances, which I need not describe, threw some suspicion on me. I  at once lost my nerve, and finally made a full confession.    \"The inevitable prosecution followed. It was not conducted vindictively.  Still, I had actually committed the forgeries, and though I endeavoured  to cast a part of the blame on to the shoulders of my treacherous  confederates, I did not succeed. Jezzard, it is true, was arrested, but  was discharged for lack of evidence, and, consequently, the whole burden  of the forgery fell upon me. The jury, of course, convicted me, and I  was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude.    \"During the time that I was in prison an uncle of mine died in Canada,  and by the provisions of his will I inherited the whole of his very  considerable property, so that when the time arrived for my release, I  came out of prison, not only free, but comparatively rich. I at once  dropped my own name, and, assuming that of Alfred Draper, began to look  about for some quiet spot in which I might spend the rest of my days in  peace, and with little chance of my identity being discovered. Such a  place I found in Sundersley, and here I have lived for the last seven  years, liked and respected, I think, by my neighbours, who have little  suspected that they were harbouring in their midst a convicted felon.    \"All this time I had neither seen nor heard anything of my four  confederates, and I hoped and believed that they had passed completely  out of my life. But they had not. Only a month ago I met them once more,  to my sorrow, and from the day of that meeting all the peace and  security of my quiet existence at Sundersley have vanished. Like evil  spirits they have stolen into my life, changing my happiness into bitter  misery, filling my days with dark forebodings and my nights with  terror.\"    Here Mr. Draper paused, and seemed to sink into a gloomy reverie.    \"Under what circumstances did you meet these men?\" Thorndyke asked.    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Draper, arousing with sudden excitement, \"the  circumstances were very singular and suspicious. I had gone over to  Eastwich for the day to do some shopping. About eleven o'clock in the  forenoon I was making some purchases in a shop when I noticed two men  looking in the window, or rather pretending to do so, whilst they  conversed earnestly. They were smartly dressed, in a horsy fashion, and  looked like well-to-do farmers, as they might very naturally have been  since it was market-day. But it seemed to me that their faces were  familiar to me. I looked at them more attentively, and then it suddenly  dawned upon me, most unpleasantly, that they resembled Leach and  Jezzard. And yet they were not quite like. The resemblance was there,  but the differences were greater than the lapse of time would account  for. Moreover, the man who resembled Jezzard had a rather large mole on  the left cheek just under the eye, while the other man had an eyeglass  stuck in one eye, and wore a waxed moustache, whereas Leach had always  been clean-shaven, and had never used an eyeglass.    \"As I was speculating upon the resemblance they looked up, and caught my  intent and inquisitive eye, whereupon they moved away from the window;  and when, having completed my purchases, I came out into the street,  they were nowhere to be seen.    \"That evening, as I was walking by the river outside the town before  returning to the station, I overtook a yacht which was being towed  down-stream. Three men were walking ahead on the bank with a long  tow-line, and one man stood in the cockpit steering. As I approached,  and was reading the name _Otter_ on the stern, the man at the helm  looked round, and with a start of surprise I recognized my old  acquaintance Hearn. The recognition, however, was not mutual, for I had  grown a beard in the interval, and I passed on without appearing to  notice him; but when I overtook the other three men, and recognized, as  I had feared, the other three members of the gang, I must have looked  rather hard at Jezzard, for he suddenly halted, and exclaimed: 'Why,  it's our old friend Ted! Our long-lost and lamented brother!' He held  out his hand with effusive cordiality, and began to make inquiries as to  my welfare; but I cut him short with the remark that I was not proposing  to renew the acquaintance, and, turning off on to a footpath that led  away from the river, strode off without looking back.    \"Naturally this meeting exercised my mind a good deal, and when I  thought of the two men whom I had seen in the town, I could hardly  believe that their likeness to my quondam friends was a mere  coincidence. And yet when I had met Leach and Jezzard by the river, I  had found them little altered, and had particularly noticed that  Jezzard had no mole on his face, and that Leach was clean-shaven as of  old.    \"But a day or two later all my doubts were resolved by a paragraph in  the local paper. It appeared that on the day of my visit to Eastwich a  number of forged cheques had been cashed at the three banks. They had  been presented by three well-dressed, horsy-looking men who looked like  well-to-do farmers. One of them had a mole on the left cheek, another  was distinguished by a waxed moustache and a single eyeglass, while the  description of the third I did not recognize. None of the cheques had  been drawn for large amounts, though the total sum obtained by the  forgers was nearly four hundred pounds; but the most interesting point  was that the cheque-forms had been manufactured by photographic process,  and the water-mark skilfully, though not quite perfectly, imitated.  Evidently the swindlers were clever and careful men, and willing to take  a good deal of trouble for the sake of security, and the result of their  precautions was that the police could make no guess as to their  identity.    \"The very next day, happening to walk over to Port Marston, I came upon  the _Otter_ lying moored alongside the quay in the harbour. As soon as I  recognized the yacht, I turned quickly and walked away, but a minute  later I ran into Leach and Jezzard, who were returning to their craft.  Jezzard greeted me with an air of surprise. 'What! Still hanging about  here, Ted?' he exclaimed. 'That is not discreet of you, dear boy. I  should earnestly advise you to clear out.'    \"'What do you mean?' I asked.    \"'Tut, tut!' said he. 'We read the papers like other people, and we know  now what business took you to Eastwich. But it's foolish of you to hang  about the neighbourhood where you might be spotted at any moment.'    \"The implied accusation took me aback so completely that I stood staring  at him in speechless astonishment, and at that unlucky moment a  tradesman, from whom I had ordered some house-linen, passed along the  quay. Seeing me, he stopped and touched his hat.    \"'Beg pardon, Mr. Draper,' said he, 'but I shall be sending my cart up  to Sundersley to-morrow morning if that will do for you.'    \"I said that it would, and as the man turned away, Jezzard's face broke  out into a cunning smile.    \"So you are Mr. Draper, of Sundersley, now, are you?' said he. 'Well, I  hope you won't be too proud to come and look in on your old friends. We  shall be staying here for some time.'    \"That same night Hearn made his appearance at my house. He had come as  an emissary from the gang, to ask me to do some work for them--to  execute some forgeries, in fact. Of course I refused, and pretty  bluntly, too, whereupon Hearn began to throw out vague hints as to what  might happen if I made enemies of the gang, and to utter veiled, but  quite intelligible, threats. You will say that I was an idiot not to  send him packing, and threaten to hand over the whole gang to the  police; but I was never a man of strong nerve, and I don't mind  admitting that I was mortally afraid of that cunning devil, Jezzard.    \"The next thing that happened was that Hearn came and took lodgings in  Sundersley, and, in spite of my efforts to avoid him, he haunted me  continually. The yacht, too, had evidently settled down for some time at  a berth in the harbour, for I heard that a local smack-boy had been  engaged as a deck-hand; and I frequently encountered Jezzard and the  other members of the gang, who all professed to believe that I had  committed the Eastwich forgeries. One day I was foolish enough to allow  myself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#5)"],[1," it was for no mean object, for  no mere private selfishness or vanity, that he endured all this. He  strove hard to be a great man and a rich man. But it was that he might  have his hands free and strong and well furnished to carry forward the  double task of overthrowing ignorance and building up the new and solid  knowledge on which his heart was set--that immense conquest of nature on  behalf of man which he believed to be possible, and of which he believed  himself to have the key.    The letter to Lord Burghley did not help him much. He received the  reversion of a place, the Clerkship of the Council, which did not become  vacant for twenty years. But these years of service declined and place  withheld were busy and useful ones. What he was most intent upon, and  what occupied his deepest and most serious thought, was unknown to the  world round him, and probably not very intelligible to his few intimate  friends, such as his brother Antony and Dr. Andrewes. Meanwhile he  placed his pen at the disposal of the authorities, and though they  regarded him more as a man of study than of practice and experience,  they were glad to make use of it. His versatile genius found another  employment. Besides his affluence in topics, he had the liveliest fancy  and most active imagination. But that he wanted the sense of poetic  fitness and melody, he might almost be supposed, with his reach and play  of thought, to have been capable, as is maintained in some eccentric  modern theories, of writing Shakespeare's plays. No man ever had a more  imaginative power of illustration drawn from the most remote and most  unlikely analogies; analogies often of the quaintest and most unexpected  kind, but often also not only felicitous in application but profound and  true. His powers were early called upon for some of those sportive  compositions in which that age delighted on occasions of rejoicing or  festival. Three of his contributions to these \"devices\" have been  preserved--two of them composed in honour of the Queen, as \"triumphs,\"  offered by Lord Essex, one probably in 1592 and another in 1595; a  third for a Gray's Inn revel in 1594. The \"devices\" themselves were of  the common type of the time, extravagant, odd, full of awkward allegory  and absurd flattery, and running to a prolixity which must make modern  lovers of amusement wonder at the patience of those days; but the  \"discourses\" furnished by Bacon are full of fine observation and  brilliant thought and wit and happy illustration, which, fantastic as  the general conception is, raises them far above the level of such  fugitive trifles.    Among the fragmentary papers belonging to this time which have come  down, not the least curious are those which throw light on his manner of  working. While he was following out the great ideas which were to be the  basis of his philosophy, he was as busy and as painstaking in fashioning  the instruments by which they were to be expressed; and in these papers  we have the records and specimens of this preparation. He was a great  collector of sentences, proverbs, quotations, sayings, illustrations,  anecdotes, and he seems to have read sometimes simply to gather phrases  and apt words. He jots down at random any good and pointed remark which  comes into his thought or his memory; at another time he groups a set of  stock quotations with a special drift, bearing on some subject, such as  the faults of universities or the habits of lawyers. Nothing is too  minute for his notice. He brings together in great profusion mere forms,  varied turns of expression, heads and tails of clauses and paragraphs,  transitions, connections; he notes down fashions of compliment, of  excuse or repartee, even morning and evening salutations; he records  neat and convenient opening and concluding sentences, ways of speaking  more adapted than others to give a special colour or direction to what  the speaker or writer has to say--all that hook-and-eye work which seems  so trivial and passes so unnoticed as a matter of course, and which yet  is often hard to reach, and which makes all the difference between  tameness and liveliness, between clearness and obscurity--all the  difference, not merely to the ease and naturalness, but often to the  logical force of speech. These collections it was his way to sift and  transcribe again and again, adding as well as omitting. From one of  these, belonging to 1594 and the following years, the _Promus of  Formularies and Elegancies_, Mr. Spedding has given curious extracts;  and the whole collection has been recently edited by Mrs. Henry Pott.  Thus it was that he prepared himself for what, as we read it, or as his  audience heard it, seems the suggestion or recollection of the moment.  Bacon was always much more careful of the value or aptness of a thought  than of its appearing new and original. Of all great writers he least  minds repeating himself, perhaps in the very same words; so that a  simile, an illustration, a quotation pleases him, he returns to it--he  is never tired of it; it obviously gives him satisfaction to introduce  it again and again. These collections of odds and ends illustrate  another point in his literary habits. His was a mind keenly sensitive to  all analogies and affinities, impatient of a strict and rigid logical  groove, but spreading as it were tentacles on all sides in quest of  chance prey, and quickened into a whole system of imagination by the  electric quiver imparted by a single word, at once the key and symbol of  the thinking it had led to. And so he puts down word or phrase, so  enigmatical to us who see it by itself, which to him would wake up a  whole train of ideas, as he remembered the occasion of it--how at a  certain time and place this word set the whole moving, seemed to  breathe new life and shed new light, and has remained the token,  meaningless in itself, which reminds him of so much.    When we come to read his letters, his speeches, his works, we come  continually on the results and proofs of this early labour. Some of the  most memorable and familiar passages of his writings are to be traced  from the storehouses which he filled in these years of preparation. An  example of this correspondence between the note-book and the composition  is to be seen in a paper belonging to this period, written apparently to  form part of a masque, or as he himself calls it, a \"Conference of  Pleasure,\" and entitled the _Praise of Knowledge_. It is interesting  because it is the first draught which we have from him of some of the  leading ideas and most characteristic language about the defects and the  improvement of knowledge, which were afterwards embodied in the  _Advancement_ and the _Novum Organum_. The whole spirit and aim of his  great reform is summed up in the following fine passage:         \"Facility to believe, impatience to doubt, temerity to assever,       glory to know, doubt to contradict, end to gain, sloth to search,       seeking things in words, resting in a part of nature--these and the       like have been the things which have forbidden the happy match       between the mind of man and the nature of things, and in place       thereof have married it to vain notions and blind experiments....       Therefore, no doubt, the _sovereignty of man_ lieth hid in       knowledge; wherein many things are reserved which kings with their       treasures cannot buy nor with their force command; their spials and       intelligencers can give no news of them; their seamen and       discoverers cannot sail where they grow. Now we govern nature in       opinions, but we are thrall unto her in necessity; but if we could       be led by her in invention, we should command her in action.\"    To the same occasion as the discourse on the _Praise of Knowledge_  belongs, also, one in _Praise of the Queen_. As one is an early specimen  of his manner of writing on philosophy, so this is a specimen of what  was equally characteristic of him--his political and historical writing.  It is, in form, necessarily a panegyric, as high-flown and adulatory as  such performances in those days were bound to be. But it is not only  flattery. It fixes with true discrimination on the points in Elizabeth's  character and reign which were really subjects of admiration and homage.  Thus of her unquailing spirit at the time of the Spanish invasion--         \"Lastly, see a Queen, that when her realm was to have been invaded       by an army, the preparation whereof was like the travail of an       elephant, the provisions infinite, the setting forth whereof was       the terror and wonder of Europe; it was not seen that her cheer,       her fashion, her ordinary manner was anything altered; not a cloud       of that storm did appear in that countenance wherein peace doth       ever shine; but with excellent assurance and advised security she       inspired her council, animated her nobility, redoubled the courage       of her people; still having this noble apprehension, not only that       she would communicate her fortune with them, but that it was she       that would protect them, and not they her; which she testified by       no less demonstration than her presence in camp. Therefore that       magnanimity that neither feareth greatness of alteration, nor the       vows of conspirators, nor the power of the enemy, is more than       heroical.\"    These papers, though he put his best workmanship into them, as he  invariably did with whatever he touched, were of an ornamental kind. But  he did more serious work. In the year 1592 a pamphlet had been published  on the Continent in Latin and English, _Responsio ad Edictum Reginae  Angliae_, with reference to the severe legislation which followed on the  Armada, making such charges against the Queen and the Government as it  was natural for the Roman Catholic party to make, and making them with  the utmost virulence and unscrupulousness. It was "]]]
