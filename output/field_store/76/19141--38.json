[Illustration: '\"Thou art betrayed.\"'----26]    The men-at-arms hurried up immediately, and striking the hands of the  fellow with the butts of their lances, made him let go the bridle.  As he  had the appearance of a poor madman, and nothing more, he was allowed to  go without any questioning, and he followed the king for nearly half an  hour, repeating the same cry from a distance.  The king was much troubled  at this sudden apparition; and his head, which was very weak, was quite  turned by it.  Nevertheless the march was continued.  When the forest had  been traversed, they came to a great sandy plain, where the rays of the  sun were more scorching than ever.  One of the king's pages, overcome by  the heat, had fallen asleep, and the lance he carried fell against his  helmet, and suddenly caused a loud clash of steel.    \"The king shuddered; and then he was observed, rising in his stirrups, to  draw his sword, touch his horse with the spur, and make a dash, crying,  'Forward upon these traitors!  They would deliver me up to the enemy!'  Every one moved hastily aside, but not before some were wounded; it is  even said that several were killed, among them a bastard of Polignac.  The king's brother, the Duke of Orleans, happened to be quite close by.  'Fly, my nephew d'Orleans,' shouted the Duke of Burgundy: 'my lord is  beside himself.  My God! let some one try and seize him!'  He was so  furious that none durst risk it; and he was left to gallop hither and  thither, and tire himself in pursuit of first one and then another.  At  last, when he was weary and bathed in sweat, his chamberlain, William de  Martel, came up behind and threw his arms about him.  He was surrounded,  had his sword taken from him, was lifted from his horse, and laid gently  on the ground, and then his jacket was unfastened.  His brother and his  uncles came up, but his eyes were fixed and recognized nobody, and he did  not utter a word.  'We must go back to Le Mans,' said the Dukes of Berry  and Burgundy: 'here is an end of the trip to Brittany.' On the way they  fell in with a wagon drawn by oxen; in this they laid the King of France,  having bound him for fear of a renewal of his frenzy, and so took him  back, motionless and speechless, to the town.\"    It was not a mere fit of delirious fever; it was the beginning of a  radical mental derangement, sometimes in abeyance, or at least for some  time alleviated, but bursting out again without appreciable reason, and  aggravated at every fresh explosion.  Charles VI. had always had a taste  for masquerading.  When in 1389 the young queen, Isabel of Bavaria, came  to Paris to be married, the king, on the morning of her entry, said to  his chamberlain, Sire de Savoisy, \"Prithee, take a good horse, and I will  mount behind thee; and we will dress so as not to be known and go to see  my wife cone in.\"  Savoisy did not like it, but the king insisted; and so  they went in this guise through the crowd, and got many a blow from the  officers' staves when they attempted to approach too near the procession.  In 1393, a year after his first outbreak of madness, the king, during an  entertainment at court, conceived the idea of disguising as savages  himself and five of his courtiers.  They had been sewn up in a linen skin  which defined their whole bodies; and this skin had been covered with a  resinous pitch, so as to hold sticking upon it a covering of tow, which  made them appear hairy from head to foot.  Thus disguised these savages  went dancing into the ball-room; one of those present took up a lighted  torch and went up to them; and in a moment several of them were in  flames.  It was impossible to get off the fantastic dresses clinging to  their bodies.  \"Save the king!\" shouted one of the poor masquers; but it  was not known which was the king.  The Duchess de Berry, his aunt,  recognized him, caught hold of him, and wrapped him in her robe, saying,  \"Do not move; you see your companions are burning.\"  And thus he was  saved amidst the terror of all present.  When he was conscious of his mad  state, he was horrified; he asked pardon for the injury he had done,  confessed and received the communion.  Later, when he perceived his  malady returning, he would allude to it with tears in his eyes, ask to  have his hunting-knife taken away, and say to those about him, \"If any of  you, by I know not what witchcraft, be guilty of my sufferings, I adjure  him, in the name of Jesus Christ, to torment me no more, and to put an  end to me forthwith without making me linger so.\"  He conceived a horror  of Queen Isabel, and, without recognizing her, would say when he saw her,  \"What woman is this?  What does she want?  Will she never cease her  importunities?  Save me from her persecution!\"  At first great care was  taken of him.  They sent for a skilful doctor from Laon, named William de  Harsely, who put him on a regimen from which, for some time, good effects  were experienced.  But the doctor was uncomfortable at court; he  preferred going back to his little place at Laon, where he soon  afterwards died; and eleven years later, in 1405, nobody took any more  trouble about the king.  He was fed like a dog, and allowed to fall  ravenously upon his food.  For five whole months he had not a change of  clothes.  At last some shame was felt for this neglect, and an attempt  was made to repair it.  It took a dozen men to overcome the madman's  resistance.  He was washed, shaved, and dressed in fresh clothes.  He  became more composed, and began once more to recognize certain persons,  amongst others, the former provost of Paris, Juvenal des Ursins, whose  visit appeared to give him pleasure, and to whom he said, without well  knowing why, \"Juvenal, let us not waste our time.\"  On his good days he  was sometimes brought in to sit at certain councils at which there was a  discussion about the diminution of taxes and relief of the people, and he  showed symptoms, at intervals, of taking an interest in them.  A fair  young Burgundian, Odette de Champdivers, was the only one amongst his  many favorites who was at all successful in soothing him during his  violent fits.  It was Duke John the Fearless, who had placed her near the  king, that she might promote his own influence, and she took advantage of  it to further her own fortunes, which, however, did not hinder her from  afterwards passing into the service of Charles VII. against the house of  Burgundy.    [Illustration: Charles VI. and Odette----71]    For thirty years, from 1392 to 1422, the crown remained on the head of  this poor madman, whilst France was a victim to the bloody quarrels of  the royal house, to national dismemberment, to licentiousness in morals,  to civil anarchy, and to foreign conquest.    When, for the first time, in the forest of Le Mans, the Dukes of Berry  and Burgundy saw their nephew in this condition, their first feeling was  one of sorrow and disquietude.  The Duke of Burgundy especially, who was  accessible to generous and sympathetic emotions, cried out with tears, as  he embraced the king, \"My lord and nephew, comfort me with just one  word!\"  But the desires and the hopes of selfish ambition reappeared  before long more prominently than these honest effusions of feeling.  \"All!\" said the Duke of Berry, \"De Clisson, La Mviere, Noviant, and  Vilaine have been haughty and harsh towards me; the time has come when  I shall pay them out in the same coin from the same mint.\"  The  guardianship of the king was withdrawn from his councillors, and  transferred to four chamberlains chosen by his uncles.  The two dukes,  however, did not immediately lay hands on the government of the kingdom;  the constable De Clisson and the late councillors of Charles V. remained  in charge of it for some time longer; they had given enduring proofs of  capacity and fidelity to the king's service; and the two dukes did not  at first openly attack them, but labored strenuously, nevertheless, to  destroy them.  The Duke of Burgundy one day said to Sire de Noviant,  \"I have been overtaken by a very pressing business, for which I require  forthwith thirty thousand crowns; let me have them out of my lord's  treasury; I will restore them at another time.\"  Noviant answered  respectfully that the council must be spoken to about it.  \"I wish none  to know of it,\" said the duke.  Noviant persisted.  \"You will not do me  this favor?\" rejoined the duke; \"you shall rue it before long.\"  It was  against the constable that the wrath of the princes was chiefly directed.  He was the most powerful and the richest.  One day he went, with a single  squire behind him, to the Duke of Burgundy's house; and, \"My lord,\" said  he, \"many knights and squires are persecuting me to get the money which  is owing to them.  I know not where to find it.  The chancellor and the  treasurer refer me to you.  Since it is you and the Duke of Berry who  govern, may it please you to give me an answer.\"  \"Clisson,\" said the  duke, \"you have no occasion to trouble yourself about the state of the  kingdom; it will manage very well without your services.  Whence, pray,  have you been able to amass so much money?  My lord, my brother of Berry  and myself have not so much between us three.  Away from my presence, and  let me see you no more!  If I had not a respect for myself, I would have  your other eye put out.\"  Clisson went out, mounted his horse, returned  to his house, set his affairs in order, and departed, with two  attendants, to his strong castle of Montlhery.  The two dukes were very  sorry that they had not put him under arrest on the spot.  The rupture  came to a climax.  Of the king's four other councillors one escaped in  time; two were seized and thrown into prison; the fourth, Bureau de la  Riviere was at his castle of Auneau, near Chartres, honored and beloved  by all his neighbors.  Everybody urged him to save himself.  \"If I were  to fly or hide myself,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11954"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 4 (#5)"],[1,"church herself in       her relations with her head, the pope, by proclaiming the necessity       for the regular intervention of councils and their superiority in       regard to the pope;         3.  To prevent or reform abuses in the relations of the papacy with       the state and church of France in the matter of ecclesiastical       tribute, especially as to the receipt by the pope, under the name of       annates, of the first year's revenue of the different ecclesiastical       offices and benefices.    In the fifteenth century it was the general opinion in France, in state  and in church, that there was in these dispositions nothing more than the  primitive and traditional liberties and rights of the Christian church.  There was no thought of imposing upon the papacy any new regimen, but  only of defending the old and legitimate regimen, recognized and upheld  by St. Louis in the thirteenth century as well as by Charles VII. in the  fifteenth.    The popes, nevertheless, had all of them protested since the days of  Charles VII. against the Pragmatic Sanction as an attack upon their  rights, and had demanded its abolition.  In 1461, Louis XI., as has  already been shown, had yielded for a moment to the demand of Pope Pius  II., whose countenance he desired to gain, and had abrogated the  Pragmatic; but, not having obtained what he wanted thereby, and having  met with strong opposition in the Parliament of Paris to his concession,  he had let it drop without formally retracting it, and, instead of  engaging in a conflict with Parliament upon the point, he thought it no  bad plan for the magistracy to uphold in principle and enforce in fact  the regulations of the Pragmatic Sanction.  This important edict, then,  was still vigorous in 1515, when Francis I., after his victory at  Melegnano and his reconciliation with the pope, left Chancellor Duprat  at Bologna to pursue the negotiation reopened on that subject.  The  compensation, of which Leo X., on redemanding the abolition of the  Pragmatic Sanction, had given a peep to Francis I., could not fail to  have charms for a prince so little scrupulous, and for his still less  scrupulous chancellor.  The pope proposed that the Pragmatic, once for  all abolished, should be replaced by a Concordat between the two  sovereigns, and that this Concordat, whilst putting a stop to the  election of the clergy by the faithful, should transfer to the king the  right of nomination to bishoprics and other great ecclesiastical offices  and benefices, reserving to the pope the right of presentation of  prelates nominated by the king.  This, considering the condition of  society and government in the sixteenth century, in the absence of  political and religious liberty, was to take away from the church her own  existence, and divide her between two masters, without giving her, as  regarded either of them, any other guarantee of independence than the  mere chance of their dissensions and quarrels.    Egotism, even in kings, has often narrow and short-sighted views.  It was  calculated that there were in France at this period ten archbishoprics,  eighty-three bishoprics, and five hundred and twenty-seven abbeys.  Francis I. and his chancellor saw in the proposed Concordat nothing but  the great increment of influence it secured to them, by making all the  dignitaries of the church suppliants at first and then clients of the  kingship.  After some difficulties as to points of detail, the Concordat  was concluded and signed on the 18th of August, 1516.  Five months  afterwards, on the 5th of February, 1517, the king repaired in person to  Parliament, to which he had summoned many prelates and doctors of the  University.  The chancellor explained the points of the Concordat, and  recapitulated all the facts which, according to him, had made it  necessary.  The king ordered its registration, \"for the good of his  kingdom and for quittance of the promise he had given the pope.\"  Parliament on one side, and the prelates and doctors of the University  on the other, deliberated upon this demand.  Their first answer was that,  as the matter concerned the interest of the whole Gallican church, they  could not themselves decide about it, and that the church, assembled in  national council, alone had the right of pronouncing judgment.  \"Oho! so  you cannot,\" said the king; \"I will soon let you see that you can, or I  will send you all to Rome to give the pope your reasons.\"  To the  question of conscience the Parliament found thenceforth added the  question of dignity.  The magistrates raised difficulties in point of  form, and asked for time to discuss the matter fundamentally; and  deputies went to carry their request to the king.  He admitted the  propriety of delay, but with this comment: \"I know that there are in my  Parliament good sort of men, wise men; but I also know that there are  turbulent and rash fools; I have my eye upon them; and I am informed of  the language they dare to hold about my conduct.  I am king as my  predecessors were; and I mean to be obeyed as they were.  You are  constantly vaporing to me about Louis XII. and his love of justice; know  ye that justice is as dear to me as it was to him; but that king, just as  he was, often drove out from the kingdom rebels, though they were members  of Parliament; do not force me to imitate him in his severity.\"  Parliament entered upon a fundamental examination of the question; their  deliberations lasted from the 13th to the 24th of July, 1517; and the  conclusion they came to was, that Parliament could not and ought not to  register the Concordat; that, if the king persisted in his intention of  making it a law of the realm, he must employ the same means as Charles  VII. had employed for establishing the Pragmatic Sanction, and that,  therefore, he must summon a general council.  On the 14th of January,  1518, two councillors arrived at Amboise, bringing to the king the  representations of the Parliament.  When their arrival was announced to  the king, \"Before I receive them,\" said he, \"I will drag them about at my  heels as long as they have made me wait.\"  He received them, however, and  handed their representations over to the chancellor, bidding him reply to  them.  Duprat made a learned and specious reply, but one which left  intact the question of right, and, at bottom, merely defended the  Concordat on the ground of the king's good pleasure and requirements of  policy.  On the last day of February, 1518, the king gave audience to the  deputies, and handed them the chancellor's reply.  They asked to examine  it.  \"You shall not examine it,\" said the king; \"this would degenerate  into an endless process.  A hundred of your heads, in Parliament, have  been seven months and more painfully getting up these representations,  which my chancellor has blown to the winds in a few days.  There is but  one king in France; I have done all I could to restore peace to my  kingdom; and I will not allow nullification here of that which I brought  about with so much difficulty in Italy.  My Parliament would set up for a  Venetian Senate; let it confine its meddling to the cause of justice,  which is worse administered than it has been for a hundred years; I  ought, perhaps, to drag it about at my heels, like the Grand Council, and  watch more closely over its conduct.\"  The two deputies made an attempt  to prolong their stay at Amboise: but, \"If before six to-morrow morning,\"  said the king, \"they be not gone, I will send some archers to take them  and cast them into a dungeon for six months; and woe to whoever dares to  speak to me for them!\"    On returning to Paris the deputies were beginning to give their fellows  an account of how harsh a reception they met with, when Louis de la  Tremoille, the most respected amongst the chiefs of the army, entered the  hall.  He came by order of the king to affirm to the Parliament that to  dismiss the Concordat was to renew the war, and that it must obey on the  instant or profess open rebellion.  Parliament upheld its decision of  July 24, 1517, against the Concordat, at the same time begging La  Tremoille to write to the king to persuade him, if he insisted upon  registration, to send some person of note or to commission La Tremoille  himself to be present at the act, and to see indorsed upon the Concordat,  \"Read, published, and registered at the king's most express command  several times repeated, in presence of .  .  .  , specially deputed by  him for that purpose.\"  Tremoille hesitated to write, and exhibited the  letters whereby the king urged him to execute the strict orders laid upon  him.  \"What are those orders, then?\" asked the premier president.  \"That  is the king's secret,\" answered La Tremoille: \"I may not reveal it; all  that I can tell you is, that I should never have peace of mind if you  forced me to carry them out.\"  The Parliament in its excitement begged La  Tremoille to withdraw, and sent for him back almost immediately.  \"Choose,\" said the premier president to him, \"between Saturday or Monday  next to be present at the registration.\"  La Tremoille chose Monday,  wishing to allow himself time for an answer even yet from the king.  But  no new instructions came to him; and on the 22d of March, 1518,  Parliament proceeded to registration of the Concordat, with the forms and  reservations which they had announced, and which were evidence of  compulsion.  The other Parliaments of France followed with more or less  zeal, according to their own particular dispositions, the example shown  by that of Paris.  The University was heartily disposed to push  resistance farther than had been done by Parliament: its rector caused to  be placarded on the 27th of March, 1518, in the streets of Paris, an  order forbidding all printers and booksellers to print the Concordat on  pain of losing their connection with the University.  The king commanded  informations to be filed"]]]
