If I hold an open cylinder in my left hand and a piston in my  right, and place the piston within the cylinder, I here have a confined  volume of air at the temperature and the pressure of this room. These  particles of air are in motion and produce heat and pressure in  proportion to that motion. Now if I press the piston to a point in the  center of the cylinder, that is, to one-half the stroke, I here decrease  the distance between the cylinder head and the piston just one-half,  hence each molecule of air strikes twice as many blows upon the piston  and head in traveling the same distance and the pressure is doubled. We  have also produced about 116 degrees of heat, because we have expended a  certain amount of work upon the air; the air has done no work in return,  but we have increased the energy of molecular vibration in the air and  the result is heat.    But what of this heat? What harm does it do? If I instantly release the  piston which I hold at one-half stroke it will return to its original  position, less only a little friction. I have, therefore, recovered all,  or nearly all, the power spent in compressing the air. I have simply  pressed a spring, and have let it recover. We see what a perfect spring  compressed air is. We see the possibility of expending one horse power  of energy upon air and getting almost exactly one horse power in return.  Such would be the case provided we used the compressed air power  _immediately and at the point where the compression takes place_. This  is never done, but the heat which has been boxed up[1] in the air is  lost by radiation, and we have lost power. Let us see to what extent  this takes place.    [Footnote 1: I use material terms because they add to simplicity of  expression and notwithstanding the fact that heat is vibration.]    Thirteen cubic feet of free air at normal temperature and barometric  pressure weigh about one pound. We have seen that 116 degrees of heat  have been liberated at half stroke. The gauge pressure at this point  reaches 24 pounds. According to Mariotte's law, \"The temperature  remaining constant, the volume varies inversely as the pressure,\" we  should have 15 pounds gauge pressure. The difference, 9 pounds,  represents the effect of the heat of compression in increasing the  relative volume of the air.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.: CURVES OF COMPRESSION ILLUSTRATEDIN VOLUMES,  PRESSURES, AND TEMPERATURES.]    The specific heat of air under constant pressure being 0.238, we have  0.238 x 116 = 27.6 heat units produced by compressing one pound or  thirteen cubic feet of free air into one-half its volume. 27.6 x 772  (Joule's equivalent) = 21,307 foot pounds. We know that 33,000 foot  pounds is one horse power, and we see how easily about two-thirds of a  horse power in heat units may be produced and lost in compressing one  pound of air. I would mention here that exactly this same loss is  suffered when compressed air does work in an engine and is expanded down  to its original pressure. In other words, _the heat of compression and  the cold of expansion are in degree equal_.    Experiments made by M. Regnault and others on the influence of heat on  pressures and volumes of gases have enabled us to fix the absolute zero  of temperature as -461 degrees Fahrenheit. This point, 461 degrees below  zero, is the theoretical point at which a volume of air is reduced to  nothing. The volume of air at different temperatures is in proportion to  the absolute temperature, and on this basis Box gives us the following  table:    TABLE l.--OF THE VOLUME AND WEIGHT OF DRY AIR AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES  UNDER A CONSTANT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE OF 29.92 INCHES OF MERCURY IN THE  BAROMETER (ONE ATMOSPHERE), THE VOLUME AT 32 deg.

Compared with the practice in the mercantile marine, the revolutions of  these screws are very high, and from the foregoing remarks it may appear  that much larger screws would be required for a merchant ship than for a  war ship of the same displacement and speed. There would, however, be  several items favorable to the use of small screws. For a given  displacement the resistance would be less in the mercantile ship, and with  the lower revolutions the proportion of blade area to the disk could be  increased without impairing the efficiency. Thus in passing from the war  vessel to a merchant ship of the same displacement, there are the lower  revolutions favorable to a larger screw, but, on the other hand, the  smaller resistance, larger proportion of blade area, and the coarser pitch,  are favorable to a diminution of the screw. The ship B has a very large  screw at 88 revolutions, but the tips are very narrow. If the blade were as  dotted for a diameter of 16 ft., the same work could be done with the same  revolutions, but with a little coarser pitch and a little more slip.    There is something to be said for large screws with a small proportion of  blade area to disk. For instance, two bladed screws have frequently given  better results than four bladed screws of smaller diameter, neglecting, of  course, the question of vibrations. Twin screws, however, should, as a  rule, be made as small as possible in diameter without loss of efficiency.  The advantages of small twin screws are the shorter shaft tubes and stern  brackets, deeper immersion, and less exposure as compared with large  screws. The exposure of the screws is usually considered an objection, but,  perhaps, too much has been made of it, for those well qualified to speak on  the subject consider that careful handling of the ship would, in most  cases, prevent damage to the screws, and that where the exposure is  unusually great, effectual protection by portable protectors presents no  insuperable difficulty.

In these  ships, however, there is nothing about the slips which would give rise to  any doubts as to the fitness of the screws for their work.    [Illustration: FIG. 5. & FIG. 6.]    The ancient fallacy that small slip meant a high screw efficiency was  supported by the great authority of the late Professor Rankine. Experience  proved that considerable slips and efficient screws were companions. The  late Mr. Froude offered an explanation of this general rule in a paper read  before this Institution in 1878, and gave a curve of efficiency with  varying true slip. In Mr. R E. Froude's paper last year there was a form of  this curve, with an arbitrary abscissa scale for the slip, devised to  illustrate in one diagram the wide conditions covered by his experiments.  In the screws now under consideration, the values of the pitch/diameter  vary only from 1.2 to 1.34, and for these the abscissa values for the same  slips do not differ much. Taking the mean value, and bringing the slips to  a common scale, Fig. 5 is obtained, which would approximately represent the  relation between the efficiency of any one of these screws and its true  slip, if this curve were applicable to full sized screws propelling actual  ships. The slips in Fig. 5 being real or true, are not the slips of  commerce, which are the apparent slips, such as those given in the table.  Let us endeavor to split up these real slips into the apparent slips and  another item, the speed of the wake. We then at once meet with the  difficulty that the wake in which the screw works has not a uniform motion.  Complex, however, as are the motions of the wake, the screw may be assumed  to work in a cylinder of water having such a uniform forward velocity as  will produce the same effect as the actual wake on the thrust of the screw.  It is then readily seen that the real slip is the sum of the apparent slip  and the speed of the hypothetical wake. To make this clear, let V be the  speed of the ship, Vs the speed of the screw, _i.e._, revolutions x pitch,  and V the speed of the wake; then--    Apparent slip = Vs - V.      Real slip = Vs - speed of ship with respect to the wake.              \" = Vs - (V - V) = (Vs - V) + Vw.              \" = Apparent slip + speed of the wake.    If the apparent slip be zero, the real slip is the speed of the wake, and  if the apparent slip be negative, the real slip is less than the speed of  the wake. The real slip is greater than the apparent slip, and can never be  a negative quantity. From Mr. Froude's model experiments, it appears that  this speed of wake for the A class of ship amounts to about 10 per cent. of  the speed of the A screw. If this value is correct, then the real slip is  (10 + 17.6) per cent., or 27.6 per cent. This is shown in Fig. 6, where O  is the point of no slip, being 17.64 from the point of real slip. Slips to  the right of O are positive apparent slips, slips to the left are negative  apparent slips. The vessel F would certainly have a wake with a speed  considerably less than that of A's wake. From the model experiments, the  wake for F is about one-half that for the A class, or, roughly, 5 per cent.  of the speed of the screw. For the ship F, O is the point of no apparent  slip, and the real slip is (5 + 11.4) or 16.4 per cent. For E, the point of  real slip is approximately the same as for F. For B and D, the positions on  the curve would be about the same. The ship B has a higher speed of wake  than D, but the screw D has the greater apparent slip. The influence of the  number of blades on the scale for the slip has been neglected. If this  efficiency curve were applicable to full sized screws propelling actual  ships, and if the determination of the wakes were beyond question, then we  should have a proof that our screws were at or near the maximum efficiency.  But, as we know, from the total propulsive efficiencies, that the screws  have high and not widely different efficiencies on these ships, we may  argue the other way, and say that there is good reason to consider that at  least the upper part of the curve agrees with experience obtained from  actual ships. Now take Fig. 6 and consider the general laws there  represented. Take the speed of the wake as 10 per cent. of the speed of the  screw, which is probably an average of widely different conditions,  including many single as well as twin screw ships. Then this curve shows  that considerable negative slips mean inefficient screws; that screws may  have very different positive slips without any appreciable difference in  their efficiencies; and that very large positive slips and inefficient  screws may be companions.
