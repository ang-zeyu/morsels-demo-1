From 2 to 3 degrees South latitude the wind is very  irregular, and frequently excessively violent.  Today we passed the  8 degrees South latitude, without seeing land, which put the captain  in the best of humours.  He explained to us, that if we had seen  land, we should have been obliged to retrace our course almost to  the line, because the current sets in with such violence towards the  land, that the voyage could only be made at a proper distance.    7th September.  Between 10 and 20 degrees South latitude we again  met with very peculiar prevalent winds.  They are called vamperos;  and oblige the sailor to be always on his guard, as they spring up  very suddenly, and are often extremely violent.  We were overtaken  by one during the night, but, luckily, it was not of the worst kind.  In a few hours it had entirely passed over, but the sea did not  become calm again for a considerable time.    On the 9th and 11th of September, we encountered some short gusts of  the vamperos, the most violent being the last.    12th and 13th of September.  The first was termed by the captain  merely \"a stiffish breeze;\" but the second was entered in the log  {12} as \"a storm.\"  The stiffish breeze cost us one sail; the storm,  two.  During the time it lasted, the sea ran so high, that it was  with the greatest difficulty we could eat.  With one hand we were  obliged to grasp the plate, and at the same time to hold fast on to  the table, while, with the other, we managed, with considerable  difficulty, to convey the food to our mouth.  At night, I was  obliged to \"stow\" myself firmly in my berth with my cloaks and  dresses, to protect my body from being bruised black and blue.    On the morning of the 13th, I was on deck at break of day.  The  helmsman led me to the side of the vessel, and told me to hold my  head overboard, and inhale the air.  I breathed a most beautiful  perfume of flowers.  I looked round in astonishment, and imagined  that I must already be able to see the land:  it was, however, still  far distant, the soft perfume being merely drifted to us by the  wind.  It was very remarkable that inside the ship this perfume was  not at all perceptible.    The sea itself was covered with innumerable dead butterflies and  moths, which had been carried out to sea by the storm.  Two pretty  little birds, quite exhausted by their long flight, were resting  upon one of the yards.    For us, who, during two months and a half, had seen nothing but sky  and water, all these things were most satisfactory; and we looked  out anxiously for Cape Frio, which we were very near.  The horizon,  however, was lowering and hazy, and the sun had not force enough to  tear the murky veil asunder.  We looked forward with joy to the next  morning, but during the night were overtaken by another storm, which  lasted until 2 o'clock.  The ship's course was changed, and she was  driven as far as possible into the open sea; so that, in the end, we  were glad enough to reach, the next day, the same position we had  occupied the morning before.    Today we caught no glimpse of land; but a few gulls and albatrosses  from Cape Frio warned us that we were near it, and afforded us some  little amusement.  They swam close up to the ship's side, and  eagerly swallowed every morsel of bread or meat that was thrown to  them.  The sailors tried to catch some with a hook and line, and  were fortunate enough to succeed.  They were placed upon the deck,  and, to my great surprise, I perceived that they were unable to  raise themselves from it.  If we touched them, they merely dragged  themselves, with great difficulty, a few paces further, although  they could rise very easily from the surface of the water, and fly  extremely high.    One of the gentlemen was exceedingly anxious to kill and stuff one  of them, but the superstition of the sailors was opposed to this.  They said that if birds were killed on board ship, their death would  be followed by long calms.  We yielded to their wishes and restored  the little creatures to the air and waves, their native elements.    This was another proof that superstition is still deep-rooted in the  minds of sailors.  Of this we had afterwards many other instances.  The captain, for example, was always very averse to the passengers  amusing themselves with cards or any other game of chance; in  another vessel, as I was informed, no one was allowed to write on  Sunday, etc.  Empty casks or logs of wood were also very frequently  thrown overboard during a calm--probably as sacrifices to the  deities of the winds.    On the morning of the 16th of September we at last had the good  fortune to perceive the mountains before Rio Janeiro, and soon  singled out the Sugarloaf.  At 2 o'clock, P.M., we entered the bay  and port of Rio Janeiro.    Immediately at the entrance of the bay are several conical rocks,  some of which, like the Sugarloaf, rise singly from the sea, while  others are joined at the base, and are almost inaccessible. {13}  Between these \"ocean mountains,\" if I may be allowed the expression,  are seen the most remarkably beautiful views; now extraordinary  ravines, then some charmingly situated quarter of the town,  presently the open sea, and the moment after some delightful bay.  From the bay itself, at the end of which the capital is built, rise  masses of rock, serving as foundations to different fortifications.  On some of these eminences are chapels and fortresses.  Ships are  obliged to pass as near as possible to one of the largest of the  latter, namely, Santa Cruz, in order that their papers may be  examined.    From this fortress, to the right, stretches the beautiful mountain  range of the Serados-Orgoas, which, in conjunction with other  mountains and hills, fringes a lovely bay, on the shores of which  lie the little town of Praya-grande, some few villages and detached  farmhouses.    At the extremity of the principal bay, stands Rio Janeiro,  surrounded by a tolerably high chain of mountains (among which is  the Corcovado, 2,100 feet high), behind which, more inland, is the  Organ Mountain, which owes its name to its many gigantic peaks  placed upright one against the other like the pipes of an organ.  The highest peak is 5,000 feet high.    One portion of the town is concealed by the Telegraph Mountain, and  several hills, on which, besides the Telegraph, there is a monastery  of Capuchin monks and other smaller buildings.  Of the town itself  are seen several rows of houses and open squares, the Great  Hospital, the Monasteries of St. Luzia and Moro do Castello, the  Convent of St. Bento, the fine Church of St. Candelaria, and some  portions of the really magnificent aqueduct.  Close to the sea is  the Public Garden (passeo publico) of the town, which, from its fine  palm trees, and elegant stone gallery, with two summer-houses, forms  a striking object.  To the left, upon eminences, stand some isolated  churches and monasteries, such as St. Gloria, St. Theresa, etc.  Near these are the Praya Flamingo and Botafogo, large villages with  beautiful villas, pretty buildings, and gardens, which stretch far  away until lost in the neighbourhood of the Sugarloaf, and thus  close this most wonderful panorama.  In addition to all this, the  many vessels, partly in the harbour before the town, partly anchored  in the different bays, the rich and luxuriant vegetation, and the  foreign and novel appearance of the whole, help to form a picture,  of whose beauties my pen, unfortunately, can never convey an  adequate idea.    It rarely happens that a person is so lucky as to enjoy, immediately  on his arrival, so beautiful and extensive a view as fell to my lot;  fogs, clouds, or a hazy state of the atmosphere, very often conceal  certain portions, and thus disturb the wonderful impression of the  whole.  Whenever this is the case, I would advise every one, who  intends stopping any time in Rio Janeiro, to take a boat, on a  perfectly clear day, as far as Santa Cruz, in order to behold this  peculiarly beautiful prospect.    It was almost dark before we reached the place of anchorage.  We  were first obliged to stop at Santa Cruz to have the ship's papers  examined, and then appear before an officer, who took from us our  passports and sealed letters; then before a surgeon, who inspected  us to see that we had not brought the plague or yellow fever; and  lastly, before another officer, who took possession of different  packets and boxes, and assigned us the spot to anchor in.    It was now too late for us to land, and the captain alone proceeded  on shore.  We, however, remained for a long time on deck,  contemplating the magnificent picture before us, until both land and  sea lay shrouded in night.    With a light heart did we all retire to rest; the goal of our long  voyage had been attained without any misfortune worthy of being  mentioned.  A cruel piece of intelligence was in store for the poor  tailor's wife alone; but the good captain did not break it to her  today, in order to let her enjoy an undisturbed night's rest.  As  soon as the tailor heard that his wife was really on her passage  out, he ran off with a negress, and left nought behind but--debts.    The poor woman had given up a sure means of subsistence in her  native land (she supported herself by cleaning lace and ladies'  apparel), and had devoted her little savings to pay the expenses of  her voyage, and all to find herself deserted and helpless in a  strange hemisphere. {14}    From Hamburgh to Rio Janeiro is about 8,750 miles.

The feathers of the mind refused  here to lie one way. They ruffled, pointed, and grew wild.    Luxurious furniture does not mean comfort; I might as well have tried to  settle down in the sofa and armchair department of a big shop. My  bedroom was easily managed; it was the private workroom, prepared  especially for my reception, that made me feel alien and outcast.    Externally, it was all one could desire: an antechamber to the great  library, with not one, but two generous oak tables, to say nothing of  smaller ones against the walls with capacious drawers.    There were reading desks, mechanical devices for holding books, perfect  light, quiet as in a church, and no approach but across the huge  adjoining room. Yet it did not invite.    \"I hope you'll be able to work here,\" said my little hostess the next  morning, as she took me in--her only visit to it while I stayed in the  house--and showed me the ten-volume Catalogue.    \"It's absolutely quiet and no one will disturb you.\"    \"If you can't, Bill, you're not much good,\" laughed Frances, who was on  her arm. \"Even I could write in a study like this!\"    I glanced with pleasure at the ample tables, the sheets of thick  blotting paper, the rulers, sealing wax, paper knives, and all the other  immaculate paraphernalia. \"It's perfect,\" I answered with a secret  thrill, yet feeling a little foolish. This was for Gibbon or Carlyle,  rather than for my potboiling insignificancies. \"If I can't write  masterpieces here, it's certainly not your fault,\" and I turned with  gratitude to Mrs. Franklyn. She was looking straight at me, and there  was a question in her small pale eyes I did not understand. Was she  noting the effect upon me, I wondered?    \"You'll write here--perhaps a story about the house,\" she said,  \"Thompson will bring you anything you want; you only have to ring.\" She  pointed to the electric bell on the central table, the wire running  neatly down the leg. \"No one has ever worked here before, and the  library has been hardly used since it was put in. So there's no previous  atmosphere to affect your imagination--er--adversely.\"    We laughed. \"Bill isn't that sort,\" said my sister; while I wished they  would go out and leave me to arrange my little nest and set to work.    I thought, of course, it was the huge listening library that made me  feel so inconsiderable--the fifteen thousand silent, staring books, the  solemn aisles, the deep, eloquent shelves. But when the women had gone  and I was alone, the beginning of the truth crept over me, and I felt  that first hint of disconsolateness which later became an imperative No.  The mind shut down, images ceased to rise and flow. I read, made copious  notes, but I wrote no single line at The Towers.    Nothing completed itself there. Nothing happened.    The morning sunshine poured into the library through ten long narrow  windows; birds were singing; the autumn air, rich with a faint aroma of  November melancholy that stung the imagination pleasantly, filled my  antechamber. I looked out upon the undulating wooded landscape, hemmed  in by the sweep of distant Downs, and I tasted a whiff of the sea. Rooks  cawed as they floated above the elms, and there were lazy cows in the  nearer meadows. A dozen times I tried to make my nest and settle down to  work, and a dozen times, like a turning fastidious dog upon a hearth  rug, I rearranged my chair and books and papers. The temptation of the  Catalogue and shelves, of course, was accountable for much, yet not, I  felt, for all. That was a manageable seduction. My work, moreover, was  not of the creative kind that requires absolute absorption; it was the  mere readable presentation of data I had accumulated. My notebooks were  charged with facts ready to tabulate--facts, too, that interested me  keenly. A mere effort of the will was necessary, and concentration of no  difficult kind. Yet, somehow, it seemed beyond me: something forever  pushed the facts into disorder ... and in the end I sat in the sunshine,  dipping into a dozen books selected from the shelves outside, vexed with  myself and only half-enjoying it. I felt restless. I wanted to be  elsewhere.    And even while I read, attention wandered. Frances, Mabel, her late  husband, the house and grounds, each in turn and sometimes all together,  rose uninvited into the stream of thought, hindering any consecutive  flow of work. In disconnected fashion came these pictures that  interrupted concentration, yet presenting themselves as broken fragments  of a bigger thing my mind already groped for unconsciously. They  fluttered round this hidden thing of which they were aspects, fugitive  interpretations, no one of them bringing complete revelation. There was  no adjective, such as pleasant or unpleasant, that I could attach to  what I felt, beyond that the result was unsettling. Vague as the  atmosphere of a dream, it yet persisted, and I could not dissipate it.    Isolated words or phrases in the lines I read sent questions scouring  across my mind, sure sign that the deeper part of me was restless and  ill at ease.    Rather trivial questions too--half-foolish interrogations, as of a  puzzled or curious child: Why was my sister afraid to sleep alone, and  why did her friend feel a similar repugnance, yet seek to conquer it?  Why was the solid luxury of the house without comfort, its shelter  without the sense of permanence? Why had Mrs. Franklyn asked us to come,  artists, unbelieving vagabonds, types at the farthest possible remove  from the saved sheep of her husband's household? Had a reaction set in  against the hysteria of her conversion? I had seen no signs of religious  fervor in her; her atmosphere was that of an ordinary, high-minded  woman, yet a woman of the world. Lifeless, though, a little, perhaps,  now that I came to think about it: she had made no definite impression  upon me of any kind. And my thoughts ran vaguely after this fragile  clue.    Closing my book, I let them run. For, with this chance reflection came  the discovery that I could not see her clearly--could not feel her soul,  her personality. Her face, her small pale eyes, her dress and body and  walk, all these stood before me like a photograph; but her Self evaded  me. She seemed not there, lifeless, empty, a shadow--nothing. The  picture was disagreeable, and I put it by. Instantly she melted out, as  though light thought had conjured up a phantom that had no real  existence. And at that very moment, singularly enough, my eye caught  sight of her moving past the window, going silently along the gravel  path. I watched her, a sudden new sensation gripping me. \"There goes a  prisoner,\" my thought instantly ran, \"one who wishes to escape, but  cannot.\"    What brought the outlandish notion, heaven only knows. The house was of  her own choice, she was twice an heiress, and the world lay open at her  feet. Yet she stayed--unhappy, frightened, caught. All this flashed over  me, and made a sharp impression even before I had time to dismiss it as  absurd. But a moment later explanation offered itself, though it seemed  as far-fetched as the original impression. My mind, being logical, was  obliged to provide something, apparently. For Mrs. Franklyn, while  dressed to go out, with thick walking-boots, a pointed stick, and a  motor-cap tied on with a veil as for the windy lanes, was obviously  content to go no farther than the little garden paths. The costume was a  sham and a pretence. It was this, and her lithe, quick movements that  suggested a caged creature--a creature tamed by fear and cruelty that  cloaked themselves in kindness--pacing up and down, unable to realize  why it got no farther, but always met the same bars in exactly the same  place. The mind in her was barred.    I watched her go along the paths and down the steps from one terrace to  another, until the laurels hid her altogether; and into this mere  imagining of a moment came a hint of something slightly disagreeable,  for which my mind, search as it would, found no explanation at all. I  remembered then certain other little things. They dropped into the  picture of their own accord. In a mind not deliberately hunting for  clues, pieces of a puzzle sometimes come together in this way, bringing  revelation, so that for a second there flashed across me, vanishing  instantly again before I could consider it, a large, distressing  thought. I can only describe vaguely as a Shadow.    Dark and ugly, oppressive certainly it might be described, with  something torn and dreadful about the edges that suggested pain and  strife and terror. The interior of a prison with two rows of occupied  condemned cells, seen years ago in New York, sprang to memory after it--  the connection between the two impossible to surmise even. But the  \"certain other little things\" mentioned above were these: that Mrs.  Franklyn, in last night's dinner talk, had always referred to \"this  house,\" but never called it \"home\"; and had emphasized unnecessarily,  for a well-bred woman, our \"great kindness\" in coming down to stay so  long with her. Another time, in answer to my futile compliment about the  \"stately rooms,\" she said quietly, \"It is an enormous house for so small  a party; but I stay here very little, and only till I get it straight  again.\" The three of us were going up the great staircase to bed as this  was said, and, not knowing quite her meaning, I dropped the subject. It  edged delicate ground, I felt. Frances added no word of her own. It now  occurred to me abruptly that \"stay\" was the word made use of, when  \"live\" would have been more natural. How insignificant to recall! Yet  why did they suggest themselves just at this moment ...?    And, on going to Frances's room to make sure she was not nervous or  lonely, I realized abruptly, that Mrs. Franklyn, of course, had talked  with "]]]
