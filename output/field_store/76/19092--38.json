[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11114"],[0,"Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, (#5)"],[1,"suffrage was unknown among men.    Has the millennium yet dawned? Is all progress at an end? If that  which is should therefore remain, why abolish the slavery of men?    But we are informed that woman does not vote when she has the  opportunity. Wherever she has the unrestricted right she exercises it.  The records of Wyoming and Washington demonstrate the fact.    And in these Territories, too, as well as wherever else she has  exercised the suffrage, she has elevated man to her own level, and  has made the voting precinct as respectable and decorous as the  lecture-room or the assemblies of the devout. All the experience there  is refutes the apprehension of those who fear that woman will either  neglect the discharge of her great duty, when allowed its fair and  equal exercise, or that the rude and baser sort will overwhelm and  banish the noble and refined.    But to my mind it seems like trifling with a great subject to dwell  upon topics like this. It can only be justified by the continual  iteration of the objection by the opponents of woman suffrage, who in  the lack of substantial grounds whereupon to base their opposition to  the exercise of a great right by one-half the community declare that  there is no time in which woman can vote.    I will now read an extract from the report of the majority of the  committee, showing to a certain extent the degree of consequence which  this movement has assumed, its extent throughout our country, and  something of its duration. I have not the latest data, for since this  report was compiled there has been action in several States, and a  great deal of popular discussion and a vast amount of demonstration  from the action of popular assemblies.    The committee say:        This movement for woman suffrage has developed during the last      half century into one of great strength. The first petition was      presented to the Legislature of New York in 1835. It was repeated      in 1846, and since that time the petition has been urged upon      nearly every Legislature in the Northern States. Five States      have voted upon the question of amending their constitutions by      striking out the word \"male\" from the suffrage clause--Kansas in      1867, Michigan in 1874, Colorado in 1877, Nebraska in 1882, and      Oregon in 1884.        The ratio of the popular vote in each case was about one-third for      the amendment and two-thirds against it. Three Territories have or      have had full suffrage for women. In two, Wyoming since 1869      and Washington since 1883, the experiment (!) is an unqualified      success. In Utah Miss Anthony keenly and justly observes that      suffrage is as much of a success for the Mormon women as for the      men.        In eleven States school suffrage for women exists. In Kansas, from      her admission as a State. In Kentucky and Michigan fully as long      a time. School suffrage for women also exists in Colorado,      Minnesota, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Vermont, New York,      Nebraska, and Oregon.        In all these States, except Minnesota, school suffrage was      extended to women by the respective Legislatures, and in Minnesota      by the popular vote, in November, 1876. Not only these eleven      States, but in nearly all the other Northern and Western States      women are elected to the offices of county and city superintendent      of public schools and as members of school boards. In Louisiana      the constitution of 1879 makes women eligible to school offices.        It may also be observed as indicating a rising and controlling      public sentiment in recognition of the right and capacity of woman      for public affairs that she is eligible to such offices as that of      county clerk, register of deeds, and the like in many and perhaps      in all the States. Kansas and Iowa elected several women to these      positions in the election of November, 1885, while President Grant      alone appointed more than five thousand women to the office of      postmaster; and although many women have been appointed in the      Departments and to pension agencies and like important employments      and trusts, so far as your committee are aware no charge of      incompetency or of malfeasance in office has ever yet been      sustained against a woman.        It may be further stated in this connection that nearly every      Northern State has had before it from time to time since 1870 a      bill for the submission of the question of woman suffrage to the      popular vote. In some instances such a resolution has been passed      at one session and failed to be ratified at another by from one      to three votes; thus Iowa passed it in 1870, killed it in 1872;      passed it in 1874, failed to do so in 1876; passed it in 1878, and      failed in 1880; passed it again in 1882, and defeated it in      1884; four times over and over, and this winter these heroic and      indomitable women are trying it in Iowa again.        If men were to make such a struggle for their rights it would be      considered a fine thing, and there would be books and even poetry      written about it.        In New York, since 1880, the women have urged this great measure      before the Legislature each year. There it takes the form of a      bill to prohibit the disfranchisement of women. This bill has      several times come within five votes of passing the assembly.        In many States well sustained efforts for municipal suffrage have      been made, and, as if in rebuke to the conservatism, or worse, of      this great Republic, this right of municipal suffrage is already      enjoyed in the province of Ontario, Canada, and throughout the      island of Great Britain by unmarried women to the same extent as      by men, there being the same property qualification required of      each.        The movement for the amendment of the National Constitution began      by petitioning Congress December, 1865, and since 1869 there have      been consecutive applications to every Congress praying for the      submission to the States of a proposition similar to the joint      resolution herewith reported to the Senate.        The petitions have come from all parts of the country; more      especially from the Northern and Western States, although there is      an extensive and increasing desire for the suffrage existing among      the women in the Southern States, as we are informed by those      whose interest in the subject makes them familiar with the real      state of feeling in that part of our country. It is impossible      to know just what proportion of the people--men and women--have      expressed their desire by petition to the National Legislature      during the last twenty years, but we are informed by Miss Anthony      that in the year 1871 Senator Sumner collected the petitions from      the files of the Senate and House of Representatives, and that      there were then an immense number. A far greater number have been      presented since that time, and the same lady is our authority for      the estimate that in all more than two hundred thousand petitions,      by select and representative men and women, have been poured upon      Congress in behalf of this prayer of woman to be free. Who is so      interested in the framing of the law as woman, whose only defense      is the law? There never was a stronger exhibition of popular      demand by American citizens to be heard in the court of the people      for the vindication of a fundamental right.    Since the submission of the report the attempt has been made to secure  action in several of the State Legislatures. One which came very near  being successful was made in the State of Vermont. The suffrage was  extended, if I am not incorrectly informed, so far as the action of  the house of representatives of that State could give it, and an  effort being made to propose some restriction and condition upon the  suffrage it was defeated, when, as I am told by the friends of the  movement, if it could have reached a vote in the Vermont Legislature  on the naked proposition of suffrage to women as suffrage is extended  to men, they felt the very greatest confidence that they would have  been able to secure favorable action by the Legislature of that State.    Miss Anthony informs me since she came here at the present session  (and I am sorry I have not had the opportunity of extended conference  with her) that in the State of Kansas, where she spent several weeks  in the discussion of the subject before vast masses of people, the  largest halls, rinks, and places for the accommodation of popular  assemblages in the State were crowded to overflowing to listen to  her address. In every instance she has taken a vote of those vast  audiences as to whether they were in favor of woman suffrage or  against it, and in no single instance has there been a solitary vote  against the extension of the right, but affirmative and universal  action of those great assemblies demanding that it be extended to  women. And like demonstrations of popular approval are developing in  all parts of the country, perhaps not to so marked an extent as these  which I have just stated; but it is a growing feeling in this country  that women should have this right, and above all woman and man  demanding that she should have the opportunity to try her case before  the American people, that this right of petition should be heeded by  Congress and the joint resolution for the submission of the matter for  discussion by the States should be passed by the necessary two-thirds  vote.    It is sometimes, too, urged against this movement for the submission  of a resolution for a national constitutional amendment that women  should go to the States and fight it out there. But we did not send  the colored man to the States. No other amendment touching the general  national interest is left to be fought out by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],[0,"Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#5)"],[1," that's right!\" chorused several. \"This is no sport.\"    \"And it's no six-day walking match,\" sneered Roland Ditson. \"Merriwell  seems afraid to stand up and face Diamond.\"    \"Is that what you think?\" Frank mentally exclaimed. \"Well, I suppose I  will have to hit him a few times, although it goes against my grain.\"    A moment later he dropped his hands by his side and took a step to meet  the Virginian. It seemed like a great opportunity for Diamond, and he  led off straight for Frank's face, striking with his left.    With a slight side movement of his head Frank avoided the blow, allowing  his enemy's fist to pass over his shoulder. At the same time he cross  countered with his right hand, cracking Jack a heavy one under the ear.    \"Hooray!\" cried Harry Rattleton in delight. \"That was a corker! Bet  Sparkler saw more stars than there are in the Wilky May--I mean Milky  Way.\"    For a few minutes the fight was hot. Again and again Frank struck his  enemy, but without putting his full strength into any of the blows, but  it did not seem to have any effect on Diamond save to make him more  fierce and determined.    \"The Southerner's got some sand,\" commented Bruce Browning.    \"That's right,\" nodded Puss Parker.    \"He takes punishment well for a while, at least; but I don't believe he  will hold out much longer. I think he is the kind of a fellow to go to  pieces in an instant.\"    \"You can't tell about that. I have a fancy that he's deceptive.\"    None of them, save Rattleton, possibly, knew that Merriwell was  reserving any of his strength when he struck his foe.    The fellows who a short time before were the most indignant against the  Southerner because he seemed determined to \"blow\" were now forced to  admire his bulldog tenacity and sand.    Merriwell had no desire to severely injure Diamond, although he had felt  some resentment toward the fellow for forcing him into a duel with  rapiers.    To Frank it had seemed that the Virginian had no hesitation in taking  advantage of an enemy, for Diamond must have presumed that Merriwell  knew nothing of the art of fencing and swordplay.    But for this belief, Merriwell would have been inclined to keep on and  tire his enemy out, without striking a single blow that could leave a  mark.    But when Frank came to consider everything, he decided that it was no  more than fair that he should give his persistent foe a certain amount  of punishment.    Again and again Frank cross countered and upper-cut Diamond, and  gradually he came to strike harder as the Virginian forced the fighting,  without showing signs of letting up.    Bruises and swellings began to appear on Diamond's face. On one cheek  Merriwell's knuckles cut through the skin, and the blood began to run,  creeping down to his chin and dropping on the bosom of his white shirt.    Still, from the determination and fury with which he fought, it seemed  that Diamond was utterly unconscious that he had been struck at all.    Jack did not consider how he had led Frank into a duel with rapiers  without knowing whether the fellow he hated had ever taken a fencing  lesson in all his life.    His one thought was that, being an expert boxer himself, Merriwell had  forced him to a fist fight, believing it would be easy to dispose of him  that way.    Diamond's hatred of Frank made him blind to the fact that he was in the  least to blame, and filled him with a passionate belief that he could  kill the smiling Northerner without a qualm of conscience--without a  pang of remorse.    At last, disgusted with his non-success in striking Frank at all, he  sprang forward suddenly and grappled with him.    Frank had been on the watch for that move.    Then the boys saw a pretty struggle for a moment, ending with Diamond  being lifted and dropped heavily, squarely on his back.    Merriwell came down heavily on his persistent enemy.    Frank fell on Jack with the hope of knocking the wind out of the fellow  and thus bringing the fight to a close.    For a few moments it seemed that he had succeeded.    Frank sprang up lightly, just as Tad Horner grappled him by the hair  with both hands and yelled: \"Break away!\"    Roland Ditson was at Diamond's side in a twinkling.    \"Come, come, old man!\" he whispered; \"get up and get into the game  again! Don't let them count you out!\"    But the Virginian was gasping for breath, and he did not seem to hear  the words of his second.    \"That settles it,\" said Puss Parker, promptly.    \"Better wait and see,\" advised Bruce Browning. \"Diamond may not give up  when he gets his breath.\"    \"It doesn't look as if he'd ever get his breath again.\"    Harry Rattleton was at Frank's side, swiftly saying:    \"Why didn't you knock him out and show the fellows what you can do? You  monkeyed with the goat too long. He's stuffy, and you had to settle him  sometime. It didn't make a dit of bifference whether it was first or  last.\"    \"That's all right,\" smiled Frank. \"He's got sand, and I hated to nail  him hard. It seemed a shame to thump such a fellow and cover his face  with decorations.\"    \"Shame? shame?\" spluttered Harry. \"Why, didn't he force you into a duel  with rapiers, or try to? and he is an expert! Say, what's the matter  with you? If I'd been in your place I'd gone into him tooth and nail,  and I wouldn't have left him in the shape of anything. Have you got a  soft spot around you somewhere, Merriwell?\"    \"I admire sand, even if it is in an enemy.\"    \"You take the cherry pie--yes, you take the whole bakery!\"    Harry gazed at his roommate in wonder that was not entirely unmingled  with pity and disgust. He could not understand Merriwell, and such  generosity toward a persistent foe on the part of Frank seemed like  weakness.    In the meantime Ditson had been urging Diamond to get up.    \"They'll call the scrap finished if you don't get onto your pins in a  jiffy,\" he warned. \"Horner's got his watch in his hand.\"    Still the Virginian gasped for breath and seemed unable to lift a hand.  If ever a fellow seemed done up, it was Diamond just then.    Roll Ditson ground his teeth in despair.    \"Oh, Merriwell will think he is cock of the walk now!\" he muttered.  \"He'll crow and strut! He's laughing over it now!\"    \"Wh-what's that?\" gasped Diamond, trying to sit up.    \"He is laughing at you,\" hurriedly whispered Ditson, lying glibly. \"I  just heard him tell Rattleton that he could have knocked the stuffing  out of you in less than a quarter of a minute. He says you'll never dare  face him again.\"    \"Oh, he does! oh, he does!\" came huskily from Diamond's lips. \"Well,  we'll see about that--we'll see!\"    With Ditson's aid he got upon his feet. Then his breath and his strength  seemed to come to him in a twinkling. With a backward snap of his arm he  flung his second away. Then uttering a hoarse cry, he rushed like a mad  bull at the lad he hated.          CHAPTER V.    THE FINISH.      Diamond's recovery and the manner in which he resumed the fight caused  general astonishment. Even Bruce Browning had come to think that the  Virginian was \"out.\"    Frank was taken by surprise. Before he could square away to meet his  foe, Diamond struck him a terrific blow near the temple, knocking him  into Rattleton's arms.    \"Foul!\" cried Harry, excitedly. \"Horner hadn't given the word.\"    \"Foul! foul!\" came from all sides.    \"There is no foul in this fight save when something is used besides  fists,\" declared Merriwell as he staggered from his roommate's arms.  \"It's all right and it goes.\"    But he found that everything seemed swimming around him, and dark spots  were pursuing each other before his eyes. The floor seemed to heave like  the deck of a ship at sea. He put out his hand to grasp something, and  then he was struck again.    Once more Rattleton's arms kept Frank from going down.    \"This is no square deal!\" Harry shouted. \"By the poly hoker--I mean the  holy poker! I'll take a hand in this myself!\"    He would have released Merriwell and jumped into the ring, but Frank's  strong fingers closed on his arm.    \"Steady, old man!\" came sharply from Merriwell's lips. \"I am in this yet  awhile. If Diamond finishes me he is to be let alone. The fellow that  lays a hand on him is no friend of mine!\"    \"You give me cramps!\" groaned Harry.    Instead of aiding in finishing Frank, Diamond's second blow seemed to  straighten him up, as if it had cleared a fog from his brain. The spots  disappeared before his eyes and things ceased to swim around him.    Into the ring to meet his foe sprang Frank, and, to the astonishment of  everybody he still smiled.    At the same time, Merriwell knew he had toyed with Diamond too long. He  realized that the Virginian's first blow had come within a hair of  knocking him out, and he could still hear a faint, ringing and roaring  in his head.    Frank saw that the only way he could end the fight was to finish his  unrelenting and persistent foe.    Diamond fought like an infuriated tiger. Again and again Frank's fist  cracked on his face, and still he did not falter, but continued to  stand up and \"take his medicine.\"    In less than a minute the Virginian was bleeding at the nose, and had  received a blow in one of his eyes that was causing it to swell in a way  that threatened to close it entirely.    The spectators were greatly excited, and not a few of them declared it  was the most gamey fight they had ever witnessed.    The front of Diamond's shirt was stained with blood, and he presented a  sorry aspect. His chest was heaving, but his uninjured eye glared with  unabated fury and determination.    \"Will he never give up?\" muttered Harry Rattleton. \"He's a regular hog!  The fellow doesn't know when he has enough.\"    It was true Southern grit. It was the unyielding Southern spirit--the  spirit that led the soldiers of the South to make one of the pluckiest  struggles known in history.    While the fellow's grit had won Frank's admiration, still Merriwell "]]]
