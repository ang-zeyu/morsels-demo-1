See, I have written his name; he will come out to  us.    \"For what do you take me? I carry no messages, I keep the gate.\"    He then bawled, in a stentorian voice, inexorably:    \"No strangers enter here, but the competitors and their companies.\"    \"Come, old man,\" cried a voice in the crowd, \"you have gotten your  answer; make way.\"    Margaret turned half round imploringly:    \"Good people, we are come from far, and my father is old; and my cousin  has a new servant that knows us not, and would not let us sit in our  cousin's house.\"    At this the crowd laughed hoarsely. Margaret shrank as if they had  struck her. At that moment a hand grasped hers--a magic grasp; it felt  like heart meeting heart, or magnet steel. She turned quickly round at  it, and it was Gerard. Such a little cry of joy and appeal came from her  bosom, and she began to whimper prettily.    They had hustled her and frightened her, for one thing; and her cousin's  thoughtlessness, in not even telling his servant they were coming,  was cruel; and the servant's caution, however wise and faithful to her  master, was bitterly mortifying to her father and her. And to her so  mortified, and anxious and jostled, came suddenly this kind hand and  face. \"Hinc illae lacrimae.\"    \"All is well now,\" remarked a coarse humourist; \"she hath gotten her  sweetheart.\"    \"Haw! haw! haw!\" went the crowd.    She dropped Gerard's hand directly, and turned round, with eyes flashing  through her tears:    \"I have no sweetheart, you rude men. But I am friendless in your boorish  town, and this is a friend; and one who knows, what you know not, how to  treat the aged and the weak.\"    The crowd was dead silent. They had only been thoughtless, and now felt  the rebuke, though severe, was just. The silence enabled Gerard to treat  with the porter.    \"I am a competitor, sir.\"    \"What is your name?\" and the man eyed him suspiciously.    \"Gerard, the son of Elias.\"    The janitor inspected a slip of parchment he held in his hand:    \"Gerard Eliassoen can enter.\"    \"With my company, these two?\"    \"Nay; those are not your company they came before you.\"    \"What matter? They are my friends, and without them I go not in.\"    \"Stay without, then.\"    \"That will I not.\"    \"That we shall see.\"    \"We will, and speedily.\" And with this, Gerard raised a voice of  astounding volume and power, and routed so that the whole street rang:    \"Ho! PHILIP, EARL OF HOLLAND!\"    \"Are you mad?\" cried the porter.    \"HERE IS ONE OF YOUR VARLETS DEFIES YOU.\"    \"Hush, hush!\"    \"AND WILL NOT LET YOUR GUESTS PASS IN.\"    \"Hush! murder! The Dukes there. I'm dead,\" cried the janitor, quaking.    Then suddenly trying to overpower Gerard's thunder, he shouted, with all  his lungs:    \"OPEN THE GATE, YE KNAVES! WAY THERE FOR GERARD ELIASSOEN AND HIS  COMPANY! (The fiends go with him!)\"    The gate swung open as by magic. Eight soldiers lowered their pikes  halfway, and made an arch, under which the victorious three marched  in triumphant. The moment they had passed, the pikes clashed together  horizontally to bar the gateway, and all but pinned an abdominal citizen  that sought to wedge in along with them.    Once past the guarded portal, a few steps brought the trio upon a scene  of Oriental luxury. The courtyard was laid out in tables loaded with  rich meats and piled with gorgeous plate. Guests in rich and various  costumes sat beneath a leafy canopy of fresh-cut branches fastened  tastefully to golden, silver, and blue silken cords that traversed the  area; and fruits of many hues, including some artificial ones of gold,  silver, and wax, hung pendant, or peeped like fair eyes among the green  leaves of plane-trees and lime-trees. The Duke's minstrels swept their  lutes at intervals, and a fountain played red Burgundy in six jets that  met and battled in the air. The evening sun darted its fires through  those bright and purple wine spouts, making them jets and cascades of  molten rubies, then passing on, tinged with the blood of the grape,  shed crimson glories here and there on fair faces, snowy beards, velvet,  satin, jewelled hilts, glowing gold, gleaming silver, and sparkling  glass. Gerard and his friends stood dazzled, spell-bound. Presently  a whisper buzzed round them, \"Salute the Duke! Salute the Duke!\" They  looked up, and there on high, under the dais, was their sovereign,  bidding them welcome with a kindly wave of the hand. The men bowed low,  and Margaret curtsied with a deep and graceful obeisance. The Duke's  hand being up, he gave it another turn, and pointed the new-comers out  to a knot of valets. Instantly seven of his people, with an obedient  start, went headlong at our friends, seated them at a table, and put  fifteen many-coloured soups before them, in little silver bowls, and as  many wines in crystal vases.    \"Nay, father, let us not eat until we have thanked our good friend,\"  said Margaret, now first recovering from all this bustle.    \"Girl, he is our guardian angel.\"    Gerard put his face into his hands.    \"Tell me when you have done,\" said he, \"and I will reappear and have  my supper, for I am hungry. I know which of us three is the happiest at  meeting again.\"    \"Me?\" inquired Margaret.    \"No: guess again.\"    \"Father?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then I have no guess which it can be;\" and she gave a little crow of  happiness and gaiety. The soup was tasted, and vanished in a twirl  of fourteen hands, and fish came on the table in a dozen forms, with  patties of lobster and almonds mixed, and of almonds and cream, and an  immense variety of brouets known to us as rissoles. The next trifle was  a wild boar, which smelt divine. Why, then, did Margaret start away from  it with two shrieks of dismay, and pinch so good a friend as Gerard?  Because the Duke's cuisinier had been too clever; had made this  excellent dish too captivating to the sight as well as taste. He had  restored to the animal, by elaborate mimicry with burnt sugar and other  edible colours, the hair and bristles he had robbed him of by fire and  water. To make him still more enticing, the huge tusks were carefully  preserved in the brute's jaw, and gave his mouth the winning smile that  comes of tusk in man or beast; and two eyes of coloured sugar glowed  in his head. St. Argus! what eyes! so bright, so bloodshot, so  threatening--they followed a man and every movement of his knife and  spoon. But, indeed, I need the pencil of Granville or Tenniel to make  you see the two gilt valets on the opposite side of the table putting  the monster down before our friends, with a smiling, self-satisfied,  benevolent obsequiousness for this ghastly monster was the flower of all  comestibles--old Peter clasping both hands in pious admiration of  it; Margaret wheeling round with horror-stricken eyes and her hand on  Gerard's shoulder, squeaking and pinching; his face of unwise delight at  being pinched, the grizzly brute glaring sulkily on all, and the guests  grinning from ear to ear.    \"What's to do?\" shouted the Duke, hearing the signals of female  distress. Seven of his people with a zealous start went headlong and  told him. He laughed and said, \"Give her of the beef-stuffing, then, and  bring me Sir Boar.\" Benevolent monarch! The beef-stuffing was his own  private dish. On these grand occasions an ox was roasted whole, and  reserved for the poor. But this wise as well as charitable prince had  discovered, that whatever venison, bares, lamb, poultry, etc., you  skewered into that beef cavern, got cooked to perfection, retaining  their own juices and receiving those of the reeking ox. These he called  his beef-stuffing, and took delight therein, as did now our trio;  for, at his word, seven of his people went headlong, and drove silver  tridents into the steaming cave at random, and speared a kid, a cygnet,  and a flock of wildfowl. These presently smoked before Gerard and  company; and Peter's face, sad and slightly morose at the loss of the  savage hog, expanded and shone. After this, twenty different tarts of  fruits and herbs, and last of all, confectionery on a Titanic scale;  cathedrals of sugar, all gilt painted in the interstices of the  bas-reliefs; castles with moats, and ditches imitated to the life;  elephants, camels, toads; knights on horseback jousting; kings and  princesses looking on trumpeters blowing; and all these personages  eating, and their veins filled with sweet-scented juices: works of art  made to be destroyed. The guests breached a bastion, crunched a crusader  and his horse and lance, or cracked a bishop, cope, chasuble, crosier  and all, as remorselessly as we do a caraway comfit; sipping meanwhile  hippocras and other spiced drinks, and Greek and Corsican wines, while  every now and then little Turkish boys, turbaned, spangled, jewelled,  and gilt, came offering on bended knee golden troughs of rose-water and  orange-water to keep the guests' hands cool and perfumed.    But long before our party arrived at this final stage appetite had  succumbed, and Gerard had suddenly remembered he was the bearer of a  letter to the Princess Marie, and, in an under-tone, had asked one of  the servants if he would undertake to deliver it. The man took it with  a deep obeisance: \"He could not deliver it himself, but would instantly  give it one of the Princess's suite, several of whom were about.\"    It may be remembered that Peter and Margaret came here not to dine, but  to find their cousin. Well, the old gentleman ate heartily, and--being  much fatigued, dropped asleep, and forgot all about his cousin. Margaret  did not remind him; we shall hear why.    Meanwhile, that Cousin was seated within a few feet of them, at their  backs, and discovered them when Margaret turned round and screamed  at the boar. But he forbore to speak to them, for municipal reasons.  Margaret was very plainly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13665"],[0,"War in the Garden of Eden (#5)"],[1,"or eight  years previous, when with my father in Africa, I had learned Swahili, and  although I had forgotten a great deal of it, still I found it a help in  taking up Arabic. Most of the officers had either British or Indian  servants; in the former case they were known as batmen, and in the latter  as bearers; but I decided to follow suit with the minority and get an  Arab, and therefore learn Arabic instead of Hindustanee, for the former  would be of vastly more general use. The town commandant, Captain Grieve  of the Black Watch, after many attempts at length produced a native who  seemed, at any rate, more promising than the others that offered  themselves. Yusuf was a sturdy, rather surly-looking youth of about  eighteen. Evidently not a pure Arab, he claimed various admixtures as the  fancy took him, the general preference being Kurd. I always felt that  there was almost certainly a good percentage of Turk. His father had been  a non-commissioned officer in the Turkish army, and at first I was loath  to take him along on advances and attacks, for he would have been shown  little mercy had he fallen into enemy hands. He was, however, insistent on  asking to go with me, and I never saw him show any concern under fire. He  spoke, in varying degrees of fluency, Kurdish, Persian, and Turkish, and  was of great use to me for that reason. He became by degrees a very  faithful and trustworthy follower, his great weakness being that he was a  one-man's man, and although he would do anything for me, he was of little  general use in an officers' mess.    I had two horses, one a black mare that I called Soda, which means black  in Arabic, and the other a hard-headed bay gelding that was game to go  all day, totally unaffected by shell-fire, but exceedingly stubborn about  choosing the direction in which he went. After numerous changes I came  across an excellent syce to look after them. He was a wild, unkempt  figure, with a long black beard--a dervish by profession, and certainly  gave no one any reason to believe that he was more than half-witted.  Indeed, almost all dervishes are in a greater or less degree insane; it is  probably due to that that they have become dervishes, for the native  regards the insane as under the protection of God. Dervishes go around  practically naked, usually wearing only a few skins flung over the  shoulder, and carrying a large begging-bowl. In addition they carry a  long, sharp, iron bodkin, with a wooden ball at the end, having very much  the appearance of a fool's bauble. They lead an easy life. When they take  a fancy to a house, they settle down near the gate, and the owner has to  support them as long as the whim takes them to stay there. To use force  against a dervish would be looked upon as an exceedingly unpropitious  affair to the true believer. Then, too, I have little doubt but that they  are capable of making good use of their steel bodkins. Why my dervish  wished to give up his easy-going profession and take over the charge of my  horses I never fully determined, but it must have been because he really  loved horses and found that as a dervish pure and simple he had very  little to do with them. When he arrived he was dressed in a very ancient  gunny-sack, and it was not without much regret at the desecration that I  provided him with an outfit of the regulation khaki.    My duties took me on long rides about the country. Here, and throughout  Mesopotamia, the great antiquity of this \"cradle of the world\" kept ever  impressing itself upon one, consciously or subconsciously. Everywhere were  ruins; occasionally a wall still reared itself clear of the all-enveloping  dust, but generally all that remained were great mounds, where the desert  had crept in and claimed its own, covering palace, house, and market,  temple, synagogue, mosque, or church with its everlasting mantle. Often  the streets could still be traced, but oftener not. The weight of ages was  ever present as one rode among the ruins of these once busy, prosperous  cities, now long dead and buried, how long no one knew, for frequently  their very names were forgotten. Babylon, Ur of the Chaldees, Istabulat,  Nineveh, and many more great cities of history are now nothing but names  given to desert mounds.    Close by Samarra stands a strange corkscrew tower, known by the natives as  the Malwiyah. It is about a hundred and sixty feet high, built of brick,  with a path of varying width winding up around the outside. No one knew  its purpose, and estimates of its antiquity varied by several thousand  years. One fairly well-substantiated story told that it had been the  custom to kill prisoners by hurling them off its top. We found it  exceedingly useful as an observation-post. In the same manner we used  Julian's tomb, a great mound rising up in the desert some five or six  miles up-stream of the town. The legend is that when the Roman Emperor  died of his wounds his soldiers, impressing the natives, built this as a  mausoleum; but there is no ground whatever for this belief, for it would  have been physically impossible for a harassed or retreating army to have  performed a task of such magnitude. The natives call it \"The Granary,\" and  claim that that was its original use. Before the war the Germans had  started in excavating, and discovered shafts leading deep down, and on top  the foundations of a palace. Around its foot may be traced roadways and  circular plots, and especially when seen from an aeroplane it looks as if  there had at one time been an elaborate system of gardens.    We were continually getting false rumors about the movements of the Turks.  We had believed that it would be impossible for them to execute a flank  movement, at any rate in sufficient strength to be a serious menace, for  from all the reports we could get, the wells were few and far between.  Nevertheless, there was a great deal of excitement and some concern when  one afternoon our aeroplanes came in with the report that they had seen a  body of Turks that they estimated at from six to eight thousand marching  round our right flank. The plane was sent straight back with instructions  to verify most carefully the statement, and be sure that it was really men  they had seen. They returned at dark with no alteration of their original  report. As can well be imagined, that night was a crowded one for us, and  the feeling ran high when next morning the enemy turned out to be several  enormous herds of sheep.    As part consequence of this we were ordered to make a thorough water  reconnaissance, with a view of ascertaining how large a force could be  watered on a march around our flank. I went off in an armored car with  Captain Marshall of the Intelligence Service. Marshall had spent many  years in Mesopotamia shipping liquorice to the American Tobacco Company,  and he was known and trusted by the Arabs all along the Tigris from Kurna  to Mosul. He spoke the language most fluently, but with an accent that  left no doubt of his Caledonian home. We had with us a couple of old  sheiks, and it was their first ride in an automobile. It was easy to see  that one of them was having difficulty in maintaining his dignity, but I  was not quite sure of the reason until we stopped a moment and he fairly  flew out of the car. It didn't seem possible that a man able to ride  ninety miles at a stretch on a camel, could be made ill by the motion of  an automobile. However, such was the case, and we had great difficulty in  getting him back into the car. We discovered far more wells than we had  been led to believe existed, but not enough to make a flank attack a very  serious menace.    The mirage played all sorts of tricks, and the balloon observers grew to  be very cautious in their assertions. In the early days of the campaign,  at the battle of Shaiba Bund, a friendly mirage saved the British forces  from what would have proved a very serious defeat. Suleiman Askari was  commanding the Turkish forces, and things were faring badly with the  British, when of a sudden to their amazement they found that the Turks  were in full retreat. Their commanders had caught sight of the mirage of  what was merely an ambulance and supply train, but it was so magnified  that they believed it to be a very large body of reinforcements. The  report ran that when Suleiman was told of his mistake, his chagrin was so  great that he committed suicide.    It was at length decided to advance on the Turkish forces at Daur. General  Brooking had just made a most successful attack on the Euphrates front,  capturing the town of Ramadie, with almost five thousand prisoners. It was  believed to be the intention of the army commander to try to relieve the  pressure against General Allenby's forces in Palestine by attacking the  enemy on all three of their Mesopotamian fronts. Accordingly, we were  ordered to march out after sunset one night, prepared to attack the enemy  position at daybreak. During a short halt by the last rays of the setting  sun I caught sight of a number of Mohammedan soldiers prostrating  themselves toward Mecca in their evening prayers, while their Christian or  pagan comrades looked stolidly on. It was late October, and although the  days were still very hot and oppressive, the nights were almost bitterly  cold. A night-march is always a disagreeable business. The head of the  column checks and halts, and those in the rear have no idea whether it is  an involuntary stop for a few minutes, or whether they are to halt for an  hour or more, owing to some complication of orders. So we stood shivering,  and longed for a smoke, but of course that was strictly forbidden, for the  cigarettes of an army would form a very good indication of its whereabouts  on a dark night. All night we marched and halted, and started on again;  the dust choked us, and the hours seemed interminable, until at last at  two in the morning word was passed along that we could"]]]
