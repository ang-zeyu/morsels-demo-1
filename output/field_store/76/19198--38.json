Devotion to him is like loyalty to the national ensign. The  ensign is nothing in itself, but it symbolizes the idea of the State;  and the prince is also the representative of an idea, which he must  continue to represent in its entirety, or he ceases to be the prince.  This lesson Albrecht learns when, like Kleist's _Prince of Homburg_, he  is made judge in his own case, and when he perceives at the cost of what  personal sacrifice his father has done his duty. The State prevails over  Albrecht as it prevails over Agnes, whose only fault was that she did  not immure her beauty in a nunnery.    The sanction of tradition and custom which Albrecht and Agnes could not  break in _Agnes Bernauer_ Hebbel most impressively demonstrated in  _Gyges and his Ring_. Kandaules, King of Lydia, is a rash innovator in  both public and private life. He despises rusty swords and uncomfortable  crowns, he means to do away with silly prejudices, and, like Herod,  regarding his wife as a precious possession only, he procures for his  friend Gyges an opportunity to see her unveiled. But she, an Indian  princess, is, in Christine Hebbel's words, a convolution of veils; her  veil is inseparable from herself; and the brutal violation of her  modesty is a less forgivable crime than the taking of her life would be.  The wearing of a veil may be a foolish custom; but use and want hallow  even the trivial. Half of our law is based upon precedent, and we are  protected at every turn by unwritten law, which is nothing else than  precedent. Mankind needs to repose in the security of this protection.  Woe to him, said Hebbel, who disturbs the sleep of the world! Changes  must come, but rarely in the way of revolution.    The tragedy of the Nibelungen Hebbel approached somewhat differently  from the other subjects that he treated. He had his own conception of  the tragic content of the matter, of course; but he found that the  author of the _Nibelungenlied_, a dramatist from head to foot, has so  clearly presented the tragic aspects of the story that the modern  dramatist need only make himself the interpreter of the medieval epic  poet. Herewith Hebbel's trilogy is at once distinguished from such other  modern treatments of the subject as Geibel's _Brunhild_ or Wagner's  _Nibelungen Ring_. Geibel eliminated everything supernatural; Wagner  made use chiefly of the Old Norse versions of the story; Hebbel, on the  contrary, dramatized what he regarded as the significant content of the  Middle High German poem, retaining its mythological, Christian,  chivalrous, historical, and legendary elements. The mythological  elements of the epic are indeed indistinct survivals of earlier ages.  Hebbel leaned somewhat upon Norse myths in his reproduction of them,  though it was part of his plan to preserve a certain indistinctness and  mystery in these undramatic presuppositions. Similarly, he made more of  the element of Christianity than is made of it by the _Nibelungenlied_.  In both epic and drama the Burgundians are only formally Christian; the  cardinal principles of heathen ethics, tribal loyalty and vengeance, are  entirely unaffected by the Christian doctrine of forgiveness. In the  play, however, the transition from one system to the other is much more  strongly emphasized than in the poem. The heathen ethics lead to the  mutual destruction of those who profess them, and out of the ruins of  the old civilization a new world rises heralded by Theodoric of Verona,  who accepts the sovereignty relinquished by Attila the Hun, \"in His name  who died on the cross.\"    The downfall of two peoples follows in the train of personal calamity.  Siegfried, foreordained by the ancient gods to become the husband of  Brunhild, neglects in the adventurous days of youth to woo her, and  undertakes for the price of Kriemhild's hand to secure her as a wife for  Gunther. Hidden in his cloak of invisibility, he twice overcomes  Brunhild, thereby committing against her the same kind of outrage as  Herod's against Mariamne, and that of Gyges against Rhodope. Through no  direct fault of Siegfried's the fraud is discovered; it is an offense to  the queen, which insults the State. Gunther the king will not punish it,  for he is under personal obligations to the offender; but he takes no  effective measures to prevent punishment by Hagen, who, though his loyal  motives are mixed with envy, acts within his rights as the prime  minister. But Siegfried, being vulnerable in only one spot, cannot be  challenged to open combat; he has to be slain by stealth; so that  Hagen's act is not strictly to be called murder, and the Burgundians,  even though their sense of solidarity should not require them to make  common cause with him against Kriemhild, might with some show of reason  confirm his oath that he is no murderer. Siegfried put himself outside  the pale of humanity when he assumed the dragon's skin. Dragons are  hunted to death. Only men are tried and executed.    We have chosen to examine Hebbel's principal plays from the point of  view of their idea, for the reason that, as said above, it was primarily  the idea which Hebbel found important in every individual phenomenon. He  did not treat cases and conditions for the sake of merely representing  life on the stage, but for the sake of exemplifying, in representations  of life, the fundamental irreconcilability of the expansive and  repressive forces which struggle in every individual. His characters are  certainly persons, not abstract constructions; the action in his plays  moves relentlessly forward, with no lack of inventiveness on his part or  of sensuous impressiveness on the part of his inventions; he seldom  fails to convince our understanding that in his dramatic debate each  side is adequately represented, and that the side which at length  prevails is the stronger under the presuppositions of time and place; it  would be unfair, furthermore, to deny the appeal that he makes to our  sympathy. But, on the other hand, he is not free from suggestions of  artifice; his characters are abnormally introspective and  self-explanatory, and they reveal a talent for logical exposition which  belongs rather to Friedrich Hebbel than to men of like passions with  ourselves. In the unsought, accidental, ingenuous details which  ingratiate themselves in spite, or perhaps because of their  insignificance, he is not to be compared with Grillparzer; nor, in the  capacity to create a poetic atmosphere, with Otto Ludwig. His language  is rugged and masculine; his style, frequently forensic. Taken as a  whole, his work furnishes more abundant food for thought than objects  of _naive_ esthetic enjoyment; but, like Grillparzer's, his plays were  written for the stage; and proper enactment has seldom failed to produce  with them an effect of power worthy of his powerful personality, which  swam against the tide, knowing that the tide would turn and that the  flood would bear him to the haven.           *       *       *       *       *          _FRIEDRICH HEBBEL_           *       *       *       *       *        MARIA MAGDALENA      DRAMATIS PERSONAE    Master ANTONY, _a joiner_    _His Wife_    CLARA, _his daughter_    CARL, _his son_    LEONARD    _A Secretary_ WOLFRAM, a merchant_    ADAM, _a bailiff_    _Another bailiff_    _A Boy_    _A Maid_    _Place.

Your wedding dress? Oh, how well it becomes you! It looks as if it had  been made today!    MOTHER.    Yes, child, fashion keeps on going forward until it can go no farther  and has to turn around and go back. This dress has already been out of  style and in again ten times.    CLARA.    But this time it is not exactly in style, dear mother! The sleeves are  too wide! It must not annoy you!    MOTHER (_smiling_).    I should have to be you for that! CLARA.    And so this is the way you looked! But surely you carried a bunch of  flowers too, didn't you?    MOTHER.    I should hope so! Else why do you think I nursed that sprig of myrtle in  the pot for so many years?    CLARA.    I have often asked you to, but you have never before put it on. You have  always said: It is no longer my wedding dress; it is my shroud now, and  that is something one should not play with. I got so that I couldn't  even look at it any more, because, hanging there so white, it always  made me think of your death, and of the day when the old women would try  to pull it on over your head. Why then today?    MOTHER.    When one is very sick, as I was, and does not know whether one is going  to get well again or not, a great many things revolve in one's head.  Death is more terrible than you think--oh, it is awful! It casts a  shadow over the world; one after the other it blows out all the lights  that shine with such cheerful brightness all around us, the kindly eyes  of husband and children cease to sparkle, and it grows dark everywhere.  But deep in the heart it strikes a light, which burns brightly and  reveals a great deal one does not care to see. I am not conscious of  ever having done a wrong; I have walked in God's ways, I have done my  best about the home, I have brought you and your brother up to fear God,  and I have kept together the fruits of your father's hard work. I have  always managed to lay aside an extra penny for the poor, and if now and  then I have turned somebody away, because I felt out of sorts or because  too many came, it wasn't a very great misfortune for him, because I was  sure to call him back and give him twice as much.

How they got there was a question which had often puzzled me; but having  at length arrived at some conclusions on the subject, I was now desirous  to ascertain, by a more extensive examination of the limestone country,  whether the caves containing the osseous breccia presented here similar  characteristics to those I had observed in Wellington Valley.    OSSEOUS BRECCIA.    The first limestone we examined had no crevices sufficiently large to  admit our bodies; but on riding five miles southward to Oakey creek we  found a low ridge extending some miles on its left bank which promised  many openings. We soon found one which I considered to be of the right  sort, namely a perpendicular crevice with red tuff about the sides. Being  provided with candles and ropes we descended perpendicularly first, about  six fathoms to one stage, then obliquely, about half as far to a sort of  floor of red earth; Mr. Rankin, although a large man, always leading the  way into the smallest openings. By these means and by crawling through  narrow crevices we penetrated to several recesses, until Mr. Rankin found  some masses of osseous breccia beneath the limestone rock but so wedged  in that they could be extracted only by digging. Unlike the same red  substance at Wellington Valley where it was nearly as hard as the  limestone, the red calcareous tuff found here was so loose that the mass  of bones was easily detached from it; but none of them were perfect,  except one or two vertebrae of a very large species of kangaroo. Pursuing  this lode of osseous earth we traced it to several other recesses and in  the lower side of an indurated mass (the upper part having been the floor  of our first landing place) we found two imperfect skulls of Dasyuri, the  teeth being however very well preserved. This was, doubtless, an  unvisited cave; for the natives have an instinctive or superstitious  dread of all such places, and it is not therefore probable that man had  ever before visited that cavern. With all our ropes it cost some of us  trouble to get out of it, after passing two hours in candle-light. It may  thus be imagined what a vast field for such interesting researches  remains still unexplored in that district where limestone occurs in such  abundance.    The objects of my journey did not admit of further indulgence in the  pursuit at that time; and I was content with drawing the attention of one  of the party, a young gentleman residing in the neighbourhood, to it, in  hopes he might discover some bones of importance.*    (*Footnote. See a further account of these caves and some others in  Chapter 3.15 below.)    MOUNT GRANARD, FIRST POINT TO BE ATTAINED.    March 19.    Our stores being completed we proceeded along the course of the little  rivulet of Buree, towards the Lachlan. My first object was to gain Mount  Granard, described by Mr. Oxley as the most elevated pic of a very high  range, and laid down on his map to the westward of where the Lachlan  takes a remarkable turn from its general direction towards the low  country more to the southward. I had long thought that it might be  possible to ascertain from this hill whether any range extended westward  of sufficient magnitude to separate the basins of the Murray and the  Darling. I wished to visit it last year, but the loss of Mr. Cunningham,  the consequent delay of the party, and the adverse nature of my  instructions in regard to my own views, together prevented me. I then saw  that the hills along the line I was now about to follow were favourable  for triangulation; but the greater certainty of finding water in a large  river like the Lachlan was my chief inducement for now moving towards its  banks, as the season was of such unusual drought. On this day's journey I  took for my guidance the bearing of a line drawn on the map from Buree,  as fixed by my former survey, to the mouth of Byrne's creek, as laid down  by Mr. Oxley; and which I supposed to be the same as that which descends  from Buree.    HALT ON A DRY CREEK.    The line guided me tolerably well to where I encamped that night. This  was on a fine-looking plain, within sight of the wooded banks of the  creek; but, on examining the bed of the latter, I could find no water,  although I followed it two miles down. There I arrived at a cattle  station named Toogang, where there was water. It was nothing to the old  hands of the Darling to go only TWO miles for water. We suffered no  inconvenience from this; but it was deplorable to see the bed of what  must in some seasons be a fine little stream so completely dry and dusty.  This day we met with a new species of Psoralea.* At the camp I  ascertained the magnetic variation to be 9 degrees 10 minutes 15 seconds  East, by an observation of the star Beta Centauri.    (*Footnote. A genus chiefly inhabiting the Cape of Good Hope, India, the  Levant and North America, of which no species have before been published  from Australia. I was subsequently fortunate enough to discover two more  species of this genus; which with one as yet unpublished, found by Mr.  Allan Cunningham in 1818 in the rocky islands of Dampier's Archipelago on  the north-west coast, makes the number inhabiting Australia to be 4: all  of which are remarkable for their resemblance to the North American form  of the genus. The species we observed on this occasion was a small  spreading herbaceous plant. P. patens, Lindley manuscripts; herbacea,  pubescens, foliis pinnatim trifoliolatis, foliolis dentatis punctatis  lateralibus oblongis obtusis intermedio ovato obtuso basi cuneato, racemo  pedunculato laxo multifloro foliis multo longiore, bracteis subrotundis  striatis obscure multipunctatis, ramis divaricatis.)    March 20.    We proceeded, crossing the channel near the cattle station where I learnt  that it was joined immediately below by that which I had named King's  creek on my last journey; also that water was abundant in it below the  junction. Some natives joined us and Piper prevailed on one of them to be  our guide, as far as he knew the country. The use of such a guide in  following an unexplored watercourse is that bad places for the carts may  be avoided, and the doubles of the stream cut off by the easiest routes.    BREAK A WHEEL.    In crossing a gully which entered the creek near another station, called  Chilberengaba, we broke a wheel, and though we had travelled only about  seven miles we were obliged to encamp, and remain until the carpenter and  the smith could repair it.    ATTEMPT TO ASCEND MARGA.    In the meantime I set out with the native guide for the summit of Marga,  which proved to be one of my old fixed points. It was about seven miles  south-west of our camp; but after a most fatiguing ascent of two steep  and rocky ridges, during great heat, I was obliged to return without  reaching Marga. At the cattle station we heard of a bullock which had  been left by us in an exhausted state during our last expedition; and we  succeeded in bringing it in, and in laying the yoke on its neck for  another visit to the banks of the Darling; it was fitter than any other  of our working bullocks. I added a second species of Psoralea to that  discovered yesterday, a small graceful plant with racemes of purplish  minute flowers, elevated far above the leaves, and on slender stalks so  tough as to be broken only with some difficulty.*    (*Footnote. P. tenax, Lindley manuscripts; herbacea, depressa, perennis,  glabra, foliis glandulosis palmatim 5-foliolatis, foliolis linearibus vel  lineari-oblongis obtusis, racemis cylindraceis longissime pedunculatis  erectis, leguminibus ovatis scabris glabris.)    March 21.    According to arrangements made with Captain King and Mr. Dunlop, the  King's astronomer at the Parramatta observatory, I halted the party this  day in order to make hourly observations of the barometer, thermometer,  the sky, etc. This plan had been strongly recommended by Sir John  Herschel; and for our present purposes it was most desirable in order  that we might ascertain how far the fluctuations of the atmosphere in two  places so distant as Parramatta and Byrne's creek corresponded in these  simultaneous observations. During our last journey some discrepancies in  the heights determined by the barometer on the Darling led to a suspicion  that the fluctuations at such great distances, in situations so  dissimilar, might vary considerably; and this was now to be ascertained.    THE PARTY IMPEDED BY ROCKS.    March 22.    We continued our journey along the left bank of the creek, but with  considerable difficulty and delay occasioned by the projection of the  rocky escarpment of the above-mentioned extremities of Mount Marga; so  that we had to break away masses of rock and move the carts one by one,  all hands assisting. We at length gained a pleasant tract of land on  which the grass was green and luxuriant in consequence of some partial  rain; and on this place I encamped with the intention of next day  ascending Marga. In the creek we found ponds, deep and clear like canals;  their borders being reedy and their margins green. In these ponds the  natives speared several fishes which had however a muddy flavour. Among  them was one, apparently the eel-fish, caught during my first expedition  in the Namoi and upper Darling.* This circumstance was rather in favour  of the supposition that the streams unite; but still the fish seemed  somewhat different.    (*Footnote. Plotosus tandanus see Volume 1.)    SNAKES.    On this day's journey we saw several large snakes; one, large and black,  was shot while swimming in a pond in the creek; the others were of that  kind named, from the beautifully variegated skin, the carpet snake. The  natives considered the latter very fierce and dangerous, saying it never  ran away but always faced or pursued them. It had in"]]]
