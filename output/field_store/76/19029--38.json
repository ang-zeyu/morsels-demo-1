But if no man in Nottingham dare  win fourscore angels, I will send elsewhere, for there should be men of  mettle somewhere in this land.\"    Then he called up a messenger in whom he placed great trust, and bade  him saddle his horse and make ready to go to Lincoln Town to see whether  he could find anyone there that would do his bidding and win the reward.  So that same morning the messenger started forth upon his errand.    Bright shone the sun upon the dusty highway that led from Nottingham  to Lincoln, stretching away all white over hill and dale. Dusty was the  highway and dusty the throat of the messenger, so that his heart was  glad when he saw before him the Sign of the Blue Boar Inn, when somewhat  more than half his journey was done. The inn looked fair to his eyes,  and the shade of the oak trees that stood around it seemed cool and  pleasant, so he alighted from his horse to rest himself for a time,  calling for a pot of ale to refresh his thirsty throat.    There he saw a party of right jovial fellows seated beneath the  spreading oak that shaded the greensward in front of the door. There  was a tinker, two barefoot friars, and a party of six of the King's  foresters all clad in Lincoln green, and all of them were quaffing  humming ale and singing merry ballads of the good old times. Loud  laughed the foresters, as jests were bandied about between the singing,  and louder laughed the friars, for they were lusty men with beards  that curled like the wool of black rams; but loudest of all laughed the  Tinker, and he sang more sweetly than any of the rest. His bag and his  hammer hung upon a twig of the oak tree, and near by leaned his good  stout cudgel, as thick as his wrist and knotted at the end.    \"Come,\" cried one of the foresters to the tired messenger, \"come join us  for this shot. Ho, landlord! Bring a fresh pot of ale for each man.\"    The messenger was glad enough to sit down along with the others who were  there, for his limbs were weary and the ale was good.    \"Now what news bearest thou so fast?\" quoth one, \"and whither ridest  thou today?\"    The messenger was a chatty soul and loved a bit of gossip dearly;  besides, the pot of ale warmed his heart; so that, settling himself in  an easy corner of the inn bench, while the host leaned upon the doorway  and the hostess stood with her hands beneath her apron, he unfolded his  budget of news with great comfort. He told all from the very first:  how Robin Hood had slain the forester, and how he had hidden in the  greenwood to escape the law; how that he lived therein, all against the  law, God wot, slaying His Majesty's deer and levying toll on fat abbot,  knight, and esquire, so that none dare travel even on broad Watling  Street or the Fosse Way for fear of him; how that the Sheriff had a mind  to serve the King's warrant upon this same rogue, though little would he  mind warrant of either king or sheriff, for he was far from being a  law-abiding man. Then he told how none could be found in all Nottingham  Town to serve this warrant, for fear of cracked pates and broken bones,  and how that he, the messenger, was now upon his way to Lincoln Town to  find of what mettle the Lincoln men might be.    \"Now come I, forsooth, from good Banbury Town,\" said the jolly Tinker,  \"and no one nigh Nottingham--nor Sherwood either, an that be the  mark--can hold cudgel with my grip. Why, lads, did I not meet that mad  wag Simon of Ely, even at the famous fair at Hertford Town, and beat him  in the ring at that place before Sir Robert of Leslie and his lady? This  same Robin Hood, of whom, I wot, I never heard before, is a right merry  blade, but gin he be strong, am not I stronger? And gin he be sly, am  not I slyer? Now by the bright eyes of Nan o' the Mill, and by mine own  name and that's Wat o' the Crabstaff, and by mine own mother's son,  and that's myself, will I, even I, Wat o' the Crabstaff, meet this same  sturdy rogue, and gin he mind not the seal of our glorious sovereign  King Harry, and the warrant of the good Sheriff of Nottinghamshire,  I will so bruise, beat, and bemaul his pate that he shall never move  finger or toe again! Hear ye that, bully boys?\"    \"Now art thou the man for my farthing,\" cried the messenger. \"And back  thou goest with me to Nottingham Town.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth the Tinker, shaking his head slowly from side to side. \"Go  I with no man gin it be not with mine own free will.\"    \"Nay, nay,\" said the messenger, \"no man is there in Nottinghamshire  could make thee go against thy will, thou brave fellow.\"    \"Ay, that be I brave,\" said the Tinker.    \"Ay, marry,\" said the messenger, \"thou art a brave lad; but our good  Sheriff hath offered fourscore angels of bright gold to whosoever shall  serve the warrant upon Robin Hood; though little good will it do.\"    \"Then I will go with thee, lad. Do but wait till I get my bag and  hammer, and my cudgel. Ay, let' me but meet this same Robin Hood, and  let me see whether he will not mind the King's warrant.\" So, after  having paid their score, the messenger, with the Tinker striding beside  his nag, started back to Nottingham again.    One bright morning soon after this time, Robin Hood started off to  Nottingham Town to find what was a-doing there, walking merrily along  the roadside where the grass was sweet with daisies, his eyes wandering  and his thoughts also. His bugle horn hung at his hip and his bow and  arrows at his back, while in his hand he bore a good stout oaken staff,  which he twirled with his fingers as he strolled along.    As thus he walked down a shady lane he saw a tinker coming, trolling a  merry song as he drew nigh. On his back hung his bag and his hammer, and  in his hand he carried a right stout crabstaff full six feet long, and  thus sang he:         \"_In peascod time, when hound to horn       Gives ear till buck be killed,       And little lads with pipes of corn       Sit keeping beasts afield_--\"    \"Halloa, good friend!\" cried Robin.    \"I WENT TO GATHER STRAWBERRIES--\"    \"Halloa!\" cried Robin again.    \"BY WOODS AND GROVES FULL FAIR--\"    \"Halloa! Art thou deaf, man? Good friend, say I!\"    \"And who art thou dost so boldly check a fair song?\" quoth the Tinker,  stopping in his singing. \"Halloa, shine own self, whether thou be good  friend or no. But let me tell thee, thou stout fellow, gin thou be a  good friend it were well for us both; but gin thou be no good friend it  were ill for thee.\"    \"And whence comest thou, my lusty blade?\" quoth Robin.    \"I come from Banbury,\" answered the Tinker.    \"Alas!\" quoth Robin, \"I hear there is sad news this merry morn.\"    \"Ha! Is it indeed so?\" cried the Tinker eagerly. \"Prythee tell it  speedily, for I am a tinker by trade, as thou seest, and as I am in my  trade I am greedy for news, even as a priest is greedy for farthings.\"    \"Well then,\" quoth Robin, \"list thou and I will tell, but bear thyself  up bravely, for the news is sad, I wot. Thus it is: I hear that two  tinkers are in the stocks for drinking ale and beer!\"    \"Now a murrain seize thee and thy news, thou scurvy dog,\" quoth the  Tinker, \"for thou speakest but ill of good men. But sad news it is  indeed, gin there be two stout fellows in the stocks.\"    \"Nay,\" said Robin, \"thou hast missed the mark and dost but weep for the  wrong sow. The sadness of the news lieth in that there be but two in the  stocks, for the others do roam the country at large.\"    \"Now by the pewter platter of Saint Dunstan,\" cried the Tinker, \"I have  a good part of a mind to baste thy hide for thine ill jest. But gin men  be put in the stocks for drinking ale and beer, I trow thou wouldst not  lose thy part.\"    Loud laughed Robin and cried, \"Now well taken, Tinker, well taken! Why,  thy wits are like beer, and do froth up most when they grow sour! But  right art thou, man, for I love ale and beer right well. Therefore come  straightway with me hard by to the Sign of the Blue Boar, and if thou  drinkest as thou appearest--and I wot thou wilt not belie thy looks--I  will drench thy throat with as good homebrewed as ever was tapped in all  broad Nottinghamshire.\"    \"Now by my faith,\" said the Tinker, \"thou art a right good fellow in  spite of thy scurvy jests. I love thee, my sweet chuck, and gin I go not  with thee to that same Blue Boar thou mayst call me a heathen.\"    \"Tell me thy news, good friend, I prythee,\" quoth Robin as they trudged  along together, \"for tinkers, I ween, are all as full of news as an egg  of meat.\"    \"Now I love thee as my brother, my bully blade,\" said the Tinker, \"else  I would not tell thee my news; for sly am I, man, and I have in hand a  grave undertaking that doth call for all my wits, for I come to seek  a bold outlaw that men, hereabouts, call Robin Hood. Within my pouch I  have a warrant, all fairly written out on parchment, forsooth, with a  great red seal for to make it lawful. Could I but meet this same Robin  Hood I would serve it upon his dainty body, and if he minded it not  I would beat him till every one of his ribs would cry Amen. But thou  livest hereabouts, mayhap thou knowest Robin Hood thyself, good fellow.\"    \"Ay, marry, that I do somewhat,\" quoth Robin, \"and I have seen him this  very morn. But, Tinker, men say that he is but a sad, sly thief. Thou  hadst better watch thy warrant, man, or else he may steal it out of thy  very pouch.\"    \"Let him but try!\" cried the Tinker. \"Sly may he be, but sly am I, too.  I would I had him here now, man to man!\" And he made his heavy cudgel to  spin again. \"But what manner of man is he, lad?    \"Much like myself,\" said Robin, laughing, \"and in height and build"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965"],[0,"The Black Tulip (#4)"],[1," lives at Dort.\"    \"Poor honest Van Baerle! who knows so much, and yet thinks of nothing  but of flowers and of God who made them. You have intrusted him with  this fatal secret; it will be his ruin, poor soul!\"    \"His ruin?\"    \"Yes, for he will either be strong or he will be weak. If he is  strong, he will, when he hears of what has happened to us, boast of  our acquaintance; if he is weak, he will be afraid on account of his  connection with us: if he is strong, he will betray the secret by his  boldness; if he is weak, he will allow it to be forced from him. In  either case he is lost, and so are we. Let us, therefore, fly, fly, as  long as there is still time.\"    Cornelius de Witt, raising himself on his couch, and grasping the  hand of his brother, who shuddered at the touch of his linen bandages,  replied,--    \"Do not I know my godson? have not I been enabled to read every thought  in Van Baerle's mind, and every sentiment in his heart? You ask whether  he is strong or weak. He is neither the one nor the other; but that is  not now the question. The principal point is, that he is sure not to  divulge the secret, for the very good reason that he does not know it  himself.\"    John turned round in surprise.    \"You must know, my dear brother, that I have been trained in the school  of that distinguished politician John de Witt; and I repeat to you,  that Van Baerle is not aware of the nature and importance of the deposit  which I have intrusted to him.\"    \"Quick then,\" cried John, \"as there is still time, let us convey to him  directions to burn the parcel.\"    \"Through whom?\"    \"Through my servant Craeke, who was to have accompanied us on horseback,  and who has entered the prison with me, to assist you downstairs.\"    \"Consider well before having those precious documents burnt, John!\"    \"I consider, above all things, that the brothers De Witt must  necessarily save their lives, to be able to save their character. If  we are dead, who will defend us? Who will have fully understood our  intentions?\"    \"You expect, then, that they would kill us if those papers were found?\"    John, without answering, pointed with his hand to the square, whence, at  that very moment, fierce shouts and savage yells made themselves heard.    \"Yes, yes,\" said Cornelius, \"I hear these shouts very plainly, but what  is their meaning?\"    John opened the window.    \"Death to the traitors!\" howled the populace.    \"Do you hear now, Cornelius?\"    \"To the traitors! that means us!\" said the prisoner, raising his eyes to  heaven and shrugging his shoulders.    \"Yes, it means us,\" repeated John.    \"Where is Craeke?\"    \"At the door of your cell, I suppose.\"    \"Let him enter then.\"    John opened the door; the faithful servant was waiting on the threshold.    \"Come in, Craeke, and mind well what my brother will tell you.\"    \"No, John; it will not suffice to send a verbal message; unfortunately,  I shall be obliged to write.\"    \"And why that?\"    \"Because Van Baerle will neither give up the parcel nor burn it without  a special command to do so.\"    \"But will you be able to write, poor old fellow?\" John asked, with a  look on the scorched and bruised hands of the unfortunate sufferer.    \"If I had pen and ink you would soon see,\" said Cornelius.    \"Here is a pencil, at any rate.\"    \"Have you any paper? for they have left me nothing.\"    \"Here, take this Bible, and tear out the fly-leaf.\"    \"Very well, that will do.\"    \"But your writing will be illegible.\"    \"Just leave me alone for that,\" said Cornelius. \"The executioners have  indeed pinched me badly enough, but my hand will not tremble once in  tracing the few lines which are requisite.\"    And really Cornelius took the pencil and began to write, when through  the white linen bandages drops of blood oozed out which the pressure of  the fingers against the pencil squeezed from the raw flesh.    A cold sweat stood on the brow of the Grand Pensionary.    Cornelius wrote:--    \"My dear Godson,--    \"Burn the parcel which I have intrusted to you. Burn it without looking  at it, and without opening it, so that its contents may for ever remain  unknown to yourself. Secrets of this description are death to those  with whom they are deposited. Burn it, and you will have saved John and  Cornelius de Witt.    \"Farewell, and love me.    \"Cornelius de Witt    \"August 20th, 1672.\"    John, with tears in his eyes, wiped off a drop of the noble blood which  had soiled the leaf, and, after having handed the despatch to Craeke  with a last direction, returned to Cornelius, who seemed overcome by  intense pain, and near fainting.    \"Now,\" said he, \"when honest Craeke sounds his coxswain's whistle, it  will be a signal of his being clear of the crowd, and of his having  reached the other side of the pond. And then it will be our turn to  depart.\"    Five minutes had not elapsed, before a long and shrill whistle was heard  through the din and noise of the square of the Buytenhof.    John gratefully raised his eyes to heaven.    \"And now,\" said he, \"let us off, Cornelius.\"          Chapter 3. The Pupil of John de Witt      Whilst the clamour of the crowd in the square of Buytenhof, which grew  more and more menacing against the two brothers, determined John de  Witt to hasten the departure of his brother Cornelius, a deputation of  burghers had gone to the Town-hall to demand the withdrawal of Tilly's  horse.    It was not far from the Buytenhof to Hoogstraet (High Street); and a  stranger, who since the beginning of this scene had watched all its  incidents with intense interest, was seen to wend his way with, or  rather in the wake of, the others towards the Town-hall, to hear as soon  as possible the current news of the hour.    This stranger was a very young man, of scarcely twenty-two or three,  with nothing about him that bespoke any great energy. He evidently had  his good reasons for not making himself known, as he hid his face in a  handkerchief of fine Frisian linen, with which he incessantly wiped his  brow or his burning lips.    With an eye keen as that of a bird of prey,--with a long aquiline nose,  a finely cut mouth, which he generally kept open, or rather which was  gaping like the edges of a wound,--this man would have presented to  Lavater, if Lavater had lived at that time, a subject for physiognomical  observations which at the first blush would not have been very  favourable to the person in question.    \"What difference is there between the figure of the conqueror and that  of the pirate?\" said the ancients. The difference only between the eagle  and the vulture,--serenity or restlessness.    And indeed the sallow physiognomy, the thin and sickly body, and the  prowling ways of the stranger, were the very type of a suspecting  master, or an unquiet thief; and a police officer would certainly have  decided in favour of the latter supposition, on account of the great  care which the mysterious person evidently took to hide himself.    He was plainly dressed, and apparently unarmed; his arm was lean but  wiry, and his hands dry, but of an aristocratic whiteness and delicacy,  and he leaned on the shoulder of an officer, who, with his hand on his  sword, had watched the scenes in the Buytenhof with eager curiosity,  very natural in a military man, until his companion drew him away with  him.    On arriving at the square of the Hoogstraet, the man with the sallow  face pushed the other behind an open shutter, from which corner he  himself began to survey the balcony of the Town-hall.    At the savage yells of the mob, the window of the Town-hall opened, and  a man came forth to address the people.    \"Who is that on the balcony?\" asked the young man, glancing at the  orator.    \"It is the Deputy Bowelt,\" replied the officer.    \"What sort of a man is he? Do you know anything of him?\"    \"An honest man; at least I believe so, Monseigneur.\"    Hearing this character given of Bowelt, the young man showed signs  of such a strange disappointment and evident dissatisfaction that the  officer could not but remark it, and therefore added,--    \"At least people say so, Monseigneur. I cannot say anything about it  myself, as I have no personal acquaintance with Mynheer Bowelt.\"    \"An honest man,\" repeated he who was addressed as Monseigneur; \"do  you mean to say that he is an honest man (brave homme), or a brave one  (homme brave)?\"    \"Ah, Monseigneur must excuse me; I would not presume to draw such a fine  distinction in the case of a man whom, I assure your Highness once more,  I know only by sight.\"    \"If this Bowelt is an honest man,\" his Highness continued, \"he will give  to the demand of these furibund petitioners a very queer reception.\"    The nervous quiver of his hand, which moved on the shoulder of his  companion as the fingers of a player on the keys of a harpsichord,  betrayed his burning impatience, so ill concealed at certain times, and  particularly at that moment, under the icy and sombre expression of his  face.    The chief of the deputation of the burghers was then heard addressing  an interpellation to Mynheer Bowelt, whom he requested to let them know  where the other deputies, his colleagues, were.    \"Gentlemen,\" Bowelt repeated for the second time, \"I assure you that in  this moment I am here alone with Mynheer d'Asperen, and I cannot take  any resolution on my own responsibility.\"    \"The order! we want the order!\" cried several thousand voices.    Mynheer Bowelt wished to speak, but his words were not heard, and he was  only seen moving his arms in all sorts of gestures, which plainly showed  that he felt his position to be desperate. When, at last, he saw that he  could not make himself heard, he turned round towards the open window,  and called Mynheer d'Asperen.    The latter gentleman now made his appearance on the balcony, where he  was saluted with shouts even more energetic than those with which, ten  minutes before, his colleague had been"]]]
