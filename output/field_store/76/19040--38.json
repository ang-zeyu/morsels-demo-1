She put off  the playful overtures of her two bright boys with unusual  indifference, and turned to her husband with anxious questioning as to  whether the strangers brought news of Indians. Upon being assured that  such was not the case, she looked relieved, and explained to Helen  that she had seen armed men come so often to consult the colonel  regarding dangerous missions and expeditions, that the sight of a  stranger caused her unspeakable dread.    \"I am accustomed to danger, yet I can never control my fears for my  husband and children,\" said Mrs. Zane. \"The older I grow the more of a  coward I am. Oh! this border life is sad for women. Only a little  while ago my brother Samuel McColloch was shot and scalped right here  on the river bank. He was going to the spring for a bucket of water. I  lost another brother in almost the same way. Every day during the  summer a husband and a father fall victim to some murderous Indian. My  husband will go in the same way some day. The border claims them all.\"    \"Bessie, you must not show your fears to our new friend. And, Miss  Helen, don't believe she's the coward she would make out,\" said the  colonel's sister smilingly.    \"Betty is right, Bess, don't frighten her,\" said Colonel Zane. \"I'm  afraid I talked too much to-day. But, Miss Helen, you were so  interested, and are such a good listener, that I couldn't refrain.  Once for all let me say that you will no doubt see stirring life here;  but there is little danger of its affecting you. To be sure I think  you'll have troubles; but not with Indians or outlaws.\"    He winked at his wife and sister. At first Helen did not understand  his sally, but then she blushed red all over her fair face.    Some time after that, while unpacking her belongings, she heard the  clatter of horses' hoofs on the rocky road, accompanied by loud  voices. Running to the window, she saw a group of men at the gate.    \"Miss Sheppard, will you come out?\" called Colonel Zane's sister from  the door. \"My brother Jonathan has returned.\"    Helen joined Betty at the door, and looked over her shoulder.    \"Wal, Jack, ye got two on 'em, anyways,\" drawled a voice which she  recognized as that of Elsing's.    A man, lithe and supple, slipped from the back of one of the horses,  and, giving the halter to Elsing with a single word, turned and  entered the gate. Colonel Zane met him there.    \"Well, Jonathan, what's up?\"    \"There's hell to pay,\" was the reply, and the speaker's voice rang  clear and sharp.    Colonel Zane laid his hand on his brother's shoulder, and thus they  stood for a moment, singularly alike, and yet the sturdy pioneer was,  somehow, far different from the dark-haired borderman.    \"I thought we'd trouble in store from the look on your face,\" said the  colonel calmly. \"I hope you haven't very bad news on the first day,  for our old friends from Virginia.\"    \"Jonathan,\" cried Betty when he did not answer the colonel. At her  call he half turned, and his dark eyes, steady, strained like those of  a watching deer, sought his sister's face.    \"Betty, old Jake Lane was murdered by horse thieves yesterday, and  Mabel Lane is gone.\"    \"Oh!\" gasped Betty; but she said nothing more.    Colonel Zane cursed inaudibly.    \"You know, Eb, I tried to keep Lane in the settlement for Mabel's  sake. But he wanted to work that farm. I believe horse-stealing wasn't  as much of an object as the girl. Pretty women are bad for the border,  or any other place, I guess. Wetzel has taken the trail, and I came in  because I've serious suspicions--I'll explain to you alone.\"    The borderman bowed gravely to Helen, with a natural grace, and yet a  manner that sat awkwardly upon him. The girl, slightly flushed, and  somewhat confused by this meeting with the man around whom her  romantic imagination had already woven a story, stood in the doorway  after giving him a fleeting glance, the fairest, sweetest picture of  girlish beauty ever seen.    The men went into the house; but their voices came distinctly through  the door.    \"Eb, if Bing Legget or Girty ever see that big-eyed lass, they'll have  her even if Fort Henry has to be burned, an' in case they do get her,  Wetzel an' I'll have taken our last trail.\"          CHAPTER III    Supper over, Colonel Zane led his guests to a side porch, where they  were soon joined by Mrs. Zane and Betty. The host's two boys, Noah and  Sammy, who had preceded them, were now astride the porch-rail and, to  judge by their antics, were riding wild Indian mustangs.    \"It's quite cool,\" said Colonel Zane; \"but I want you to see the  sunset in the valley. A good many of your future neighbors may come  over to-night for a word of welcome. It's the border custom.\"    He was about to seat himself by the side of Mr. Sheppard, on a rustic  bench, when a Negro maid appeared in the doorway carrying a smiling,  black-eyed baby. Colonel Zane took the child and, holding it aloft,  said with fatherly pride:    \"This is Rebecca Zane, the first girl baby born to the Zanes, and  destined to be the belle of the border.\"    \"May I have her?\" asked Helen softly, holding out her arms. She took  the child, and placed it upon her knee where its look of solemnity  soon changed to one of infantile delight.    \"Here come Nell and Jim,\" said Mrs. Zane, pointing toward the fort.    \"Yes, and there comes my brother Silas with his wife, too,\" added  Colonel Zane. \"The first couple are James Douns, our young minister,  and Nell, his wife. They came out here a year or so ago. James had a  brother Joe, the finest young fellow who ever caught the border fever.  He was killed by one of the Girtys. His was a wonderful story, and  some day you shall hear about the parson and his wife.\"    \"What's the border fever?\" asked Mr. Sheppard.    \"It's what brought you out here,\" replied Colonel Zane with a hearty  laugh.    Helen gazed with interest at the couple now coming into the yard, and  when they gained the porch she saw that the man was big and tall, with  a frank, manly bearing, while his wife was a slender little woman with  bright, sunny hair, and a sweet, smiling face. They greeted Helen and  her father cordially.    Next came Silas Zane, a typical bronzed and bearded pioneer, with his  buxom wife. Presently a little group of villagers joined the party.  They were rugged men, clad in faded buckskins, and sober-faced women  who wore dresses of plain gray linsey. They welcomed the newcomers  with simple, homely courtesy. Then six young frontiersmen appeared  from around a corner of the cabin, advancing hesitatingly. To Helen  they all looked alike, tall, awkward, with brown faces and big hands.  When Colonel Zane cheerily cried out to them, they stumbled forward  with evident embarrassment, each literally crushing Helen's hand in  his horny palm. Afterward they leaned on the rail and stole glances  at her.    Soon a large number of villagers were on the porch or in the yard.  After paying their respects to Helen and her father they took part in  a general conversation. Two or three girls, the latest callers, were  surrounded by half a dozen young fellows, and their laughter sounded  high above the hum of voices.    Helen gazed upon this company with mingled feelings of relief and  pleasure. She had been more concerned regarding the young people with  whom her lot might be cast, than the dangers of which others had told.  She knew that on the border there was no distinction of rank. Though  she came of an old family, and, during her girlhood, had been  surrounded by refinement, even luxury, she had accepted cheerfully the  reverses of fortune, and was determined to curb the pride which had  been hers. It was necessary she should have friends. Warm-hearted,  impulsive and loving, she needed to have around her those in whom she  could confide. Therefore it was with sincere pleasure she understood  how groundless were her fears and knew that if she did not find good,  true friends the fault would be her own. She saw at a glance that the  colonel's widowed sister was her equal, perhaps her superior, in  education and breeding, while Nellie Douns was as well-bred and  gracious a little lady as she had ever met. Then, the other girls,  too, were charming, with frank wholesomeness and freedom.    Concerning the young men, of whom there were about a dozen, Helen had  hardly arrived at a conclusion. She liked the ruggedness, the signs of  honest worth which clung to them. Despite her youth, she had been much  sought after because of her personal attractions, and had thus added  experience to the natural keen intuition all women possess. The  glances of several of the men, particularly the bold regard of one  Roger Brandt, whom Colonel Zane introduced, she had seen before, and  learned to dislike. On the whole, however, she was delighted with the  prospect of new friends and future prosperity, and she felt even  greater pleasure in the certainty that her father shared her  gratification.    Suddenly she became aware that the conversation had ceased. She looked  up to see the tall, lithe form of Jonathan Zane as he strode across  the porch. She could see that a certain constraint had momentarily  fallen upon the company. It was an involuntary acknowledgment of the  borderman's presence, of a presence that worked on all alike with a  subtle, strong magnetism.    \"Ah, Jonathan, come out to see the sunset? It's unusually fine  to-night,\" said Colonel Zane.    With hardly more than a perceptible bow to those present, the  borderman took a seat near the rail, and, leaning upon it, directed  his gaze westward.    Helen sat so near she could have touched him. She was conscious of the  same strange feeling, and impelling sense of power, which had come  upon her so strongly at first sight of him. More than that, a lively  interest had been aroused in her.

Volume 1: Essentials of Cookery; Cereals; (#4)"],[1," food  selection, therefore, the characteristics of the various food substances  must be considered well. Fats yield the most heat, but are the most  slowly digested. Proteins and carbohydrates are more quickly digested  than fats, but, in equal amounts, have less than half as much food  value. Water and mineral salts do not yield heat, but are required to  build tissue and to keep the body in a healthy condition. In addition,  it is well to note that a well-balanced diet is one that contains all of  the five food substances in just the right proportion in which the  individual needs them to build up the body, repair it, and supply it  with energy. What this proportion should be, however, cannot be stated  offhand, because the quantity and kind of food substances necessarily  vary with the size, age, and activity of each person.      FOOD VALUE    22. Nearly all foods are complex substances, and they differ from one  another in what is known as their _value_, which is measured by the work  the food does in the body either as a tissue builder or as a producer of  energy. However, in considering food value, the person who prepares food  must not lose sight of the fact that the individual appetite must be  appealed to by a sufficient variety of appetizing foods. There would be  neither economy nor advantage in serving food that does not please those  who are to eat it.    While all foods supply the body with energy, they differ very much in  the quantity they yield. If certain ones were chosen solely for that  purpose, it would be necessary for any ordinary person to consume a  larger quantity of them than could be eaten at any one time. For  instance, green vegetables furnish the body with a certain amount of  energy, but they cannot be eaten to the exclusion of other things,  because no person could eat in a day a sufficient amount of them to give  the body all the energy it would need for that day's work. On the other  hand, certain foods produce principally building material, and if they  were taken for the purpose of yielding only energy, they would be much  too expensive. Meats, for example, build up the body, but a person's  diet would cost too much if meat alone were depended on to provide the  body with all the energy it requires. Many foods, too, contain mineral  salts, which, as has been pointed out, are needed for building tissue  and keeping the body in a healthy condition.    23. To come to a correct appreciation of the value of different foods,  it is necessary to understand the unit employed to measure the amount of  work that foods do in the body. This unit is the CALORIE, or _calory_,  and it is used to measure foods just as the inch, the yard, the pound,  the pint, and the quart are the units used to measure materials and  liquids; however, instead of measuring the food itself, it determines  its food value, or fuel value. To illustrate what is meant, consider,  for instance, 1/2 ounce of sugar and 1/2 ounce of butter. As far as the  actual weight of these two foods is concerned, they are equal; but with  regard to the work they do in the body they differ considerably. Their  relative value in the body, however, can be determined if they are  measured by some unit that can be applied to both. It is definitely  known that both of them produce heat when they are oxidized, that is,  when they are combined with oxygen; thus, the logical way of measuring  them is to determine the quantity of heat that will be produced when  they are eaten and united with oxygen, a process that causes the  liberation of heat. The calorie is the unit by which this heat can be  measured, it being the quantity of heat required to raise the  temperature of 1 pint of water 4 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the name  of the thermometer commonly used in the home. When burned as fuel, a  square of butter weighing 1/2 ounce produces enough heat to raise 1 pint  of water 400 degrees Fahrenheit, and it will yield the same amount of  heat when it is eaten and goes through the slow process of oxidation in  the body. On the other hand, 1/2 ounce of sugar upon being oxidized will  produce only enough heat to raise the temperature of 1 pint of water  about 230 degrees Fahrenheit. Thus, as will be seen, 1/2 ounce of butter  has a value of approximately 100 calories, whereas 1/2 ounce of sugar  contains only about 57-1/2 calories.    Other foods yield heat in varying degrees, and their food value is  determined in exactly the same way as that of butter and sugar. To give  an idea of the composition of various food materials, as well as the  number of calories that 1 pound of these food materials will yield, food  charts published by the United States Department of Agriculture are here  presented. As an understanding of these charts will prove extremely  profitable in the selection of food, a careful study of them at this  time is urged. In addition, reference to them should be made from time  to time as the various kinds of foods are taken up, as the charts will  then be more easily comprehended and their contents of more value.      DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION OF FOOD    24. The third requirement in the selection of food, namely, its  digestion and absorption, depends considerably on the persons who are to  be fed. Food that is chosen for adults entirely would not be the same as  that intended for both young persons and adults; neither would food that  is to be fed to children or persons who are ill be the same as that  which is to be served to robust adults who do a normal amount of work.  No hard-and-fast rules can be laid down here for this phase of  food selection, but as these lessons in cookery are taken up in turn,  the necessary knowledge regarding digestibility will be acquired.    [Illustration: Composition of food materials]    [Illustration: Composition of food materials]           *       *       *       *       *    PREPARATION OF FOOD    REASONS FOR COOKING FOOD    25. The term cookery, as has been explained, means the preparation of  both hot and cold dishes for use as food, as well as the selection of  the materials or substances that are to be cooked. The importance of  cooking foods by subjecting them to the action of heat has been  recognized for ages; and while it is true that there are many foods that  appeal to the appetite in their raw state and still others that can be  eaten either raw or cooked, there are several reasons why it is  desirable to cook food, as will be seen from the following:    1. Cooking makes foods more palatable. This is true of such foods as  meat, cereals, and many vegetables, which would be very unappetizing if  they were eaten raw.    2. Cooking renders foods more digestible. For instance, the hard grains,  such as wheat, and the dried vegetables, such as beans, cannot be  readily digested unless they are softened by cooking. But while cooking  makes such foods more digestible, it renders others more difficult of  digestion, as in the case of eggs, the degree of digestibility depending  somewhat on the cooking method used and the skill of the cook. An egg in  an almost liquid form, or when only slightly cooked, as a soft-boiled  egg, is more easily digested than when it becomes hardened by cooking.  Then, too, a properly prepared hard-cooked egg is more digestible than  an improperly cooked one, although the degree of hardness may be  the same.    3. Cooking gives foods greater variety. The same food may be cooked by  various methods and be given very different tastes and appearances; on  the other hand, it may be combined with a large number of other foods,  so as to increase the variety of the dishes in which it is used. The  large number of recipes found in cook books show the attempts that have  been made to obtain variety in cooked dishes by the combining of  different foods.    4. Cooking sterilizes foods either partly or completely. Many foods  need partial or complete sterilization for safety. They must be  completely sterilized if the germs that produce fermentation or  putrefaction and thereby spoil food would be destroyed. This is done  when fruits and vegetables are canned for keeping. Foods that are  exposed to dust, flies, and improper handling should be thoroughly  cooked in order to destroy any pathogenic germs that might be present.  By such germs are meant disease-bearing germs. They differ from germs  that produce fermentation and putrefaction, or spoiling, and that must  in general be considered as a help, for these play an important part in  the raising of bread and the preparation of various foods, as is pointed  out later.    5. Cooking develops flavor in many foods. In the case of some  vegetables, the flavoring substance is given off in the air by certain  methods of cooking and a better flavor is thereby developed.           *       *       *       *       *    METHODS OF COOKING    COOKING PROCESSES    26. Food is cooked by the application of heat, which may be either moist  or dry. While it is true that the art of cooking includes the  preparation of material that is served or eaten raw, cooking itself is  impossible without heat; indeed, the part of cooking that requires the  most skill and experience is that in which heat is involved. Explicit  directions for carrying on the various cooking processes depend on the  kind of stove, the cooking utensils, and even the atmospheric  conditions. In truth, the results of some processes depend so much on  the state of the atmosphere that they are not successful on a day on  which it is damp and heavy; also, as is well known, the stove acts  perfectly on some days, whereas on other days it seems to have a  stubborn will of its own. Besides the difficulties mentioned, the heat  itself sometimes presents obstacles in the cooking of foods, to regulate  it in such a way as to keep it uniform being often a hard matter. Thus,  a dish may be spoiled by subjecting it to heat that is too intense, by  cooking it too long, or by"]]]
