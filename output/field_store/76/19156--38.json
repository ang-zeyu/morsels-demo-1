[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12297"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#5)"],[1," so busy attending his master's  farm that there was no time for him to attend to a little farm that he  was allowed to have. He overcame this handicap, however, by setting up  huge scaffolds in the field which he burned and from the flames that  this fire emitted he could see well enough to do what was necessary to  his farm.    The master's first wife was a very kind woman; at her death Mary's  master moved from Pensacola to Columbia County.    Mary was very active with the plow, she could handle it with the agility  of a man. This prowess gained her the title of \"plow girl.\"      COOKING.    Stoves were unknown and cooking was done in a fireplace that was built  of clay, a large iron rod was built in across the opening of the  fireplace on which were hung pots that had special handles that fitted  about the rod holding them in place over the blazing fire as the food  cooking was done in a moveable oven which was placed in the fireplace  over hot coals or corn cobs. Potatoes were roasted in ashes. Oft' times  Mary's father would sit in front of the fireplace until a late hour in  the night and on arising in the morning the children would find in a  corner a number of roasted potatoes which their father had thoughtfully  roasted and which the children readily consumed.      LIGHTING SYSTEM.    Matches were unknown; a flint rock and a file provided the fire. This  occured by striking a file against a flint rock which threw off sparks  that fell into a wad of dry cotton used for the purpose. This cotton, as  a rule, readily caught fire. This was fire and all the fire needed to  start any blaze.      WEAVING.    The white folk wove the cloth on regular looms which were made into  dresses for the slaves. For various colors of cloth the thread was dyed.  The dye was made by digging up red shank and wild indigo roots which  were boiled. The substance obtained being some of the best dye to be  found.      BEVERAGES & FOOD.    Bread was made from flour and wheat. The meat used was pork, beef,  mutton and goat. For preservation it was smoked and kept in the  smokehouse. Coffee was used as a beverage and when this ran out as oft'  times happened, parched peanuts were used for the purpose.    Mary and family arose before daybreak and prepared breakfast for the  master and his family, after which they ate in the same dining room.  When this was over the dishes were washed by Mary, her brother and  sister. The children then played about until meals were served again.      WASHING and SOAP.    Washing was done in home-made wooden tubs, and boiling in iron pots  similar to those of today. Soap was made from fat and lye.      AMUSEMENTS.    The only amusement to be had was a big candy pulling, or hog killing and  chicken cooking. The slaves from the surrounding plantations were  allowed to come together on these occasions. A big time was had.      CHURCH.    The slaves went to the \"white folks\" church on Sundays. They were seated  in the rear of the church. The white minister would arise and exhort the  slaves to 'mind your masters, you owe them your respect.' An old  Christian slave who perceived things differently could sometimes be  heard to mumble, \"Yeah, wese jest as good as deys is only deys white and  we's black, huh.\" She dare not let the whites hear this. At times  meetin's were held in a slave cabin where some \"inspired\" slave led the  services.    In the course of years Mr. Jamison married again. His second wife was a  veritable terror. She was always ready and anxious to whip a slave for  the least misdemeanor. The master told Mary and her mother that before  he would take the chance of them running away on account of her meanness  he would leave her. As soon as he would leave the house this was a  signal for his wife to start on a slave. One day, with a kettle of hot  water in her hand, she chased Mary, who ran to another plantation and  hid there until the good master returned. She then poured out her  troubles to him. He was very indignant and remonstrated with his wife  for being so cruel. She met her fate in later years; her son-in-law  becoming angry at some of her doings in regard to him shot her, which  resulted in her death. Instead of mourning, everybody seemed to rejoice,  for the menace to well being had been removed. Twice a year Mary's  father and master went to Cedar Keys, Florida to get salt. Ocean water  was obtained and boiled, salt resulting. They always returned with about  three barrels of salt.    The greatest event in the life of a slave was about to occur, and the  most sorrowful in the life of a master, FREEDOM was at hand. A Negro was  seen coming in the distance, mounted upon a mule, approaching Mr.  Jamison who stood upon the porch. He told him of the liberation of the  slaves. Mr. Jamison had never before been heard to curse, but this was  one day that he let go a torrent of words that are unworthy to appear in  print. He then broke down and cried like a slave who was being lashed by  his cruel master. He called Mary's mother and father, Phyliss and Sandy,  \"I ain't got no more to do with you, you are free,\" he said, \"if you  want to stay with me you may and I'll give you one-third of what you  raise.\" They decided to stay. When the crop was harvested the master did  not do as he had promised. He gave them nothing. Mary slipped away,  mounted the old mule \"Mustang\" and galloped away at a mules snail speed  to Newnansville where she related what had happened to a Union captain.  He gave her a letter to give to Mr. Jamison. In it he reminded him that  if he didn't give Mary's family what he had promised he would be put in  jail. Without hesitation the old master complied with these pungent  orders.    After this incident Mary and her family left the good old boss to seek a  new abode in other parts. This was the first time that the master had in  any way displayed any kind of unfairness toward them, perhaps it was the  reaction to having to liberate them.      MARRIAGE.    There was no marriage during slavery according to civil or religious  custom among the slaves. If a slave saw a woman whom he desired he told  his master. If the woman in question belonged on another plantation, the  master would consult her master: \"one of my boys wants to marry one of  your gals,\" he would say. As a rule it was agreeable that they should  live together as man and wife. This was encouraged for it increased the  slave population by new borns, hence, being an asset to the masters.  The two slaves thus joined were allowed to see one another at intervals  upon special permission from the master. He must have a pass to leave  the plantation. Any slave caught without one while off the plantation  was subject to be caught by the \"paderollers\" (a low class of white who  roved the country to molest a slave at the least opportunity. Some of  them were hired by the masters to guard against slaves running away or  to apprehend them in the event that they did) who would beat them  unmercifully, and send them back to the plantation from whence they  came.    As a result of this form of matrimony at emancipation there were no  slaves lawfully married. Orders were given that if they preferred to  live together as man and wife they must marry according to law. They  were given nine months to decide this question, after which if they  continued to live together they were arrested for adultery. A Mr. Fryer,  Justice of the Peace at Gainesville, was assigned to deal with the  situation around the plantation where Mary and her family lived. A big  supper was given, it was early, about twenty-five slave couples  attended. There was gaiety and laughter. A barrel of lemonade was  served. A big time was had by all, then those couples who desired to  remain together were joined in wedlock according to civil custom. The  party broke up in the early hours of the morning.    Mary Biddie, cognizant of the progress that science and invention has  made in the intervening years from Emancipation and the present time,  could not help but remark of the vast improvement of the lighting system  of today and that of slavery. There were no lamps or kerosene. The first  thread that shearer spun was for a wick to be used in a candle, the only  means of light. Beef tallow was used to make the candle; this was placed  in a candle mould while hot. The wick was then placed in the center of  the tallow as it rest in the mould; this was allowed to cool. When this  chemical process occured there was a regular sized candle to be used  for lighting.    Mary now past the century mark, her lean bronze body resting in a  rocker, her head wrapped in a white 'kerchief, and puffing slowly on her  clay pipe, expressed herself in regard to presidents: \"Roosevelt has  don' mo' than any other president, why you know ever since freedom they  been talkin' 'bout dis pension, talkin' 'bout it tha's all, but you see  Mr. Roosevelt he don' com' an' gived it tu us. What? I'll say he's a  good rightus man, an' um sho' go' vot' fo' him.\"    Residing in her little cabin in Eatonville, Florida, she is able to  smile because she has some means of security, the Old Age Pension.          DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA, FOLKLORE  Ex-Slaves    REV. ELI BOYD      Reverend Eli Boyd was born May 29, 1864, four miles from Somerville,  South Carolina on John Murray's plantation. It was a large plantation  with perhaps one hundred slaves and their families. As he was only a  tiny baby when freedom came, he had no \"recomembrance\" of the real  slavery days, but he lived on the same plantation for many years until  his father and mother died in 1888.    \"I worked on the plantation just like they did in the real slavery days,  only I received a small wage. I picked cotton and thinned rice. I always  did just what they told me to do and didn't ever get into any trouble,  except once and that was my own fault.    \"You see it was this way.

Ordinarily where the length of the test specimen is not greater  than four diameters and the ends are squarely faced (see Fig.  7), the force acts uniformly over each square inch of area and  the crushing strength is equal to the maximum load (P) divided                                        {      P  }  by the area of the cross-section (A). { C = --- }                                        {      A  }    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Endwise compression of a short column.]    It has been demonstrated[4] that the ultimate strength in  compression parallel to the grain is very nearly the same as the  extreme fibre stress at the elastic limit in bending. (See Table  V.) In other words, the transverse strength of beams at elastic  limit is practically equal to the compressive strength of the  same material in short columns. It is accordingly possible to  calculate the approximate breaking strength of beams from the  compressive strength of short columns except when the wood is  brittle. Since tests on endwise compression are simpler, easier  to make, and less expensive than transverse bending tests, the  importance of this relation is obvious, though it does not do  away with the necessity of making beam tests.

The fibres (tracheids  in conifers) act as hollow tubes bound closely together, and in  giving way they either (1) buckle, or (2) bend.[5]    [Footnote 5: See Bulletin 70, _op. cit._, p. 129.]    The first is typical of any dry thin-walled cells, as is usually  the case in seasoned white pine and spruce, and in the early  wood of hard pines, hemlock, and other species with decided  contrast between the two portions of the growth ring. As a rule  buckling of a tracheid begins at the bordered pits which form  places of least resistance in the walls. In hardwoods such as  oak, chestnut, ash, etc., buckling occurs only in the  thinnest-walled elements, such as the vessels, and not in the  true fibres.    According to Jaccard[6] the folding of the cells is accompanied  by characteristic alterations of their walls which seem to split  them into extremely thin layers. When greatly magnified, these  layers appear in longitudinal sections as delicate threads  without any definite arrangements, while on cross section they  appear as numerous concentric strata. This may be explained on  the ground that the growth of a fibre is by successive layers  which, under the influence of compression, are sheared apart.  This is particularly the case with thick-walled cells such as  are found in late wood.    [Footnote 6: Jaccard, P.: Etude anatomique des bois comprimes.  Mit. d. Schw. Centralanstalt f.d. forst.
