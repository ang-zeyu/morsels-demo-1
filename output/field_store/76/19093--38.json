He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;      The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.      I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.      By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,      By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,      And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,      That in thy likeness thou appear to us!      Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.      Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him      To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle      Of some strange nature, letting it there stand      Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.      That were some spite; my invocation      Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,      I conjure only but to raise up him.      Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees      To be consorted with the humorous night.      Blind is his love and best befits the dark.      Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.      Now will he sit under a medlar tree      And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit      As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.      O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were      An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!      Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;      This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.      Come, shall we go?      Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain      'To seek him here that means not to be found.                                                           Exeunt.          Scene II.  Capulet's orchard.    Enter Romeo.        Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.                         Enter Juliet above at a window.        But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?      It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!      Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,      Who is already sick and pale with grief      That thou her maid art far more fair than she.      Be not her maid, since she is envious.      Her vestal livery is but sick and green,      And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.      It is my lady; O, it is my love!      O that she knew she were!      She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?      Her eye discourses; I will answer it.      I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.      Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,      Having some business, do entreat her eyes      To twinkle in their spheres till they return.      What if her eyes were there, they in her head?      The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars      As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven      Would through the airy region stream so bright      That birds would sing and think it were not night.      See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!      O that I were a glove upon that hand,      That I might touch that cheek!      Jul. Ay me!      Rom. She speaks.      O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art      As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,      As is a winged messenger of heaven      Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes      Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him      When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds      And sails upon the bosom of the air.      Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?      Deny thy father and refuse thy name!      Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,      And I'll no longer be a Capulet.      Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?      Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.      Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.      What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,      Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part      Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!      What's in a name? That which we call a rose      By any other name would smell as sweet.      So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,      Retain that dear perfection which he owes      Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;      And for that name, which is no part of thee,      Take all myself.      Rom. I take thee at thy word.      Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;      Henceforth I never will be Romeo.      Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,      So stumblest on my counsel?      Rom. By a name      I know not how to tell thee who I am.      My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,      Because it is an enemy to thee.      Had I it written, I would tear the word.      Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words      Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.      Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?      Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.      Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?      The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,      And the place death, considering who thou art,      If any of my kinsmen find thee here.      Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;      For stony limits cannot hold love out,      And what love can do, that dares love attempt.      Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.      Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.      Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye      Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,      And I am proof against their enmity.      Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.      Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;      And but thou love me, let them find me here.      My life were better ended by their hate      Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.      Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?      Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.      He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.      I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far      As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,      I would adventure for such merchandise.      Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;      Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek      For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.      Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny      What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!      Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';      And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,      Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,      They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,      If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.      Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,      I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,      So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.      In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,      And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;      But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true      Than those that have more cunning to be strange.      I should have been more strange, I must confess,      But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,      My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,      And not impute this yielding to light love,      Which the dark night hath so discovered.      Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,      That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-      Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,      That monthly changes in her circled orb,      Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.      Rom. What shall I swear by?      Jul. Do not swear at all;      Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,      Which is the god of my idolatry,      And I'll believe thee.      Rom. If my heart's dear love-      Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,      I have no joy of this contract to-night.      It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;      Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be      Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!      This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,      May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.      Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest      Come to thy heart as that within my breast!      Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?      Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?      Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.      Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;      And yet I would it were to give again.      Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?      Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.      And yet I wish but for the thing I have.      My bounty is as boundless as the sea,      My love as deep; the more I give to thee,      The more I have, for both are infinite.      I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!                                             [Nurse] calls within.      Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.      Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]      Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,      Being in night, all this is but a dream,      Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.                           Enter Juliet above.        Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.      If that thy bent of love be honourable,      Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,      By one that I'll procure to come to thee,      Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;      And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay      And follow thee my lord throughout the world.      Nurse. (within) Madam!      Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,      I do beseech thee-      Nurse. (within) Madam!      Jul. By-and-by I come.-      To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.      To-morrow will I send.      Rom. So thrive my soul-      Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.      Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!      Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;      But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.                         Enter Juliet again, [above].        Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice      To lure this tassel-gentle back again!      Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;      Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,      And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine      With repetition of my Romeo's name.

Gerhart Hauptmann's _Weavers_ and _Florian Geyer_ may be considered  the culminating points of this movement, in spite of their apparently  entirely prosaic form.    Modern German drama, which in its peculiar style is still largely  unappreciated because it has always been measured by its real or  supposed models, is, together with the free-rhythm lyric, the greatest  gift bestowed upon the treasure of forms of the world-literature by  the literature of Germany which has so often played the part of  recipient.    On the other hand, when speaking of the development of narrative  prose, we should remember what we have already accomplished in that  line. The \"Novelle\" alone has attained a fixed form, as a not too  voluminous account of a remarkable occurrence. It is formally  regulated in advance by the absolute domination of a decisive  incident--as, for example, the outbreak of a concealed love in Heyse,  or the moment of farewell in Theodor Storm. All previous incidents are  required to assist in working up to this climax; all later ones are  introduced merely to allow its echo to die away. In this austerity of  concentration the German \"Novelle,\" the one rigidly artistic form of  German prose, is related to the \"Short Story\" which has been so  eagerly heralded in recent times, especially by America. The \"Novelle\"  differs, however, from this form of literary composition, which  Maupassant cultivated with the most masterly and unrivaled success, by  its subordination to a climax; whereas the Short Story, in reality, is  usually a condensed novel, that is to say, the history of a  development concentrated in a few incidents. Our literature also  possesses such short \"sketches,\" but the love of psychological detail  in the development of the plot nearly always results in the greater  diffuseness of the novel. The real \"Novelle\" is, however, at least as  typical of the Germans as the Short Story is of the Americans, and in  no other form of literary composition has Germany produced so many  masters as in this--and in the lyric. For the latter is closely  related to the German \"Novelle\" because it loves to invest the way to  and from the culminating point with the charm produced by a certain  mood, as the half-German Bret Harte loves to do in similar artistic  studies, but the Russian Tschechow never indulges himself in, and the  Frenchman Maupassant but seldom. On this account our best writers of  \"Novellen\" have also been, almost without exception, eminent lyric  poets; such were Goethe, Tieck, Eichendorff, Moerike, Keller, Heyse,  Theodor Storm and C.F. Meyer; whereas, in the case of Marie von  Ebner-Eschenbach, who otherwise would form an exception, even what  appears to be a \"Novelle\" is in reality a \"small novel.\"    The novel, on the contrary, still enjoys in Germany the dangerous  privilege of formlessness. In its language it varies from the vague  lyric of romantic composition to the bureaucratic sobriety of  mechanically-compiled studies of real life. In its outline, in the  rhythm of its construction, in the division of its parts and the way  in which they are brought into relief, it has, in spite of masterly  individual performances, never attained a specific literary form, such  as has long been possessed by the English and the French novels.  Likewise the inclination, sanctioned by Goethe and the Romantic  school, to interpolate specimens of the least formed half-literary  _genres_--namely, letters and diaries--worked against the adoption of  a fixed form, notwithstanding that this expedient augmented the  great--often indeed too great--inner richness of the German novel.  Thus the German novel, as well as the so justly favorite form of  letters and diaries, is of infinitely more importance as a human or  contemporary \"document\" than as a direct work of art. We have,  however, already drawn attention to the fact that the never-failing  efforts to clothe the novel in a more esthetically pure form have, in  our own day, happily increased.    The traditional _material_ of literary compositions is, however, also  a conservative power, just as are language and form. The stock of  dominating motives naturally undergoes just as many transformations as  language or metrics; but, in both cases, what already exists has a  determining influence on everything new, often going so far as to  suppress the latter entirely. Customary themes preferably claim the  interest of the reader; as, for example, in the age of religious  pictures it would have been exceedingly hard to procure an order for a  purely worldly painting. The artists themselves unconsciously glide  into the usual path, and what was intended to be a world-poem flows  off into the convenient worn channel of the love-story. But the  vivifying and deepening power of the Germanic spirit has here, more  than in any other domain, destroyed the opposing force of inertia.    The oldest poetry is confined to such subjects as are of universal  interest--one could also say of universal importance. War and the  harvest, the festivals of the gods and the destinies of the tribe, are  the subjects of song. These things retain their traditional interest  even where a healthy communal life no longer exists. Epochs which are  absolutely wanting in political understanding still cultivate the  glory of Brutus in an epic or dramatic form; or those ages which can  scarcely lay claim to a living religious interest still join in  choruses in honor of Apollo or in honor of the Christian religion.  Every literature carries with it a large and respectable ballast of  sensations that are no longer felt, of objects that are no longer  seen, culminating in the spring-songs of poets confined to their room,  and the wine-songs of the water-drinkers. A stagnating literature, as  that of the seventeenth century was essentially, always has an  especially large amount of such rubbish. Poems composed for certain  occasions, in the worst sense--that is to say, poems of congratulation  and condolence written for money, trivial reflections and mechanical  devotion, occupy an alarmingly large space in the lyric of this  period. Drama is entirely confined, and the novel for the greater  part, to the dressing up in adopted forms of didactic subject matter  of the most general type. Men of individuality are, however, not  altogether lacking: such were lyric poets like Andreas Gryphius and  Paul Fleming, gnomologists like Johann Scheffler, and narrators like  J.J. Christoffel von Grimmelshausen; but even with them the personal  note does not dare to sound openly. The first to give free expression  again to intimate sensations is Christian Guenther, and he arouses  thereby contradiction, together with admiration. The court poets about  the year 1700 work more in a negative way, i. e., by that which they  did not express in their verses. The great merit of the pre-classical  writers is to have created space, on the one hand, for personal  sensations, and, on the other, for the great new thoughts of the age.  Hagedorn, with the elegant frivolity of the man of the world,  continued the necessary sifting of antiquated material; Albrecht von  Haller, with the deep seriousness of the great student of nature, once  more squarely faced the eternal problems. But the entire wealth of  inner experience, in its most exclusively individual sense, was first  revealed, not only to the literature of Germany but to modern  literature in general, by Klopstock. Along this path Goethe pressed  forward gloriously, his whole poetic work presenting, according to his  own testimony, a single great confession. From Haller, on the  contrary, proceeds the effort to develop a poetical style that would  enable individuals to share in the great thoughts of the age. Lessing  strides onward from _Minna von Barnhelm_--the first drama of  contemporary history since the _Persians_ of AEschylus--to _Nathan the  Wise_, herein following the lead of the \"literature with a distinct  purpose\" (_Tendenz-Dichtung_) of France, and especially of Voltaire,  otherwise antipathetic to Lessing. Lessing's great dramatic heir is  Schiller, whose tradition is in turn carried on by Kleist, the latter  allowing his personality to penetrate the subject matter far more even  than either of his predecessors.    But the utmost was done by Goethe, when in _Werther_ and _Goetz_, in  _Prometheus_ or _Satyros_, but above all eventually in _Faust_, he  lived through in advance--or, as he himself said, he \"anticipated\"  (_vorfuehlte_)--the peculiar experience of the age with such intensity  that, in the work which resulted, the individual experience became the  direct experience of the whole generation.    Out of the \"reverence for nature\" (_Naturfroemmigkeit_) with which he  contemplated all created things--from \"the Cedar of Lebanon to the  hyssop which grows on the wall,\" from the mighty movement of the  stream in _Mahomet_ to the bit of cheese that is weighed by the old  woman in _Die Geschwister_--out of all comes a widening of the poetic  horizon, the like of which had never before been seen in any age. The  Romanticists in reality only made a watchword out of this practice of  Goethe's when they demanded \"progressive universal poetry,\" by which  they meant that the poet should live through the whole experience of  creation in his own person. In demanding this, they--as the aging  Goethe had himself done--formed too narrow a conception of the  personal, and rejected too absolutely the problems of politics and of  science, so that once more a narrowing process ensued. But even in  their own ranks this tendency was offset by the exigency of the times;  after the wars of liberation, political and in general, poetry written  with a purpose"]]]
