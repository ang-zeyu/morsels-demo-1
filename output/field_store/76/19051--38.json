But he  affected a different conduct from his sires. He was the most popular man  of the whole council, and became in fact the sovereign of Rome. At first  he used his great power well, and the first year's government of the  decemvirs was famed for justice and moderation.    They also applied themselves diligently to their great work of  law-making, and before the end of the year had drawn up a code of ten  tables, which were posted in the Forum, that all citizens might examine  them and suggest amendments to the decemvirs. After due time thus spent,  the ten tables were confirmed and made law at the Comitia of the  Centuries. By this code equal justice was to be administered to both  orders without distinction of persons.    At the close of the year the first decemvirs laid down their office,  just as the consuls and other officers of state had been accustomed to  do before. They were succeeded by a second set of ten, who, for the next  year at least, were to conduct the government like their predecessors.  The only one of the old decemvirs reelected was Appius Claudius. The  patricians, indeed, endeavored to prevent even this, and to this end he  was himself appointed to preside at the new elections; for it was held  impossible for a chief magistrate to return his own name, when he was  himself presiding. But Appius scorned precedents. He returned himself as  elected, together with nine others, men of no name, while two of the  great Quinctian gens, who offered themselves, were rejected.    Of the new decemvirs, it is certain that three--and it is probable that  five--were plebeians. Appius, with the plebeian Oppius, held the  judicial office, and remained in the city; and these two seem to have  been regarded as the chiefs. The other six commanded the armies and  discharged the duties previously assigned to the quaestors and aediles.    The first decemvirs had earned the respect and esteem of their  fellow-citizens. The new Council of Ten deserved the hatred which has  ever since cloven to their name. Appius now threw off the mask which he  had so long worn, and assumed his natural character--the same as had  distinguished his sire and grandsire, of unhappy memory. He became an  absolute despot. His brethren in the council offered no hinderance to  his will; even the plebeian decemvirs, bribed by power, fell into his  way of action and supported his tyranny. They each had twelve lictors,  who carried fasces with the axes in them the symbol of absolute power,  as in the times of the kings; so that it was said, \"Rome had now twelve  Tarquins instead of one, and one hundred and twenty armed lictors  instead of twelve!\" All freedom of speech ceased. The senate was seldom  called together. The leading men, patricians and plebeians, left the  city. The outward aspect of things was that of perfect calm and peace,  but an opportunity only was wanting for the discontent which was  smouldering in all men's hearts to break out and show itself.    By the end of the year the decemvirs had added two more tables to the  code, so that there were now twelve tables. But these two last were of a  most oppressive and arbitrary kind, devoted chiefly to restore the  ancient privileges of the patrician caste. Of these tables, it should be  observed that they were made laws not by the vote of the people, but by  the simple edict of the decemvirs.    It was, no doubt, expected that the second decemvirs also would have  held _comitia_ for the election of successors. But Appius and his  colleagues showed no such intention, and when the year came to a close  they continued to hold office as if they had been reelected. So firmly  did their power seem to be established that we hear of no endeavor being  made to induce them to resign.    In the course of this next year (B.C. 449), the border wars were  renewed. On the north the Sabines, and the AEquians on the northeast,  invaded the Roman country at the same time. The latter penetrated as far  as Mount Algidus, as in B.C. 458, when they were routed by old  Cincinnatus. The decemvirs probably, like the patrician burgesses in  former times, regarded these inroads not without satisfaction; for they  turned away the mind of the people from their sufferings at home. Yet  from these very wars sprung the events which overturned their power and  destroyed themselves.    Two armies were levied, one to check the Sabines, the other to oppose  the AEquians, and these were commanded by the six military decemvirs.  Appius and Oppius remained to administer affairs at home. But there was  no spirit in the armies. Both were defeated; and that which was opposed  to the AEquians was compelled to take refuge within the walls of  Tusculum.    Then followed two events which were preserved in well-known legends, and  which give the popular narrative of the manner in which the power of the  decemvirs was at last overthrown.    LEGEND OF SICCIUS DENTATUS    In the army sent against the Sabines, Siccius Dentatus was known as the  bravest man. He was then serving as a centurion; he had fought in one  hundred and twenty battles; he had slain eight champions in single  combat; had saved the lives of fourteen citizens; had received forty  wounds, all in front; had followed in nine triumphal processions, and  had won crowns and decorations without number. This gallant veteran had  taken an active part in the civil contests between the two orders, and  was now suspected, by the decemvirs commanding the Sabine army, of  plotting against them. Accordingly they determined to get rid of him;  and for this end they sent him out as if to reconnoitre, with a party of  soldiers, who were secretly instructed to murder him. Having discovered  their design, he set his back against a rock and resolved to sell his  life dearly. More than one of his assailants fell and the rest stood at  bay around him, not venturing to come within sword's length, when one  wretch climbed up the rock behind and crushed the brave old man with a  massive stone. But the manner of his death could not be hidden from the  army, and the generals only prevented an outbreak by honoring him with a  magnificent funeral.    Such was the state of things in the Sabine army.    LEGEND OF VIRGINIA[23]    [Footnote 23: Dionysius is the authority for this legend.]    The other army had a still grosser outrage to complain of. In this there  was a notable centurion, Virginius by name. His daughter Virginia, just  ripening into womanhood, beautiful as the day, was betrothed to L.  Icilius, the tribune who had carried the law for allotting the Aventine  hill to the plebeians. Appius Claudius, the decemvir, saw her and lusted  to make her his own. And with this intent he ordered one of his clients,  M. Claudius by name, to lay hands upon her as she was going to her  school in the Forum, and to claim her as his slave. The man did so; and  when the cries of her nurse brought a crowd round them, M. Claudius  insisted on taking her before the decemvir, in order, as he said, to  have the case fairly tried. Her friends consented; and no sooner had  Appius heard the matter than he gave judgment that the maiden should be  delivered up to the claimant, who should be bound to produce her in case  her alleged father appeared to gainsay the claim. Now this judgment was  directly against one of the laws of the twelve tables, which Appius  himself had framed; for therein it was provided that any person being at  freedom should continue free till it was proved that such person was a  slave. Icilius, therefore, with Numitorius, the uncle of the maiden,  boldly argued against the legality of the judgment, and at length  Appius, fearing a tumult, agreed to leave the girl in their hands on  condition of their giving bail to bring her before him next morning; and  then, if Virginius did not appear, he would at once, he said, give her  up to her pretended master. To this Icilius consented, but he delayed  giving bail, pretending that he could not procure it readily; and in the  mean time he sent off a secret message to the camp on Algidus, to inform  Virginius of what had happened. As soon as the bail was given, Appius  also sent a message to the decemvirs in command of that army, ordering  them to refuse leave of absence to Virginius. But when this last message  arrived, Virginius was already halfway on his road to Rome; for the  distance was not more than twenty miles, and he had started at  nightfall.    Next morning, early, Virginius entered the Forum, leading his daughter  by the hand, both clad in mean attire. A great number of friends and  matrons attended him, and he went about among the people entreating them  to support him against the tyranny of Appius. So when Appius came to  take his place on the judgment seat he found the Forum full of people,  all friendly to Virginius and his cause. But he inherited the boldness  as well as the vices of his sires, and though he saw Virginius standing  there ready to prove that he was the maiden's father, he at once gave  judgment, against his own law, that Virginia should be given up to M.  Claudius till it should be proved that she was free. The wretch came up  to seize her, and the lictors kept the people from him. Virginius, now  despairing of deliverance, begged Appius to allow him to ask the maiden  whether she were indeed his daughter or not. \"If,\" said he, \"I find I am  not her father, I shall bear her loss the lighter.\" Under this pretence  he drew her aside to a spot upon the northern side of the Forum,  afterward called the \"_Nova Tabernce_\" and here, snatching up a knife  from a butcher's stall, he cried: \"In this way only can I keep thee  free!\"--and so saying, stabbed her to the heart. Then he turned to the  tribunal and said, \"On thee, Appius, and on thy head be this blood!\"  Appius cried out to seize \"the murderer,\" but the crowd made way for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10136"],[0,"The Book of Household Management (#5)"],[1,"blancs, or white haricot beans 1119  Harness, cleaning old 2221-2    Paste 2220    Room, the 2208  Heart, palpitation of the 2646  Henbane, hemlock, nightshade, and foxglove 2664  Herbs, to dry for winter use 445    Powder of, for flavouring 446    Sweet 417  Heradotus pudding 1287  Herring, the 268    Red 267  Herrings, baked, white 268    Red, or Yarmouth bleaters 267    To choose 268  Hessian soup 171  Hidden mountain, the 1438  Hodge-podge 191, 720  Hog, antiquity of the 826, 834    Fossil remains of the 829    General observations on the common 765-95    In England 837    Not bacon 807    Universality of the 833    Wild and domestic 823  Holly leaves, to frost 1545  Honey cake 1758  Hooping cough 2468, 2564    Symptoms of 2565    Treatment of 2566-7  Horse, the 2203  Horses, choosing 2231    Exercising 2213  Horses feeding 2224-15    Watering 2212, 2216  Horseradish, the 447    Medical properties of the 1122    Sauce 447    Vinegar 448  Hot spice 524  Housekeeper, daily duties of the 58-61    General duties of the 55    Knowledge of cookery 57    Necessary qualifications for a 56  Housemaid, bedroom, attention to 2306, 2323-4    Bright grates 2298    Candlestick and lamp-cleaning 2330    Carpet-sweeping 2312    Chips broken off furniture 2330    Cleanings, periodical 2326-9    Dress of the 2319    Dusting 2313    Duties after dinner 2321      evening 2322      general 2292-4    Fire-lighting 2296-7    Furniture-cleaning 2307, 2313    General directions to the 2300-5    Hartshorn, for plate-cleaning 2316    Laying dinner-table 2314-5    Marble, to clean 2333-4    Needlework 2325    Plate, to clean 2317      rags for daily use 2318    Upper and under 2291    Waiting at table 2320    Recipe, Brunswick black, to make 2295      cement for joining broken glass or china 2331-2      decanters, to clean 2336      floorcloth, to clean 2335      furniture gloss, German 2339        paste 2310        polish 2308-9      gilt frames, to brighten 2337      grates and fire irons, to preserve from rust 2338      polish for bright grates 2299  Hunter's pudding 1288  Husband and wife 2725-9  Hysterics 2643    Ice, fruit creams, to make 1555    Lemon-water 1557    To ice, or glaze pastry 1334  Iced, apple pudding 1290    Apples, or apple hedgehog 1394    Currants 1558    Oranges 1564    Pudding 1289  Ices, fruit-water, to make 1556    General observations on 1510-11  Icing, for cakes, almond 1735    sugar 1736  Indian, Chetney sauce 452    Corn-flour bread 1721    Curry powder 449    Fritters 1435    Mustard 450    Pickle 451    Trifle 1436  Infant, the 2460-2577  Ink-spots, to remove 2271  Invalid cookery, rules to be observed in 1841-54  Invalid's cutlet, the 1865    Jelly 1869    Lemonade 1870  Insurance 2708-10  I.
