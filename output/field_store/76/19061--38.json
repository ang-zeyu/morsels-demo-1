This was  the favorite god of Nebuchadnezzar, and epithets of the highest honor  were conferred upon him, as \"King of heaven and earth,\" the \"Lord of all  beings,\" etc. Nergal (Mars) was a war god, his name signifying \"the  great Hero,\" \"the King of battles.\" He goes before kings in their  military expeditions, and lends them assistance in the chase. His emblem  is the human-headed winged lion seen at the entrance of royal palaces.  Ista (Venus) was the goddess of beauty, presiding over the loves of both  men and animals, and was worshipped with unchaste rites. Nebo (Mercury)  had the charge over learning and culture,--the god of wisdom, who  \"teaches and instructs.\"    There were other deities in the Assyrian and Babylonian pantheon whom I  need not name, since they played a comparatively unimportant part in  human affairs, like the inferior deities of the Romans, presiding over  dreams, over feasts, over marriage, and the like.    The Phoenicians, like the Assyrians, had their goddesses. Astoreth, or  Astarte, represented the great female productive principle, as Baal did  the male. It was originally a name for the energy of God, on a par with  Baal. In one of her aspects she represented the moon; but more commonly  she was the representative of the female principle in Nature, and was  connected more or less with voluptuous rites,--the equivalent of  Aphrodite, or Venus. Tanith also was a noted female deity, and was  worshipped at Carthage and Cyprus by the Phoenician settlers. The name  is associated, according to Gesenius, with the Egyptian goddess Nut, and  with the Grecian Artemis the huntress.    An important thing to be observed of these various deities is that they  do not uniformly represent the same power. Thus Baal, the Phoenician  sun-god, was made by the Greeks and Romans equivalent to Zeus, or  Jupiter, the god of thunder and storms. Apollo, the sun-god of the  Greeks, was not so powerful as Zeus, the god of the atmosphere; while in  Assyria and Phoenicia the sun-god was the greater deity. In Babylonia,  Shamas was a sun-god as well as Bel; and Bel again was the god of the  heavens, like Zeus.    While Zeus was the supreme deity in the Greek mythology, rather than  Apollo the sun, it seems that on the whole the sun was the prominent and  the most commonly worshipped deity of all the Oriental nations, as being  the most powerful force in Nature. Behind the sun, however, there was  supposed to be an indefinite creative power, whose form was not  represented, worshipped in no particular temple by the esoteric few who  were his votaries, and called the \"Father of all the gods,\" \"the Ancient  of days,\" reigning supreme over them all. This indefinite conception of  the Jehovah of the Hebrews seems to me the last flickering light of the  primitive revelation, shining in the souls of the most enlightened of  the Pagan worshippers, including perhaps the greatest of the monarchs,  who were priests as well as kings.    The most distinguishing feature in the worship of all the gods of  antiquity, whether among Egyptians, or Assyrians, or Babylonians, or  Phoenicians, or Greeks, or Romans, is that of oblations and sacrifices.  It was even a peculiarity of the old Jewish religion, as well as that of  China and India. These oblations and sacrifices were sometimes offered  to the deity, whatever his form or name, as an expiation for sin, of  which the soul is conscious in all ages and countries; sometimes to  obtain divine favor, as in military expeditions, or to secure any object  dearest to the heart, such as health, prosperity, or peace; sometimes to  propitiate the deity in order to avert the calamities following his  supposed wrath or vengeance. The oblations were usually in the form of  wine, honey, or the fruits of the earth, which were supposed to be  necessary for the nourishment of the gods, especially in Greece. The  sacrifices were generally of oxen, sheep, and goats, the most valued and  precious of human property in primitive times, for those old heathen  never offered to their deities that which cost them nothing, but rather  that which was dearest to them. Sometimes, especially in Phoenicia,  human beings were offered in sacrifice, the most repulsive peculiarity  of polytheism. But the instincts of humanity generally kept men from  rites so revolting. Christianity, as one of its distinguishing features,  abolished all forms of outward sacrifice, as superstitious and useless.  The sacrifices pleasing to God are a broken spirit, as revealed to David  and Isaiah amid all the ceremonies and ritualism of Jewish worship, and  still more to Paul and Peter when the new dispensation was fully  declared. The only sacrifice which Christ enjoined was self-sacrifice,  supreme devotion to a spiritual and unseen and supreme God, and to his  children: as the Christ took upon himself the form of a man, suffering  evil all his days, and finally even an ignominious death, in obedience  to his Father's will, that the world might be saved by his own  self-sacrifice.    With sacrifices as an essential feature of all the ancient religions, if  we except that of Persia in the time of Zoroaster, there was need of an  officiating priesthood. The priests in all countries sought to gain  power and influence, and made themselves an exclusive caste, more or  less powerful as circumstances favored their usurpations. The priestly  caste became a terrible power in Egypt and India, where the people, it  would seem, were most susceptible to religious impressions, were most  docile and most ignorant, and had in constant view the future welfare of  their souls. In China, where there was scarcely any religion at all,  this priestly power was unknown; and it was especially weak among the  Greeks, who had no fear of the future, and who worshipped beauty and  grace rather than a spiritual god. Sacerdotalism entered into  Christianity when it became corrupted by the lust of dominion and power,  and with great force ruled the Christian world in times of ignorance and  superstition. It is sad to think that the decline of sacerdotalism is  associated with the growth of infidelity and religious indifference,  showing how few worship God in spirit and in truth even in Christian  countries. Yet even that reaction is humanly natural; and as it so  surely follows upon epochs of priestcraft, it may be a part of the  divine process of arousing men to the evils of superstition.    Among all nations where polytheism prevailed, idolatry became a natural  sequence,--that is, the worship of animals and of graven images, at  first as symbols of the deities that were worshipped, generally the sun,  moon, and stars, and the elements of Nature, like fire, water, and air.  But the symbols of divine power, as degeneracy increased and ignorance  set in, were in succession worshipped as deities, as in India and Africa  at the present day. This is the lowest form of religion, and the most  repulsive and degraded which has prevailed in the world,--showing the  enormous difference between the primitive faiths and the worship which  succeeded, growing more and more hideous with the progress of ages,  until the fulness of time arrived when God sent reformers among the  debased people, more or less supernaturally inspired, to declare new  truth, and even to revive the knowledge of the old in danger of being  utterly lost.    It is a pleasant thing to remember that the religions thus far treated,  as known to the Jews, and by which they were more or less contaminated,  have all passed away with the fall of empires and the spread of divine  truth; and they never again can be revived in the countries where they  nourished. Mohammedanism, a monotheistic religion, has taken their  place, and driven the ancient idols to the moles and the bats; and where  Mohammedanism has failed to extirpate ancient idolatries, Christianity  in some form has come in and dethroned them forever.           *       *       *       *       *    There was one form of religion with which the Jews came in contact which  was comparatively pure; and this was the religion of Persia, the  loftiest form of all Pagan beliefs.    The Persians were an important branch of the Iranian family. \"The  Iranians were the dominant race throughout the entire tract lying  between the Suliman mountains and the Pamir steppe on the one hand, and  the great Mesopotamian valley on the other.\" It was a region of great  extremes of temperature,--the summers being hot, and the winters  piercingly cold. A great part of this region is an arid and frightful  desert; but the more favored portions are extremely fertile. In this  country the Iranians settled at a very early period, probably 2500 B.C.,  about the time the Hindus emigrated from Central Asia to the banks of  the Indus. Both Iranians and Hindus belonged to the great Aryan or  Indo-European race, whose original settlements were on the high  table-lands northeast of Samarkand, in the modern Bokhara, watered by  the Oxus, or Amon River. From these rugged regions east of the Caspian  Sea, where the means of subsistence are difficult to be obtained, the  Aryans emigrated to India on the southeast, to Iran on the southwest, to  Europe on the west,--all speaking substantially the same language.    Of those who settled in Iran, the Persians were the most prominent,--a  brave, hardy, and adventurous people, warlike in their habits, and moral  in their conduct. They were a pastoral rather than a nomadic people, and  gloried in their horses and cattle. They had great skill as archers and  horsemen, and furnished the best cavalry among the ancients. They lived  in fixed habitations, and their houses had windows and fireplaces; but  they were doomed to a perpetual struggle with a severe and uncertain  climate, and a soil which required ceaseless diligence. \"The whole  plateau of Iran,\" says Johnson,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10478"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 02: Jewish Heroes and Prophets (#5)"],[1,"than ours. And if so, should we  not be lenient to immoralities and crimes committed in darker ages, if  the ordinary current of men's lives was lofty and religious? On this  principle we should be slow to denounce Christian people who formerly  held slaves without remorse, when this sin did not shock the age in  which they lived, and was not discrepant with prevailing ideas as to  right and wrong. It is clear that in patriarchal times men had,  according to universally accepted ideas, the power of life and death  over their families, which it would be absurd and wicked to claim in our  day, with our increased light as to moral distinctions. Hence, on the  command of God to slay his son, Abraham had no scruples on the ground of  morality; that is, he did not feel that it was wrong to take his son's  life if God commanded him to do so, any more than it would be wrong, if  required, to slay a slave or an animal, since both were alike his  property. Had he entertained more enlightened views as to the sacredness  of life, he might have felt differently. With his views, God's command  did not clash with his conscience.    Still, the sacrifice of Isaac was a terrible shock to Abraham's paternal  affection. The anguish of his soul was none the less, whether he had the  right of life and death or not. He was required to part with the dearest  thing he had on earth, in whom was bound up his earthly happiness. What  had he to live for, but Isaac? He doubtless loved this child of his old  age with exceeding tenderness, devotion, and intensity; and what was  perhaps still more weighty, in that day of polygamous households, than  mere paternal affection, with Isaac were identified all the hopes and  promises which had been held out to Abraham by God himself of becoming  the father of a mighty and favored race. His affection as a father was  strained to its utmost tension, but yet more was his faith in being the  progenitor of offspring that should inherit the land of Canaan.  Nevertheless, at God's command he was willing to make the sacrifice,  \"accounting that God is able to raise up, even from the dead.\" Was there  ever such a supreme act of obedience in the history of our race? Has  there ever been from his time to ours such a transcendent manifestation  of faith? By reason Abraham saw the foundation of his hopes utterly  swept away; and yet his faith towers above reason, and he feels that the  divine promises in some way will be fulfilled. Did any man of genius  ever conceive such an illustration of blended piety and obedience? Has  dramatic poetry ever created such a display of conflicting emotions? Is  it possible for a human being to transcend so mighty a sacrifice, and  all by the power of faith? Let those philosophers and theologians who  aspire to define faith, and vainly try to reconcile it with reason,  learn modesty and wisdom from the lesson of Abraham, who is its great  exponent, and be content with the definition of Paul, himself, that it  is \"the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen;\"  that reason was in Abraham's case subordinate to a loftier and grander  principle,--even a firm conviction, which nothing could shake, of the  accomplishment of an end against all probabilities and mortal  calculations, resting solely on a divine promise.    Another remarkable thing about that memorable sacrifice is, that Abraham  does not expostulate or hesitate, but calmly and resolutely prepares for  the slaughter of the innocent and unresisting victim, suppressing all  the while his feelings as a father in obedience and love to the  Sovereign of heaven and earth, whose will is his supreme law.    \"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac  his son,\" who was compelled as it were to bear his own cross. And he  took the fire in his hand and a knife, and Isaac said, \"Behold the fire  and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\" yet suffered  himself to be bound by his father on the altar. And Abraham then  stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. At this  supreme moment of his trial, he heard the angel of the Lord calling upon  him out of heaven and saying, \"Abraham! Abraham! lay not thine hand upon  the lad, neither do thou anything unto him; for now I know that thou  fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from  me.... And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold behind him  was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took  the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering instead of his son.  And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham a second time out of  heaven and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because  thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only  son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will  multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand upon the  seashore, and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,  because thou hast obeyed my voice.\"    There are no more recorded promises to Abraham, no more trials of his  faith. His righteousness was established, and he was justified before  God. His subsequent life was that of peace, prosperity, and exaltation.  He lives to the end in transcendent repose with his family and vast  possessions. His only remaining solicitude is for a suitable wife for  Isaac, concerning whom there is nothing remarkable in gifts or fortunes,  but who maintains the faith of his father, and lives like him in  patriarchal dignity and opulence.    The great interest we feel in Abraham is as \"the father of the  faithful,\" as a model of that exalted sentiment which is best defined  and interpreted by his own trials and experiences; and hence I shall not  dwell on the well known incidents of his life outside the varied calls  and promises by which he became the most favored man in human annals. It  was his faith which made him immortal, and with which his name is  forever associated. It is his religious faith looming up, after four  thousand years, for our admiration and veneration which is the true  subject of our meditation. This, I think, is distinct from our ordinary  conception of faith, such as a belief in the operation of natural laws,  in the return of the seasons, in the rewards of virtue, in the assurance  of prosperity with due regard to the conditions of success. Faith in a  friend, in a nation's future, in the triumphs of a good cause, in our  own energies and resources _is_, I grant, necessarily connected with  reason, with wide observation and experience, with induction, with laws  of nature and of mind. But religious faith is supreme trust in an unseen  God and supreme obedience to his commands, without any other exercise of  reason than the intuitive conviction that what he orders is right  because he orders it, whether we can fathom his wisdom or not. \"Canst  thou by searching find out Him?\"    Yet notwithstanding the exalted faith of Abraham, by which all religious  faith is tested, an eternal pattern and example for our reverence and  imitation, the grand old man deceived both Pharaoh and Abimelech, and if  he did not tell positive lies, he uttered only half truths, for Sarah  was a half sister; and thus he put expediency and policy above moral  rectitude,--to be palliated indeed in his case by the desire to  preserve his wife from pollution. Yet this is the only blot on his  otherwise reproachless character, marked by so many noble traits that he  may be regarded as almost perfect. His righteousness was as memorable as  his faith, living in the fear of God. How noble was his  disinterestedness in giving to Lot the choice of lands for his family  and his flocks and his cattle! How brave was he in rescuing his kinsman  from the hands of conquering kings! How lofty in refusing any  remuneration for his services! How fervent were his intercessions with  the Almighty for the preservation of the cities of the plain! How  hospitable his mode of life, as when he entertained angels unawares! How  kind he was to Hagar when she had incurred the jealousy of Sarah! How  serene and dignified and generous he was, the model of courtesy  and kindness!    With Abraham we associate the supremest happiness which an old man can  attain unto and enjoy. He was prosperous, rich, powerful, and favored in  every way; but the chief source of his happiness was the superb  consciousness that he was to be the progenitor of a mighty and numerous  progeny, through whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed.  How far his faith was connected with temporal prosperity we cannot tell.  Prosperity seems to have been the blessing of the Old Testament, as  adversity was the blessing of the New. But he was certain of this,--that  his descendants would possess ultimately the land of Canaan, and would  be as numerous as the stars of heaven. He was certain that in some  mysterious way there would come from his race something that would be a  blessing to mankind. Was it revealed to his exultant soul what this  blessing should be? Did this old patriarch cast a prophetic eye  beyond the ages, and see that the promise made to him was spiritual  rather than material, pertaining to the final triumph of truth and  righteousness?--that the unity of God, which he taught to Isaac and  perhaps to Ishmael, was to be upheld by his race alone among prevailing  idolatries, until the Saviour should come to reveal a new dispensation  and finally draw all men unto him? Did Abraham fully realize what a  magnificent nation the Israelites should become,--not merely the rulers  of western Asia under David and Solomon, but that even after their final  dispersion they should furnish ministers to kings, scholars to  universities, and dictators to legislative halls,--an unconquerable  race, powerful even after the vicissitudes and humiliations of four  thousand years? Did he realize fully"]]]
