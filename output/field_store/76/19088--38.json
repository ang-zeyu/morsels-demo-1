Then was Camanla happy, but one day he  had no food to give his wife, so he made a little taon, or fish trap,  and said to it: \"My pretty taon, la, you may go, la, to the river,  la, to get me some fish, la.\" The taon then walked toward the river,  and soon came back, full of fish. Camanla was an object of envy to  all the world.    His happiness was soon heard of by his friend Parotpot, who became  very envious. At last he went to Camanla's house. When he met his  friend, he said to him: \"You are very happy, my friend, and I envy  you.\" Camanla replied: \"Yes, I am very fortunate. I have my little  boat that sails every day to get my food, and a little taon that goes  to the river and brings me fine fish.\"    Parotpot returned sadly home. He concluded to build a boat like his  friend's, but Parotpot, when he talked, ended every third or fourth  word with \"pot,\" (pronounced po) the ending of his name: This word  has a scornful meaning. When the boat was finished, he began to talk  to it as follows: \"My boat, pot, you may go, pot, to find me a wife,  pot, prettier than my friend's wife, pot.\" The boat sailed away,  and reached a large river, just as some men were looking for a boat  to take across the body of their grandmother, in order to bury it in  the cemetery of the town. When they saw the boat they were glad to  get across the river so easily, so they lifted the body and placed  it in the boat. When the boat felt that something was on board, she  sailed swiftly towards home, leaving the men behind. Parotpot was  watching, and when he saw the boat coming, he began to talk thus:  \"My boat, pot, is coming, pot, to bring me, pot, a pretty lady, pot,  to marry me, pot.\" But, alas! a dead grandmother, instead of a pretty  lady! He was so angry that he seized his bolo and chopped the boat  to pieces, leaving the body to float away.    But Parotpot thought that he might succeed better with a fish-trap,  like his friend Camanla's. When he had finished it, he sent it to the  river, saying: \"My taon, pot, go now to the river, pot, and catch many  fishes, pot, for my dinner, pot.\" The taon went. It was Sunday and the  people of the town were killing cattle for their Sunday dinner, and  throwing the waste into the river. All this filth floated into the taon  and filled it. Then it ran back home. While the taon had been gone,  Parotpot had been making preparations for a great dinner. He cooked  the rice and washed the dishes, and then invited his friends to come to  his house and share his excellent dinner. When he saw the taon coming,  he said: \"My taon, pot, is coming now, pot, to bring me many fine fish,  pot, for my dinner, pot.\" When his neighbors saw what was in the taon,  they laughed, and Parotpot said: \"I can never be as happy as my friend  Camanla.\" Then he took the taon and threw it into the fire.      CHAPTER 4    Juan, the Student.    There was once a poor couple who lived happily in a quiet place. They  had one son, named Juan, whom at first they loved very much; but  afterwards, either because their extreme poverty made it difficult  for them to support him, or because of his wickedness and waywardness,  they began to hate him, and made plans to kill him.    In order to carry out this purpose, the father called his son to him  one evening, and said: \"My son, to-morrow we will go to the mountain to  get some lumber with which to repair our house. I want you to prepare  our breakfast very early, so that we may set out before the sun rises.\"    On the next morning they arose very early and ate their breakfast. As  it consisted only of rice and a few small fishes, it was soon finished,  and they set out for the mountain. When they had arrived at a lonely  spot, the man seized his son and fastened him to a large tree. Then  he took his bolo and cut down the tree in such a way as to cause it  to fall on the boy and kill him. Then he returned home, thinking that  he should have no more trouble on account of his son.    Early the next morning, the man heard a noise as of some one  approaching the house. On opening a window he perceived his son,  whom he supposed he had killed on the previous day, coming towards  the house and bearing a heavy load of wood. When the boy had come  near he asked where he should put the wood. At first the father was  too much frightened to reply, but at last he told his son to put the  wood down near the house.    For a long time Juan lived at home, but his parents hated him  continually, and at last decided to give him poison. One day they sent  him on a long trip, giving him seven pieces of poisoned bread for his  food along the way. When he had become weary and hungry from walking,  he sat down under a tree and began to open the handkerchief to get from  it some of the bread to eat. Suddenly a number of crows flew down from  the tree, seized the bread, ate it, and almost immediately died. The  boy at once perceived the intention of his parents and returned  home. As soon as he arrived there, he declared to his father and  mother his intention of leaving them and going elsewhere to live. As  soon as they heard him, they were full of joy, and readily gave him  the desired permission.    He went to a distant town, and decided to study. He made such progress  that his teachers were charmed with his diligence. He was very fond  of debates with his schoolmates, and one day asked them the following  riddle: \"Two tried to kill one, one killed seven, two were left, and  one went away.\" They searched through the books for the answer to the  riddle, but as they were unable to find it, they agreed that Juan was  the cleverest one among them, since they could not answer his riddle.    One day the student met a young lady to whom he gave the riddle. She  asked for a little time in which to study it, and this being granted,  went home, disguised herself as a young man and, returning, asked  Juan to tell the answer to the riddle. \"For I know,\" she said,  \"that many students have tried to find the solution of this riddle,  but have not been successful.\" Juan finally granted her request,  and told her the answer to the riddle, which was the story of his life.    Then the young lady returned home, put on her own clothes, and went  back to the student's house, to give him the answer to his riddle. When  Juan heard her answer, he thought her a very clever young woman,  since she had succeeded where so many young men had failed, so he  fell in love with the young lady and married her.      CHAPTER 5    The Two Wives and the Witch.    There was once a man who had a wife that was not pretty. He became  tired of looking at her, and so went away and married another wife.    His first wife was in great sorrow, and wept every day. One day as she  was crying by the well, where she had gone for water, a woman asked  her: \"Why are you weeping?\" The wife answered: \"Because my husband has  left me and gone to live with another wife.\" \"Why?\" said the witch,  for that is what the woman was.    \"Because I have not a pretty face,\" answered the wife. While she  was talking the witch touched the wife's face, and then she said:  \"I cannot stay here any longer,\" and went off.    When the wife reached home she looked in the glass and saw that her  face had been changed until it was the most beautiful in the town. Very  soon a rumor spread through the town that in such and such a house  there was living a very beautiful woman. Many young men went to see  the pretty woman, and all were pleased with her beauty.    The bad husband went also. He was astonished that his wife was not at  home, and that a pretty woman was living there alone. He bowed to the  lady and avowed his love. The lady at first refused to believe him,  and said: \"If you will leave the woman who is now your wife and come  to live with me right along I will take you for my husband.\" The man  agreed, and went to live with the pretty woman.    The other woman was very angry when she heard the news, for it was  reported that the pretty woman was the man's first wife, who had  been changed by a witch. She determined to try what the witch could  do for her, and went to get water at the same well.    The witch appeared and asked: \"Why are you weeping, my good woman?\" The  woman told her that her husband had gone away to live with the pretty  woman. As she was speaking, the witch touched her face, and said:  \"Go home, my good woman, and do not weep, for your husband will come  very soon to see you.\"    When she heard this she ran home as fast as she could. All the  people whom she met on the road were afraid of her, because she was  so ugly. Her nose was about two feet long, her ears looked like large  handkerchiefs, and her eyes were as big as saucers. Nobody recognized  her, not even her mother. All were afraid of such a creature. When  she saw in the glass how ugly she was, she refused to eat, and in a  few days she died.      CHAPTER 6    The Living Head.    There once lived a man and his wife who had no children. They  earnestly desired to have a son, so they prayed to their God, Diva,  that he would give them a son, even if it were only a head.    Diva pitied them, and gave them a head for a son. Head, for that  was his name, grew up, and gradually his father and mother ceased to  think of his misfortune, and grew to love him very much.    One day Head saw the chief's daughter pass the house, and fell in love  with her. \"Mother,\" he said, \"I am in love with the chief's daughter  and wish to marry her. Go now, I pray you, to the chief and ask him to  give me his daughter to be my wife.\" \"Dear Head,\" answered his mother,  \"it is of no use to go on such an errand, the chief's daughter will  surely not be willing to marry only a head.\" But Head insisted, so,  in order to quiet him, his mother went to the chief and made known  her son's desire. Of course she met with a refusal, and returned home  and told Head"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11029"],[0,"American Hero-Myths: A Study in the Native Religions of the Western Continent (#5)"],[1,"e. The Peruvians, for instance, had large  establishments where were kept in rigid seclusion the \"virgins of the  sun.\" Did one of these violate her vow of chastity, she and her fellow  criminal were at once put to death; but did she claim that the child she  bore was of divine parentage, and the contrary could not be shown, then  she was feted as a queen, and the product of her womb was classed among  princes, as a son of the sun. So, in the inscription at Thebes, in the  temple of the virgin goddess Mat, we read where she says of herself: \"My  garment no man has lifted up; the fruit that I have borne was begotten of  the sun.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: \"[Greek: Ton emon chitona oudeis apechaluphen on ego charpon  etechan, aelios egeneto.]\" Proclus, quoted by Tiele, ubi supra, p. 204,  note.]    I do not venture too much in saying that it were easy to parallel every  event in these American hero-myths, every phase of character of the  personages they represent, with others drawn from Aryan and Egyptian  legends long familiar to students, and which now are fully recognized as  having in them nothing of the substance of history, but as pure creations  of the religious imagination working on the processes of nature brought  into relation to the hopes and fears of men.    If this is so, is it not time that we dismiss, once for all, these  American myths from the domain of historical traditions? Why should we try  to make a king of Itzamna, an enlightened ruler of Quetzalcoatl, a  cultured nation of the Toltecs, when the proof is of the strongest, that  every one of these is an absolutely baseless fiction of mythology? Let it  be understood, hereafter, that whoever uses these names in an historical  sense betrays an ignorance of the subject he handles, which, were it in  the better known field of Aryan or Egyptian lore, would at once convict  him of not meriting the name of scholar.    In European history the day has passed when it was allowable to construct  primitive chronicles out of fairy tales and nature myths. The science of  comparative mythology has assigned to these venerable stories a different,  though not less noble, interpretation. How much longer must we wait to see  the same canons of criticism applied to the products of the religious  fancy of the red race?    Furthermore, if the myths of the American nations are shown to be capable  of a consistent interpretation by the principles of comparative mythology,  let it be recognized that they are neither to be discarded because they  resemble some familiar to their European conquerors, nor does that  similarity mean that they are historically derived, the one from the  other. Each is an independent growth, but as each is the reflex in a  common psychical nature of the same phenomena, the same forms of  expression were adopted to convey them.        CHAPTER II.

Nearly all that vast area which lies between Hudson Bay and the Savannah  river, and the Mississippi river and the Atlantic coast, was peopled at  the epoch of the discovery by the members of two linguistic families--the  Algonkins and the Iroquois. They were on about the same plane of culture,  but differed much in temperament and radically in language. Yet their  religious notions were not dissimilar.      Sec.1. _The Algonkin Myth of Michabo._    Among all the Algonkin tribes whose myths have been preserved we find much  is said about a certain Giant Rabbit, to whom all sorts of powers were  attributed. He was the master of all animals; he was the teacher who first  instructed men in the arts of fishing and hunting; he imparted to the  Algonkins the mysteries of their religious rites; he taught them picture  writing and the interpretation of dreams; nay, far more than that, he was  the original ancestor, not only of their nation, but of the whole race of  man, and, in fact, was none other than the primal Creator himself, who  fashioned the earth and gave life to all that thereon is.    Hearing all this said about such an ignoble and weak animal as the rabbit,  no wonder that the early missionaries and travelers spoke of such fables  with undisguised contempt, and never mentioned them without excuses for  putting on record trivialities so utter.    Yet it appears to me that under these seemingly weak stories lay a  profound truth, the appreciation of which was lost in great measure to the  natives themselves, but which can be shown to have been in its origin a  noble myth, setting forth in not unworthy images the ceaseless and mighty  rhythm of nature in the alternations of day and night, summer and winter,  storm and sunshine.    I shall quote a few of these stories as told by early authorities, not  adding anything to relieve their crude simplicity, and then I will see  whether, when submitted to the test of linguistic analysis, this  unpromising ore does not yield the pure gold of genuine mythology.    The beginning of things, according to the Ottawas and other northern  Algonkins, was at a period when boundless waters covered the face of the  earth. On this infinite ocean floated a raft, upon which were many species  of animals, the captain and chief of whom was Michabo, the Giant Rabbit.  They ardently desired land on which to live, so this mighty rabbit ordered  the beaver to dive and bring him up ever so little a piece of mud. The  beaver obeyed, and remained down long, even so that he came up utterly  exhausted, but reported that he had not reached bottom. Then the Rabbit  sent down the otter, but he also returned nearly dead and without success.  Great was the disappointment of the company on the raft, for what better  divers had they than the beaver and the otter?    In the midst of their distress the (female) muskrat came forward and  announced her willingness to make the attempt. Her proposal was received  with derision, but as poor help is better than none in an emergency, the  Rabbit gave her permission, and down she dived. She too remained long,  very long, a whole day and night, and they gave her up for lost. But at  length she floated to the surface, unconscious, her belly up, as if dead.  They hastily hauled her on the raft and examined her paws one by one. In  the last one of the four they found a small speck of mud. Victory! That  was all that was needed. The muskrat was soon restored, and the Giant  Rabbit, exerting his creative power, moulded the little fragment of soil,  and as he moulded it, it grew and grew, into an island, into a mountain,  into a country, into this great earth that we all dwell upon. As it grew  the Rabbit walked round and round it, to see how big it was; and the story  added that he is not yet satisfied; still he continues his journey and his  labor, walking forever around and around the earth and ever increasing it  more and more.    The animals on the raft soon found homes on the new earth. But it had yet  to be covered with forests, and men were not born. The Giant Rabbit formed  the trees by shooting his arrows into the soil, which became tree trunks,  and, transfixing them with other arrows, these became branches; and as for  men, some said he formed them from the dead bodies of certain animals,  which in time became the \"totems\" of the Algonkin tribes; but another and  probably an older and truer story was that he married the muskrat which  had been of such service to him, and from this union were born the  ancestors of the various races of mankind which people the earth.    Nor did he neglect the children he had thus brought into the world of his  creation. Having closely studied how the spider spreads her web to catch  flies, he invented the art of knitting nets for fish, and taught it to his  descendants; the pieces of native copper found along the shores of Lake  Superior he took from his treasure house inside the earth, where he  sometimes lives. It is he who is the Master of Life, and if he appears in  a dream to a person in danger, it is a certain sign of a lucky escape. He  confers fortune in the chase, and therefore the hunters invoke him, and  offer him tobacco and other dainties, placing them in the clefts of rocks  or on isolated boulders. Though called the Giant Rabbit, he is always  referred to as a man, a giant or demigod perhaps, but distinctly as of  human nature, the mighty father or elder brother of the race.[1]    [Footnote 1: The writers from whom I have taken this myth are Nicolas  Perrot, _Memoire sur les Meurs, Coustumes et Relligion des Sauvages de  l'Amerique Septentrionale_, written by an intelligent layman who lived  among the natives from 1665 to 1699; and the various _Relations des  Jesuites_, especially for the years 1667 and 1670.]    Such is the national myth of creation of the Algonkin tribes, as it has  been handed down to us in fragments by those who first heard it. Has it  any meaning? Is it more than the puerile fable of savages? "]]]
