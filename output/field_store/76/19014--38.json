As a consequence of the edict, the whole region  of the Aures had been in revolution. The Bishop of Bagai, fortified in  his episcopal city and basilica, had stood an actual siege from the Roman  troops. Almost everywhere the struggle between Donatists and Catholics  still went on below the surface. There cannot be the least doubt that  Thagaste took its share in these quarrels. To those who urged him to be  baptized, the father of Augustin might well answer with ironic politeness:  \"I am only waiting till you agree among yourselves, to see where the truth  lies.\" In his heart this rather lukewarm pagan had no inveterate dislike to  Christianity.    What proves it at once is that he married a Christian.    How did Monnica become the wife of Patricius? How did these two beings, so  little alike, between whom there was such a great difference of age, not to  mention all the rest, come to join their fate? Those are questions which  it would never have occurred to the people of Thagaste to ask. Patricius  married to be like everybody else--and also because he was well over forty,  and his mother an old woman who would soon be no longer able to run his  house.    Monnica also had her mother. The two old women had a meeting, with many  politenesses and ceremonious bowings, and because the thing appeared to  them reasonable and most suitable, they settled the marriage. Had Patricius  ever seen the girl that he was going to take, according to custom, so as to  have a child-bearer and housewife? It is quite likely he had not. Was she  pretty, rich, or poor? He considered such matters as secondary, since the  marriage was not a love-match but a traditional duty to fulfil. If the  union was respectable, that was quite enough. But however the matter fell  out, what is certain is that Monnica was very young. She was twenty-two  when Augustin was born, and he was probably not her first child. We know  that she was hardly marriageable when she was handed over, as Arab parents  do to-day with their adolescent or little girls, to the man who was going  to marry her. Now in Africa girls become marriageable at a very early age.  They are married at fourteen, sometimes even at twelve. Perhaps she was  seventeen or eighteen at most when she married Patricius. She must have had  first a son, Navigius, whom we shall meet later on at Milan, and also a  daughter, of whom we do not even know the name, but who became a nun, and  superior of a convent in the diocese of Hippo. For us the features of these  two other children of Monnica and Patricius are obliterated. They are  concealed by the radiance of their illustrious great brother.    Monnica was fond of telling stories of her girlhood to her son. He has  handed down some of them to us.    She was brought up strictly, according to the system of that time. Both her  parents came of families which had been Christian, and Catholic-Christian,  for many generations. They had never been carried away by the Donatist  schism; they were people very obstinate in their convictions--a character  quite as frequent in Africa as its opposite, the kind of Numidian or Moor,  who is versatile and flighty. It is not unimportant that Augustin came from  this hard-headed race, for this it was, with the aid of God's grace, that  saved him--the energetic temper of his will.    Still, if the faith of the young Monnica was confirmed from her earliest  years, it is not so much to the lessons of her mother that she owed it,  as to the training of an old woman-servant of whom she always spoke with  gratitude. In the family of her master, this old woman had a place like the  one which to-day in a Turkish family is held by the nurse, the _dada_, who  is respected by all the harem and all the household. Doubtless she herself  was born in the house and had seen all the children born. She had carried  Monnica's father on her back when he was little, just as the Kabylian  women or the Bedouin nomads carry their babies still. She was a devoted  slave, just a bit unreasonable--a veritable housedog who in the zeal of  guardianship barks more than is necessary at the stranger who passes. She  was like the negress in the Arab houses to-day, who is often a better  Muslem, more hostile to the Christian, than her employers. The old woman  in Monnica's family had witnessed the last persecutions; she had perhaps  visited the confessors in prison; perhaps she had seen flow the blood of  the martyrs. These exciting and terrible scenes would have been graven on  her memory. What inflamed stories the old servant must have told her young  mistresses, what vital lessons of constancy and heroism! Monnica listened  to them eagerly.    Because of her great faith, this simple slave was revered as a saint by  her owners, who entrusted her with the supervision of their daughters. She  proved a stern governess, who would stand no trifling with her rules. She  prevented these girls from drinking even water except at meals. Cruel  suffering for little Africans! Thagaste is not far from the country of  thirst. But the old woman said to them:    \"You drink water now because you can't get at the wine. In time to come,  when you are married and have bins and cellars of your own, you'll turn up  your nose at water, and your habit of drinking will be too much for you.\"    Monnica came near fulfilling the prophecy of the honest woman. It was  before she was married. As she was very well-behaved and very temperate,  she used to be sent to the cellar to draw the wine from the cask. Before  pouring it into the flagon she would sip just a little. Being unaccustomed  to wine, she was not able to drink more; it was too strong for her gullet.  She did this, not because she liked the wine, but from naughtiness, to play  a trick on her parents who trusted her, and also, of course, because it was  prohibited. Each time she swallowed a little more, and so it went on till  she ended by finding it rather nice, and came to drinking greedily one  cup after another. One day a slave-girl, who went with her to the cellar,  began to grumble. Monnica gave her a sharp answer. Upon this the girl  called Monnica a drunkard.... Drunkard! This bitter taunt so humiliated the  self-respect of the future saint, that she got the better of her taste for  drink. Augustin does not say it was through piety she did this, but because  she felt the ugliness of such a vice.    There is a certain roughness in this story of childhood, the roughness of  ancient customs, with which is always mingled some decency or dignity.  Christianity did the work of polishing the soul of Monnica. At the time we  are dealing with, if she was already a very devout young girl, she was far  as yet from being the grand Christian that she became afterwards.    When she married Patricius she was a girl very reserved and cold to all  appearances (in reality, she was very passionate), precise in attending to  her religious duties, even a little strict, with her exaggeration of the  Christian austerity in her hate of all the brutalities and all the careless  morals that paganism condoned. Nevertheless, this rigid soul knew how to  bend when it was necessary. Monnica had tact, suppleness, and, when it  was needed, a very acute and very reasonable practical sense of which she  gave many a proof in the bringing up and management of her son Augustin.  This soul, hard for herself, veiled her uncompromising religion under an  unchangeable sweetness which was in her rather the work of grace than a  natural gift.    There can be little doubt that her behaviour and character greatly  disturbed Patricius at the beginning of their married life. Perhaps he  regretted the marriage. What use had he for this nun alongside of him!  Both of them must have suffered the usual annoyances which always appeared  before long in unions of this kind between pagan and Christian. True, it  was no longer the time of Tertullian, the heroic century of persecutions,  when the Christian women glided into the prisons to kiss the shackles of  the martyrs. (What a revenge did woman take then for her long and enforced  confinement to the women's apartments! And how outrageous such conduct must  have seemed to a husband brought up in the Roman way!) But the practices  of the Christian life established a kind of intermittent divorce between  husbands and wives of different religion. Monnica often went out, either  alone, or accompanied by a faithful bondwoman. She had to attend the  services of the Church, to go about the town visiting the poor and giving  alms. And there were the fast-days which occurred two or three times a  week, and especially the long fast of Lent--a grievous nuisance when the  husband wanted to give a dinner-party just on those particular days! On  the vigil of festivals, Monnica would spend a good part of the night in  the Basilica. Regularly, doubtless on Sundays, she betook herself to the  cemetery, or to some chapel raised to the memory of a martyr who was often  buried there--in fact, they called these chapels \"Memorials\" (_memoriae_).    There were many of these chapels--even too many in the opinion of austere  Christians. Monnica went from one to another carrying in a large basket  made of willow branches some pieces of minced meat, bread, and wine mixed  with water. She met her friends in these places. They would sit down around  the tombs, of which some were shaped like tables, unpack the provisions,  and eat and drink piously in honour of the martyr. This was a residue  of pagan superstition among the Christians. These pious _agapae_, or  love-feasts, often turned into disgusting orgies. When Augustin became  Bishop of Hippo he had considerable trouble to get his people out of the  habit of them. Notwithstanding his efforts, the tradition still lasts.  Every Friday the Muslem women keep up the custom of visiting the cemeteries  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9090"],[0,"Germania and Agricola (#4)"],[1,"and strong light the  outward actions, but we look into the hearts of all the mixed multitude,  and gaze with wonder on the changing emotions and conflicting passions by  which they are agitated.    His delineations of individual character are also marked by the same  profound insight into the human soul. Like the old Latin Poet, he might  have said,        \"Homo sum; nihil _humani_ a me alienum puto.\"    There is scarcely a landscape picture in his whole gallery. It is full of  portraits of _men_, in groups and as individuals, every grade of  condition, every variety of character, performing all kinds of actions,  exhibiting every human passion, the colors laid on with a bold hand, the  principal features presented in a strong light, the minuter strokes  omitted, the soft and delicate finish despised. We feel, that we have  gained not a little insight into the character of those men, who are  barely introduced in the extant books of Tacitus, but whose history is  given in the books that are lost. Men of inferior rank even, who appear  on the stage only for a short time, develope strongly marked characters,  which are drawn with dramatic distinctness and power, while yet the  thread of history is never broken, the dignity of history never  sacrificed. And those Emperors, whose history is preserved entire,--with  them we feel acquainted, we know the controlling principles, as well as  the leading events of their lives, and we feel sure that we could predict  how they would act, under almost any imaginable circumstances.    In a faithful portraiture of the private and public life of the  degenerate Romans, there was much to call for the hand of a master in  _satire_. And we find in the glowing sketches of our author, all the  vigor and point of a Juvenal, without his vulgarity and obscenity; all  the burning indignation which the Latin is so peculiarly capable of  expressing, with all the vigor and stateliness by which the same language  is equally characterized. Tacitus has been sometimes represented as a  very Diogenes, for carping and sarcasm--a very Aristophanes, to blacken  character with ridicule and reproach. But he is as far removed from the  cynic or the buffoon, as from the panegyrist or the flatterer. He is not  the indiscriminate admirer that Plutarch was. Nor is he such a universal  hater as Sallust. It is the fault of the times that he is obliged to deal  so much in censure. If there ever were perfect monsters on earth, such  were several of the Roman Emperors. Yet Tacitus describes few, if any, of  them without some of the traits of humanity. He gives us in his history  neither demons nor gods, but veritable men and women. In this respect, as  also in his descriptions of battles, Tacitus is decidedly superior to  Livy. The characters of Livy are distinguishable only as classes--the  good all very good, the bad very bad, the indifferent very indifferent.  You discover no important difference between a Fabius and a Marcellus,  further than it lies on the face of their actions. In Tacitus, the  characters are all individuals. Each stands out distinctly from the  surrounding multitude, and not only performs his own proper actions, but  is governed by his own peculiar motives. Livy places before us the  statues of heroes and gods; Tacitus conducts us through the crowd of  living men.    In an attempt to sketch the most striking features of Tacitus, as a  writer, no critic can omit to mention his sage and pithy maxims.  Apothegms abound on every page--sagacious, truthful, and profound in  sentiment, in style concise, antithetic and sententious. Doubtless he is  excessively fond of pointed antithesis. Perhaps he is too much given to  moralizing and reflection. It was, as we have said, the fault of his age.  But no one, who is familiar with Seneca, will severely censure Tacitus.  He will only wonder that he should have risen so far above the faults of  his contemporaries. Indeed, Tacitus interweaves his reflections with so  much propriety, and clothes his apothegms with so much dignity--he is so  manifestly competent to instruct the world by maxims, whether in civil,  social, or individual life, that we are far from wishing he had indulged  in it less. His reflections do not interrupt the thread of his narrative.  They grow naturally out of his incidents. They break forth spontaneously  from the lips of his men. His history is indeed philosophy teaching by  examples; and his pithy sayings are truly lessons of wisdom, embodied in  the form most likely to strike the attention, and impress the memory. We  should love to see a collection of apothegms from the pen of Tacitus. It  would make an admirable book of laconics. No book would give you more  ideas in fewer words. Nowhere could you gain so much knowledge, and lose  so little time. The reader of Tacitus, who will study him with pen in  hand, to mark, or refer to the most striking passages, will soon find  himself master of a text book in moral and political science, we might  say a text book in human nature, singularly concise and sententious, and  what is not always true even of concise and sententious writers, as  singularly wise and profound. In such a book, many of the _speeches_  would find a place entire; for many of them are little else than a series  of condensed, well-timed, and most instructive apothegms. [E.g. the  speech of Galba to Piso. His. i. 15, 16.]    But the scholar, who is on the lookout, will find lurking in every  section, and almost every sentence, some important truth in morals, in  politics, in the individual or social nature of man. Neither the editor  nor the teacher can be expected to develope these sentiments, nor even,  in many instances, to point them out. That labor must be performed by the  scholar; and his will be the reward.    No hasty perusal, no single reading of Tacitus, will give a just  conception of the surpassing richness of his works. They must be studied  profoundly to be duly appreciated. They are a mine of wisdom, of vast  extent and unknown depth, whose treasures lie chiefly beneath the  surface, imbedded in the solid rock which must be entered with mining  implements, explored with strong lights, and its wealth brought up by  severe toil and sweat.
