The arrangement of 1833, as far as  regards the transition or intermediate state, had been made under an  error in fact, an error propagated by the representations of the  masters. That error was now at an end, and an immediate alteration of  the provisions to which it had given rise was thus a matter of strict  justice;--not to mention that the planters had failed to perform their  part of the contract. The Colonial Assemblies had, except in Antigua,  done nothing for the slave in return for the large sum bestowed upon the  West India body. So that in any view there was an end of all pretext for  the further delay of right and justice.    The ground now taken by the whole Abolitionists; therefore, both in and  out of Parliament was, that the two years which remained of the  indentured apprenticeship must immediately be cut off, and freedom given  to the slaves in August, 1838, instead of 1840; The peace of the West  Indian community, and the real interests of the planters, were affirmed  to be as much concerned in this change as the rights of the negroes  themselves. Far from preparing them for becoming peaceable subjects and  contented members of society at the end of their apprenticeship, those  two years of compulsory labour would, it was justly observed, be a  period of heart-burning and discontent between master and servant, which  must, in the mean while, be dangerous to the peace of society, and must  leave, at the end of the time, a feeling of mutual ill-will and  distrust. The question could no longer be kept from the cognizance of  the negro people. Indeed, their most anxious expectations were already  pointed towards immediate liberty, and their strongest feelings were  roused to obtain it.    Of these sentiments the whole community partook; meetings were  everywhere held; petitions crowded the tables of Parliament; the press  poured forth innumerable tracts which were eagerly received; the pulpit  lent its aid to this holy cause; and discussions upon petitions and upon  incidental motions shook the walls of Parliament, while they stimulated  the zeal of the people. The Government adopted an unfortunate course,  which contributed greatly to weaken their hold on the confidence and  affections of the country; they resisted all the motions that were made  on behalf of the slaves, and appeared to regard only the interests of  the master, turning a deaf ear to the arguments of right and of justice.    It was found, during the course of these debates, that a new Slave Trade  had sprung up in the East Indies, with the sanction of an English Order  in Council. Under pretence that hands were wanted to cultivate their  estates, the Demerara planters had obtained permission to import what  they termed, with a delicacy borrowed from the vocabulary of the African  Slave Trade, \"labourers\" from Asia and from Africa east of the Cape, and  to make them Indentured Apprentices for a term of years. No restrictions  whatever were imposed by this unheard-of Order. No tonnage was required  in proportion to the numbers shipped, no amount of provision, no medical  assistance; no precautions were taken, or so much as thought of, to  prevent kidnapping and fraud, nay, to prevent main force being used in  any part of Eastern Africa, or of all Asia, in carrying on board the  victims of West Indian avarice; in short, a worse Slave Trade than the  African was established, and all the dominions of the East India  Company, with all the African and Asiatic coasts, as yet independent,  were given over to its ravages. This was repeatedly denounced by Lord  Brougham in the House of Lords; and although his motion for rescinding  the order was supported by Lord Lyndhurst, Lord Ellenborough, and Lord  Wharncliffe, the influence of the Government and the planters prevailed,  and the House rejected it. A bill was afterwards brought in to check the  enormities complained of; but no remedy at all effectual is as yet  applied. The official documents, however, proved that already men had  been inveigled on board, by the agents of the Mauritius planters, in  different parts of the East, and that the mortality on that  comparatively short voyage exceeded even the dreadful waste of life  which had characterized, and impressed with marks of horrid atrocity,  the accursed Middle Passage.    This subject, as might well be expected, once more roused the energies  of Thomas Clarkson: he addressed an able and convincing letter to Lord  Brougham, his old friend and coadjutor in the sacred cause; and it was  printed and universally circulated. The subject still remains unsettled:  and the labours of the enlightened philanthropist cannot now be directed  to one more important, or more urgent.    Meanwhile, in the spring of 1838, the question of Immediate Emancipation  was agitated throughout the country. The Government proved hostile.  Immense meetings were held at Exeter Hall, which were attended by many  members of Parliament, over which Lord Brougham presided. Among others  who were present and bore a distinguished part, were certain  representatives of Ireland who promised their strenuous support. It is a  painful duty to add, that their fellow-members from Ireland did not, on  this great occasion, follow their good example; for eleven only of  those, on whose votes reliance had been placed, opposed the Government,  while no less than twenty-seven gave them support.    The question was rejected by the House of Lords, when brought forward by  Lord Brougham; but in spite of the efforts of the Government; the  defalcation of the Irish, of a still greater proportion of the Scotch  representatives, two hundred and seventeen members of the House of  Commons voted for Immediate Abolition, out of four hundred and  eighty-nine who were present on the occasion. A second effort in the  same session placed Ministers in a minority; but they immediately gave  notice, they should strenuously oppose any attempt to carry into  practical effect this decision of the House; and in this determination  they were supported by a majority on a third division.    The word, however, had gone forth all over England, that the _Slave  should be free_. It had not only pervaded Europe, it had reached  America; and the West Indians at length perceived that they could no  longer resist the voice of the British people, when it spoke the accents  of humanity and of justice. The slaves would have met the dawn of the  first of August,--the day which all the motions in Parliament and all  the prayers of the petitions had fixed,--with perfect quiet, but with a  resolute determination to do no work. The peace would not have been  broken, but no more would a clod have been turned after that appointed  sun had risen. A handful of whites surrounded by myriads of  negroes,--now substantially free, and free without a blow,--must have  been overwhelmed in an hour after sunrise on that day, had they  resisted. The Colonial Legislatures, therefore, _now_ listened to the  voice of reason, and they, one after another, emancipated their slaves.  The first of August saw not a bondsman, under whatever appellation, in  any part of the Western Sea which owns the British rule.    The Mauritius, however, still held out, and on the Mauritius the hand of  the Imperial Parliament must and will be laid, to enforce mercy and  justice on those to whom mercy and justice have so long called aloud in  vain. In truth, if the case for instant emancipation was strong  everywhere, it was in no quarter half so strong as in the Mauritius; and  the distribution of the grant by Parliament to this Colony was the most  unjustifiable, and even incomprehensible. For, elsewhere, there existed  at least a title to the slave, over whom an unjust and unchristian law  recognised the right of property. But in the Mauritius there was not,  nor is there now, one negro to whom a good title is clearly provable.  The atrocious conduct of Governors and other functionaries, in conniving  at the Slave Trade of Eastern Africa, had filled that Colony with  thousands of negroes, every one of whom was carried there by the  commission of felony, long after Slave Trading had been declared a  capital crime by the law of the land, as by the law of nature it always  was. Sir George Murray, when Colonial Secretary of State, had admitted,  that at least thirty thousand of the negroes in the settlement were  nominally slaves, but in reality free, having been carried thither  contrary to law. He understated it by twenty thousand or more: yet on  all these negroes, in respect of property, were two millions and more  claimed: for all these the compensation money was given and taken, which  Parliament had lavishly bestowed. How then was it possible to doubt,  that every slave in the Mauritius should receive his freedom, when the  only ground alleged for not singling out and liberating this fifty  thousand, was the inability to distinguish them from the rest? If ten  men are tried for an offence, and it is clear that five are innocent,  though you cannot distinguish them from their companions, what jury will  hesitate in acquitting the whole, on the ordinary principle of its being  better five guilty should escape than five guiltless suffer? The same is  still the state of the case in that most criminal settlement, which,  having far surpassed all others in the enormity of its guilt, is now the  only one where no attempt has been made to evince repentance by  amendment of conduct. But the Government which has the power of  compelling justice will share the crime which they refuse to prevent,  and the Legislature must compel "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10635"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 2 (#5)"],[1,"swifter than the wind, an  enchanted sword, a golden lance, also enchanted, which overthrew all whom  it touched,[3] and a ring of a virtue so extraordinary, that if put into  the mouth, it rendered the person invisible, and if worn on the finger,  nullified every enchantment. But beyond even all this, he gave him his  sister for a companion; rightly judging, that every body that saw her  would fall into the proposal of the joust; and trusting that, at the  close of it, she would bring him the whole court of France into Cathay,  prisoners in her hands.    Such, Malagigi discovered, was the plot of the accursed infidel hound,  King Galafron.[4]    Meantime the pretended Uberto had returned to his station at the  Horseblock of Merlin. He had had a beautiful pavilion pitched there; and  under this pavilion he lay down awhile to refresh himself with sleep. His  sister Angelica lay down also, but in the open air, under the great pine  by the fountain. The four giants kept watch: and as she lay thus asleep,  with her fair head on the grass, she appeared like an angel come down  from heaven.    By this time Malagigi, borne by one of his demons, had arrived in the  same place. He saw the beauty asleep by the flowery water, and the four  giants all wide awake; and he said within his teeth,--\" Brute scoundrels,  I will take every one of you into my net without a blow.\"    Malagigi took his book, and cast a spell out of it; and in an instant  the whole four giants were buried in sleep. Then, drawing his sword, he  softly approached the young lady, intending to despatch her as quickly:  but seeing her look so lovely as she slept, he paused, and considered  within himself, and resolved to detain her in the same state by  enchantment, so long as it should please him. Laying down the naked sword  in the grass, he again took his book, and read and read on, and still  read on, and fancied he was locking up her senses all the while in a  sleep unwakeable. But the ring of which I have spoken was on her finger.  She had borrowed it of her brother; and a superior power rendered all  other magic of no avail. A touch from Malagigi to prove the force of his  spell awoke her, to the magician's consternation, with a great cry. She  fled into the arms of her brother, whom it aroused; and, by the help of  his sister's knowledge of enchantment, Argalia mastered and bound the  magician. The book was then turned against him, and the place was  suddenly filled with a crowd of his own demons, every one of them crying  out to Angelica, \"What commandest thou?\"    \"Take this man,\" said Angelica, \"and bear him prisoner to the great city  between Tartary and India, where my father Galafron is lord. Present him  to him in my name, and say it was I that took him; and add, that having  so taken the master of the book, I care not for all the other lords of  the court of Charlemagne.\"    At the end of these words, and at one and the same instant, the magician  was conveyed to the feet of Galafron in Cathay, and locked up in a rock  under the sea.    In due time the enamoured knights, according to agreement, came to the  spot, for the purpose of jousting with the supposed Uberto, each anxious  to have the first encounter, particularly Orlando, in order that he might  not see the beauty carried off by another. But they were obliged to draw  lots; and thirty other names appeared before his, the first of which was  that of Astolfo the Englishman.    Now Astolfo was son of the king of England; and as I said before, he was  the handsomest man in the world. He was also very rich and well bred, and  loved to dress well, and was as brave as he was handsome; but his success  was not always equal to his bravery. He had a trick of being thrown from  his horse, a failing which he was accustomed to attribute to accident;  and then he would mount again, and be again thrown from the saddle, in  the boldest manner conceivable.    This gallant prince was habited, on the present occasion, in arms worth a  whole treasury. His shield had a border of large pearls; his mail was of  gold; on his helmet was a ruby as big as a chestnut; and his horse was  covered with a cloth all over golden leopards.[5] He issued to the  combat, looking at nobody and fearing nothing; and on his sounding  the horn to battle, Argalia came forth to meet him. After courteous  salutations, the two combatants rushed together; but the moment the  Englishman was touched with the golden lance, his legs flew over his  head.    \"Cursed fortune!\" cried he, as he lay on the grass; \"this is out of all  calculation. But it was entirely owing to the saddle. You can't but  acknowledge, that if I had kept my seat, the beautiful lady would have  been mine. But thus it is when Fortune chooses to befriend infidels!\"[6]    The four giants, who had by this time been disenchanted out of their  sleep by Angelica, took up the English prince, and put him in the  pavilion. But when he was stripped of his armour, he looked so handsome,  that the lovely stranger secretly took pity on him, and bade them shew  him all the courtesies that captivity allowed. He was permitted to walk  outside by the fountain; and Angelica, from a dark corner, looked at him  with admiration, as he walked up and down in the moonlight.[7]    The violent Ferragus had the next chance in the encounter, and was thrown  no less speedily than Astolfo; but he did not so easily put up with the  mischance. Crying out, \"What are the emperor's engagements to me?\" he  rushed with his sword against Argalia, who, being forced to defend himself  unexpectedly, dismounted and set aside his lance, and got so much the  worse of the fight, that he listened to proposals of marriage from  Ferragus to his sister. The beauty, however, not feeling an inclination  to match with so rough and savage-looking a person, was so dismayed at  the offer, that, hastily bidding her brother meet her in the forest of  Arden, she vanished from the sight of both, by means of the enchanted  ring. Argalia, seeing this, took to his horse of swiftness, and dashed  away in the same direction; Ferragus, in distraction, pursued Argalia;  and Astolfo, thus left to himself, took possession of the golden lance,  and again issued forth--not, indeed, with quite his usual confidence of  the result, but determined to run all risks, in any thing that might  ensue, for the sake of the emperor. In fine, to cut this part of the  history short, Charlemagne, finding the lady and her brother gone,  ordered the joust to be restored to its first intention; and Astolfo,  who was as ignorant as the others of the treasure he possessed in the  enchanted lance, unhorsed all comers against him like so many children,  equally to their astonishment and his own.    The Paladin Rinaldo now learnt the issue of the fight between Ferragus  and the stranger, and galloped in a loving agony of pursuit after  the fair fugitive. Orlando learnt the disappearance of Rinaldo, and,  distracted with jealousy, pushed forth in like manner; and at length all  three are in the forest of Arden, hunting about for her who is invisible.    Now in this forest were two enchanted waters, the one a running stream,  and the other a built fountain; the first caused every body who tasted it  to fall in love, and the other (so to speak) to fall _out_ of love; say,  rather, to feel the love turned into hate. To the latter of these two  waters Rinaldo happened to come; and being flushed with heat and anxiety,  he dismounted from his horse, and quenched, in one cold draught, both his  thirst and his passion. So far from loving Angelica as before, or holding  her beauty of any account, he became disgusted with its pursuit, nay,  hated her from the bottom of his heart; and so, in this new state of  mind, and with feelings of lofty contempt, he remounted and rode away,  and happened to come on the bank of the running stream. There, enticed by  the beauty of the place, which was all sweet meadow-ground and bowers of  trees, he again quitted his saddle, and, throwing himself on the ground,  fell fast asleep. Unfortunately for the proud beauty Angelica, or rather  in just punishment for her contempt, her palfrey conducted her to this  very place. The water tempted her to drink, and, dismounting and tying  the animal to one of the trees, she did so, and then cast her eyes on the  sleeping Rinaldo. Love instantly seized her, and she stood rooted to the  spot.    The meadow round about was all full of lilies of the valley and wild  roses. Angelica, not knowing what to do, at length plucked a quantity  of these, and with her white hand she dropped them on the face of the  sleeper. He woke up; and seeing who it was, not only received her  salutations with a change of countenance, but remounting his horse,  galloped away through the thickest part of the forest. In vain the  beautiful creature followed and called after him; in vain asked him what  she had done to be so despised, and entreated him, at any rate, to take  care how he went so fast. Rinaldo disappeared, leaving her to wring her  hands in despair; and she returned in tears to the spot on which she had  found him sleeping. There, in her turn, she herself lay down, pressing  the spot of earth on which he had lain; and so, weeping and lamenting,  yet blessing every flower and bit of grass that he had touched, fell  asleep out of fatigue and sorrow.    As Angelica thus lay, the good or bad fortune of Orlando conducted him to  the same place. The attitude in which she was sleeping was so lovely  that it is not even to be conceived, much less expressed. The very grass  seemed to flower on all sides of her for joy; and the stream, as it  murmured along, to go talking of love.[8] Orlando stood gazing like a man  who had been transported to another sphere. \"Am I on earth,\" thought he,  \"or am I in paradise? Surely it is I myself that am sleeping, and this is  my dream.\"    But his dream was proved to be"]]]
