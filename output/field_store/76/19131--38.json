Around the cover is engraved the following  inscription:--\"_Presented by the Cymmrodorion in Gwynedd, to_ RICHARD  PHILLIPS JONES, M.D. _for his unwearied exertions in promoting the Royal  Eisteddvod, held at Denbigh_, 1828.\" The horn (the inside of which is  lined with silver,) will contain about three half pints; and we doubt not  that it will be often passed around, filled with _Cwrw da_, in  remembrance of the interesting event which it is intended to  commemorate--        \"And former times renew in converse sweet.\"    The origin of the _Hirlas Horn_ is as follows:--    About 1160, Owain Cyveiliog, one of the most distinguished Princes of  Powis, flourished; he was a great warrior and an eminent poet; several  specimens of his writings are given in the _Archaiology of Wales_,  published by the late patriotic Owain Jones Myfyr. His poem called the  _Hirlas Horn_ (the long blue horn,) is a masterpiece. It used to be the  custom with the prince, when he had gained a battle, to call for the  horn, filled with metheglin, or mead, and drink the contents at one  draught, then sound it to show that there was no deception; each of his  officers following his example. Mrs. Hemans has given a beautiful song,  in Parry's second volume of _Welsh Melodies_, on the subject, concluding  thus:--        \"Fill higher the HIRLAS' forgetting not those      Who shar'd its bright draught in the days which are fled!    Tho' cold on their mountains the valiant repose,      Their lot shall be lovely--renown to the dead!    While harps in the hall of the feast shall be strung,      While regal ERYRI[3] with snow shall be crown'd--    So long by the bard shall their battles be sung,      And the heart of the hero shall burn at the sound:    The free winds of Cambria shall swell with their name,    And OWAIN's rich HIRLAS be fill'd to their fame!\"        [3] Snowdon.           *       *       *       *       *      THE NATURALIST.             *       *       *       *       *      BIRDS OF LONDON.      It may be observed, that although many of the bird tribe seem to prefer  the vicinity of the residence of man for their domicile, yet they, for  the most part, avoid cities and large towns, for one, among other  reasons, because there is no food for them. There are, notwithstanding,  some remarkable exceptions to this. The _House Sparrow_ is to be seen, I  believe, in every part of London. There is a rookery in the Tower; and  another was, till lately, in Carlton Palace Gardens; but the trees having  been cut down to make room for the improvements going on there, the rooks  removed in (1827,) to some trees behind the houses in New-street,  Spring-gardens. There was also, for many years, a rookery on the trees in  the churchyard of St. Dunstan's in the East, a short distance from the  Tower; the rooks for some years past deserted that spot, owing, it is  believed, to the fire that occurred a few years ago at the old Custom  House. But in 1827, they began again to build on those trees, which are  not elm, but a species of plane. There was also, formerly, a rookery on  some large elm trees in the College Garden behind the Ecclesiastical  Court in Doctors' Commons, a curious anecdote concerning which has been  recorded.    The _Stork_, and some other of the tribe of waders, are occasionally also  inhabitants of some of the continental towns.    Rooks appear to be peculiarly partial to building their nests in the  vicinity of the residence of man. Of the numerous rookeries of which I  have any recollection, most of them were a short distance from dwelling  houses. In March, 1827, there was a rookery on some trees, neither very  lofty nor very elegant, in the garden of the Royal Naval Asylum, at  Greenwich; and although many very fine and lofty elms are in the park  near, which one might naturally suppose the rooks would prefer, yet, such  is the fact, there is not even one rook's nest in Greenwich Park.  Possibly the company of so large a number of boys, and the noise which  they make, determine these birds in the choice of such a place for their  procreating domicile.    There is also a remarkable fact related by Mr. French, on the authority  of Dr. Spurgin, in the second volume of the _Zoological Journal_, which  merits attention, in regard to the rook.    A gentleman occupied a farm in Essex, where he had not long resided  before numerous rooks built their nests on the trees surrounding his  premises; the rookery was much prized; the farmer, however, being induced  to hire a larger farm about three quarters of a mile distant, he left the  farm and the rookery; but, to his surprise and pleasure, the whole  rookery deserted their former habitation and came to the new one of their  old master, where they continue to flourish. It ought to be added, that  this gentleman was strongly attached to all animals whatsoever, and of  course used them kindly.    The _Swallow_, _Swift_, and _Martin_, seem to have almost deserted  London, although they are occasionally, though not very plentifully, to  be seen in the suburbs. Two reasons may be assigned for this relative to  the swallow; flies are not there so plentiful as in the open country; and  most of the chimneys have conical or other contracted tops to them,  which, if they do not preclude, are certainly no temptation to their  building in such places; the top of a chimney being, as is well known,  its favourite site for its nest. The _Martin_ is also scarce in London.  But, during the summer of 1820, I observed a _Martin's_ nest against a  blind window in Goswell Street Road, on the construction of which the  _Martins_ were extremely busy in the early part of the month of August. I  have since seen many _Martins_, (August, 1826,) busily engaged in  skimming over a pool in the fields, to the south of Islington: most of  these were, I conjecture, young birds, as they were brown, not black; but  they had the _white_ on the rump, which is characteristic of the species.  A few days afterwards I observed several _Martin's_ nests in a blind  window on Islington-Green. And, Sept. 20, of the same year, I saw from  the window of my present residence, in Dalby Terrace, City Road, many  similar birds actively on the wing.    The _Redbreast_ has been, I am told, occasionally seen in the  neighbourhood of Fleet-market and Ludgate-hill. I saw it myself before  the window of my present residence, Dalby Terrace, in November, 1825, and  in Nov. 1826, the _Wren_ was seen on the shrubs in the garden before the  house at Dalby Terrace; it was very lively and active, and uttered its  peculiar _chit, chit_.    The _Starling_ builds on the tower at Canonbury, in Islington; and the  _Baltimore Oriole_ is, according to Wilson, found very often on the trees  in some of the American cities; but the _Mocking-bird_, that used to be  very common in the American suburban regions, is, it is said, now  becoming more rare, particularly in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia.    The _Thrush_ was also often heard in the gardens behind York-place,  during the spring of 1826. I heard it myself in delightful song early in  March, 1826, among the trees near the canal, on the north side of the  Regent's Park.    Some of the migratory birds approach much nearer to London than is  generally imagined. The _Cuckoo_ and _Wood-pigeon_ are heard occasionally  in Kensington-gardens. The _Nightingale_ approaches also much nearer to  London than has been commonly supposed. I heard it in melodious song at  seven o'clock in the morning, in the wood near Hornsey-wood House, May  10, 1826, which is, I believe, the nearest approach to St. Paul's it has  been for some time known to make. It is also often heard at Hackney and  Mile-end. I have also heard it regularly for some years past in a garden  near the turnpike-gate on the road leading from London to Greenwich, a  short distance from the third mile stone from London-Bridge. This  charming bird may be also heard, during the season, in Greenwich Park,  particularly in the gardens adjoining Montagu-house; but never, I  believe, on its lofty trees. The _Nightingale_ prefers copses and bushes  to trees; the _Cuckoo_, on the contrary, prefers trees, and of these the  elm, from which it most probably obtains its food. The _Nightingale_ is  also common at Lee and Lewisham, Forest-hill, Sydenham, and Penge-wood;  in all these places, except Hackney and Mile-end, I have myself often  heard it, and in the day-time. Those who are partial to the singing of  birds generally, will find the morning, from four to nine o'clock, the  most favourable time for hearing them----_Jennings's Ornithologia_.           *       *       *       *       *      MOCK SUNS.      In the centre of the heavens above us, the sun began to break through the  mist, forming a clear space, which, as it grew wider by the gradual  retreat of the mist and clouds, was enclosed or surrounded by a complete  circle of hazy light, much brighter than the general aspect of the  atmosphere, but not so brilliant as the sun itself. This circle was about  half as broad as the apparent size of the sun, through which it seemed to  pass, while on each side of the sun, at about the distance of a sixth of  the circumference of the ring, which likewise traversed them, were  situated two mock suns, resembling the real sun in everything but  brightness, and on the opposite side of the circle two other mock suns  were placed, distant from each other about a third of the circuit of the  band of light, forming altogether five suns, one real and four fictitious  luminaries, through which a broad hoop of subdued light ran round an area  of slightly hazy blue sky. The centre of this area was occupied by a  small segment of a rainbow, the concave side of which was turned from the  true sun, while on its convex edge, in contact with it at its most  prominent "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11741"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

QUEEN (_rising._)      'Tis proudly spoken; nobly too--but what--    What if a woman's hand were to bestow    Upon the Duke de Bourbon such high honours,    To raise him to such state, that grasping man,    E'en in his wildest thoughts of mad ambition,    Ne'er dreamt of a more glorious pinnacle?    BOURBON.      I'd kiss the lady's hand, an she were fair.    But if this world fill'd up the universe,--    If it could gather all the light that lives    In ev'ry other star or sun, or world;    If kings could be my subjects, and that I    Could call such pow'r and such a world my own,    I would not take it from a woman's hand.    Fame is my mistress, madam, and my sword    The only friend I ever wooed her with.    I hate all honours smelling of the distaff,    And, by this light, would as lief wear a spindle    Hung round my neck, as thank a lady's hand    For any favour greater than a kiss.--    QUEEN.      And how, if such a woman loved you,--how    If, while she crown'd your proud ambition, she    Could crown her own ungovernable passion,    And felt that all this earth possess'd, and she    Could give, were all too little for your love?    Oh good, my lord! there may be such a woman.    BOURBON (_aside._)      Amazement! can it be, sweet Margaret--    That she has read our love?--impossible!--and yet--    That lip ne'er wore so sweet a smile!--it is.    That look _is_ pardon and acceptance! (_aloud_)--      speak. (_He falls at the Queen's feet._)    Madam, in pity speak but one word more,--    Who is that woman?    QUEEN (_throwing off her veil._)      I am that woman!    BOURBON (_starting up._)      You, by the holy mass! I scorn your proffers;    Is there no crimson blush to tell of fame    And shrinking womanhood! Oh shame! shame! shame!    (_The Queen remains clasping her hands to her temples, while _De Bourbon_  walks hastily up and down; after a long pause the _Queen_ speaks._)    (_The _Queen_ summons her Confessor._)    _Enter _GONZALES.      Sir, we have business with this holy father;    You may retire.    BOURBON.      Confusion!    QUEEN.      Are we obeyed?    BOURBON (_aside._)      Oh Margaret!--for thee! for thy dear sake!      [_Rushes out. The _Queen_ sinks into a chair._]    QUEEN.      Refus'd and scorn'd!  Infamy!--the word chokes me!    How now! why stand'st thou gazing at me thus?    GONZALES.      I wait your highness' pleasure.--(_Aside_) So all is well--    A crown hath fail'd to tempt him--as I see    In yonder lady's eyes.    QUEEN.      Oh sweet revenge!    Thou art my only hope, my only dower,    And I will make thee worthy of a Queen.    Proud noble, I will weave thee such a web,--    I will so spoil and trample on thy pride,    That thou shalt wish the woman's distaff were    Ten thousand lances rather than itself.    Ha! waiting still, sir Priest! Well as them seest    Our venture hath been somewhat baulk'd,--'tis not    Each arrow readies swift and true the aim,--    Love having failed, we'll try the best expedient,    That offers next,--what sayst thou to revenge?    'Tis not so soft, but then 'tis very sure;    Say, shall we wring this haughty soul a little?    Tame this proud spirit, curb this untrain'd charger?    We will not weigh too heavily, nor grind    Too hard, but, having bow'd him to the earth,    Leave the pursuit to others--carrion birds,    Who stoop, but not until the falcon's gorg'd    Upon the prey he leaves to their base talons.    GONZALES.      It rests but with your grace to point the means.    QUEEN.      Where be the plans of those possessions    Of Bourbon's house?--see that thou find them straight:    His mother was my kinswoman, and I    Could aptly once trace characters like those    She used to write--enough--Guienne--Auvergne    And all Provence that lies beneath his claim,--    That claim disprov'd, of right belong to me.--    The path is clear, do thou fetch me those parchments.      [_Exit_ Gonzales.    Not dearer to my heart will be the day    When first the crown of France deck'd my son's forehead,    Than that when I can compass thy perdition,--    When I can strip the halo of thy fame    From off thy brow, seize on the wide domains,    That make thy hatred house akin to empire,    And give thy name to deathless infamy. [_Exit_.    The King holds a Council to appoint a successor to the Constable in Italy.  This scene is of stirring interest. The Queen goads the high-minded  Bourbon nigh unto madness, and at length breaks out into open insult.  Lautrec the brother of Francoise, and despised by Bourbon, is named the  governor. In the ceremony Francis addresses Lautrec:--    FRANCIS.      With our own royal hand we'll buckle on    The sword, that in thy grasp must be the bulwark    And lode-star of our host. Approach.    QUEEN.      Not so.    Your pardon, sir; but it hath ever been    The pride and privilege of woman's hand    To arm the valour that she loves so well:    We would not, for your crown's best jewel, bate    One jot of our accustom'd state to-day:    Count Lautrec, we will arm thee, at our feet:    Take thou the brand which wins thy country's wars,--    Thy monarch's trust, and thy fair lady's favour.    Why, how now!--how is this!--my lord of Bourbon!    If we mistake not, 'tis the sword of office    Which graces still your baldrick;--with your leave,    We'll borrow it of you.    BOURBON (_starting up_.)      Ay, madam, 'tis the sword    You buckled on with your own hand, the day    You sent me forth to conquer in your cause;    And there it is;--(_breaks the sword_)--take it--and with it all    Th' allegiance that I owe to France; ay take it;    And with it, take the hope I breathe o'er it:    That so, before Colonna's host, your arms    Lie crush'd and sullied with dishonour's stain;    So, reft in sunder by contending factions,    Be your Italian provinces; so torn    By discord and dissension this vast empire;    So broken and disjoin'd your subjects' loves;    So fallen your son's ambition, and your pride.    QUEEN (_rising_.)      What ho--a guard within there--Charles of Bourbon,    I do arrest thee, traitor to the crown.    _Enter Guard_.      Away with yonder wide-mouth'd thunderer;    We'll try if gyves and straight confinement cannot    Check this high eloquence, and cool the brain    Which harbours such unmannerd hopes.      [Bourbon _is forced out_.    Dream ye, my lords, that thus with open ears,    And gaping mouths and eyes, ye sit and drink    This curbless torrent of rebellious madness.    And you, sir, are you slumbering on your throne;    Or has all majesty fled from the earth,    That women must start up, and in your council    Speak, think, and act for ye; and, lest your vassals,    The very dirt beneath your feet, rise up    And cast ye off, must women, too, defend ye?    For shame, my lords, all, all of ye, for shame,--    Off, off with sword and sceptre, for there is    No loyalty in subjects; and in kings,    No king-like terror to enforce their rights.    Meanwhile Lautrec proposes to his sister Francoise, the hand of his friend,  the gallant Laval; whilst the fair maiden is importuned by Francis, who  endeavours to make the poet Clement Marot the bearer of his intrigue. In a  scene between Francis and the poet, the licentious impatience of the King,  and the unsullied honour of Clement are finely contrasted.    FRANCIS.      I would I'd borne the scroll myself, thy words    Image her forth so fair.    CLEMENT.      Do they, indeed?    Then sorrow seize my tongue, for, look you, sir,    I will not speak of your own fame or honour,    Nor of your word to me: king's words, I find,    Are drafts on our credulity, not pledges    Of their own truth. You have been often pleas'd    To shower your royal favours on my head;    And fruitful honours from your kindly will    Have rais'd me far beyond my fondest hopes;    But had I known such service was to be    The nearest way my gratitude might take    To solve the debt, I'd e'en have given back    All that I hold of you: and, now, not e'en    Your crown and kingdom could requite to me    The cutting sense of shame that I endur'd    When on me fell the sad reproachful glance    Which told me how I stood in the esteem    Of yonder lady. Let me tell you, sir,    You've borrow'd for a moment what whole years    Cannot bestow--an honourable name.    Now fare you well; I've sorrow at my heart,    To think your majesty hath reckon'd thus    Upon my nature. I was poor before,    Therefore I can be poor again without    Regret, so I lose not mine own esteem.           *       *       *       *       *    FRANCIS.      Excellent.    Oh, ye are precious wooers, all of ye.    I marvel how ye ever ope your lips    Unto, or look upon that fearful thing,    A lovely woman.    CLEMENT.      And I marvel, sir,    At those who do not feel the majesty,--    By heaven, I'd almost said the holiness,--    That circles round a fair and virtuous woman:    There is a gentle purity that breathes    In such a one, mingled with chaste respect,    And modest pride of her own excellence,--    A shrinking nature, that is so adverse    To aught unseemly, that I could as soon    Forget the sacred love I owe to heav'n,    As dare, with impure thoughts, to taint the air    Inhal'd by such a being: than whom, my liege,    Heaven cannot look on anything more holy,    Or earth be proud of anything more fair. [_Exit_.    Gonzales, the monk, is despatched by the Queen to Bourbon in prison. At  the door he meets Margaret, who had bribed her way to her lover, and was  returning after ineffectual attempts to soothe him into submission,  shame-struck at the exposure of her mother's guilt. The Queen intrusts  Gonzales with a signet ring as the means of liberating him and conducting "]]]
