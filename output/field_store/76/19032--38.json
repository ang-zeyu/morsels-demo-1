[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9791"],[0,"Harrigan (#4)"],[1," you coming up?\"    \"Aye.\"    He ran up the ladder and followed her to a cabin. She rummaged through  a suitcase and finally brought out a little tin box of salve and a roll  of gauze. As she stooped with her back to him, he saw that her hair was  red--not fiery red like his, but a deep dull bronze, with points of  gold where the light struck it. When she straightened and turned, her  eyes went wide, looking up to him, for he bulked huge in the tiny  cabin.    \"What a big fellow you are!\"    He did not answer for a moment; he was too busy watching her eyes,  which were sea-green, and strangely pleasant and restful.    \"Do you know me?\" she asked with a slight frown.    \"'Scuse me,\" muttered Harrigan. \"I thought at first I did.\"    He abased his glance while she took one of his hands and turned it palm  up.    \"Ugh!\" she muttered. \"How did this happen?\"    \"Work.\"    \"Do you mean to say they make you work with your hands in this  condition?\"    \"Sure.\"    \"Poor fellow! That black captain!\"    Her voice had changed from a peculiarly soft, low accent to a shrill  tone that made Harrigan start.    \"Poor fellow!\" she repeated. \"Sit down.\"    The campstool creaked under the burden of his weight. She pulled up the  chair in front of him and placed his left hand on her knees.    \"This is peroxide. Tell me if it hurts too much.\"    She spilled some of the liquid across his palm; it frothed.    \"Ouch!\" grunted Harrigan involuntarily.    She caught his wrists with both hands.    \"Why, your whole arm is trembling! You must be in torture with this.  Have you made any complaint?\"    \"No.\"    She studied him for a moment, scenting a mystery somewhere and guessing  that he would not speak of it. And she asked no questions. She said not  a word and merely bowed her head and started to apply the salve with  delicate touches. For the result, a confession of all his troubles  tumbled up the big man's throat to his tongue. He had to set his teeth  to keep it back.    She became aware of those cold, incurious eyes studying her face as she  wrapped the gauze bandage deftly around the injured palms.    \"Why do you watch me so closely?\"    It disarmed him. Those possibilities of tenderness came about his  stiff-set lips, and the girl wondered.    \"I was thinkin' about my home town.\"    \"Where is it?\"    He frowned and waved his hand in a sweep which included half the points  on the compass.    \"Back there.\"    She waited, wrapping up the gauze bandage.    \"When I was a kid, I used to go down to the harbor an' watch the ships  comin' in an' goin' out,\" he went on cautiously.    She nodded, and he resumed with more confidence: \"I'd sit on the  pierhead an' watch the ships. I knew they was bringing the smell of far  lands in their holds.\"    There was a little pause; then his head tilted back and he burst into  the soft, thick brogue: \"Ah-h, I was afther bein' woild about the  schooners blowin' out to sea wid their sails shook out like clouds. An'  then I'd look down to the wather around the pier, an' it was green,  deep green, ah-h, the deep sea-green av it! An' I would look into it  an' dream. Whin I seen your eyes--\"    He stopped, grown cold as a man will when he feels that he has laid his  inner self indecently bare to the eye of the world. But she did not  stir; she did not smile.    \"I felt like a kid again,\" said Harrigan, recovering from the brogue.  \"Like a kid sittin' on the pierhead an' watchin' the green water. Your  eyes are that green,\" he finished.    Self-consciousness, the very thing which she had been trying to keep  the big sailor from, turned her blood to fire. She knew the quick color  was running from throat to cheek; she knew the cold, incurious eye  would note the change. He was so far aware of the alteration that he  rose and glanced at the door.    \"Good-by,\" she said, and then quite forgetting herself: \"I shall ask  the captain to see that you are treated like a white man.\"    \"You will not!\"    \"I beg your pardon?\" she said, but the hint of insulted dignity was  lost on Harrigan.    \"You will not,\" he repeated. \"It'd simply make him worse.\"    She was glad of the chance to be angry; it would explain her  heightening color.    \"The captain must be an utter brute.\"    \"I figger he's nine tenths man, an' the other tenth devil, but there  ain't no human bein' can change any of them ten parts. Good-by. I'm  thankin' you. My name's Harrigan.\"    She opened the door for him.    \"If you wish to have that dressing changed, ask for Miss Malone.\"    \"Ah-h!\" said Harrigan. \"Malone!\"    She explained coldly: \"I'm Scotch, not Irish.\"    \"Scotch or Irish,\" said Harrigan, and his head tilted back as it always  did when he was excited. \"You're afther bein' a real shport, Miss  Malone!\"    \"Miss Malone,\" she repeated, closing the door after him, and vainly  attempting to imitate the thrill which he gave to the word. \"What a  man!\"    She smiled for a moment into space and then pulled the cord for the  cabin boy.          CHAPTER 5      The cabin boy did duty for all the dozen passengers, and therefore he  was slow in answering. When he appeared, she asked him to carry the  captain word that she wished to speak with him. He returned in a short  time to say that Captain McTee would talk with her now in his cabin.  She followed aft to the captain's room. He did not rise when she  entered, but turned in his chair and relinquished a long, black,  fragrant cigar.    \"Don't stop smoking,\" she said. \"I want you in a pleasant mood to hear  what I have to say.\"    Without reply he placed the cigar in his mouth and the bright black  eyes fastened upon her. That suddenly intent regard was startling, as  if he had leaned over and spoken a word in her ear. She shrugged her  shoulders as if trying to shake off a compelling hand and then settled  into a chair.    \"I've come to say something that's disagreeable for you to hear and for  me to speak.\"    Still he would not talk. He was as silent as Harrigan. She clenched her  hands and drove bravely ahead. She told how she had called the  red-headed sailor up to the after-cabin and dressed his hurts, and she  described succinctly, but with rising anger the raw and swollen  condition of his fingers. The captain listened with apparent enjoyment;  she could not tell whether he was relishing her story or his slowly  puffed cigar. In the end she waited for his answer, but evidently none  was forthcoming.    \"Now,\" she said at last, \"I know something about ships and sailors, and  I know that if this fellow was to appeal against you after you touch  port, a judge would weigh a single word of yours against a whole  sentence of Harrigan's. It would be a different matter if a  disinterested person pressed a charge of cruelty against you. I am such  a person; I would press such a charge; I have the money, the time, and  the inclination to do it.\"    She read the slight hesitation in his manner, not as if he were  impressed by what she had to say, but as though he was questioning  himself as to whether he should give her any answer at all. It made her  wish fervently that she were a man--and a big one. He spoke then, as if  an illuminating thought had occurred to him.    \"You know Harrigan's record?\"    \"No,\" she admitted grudgingly.    McTee sighed as if with deep relief and leaned back in his chair. His  smile was sympathetic and it altered his face so marvelously that she  caught her breath.    \"Of course that explains it, Miss Malone. I don't doubt that he was  clever enough to make you think him abused.\"    \"He didn't say a word of accusation against anyone.\"    \"Naturally not. When a man is bad enough to seem honest--\"    He drew a long, slow puff on his cigar by way of finishing his sentence  and his eyes smiled kindly upon her.    \"I knew that he would do his worst to start mutiny among the crew; I  didn't think he could get as far as the passengers.\"    Her confidence was shaken to the ground. Then a new suspicion came to  her.    \"If he is such a terrible character, why did you let him come aboard  your ship?\"    Instead of answering, he pulled a cord. The bos'n appeared in a moment.    \"Tell this lady how Harrigan came aboard,\" ordered the captain, and he  fastened a keen eye upon the bos'n.    \"Made it on the jump while we was pullin' out of dock,\" said the  sailor. \"Just managed to get his feet on the gangplank--came within an  ace of falling into the sea.\"    \"That's all.\"    The bos'n retreated and McTee turned back to Kate Malone.    \"He had asked me to sign him up for this trip,\" he explained. \"If I'd  set him ashore, he'd probably have been in the police court the next  morning. So I let him stay. To be perfectly frank with you, I had a  vague hope that gratitude might make a decent sailor out of him for a  few days. But the very first night he started his work he began to talk  discontent among the men in the forecastle, and such fellows are always  ready to listen. Of course I could throw Harrigan in irons and feed him  on bread and water; my authority is absolute at sea. But I don't want  to do that if I can help it. Instead, I have been trying to discipline  him with hard work. He knows that he can come to me at any time and  speak three words which will release him from his troubles. But he  won't say them--yet!\"    \"Really?\" she breathed.    She began to feel deeply honored that such a man as McTee would make so  long an explanation to her.    \"Shall I call him up here and ask him to say them now?\"    \"Would you do that? Captain McTee, I'm afraid that I've been very  foolish to bother you in this matter, but--\"    He silenced her with a wave of the hand, and pulled the cord.    \"Bring up Harrigan,\" he said, when the bos'n appeared again.    \"I've considered myself a judge of human nature,\" she apologized, \"but  I shall think a long time before I venture another decision.\"    \"You're wrong to feel that way. It would take a shrewd judge to see  through Harrigan unless his record were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#4)"],[1,". Whatever the reason, while remaining dutiful  to Rome, he devoted himself to the care of his people, to the  maintenance of their full religious and national life, and to the  strengthening of the Holy City against the struggle he foresaw. To the  Jews of the Diaspora, moreover, the succession of Claudius brought a  renewal of privileges. An edict of tolerance was promulgated, first to  the Alexandrians, and afterwards to the communities in all parts of the  habitable globe, by which liberty of conscience and internal autonomy  were restored, with a notable caution against Jewish missionary  enterprise. \"We think it fitting,\" runs the decree, \"to permit the Jews  everywhere under our sway to observe their ancient customs without  hindrance; and we hereby charge them to use our graciousness with  moderation and not to show contempt of the religious observances of  other people, but to keep their own laws quietly.\"[1] Nevertheless the  tolerant principle on which Caesar and Augustus had sought to found the  Empire was surely giving way to a more tyrannical policy, which viewed  with suspicion all bodies that fostered a corporate life separate from  that of the State, whether Jewish synagogue, Stoic school, or religious  college.    [Footnote 1: Ant. XIX, v. 2.]    The conflict between Rome and Jerusalem entered on a bitterer stage when  Agrippa died in 44 C.E. Influenced by his self-seeking band of  freedmen-counselors, who saw in office in Palestine a golden opportunity  for spoliation, Claudius placed the vacant kingdom again under the  direct administration of Roman procurators, and appointed to the office  a string of the basest creatures of the court, who revived the  injustices of the worst days of the Republic.    From 48-52 C.E. Palestine was under the governorship of Ventidius  Cumanus, who seemed deliberately to egg on the Jews to insurrection.  When a Roman soldier outraged the Jewish conscience by indecent conduct  in the Temple during the Passover, Cumanus refused all redress, called  on the soldiers to put down the clamoring people, and slew thousands of  them in the holy precincts.[1] A little later, when an Imperial officer  was attacked on the road and robbed, Cumanus set loose the legionaries  on the villages around, and ordered a general pillage. When a Galilean  Jew was murdered in a Samaritan village, and the Jewish Zealots, failing  to get redress, attacked Samaria, Cumanus fell on them and crucified  whomever he captured. Then, indeed, the Roman governor of Syria, not so  reckless as his subordinate, or, it may be, corrupted by the man anxious  to step into the procurator's place, summoned Cumanus before him, and  sent him to Rome to stand his trial for maladministration.    [Footnote 1: Ant. XX. v. 3.]    But this act of belated justice brought the Jews small comfort; Cumanus  was succeeded by Felix, an even worse creature. He was the brother of  the Emperor's favorite Narcissus, \"by badness raised to that proud  eminence,\" and the husband of the Herodian princess Drusilia, who had  become a pagan in order to marry him. Tacitus, the Roman historian,  says[1] that \"with all manner of cruelty he exercised royal functions in  the spirit of a slave.\" Under his rapacious tyranny the people were  goaded to fury. Bands of assassins, Sicarii (so called by both Romans  and Jews because of the short dagger, sica, which they used), sprang up  over the country. Now they struck down Romans and Romanizers, and now  they were employed by the governor himself to put out of the way rich  Jewish nobles whose possessions he coveted. From time to time there were  more serious risings, some purely political, others led by a  pseudo-Messiah, and all alike put down with cruelty. Roman governors  were habitually corrupt, grasping, and cruel, but Mommsen declares that  those of Judea in the reigns of Claudius and Nero, who were chosen from  the upstart equestrians, exceeded the usual measure of worthlessness and  oppressiveness. The Jews believed that they had drunk to the dregs the  cup of misery, and that God must send them a Redeemer. There were no  prophets to preach as at the time of the struggle with Babylon and  Assyria, that the oppression was God's chastisement for their sins. And  it was inconceivable to them that the power of wickedness should be  allowed to triumph to the end.    [Footnote 1: Hist. v. 9.]    Steadily the party that clamored for war gained in strength, and the  apprehensions of the Pharisees who viewed the political struggle with  misgiving, lest it should end in the loss of the national center and the  destruction of religious independence, were overborne by the fury of the  masses. The oppression by Roman governors and Romanizing high priests  did not diminish when Nero succeeded Claudius. For the rest of the  Empire the first five years of his reign (the _quinquennium Neronis_)  were a period of peace and good government, but for the Jews they  brought little or no relief. The harsh Roman policy toward the Jews may  have been specially instigated by Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, who was  Nero's counselor during his saner years, and who entertained a strong  hatred of Judaism. But we need not look for such special causes. It had  been the fixed habit of Republican Rome to crush out the national spirit  of a subject people, \"to war down the proud,\" as her greatest poet  euphemistically expressed it; and now that spirit was adopted by the  Imperial Caesars in dealing with the one and only people resolved to  preserve inviolate its national life and its national religion. Nero  indeed recalled Felix, and Festus, who was appointed in his place, made  an attempt to mend affairs, but he died within a year, and was succeeded  by two procurators that were worthy followers of Felix. The first of  them was Albinus (62-64), of whom Josephus says that there was no sort  of wickedness in which he had not a hand. The same authority says that  compared with Gessius Florus, the governor under whom the Rebellion  burst out, he was \"most just.\" Florus owed his appointment to Poppaea,  the profligate wife of Nero, and his conduct bears the interpretation  that he was deliberately anxious to fill the measure of persecution to  the brim and drive the nation to war.    The very forms of privilege which had been left to the Jews were turned  to their hurt. The Herodian tetrarchs of Chalcis, to whom the Romans  granted the power of appointing the high priests, true to the tradition  of their house, appointed only such as were confirmed Romanizers, and  the most unscrupulous at that. When Felix was governor, the high priest  was the notorious Ananias, of whom the Talmud says, \"Woe to the House of  Ananias; woe for their cursings, woe for their serpent-like  hissings.\"[1] Herod Agrippa II, the son of Agrippa, who held the  principate from 50-100 C.E., and was the faithful creature of Rome  throughout the period of his people's stress, proclaiming himself on his  coins \"lover of Caesar and lover of Rome,\" deposed and created high  priests with unparalleled frequency as a means of extorting money and  rewarding the leading informers. There were seven holders of the office  during the last twenty years of Roman rule, and \"he who carried furthest  servility and national abnegation received the prize.\" The high priests  thus formed a kind of anti-national oligarchy; they robbed the other  priests of their dues, and reduced them to poverty, and were the willing  tools of Roman tyranny. Together with the Herodian princes, who indulged  every lust and wicked passion, they undermined the strength of the  people like some fatal canker, much as the priests and nobles had done  at the first fall of Jerusalem, or, again, in the days of the Seleucid  Emperors. Apart from governors, tax-collectors, and high priests, the  Romans had an instrument of oppression in the Greek-speaking population  of Palestine and Syria, which maintained an inveterate hostility to the  Jews. The immediate cause of the great Rebellion actually arose out of a  feud between the Jewish and the Gentile inhabitants of Caesarea. The  Hellenistic population outnumbered the Jews in the Herodian foundations  of Caesarea, Sepphoris, Tiberias, Paneas, etc., as well as in the old  Greek cities of Doris, Scythopolis, Gerasa, Gadara, and the rest of the  Decapolis. This population regarded religion only as the pretext for  public ceremonials and entertainments; it was scornful of the Jewish  abstention from these things, and was aroused to the bitterest hatred by  the social aloofness of their neighbors. Violent riots between Jew and  Gentile were constantly taking place, and whether they were the  aggressors or merely fighting in self-defense, the Jews were the  scapegoats for the breaking of the peace. Stung by constant outrage on  the part of their neighbors, the Jews turned upon them at Caesarea, and  drove them out of the town. Thereupon Florus called them to reckoning,  marched on Jerusalem, and plundered the Temple treasury. This event  happened on the tenth day of Iyar in the year 66 C.E. The war-party  determined to force the struggle to a final issue. Hitherto they had  only been able to arouse a section to venture desperate sporadic  insurrection against the might of Rome. Now they carried the people with  them to engage in a national rebellion.    [Footnote 1: Pesahim, 57a.]    Agrippa II, who was amusing himself at Alexandria when the first  outbreak occurred, hurried back to Jerusalem, and sought to quiet the  people by impressing upon them the invincible power of Rome. But he  failed, and the Romanizing priests' party failed, and the peaceful  leaders of the Pharisees failed, to shake their determination. Messianic  hopes were rife among the masses, and were invested with a materialistic  interpretation. The Zealots, it is alleged by the pagan as well as the  Jewish authorities for the period, believed that the destined time was  come when"]]]
