His cousins helped in the latter part of this work. Weakness had  reduced Uncle Bill to speechlessness. Finally the head of Bill  Campbell was laid on a double fold of blanket in lieu of a pillow. A  pipe had been tamped full and lighted by Bull and--crowning  insult--set between Bill's teeth. When all this was accomplished Bull  retired to his corner, picked up his book, and was instantly absorbed.    In the hushed atmosphere it seemed that a terrible blow had fallen,  and that another was about to fall. Harry and Joe were as men stunned,  but they looked upon their father with a gathering complacency. They  had found it demonstrated that it was possible to disobey their father  without being instantly destroyed. They were taking the lesson to  heart. And indeed old Bill Campbell himself seemed to be slowly  admitting that he was beaten.    The illusion of absolute self-sufficiency, which he had built up  through the years for the sake of imposing upon his sons and Bull  Hunter, was now destroyed. At a single stroke he had been exposed as  an old man, already beaten in battle by a foeman and now requiring as  much care as a sick woman. The shame of it burned in him; but the  comfort of the smoothed bunk and the filled pipe between his teeth was  a blessing. He found to his own surprise that he was not hating Bull  with a tithe of his usual vigor. He began to realize that he had come  to the end of his period of command. When he left that sickbed he  could only advise.    As a king about to die he looked at his heirs and found them strong  and sufficient and pleasing to the eye. Nowhere in the mountains were  there two boys as tall, as straight, as deadly with rifle and  revolver, as fierce, as relentless, as these two boys of his. He had  sharpened their tempers, and he rejoiced in the sullen ferocity with  which they looked at him now, unloving, cunning, biding their time and  finding that it had almost come. But he was not yet done. His body was  wrecked; there remained his mind, and they would find it a great  power. But he did not talk until the lights had been put out and the  three youths were in their separate bunks. Then, without the light to  show them his helpless body, in the darkness, which would give his  mind a freer play, he began to tell his story.    It was a long narrative. Far back in the years he had prospected with  a youth named Pete Reeve. They had located a claim and they had gone  to town together to celebrate. In the celebration he had drunk with  Reeve till the boy stupefied. Then he had induced Reeve to gamble for  his share of the claim and had won it. Afterward Pete swore to be even  with him. But the years had gone by without another meeting of  the men.    Only today, riding through the mountains, he had come on a dried-up  wisp of a man with long, iron-gray hair, a sharp, withered face, and  hands like the claws of a bird. He rode a fine bay gelding, and had  stopped Bill to ask some questions about the region above the  timberline because he was drifting south and intended to cross the  summits. Bill had described the way, and suddenly, out of their talk,  came the revelation of their identities--the one was Bill Campbell,  the other was Pete Reeve.    At this point in the story Bull heaved himself slowly, softly up on  one arm to listen. He was beginning to get the full sense of the words  for the first time. This narrative was like a book done in a  commoner language.          CHAPTER 4      The tale halted. To be defeated is one thing; to be forced to confess  defeat is another. Uncle Bill determined on the bitterer alternative.    \"He made a clean fight,\" declared Uncle Bill. \"First he cussed me out  proper. Then he went for his gat and he beat me to the draw. They  ain't no disgrace to that. You'll learn pretty soon that anybody might  get beaten sooner or later--if he fights enough men. And my gun hung  in the leather. Before I got it on him he'd shot me clean through the  right shoulder--a placed shot, boys. He wanted to land me there. It  tumbled me off my hoss. I rolled away and tried to get to my gun that  had fallen on the ground. He shot me ag'in through the leg and  stopped me.    \"Then he got off his hoss and fixed up the wounds. He done a good job,  as you seen. 'Bill' says he, 'you ain't dead; you're worse'n dead.  That right arm of yours is going to be stiff the rest of your days.  You're a one-armed man from now on, and that one arm is the worst  you got.'    \"That was why he sent me home alive. To make me live and keep hating  him, the same's he'd lived and hated me. But he made a mistake. Pete  Reeve is a wise fox, but he made one mistake. He forgot that I might  have somebody to send on his trail. He didn't know that I had two boys  I'd raised so's they was each better with a gun nor me. He didn't  dream of that, curse him! But when you, Harry, or you, Joe, pump the  lead into him, shoot him so's he'll live long enough to know who  killed him and why!\"    As he spoke, there was a quality in his voice that seemed to find the  boys in the darkness and point each of them out. \"Which of you takes  the trail?\"    A little silence followed. Bull wondered at it.    \"He's gone by way of Johnstown,\" continued the wounded man. \"If one of  you cuts across the summit toward Shantung he's pretty sure to cut in  across Pete's trail. Which is goin' to start? Well, you can match for  the chance! Because him that comes back with Pete Reeve marked off the  slate is a man!\"    That chilly little silence made Bull's heart beat. To be called a man,  to be praised by stern Bill Campbell--surely these were things to make  anyone risk death!    \"Is that the Pete Reeve,\" said Harry's voice, \"that shot up Mike  Rivers over the hill to the Tompkins place, about four year back?\"    \"That's him. Why?\"    Again the silence. Then Bull heard the old man cursing  softly--meditatively, one might almost have said.    \"Cut across for Johnstown,\" said Joe softly, \"in a storm like this?  They won't be no trails left to find above the timberline. It'd be  sure death. Listen!\"    There was a lull in the wind, and in the breeze that was left, they  could hear the whisper of the snow crushing steadily against  the window.    \"It's heavy fall, right enough,\" declared Harry.    \"And this Pete Reeve--why, he's a gunfighter, Dad.\"    \"And what are you?\" asked the old man. \"Ain't I labored and slaved all  my life to make you handy with guns? What for d'you think I wasted all  them hours showin' you how to pull a trigger and where to shoot and  how to get a gun out of the leather?\"    \"To kill for meat,\" suggested Harry.    \"Meat, nothing! The kind of meat I mean walks on two feet and fights  back.\"    \"Maybe, if we started together--\" ventured Joe.    His father broke in, \"Boy, I ain't going to send out a pack of men to  run down Pete Reeve. He met me single and he fought me clean, and he's  going to be pulled down by no pack of yaller dogs! Go one of you alone  or else both of you stay here.\"    He waited, but there was no response. \"Is this the way my blood is  showin' up in my sons? Is this the result of all my trainin'?\"    After that there was no more talk. The long silence was not broken by  even the sound of breathing until someone began to snore. Then Bull  knew that the sleep of the night had settled down.    He lay with his hands folded behind his head, thinking. They were  willing enough to go together to do this difficult thing. But had they  not lifted together at the stump and failed to do the thing which he  had done single-handed? That thought stuck in his memory and would not  out. And suppose he, Bull, were to accomplish this great feat and  return to the shack? Would not Bill Campbell feel doubly repaid for  the living he had furnished for his nephew? More than once the grim  old man had cursed the luck that saddled him with a stupid incubus.  But the curses would turn to compliments if Bull left this little man,  this catlike and dangerous fighter, this Pete Reeve, dead on  the trail.    Not that all this was clear in the mind of Bull, but he felt something  like a command pushing him on that difficult south trail, through the  storm and the snow that would now be piling above the timberline. He  waited until there was no noise but the snoring of the sleepers and  the rush and roar of the wind which continually set something stirring  in the room. These sounds served to cover effectually any noises he  made as he felt about and made up his small pack. His old canvas coat,  his most treasured article of apparel, he took down from the hook  where it accumulated dust from month to month. His ancient, secondhand  cartridge belt with the antiquated revolver he removed from another  hook--he had never been given enough ammunition to become a shot of  any quality--and he pushed quickly into the night.    The moment he was through the door, the storm caught him in the face a  stinging blow, and the rush of snow chilled his skin. That stinging  blow steadied to a blast. It was a tremendous, heavy fall. The wind  had scoured the drifts from the clearing and was already banking them  around the little house. In the morning, as like as not, the boys  would have to dig their way out.    He went straight to the horse shed for his snowshoes that hung on the  wall there. Ordinary snowshoes would not endure his ponderous weight,  and Uncle Bill Campbell had fashioned these himself, heavy and  uncomfortable articles, but capable of enduring the strain.    Fumbling his way down behind the stalls, Bill's roan lashed out at him  with savage heels; but Maggie, the old draft horse, whinnied softly,  greeting that familiar heavy step. He tied the snowshoes on his back  and then stopped for a last word to Maggie. She raised her head and  dropped it clumsily on his shoulder. She was among the little, agile  mountain ponies what "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10338"],[0,"With the Turks in Palestine (#5)"],[1,"Jewish young men or simply because I  had been standing conveniently in the doorway. The officer closed the  door and came straight to the point by asking me where our store of  arms was hidden. He was a big fellow, with the handsome, cruel features  usual enough in his class. There was no open menace in his first  question. When I refused to tell him, he began wheedling and offering  all sorts of favors if I would betray my people. Then, all of a sudden,  he whipped out a revolver and stuck the muzzle right in my face. I felt  the blood leave my heart, but I was able to control myself and refuse  his demand. The officer was not easily discouraged; the hours I passed  in that little room, with its smoky kerosene lamp, were terrible ones. I  realized, however, how tremendously important the question of the arms  was, and strength was given me to hold out until the officer gave up in  disgust and let me go home.    [ILLUSTRATION: HOUSE OF THE AUTHOR'S FATHER, EPHRAIM FISHL AARONSOHN, IN  ZICRON-JACOB]    My father, an old man, knew nothing of what had happened, but the rest  of my family were tremendously excited. I made light of the whole  affair, but I felt sure that this was only the beginning. Sure enough,  next morning--the Sabbath--the same officer returned and put three of  the leading elders of the village, together with myself, under arrest.  After another fruitless inquisition at the hotel, we were handcuffed and  started on foot toward the prison, a day's journey away. As our little  procession passed my home, my father, who was aged and feeble, came  tottering forward to say good-bye to me. A soldier pushed him roughly  back; he reeled, then fell full-length in the street before my eyes.    It was a dismal departure. We were driven through the streets shackled  like criminals, and the women and children came out of the houses and  watched us in silence--their heads bowed, tears running down their  cheeks. They realized that for thirty-five years these old men, my  comrades, had been struggling and suffering for their ideal--a  regenerated Palestine; now, in the dusk of their life, it seemed as if  all their hopes and dreams were coming to ruin. The oppressive tragedy  of the situation settled down on me more and more heavily as the day  wore on and heat and fatigue told on my companions. My feelings must  have been written large on my face, for one of them, a fine-looking  patriarch, tried to give me comfort by reminding me that we must not  rely upon strength of arms, and that our spirit could never be broken,  no matter how defenseless we were. Thus he, an old man, was encouraging  me instead of receiving help from my youth and enthusiasm.    At last we arrived at the prison and were locked into separate cells.  That same night we were tortured with the _falagy_, or bastinado. The  victim of this horrible punishment is trussed up, arms and legs, and  thrown on his knees; then, on the bare soles of his feet a pliant green  rod is brought down with all the force of a soldier's arm. The pain is  exquisite; blood leaps out at the first cut, and strong men usually  faint after thirty or forty strokes. Strange to say, the worst part of  it is not the blow itself, but the whistling of the rod through the air  as it rushes to its mark. The groans of my older comrades, whose gasps  and prayers I could hear through the walls of the cell, helped me bear  the agony until unconsciousness mercifully came to the rescue.    For several days more we were kept in the prison, sick and broken with  suffering. The second night, as I lay sleepless and desperate on the  strip of dirty matting that served as bed, I heard a scratch-scratching  at the grated slit of a window, and presently a slender stick was  inserted into the cell. I went over and shook it; some one at the other  end was holding it firm. And then, a curious whispering sound began to  come from the end of the stick. I put my ear down, and caught the voice  of one of the men from our village. He had taken a long bamboo pole,  pierced the joints, and crept up behind a broken old wall close beneath  my window. By means of this primitive telephone we talked as long as we  dared. I assured him that we were still enduring, and urged him on no  account to give up the arms to the Turkish authorities--not even if we  had to make the ultimate sacrifice.    Finally, when it was found that torture and imprisonment would not make  us yield our secret, the Turks resorted to the final test--the ordeal  which we could not withstand. They announced that on a certain date a  number of our young girls would be carried off and handed over to the  officers, to be kept until the arms were disclosed. We knew that they  were capable of carrying out this threat; we knew exactly what it meant.  There was no alternative. The people of our village had nothing to do  but dig up the treasured arms and, with broken hearts, hand them over to  the authorities.    And so the terrible news was brought to us one morning that we were  free. Personally, I felt much happier on the day I was put in prison  than when I was released. I had often wondered how our people had been  able to bear the rack and thumbscrew of the Spanish Inquisition; but  when my turn and my comrades' came for torture, I realized that the same  spirit that helped our ancestors was working in us also.    Now I knew that our suffering had been useless. Whenever the Turkish  authorities wished, the horrors of the Armenian massacres would live  again in Zicron-Jacob, and we should be powerless to raise a hand to  protect ourselves. As we came limping home through the streets of our  village, I caught sight of my own Smith & Wesson revolver in the hands  of a mere boy of fifteen--the son of a well-known Arab outlaw. I  realized then that the Turks had not only taken our weapons, but had  distributed them among the natives in order to complete our humiliation.  The blood rushed to my face. I started forward to take the revolver away  from the boy, but one of the old men caught hold of my sleeve and held  me back.    [ILLUSTRATION: IN A NATIVE CAFE, SAFFED/A LEMONADE-SELLER OF DAMASCUS]          CHAPTER VI    THE SUEZ CAMPAIGN      I have already spoken of the so-called \"requisitioning\" that took place  among our people while I was working at Saffed. This, of course, really  amounted to wholesale pillage. The hand of the Turkish looters had  fallen particularly heavy on carts and draught animals. As the Arabs  know little or nothing of carting, hauling, or the management of horses  and mules, the Turks, simply enough, had \"requisitioned\" many of the  owners--middle-aged or elderly men--and forced them to go south to help  along with the tremendous preparations that were being made for the  attack on Suez. Among these were a number of men from our village. In  the course of time their families began to get the most harrowing  messages from them. They were absolutely destitute, no wages being paid  them by the Turks; their clothes were dropping off them in rags; many  were sick. After much excited planning, it was decided to send another  man and myself down south on a sort of relief expedition, with a  substantial sum of money that had been raised with great difficulty by  our people. Through the influence of my brother at the Agricultural  Experiment Station, I got permission from the _mouchtar_ to leave  Zicron-Jacob, and about the middle of January, 1915, I set out for  Jerusalem.    To Western minds, the idea of the Holy City serving as a base for modern  military operations must be full of incongruities. And, as a matter of  fact, it _was_ an amazing sight to see the streets packed with  khaki-clad soldiers and hear the brooding silence of ancient walls  shattered by the crash of steel-shod army boots. Here, for the first  time, I saw the German officers--quantities of them. Strangely out of  place they looked, with their pink-and-whiteness that no amount of hot  sunshine could quite burn off. They wore the regular German officer's  uniform, except that the _Pickelhaube_ was replaced by a khaki  sun-helmet. I was struck by the youthfulness of them; many were nothing  but boys, and there were weak, dissolute faces in plenty--a fact that  was later explained when I heard that Palestine had been the  dumping-ground for young men of high family whose parents were anxious  to have them as far removed as possible from the danger zone. Fast's  Hotel was the great meeting-place in Jerusalem for these young bloods.  Every evening thirty or forty would foregather there to drink and talk  women and strategy. I well remember the evening when one of them--a  slender young Prussian with no back to his head, braceleted and  monocled--rose and announced, in the decisive tones that go with a  certain stage of intoxication: \"What we ought to do is to hand over the  organization of this campaign to Thomas Cook & Sons!\"    However, the German officers were by no means all incompetents. They  realized (I soon found out) that they had little hope of bringing a big  army through the Egyptian desert and making a successful campaign there.  Their object was to immobilize a great force of British troops around  the Canal, to keep the Mohammedan population in Palestine impressed with  Turkish power, and to stir up religious unrest among the natives in  Egypt. It must be admitted that in the first two of these purposes they  have been successful.    The Turks were less far-sighted. They believed firmly that they were  going to sweep the English off the face of the earth and enter Cairo in  triumph, and preparations for the march on Suez went on with feverish  enthusiasm. The ideas of the common soldiers on this subject were  amusing. Some of them declared that the Canal was to be filled up by the  sandbags which had been prepared in great quantities. Others held that  thousands of camels would be kept without water for many days preceding  the"]]]
