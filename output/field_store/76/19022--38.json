[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#4)"],[1,"of my train to Strelsau and of  the fast-waning afternoon. To remember a train in such a spot would  have been rank sacrilege. Instead of that, I fell to dreaming that I  was married to the Princess Flavia and dwelt in the Castle of Zenda, and  beguiled whole days with my love in the glades of the forest--which made  a very pleasant dream. In fact, I was just impressing a fervent kiss on  the charming lips of the princess, when I heard (and the voice seemed at  first a part of the dream) someone exclaim, in rough strident tones.    \"Why, the devil's in it! Shave him, and he'd be the King!\"    The idea seemed whimsical enough for a dream: by the sacrifice of my  heavy moustache and carefully pointed imperial, I was to be transformed  into a monarch! I was about to kiss the princess again, when I arrived  (very reluctantly) at the conclusion that I was awake.    I opened my eyes, and found two men regarding me with much curiosity.  Both wore shooting costumes and carried guns. One was rather short  and very stoutly built, with a big bullet-shaped head, a bristly grey  moustache, and small pale-blue eyes, a trifle bloodshot. The other was a  slender young fellow, of middle height, dark in complexion, and bearing  himself with grace and distinction. I set the one down as an old  soldier: the other for a gentleman accustomed to move in good society,  but not unused to military life either. It turned out afterwards that my  guess was a good one.    The elder man approached me, beckoning the younger to follow. He did so,  courteously raising his hat. I rose slowly to my feet.    \"He's the height, too!\" I heard the elder murmur, as he surveyed my six  feet two inches of stature. Then, with a cavalier touch of the cap, he  addressed me:    \"May I ask your name?\"    \"As you have taken the first step in the acquaintance, gentlemen,\" said  I, with a smile, \"suppose you give me a lead in the matter of names.\"    The young man stepped forward with a pleasant smile.    \"This,\" said he, \"is Colonel Sapt, and I am called Fritz von Tarlenheim:  we are both in the service of the King of Ruritania.\"    I bowed and, baring my head, answered:    \"I am Rudolf Rassendyll. I am a traveller from England; and once for a  year or two I held a commission from her Majesty the Queen.\"    \"Then we are all brethren of the sword,\" answered Tarlenheim, holding  out his hand, which I took readily.    \"Rassendyll, Rassendyll!\" muttered Colonel Sapt; then a gleam of  intelligence flitted across his face.    \"By Heaven!\" he cried, \"you're of the Burlesdons?\"    \"My brother is now Lord Burlesdon,\" said I.    \"Thy head betrayeth thee,\" he chuckled, pointing to my uncovered poll.  \"Why, Fritz, you know the story?\"    The young man glanced apologetically at me. He felt a delicacy which  my sister-in-law would have admired. To put him at his ease, I remarked  with a smile:    \"Ah! the story is known here as well as among us, it seems.\"    \"Known!\" cried Sapt. \"If you stay here, the deuce a man in all Ruritania  will doubt of it--or a woman either.\"    I began to feel uncomfortable. Had I realized what a very plainly  written pedigree I carried about with me, I should have thought long  before I visited Ruritania. However, I was in for it now.    At this moment a ringing voice sounded from the wood behind us:    \"Fritz, Fritz! where are you, man?\"    Tarlenheim started, and said hastily:    \"It's the King!\"    Old Sapt chuckled again.    Then a young man jumped out from behind the trunk of a tree and stood  beside us. As I looked at him, I uttered an astonished cry; and he,  seeing me, drew back in sudden wonder. Saving the hair on my face and  a manner of conscious dignity which his position gave him, saving also  that he lacked perhaps half an inch--nay, less than that, but still  something--of my height, the King of Ruritania might have been Rudolf  Rassendyll, and I, Rudolf, the King.    For an instant we stood motionless, looking at one another. Then I bared  my head again and bowed respectfully. The King found his voice, and  asked in bewilderment:    \"Colonel--Fritz--who is this gentleman?\"    I was about to answer, when Colonel Sapt stepped between the King and  me, and began to talk to his Majesty in a low growl. The King towered  over Sapt, and, as he listened, his eyes now and again sought mine.  I looked at him long and carefully. The likeness was certainly  astonishing, though I saw the points of difference also. The King's face  was slightly more fleshy than mine, the oval of its contour the least  trifle more pronounced, and, as I fancied, his mouth lacking something  of the firmness (or obstinacy) which was to be gathered from  my close-shutting lips. But, for all that, and above all minor  distinctions, the likeness rose striking, salient, wonderful.    Sapt ceased speaking, and the King still frowned. Then, gradually, the  corners of his mouth began to twitch, his nose came down (as mine  does when I laugh), his eyes twinkled, and, behold! he burst into the  merriest fit of irrepressible laughter, which rang through the woods and  proclaimed him a jovial soul.    \"Well met, cousin!\" he cried, stepping up to me, clapping me on the  back, and laughing still. \"You must forgive me if I was taken aback. A  man doesn't expect to see double at this time of day, eh, Fritz?\"    \"I must pray pardon, sire, for my presumption,\" said I. \"I trust it will  not forfeit your Majesty's favour.\"    \"By Heaven! you'll always enjoy the King's countenance,\" he laughed,  \"whether I like it or not; and, sir, I shall very gladly add to it what  services I can. Where are you travelling to?\"    \"To Strelsau, sire--to the coronation.\"    The King looked at his friends: he still smiled, though his expression  hinted some uneasiness. But the humorous side of the matter caught him  again.    \"Fritz, Fritz!\" he cried, \"a thousand crowns for a sight of brother  Michael's face when he sees a pair of us!\" and the merry laugh rang out  again.    \"Seriously,\" observed Fritz von Tarlenheim, \"I question Mr. Rassendyll's  wisdom in visiting Strelsau just now.\"    The King lit a cigarette.    \"Well, Sapt?\" said he, questioningly.    \"He mustn't go,\" growled the old fellow.    \"Come, colonel, you mean that I should be in Mr. Rassendyll's debt,  if--\"    \"Oh, ay! wrap it up in the right way,\" said Sapt, hauling a great pipe  out of his pocket.    \"Enough, sire,\" said I. \"I'll leave Ruritania today.\"    \"No, by thunder, you shan't--and that's sans phrase, as Sapt likes it.  For you shall dine with me tonight, happen what will afterwards. Come,  man, you don't meet a new relation every day!\"    \"We dine sparingly tonight,\" said Fritz von Tarlenheim.    \"Not we--with our new cousin for a guest!\" cried the King; and, as Fritz  shrugged his shoulders, he added: \"Oh! I'll remember our early start,  Fritz.\"    \"So will I--tomorrow morning,\" said old Sapt, pulling at his pipe.    \"O wise old Sapt!\" cried the King. \"Come, Mr. Rassendyll--by the way,  what name did they give you?\"    \"Your Majesty's,\" I answered, bowing.    \"Well, that shows they weren't ashamed of us,\" he laughed. \"Come, then,  cousin Rudolf; I've got no house of my own here, but my dear brother  Michael lends us a place of his, and we'll make shift to entertain you  there;\" and he put his arm through mine and, signing to the others to  accompany us, walked me off, westerly, through the forest.    We walked for more than half an hour, and the King smoked cigarettes  and chattered incessantly. He was full of interest in my family, laughed  heartily when I told him of the portraits with Elphberg hair in our  galleries, and yet more heartily when he heard that my expedition to  Ruritania was a secret one.    \"You have to visit your disreputable cousin on the sly, have you?\" said  he.    Suddenly emerging from the wood, we came on a small and rude  hunting-lodge. It was a one-storey building, a sort of bungalow, built  entirely of wood. As we approached it, a little man in a plain livery  came out to meet us. The only other person I saw about the place was  a fat elderly woman, whom I afterwards discovered to be the mother of  Johann, the duke's keeper.    \"Well, is dinner ready, Josef?\" asked the King.    The little servant informed us that it was, and we soon sat down to a  plentiful meal. The fare was plain enough: the King ate heartily, Fritz  von Tarlenheim delicately, old Sapt voraciously. I played a good  knife and fork, as my custom is; the King noticed my performance with  approval.    \"We're all good trenchermen, we Elphbergs,\" said he. \"But what?--we're  eating dry! Wine, Josef! wine, man! Are we beasts, to eat without  drinking? Are we cattle, Josef?\"    At this reproof Josef hastened to load the table with bottles.    \"Remember tomorrow!\" said Fritz.    \"Ay--tomorrow!\" said old Sapt.    The King drained a bumper to his \"Cousin Rudolf,\" as he was gracious--or  merry--enough to call me; and I drank its fellow to the \"Elphberg Red,\"  whereat he laughed loudly.    Now, be the meat what it might, the wine we drank was beyond all price  or praise, and we did it justice. Fritz ventured once to stay the King's  hand.    \"What?\" cried the King. \"Remember you start before I do, Master  Fritz--you must be more sparing by two hours than I.\"    Fritz saw that I did not understand.    \"The colonel and I,\" he explained, \"leave here at six: we ride down to  Zenda and return with the guard of honour to fetch the King at eight,  and then we all ride together to the station.\"    \"Hang that same guard!\" growled Sapt.    \"Oh! it's very civil of my brother to ask the honour for his regiment,\"  said the King. \"Come, cousin, you need not start early. Another bottle,  man!\"    I had another bottle--or, rather, a part of one, for the larger half  travelled quickly down his Majesty's throat. Fritz gave up his attempts  at persuasion: from persuading, he fell to being persuaded, and soon we  were all of us as full of wine as we had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/950"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout; Or, The Speediest Car on the Road (#4)"],[1,"Andy's car now,  and, as they heard him approach, the three cronies turned around.    \"He's going to race you, after all, Andy!\" cried Sam.    \"You mean he's going to try,\" sneered Andy. \"I'll give him all the  racing he wants!\"    In another few seconds Tom was beside the auto, and would have passed  it, only Andy opened his throttle a little more. For a moment the auto  jumped ahead, and then, as our hero turned on still more power, he  easily held his own.    \"Aw, you can never beat us!\" yelled Pete.    \"Of course not!\" added Sam.    \"I'll leave him behind in a second,\" prophesied Andy. \"Wait until I  throw in the other gear,\" he added to his cronies in a low voice. \"He  thinks he's going to beat me. I'll let him think so, and then I'll  spurt ahead.\"    The two machines were now racing along side by side. Andy's car was  going the limit on third gear, but he still had the fourth gear in  reserve. Tom, too, still had a little margin of speed.    Suddenly Andy reached forward and yanked on a lever. There was a  grinding of cogs as the fourth gear slipped into place, for Andy did  not handle his car skillfully. The effect, however, was at once  apparent. The automobile shot forward.    \"Now where are you, Tom Swift?\" cried Sam.    Tom said nothing. He merely shifted a lever, and got a better spark. He  also turned on a little more gasolene and opened the muffler. The  quickness with which his motor-cycle shot forward almost threw him from  the saddle, but he had a tight grip on the handle bars. He whizzed past  the auto, but, as the latter gathered speed, it crept up to him, and,  once more was on even terms. Much chagrined at seeing Tom hold pace  with him, even for an instant, Andy shouted:    \"Get over on your own side there! You're crowding me!\"    \"I am not!\" yelled back Tom, above the explosions of his machine.    The two were now racing furiously, and Andy, with a savage look, tried  to get more speed out of his car. In spite of all the bully did, Tom  was gradually forging ahead. A little hill was now in view.    \"Here's where I make him take my dust!\" cried Andy, but, to his  surprise Tom still kept ahead. The auto began to lose ground, for it  was not made to take hills on high gear.    \"Change to third gear quick!\" cried Sam.    Andy tried to do it. There was a hesitancy on the part of his car. It  seemed to balk. Tom, looking back, slowed up a trifle. He could afford  to, as Andy was being beaten.    \"Go on! Go on!\" begged Pete. \"You'll have to keep on fourth gear to  beat him, Andy.\"    \"That's what!\" murmured the bully. Once more he shifted the gears.  There was a grinding, smashing sound, and the car lost speed. Then it  slowed up still more, and finally stopped. Then it began to back down  hill.    \"I've stripped those blamed gears!\" exclaimed Andy ruefully.    \"Can't you beat him?\" asked Pete.    \"I could have, easily, if my gears hadn't broken,\" declared the bully,  but, as a matter of fact, he could not have done so. \"I oughtn't to  have changed, going up hill,\" he added, as he jammed on the brakes, to  stop the car from sliding down the slope.    Tom saw and heard.    \"I thought you were so anxious to race,\" he said, exultantly, as well  he might. \"I don't want to try a contest down hill, though, Andy,\" and  he laughed at the red-haired lad, who was furious.    \"Aw, go on!\" was all the retort the squint-eyed one could think of to  make.    \"I am going on,\" replied our hero. \"Just to show you that I can go down  hill, watch me.\"    He turned his motor-cycle, and approached Andy's stalled car, for Tom  was some distance in advance of it, up the slope by this time. As he  approached the auto, containing the three disconcerted cronies,  something bounded out of Tom's pocket. It was the bottle of stove  blacking he had purchased for Mrs. Baggert. The bottle fell in the soft  dirt in front of his forward wheel, and a curious thing happened.  Perhaps you have seen a bicycle or auto tire strike a stone at an  angle, and throw it into the air with great force. That was what  happened to the bottle. Tom's front wheel struck the cork, which fitted  tightly, and, just as when you hit one end of the wooden \"catty\" and it  bounds up, the bottle described a curve through the air, and flew  straight toward Andy's car. It struck the brass frame of the wind  shield with a crash.    The bottle broke, and in an instant the black liquid was spattered all  over Andy, Sam and Pete. It could not have been done more effectively  if Tom had thrown it by hand. All over their clothes, their hands and  faces, and the front of the car went the dreary black. Tom looked on,  hardly able to believe what he saw.    \"Wow! Wup! Ug! Blug! Mug!\" spluttered Sam, who had some of the stuff in  his mouth.    \"Oh! Oh!\" yelled Pete.    \"You did that on purpose, Tom Swift!\" shouted Andy, wiping some of the  blacking from his left eye. \"I'll have you arrested for that! You've  ruined my car, and look at my suit!\"    \"Mine's worse!\" murmured Sam, glancing down at his light trousers,  which were of the polka-dot pattern now.    \"No, mine is,\" insisted Pete, whose white shirt was of the hue of a  stove pipe.    Andy wiped some of the black stuff from his nose, whence it was  dropping on the steering wheel.    \"You just wait!\" the bully called to Tom. \"I'll get even with you for  this!\"    \"It was an accident! I didn't mean to do that,\" explained Tom, trying  not to laugh, as he dismounted from his motor-cycle, ready to render  what assistance he could.          CHAPTER IV    TALK OF A NEW BANK      The three cronies were in a sorrowful plight. The black fluid dripped  from them, and formed little puddles in the car. Andy had used his  handkerchief to wipe some of the stuff from his face, but the linen was  soon useless, for it quickly absorbed the blacking.    \"There's a little brook over here,\" volunteered Tom. \"You might wash in  that. The stuff comes off easily. It isn't like ink,\" and he had to  laugh, as he thought of the happening.    \"Here! You quit that!\" ordered Andy. \"You've gone too far, Tom Swift!\"    \"Didn't I tell you it was an accident?\" inquired the young inventor.    \"It wasn't!\" cried Sam. \"You threw the bottle at us! I saw you!\"    \"It slipped from my pocket,\" declared the youth, and he described how  the accident occurred. \"I'll help you clean your car, Andy,\" he added.    \"I don't want your help! If you come near me I'll--I'll punch your  nose!\" cried Andy, now almost beside himself with rage.    \"All right, if you don't want my help I don't care,\" answered Tom, glad  enough not to have to soil his hands and clothes. He felt that it was  partly his fault, and he would have done all he could to remedy  matters, but his good offers being declined, he felt that it was  useless to insist further.    He remounted his motor-cycle, and rode off, the last view he had of the  trio being one where they were at the edge of the brook, trying to  remove the worst traces of the black fluid. As Tom turned around for a  final glimpse, Andy shook his fist at him, and called out something.    \"I guess Andy'll have it in for me,\" mused Tom. \"Well, I can't help it.  I owed him something on account, but I didn't figure on paying it in  just this way,\" and he thought of the time the bully had locked him in  the ballast tanks of the submarine, thereby nearly smothering him to  death.    That night Andy Foger told his father what had happened, for Mr. Foger  inquired the reason for the black stains on his son's face and hands.  But Andy did not give the true version. He said Tom had purposely  thrown the bottle of blacking at him.    \"So that's the kind of a lad Tom Swift is, eh?\" remarked Andy's father.  \"Well, Andy, I think you will soon have a chance to get even with him.\"    \"How, pop?\"    \"I can't tell you now, but I have a plan for making Tom sorry he ever  did anything to you, and I will also pay back some old scores to Mr.  Swift and Mr. Damon. I'll ruin their bank for them, that's what I'll  do.\"    \"Ruin their bank, pop? How?\"    \"You wait and see. The Swift crowd will get off their high horse soon,  or I'm mistaken. My plans are nearly completed, but I can't tell you  about them. I'll ruin Mr. Swift, though, that's what I'll do,\" and Mr.  Foger shook his head determinedly.    Tom was soon at his home, and Mrs. Baggert, hearing the noise of his  machine, as it entered the front yard, came to the side door.    \"Where's my blacking?\" she asked, as our hero dismounted and untied the  bundle of steel tubes he had purchased.    \"I--I used it,\" he answered, laughing.    \"Tom Swift! You don't mean to say you took my stove polish to use in  your battery, do you?\"    \"No, I used it to polish off Andy Foger and some of his cronies,\" and  the young inventor told, with much gusto, what had happened. Mrs.  Baggert could not help joining in the laugh, and when Tom offered to  ride back and purchase some more of the polish for her, she said it did  not matter, as she could wait until the next day.    The lad was soon busy in his machine shop, making several larger cells  for the new storage battery. He wanted to give it a more severe test.  He worked for several days on this, and when he had one unit of cells  complete, he attached the motor for an efficiency trial.    \"We'll see how many miles that will make,\" he remarked to his father.    \"Have you thought anything of the type of car you are going to build?\"  asked the aged inventor of his son.    \"Yes, somewhat. It will be almost of the regulation style, but with two  removable seats at the rear, with curtains for protection, and a place  in front for two persons. This can also be protected with curtains when  desired.\"    \"But what about the motors and the battery?\"    \"They will be located under the middle of the car. There will be one  set of batteries there, together with the motor, and another set of  batteries will be placed under the removable seats in what I call the  tonneau,"]]]
