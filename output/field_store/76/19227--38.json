Moreover such beings were not strictly angels.    The doctrine of monotheism was formally expressed in the period  immediately before and during the Exile, in Deuteronomy[16] and  Isaiah;[17] and at the same time we find angels prominent in Ezekiel  who, as a prophet of the Exile, may have been influenced by the  hierarchy of supernatural beings in the Babylonian religion, and  perhaps even by the angelology of Zoroastrianism.[18] Ezekiel gives  elaborate descriptions of cherubim;[19] and in one of his visions he  sees seven angels execute the judgment of God upon Jerusalem.[20] As  in Genesis they are styled \"men,\" _mal'akh_ for \"angel\" does not occur  in Ezekiel. Somewhat later, in the visions of Zechariah, angels play  a great part; they are sometimes spoken of as \"men,\" sometimes as  _mal'akh_, and the _Mal'akh Yahweh_ seems to hold a certain primacy  among them.[21] Satan also appears to prosecute (so to speak) the  High Priest before the divine tribunal.[22] Similarly in Job the _bne  Elohim_, sons of God, appear as attendants of God, and amongst them  Satan, still in his role of public prosecutor, the defendant being  Job.[23] Occasional references to \"angels\" occur in the Psalter;[24]  they appear as ministers of God.    In Ps. lxxviii. 49 the \"evil angels\" of A.V. conveys a false  impression; it should be \"angels of evil,\" as R.V., _i.e._ angels who  inflict chastisement as ministers of God.    The seven angels of Ezekiel may be compared with the seven eyes of  Yahweh in Zech. iii. 9, iv. 10. The latter have been connected by  Ewald and others with the later doctrine of seven chief angels,[25]  parallel to and influenced by the Ameshaspentas (Amesha Spenta), or  seven great spirits of the Persian mythology, but the connexion is  doubtful.    In the Priestly Code, _c._ 400 B.C., there is no reference to angels  apart from the possible suggestion in the ambiguous plural in Genesis  i. 26.    During the Persian and Greek periods the doctrine of angels underwent  a great development, partly, at any rate, under foreign influences.  In Daniel, _c._ 160 B.C., angels, usually spoken of as \"men\" or  \"princes,\" appear as guardians or champions of the nations; grades are  implied, there are \"princes\" and \"chief\" or \"great princes\"; and  the names of some angels are known, Gabriel, Michael; the latter is  pre-eminent,[26] he is the guardian of Judah. Again in Tobit a leading  part is played by Raphael, \"one of the seven holy angels.\"[27]    In Tobit, too, we find the idea of the demon or evil angel. In the  canonical Old Testament angels may inflict suffering as ministers  of God, and Satan may act as accuser or tempter; but they appear as  subordinate to God, fulfilling His will; and not as morally evil. The  statement[28] that God \"charged His angels with folly\" applies to  all angels. In Daniel the princes or guardian angels of the heathen  nations oppose Michael the guardian angel of Judah. But in Tobit we  find Asmodaeus the evil demon, [Greek: to poneros daimonion], who  strangles Sarah's husbands, and also a general reference to \"a devil  or evil spirit,\" [Greek: pneuma].[29] The Fall of the Angels is not  properly a scriptural doctrine, though it is based on Gen. vi. 2, as  interpreted by the Book of Enoch. It is true that the _bn[=e] Elohim_  of that chapter are subordinate superhuman beings (cf. above), but  they belong to a different order of thought from the angels of Judaism  and of Christian doctrine; and the passage in no way suggests that the  _bne Elohim_ suffered any loss of status through their act.    The guardian angels of the nations in Daniel probably represent the  gods of the heathen, and we have there the first step of the process  by which these gods became evil angels, an idea expanded by Milton  in _Paradise Lost_. The development of the doctrine of an organized  hierarchy of angels belongs to the Jewish literature of the period 200  B.C. to A.D. 100. In Jewish apocalypses especially, the imagination  ran riot on the rank, classes and names of angels; and such works as  the various books of Enoch and the _Ascension of Isaiah_ supply much  information on this subject.    [v.02 p.0006]    In the New Testament angels appear frequently as the ministers of God  and the agents of revelation;[30] and Our Lord speaks of angels  as fulfilling such functions,[31] implying in one saying that they  neither marry nor are given in marriage.[32] Naturally angels are most  prominent in the Apocalypse. The New Testament takes little interest  in the idea of the angelic hierarchy, but there are traces of the  doctrine. The distinction of good and bad angels is recognized; we  have names, Gabriel,[33] and the evil angels Abaddon or Apollyon,[34]  Beelzebub.[35] and Satan;[36] ranks are implied, archangels,[37]  principalities and powers,[38] thrones and dominions.[39] Angels  occur in groups of four or seven.[40] In Rev. i.-iii. we meet with  the \"Angels\" of the Seven Churches of Asia Minor. These are probably  guardian angels, standing to the churches in the same relation that  the \"princes\" in Daniel stand to the nations; practically the \"angels\"  are personifications of the churches. A less likely view is that the  \"angels\" are the human representatives of the churches, the bishops or  chief presbyters. There seems, however, no parallel to such a use  of \"angel,\" and it is doubtful whether the monarchical government of  churches was fully developed when the Apocalypse was written.    Later Jewish and Christian speculation followed on the lines of the  angelology of the earlier apocalypses; and angels play an important  part in Gnostic systems and in the Jewish Midrashim and the Kabbala.  Religious thought about the angels during the middle ages was much  influenced by the theory of the angelic hierarchy set forth in the  _De Hierarchia Celesti_, written in the 5th century in the name  of Dionysius the Areopagite and passing for his. The creeds and  confessions do not formulate any authoritative doctrine of angels; and  modern rationalism has tended to deny the existence of such beings,  or to regard the subject as one on which we can have no certain  knowledge. The principle of continuity, however, seems to require the  existence of beings intermediate between man and God.    The Old Testament says nothing about the origin of angels; but the  _Book of Jubilees_ and the Slavonic _Enoch_ describe their creation;  and, according to Col. i. 16, the angels were created in, unto and  through Christ.    Nor does the Bible give any formal account of the nature of angels.  It is doubtful how far Ezekiel's account of the cherubim and Isaiah's  account of the seraphim are to be taken as descriptions of actual  beings; they are probably figurative, or else subjective visions.  Angels are constantly spoken of as \"men,\" and, including even the  Angel of Yahweh, are spoken of as discharging the various functions  of human life; they eat and drink,[41] walk[42] and speak.[43] Putting  aside the cherubim and seraphim, they are not spoken of as having  wings. On the other hand they appear and vanish,[44] exercise  miraculous powers,[45] and fly.[46] Seeing that the anthropomorphic  language used of the angels is similar to that used of God, the  Scriptures would hardly seem to require a literal interpretation in  either case. A special association is found, both in the Bible and  elsewhere, between the angels and the heavenly bodies,[47] and the  elements or elemental forces, fire, water, &c.[48] The angels are  infinitely numerous.[49]    The _function_ of the angels is that of the supernatural servants of  God. His agents and representatives; the Angel of Yahweh, as we have  seen, is a manifestation of God. In old times, the _bne Elohim_ and  the seraphim are His court, and the angels are alike the court and the  army of God; the cherubim are his throne-bearers. In his dealings with  men, the angels, as their name implies, are specially His messengers,  declaring His will and executing His commissions. Through them he  controls nature and man. They are the guardian angels of the nations;  and we also find the idea that individuals have guardian angels.[50].  Later Jewish tradition held that the Law was given by angels.[51]  According to the Gnostic Basilides, the world was created by angels.  Mahommedanism has taken over and further elaborated the Jewish and  Christian ideas as to angels.    While the scriptural statements imply a belief in the existence of  spiritual beings intermediate between God and men, it is probable that  many of the details may be regarded merely as symbolic imagery. In  Scripture the function of the angel overshadows his personality; the  stress is on their ministry; they appear in order to perform specific  acts.

After a  short conversation pertaining to everyday occurrences, the subject of  superstition was broached to Mrs. Avery. The idea amused her and she  gave the writer the following facts: As far as possible the stories are  given in her exact words. The interview required two days, November 30  and December 2, 1936.    \"When you see a dog lay on his stomach and slide it is a true sign of  death. This is sho true cause it happened to me. Years ago when I lived  on Pine Street I was sitting on my steps playing with my nine-months old  baby. A friend uv mine came by and sat down; and as we set there a dog  that followed her began to slide on his stomach. It scared me; and I  said to her, did you see that dog? Yes, I sho did. That night my baby  died and it wuzn't sick at all that day. That's the truth and a sho sign  of death. Anudder sign of death is ter dream of a new-born baby. One  night not so long ago I dreamt about a new-born baby and you know I went  ter the door and called Miss Mary next door and told her I dreamed about  a new-born baby, and she said, Oh! that's a sho sign of death. The same  week that gal's baby over there died. It didn't surprise me when I heard  it cause I knowed somebody round here wuz go die.\" She continued:    \"Listen, child! If ebber you clean your bed, don't you never sweep off  your springs with a broom. Always wipe 'em with a rag, or use a brush.  Jest as sho as you do you see or experience death around you. I took my  bed down and swept off my springs, and I jest happened to tell old Mrs.  Smith; and she jumped up and said, 'Child, you ought not done that  cause it's a sign of death.' Sho nuff the same night I lost another  child that wuz eight years old. The child had heart trouble, I think.\"    Mrs. Avery believes in luck to a certain extent. The following are  examples of how you may obtain luck:    \"I believe you can change your luck by throwing a teaspoonful of sulphur  in the fire at zackly 12 o'clock in the day. I know last week I was  sitting here without a bit of fire, but I wuzn't thinking bout doing  that till a 'oman came by and told me ter scrape up a stick fire and put  a spoonful of sulphur on it; and sho nuff in a hour's time a coal man  came by and gave me a tub uv coal. Long time ago I used ter work fer  some white women and every day at 12 o'clock I wuz told ter put a  teaspoonful of sulphur in the fire.\"    \"Another thing, I sho ain't going ter let a 'oman come in my house on  Monday morning unless a man done come in there fust. No, surree, if it  seem lak one ain't coming soon, I'll call one of the boy chilluns, jest  so it is a male. The reason fer this is cause women is bad luck.\"    The following are a few of the luck charms as described by Mrs. Avery:    \"Black cat bone is taken from a cat. First, the cat is killed and  boiled, after which the meat is scraped from the bones. The bones are  then taken to the creek and thrown in. The bone that goes up stream is  the lucky bone and is the one that should be kept.\" \"There is a boy in  this neighborhood that sells liquor and I know they done locked him up  ten or twelve times but he always git out. They say he carries a black  cat bone,\" related Mrs. Avery.    \"The Devil's shoe string looks jest like a fern with a lot of roots. My  mother used to grow them in the corner of our garden. They are lucky.    \"Majres (?) are always carried tied in the corner of a handkerchief. I  don't know how they make 'em.    \"I bought a lucky stick from a man onct. It looked jest lak a candle,  only it wuz small; but he did have some sticks as large as candles and  he called them lucky sticks, too, but you had to burn them all night in  your room. He also had some that looked jest lak buttons, small and  round.\"    The following are two stories of conjure told by Mrs. Avery:    \"I knowed a man onct long ago and he stayed sick all der time. He had  the headache from morning till night. One day he went to a old man that  wuz called a conjurer; this old man told him that somebody had stole the  sweat-band out of his cap and less he got it back, something terrible  would happen. They say this man had been going with a 'oman and she had  stole his sweat-band. Well, he never did get it, so he died.    \"I had a cousin named Alec Heard, and he had a wife named Anna Heard.  Anna stayed sick all der time almost; fer two years she complained. One  day a old conjurer came to der house and told Alec that Anna wuz  poisoned, but if he would give him $5.00 he would come back Sunday  morning and find the conjure. Alec wuz wise, so he bored a hole in the  kitchen floor so that he could jest peep through there to der back  steps. Sho nuff Sunday morning the nigger come back and as Alec watched  him he dug down in the gound a piece, then he took a ground puppy, threw  it in the hole and covered it up. All right, he started digging again  and all at onct he jumped up and cried: 'Here 'tis! I got it.' 'Got  what?' Alec said, running to the door with a piece of board. 'I got the  ground puppy dat wuz buried fer her.' Alec wuz so mad he jumped on that  man and beat him most to death. They say he did that all the time and  kept a lot of ground puppies fer that purpose.\" Continuing, she  explained that a ground puppy was a worm with two small horns. They are  dug up out of the ground, and there is a belief that you will die if one  barks at you.    Mrs. Avery related two ways in which you can keep from being conjured by  anyone.    \"One thing I do every morning is ter sprinkle chamber-lye [HW: (urine)]  with salt and then throw it all around my door. They sho can't fix you  if you do this. Anudder thing, if you wear a silver dime around your  leg they can't fix you. The 'oman live next door says she done wore two  silver dimes around her leg for 18 years.\"    Next is a story of the Jack O'Lantern.    \"Onct when I wuz a little girl a lot of us chillun used to slip off and  take walnuts from a old man. We picked a rainy night so nobody would see  us, but do you know it looked like a thousand Jack ma' Lanterns got in  behind us. They wuz all around us. I never will ferget my brother  telling me ter get out in the path and turn my pocket wrong side out. I  told him I didn't have no pocket but the one in my apron; he said,  'well, turn that one wrong side out.' Sho nuff we did and they scattered  then.\"    Closing the interview, Mrs. Avery remarked: \"That's bout all I know; but  come back some time and maybe I'll think of something else.\"          MRS. EMMALINE HEARD    [TR: This interview, which was attached to the interview with Mrs.  Celestia Avery, is also included in the second volume of the Georgia  Narratives.]      On December 3 and 4, 1936, Mrs. Emmaline Heard was interviewed at her  home, 239 Cain Street. The writer had visited Mrs. Heard previously, and  it was at her own request that another visit was made. This visit was  supposed to be one to obtain information and stories on the practice of  conjure. On two previous occasions Mrs. Heard's stories had proved very  interesting, and I knew as I sat there waiting for her to begin that she  had something very good to tell me. She began:    \"Chile, this story wuz told ter me by my father and I know he sho  wouldn't lie. Every word of it is the trufe; fact, everything I ebber  told you wuz the trufe. Now, my pa had a brother, old Uncle Martin, and  his wife wuz name Julianne. Aunt Julianne used ter have spells and fight  and kick all the time. They had doctor after doctor but none did her any  good. Somebody told Uncle Martin to go ter a old conjurer and let the  doctors go cause they wan't doing nothing fer her anyway. Sho nuff he  got one ter come see her and give her some medicine. This old man said  she had bugs in her head, and after giving her the medicine he started  rubbing her head. While he rubbed her head he said: 'Dar's a bug in her  head; it looks jest like a big black roach. Now, he's coming out of her  head through her ear; whatever you do, don't let him get away cause I  want him. Whatever you do, catch him; he's going ter run, but when he  hits the pillow, grab 'em. I'm go take him and turn it back on the one  who is trying ter send you ter the grave.' Sho nuff that bug drap out  her ear and flew; she hollered, and old Uncle Martin ran in the room,  snatched the bed clothes off but they never did find him. Aunt Julianne  never did get better and soon she died. The conjurer said if they had a  caught the bug she would a lived.\"    The next story is a true story. The facts as told by Mrs. Heard were  also witnessed by her; as it deals with the conjuring of one of her  sons. It is related in her exact words as nearly as possible.    \"I got a son named Albert Heard. He is living and well; but chile, there  wuz a time when he wuz almost ter his grave. I wuz living in town then,  and Albert and his wife wuz living in the country with their two  chillun. Well, Albert got down sick and he would go ter doctors, and go  ter doctors, but they didn't do him any good. I wuz worried ter death  cause I had ter run backards and for'ards and it wuz a strain on me. He  wuz suffering with a knot on his right side and he couldn't even fasten  his shoes cause it pained him so, and it wuz so bad he couldn't even  button up his pants. A 'oman teached school out there by the name of  Mrs. Yancy; she's dead now but she lived right here on Randolph Street  years ago. Well, one day when I wuz leaving Albert's house I met her on  the way from her school. 'Good evening, Mrs. Heard,' she says. 'How is  Mr. Albert?' I don't hardly know, I says, cause he don't get no better.  She looked at me kinda funny and said, don't you believe he's hurt?' Yes  mam, I said, I sho do. 'Well,' says she, 'I been wanting to say  something to you concerning this but I didn't know how you would take  it. If I tell you somewhere ter go"]]]
