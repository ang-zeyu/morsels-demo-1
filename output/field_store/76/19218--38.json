Burbank, that wonderful moulder of plant life, has well expressed this  thought, when he says: \"All my investigations have led me away from the  idea of a dead material universe tossed about by various forces, to  that of a universe which is absolutely all force, life, soul, thought,  or whatever name we may choose to call it. Every atom, molecule, plant,  animal or planet, is only an aggregation of organized unit forces, held  in place by stronger forces, thus holding them for a time latent,  though teeming with inconceivable power. All life on our planet is, so  to speak, just on the outer fringe of this infinite ocean of force. The  universe is not half dead, but all alive.\"    Science today is gazing upon a living universe. She has not yet  realized the full significance of what she has discovered, and her  hands are raised as if to shade her eyes from the unaccustomed glare  that is bursting upon her. From the dark cavern of universal dead  matter, she has stepped out into the glare of the noon-day sun of a  Universe All-Alive even to its smallest and apparently most inert  particle.    Beginning at Man, the highest form of Life known to us, we may pass  rapidly down the scale of animal life, seeing life in full operation at  each descending step. Passing from the animal to the vegetable kingdom,  we still see Life in full operation, although in lessened degrees of  expression. We shall not stop here to review the many manifestations of  Life among the forms of plant-life, for we shall have occasion to  mention them in our next lesson, but it must be apparent to all that  Life is constantly manifesting in the sprouting of seeds; the putting  forth of stalk, leaves, blossoms, fruit, etc., and in the enormous  manifestation of force and energy in such growth and development. One  may see the life force in the plant pressing forth for expression and  manifestation, from the first sprouting of the seed, until the last  vital action on the part of the mature plant or tree.    Besides the vital action observable in the growth and development of  plants, we know, of course, that plants sicken and die, and manifest  all other attributes of living forms. There is no room for argument  about the presence of life in the plant kingdom.    But there are other forms of life far below the scale of the plants.  There is the world of the bacteria, microbes, infusoria--the groups of  cells with a common life--the single cell creatures, down to the  Monera, the creatures lower than the single cells--the Things of the  slime of the ocean bed.    These tiny Things--living Things--present to the sight merely a tiny  speck of jelly, without organs of any kind. And yet they exercise all  the functions of life--movement, nutrition, reproduction, sensation,  and dissolution. Some of these elementary forms are all stomach, that  is they are all one organ capable of performing all the functions  necessary for the life of the animal. The creature has no mouth, but  when it wishes to devour an object it simply envelopes it--wraps itself  around it like a bit of glue around a gnat, and then absorbs the  substance of its prey through its whole body.    Scientists have turned some of these tiny creatures inside out, and yet  they have gone on with their life functions undisturbed and untroubled.  They have cut them up into still tinier bits, and yet each bit lived on  as a separate animal, performing all of its functions undisturbed. They  are all the same all over, and all the way through. They reproduce  themselves by growing to a certain size, and then separating into two,  and so on. The rapidity of the increase is most remarkable.    Haekel says of the Monera: \"The Monera are the simplest permanent  cytods. Their entire body consists of merely soft, structureless plasm.  However thoroughly we may examine them with the help of the most  delicate reagents and the strongest optical instruments, we yet find  that all the parts are completely homogeneous. These Monera are  therefore, in the strictest sense of the word, 'organisms without  organs,' or even in a strict philosophical sense they might not even be  called organisms, since they possess no organs and since they are not  composed of various particles. They can only be called organisms in so  far as they are capable of exercising the organic phenomena of life, of  nutrition, reproduction, sensation and movement.\"    Verworn records an interesting instance of life and mind among the  _Rhizopods_, a very low form of living thing. He relates that the  _Difflugia ampula_, a creature occupying a tiny shell formed of minute  particles of sand, has a long projection of its substance, like a  feeler or tendril, with which it searches on the bottom of the sea for  sandy material with which to build the shell or outer covering for its  offspring, which are born by division from the parent body. It grasps  the particle of sand by the feeler, and passes it into its body by  enclosing it. Verworn removed the sand from the bottom of the tank,  replacing it by very minute particles of highly colored glass. Shortly  afterward he noticed a collection of these particles of glass in the  body of the creature, and a little later he saw a tiny speck of  protoplasm emitted from the parent by separation. At the same time he  noticed that the bits of glass collected by the mother creature were  passed out and placed around the body of the new creature, and cemented  together by a substance secreted by the body of the parent, thus  forming a shell and covering for the offspring. This proceeding showed  the presence of a mental something sufficient to cause the creature to  prepare a shell for the offspring previous to its birth--or rather to  gather the material for such shell, to be afterward used; to  distinguish the proper material; to mould it into shape, and cement it.  The scientist reported that a creature always gathered just exactly  enough sand for its purpose--never too little, and never an excess. And  this in a creature that is little more than a tiny drop of glue!    We may consider the life actions of the Moneron a little further, for  it is the lowest form of so-called \"living matter\"--the point at which  living forms pass off into non-living forms (so-called). This tiny  speck of glue--an organism without organs--is endowed with the faculty  called sensation. It draws away from that which is likely to injure it,  and toward that which it desires--all in response to an elementary  sensation. It has the instinct of self-preservation and  self-protection. It seeks and finds its prey, and then eats, digests  and assimilates it. It is able to move about by \"false-feet,\" or bits  of its body which it pushes forth at will from any part of its  substance. It reproduces itself, as we have seen, by separation and  self-division.    The life of the bacteria and germs--the yeasty forms of life--are  familiar to many of us. And yet there are forms of life still below  these. The line between living forms and non-living forms is being set  back further and further by science. Living creatures are now known  that resemble the non-living so closely that the line cannot be  definitely drawn.    Living creatures are known that are capable of being dried and laid  away for several years, and then may be revived by the application of  moisture. They resemble dust, but are full of life and function.  Certain forms of bacilli are known to Science that have been subjected  to degrees of heat and cold that are but terms to any but the  scientific mind.    Low forms of life called Diatoms or \"living crystals\" are known. They  are tiny geometrical forms. They are composed of a tiny drop of plasm,  resembling glue, covered by a thin shell of siliceous or sandy  material. They are visible only through the microscope, and are so  small that thousands of them might be gathered together on the head of  a pin. They are so like chemical crystals that it requires a shrewd and  careful observer to distinguish them. And yet they are alive, and  perform all the functions of life.    Leaving these creatures, we enter the kingdom of the crystals, in our  search for life. Yes, the crystals manifest life, as strange as this  statement may appear to those who have not followed the march of  Science. The crystals are born, grow, live, and may be killed by  chemicals or electricity. Science has added a new department called  \"Plasmology,\" the purpose of which is the study of crystal life. Some  investigators have progressed so far as to claim that they have  discovered signs of rudimentary sex functioning among crystals. At any  rate, crystals are born and grow like living things. As a recent  scientific writer has said: \"Crystallization, as we are to learn now,  is not a mere mechanical grouping of dead atoms. It is a birth.\"    The crystal forms from the mother liquor, and its body is built up  systematically, regularly, and according to a well defined plan or  pattern, just as are the body and bones of the animal form, and the  wood and bark of the tree. There is life at work in the growth of the  crystal. And not only does the crystal grow, but it also reproduces  itself by separation or splitting-off, just as is the case with the  lower forms of life, just mentioned.    The principal point of difference between the growth and development of  the crystals and that of the lower forms of life referred to is that  the crystal takes its nourishment from the outside, and builds up from  its outer surface, while the Monera absorbs its nourishment from  within, and grows outwardly from within. If the crystal had a soft  center, and took its nourishment in that way, it would be almost  identical with the Diatom, or, if the Diatom grew from the outside, it  would be but a crystal. A very fine dividing line.    Crystals, like living forms, may be sterilized and rendered incapable  of reproduction by chemical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13439"],[0,"Divine Songs (#5)"],[1,"a young beginner  Practice little pilfering ways,  Till grown up a harden'd sinner,  Then the gallows ends his days.    Theft will not be always hidden,  Though we fancy none can spy:  When we take a thing forbidden,  God beholds it with his eye.    Guard my heart, O God of heaven,  Lest I covet what's not mine;  Lest I steal what is not given,  Guard my heart and hands from sin.      Song 5.  The ant, or emmet.  11,11,8,11,11,8    These Emmets, how little they are in our eyes!  We tread them to dust, and a troop of them dies,  Without our regard or concern:  Yet, as wise as we are, if we went to their school,  There's many a sluggard and many a fool  Some lessons of wisdom might learn.    They wear not their time out in sleeping or play,  But gather up corn in a sunshiny day,  And for winter they lay up their stores:  They manage their work in such regular forms,  One would think they foresaw all the frosts and the storms,  And so brought their food withindoors.    But I have less sense than a poor creeping Ant,  If I take not due care for the things I shall want,  Nor provide against dangers in time;  When death or old age shall once stare in my face,  What a wretch shall I be in the end of my days,  If I trifle away all their prime!    Now, now, while my strength and my youth are in bloom,  Let me think what shall serve me when sickness shall come,  And pray that my sins be forgiven.  Let me read in good books, and believe, and obey;  That, when death turns me out of this cottage of clay,  I may dwell in a palace in heaven.      Song 6.  Good resolutions.  7,8,7,8    Though I'm now in younger days,  Nor can tell what shall befall me,  I'll prepare for every place  Where my growing age shall call me.    Should I e'er be rich or great,  Others shall partake my goodness:  I'll supply the poor with meat,  Never showing scorn or rudeness.    Where I see the blind or lame,  Deaf or dumb, I'll kindly treat them:  I deserve to feel the same,  If I mock, or hurt, or cheat them.    If I meet with railing tongues,  Why should I return them railing,  Since I best revenge my wrongs  By my patience never failing?    When I hear them telling lies,  Talking foolish, cursing, swearing,  First I'll try to make them wise,  Or I'll soon go out of hearing.    What though I be low or mean,  I'll engage the rich to love me,  While I'm modest, neat, and clean,  And submit when they reprove me.    If I should be poor and sick,  I shall meet, I hope, with pity;  Since I love to help the weak,  Though they're neither fair nor witty.    I'll not willingly offend,  Nor be easily offended:  What's amiss I'll strive to mend,  And endure what can't be mended.    May I be so watchful still  O'er my humours and my passion,  As to speak and do no ill,  Though it should be all the fashion.    Wicked fashions lead to hell;  Ne'er may I be found complying;  But in life behave so well,  Not to be afraid of dying.      Song 7.  Summer's evening.  11,11,11,9    How fine has the day been! how bright was the sun!  How lovely and joyful the course that he run;  Though he rose in a mist when his race he begun,  And there followed some droppings of rain:  But now the fair traveller's come to the west,  His rays are all gold, and his beauties are best;  He paints the skies gay as he sinks to his rest,  And foretells a bright rising again.    Just such is the Christian. His course he begins  Like the sun in a mist, while he mourns for his sins,  And melts into tears! then he breaks out and shines,  And travels his heavenly way:  But when he comes nearer to finish his race,  Like a fine setting sun, he looks richer in grace;  And gives a sure hope, at the end of his days,  Of rising in brighter array.      Song 8.  Cradle hymn.  8,7,8,7    Hush, my dear! Lie still, and slumber!  Holy angels guard thy bed!  Heavenly blessings, without number,  Gently falling on thy head.    Sleep, my babe! thy food and raiment,  House and home, thy friends provide;  All without thy care or payment,  All thy wants are well supplied.    How much better thou'rt attended  Than the Son of God could be,  When from heaven he descended,  And became a child like thee!    Soft and easy is thy cradle:  Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay,  When his birthplace was a stable,  And his softest bed was hay.    Blessed Babe! what glorious features,--  Spotless fair, divinely bright!  Must he dwell with brutal creatures?  How could angels bear the sight?    Was there nothing but a manger  Cursed sinners could afford,  To receive the heavenly stranger?  Did they thus affront the Lord?    Soft, my child! I did not chide thee,  Though my song might sound too hard:  'Tis thy mother sits beside thee,  And her arm shall be thy guard.    Yet to read the shameful story.  How the Jews received their King,  How they served the Lord of Glory,  Makes me angry while I sing.    See the kinder shepherds round him,  Telling wonders from the sky!  Where hey sought him, there they found him,  With his Virgin-mother by.    See the lovely Babe a-dressing:  Lovely infant, how he smiled!  When he wept, his mother's blessing  Sooth'd and hush'd the holy Child.    Lo, he slumbers in a manger,  Where the horned oxen fed!--  Peace, my darling, here's no danger:  There's no ox a-near thy bed.    'Twas so save thee, child, from dying,  Save my dear from burning flame,  Bitter groans and endless crying,  That thy blest Redeemer came.    May'st thou live to know and fear him,  Trust and love him all thy days,  Then go dwell for ever near him:  See his face, and sing his praise!    I could give thee thousand kisses!  Hoping what I most desire,  Not a mother's fondest wishes  Can to greater joys aspire!"]]]
