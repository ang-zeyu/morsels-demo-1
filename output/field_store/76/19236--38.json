THE OWL AND"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13656"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga (#5)"],[1,"  when the Candidate has awakened to a realization of his independence of  the body, and material coverings, he often confounds the \"I\" with the  lower principles of the mind. This is a mistake. The Mind, in its various  phases and planes, is but a tool and instrument of the \"I,\" and is far  from being the \"I\" itself. We shall try to bring out this fact in this  lesson and its accompanying exercises. We shall avoid, and pass by, the  metaphysical features of the case, and shall confine ourselves to the  Yogi Psychology. We shall not touch upon theories, nor attempt to  explain the cause, nature and purpose of the Mind--the working tool of  the Ego--but instead shall attempt to point out a way whereby you may  analyze the Mind and then determine which is the \"not I\" and which is the  real \"I.\" It is useless to burden you with theories or metaphysical talk,  when the way to prove the thing is right within your own grasp. By using  the mind, you will be able to separate it into its parts, and force it to  give you its own answer to the questions touching itself.    In the second and third lessons of our \"_Fourteen Lessons_,\" we pointed  out to you the fact that man had three Mental Principles, or subdivisions  of mind, all of which were below the plane of Spirit. The \"I\" is Spirit,  but its mental principles are of a lower order. Without wishing to unduly  repeat ourselves, we think it better to run hastily over these three  Principles in the mind of Man.    First, there is what is known as the Instinctive Mind, which man shares  in common with the lower animals. It is the first principle of mind that  appears in the scale of evolution. In its lowest phases, consciousness  is but barely perceptible, and mere sensation is apparent. In its higher  stages it almost reaches the plane of Reason or Intellect, in fact, they  overlap each other, or, rather, blend into each other. The Instinctive  Mind does valuable work in the direction of maintaining animal life in  our bodies, it having charge of this part of our being. It attends to the  constant work of repair; replacement; change; digestion; assimilation;  elimination, etc., all of which work is performed below the plane of  consciousness.    But this is but a small part of the work of the Instinctive Mind. For  this part of the mind has stored up all the experiences of ourselves and  ancestors in our evolution from the lower forms of animal life into the  present stage of evolution. All of the old animal instincts (which were  all right in their place, and quite necessary for the well-being of the  lower forms of life) have left traces in this part of the mind, which  traces are apt to come to the front under pressure of unusual  circumstances, even long after we think we have outgrown them. In this  part of the mind are to be found traces of the old fighting instinct of  the animal; all the animal passions; all the hate, envy, jealousy, and  the rest of it, which are our inheritances from the past. The Instinctive  Mind is also the \"habit mind\" in which is stored up all the little, and  great, habits of many lives, or rather such as have not been entirely  effaced by subsequent habits of a stronger nature. The Instinctive Mind  is a queer storehouse, containing quite a variety of objects, many of  them very good in their way, but others of which are the worst kind of  old junk and rubbish.    This part of the mind also is the seat of the appetites; passions;  desires; instincts; sensations; feelings and emotions of the lower order,  manifested in the lower animals; primitive man; the barbarian; and the  man of today, the difference being only in the degree of control over  them that has been gained by the higher parts of the mind. There are  higher desires, aspirations, etc., belonging to a higher part of the  mind, which we will describe in a few minutes, but the \"animal nature\"  belongs to the Instinctive Mind. To it also belong the \"feelings\"  belonging to our emotional and passional nature. All animal desires, such  as hunger and thirst; sexual desires (on the physical plane); all  passions, such as physical love; hatred; envy; malice; jealousy; revenge,  etc., are part of this part of the mind. The desire for the physical  (unless a means of reaching higher things) and the longing for the  material, belong to this region of the mind. The \"lust of the flesh; the  lust of the eyes; the pride of life,\" belong to the Instinctive Mind.    Take note, however, that we are not condemning the things belonging to  this plane of the mind. All of them have their place--many were necessary  in the past, and many are still necessary for the continuance of physical  life. All are right in their place, and to those in the particular plane  of development to which they belong, and are wrong only when one is  mastered by them, or when he returns to pick up an unworthy thing that  has been cast off in the unfoldment of the individual. This lesson has  nothing to do with the right and wrong of these things (we have treated  of that elsewhere) and we mention this part of the mind that you may  understand that you have such a thing in your mental make-up, and that  you may understand the thought, etc., coming from it, when we start in to  analyze the mind in the latter part of this lesson. All we will ask you  to do at this stage of the lesson is to realize that this part of the  mind, while _belonging_ to you, is _not_ You, yourself. It is _not_ the  \"I\" part of you.    Next in order, above the Instinctive Mind, is what we have called the  Intellect, that part of the mind that does our reasoning, analyzing;  \"thinking,\" etc. You are using it in the consideration of this lesson.  But note this: You are _using_ it, but it is _not_ You, any more than was  the Instinctive Mind that you considered a moment ago. You will begin to  make the separation, if you will think but a moment. We will not take up  your time with a consideration of Intellect or Reason. You will find a  good description of this part of the mind in any good elementary work on  Psychology. Our only idea in mentioning it is that you may make the  classification, and that we may afterward show you that the Intellect is  but a tool of the Ego, instead of being the real \"I\" itself, as so many  seem to imagine.    The third, and highest, Mental Principle is what is called the Spiritual  Mind, that part of the mind which is almost unknown to many of the race,  but which has developed into consciousness with nearly all who read this  lesson, for the fact that the subject of this lesson attracts you is a  proof that this part of your mental nature is unfolding into  consciousness. This region of the mind is the source of that which we  call \"genius,\" \"inspiration,\" \"spirituality,\" and all that we consider  the \"highest\" in our mental make-up. All the great thoughts and ideas  float into the field of consciousness from this part of the mind. All the  great unfoldment of the race comes from there. All the higher mental  ideas that have come to Man in his upward evolutionary journey, that tend  in the direction of nobility; true religious feeling; kindness; humanity;  justice; unselfish love; mercy; sympathy, etc., have come to him through  his slowly unfolding Spiritual Mind. His love of God and of his fellow  man have come in this way. His knowledge of the great occult truths reach  him through this channel. The mental realization of the \"I,\" which we are  endeavoring to teach in these lessons, must come to him by way of the  Spiritual Mind unfolding its ideas into his field of consciousness.    But even this great and wonderful part of the mind is but a tool--a  highly finished one, it is true, but still a tool--to the Ego, or \"I.\"    We propose to give you a little mental drill work, toward the end that  you may be able more readily to distinguish the \"I\" from the mind, or  mental states. In this connection we would say that every part, plane,  and function of the mind is good, and necessary, and the student must not  fall into the error of supposing that because we tell him to set aside  first this part of the mind and then that part, that we are undervaluing  the mind, or that we regard it as an encumbrance or hindrance. Far from  this, we realize that it is _by the use of_ the mind that Man is enabled  to arrive at a knowledge of his true nature and Self, and that his  progress through many stages yet will depend upon the unfolding of his  mental faculties.    Man is now using but the lower and inferior parts of his mind, and he has  within his mental world great unexplored regions that far surpass  anything of which the human mind has dreamed. In fact, it is part of the  business of \"Raja Yoga\" to aid in unfolding these higher faculties and  mental regions. And so far from decrying the Mind, the \"Raja Yoga\"  teachers are chiefly concerned in recognizing the Mind's power and  possibilities, and directing the student to avail himself of the latent  powers that are inherent in his soul.    It is only by the mind that the teachings we are now giving you may be  grasped and understood, and used to your advantage and benefit. We are  talking direct to your mind now, and are making appeals to it, that it  may be interested and may open itself to what is ready to come into it  from its own higher regions. We are appealing to the Intellect to direct  its attention to this great matter, that it may interpose less resistance  to the truths that are waiting to be projected from the Spiritual Mind,  which knows the Truth.      MENTAL DRILL.    Place yourself in a calm, restful condition, that you may be able to  meditate upon the matters that we shall place before you for  consideration. Allow the matters presented to meet with a hospitable  reception from you, and hold a mental attitude of willingness to receive  what may be waiting for you in the higher regions of your mind.
