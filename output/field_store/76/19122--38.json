In November, 1879, her physician had decided that tubercles had  formed in the left lung, and that the right lung was much congested and  hardened.    In 1882 she had many hemorrhages, and gradually grew worse, so that she  could not use her left arm or shoulder without producing hemorrhage.    Mrs. Furlong, soon after her own healing, received a comforting  assurance from the Lord that her sister would be healed; but Miss  Jordan, herself, had not that assurance. At this time she took little or  no medicines, the physicians and the family having no confidence in  their curative effect; but, on the 1st of January, 1884, she had so many  chills and hemorrhages, that they sent for the family physician to aid  in checking, if possible, the severe attack.    During this apparently rapid descent deathward, Mrs. Furlong continued  to repeat to the family and to the physicians that the Lord would heal  her sister.    Miss Jordan was one day so low that she could just be aroused to take  her medicine. As Mrs. Furlong went to give it, Miss Jordan said to her,  \"Do you want to throw that medicine away?\" Mrs. Furlong said \"Yes,\" and  threw it away. Six hours of united waiting upon the Lord followed. They  were hours of pain. From nine in the morning till three in the afternoon  she suffered indescribable pain. A few minutes after three, the pain  left her, and with a bright look she said, \"I believe I'm better.\" She  wanted to rise and dress, but Mrs. Furlong advised her to rest through  the night. She said she had not, in five years, been so free from  weariness and pain.    The aged mother was sick in bed with that broken wrist, and Mrs. Furlong  feared that her sister's improved condition would shock and perplex her.    Miss Jordan lay on the lounge the most of the time for two days. One of  her expressions was, \"It's perfect bliss to lie here free from pain.\"  Her breathing became perfectly natural, and very soon the great hollow  place in the upper part of the chest, over the left lung, filled out.  Shortly before her healing she only weighed eighty pounds; but a few  months after her weight had increased to one hundred and twenty pounds.    She progressed in health rapidly, and on the second Sunday after the  healing came she attended church. The feeble mother was most sensitively  anxious lest her daughter should pursue some unwarrantable course which  should lead to relapse.    Miss Jordan's health steadily improved, but it was several months before  a cough entirely left her. You may be sure that doubters made the most  of that cough! _But it left her!_ At one time she brought on a slight  relapse by giving lessons in crayon drawing. She came to the conclusion  that the Lord had other work for her to do: and at this writing,  September, 1885, having prayerfully and watchfully followed the leadings  of the Lord, is a missionary among the freedmen of the South, and is  strong in health and in faith, \"giving glory to God.\"    One of the aged mother's perplexities was that the Lord should want her  to live on in such a helpless and useless condition, while her  daughters, who might be so useful, must die; but oh, how successful she  had by precept and example taught those daughters that \"He hath done all  things well!\" How patiently she suffered whatever she thought was the  Lord's will! How sweet was her constant thanksgiving! Said a pious  Christian neighbor, whose poor health restricted her attendance at  church, \"When I'm hungry for a blessing I go down to see old lady  Jordan.\"    After eight painful weeks, she so far recovered from the sickness  consequent on the broken and dislocated wrist as to move around feebly,  but sight and hearing were almost gone. Her leg was stiff, her hand  stiff, her wrist deformed, and her mind greatly impaired.    Miss Jordan became very hopeful, and received strong assurance, in  answer to prayer, that her mother might be healed. Mrs. Furlong received  no assurance whatever in her mother's case. There was a great deal of  talking and praying about it, in the family, and finally Mrs. Jordan  humbly claimed the Lord's help, beseeching Him that since He had  recorded that He would make the blind to see, the lame to walk, and the  deaf to hear, if it was His will He would heal her. This was the night  of June 16th, 1884.    In the morning Miss Jordan was so hopeful that she rose early, and  attentively listened to the movements in her mother's room. She called  the little family's attention to them, saying, \"Just listen to her;\" and  as, holding on by the banister, the aged mother came with her accustomed  slow movements down to the dining room, Miss Jordan said, to them, \"Now,  watch her.\"    According to the long habit of eight years, she began to reach out for  her cane, unconscious that she had been walking around her room with new  freedom. Miss Jordan went toward her and said, \"Mother, do you want your  cane?\" and, wondering, the old lady walked freely into the dining room.  They gathered around her, and said, \"Are you not healed, mother?\" and  she began to think _she was_, and sat down in her chair by the table.  Could she move her hand? The doubled-up thumb, and straight, stiff  finger, were _perfectly free_ and as _limber as ever_, and the stiff  wrist joint _moved with perfect freedom!_ She _heard as well as  anybody!_ Could she see? She went up-stairs to her Bible, whose blurred,  dim pages she had thought closed to her forever, and _she could read as  well as ever_, and without glasses! She could thread the finest needle.  Could she kneel and thank the Lord? She had not knelt for eight years.  Yes, she could kneel as well as when she served the Lord in her youth!    Christian reader, stop here and think what a joyful family that was that  June morning. That aged saint, of a little more than 85 years, was in  good health again! And her two daughters had been snatched from the jaws  of death! What a triumph of blessed memories to leave in legacy to that  young, hopeful, Christian son, who, in childhood, had himself repeatedly  proved that the Lord hears and answers prayer!    Mrs. Jordan has never used cane or crutch since that morning. She has  frequently walked five blocks, to go to her church; and, a few weeks  after her healing, she one day walked the distance of about fifteen  blocks. She has walked for hours in Lincoln Park, among the plants and  flowers, and she goes up and down stairs, and wherever she likes, as  well as anyone.    She has the use of her faculties, and an altogether comfortable use of  her sight, though that is not so acute as at first. Her earliest joy was  that she was permitted to see that the Lord had some purpose in sparing  her so long.    Dear Christian reader, shall the wonderful manifestation of that  \"purpose\" strengthen your faith? It helps me.    \"Is anything too hard for the Lord?\" \"No good thing will He withhold  from them that walk uprightly.\" \"If ye then, being evil, know how to  give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father  which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him.\" \"If we live  by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.\"    In the hopes of the Gospel,                                                            Miss E. Dryer.    150 Madison St., Chicago.      ALMOST A BANKRUPT.      A prominent Christian had just entered a merchant's counting-room, when  the head man of the place said to him, \"Let us kneel and ask God to help  me through, for without his help, I shall be a bankrupt before the  setting of the sun.\" So they knelt and prayed. That man went through the  pressure, and did not become a bankrupt.      \"HE COULD NOT FLEE FROM THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.\"      A clergyman of distinction gives this instance of the worthlessness of  all attempts to flee from the Power of the Spirit.    \"I looked out of my window one morning, while it was yet dark, and saw a  lady standing at my gate, leaning against a post, and evidently weeping  bitterly. I knew her. She was a member of the church, and was an  earnest, consistent Christian. She was married to one of the most bitter  Universalists I ever knew. I stepped down the steps to her, and asked,  'What is the matter?' She replied, 'Oh, my poor husband! I had so hoped  and prayed that he might be converted in this revival! and now he has  rode away, and says that _he will not come back till this religious  flurry is over_. What shall I do to bear up under this?'    \"I said, 'It is near the time for prayer. We will go and lay his case  before the Lord, and make _special request_ that God will bring him back  again under the power of the Spirit. The Lord can bring him home, and I  believe He will do it. We must pray for him.'    \"She dried her tears in a moment, and seemed to seize hold of this  'strong hope,' as we walked to the place of prayer. We found the room  crowded. It fell to my lot to lead the meeting.    \"At the opening, I stated the case of this Universalist husband, who had  undertaken to run away from the influence of the Spirit, by fleeing into  the country. I said that we must all pray _that the Holy Spirit may  follow him, overtake him, and bring him back again_, show him his sins,  and lead him to Jesus.    \"The meeting took up the case with great earnestness, and I could not  but feel that prayer would in some way be answered.    \"_But can you imagine our surprise when, at our evening prayer meeting,  this same Universalist came in_?    \"After standing a few minutes, till the opportunity offered, he said:    \"'I went away on horseback this morning, and told my wife I was going  into the country to stay till this flurry was over. I rode right over  the hills, back from the river, into the country, till I had got  eighteen miles away. _There, on the top of a hill, I was stopped as Paul  was, and just as suddenly_, and made to feel what a horrible sinner I  am.

But I suggest quite seriously that if the Germans  can give their philosophy to the Hottentots, there is no reason why they  should not give their sense of superiority to the Hottentots. If they can  see such fine shades between the Goth and the Gaul, there is no reason why  similar shades should not lift the savage above other savages; why any  Ojibway should not discover that he is one tint redder than the Dacotahs;  or any nigger in the Cameroons say he is not so black as he is painted. For  this principle of a quite unproved racial supremacy is the last and worst  of the refusals of reciprocity. The Prussian calls all men to admire the  beauty of his large blue eyes. If they do, it is because they have inferior  eyes: if they don't, it is because they have no eyes.    Wherever the most miserable remnant of our race, astray and dried up in  deserts, or buried for ever under the fall of bad civilisations, has some  feeble memory that men are men, that bargains are bargains, that there are  two sides to a question, or even that it takes two to make a quarrel--that  remnant has the right to resist the New Culture, to the knife and club  and the splintered stone. For the Prussian begins all his culture by that  act which is the destruction of all creative thought and constructive  action. He breaks that mirror in the mind, in which a man can see the face  of his friend and foe.          III    THE APPETITE OF TYRANNY      The German Emperor has reproached this country with allying itself with  \"barbaric and semi-oriental power.\" We have already considered in what  sense we use the word barbaric: it is in the sense of one who is hostile  to civilisation, not one who is insufficient in it. But when we pass from  the idea of the barbaric to the idea of the oriental, the case is even  more curious. There is nothing particularly Tartar in Russian affairs,  except the fact that Russia expelled the Tartars. The eastern invader  occupied and crushed the country for many years; but that is equally true  of Greece, of Spain, and even of Austria. If Russia has suffered from the  East she has suffered in order to resist it: and it is rather hard that  the very miracle of her escape should make a mystery about her origin.  Jonah may or may not have been three days inside a fish, but that does  not make him a merman. And in all the other cases of European nations who  escaped the monstrous captivity, we do admit the purity and continuity  of the European type. We consider the old Eastern rule as a wound, but  not as a stain. Copper-coloured men out of Africa overruled for centuries  the religion and patriotism of Spaniards. Yet I have never heard that  Don Quixote was an African fable on the lines of Uncle Remus. I have  never heard that the heavy black in the pictures of Velasquez was due  to a negro ancestry. In the case of Spain, which is close to us, we can  recognise the resurrection of a Christian and cultured nation after its  age of bondage. But Russia is rather remote; and those to whom nations are  but names in newspapers can really fancy, like Mr. Baring's friend, that  all Russian churches are \"mosques.\" Yet the land of Turgeniev is not a  wilderness of fakirs; and even the fanatical Russian is as proud of being  different from the Mongol, as the fanatical Spaniard was proud of being  different from the Moor.    The town of Reading, as it exists, offers few opportunities for piracy  on the high seas: yet it was the camp of the pirates in Alfred's day. I  should think it hard to call the people of Berkshire half-Danish, merely  because they drove out the Danes. In short, some temporary submergence  under the savage flood was the fate of many of the most civilised states  of Christendom; and it is quite ridiculous to argue that Russia, which  wrestled hardest, must have recovered least. Everywhere, doubtless, the  East spread a sort of enamel over the conquered countries, but everywhere  the enamel cracked. Actual history, in fact, is exactly opposite to  the cheap proverb invented against the Muscovite. It is not true to  say \"Scratch a Russian and you find a Tartar.\" In the darkest hour of  the barbaric dominion it was truer to say, \"Scratch a Tartar and you  find a Russian.\" It was the civilisation that survived under all the  barbarism. This vital romance of Russia, this revolution against Asia, can  be proved in pure fact; not only from the almost superhuman activity of  Russia during the struggle, but also (which is much rarer as human history  goes) by her quite consistent conduct since. She is the only great nation  which has really expelled the Mongol from her country, and continued to  protest against the presence of the Mongol in her continent. Knowing  what he had been in Russia, she knew what he would be in Europe. In  this she pursued a logical line of thought, which was, if anything, too  unsympathetic with the energies and religions of the East. Every other  country, one may say, has been an ally of the Turk; that is, of the Mongol  and the Moslem. The French played them as pieces against Austria; the  English warmly supported them under the Palmerston regime; even the young  Italians sent troops to the Crimea; and of Prussia and her Austrian vassal  it is nowadays needless to speak. For good or evil, it is the fact of  history that Russia is the only Power in Europe that has never supported  the Crescent against the Cross.    That, doubtless, will appear an unimportant matter; but it may become  important under certain peculiar conditions. Suppose, for the sake  of argument, that there were a powerful prince in Europe who had gone  ostentatiously out of his way to pay reverence to the remains of the  Tartar, Mongol and Moslem, which are left as outposts in Europe. Suppose  there were a Christian Emperor who could not even go to the tomb of  the Crucified, without pausing to congratulate the last and living  crucifier. If there were an Emperor who gave guns and guides and maps and  drill instructors to defend the remains of the Mongol in Christendom, what  should we say to him? I think at least we might ask him what he meant by  his impudence, when he talked about supporting a semi-oriental power. That  we support a semi-oriental power we deny. That he has supported an entirely  oriental power cannot be denied--no, not even by the man who did it.    But here is to be noted the essential difference between Russia and  Prussia; especially by those who use the ordinary Liberal arguments  against the latter. Russia has a policy which she pursues, if you will,  through evil and good; but at least so as to produce good as well as  evil. Let it be granted that the policy has made her oppressive to the  Finns and the Poles--though the Russian Poles feel far less oppressed than  do the Prussian Poles. But it is a mere historic fact, that if Russia  has been a despot to some small nations, she has been a deliverer to  others. She did, so far as in her lay, emancipate the Servians and the  Montenegrins. But whom did Prussia ever emancipate--even by accident? It  is indeed somewhat extraordinary that in the perpetual permutations of  international politics, the Hohenzollerns have never gone astray into the  path of enlightenment. They have been in alliance with almost everybody  off and on: with France, with England, with Austria, with Russia. Can  anyone candidly say that they have left on any one of these people the  faintest impress of progress or liberation? Prussia was the enemy of the  French Monarchy; but a worse enemy of the French Revolution. Prussia had  been an enemy of the Czar; but she was a worse enemy of the Duma. Prussia  totally disregarded Austrian rights: but she is to-day quite ready to  inflict Austrian wrongs. This is the strong particular difference between  the one empire and the other. Russia is pursuing certain intelligible and  sincere ends, which to her at least are ideals, and for which, therefore,  she will make sacrifices and will protect the weak. But the North German  soldier is a sort of abstract tyrant, everywhere and always on the side of  materialistic tyranny. This Teuton in uniform has been found in strange  places; shooting farmers before Saratoga and flogging soldiers in Surrey,  hanging niggers in Africa and raping girls in Wicklow; but never, by some  mysterious fatality, lending a hand to the freeing of a single city or the  independence of one solitary flag. Wherever scorn and prosperous oppression  are, there is the Prussian; unconsciously consistent, instinctively  restrictive, innocently evil; \"following darkness like a dream.\"    Suppose we heard of a person (gifted with some longevity) who had helped  Alva to persecute Dutch Protestants, then helped Cromwell to persecute  Irish Catholics, and then helped Claverhouse to persecute Scotch Puritans,  we should find it rather easier to call him a persecutor than to call  him a Protestant or a Catholic. Curiously enough this is actually the  position in which the Prussian stands in Europe. No argument can alter  the fact that in three converging and conclusive cases, he has been on  the side of three distinct rulers of different religions, who had nothing  whatever in common except that they were ruling oppressively. In these  three Governments, taken separately, one can see something excusable or at  least human. When the Kaiser encouraged the Russian rulers to crush the  Revolution, the Russian rulers undoubtedly believed they were wrestling  with an inferno of atheism and anarchy. A Socialist of the ordinary English  kind cried out upon me when I spoke of Stolypin, and said he was chiefly  known by the halter called \"Stolypin's Necktie.\" As a fact, there were many  other things interesting about Stolypin besides his necktie: his policy of  peasant proprietorship, his extraordinary personal courage, and"]]]
