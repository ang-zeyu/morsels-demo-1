In Japanese  philosophy and art (derived from the Chinese) the two are called _In_  and _Yo_ (In, feminine; Yo, masculine); and these little words, being  free from the limitations of their English correlatives, will be found  convenient, Yo to designate that which is simple, direct, primary,  active, positive; and In, that which is complex, indirect, derivative,  passive, negative. Things hard, straight, fixed, vertical, are Yo;  things soft, curved, horizontal, fluctuating, are In--and so on.    [Illustration 6: WILD CHERRY; MAPLE LEAF]    [Illustration 7: CALLAS IN YO]    In passing it may be said that the superiority of the line, mass, and  color composition of Japanese prints and kakemonos to that exhibited  in the vastly more pretentious easel pictures of modern Occidental  artists--a superiority now generally acknowledged by connoisseurs--is  largely due to the conscious following, on the part of the Japanese,  of this principle of sex-complementaries.    Nowhere are In and Yo more simply and adequately imaged than in the  vegetable kingdom. The trunk of a tree is Yo, its foliage, In; and  in each stem and leaf the two are repeated. A calla, consisting of  a single straight and rigid spadix embraced by a soft and tenderly  curved spathe, affords an almost perfect expression of the  characteristic differences between Yo and In and their reciprocal  relation to each other. The two are not often combined in such  simplicity and perfection in a single form. The straight, vertical  reeds which so often grow in still, shallow water, find their  complement in the curved lily-pads which lie horizontally on its  surface. Trees such as pine and hemlock, which are excurrent--those in  which the branches start successively (i.e., after the manner of time)  from a straight and vertical central stem--are Yo; trees such as  the elm and willow, which are deliquescent--those in which the trunk  dissolves as it were simultaneously (after the manner of space) into  its branches--are In. All tree forms lie in or between these two  extremes, and leaves are susceptible of a similar classification. It  will be seen to be a classification according to time and space,  for the characteristic of time is _succession_, and of space,  _simultaneousness_: the first is expressed symbolically by elements  arranged with relation to axial lines; the second, by elements  arranged with relation to focal points (Illustrations 6,7).    The student should train himself to recognize In and Yo in all  their Protean presentments throughout nature--in the cloud upon the  mountain, the wave against the cliff, in the tracery of trees against  the sky--that he may the more readily recognize them in his chosen  art, whatever that art may be. If it happens to be painting, he will  endeavor to discern this law of duality in the composition of every  masterpiece, recognizing an instinctive obedience to it in that  favorite device of the great Renaissance masters of making an  architectural setting for their groups of figures, and he will  delight to trace the law in all its ramifications of contrast between  complementaries in line, color, and mass (Illustration 8).    [Illustration 8: THE LAW OF POLARITY CLEOPATRA MELTING THE PEARL. BY  TIEPOLO]    With reference to architecture, it is true, generally speaking,  that architectural forms have been developed through necessity, the  function seeking and finding its appropriate form. For example, the  buttress of a Gothic cathedral was developed by the necessity of  resisting the thrust of the interior vaulting without encroaching upon  the nave; the main lines of a buttress conform to the direction of the  thrust, and the pinnacle with which it terminates is a logical shape  for the masonry necessary to hold the top in position (Illustration  9). Research along these lines is interesting and fruitful of result,  but there remains a certain number of architectural forms whose origin  cannot be explained in any such manner. The secret of their undying  charm lies in the fact that in them In and Yo stand symbolized and  contrasted. They no longer obey a law of utility, but an abstract  law of beauty, for in becoming sexually expressive as it were, the  construction itself is sometimes weakened or falsified. The familiar  classic console or modillion is an example: although in general  contour it is well adapted to its function as a supporting bracket,  embedded in, and projecting from a wall, yet the scroll-like ornament  with which its sides are embellished gives it the appearance of  not entering the wall at all, but of being stuck against it in some  miraculous manner. This defect in functional expressiveness is  more than compensated for by the perfection with which feminine  and masculine characteristics are expressed and contrasted in the  exquisite double spiral, opposed to the straight lines of the moulding  which it subtends (Illustration 10). Again, by fluting the shaft of a  column its area of cross-section is diminished but the appearance of  strength is enhanced because its masculine character--as a supporting  member resisting the force of gravity--is emphasized.    [Illustration 9: CROSS SECTION OF BUTTRESS.]    The importance of the so-called \"orders\" lies in the fact that they  are architecture epitomized as it were. A building consists of a wall  upholding a roof: support and weight. The type of the first is the  column, which may be conceived of as a condensed section of wall; and  of the second, the lintel, which may be conceived of as a condensed  section of roof. The column, being vertical, is Yo; the lintel, being  horizontal, is In. To mark an entablature with horizontal lines in the  form of mouldings, and the columns with vertical lines in the form  of flutes, as is done in all the \"classic orders,\" is a gain  in functional and sex expressiveness, and consequently in art  (Illustration 11).    [Illustration 10: CORINTHIAN MODILLION; CLASSIC CONSOLE; IONIC CAP]    The column is again divided into the shaft, which is Yo; and the  capital, which is In. The capital is itself twofold, consisting of a  curved member and an angular member. These two appear in their utmost  simplicity in the _echinus_ (In) and the _abacus_ (Yo) of a  Greek Doric cap. The former was adorned with painted leaf forms,  characteristically feminine, and the latter with the angular fret  and meander (Illustration 12). The Ionic capital, belonging to a more  feminine style, exhibits the abacus subordinated to that beautiful  cushion-shaped member with its two spirally marked volutes. This,  though a less rational and expressive form for its particular office  than is the echinus of the Doric cap, is a far more perfect symbol of  the feminine element in nature. There is an essential identity between  the Ionic cap and the classic console before referred to--although  superficially the two do not resemble each other--for a straight line  and a double spiral are elements common to both (Illustration 10).  The Corinthian capital consists of an ordered mass of delicately  sculptured leaf and scroll forms sustaining an abacus which though  relatively masculine is yet more curved and feminine than that of any  other style. In the caulicole of a Corinthian cap In and Yo are again  contrasted. In the unique and exquisite capital from the Tower of the  Winds at Athens, the two are well suggested in the simple, erect, and  pointed leaf forms of the upper part, contrasted with the complex,  deliquescent, rounded ones from which they spring. The essential  identity of principle subsisting between this cap and the Renaissance  baluster by San Gallo is easily seen (Illustration 13).    [Illustration 11]    [Illustration 12]    This law of sex-expressiveness is of such universality that it can  be made the basis of an analysis of the architectural ornament of any  style or period. It is more than mere opposition and contrast. The egg  and tongue motif, which has persisted throughout so many centuries and  survived so many styles, exhibits an alternation of forms resembling  phallic emblems. Yo and In are well suggested in the channeled  triglyphs and the sculptured metopes of a Doric frieze, in the  straight and vertical mullions and the flowing tracery of Gothic  windows, in the banded torus, the bead and reel, and other familiar  ornamented mouldings (Illustrations 14, 15, 16).    There are indications that at some time during the development  of Gothic architecture in France, this sex-distinction became a  recognized principle, moulding and modifying the design of a cathedral  in much the same way that sex modifies bodily structure. The masonic  guilds of the Middle Ages were custodians of the esoteric--which is  the theosophic--side of the Christian faith, and every student of  esotericism knows how fundamental and how far-reaching is this idea of  sex.    [Illustration 13: CAPITAL FROM THE TOWER OF THE WINDS, ATHENS;  CORINTHIAN CAP FROM HADRIAN BUILDINGS, ATHENS; ROSETTE FROM TEMPLE OF  MARS, ROME; CAULICULUS OF CORINTHIAN CAP; BULUSTER BY SAN GALLO]    [Illustration 14: EGG AND TONGUE; BEAD AND REEL; BANDED TORUS]    The entire cathedral symbolized the crucified body of Christ; its two  towers, man and woman--that Adam and that Eve for whose redemption  according to current teaching Christ suffered and was crucified. The  north or right-hand tower (\"the man's side\") was called the sacred  male pillar, Jachin; and the south, or left-hand tower (\"the woman's  side\"), the sacred female pillar, Boaz, from the two columns flanking  the gate to Solomon's Temple--itself an allegory to the bodily temple.

The Duchess was determined that her daughter, from the  earliest possible moment, should be prepared for her high station in a  way that would commend itself to the most respectable; her good,  plain, thrifty German mind recoiled with horror and amazement from the  shameless junketings at Carlton House; Drina should never be allowed to  forget for a moment the virtues of simplicity, regularity, propriety,  and devotion. The little girl, however, was really in small need of such  lessons, for she was naturally simple and orderly, she was pious without  difficulty, and her sense of propriety was keen. She understood very  well the niceties of her own position. When, a child of six, Lady Jane  Ellice was taken by her grandmother to Kensington Palace, she was put  to play with the Princess Victoria, who was the same age as herself. The  young visitor, ignorant of etiquette, began to make free with the toys  on the floor, in a way which was a little too familiar; but \"You must  not touch those,\" she was quickly told, \"they are mine; and I may  call you Jane, but you must not call me Victoria.\" The Princess's most  constant playmate was Victoire, the daughter of Sir John Conroy, the  Duchess's major-domo. The two girls were very fond of one another; they  would walk hand in hand together in Kensington Gardens. But little Drina  was perfectly aware for which of them it was that they were followed, at  a respectful distance, by a gigantic scarlet flunkey.    Warm-hearted, responsive, she loved her dear Lehzen, and she loved her  dear Feodora, and her dear Victoire, and her dear Madame de Spath.  And her dear Mamma, of course, she loved her too; it was her duty; and  yet--she could not tell why it was--she was always happier when she was  staying with her Uncle Leopold at Claremont. There old Mrs. Louis, who,  years ago, had waited on her Cousin Charlotte, petted her to her heart's  content; and her uncle himself was wonderfully kind to her, talking to  her seriously and gently, almost as if she were a grown-up person. She  and Feodora invariably wept when the too-short visit was over, and they  were obliged to return to the dutiful monotony, and the affectionate  supervision of Kensington. But sometimes when her mother had to stay at  home, she was allowed to go out driving all alone with her dear Feodora  and her dear Lehzen, and she could talk and look as she liked, and it  was very delightful.    The visits to Claremont were frequent enough; but one day, on a special  occasion, she paid one of a rarer and more exciting kind. When she was  seven years old, she and her mother and sister were asked by the King  to go down to Windsor. George IV, who had transferred his fraternal  ill-temper to his sister-in-law and her family, had at last grown tired  of sulking, and decided to be agreeable. The old rip, bewigged and  gouty, ornate and enormous, with his jewelled mistress by his side and  his flaunting court about him, received the tiny creature who was one  day to hold in those same halls a very different state. \"Give me your  little paw,\" he said; and two ages touched. Next morning, driving in his  phaeton with the Duchess of Gloucester, he met the Duchess of Kent and  her child in the Park. \"Pop her in,\" were his orders, which, to the  terror of the mother and the delight of the daughter, were immediately  obeyed. Off they dashed to Virginia Water, where there was a great  barge, full of lords and ladies fishing, and another barge with a band;  and the King ogled Feodora, and praised her manners, and then turned to  his own small niece. \"What is your favourite tune? The band shall play  it.\" \"God save the King, sir,\" was the instant answer. The Princess's  reply has been praised as an early example of a tact which was  afterwards famous. But she was a very truthful child, and perhaps it was  her genuine opinion.    III    In 1827 the Duke of York, who had found some consolation for the loss of  his wife in the sympathy of the Duchess of Rutland, died, leaving behind  him the unfinished immensity of Stafford House and L200,000 worth of  debts. Three years later George IV also disappeared, and the Duke of  Clarence reigned in his stead. The new Queen, it was now clear, would  in all probability never again be a mother; the Princess Victoria,  therefore, was recognised by Parliament as heir-presumptive; and the  Duchess of Kent, whose annuity had been doubled five years previously,  was now given an additional L10,000 for the maintenance of the Princess,  and was appointed regent, in case of the death of the King before the  majority of her daughter. At the same time a great convulsion took  place in the constitution of the State. The power of the Tories, who had  dominated England for more than forty years, suddenly began to crumble.  In the tremendous struggle that followed, it seemed for a moment as if  the tradition of generations might be snapped, as if the blind tenacity  of the reactionaries and the determined fury of their enemies could have  no other issue than revolution. But the forces of compromise triumphed:  the Reform Bill was passed. The centre of gravity in the constitution  was shifted towards the middle classes; the Whigs came into power; and  the complexion of the Government assumed a Liberal tinge. One of the  results of this new state of affairs was a change in the position of  the Duchess of Kent and her daughter. From being the protegees of an  opposition clique, they became assets of the official majority of the  nation. The Princess Victoria was henceforward the living symbol of the  victory of the middle classes.    The Duke of Cumberland, on the other hand, suffered a corresponding  eclipse: his claws had been pared by the Reform Act. He grew  insignificant and almost harmless, though his ugliness remained; he was  the wicked uncle still--but only of a story.    The Duchess's own liberalism was not very profound. She followed  naturally in the footsteps of her husband, repeating with conviction the  catchwords of her husband's clever friends and the generalisations  of her clever brother Leopold. She herself had no pretensions to  cleverness; she did not understand very much about the Poor Law and the  Slave Trade and Political Economy; but she hoped that she did her  duty; and she hoped--she ardently hoped--that the same might be said of  Victoria. Her educational conceptions were those of Dr. Arnold, whose  views were just then beginning to permeate society. Dr. Arnold's object  was, first and foremost, to make his pupils \"in the highest and truest  sense of the words, Christian gentlemen,\" intellectual refinements might  follow. The Duchess felt convinced that it was her supreme duty in life  to make quite sure that her daughter should grow up into a Christian  queen. To this task she bent all her energies; and, as the child  developed, she flattered herself that her efforts were not unsuccessful.  When the Princess was eleven, she desired the Bishops of London and  Lincoln to submit her daughter to an examination, and report upon the  progress that had been made. \"I feel the time to be now come,\" the  Duchess explained, in a letter obviously drawn up by her own hand, \"that  what has been done should be put to some test, that if anything has been  done in error of judgment it may be corrected, and that the plan for the  future should be open to consideration and revision... I attend almost  always myself every lesson, or a part; and as the lady about the  Princess is a competent person, she assists Her in preparing Her  lessons, for the various masters, as I resolved to act in that manner  so as to be Her Governess myself. When she was at a proper age she  commenced attending Divine Service regularly with me, and I have  every feeling that she has religion at Her heart, that she is morally  impressed with it to that degree, that she is less liable to error by  its application to her feelings as a Child capable of reflection.\"  \"The general bent of Her character,\" added the Duchess, \"is strength  of intellect, capable of receiving with ease, information, and with a  peculiar readiness in coming to a very just and benignant decision  on any point Her opinion is asked on. Her adherence to truth is of so  marked a character that I feel no apprehension of that Bulwark being  broken down by any circumstances.\" The Bishops attended at the Palace,  and the result of their examination was all that could be wished. \"In  answering a great variety of questions proposed to her,\" they reported,  \"the Princess displayed an accurate knowledge of the most important  features of Scripture History, and of the leading truths and precepts of  the Christian Religion as taught by the Church of England, as well as an  acquaintance with the Chronology and principal facts of English History  remarkable in so young a person. To questions in Geography, the use  of the Globes, Arithmetic, and Latin Grammar, the answers which the  Princess returned were equally satisfactory.\" They did not believe that  the Duchess's plan of education was susceptible of any improvement; and  the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was also consulted, came to the same  gratifying conclusion.    One important step, however, remained to be taken. So far, as the  Duchess explained to the Bishops, the Princess had been kept in  ignorance of the station that she was likely to fill. \"She is aware of  its duties, and that a Sovereign should live for others; so that when  Her innocent mind receives the impression of Her future fate, she  receives it with a mind formed to be sensible of what is to be expected  from Her, and it is to be hoped, she will be too well grounded in Her  principles to be dazzled with the station she is to look to.\" In the  following year it was decided that she should be enlightened on  this point. The well--known scene followed: the "]]]
