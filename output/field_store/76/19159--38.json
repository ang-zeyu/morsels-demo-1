In the orations  in question, these men proclaim the maxims adopted by their countrymen  and formative of their own character; they record their views of their  political relations and of their moral and spiritual nature, and publish  the principles of their designs and conduct. What the historian puts  into their mouths is no supposititious system of ideas, but an  uncorrupted transcript of their intellectual and moral habitudes.    Of these historians whom we must make thoroughly our own, with whom we  must linger long if we would live with their respective nations and  enter deeply into their spirit--of these historians to whose pages we  may turn, not for the purposes of erudition merely, but with a view to  deep and genuine enjoyment, there are fewer than might be imagined.  Herodotus, the Father, namely the Founder, of History, and Thucydides  have been already mentioned. Xenophon's _Retreat of the Ten Thousand_ is  a work equally original. Caesar's _Commentaries_ are the simple  masterpiece of a mighty spirit; among the ancients these annalists were  necessarily great captains and statesmen. In the Middle Ages, if we  except the bishops, who were placed in the very centre of the political  world, the monks monopolize this category as naive chroniclers who were  as decidedly isolated from active life as those elder annalists had been  connected with it. In modern times the relations are entirely altered.  Our culture is essentially comprehensive, and immediately changes all  events into historical representations. Belonging to the class in  question, we have vivid, simple, clear narrations--especially of  military transactions--which might fairly take their place with those of  Caesar. In richness of matter and fulness of detail as regards strategic  appliances and attendant circumstances, they are even more instructive.  The French \"Memoirs\" also fall under this category. In many cases these  are written by men of mark, though relating to affairs of little note;  they not unfrequently contain such a large amount of anecdotal matter  that the ground they occupy is narrow and trivial. Yet they are often  veritable masterpieces in history, as are those of Cardinal Retz, which,  in fact, trench on a larger historical field. In Germany such masters  are rare, Frederick the Great in his _Histoire de mon temps_ being an  illustrious exception. Writers of this order must occupy an elevated  position, for only from such a position is it possible to take an  extensive view of affairs--to see everything. This is out of the  question for him who from below merely gets a glimpse of the great world  through a miserable cranny.    II. The second kind of history we may call the _Reflective._ It is  history whose mode of representation is not really confined by the limits  of the time to which it relates, but whose spirit transcends the  present. In this second order a strongly marked variety of species may  be distinguished.    1. It is the aim of the investigator to gain a view of the entire  history of a people, of a country, or of the world in short, what we  call universal history. In this case the working up of the historical  material is the main point. The workman approaches his task with his own  spirit--a spirit distinct from that of the element he is to manipulate.    Here a very important consideration is the principles to which the  author refers the bearing and motives of the actions and events which he  describes, as well as those which determine the form of his narrative.  Among us Germans this reflective treatment and the display of ingenuity  which it affords assume a manifold variety of phases. Every writer of  history proposes to himself an original method. The English and French  confess to general principles of historical composition, their viewpoint  being more nearly that of cosmopolitan or national culture. Among us,  each labors to invent a purely individual point of view; instead of  writing history, we are always beating our brains to discover how  history ought to be written.    This first kind of Reflective history is most nearly akin to the  preceding, when it has no further aim than to present the annals of a  country complete. Such compilations (among which may be mentioned the  works of Livy, Diodorus Siculus, Johannes von Mueller's _History of  Switzerland_) are, if well performed, highly meritorious. Among the best  of the kind may be included such annalists as approach those of the  first-class writers who give so vivid a transcript of events that the  reader may well fancy himself listening to contemporaries and  eye-witnesses. But it often happens that the individuality of tone which  must characterize a writer belonging to a different culture is not  modified in accordance with the periods which such a record must  traverse. The spirit of the writer may be quite apart from that of the  times of which he treats. Thus Livy puts into the mouths of the old  Roman kings, consuls, and generals, such orations as would be delivered  by an accomplished advocate of the Livian era, and which strikingly  contrast with the genuine traditions of Roman antiquity--witness, for  example, the fable of Menenius Agrippa. In the same way he gives us  descriptions of battles as if he had been an actual spectator; but their  salient points would serve well enough for battles in any period, for  their distinctness contrasts, even in his treatment of chief points of  interest, with the want of connection and the inconsistency that prevail  elsewhere. The difference between such a compiler and an original  historian may be best seen by comparing Polybius himself with the style  in which Livy uses, expands, and abridges his annals in those periods of  which Polybius' account has been preserved. Johannes von Mueller, in the  endeavor to remain faithful in his portraiture to the times he  describes, has given a stiff, formal, pedantic aspect to his history. We  much prefer the narratives we find in old Tschudi; all is more naive and  natural than when appearing in the garb of a fictitious and affected  archaism.    A history which aspires to traverse long periods of time, or to be  universal, must indeed forego the attempt to give individual  representations of the past as it actually existed. It must foreshorten  its pictures by abstractions, and this includes not merely the omission  of events and deeds, but whatever is involved in the fact that Thought  is, after all, the most trenchant epitomist. A battle, a great victory,  a siege no longer maintains its original proportions, but is put off  with a mere allusion. When Livy, for instance, tells us of the war with  the Volsci, we sometimes have the brief announcement: \"This year war was  carried on with the Volsci.\"    2. A second species of Reflective history is what we may call the  pragmatical. When we have to deal with the past and occupy ourselves  with a remote world, a present rises into being for the mind--produced  by its own activity, as the reward of its labor. The occurrences are,  indeed, various; but the idea which pervades them-their deeper import  and connection--is one. This takes the occurrence out of the category of  the past and makes it virtually present. Pragmatical (didactic)  reflections, though in their nature decidedly abstract, are truly and  indefeasibly of the present, and quicken the annals of the dead past  with the life of today. Whether, indeed, such reflections are truly  interesting and enlivening depends on the writer's own spirit. Moral  reflections must here be specially noticed--the moral teaching expected  from history; the latter has not infrequently been treated with a direct  view to the former. It may be allowed that examples of virtue elevate  the soul and are applicable in the moral instruction of children for  impressing excellence upon their minds. But the destinies of people and  states, their interests, relations, and the complicated tissue of their  affairs, present quite another field. Rulers, statesmen, nations, are  wont to be emphatically commended to the teaching which experience  offers in history; yet what experience and history teach is this-that  peoples and governments have never learned anything from history, nor  have they acted on principles deduced from it. Each period is involved  in such peculiar circumstances, exhibits a condition of things so  strictly idiosyncratic, that its conduct must be regulated by  considerations connected with itself, and itself alone. Amid the  pressure of great events a general principle gives no help.    It is useless to revert to similar circumstances in the past. The pallid  shades of memory struggle in vain with the life and freedom of the  present. Looked at in this light nothing can be shallower than the  oft-repeated appeal to Greek and Roman examples during the French  Revolution; nothing is more diverse than the genius of those nations and  that of our times. Johannes von Mueller, in his _Universal History_ as  also in his _History of Switzerland_, had such moral aims in view. He  designed to prepare a body of political doctrines for the instruction of  princes, governments, and peoples (he formed a special collection of  doctrines and reflections, frequently giving us in his correspondence  the exact number of apothegms which he had compiled in a week); but he  cannot assert that this part of his labor was among the best he  accomplished. It is only a thorough, liberal, comprehensive view of  historical relations (such for instance, as we find in Montesquieu's  _L'Esprit des Lois_) that can give truth and interest to reflections of  this order. One Reflective history, therefore, supersedes another. The  materials are patent to every writer; each is prone to believe himself  capable of arranging and manipulating them, and we may expect that each  will insist upon his own spirit as that of the age in question."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12380"],[0,"Two Thousand Miles on an Automobile (#5)"],[1,"y; now and then a better road may be missed, but, in  the long run, that does not matter much, and the advantage of  keeping quite close to the straight line tells in the way of  mileage.    It is usually worse than useless to inquire in any place about the  roads beyond a radius of fifteen or twenty miles; plenty of  answers to all questions will be forthcoming, but they simply  mislead. In these days of railroads, farmers no longer make long  overland drives.    It is much easier to get information in small villages than in  cities. In a city about all one can learn is how to get out by the  shortest cut. Once out, the first farmer will give information  about the roads beyond.    In wet weather the last question will be, \"Is the road clayey or  bottomless anywhere?\" In dry weather, \"Is there any deep, soft  sand, and are there any sand hills?\"    The judgment of a man who is looking at the machine while he is  giving information is biased by the impressions as to what the  machine can do; make allowances for this and get, if possible, an  accurate description of the condition of any road which is  pronounced impassable, for you alone know what the machine can do,  and many a road others think you cannot cover is made with ease.    To the farmer the automobile is a traction engine, and he advises  the route accordingly; he will even speculate whether a given  bridge will support the extraordinary load.    Once we were directed to go miles out of our way over a series of  hills to avoid a stretch of road freshly covered with broken  stone, because our solicitous friends were sure the stones would  cut the rubber tires.    On the other hand, in Michigan, a well meaning old lady sent us  straight against the very worst of sand hills, not a weed, stone,  or hard spot on it, so like quicksand that the wheels sank as they  revolved; it was the only hill from which we retreated, to find  that farmers avoided that particular road on account of that  notorious hill, to find also a good, well-travelled road one mile  farther around. These instances are mentioned here to show how  hazardous it is to accept blindly directions given.    \"Is this the road to--?\" is the chauffeur's ever recurring shout  to people as he whizzes by. Four times out of five he gets a blank  stare or an idiotic smile. Now and then he receives a quick \"Yes\"  or \"No.\"    If time permits to stop and discuss the matter at length, do so  with a man; if passing quickly, ask a woman.    A woman will reply before a man comprehends what is asked; the  feminine mind is so much more alert than the masculine; then, too,  a woman would rather know what a man is saying than watch a  machine, while a man would rather see the machine than listen;--in  many ways the automobile differentiates the sexes.    Of a group of school children, the girls will answer more quickly  and accurately than the boys. What they know, they seem to know  positively. A boy's wits go wool gathering; he is watching the  wheels go round.    At Carlyle, on the way to South Bend, the tire was leaking  slightly, the nail had worked out. The road is a fine wide  macadam, somewhat rolling as South Bend is approached.    By the road taken South Bend is about one hundred miles from  Chicago,--the distance actually covered was some six or eight  miles farther, on account of wanderings from the straight and  narrow path. The hour was exactly two fifty-three, nearly eight  hours out, an average of about twelve and one-half miles an hour,  including all stops, and stops count in automobiling; they pull  the average down by jumps.    The extra tire was to be at Elkhart, farther on, and the problem  was to make the old one hold until that point would be reached.  Just as we were about to insert a plug to take the place of the  nail, a bicycle repairer suggested rubber bands. A dozen small  bands were passed through the little fork made by the broken eye  of a large darning-needle, stretched tight over a wooden handle  into which the needle had been inserted; some tire cement was  injected into the puncture, and the needle carrying the stretched  bands deftly thrust clear through; on withdrawing the needle the  bands remained, plugging the hole so effectually that it showed no  leak until some weeks later, when near Boston, the air began to  work slowly through the fabric.    Heavy and clumsy as are the large single-tube tires, it is quite  practicable to carry an extra one, though we did not. One is  pretty sure to have punctures,--though two in twenty-six hundred  miles are not many.    Nearly an hour was spent at South Bend; the river road, following  the trolley line, was taken to Elkhart.    Near Osceola a bridge was down for repairs; the stream was quite  wide and swift but not very deep. From the broken bridge the  bottom seemed to be sand and gravel, and the approaches on each  side were not too steep. There was nothing to do but go through or  lose many miles in going round. Putting on all power we went  through with no difficulty whatsoever, the water at the deepest  being about eighteen to twenty inches, somewhat over the hubs. If  the bottom of the little stream had been soft and sticky, or  filled with boulders, fording would have been out of the question.  Before attempting a stream, one must make sure of the bottom; the  depth is of less importance.    We did not run into Elkhart, but passed about two miles south in  sight of the town, arriving at Goshen at four fifteen. The roads  all through here seem to be excellent. From Goshen our route was  through Benton and Ligonier, arriving at Kendallville at exactly  eight o'clock.    The Professor with painstaking accuracy kept a log of the run,  noting every stop and the time lost.    In this first day's run of thirteen hours, the distance covered by  route taken was one hundred and seventy miles; deducting all  stops, the actual running time was nine hours and twenty minutes,  an average of eighteen miles per hour while the machine was in  motion.    For an ordinary road machine this is a high average over so long a  stretch, but the weather was perfect and the machine working like  a clock. The roads were very good on the whole, and, while the  country was rolling, the grades were not so steep as to compel the  use of the slow gear to any great extent.    The machine was geared rather high for any but favorable  conditions, and could make thirty-five miles an hour on level  macadam, and race down grade at an even higher rate. Before  reaching Buffalo we found the gearing too high for some grades and  for deep sand.    On the whole, the roads of Northern Indiana are good, better than  the roads of any adjoining State, and we were told the roads of  the entire State are very good. The system of improvement under  State laws seems to be quite advanced. It is a little galling to  the people of Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio to find the humble  Hoosier is far ahead in the matter of road building. If all the  roads between Chicago and New York averaged as good as those of  Indiana, the trip would present fewer difficulties and many more  delights.    The Professor notes that up to this point nine and three-quarters  gallons of gasoline have been consumed,--seventeen miles to the  gallon. When a motor is working perfectly, the consumption of  gasoline is always a pretty fair indication of the character of  the roads. Our machine was supposed to make twenty miles to the  gallon, and so it would on level roads, with the spark well  advanced and the intake valve operating to a nicety; but under  adverse conditions more gasoline is used, and with the  hill-climbing gear four times the gasoline is used per mile.    The long run of this first day was most encouraging; but the test  is not the first day, nor the second, nor even the first week, nor  the second, but the steady pull of week in and week out.    With every mile there is a theoretical decrease in the life and  total efficiency of the machine; after a run of five hundred or a  thousand miles this decrease is very perceptible. The trouble is  that while the distance covered increases in arithmetical  progression, the deterioration of the machine is in geometrical.  During the first few days a good machine requires comparatively  little attention each day; during the last weeks of a long tour it  requires double the attention and ten times the work.    No one who has not tried it can appreciate the great strain and  the wear and tear incidental to long rides on American roads.  Going at twenty or twenty-five miles an hour in a machine with  thirty-two-inch wheels and short wheel-base gives about the same  exercise one gets on a horse; one is lifted from the seat and  thrown from side to side, until you learn to ride the machine as  you would a trotter and take the bumps, accordingly. It is trying  to the nerves and the temper, it exercises every muscle in the  body, and at night one is ready for a good rest.    Lovers of the horse frequently say that automobiling is to  coaching as steam yachting is to sailing,--all of which argues the  densest ignorance concerning automobiling, since there is no sport  which affords anything like the same measure of exhilaration and  danger, and requires anything like the same amount of nerve, dash,  and daring. Since the days of Roman chariot racing the records of  man describe nothing that parallels automobile racing, and, so far  as we have any knowledge, chariot racing, save for the plaudits of  vast throngs of spectators, was tame and uneventful compared with  the frightful pace of sixty and eighty miles an hour in a  throbbing, bounding, careering road locomotive, over roads  practically unknown, passing persons, teams, vehicles, cattle,  obstacles, and obstructions of all kinds, with a thousand  hair-breadth escapes from wreck and destruction.    The sport may not be pretty and graceful; it lacks the sanction of  convention, the halo of tradition."]]]
