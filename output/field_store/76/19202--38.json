I must also direct especial attention  to a muscle belonging to the adductor group, which has another important  function especially related to vocalisation: it is sometimes called the  vocal muscle; it runs from the pyramid cartilage to the shield cartilage;  it apparently consists of two portions, an external, which acts with the  lateral ring-shield muscle and helps to approximate the vocal cords; and  another portion situated within the vocal cord itself, which by contracting  shortens the vocal cord and probably allows only the free edge to vibrate;  moreover, when not contracting, by virtue of the perfect elasticity of  muscle the whole thickness of the cord, including this vocal muscle, can be  stretched and thrown into vibration (_vide_ fig. 8). In the production of  chest notes the whole vocal cord is vibrating, the difference in the pitch  depending upon the tension produced by the contraction of the tensor  (ring-shield) muscle. When, however, the change from the lower to the upper  register occurs, as the photographs taken by Dr. French and reproduced in a  lecture at the Royal Institution by Sir Felix Semon show, the vocal cords  become shorter, thicker, and rounder; and this can be explained by  supposing that the inner portion of the vocal muscle contracts at the break  from the lower to the upper register (_vide_ fig. 11); and that as a result  only the free edges of the cords vibrate, causing a change in the quality  of the tone. As the scale is ascended the photographs show that the cords  become longer and tenser, which we may presume is due to the continued  action of the tensor muscle. Another explanation is possible, viz. that in  the lower register the two edges of the vocal cords are comparatively thick  strings. When the break occurs, owing to the contraction of the inner  portion of the vocal muscle, we have a transformation into thin strings, at  first short, but as the pitch of the note rises, the thin string formed by  the edge of the vocal cord is stretched and made longer by the tensor. It  should be mentioned that Aikin and many other good authorities do not hold  this view.    [Illustration: FIG. 7 A-A', Ring cartilage.

The ventricle above the vocal cords is  seen with the surface sloping upwards towards the mid line.]    A diagram showing a vertical section through the middle of the larynx at  right angles to the vocal cords shows some important facts in connection  with the mechanism of this portion of the vocal instrument (_vide_ fig. 8).  It will be observed that the sound-pipe just beneath the membranous reed  assumes the form of a cone, thus the expired air is driven like a wedge  against the closed glottis. Another fact of importance may be observed,  that above the vocal cords on either side is a pouch called a ventricle,  and the upper surfaces of the vocal cords slope somewhat upwards from  without inwards, so that the pressure of the air from above tends to press  the edges together. The force of the expiratory blast of air from below  overcomes the forces which approximate the edges of the cords and throws  them into vibration. With each vibration of the membranous reeds the valve  is opened, and as in the case of the siren a little puff of air escapes;  thus successive rhythmical undulations of the air are produced,  constituting the sound waves. The pitch of the note depends upon the number  of waves per second, and the _register_ of the voice therefore depends upon  two factors: (1) the size of the voice-box, or larynx, and the length of  the cords, and (2) the action of the neuro-muscular mechanism whereby the  length, approximation, and tension of the vocal cords can be modified when  singing from the lowest note to the highest note of the register.    Thus the compass of the--      Bass voice is D to f     75- 354 vibs. per sec.    Tenor      \"  c \"  c''  133- 562   \"      \"    Contralto  \"  e \"  g''  167- 795   \"      \"    Soprano    \"  b \"  f''' 239-1417   \"      \"    The complete compass of the human voice therefore ranges from about D 75 to  f''' 1417 vibrations per second, but the quality of the same notes varies  in different individuals.    [Illustration: Fig. 9]    [Description: Fig. 9.--_Description of the laryngoscope and its mode of  use_.--The laryngoscope consists of a concave mirror which is fixed on the  forehead with a band in such a way that the right eye looks through the  hole in the middle. This mirror reflects the light from a lamp placed  behind the right side of the patient, who is told to open the mouth and put  out the tongue. The observer holds the tongue out gently with a napkin and  reflects the light from the mirror on his forehead on to the back of the  throat. The small mirror, set at an angle of 45 deg. with the shaft, is of  varying size, from half an inch to one inch in diameter, and may be fixed  in a handle according to the size required. The mirror is warmed to prevent  the moisture of the breath obscuring the image, and it is introduced into  the back of the throat in such a manner that the glottis appears reflected  in it. The light from the lamp is reflected by the concave mirror on to the  small mirror, which, owing to its angle of 45 deg., illuminates the glottis and  reflects the image of the glottis with the vocal cords.]    The discovery of the laryngoscope by Garcia enabled him by its means to see  the vocal cords in action and how the reed portion of the vocal instrument  works (_vide_ fig. 9 and description). The chink of the glottis or the  opening between the vocal cords as seen in the mirror of the laryngoscope  varies in size. The vocal cords or ligaments appear dead white and contrast  with the surrounding pink mucous membrane covering the remaining structures  of the larynx. Fig. 10 shows the appearance of the glottis in respiration  and vocalisation. The vocal cords of a man are about seven-twelfths of an  inch in length, and those of a boy (before the voice breaks) or of a woman  are about five-twelfths of an inch; and there is a corresponding difference  in size of the voice-box or larynx. This difference in length of the vocal  cords accounts for the difference in the pitch of the speaking voice and  the register of the singing voice of the two sexes. We should also expect a  constant difference in the length of the cords of a tenor and a bass in the  male, and of the contralto and soprano in the female, but such is not the  case. It is not possible to determine by laryngoscopic examination what is  the natural register of an individual's voice. The vocal cords may be as  long in the tenor as in the bass; this shows what an important part the  resonator plays in the timbre or quality of the voice. Still, it is  generally speaking true, that a small larynx is more often associated with  a higher pitch of voice than a large larynx.    [Illustration: Fig. 10]    [Description: Fig. 10.--Diagram (modified from Aikin) illustrating the  condition of the vocal cords in respiration, whispering, and phonation. (1)  Ordinary breathing; the cords are separated and the windpipe can be seen.  (2) Deep inspiration; the cords are widely separated and a greater extent  of the windpipe is visible. (3) During the whisper the vocal cords are  separated, leaving free vent for air through the glottis; consequently  there is no vibration and no sound produced by the cords. (4) The soft  vocal note, or aspirate, shows that the chink of the glottis is not  completely closed, and especially the rima respiratoria (the space between  the vocal processes of the pyramidal cartilages.) (5) Strong vocal note,  produced in singing notes of the lower register. (6) Strong vocal note,  produced in singing notes of the higher register.]    Musical notes are comprised between 27 and 4000 vibrations per second. The  extent and limit of the voice may be given as between C 65 vibrations per  second and f''' 1417 vibrations per second, but this is most exceptional,  it is seldom above c''' 1044 per second. The compass of a well-developed  singer is about two to two and a half octaves. The normal pitch, usually  called the \"diapason normal,\" is that of a tuning-fork giving 433  vibrations per second.

Were it only for the admirable      example of such an individual guiding the reigns of the      government of a devoted people, it is most ardently to be hoped      that Poland may triumph over her enemies, and be raised to that      rank from which she was degraded only by the basest of      treasons.--_Fletcher's History of Poland._        [3] The common food of the poor.    As the pronunciation of the Polish language is attended with some  difficulty, the author of this work has, in his advertisement, subjoined  the following hints, taken principally from the \"Letters Literary and  Political on Poland, Edinburgh, 1823.\"    All vowels are sounded as in French and Italian; and there are no  diphthongs, every vowel being pronounced distinctly. The consonants are  the same as in English, except    _w_, which is sounded like _v_, at the beginning of a word; thus,  Warsawa--_Varsafa_; in the middle or at the end of a word it has the  sound of _f_, as in the instance already cited; and Narew--_Nareff_.    _c_, like _tz_, and never like _k_; thus, Pac is sounded _Patz_.    _g_, like _g_ in Gibbon; thus, _Oginski_.    _ch_, like the Greek [Greek: ch] or _k_; thus, Lech--_Lek_.    _cz_, like the English _tch_ in pitch;--thus, Czartoryski pronounce  _Tchartoryski_.    _sz_, like _sh_ in _shape_; thus, Staszyc like _Stashytz_.    _szcz_, like _shtch_; thus, Szczerbiec like _Shtcherbietz_.    _rz_, like _j_ in _je_, with a slight sound of _r_; thus,  Rzewuski--_Rjevuski_.             *       *       *       *       *      WHITE'S BAMPTON LECTURES.      Dr. Dibdin has prefixed the subsequent Note to one of these Lectures  (Character of Christ compared with that of Mahomet), which he has  reprinted in vol. iii. of the _Sunday Library_:--        \"Of all the sermons preached in this, or in any other country,      THESE are perhaps the most celebrated; or, if this observation      require qualification, the only exception may be in favour of      those of the _Petit Careme_ of MASILLON. For three successive      terms, the church of St. Mary's, at Oxford, was crowded with an      auditory breathless in admiration of the splendour of diction      and vividness of imagery manifested in these discourses. The      subject treated of--'_A Comparison of Mahometanism and      Christianity in their History, their Evidences, and their      Effects_'--was new and striking in the pulpit of the University      Church. A great deal of highly wrought expectation, from more      than a whisper spread abroad of the sources whence the chief      materials had been derived, preceded their publicity; and the      preacher, although by no means remarkable for elegance of      manner, or ductility and melody of voice, applied his whole      energies to the task of giving power and effect to his delivery.      He succeeded, greatly beyond his own expectations; and the      University rung with his praises. The fame which ensued was      merited; for the public, till then satisfied with the tame      polish and cold invective of BLAIR, became delighted by the      union of such harmony of language, skilfulness of argument, and      singularity of research, as were blended in these lectures. Yet      it may be questioned, not only whether a display of similar      talent would _now_ receive the like applause, but whether many      subsequent courses of Bampton lectures have not rendered a more      essential service to Christianity.        \"But, extraordinary as was the result of the _preaching_ of      these Bampton lectures, perhaps a more extraordinary history      belongs to their _composition_; and posterity will learn, with      wonder, and perhaps with mingled pity and contempt, that the      measures resorted to by the Laudian Professor of Arabic, in      order to impose upon his best friend and most able coadjutor,      DR. PARR, form such a tissue of petty artifice and intrigue as      scarcely to be believed. The whole plot, however, is minutely      and masterly developed in Dr. Johnstone's _Life of Dr. Parr_,      vol. i. p. 216-281, to which I refer the curious reader for some      very singular particulars. The facts, as there delineated, are      simply these:--A secret correspondence was carried on between      Professor White and Mr. Badcock, a dissenting minister of      Devonshire, who furnished the greater part of the materials of      these lectures; which materials, copied out by Professor White,      with a few emendations and additions, were sent to Dr. Parr as      the exclusive composition of the Professor. Several of the      lectures are wholly Badcock's, by the express admission of Dr.      White; and the undeniable evidence of a douceur of 500l. from      the Professor to Mr. Badcock, is a sufficiently solid proof of      the value in which the former held the labours of the latter.      There could be no violation of any great moral feeling in the      transaction thus simply considered; for the labourer was worthy      of his hire; but the evasive subtleties and shuffling      subterfuges by which the literary intercourse was stubbornly      denied, and attempted to be set aside, by Professor White, is      matter of perfect astonishment! In the mean while, Dr. Parr      steadily continued his critical labours, believing that the      Professor sought no _aid_ but his _own_. He revised, added, and      polished at his entire discretion; and while it is allowed that      _one-fifth_ at least, of these lectures are the work of his      learned hand, he undoubtedly gave to the whole its last and most      effectual polish. The history which belongs to his discovery of      the collateral aid of Badcock, is curious and amusing; but can      have no place here. It does great credit to the head and heart      of Dr. Parr. Thus the reader will observe that no small interest      is attached to the volume from which the ensuing extracts are      made: a volume, full, doubtless, of extensive and learned      research, and exhibiting a style remarkable alike for its      consummate art and harmonious copiousness.\"             *       *       *       *       *      WEALTH OF HENRY VII.      The hoard amassed by Henry, and \"most of it under his own key and  keeping, in secret places at Richmond,\" is said to have amounted to near  1,800,000 l., which, according to our former conjectures, would be  equivalent to about 16,000,000 l.; an amount of specie so immense as to  warrant a suspicion of exaggeration, in an age when there was no control  from public documents on a matter of which the writers of history were  ignorant. Our doubts of the amount amassed by Henry are considerably  warranted by the computation of Sir W. Petty, who, a century and a half  later, calculated the whole specie of England at only 6,000,000 l.--This  hoard, whatever may have been its precise extent, was too great to be  formed by frugality, even under the penurious and niggardly Henry. A  system of extortion was employed, which \"the people, into whom there is  infused for the preservation of monarchies a natural desire to discharge  their princes, though it be with the unjust charge of their counsellors,  did impute unto Cardinal Morton and Sir Reginald Bray, who, as it after  appeared, as counsellors of ancient authority with him, did so second  his humours as nevertheless they did temper them. Whereas Empson and  Dudley, that followed, being persons that had no reputation with him,  otherwise than by the servile following of his bent, did not give way  only as the first did, but shaped his way to those extremities for which  himself was touched with remorse at his death.\"[4] The means of exaction  chiefly consisted in the fines incurred by slumbering laws, in commuting  for money other penalties which fell on unknown offenders, and in the  sale of pardons and amnesties. Every revolt was a fruitful source of  profit. When the great confiscations had ceased, much remained to be  gleaned by true or false imputations of participation in treason. To be  a dweller in a disaffected district, was, for the purposes of the king's  treasure, to be a rebel. No man could be sure that he had not incurred  mulcts, or other grievous penalties, by some of those numerous laws  which had so fallen into disuse by their frivolous and vexatious nature  as to strike before they warned. It was often more prudent to compound  by money, even in false accusations, than to brave the rapacity and  resentment of the king and his tools. Of his chief instruments, \"Dudley  was a man of good family, eloquent, and one that could put hateful  business into good language; Empson, the son of a sieve-maker, of  Towcester, triumphed in his deeds, putting off all other respects. They  were privy counsellors and lawyers, who turned law and justice into  wormwood and rapine.\"[5] They threw into prison every man whom they  could indict, and confined him, without any intention to prosecute, till  he ransomed himself. They prosecuted the mayors and other magistrates of  the city of London, for pretended or trivial neglects of duty, long  after the time of the alleged offences; subservient judges imposed  enormous fines, and the king imprisoned during his own life some of the  contumacious offenders. Alderman Hawes is said to have died heartbroken  by the terror and anguish of these proceedings. [6] They imprisoned and  fined juries who hesitated to lend their aid when it was deemed  convenient to seek it. To these, Lord Bacon tells us, were added \"other  courses fitter to be buried than repeated.\"[7] Emboldened by long  success, they at last disdained to observe \"_the half face of  justice_,\"[8] but summoning the wealthy and timid before them in private  houses, \"shuffled up\" a summary examination without a jury, and levied  such exactions as were measured only by the fears and fortunes of their  victims.--_Mackintosh's England_,"]]]
