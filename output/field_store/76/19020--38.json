[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],[0,"Legends of the Gods (#4)"],[1," Boats of Ra,  sail, and her four legs are the four cardinal points which cannot be  changed.  The region above her back is the heaven in which Ra reigns  over the beings who pass thereto from this earth when they die, and  here was situated the home of the gods and the celestial spirits who  govern this world.    When Ra had made a heaven for himself, and had arranged for a  continuance of life on the earth, and the welfare of human beings, he  remembered that at one time when reigning on earth he had been bitten  by a serpent, and had nearly lost his life through the bite.  Fearing  that the same calamity might befall his successor, he determined to  take steps to destroy the power of all noxious reptiles that dwelt on  the earth.  With this object in view he told Thoth to summon Keb, the  Earth-god, to his presence, and this god having arrived, Ra told him  that war must be made against the serpents that dwelt in his dominions.  He further commanded him to go to the god Nu, and to tell him to set a  watch over all the reptiles that were in the earth and in water, and to  draw up a writing for every place in which serpents are known to be,  containing strict orders that they are to bite, no one.  Though these  serpents knew that Ra was retiring from the earth, they were never to  forget that his rays would fall upon them.  In his place their father  Keb was to keep watch over them, and he was their father for ever.    As a further protection against them Ra promised to impart to magicians  and snake-charmers the particular word of power, hekau, with which he  guarded himself against the attacks of serpents, and also to transmit  it to his son Osiris.  Thus those who are ready to listen to the  formulae of the snake-charmers shall always be immune from the bites of  serpents, and their children also.  From this we may gather that the  profession of the snake-charmer is very ancient, and that this class of  magicians were supposed to owe the foundation of their craft to a  decree of Ra himself.    Ra next sent for the god Thoth, and when he came into the presence of  Ra, he invited him to go with him to a distance, to a place called  \"Tuat,\" i.e., hell, or the Other World, in which region he had  determined to make his light to shine.  When they arrived there he told  Thoth, the Scribe of Truth, to write down on his tablets the names of  all who were therein, and to punish those among them who had sinned  against him, and he deputed to Thoth the power to deal absolutely as he  pleased with all the beings in the Tuat.  Ra loathed the wicked, and  wished them to be kept at a distance from him.  Thoth was to be his  vicar, to fill his place, and \"Place of Ra,\" was to be his name.  He  gave him power to send out a messenger (hab), so the Ibis (habi) came  into being.  All that Thoth would do would be good (khen), therefore  the Tekni bird of Thoth came into being.  He gave Thoth power to  embrace (anh) the heavens, therefore the Moon-god (Aah) came into  being.  He gave Thoth power to turn back (anan) the Northern peoples,  therefore the dog-headed ape of Thoth came into being.  Finally Ra told  Thoth that he would take his place in the sight of all those who were  wont to worship Ra, and that all should praise him as God.  Thus the  abdication of Ra was complete.    In the fragmentary texts which follow we are told how a man may benefit  by the recital of this legend.  He must proclaim that the soul which  animated Ra was the soul of the Aged One, and that of Shu, Khnemu (?),  Heh, &c., and then he must proclaim that he is Ra himself, and his word  of power Heka.  If he recites the Chapter correctly he shall have life  in the Other World, and he will be held in greater fear there than  here.  A rubric adds that he must be dressed in new linen garments, and  be well washed with Nile water; he must wear white sandals, and his  body must be anointed with holy oil.  He must burn incense in a censer,  and a figure of Maat (Truth) must be painted on his tongue with green  paint.  These regulations applied to the laity as well as to the  clergy.          III.        THE LEGEND OF RA AND ISIS.        The original text of this very interesting legend is written in the  hieratic character on a papyrus preserved at Turin, and was published  by Pleyte and Rossi in their Corpus of Turin Papyri.[FN#16]  French and  German translations of it were published by Lefebure,[FN#17] and  Wiedemann[FN#18] respectively, and summaries of its contents were given  by Erman[FN#19] and Maspero.[FN#20]  A transcript of the hieratic text  into hieroglyphics, with transliteration and translation, was published  by me in 1895.[FN#21]        [FN#16]  Papyrus de Turin, pll. 31, 77, 131-138.    [FN#17]  A. Z., 1883, p. 27 ff.    [FN#18]  Die Religion, p. 29.    [FN#19]  Aegypten, p. 359 ff.    [FN#20]  Les Origines, V. 162-4.      [FN#21]  First Steps in Egyptian, p. 241 ff.        It has already been seen that the god Ra, when retiring from the  government of this world, took steps through Thoth to supply mankind  with words of power and spells with which to protect themselves against  the bites of serpents and other noxious reptiles.  The legend of the  Destruction of Mankind affords no explanation of this remarkable fact,  but when we read the following legend of Ra and Isis we understand why  Ra, though king of the gods, was afraid of the reptiles which lived in  the kingdom of Keb.  The legend, or \"Chapter of the Divine God,\" begins  by enumerating the mighty attributes of Ra as the creator of the  universe, and describes the god of \"many names\" as unknowable, even by  the gods.  At this time Isis lived in the form of a woman who possessed  the knowledge of spells and incantations, that is to say, she was  regarded much in the same way as modern African peoples regard their  \"medicine-women,\" or \"witch-women.\"  She had used her spells on men,  and was tired of exercising her powers on them, and she craved the  opportunity of making herself mistress of gods and spirits as well as  of men.  She meditated how she could make herself mistress both of  heaven and earth, and finally she decided that she could only obtain  the power she wanted if she possessed the knowledge of the secret name  of Ra, in which his very existence was bound up.  Ra guarded this name  most jealously, for he knew that if he revealed it to any being he  would henceforth be at that being's mercy.  Isis saw that it was  impossible to make Ra declare his name to her by ordinary methods, and  she therefore thought out the following plan.  It was well known in  Egypt and the Sudan at a very early period that if a magician obtained  some portion of a person's body, e.g., a hair, a paring of a nail, a  fragment of skin, or a portion of some efflux from the body, spells  could be used upon them which would have the effect of causing grievous  harm to that person.  Isis noted that Ra had become old and feeble, and  that as he went about he dribbled at the mouth, and that his saliva  fell upon the ground.  Watching her opportunity she caught some of the  saliva of the and mixing it with dust, she moulded it into the form of  a large serpent, with poison-fangs, and having uttered her spells over  it, she left the serpent lying on the path, by which Ra travelled day  by day as he went about inspecting Egypt, so that it might strike at  him as he passed along.  We may note in passing that the Banyoro in the  Sudan employ serpents in killing buffaloes at the present day.  They  catch a puff-adder in a noose, and then nail it alive by the tip of its  tail to the round in the middle of a buffalo track, so that when an  animal passes the reptile may strike at it.  Presently a buffalo comes  along, does what it is expected to do, and then the puff-adder strikes  at it, injects its poison, and the animal dies soon after.  As many as  ten buffaloes have been killed in a day by one puff-adder.  The body of  the first buffalo is not eaten, for it is regarded as poisoned meat,  but all the others are used as food.[FN#22]        [FN#22]  Johnston, Uganda, vol. ii., p. 584.  The authority for this  statement is Mr. George Wilson, formerly Collector in Unyoro.        Soon after Isis had placed the serpent on the Path, Ra passed by, and  the reptile bit him, thus injecting poison into his body.  Its effect  was terrible, and Ra cried out in agony.  His jaws chattered, his lips  trembled, and he became speechless for a time; never before had be  suffered such pain.  The gods hearing his cry rushed to him, and when  he could speak he told them that he had been bitten by a deadly  serpent.  In spite of all the words of power which were known to him,  and his secret name which had been hidden in his body at his birth, a  serpent had bitten him, and he was being consumed with a fiery pain.  He then commanded that all the gods who had any knowledge of magical  spells should come to him, and when they came, Isis, the great lady of  spells, the destroyer of diseases, and the revivifier of the dead, came  with them.  Turning to Ra she said, \"What hath happened, O divine  Father?\" and in answer the god told her that a serpent had bitten him,  that he was hotter than fire and colder than water, that his limbs  quaked, and that he was losing the power of sight.  Then Isis said to  him with guile, \"Divine Father, tell me thy name, for he who uttereth  his own name shall live.\"  Thereupon Ra proceeded to enumerate the  various things that he had done, and to describe his creative acts, and  ended his speech to Isis by saying, that he was Khepera in the morning,  Ra at noon, and Temu in the evening.  Apparently he thought that the  naming of these three great names would satisfy Isis, and that she  would immediately pronounce a word of power and stop the pain in his  body, which, during his speech, had become more acute.  Isis, however,  was not deceived, and she knew well that Ra had not declared to her his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9457"],[0,"Travels in Arabia; comprehending an account of those territories in Hedjaz which (#4)"],[1,"ey; accompanied with a request that I should repair immediately to  Tayf, with the same messenger who had brought the letter. In a  postscript, Seyd Aly Odjakly was enjoined to order the messenger to take  me by the upper road to Tayf, which leaves Mekka to the south, the lower  and more usual road passing through the middle of that town.    [p.7] The invitation of a Turkish Pasha is a polite command; whatever,  therefore, might be my reluctance to go at this time to Tayf, I could  not avoid, under the present circumstances, complying with the Pashas  wishes; and, notwithstanding the secret aversion I had to receive a  present at his hands instead of a loan, I could not refuse to accept the  clothes and money, without hurting the pride and exciting the resentment  of a chief, whose good graces it was now my principal aim to  conciliate. [Some persons, perhaps, consider it an honour to receive  presents from Pashas; but I think differently. I know that the real  motive of a Turk in making presents, is either to get double the value  in return, (which could not be the case with me,) or to gratify his own  pride in showing to his courtiers that he deigns to be liberal towards a  person whom he holds infinitely below him in station or worth. I have  often witnessed the sneers of the donor and his people on making such  presents; and their sentiments are sometimes expressed by the saying,  Look, he has thrown a morsel to this dog! Few Europeans may, perhaps,  agree with me in this respect, but my knowledge authorises me to form  this opinion; and the only advice which I can give to travellers who  would not lower themselves in the estimation of Turkish grandees, is to  be always ready, on similar occasions, to return the supposed favour  two-fold. As for myself, I had but seldom occasion to make presents  during my travels; and this was the only one that I was ever obliged to  accept.] I likewise understood the meaning of the postscript, although  Seyd Aly was not aware of it; but, on this point, I flattered myself I  should be a match for the Pasha and his people.    As the invitation was very pressing, I left Djidda in the evening of the  same day on which the messenger arrived, after supping with Seyd Aly, in  company with a great number of Hadjis from all parts of the world; for  the fast of Ramadhan had already commenced, and during this month  everybody displays as much hospitality and splendour as he possibly can,  particularly in the supper after sun-set. Distrusting in some measure  the Pashas intentions, I thought it necessary to carry a full purse to  Tayf; I therefore changed the whole of the three thousand piastres which  I had received from Yahya Effendi into gold, and put it in my girdle. A  person who has money has little to fear among Osmanlis,    [p.8] except the loss of it; but I thought that I might stand in need of  what I had, either as a bribe, or to facilitate my departure from Tayf.  I was, however, fortunately mistaken in both these conjectures.    I shall add here some remarks on Djidda and its inhabitants. The town is  built upon a slightly rising ground, the lowest side of which is washed  by the sea. Along the shore it extends in its greatest length for about  fifteen hundred paces, while the breadth is no where more than half that  space. It is surrounded on the land-side by a wall, in a tolerable state  of repair, but of no strength. It had been constructed only a few years  since by the joint labours of the inhabitants themselves, who were  sensible that they possessed no protection against the Wahabis in the  ancient half-ruined wall, built, A.H. 917, by Kansoue el Ghoury, Sultan  of Egypt. [See Kotobeddin, History of Mekka.] The present structure is a  sufficient barrier against Arabs, who have no artillery. At every  interval of forty or fifty paces, the wall is strengthened by watch-  towers, with a few rusty guns. A narrow ditch was also carried along its  whole extent, to increase the means of defence; and thus Djidda enjoys,  in Arabia, the reputation of being an impregnable fortress. On the sea-  shore, in front of the town, the ancient wall remains, but in a state of  decay. At the northern extremity, near the spot where the new wall is  washed by the sea, stands the Governors residence; and at the southern  extremity is a small castle, mounting eight or ten guns. There is,  besides, a battery, to guard the entrance from the side of the sea, and  command the whole harbour. Here is mounted an immense old piece of  ordnance, which carries a ball of five hundred pounds, and is so  celebrated all over the Red Sea, that the very fame of it is a  protection to Djidda. The approach into the town from the sea is by two  quays, where small boats discharge the cargoes of the large ships, these  being obliged to    [p.9] anchor in the roadstead, about two miles from shore; none but the  vessels called say, (the smallest that navigate the Red Sea,)  approaching close to the shore. The quays are shut every evening about  sunset; thus all communication is prevented, at night, between the town  and the shipping.    On the land side Djidda has two gates; the Báb Mekka on the east side,  and Báb el Medina on the north. A small gate in the south wall has  lately been filled up. The area inclosed by the new wall (about three  thousand paces in circuit) and the sea, is not entirely covered with  buildings. A broad piece of open ground extends the whole length of the  interior of the wall; and there is, besides, a good deal of waste ground  near the Báb el Medina, and on the southern extremity. Having traversed  this open space in coming from the gate, you enter the suburbs,  comprising only huts formed of reeds, rushes, and brushwood, and  encircling the inner town, which consists of stone buildings. The huts  are chiefly inhabited by Bedouins, or poor peasants and labourers, who  live here completely after the Bedouin fashion. Similar quarters for  people of this description may be found in every town of Arabia. The  interior of Djidda is divided into different districts. The people of  Sowakin, who frequent this place, reside near the Báb el Medina; their  quarters are called Haret è Sowakiny. Here they live in a few poor  houses, but principally under huts, to which the lowest class of people  frequently resort, as many public women reside here, and those who sell  the intoxicating beverage called Boosa. The most respectable inhabitants  have their quarters near the sea, where a long street, running parallel  to the shore, appears lined with shops, and affords many khans  constantly and exclusively frequented by the merchants. Djidda is well  built; indeed, better than any Turkish town of equal size that I had  hitherto seen. The streets are unpaved, but spacious and airy; the  houses high, constructed wholly of stone, brought for the greater part  from the sea-shore, and consisting of madrepores and other marine    [p.10] fossils. Almost every house has two stories, with many small  windows and wooden shutters. Some have bow-windows, which exhibit a  great display of joiners or carpenters work. There is, generally, a  spacious hall at the entrance, where strangers are received, and which,  during the heat of the day, is cooler than any other part of the house,  as its floor is kept almost constantly wet. The distribution of rooms is  nearly the same as in the houses of Egypt and Syria; with this  difference, however, that in Djidda there are not so many large and  lofty apartments as in those countries, where but few houses, at least  of the natives, have two stories, whilst the rooms on the ground-floor  are sometimes of a considerable height. It thus happens that, in many  houses of the Hedjaz, the only cool spot is the entrance-hall; and here,  at noon, the master, with all his male attendants, hired servants or  slaves, may be seen enjoying, the siesta. [Although the cool breeze comes  only from the north, yet the Arabians do not seem to take so much  advantage of it in their houses as the Egyptians, whose principal rooms  are generally so contrived as to open towards the north. The large  ventilators constructed on the terraces of houses in Egypt, and which  diffuse a current of air through all the lower apartments, are unknown  in the Hedjaz.] As building is very expensive in this country, little is  adapted for outward show beyond the lattice-work of the bow-windows;  this frequently is painted with most gaudy colours, both on the outside  and inside. In many houses the lawful wife of a man occupies one part,  and his female Abyssinian slaves are lodged in their own distinct  apartments; convenience, therefore, in the building, is more studied  than size or beauty; yet, in Egypt, many ordinary houses have spacious  and handsome rooms.    Uniformity in architecture is not observed at Djidda. Some houses are  built with small, others with large square stones, the smooth side  outwards, and the interior filled up with mud. Sometimes the walls are  entirely of stone; many have, at intervals of about three feet, thin  layers of planks placed in the wall, and these, the    [p.11] Arabs imagine, tend to increase its strength. When the walls are  plastered, the wood is left of its natural colour, which gives to the  whole a gay and pleasing appearance, as if the building had been  ornamented with so many bands; but the dazzling white of the walls  during sun-shine is extremely distressing to the eyes. Most of the  gateways have pointed arches; some few round; and the latter are seen,  though less frequently, over the gates of private houses in every part  of Egypt. No buildings of ancient date are observed in Djidda, the  madrepore being of such a nature that it rapidly decays when exposed to  the rain and moist atmosphere prevalent here. [In general, it may be said  that Djidda is a modern town; for its importance as a market of Indian  goods can only be traced to the beginning of "]]]
