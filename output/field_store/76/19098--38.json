[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11242"],[0,"The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti (#5)"],[1," not attract much attention. Vasari praises it for grace and  composition above the scope of Donatello; and certainly we may trace  here the first germ of that sweet and winning majesty which Buonarroti  was destined to develop in his Pieta of S. Peter, the Madonna at  Bruges, and the even more glorious Madonna of S. Lorenzo. It is also  interesting for the realistic introduction of a Tuscan cottage  staircase into the background. This bas-relief was presented to Cosimo  de' Medici, first Grand Duke of Tuscany, by Michelangelo's nephew  Lionardo. It afterwards came back into the possession of the  Buonarroti family, and forms at present an ornament of their house at  Florence.      VII    We are accustomed to think of Michelangelo as a self-withdrawn and  solitary worker, living for his art, avoiding the conflict of society,  immersed in sublime imaginings. On the whole, this is a correct  conception of the man. Many passages of his biography will show how  little he actively shared the passions and contentions of the stirring  times through which he moved. Yet his temperament exposed him to  sudden outbursts of scorn and anger, which brought him now and then  into violent collision with his neighbours. An incident of this sort  happened while he was studying under the patronage of Lorenzo de'  Medici, and its consequences marked him physically for life. The young  artists whom the Magnificent gathered round him used to practise  drawing in the Brancacci Chapel of the Carmine. There Masaccio and his  followers bequeathed to us noble examples of the grand style upon the  frescoed panels of the chapel walls. It was the custom of industrious  lads to make transcripts from those broad designs, some of which  Raphael deigned in his latest years to repeat, with altered manner,  for the Stanze of the Vatican and the Cartoons. Michelangelo went one  day into the Carmine with Piero Torrigiano and other comrades. What  ensued may best be reported in the narration which Torrigiano at a  later time made to Benvenuto Cellini.    \"This Buonarroti and I used, when we were boys, to go into the Church  of the Carmine to learn drawing from the chapel of Masaccio. It was  Buonarroti's habit to banter all who were drawing there; and one day,  when he was annoying me, I got more angry than usual, and, clenching  my fist, I gave him such a blow on the nose that I felt bone and  cartilage go down like biscuit beneath my knuckles; and this mark of  mine he will carry with him to the grave.\" The portraits of  Michelangelo prove that Torrigiano's boast was not a vain one. They  show a nose broken in the bridge. But Torrigiano, for this act of  violence, came to be regarded by the youth of Florence with aversion,  as one who had laid sacrilegious hands upon the sacred ark. Cellini  himself would have wiped out the insult with blood. Still Cellini knew  that personal violence was not in the line of Michelangelo's  character; for Michelangelo, according to his friend and best  biographer, Condivi, was by nature, \"as is usual with men of sedentary  and contemplative habits, rather timorous than otherwise, except when  he is roused by righteous anger to resent unjust injuries or wrongs  done to himself or others, in which case he plucks up more spirit than  those who are esteemed brave; but, for the rest, he is most patient  and enduring.\" Cellini, then, knowing the quality of Michelangelo's  temper, and respecting him as a deity of art, adds to his report of  Torrigiano's conversation: \"These words begat in me such hatred of the  man, since I was always gazing at the masterpieces of the divine  Michelangelo, that, although I felt a wish to go with him to England,  I now could never bear the sight of him.\"      VIII    The years Michelangelo spent in the Casa Medici were probably the  blithest and most joyous of his lifetime. The men of wit and learning  who surrounded the Magnificent were not remarkable for piety or moral  austerity. Lorenzo himself found it politically useful \"to occupy the  Florentines with shows and festivals, in order that they might think  of their own pastimes and not of his designs, and, growing unused to  the conduct of the commonwealth, might leave the reins of government  in his hands.\" Accordingly he devised those Carnival triumphs and  processions which filled the sombre streets of Florence with  Bacchanalian revellers, and the ears of her grave citizens with  ill-disguised obscenity. Lorenzo took part in them himself, and  composed several choruses of high literary merit to be sung by the  masqueraders. One of these carries a refrain which might be chosen as  a motto for the spirit of that age upon the brink of ruin:--      _Youths and maids, enjoy to-day:    Naught ye know about to-morrow!_    He caused the triumphs to be carefully prepared by the best artists,  the dresses of the masquers to be accurately studied, and their  chariots to be adorned with illustrative paintings. Michelangelo's old  friend Granacci dedicated his talents to these shows, which also  employed the wayward fancy of Piero di Cosimo and Pontormo's power as  a colourist. \"It was their wont,\" says Il Lasca, \"to go forth after  dinner; and often the processions paraded through the streets till  three or four hours into the night, with a multitude of masked men on  horseback following, richly dressed, exceeding sometimes three hundred  in number, and as many on foot with lighted torches. Thus they  traversed the city, singing to the accompaniment of music arranged for  four, eight, twelve, or even fifteen voices, and supported by various  instruments.\" Lorenzo represented the worst as well as the best  qualities of his age. If he knew how to enslave Florence, it was  because his own temperament inclined him to share the amusements of  the crowd, while his genius enabled him to invest corruption with  charm. His friend Poliziano entered with the zest of a poet and a  pleasure-seeker into these diversions. He helped Lorenzo to revive the  Tuscan Mayday games, and wrote exquisite lyrics to be sung by girls in  summer evenings on the public squares. This giant of learning, who  filled the lecture-rooms of Florence with Students of all nations, and  whose critical and rhetorical labours marked an epoch in the history  of scholarship, was by nature a versifier, and a versifier of the  people. He found nothing' easier than to throw aside his professor's  mantle and to improvise _ballate_ for women to chant as they danced  their rounds upon the Piazza di S. Trinita. The frontispiece to an old  edition of such lyrics represents Lorenzo surrounded with masquers in  quaint dresses, leading the revel beneath the walls of the Palazzo.  Another woodcut shows an angle of the Casa Medici in Via Larga, girls  dancing the _carola_ upon the street below, one with a wreath and  thyrsus kneeling, another presenting the Magnificent with a book of  loveditties. The burden of all this poetry was: \"Gather ye roses while  ye may, cast prudence to the winds, obey your instincts.\" There is  little doubt that Michelangelo took part in these pastimes; for we  know that he was devoted to poetry, not always of the gravest kind. An  anecdote related by Cellini may here be introduced, since it  illustrates the Florentine customs I have been describing. \"Luigi  Pulci was a young man who possessed extraordinary gifts for poetry,  together with sound Latin scholarship. He wrote well, was graceful in  manners, and of surpassing personal beauty. While he was yet a lad and  living in Florence, it was the habit of folk in certain places of the  city to meet together during the nights of summer on the open streets,  and he, ranking among the best of the improvisatori, sang there. His  recitations were so admirable that the divine Michelangelo, that  prince of sculptors and of painters, went, wherever he heard that he  would be, with the greatest eagerness and delight to listen to him.  There was a man called Piloto, a goldsmith, very able in his art, who,  together with myself, joined Buonarroti upon these occasions.\" In like  manner, the young Michelangelo probably attended those nocturnal  gatherings upon the steps of the Duomo which have been so graphically  described by Doni: \"The Florentines seem to me to take more pleasure  in summer airings than any other folk; for they have, in the square of  S. Liberata, between the antique temple of Mars, now the Baptistery,  and that marvellous work of modern architecture, the Duomo: they have,  I say, certain steps of marble, rising to a broad flat space, upon  which the youth of the city come and lay themselves full length during  the season of extreme heat. The place is fitted for its purpose,  because a fresh breeze is always blowing, with the blandest of all  air, and the flags of white marble usually retain a certain coolness.  There then I seek my chiefest solace, when, taking my aerial flights,  I sail invisibly above them; see and hear their doings and discourses:  and forasmuch as they are endowed with keen and elevated  understanding, they always have a thousand charming things to relate;  as novels, intrigues, fables; they discuss duels, practical jokes, old  stories, tricks played off by men and women on each other: things,  each and all, rare, witty, noble, decent and in proper taste. I can  swear that during all the hours I spent in listening to their nightly  dialogues, I never heard a word that was not comely and of good  repute. Indeed, it seemed to me very remarkable, among such crowds of  young men, to overhear nothing but virtuous conversation.\"    At the same period, Michelangelo fell under very different influences;  and these left a far more lasting impression on his character than the  gay festivals and witty word-combats of the lords of Florence. In 1491  Savonarola, the terrible prophet of coming woes, the searcher of men's  hearts, and the remorseless denouncer of pleasant vices, began that  Florentine"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11246"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 14, No. 394, (#5)"],[1," from slopes and lawns of tender green, which take their  rise in the low stream-watered valleys, and extend up the steep ascent  till met midway by the lofty chestnut groves which pale them in. To  these gentler features succeeds the passage of the Apennines, which  here, at least, are not as the author of \"Italy as it Is,\" describes  them, \"the children of the Alps--smiling and gentle and happy as  children should be,\" but, as we remember them, their summits form  themselves into a wild, dreary region, sown with sterile mountain-tops,  and torn to pieces by wind and storm; the only glimpse of peace is  derived from the view on either side of the sea, which sometimes shows  itself on the horizon, a misty line, half silver, half ether. This  barren wilderness again softens into gracefully-swelling hills turned  towards Florence. The fair olive tree and the dark cypress mingle their  foliage with the luxuriant chestnut boughs, and the frequent marble  villa flashes a white gleam from amid its surrounding laurel bowers. The  sky is more beautiful than earth, and each symbolize peace and serene  enjoyment.--_Westminster Review._           *       *       *       *       *      MUSICAL MARVEL.      One of the most amusing stories in ancient history, of the successful  and happy use of fine music, is told of Arion, who, when about to be  thrown overboard by some mutinous sailors, begged leave to sing to his  lute one funeral strain before his death. Having obtained leave, he  stood upon the prow with his instrument, chanted with a loud voice his  sweetest elegy, and then threw himself into the sea. A dolphin, as the  story goes, charmed with his music, swam to him while floating on the  waves, bore him on his back, and carried him safely to Cape Taenarus, in  Sparta, from whence he went to Corinth. It would have been well for the  mutineers if their taste for music had been as great as the dolphin's,  for the history not only affords a grand instance of the power of music,  but of retributive justice, as the sailors accidentally going to  Corinth, paid the penalty of their evil intentions with their lives.           *       *       *       *       *      POPULATION OF AUSTRALIA.      Mr. Martin mentions a very curious fact. The increase of population, he  says, has been most rapid, and is to be accounted for by the number of  females born, the proportion being, with regard to males, as three to  one! The great preponderating number of females brought forth among  domesticated animals, will account for the countless herds of cattle  which overspread the colony.--_New Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.             *       *       *       *       *      THE BLACK LADY OF ALTENOeTTING.      With the exception of the shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne, there  exists throughout Germany no spot of greater sanctity, no altar of  richer endowments, than the Chapel of the Black Lady, on the frontier of  Bavaria. The hearts of its sovereign electors have been deposited, from  century to century, within the consecrated cells; nor is there an  historic event, involving the interests of their own, or the adjacent  kingdoms, which is not supposed to have been influenced by her potent  interposition. A sufficient history, in fact, of the destinies of the  whole empire, might be recorded in a mere catalogue of the national  offerings to the shrine of Altenoetting.    In rambling through the eastern provinces of Bavaria, some few springs  ago, I chanced to arrive one glowing afternoon at the post-house of an  inconsiderable town; which, from the grass-grown tranquillity of its  streets, and from a peculiar air of self-oblivion, appeared to be  basking fast asleep in the sunshine. There was little to admire in the  common-place character of its site, or the narrow meanness of its  distribution; yet there was something peculiar in its look of dreamy  non-identity; and had it not been for the smiling faces of the  fair-haired Bavarian girls, who were to be seen glancing here and there,  with their embroidered purple bodices and coifs, and silver-chained  stomachers, I could believe myself to have reached some enchanted realm  of forgetfulness.    As I entered the Platz, or market-square, of the little town, chiefly  with a view to the nearer inspection of the cunning workmanship of the  aforesaid carcanets of silver, a light sprinkling of April rain began to  moisten the pavement--one of those unheard, unseen, revivifying showers,  which weep the earth into freshness, and the buds into maturity. I was  anxious, however, to withdraw my mere human nature from participation in  these herbaceous advantages; and looking about for some shelter which  might preserve me from the mischiefs of the shower, without depriving me  of its refreshing fragrance, I espied in the centre of the Platz--a  square of no mighty area--a low, rotunda-like building, with slated  roof, overhanging and resting upon wooden pillars, so as to form a sort  of covered walk.    I settled with myself that this was the market-house of the town, and  hastened to besiege so desirable a city of refuge. But during my rapid  approach, I observed that the external walls of the nameless edifice  beneath the arcade were covered, and without a single interstitial  interval, by small pictures in oil-colours, equal in size, and equal in  demerit, and each and all representing some calamitous crisis of human  existence--a fire, a ship-wreck, a boat-wreck, a battle, a leprosy! It  occurred to me at the same moment, that this gallery of mortal  casualties and afflictions must be a collection of votive offerings, and  that the seeming market-house was, probably, a shrine of especial  sanctity. And so it was!--the shrine of \"The Black Lady of Altenoetting.\"    Instigated by somewhat more than a traveller's vague curiosity, I  entered the chapel; the brilliancy of which, eternally illuminated by  the reflection of a profusion of silver lamps upon the thousand precious  objects which decorate the walls, forms a startling contrast with the  dim shadows of the external arcade. In most cases, the entrance to a  religious edifice impresses the mind with a consciousness of vastness,  and a sensation of awe:--      \"------the tombs    And monumental caves of death look cold,    And strike an aching dullness to the breast.\"    But the chapel of the Black Virgin is diminutive as a boudoir, and yet  retains the usual character of listening and awful stillness, the  ordinary impression of local sanctity. A few peasants were seen kneeling  in utter immobility and self-abstraction beneath a lamp, which seemed to  issue in a crimson flame from a colossal two-fold silver heart,  suspended from the ceiling--their untutored minds were elevated into the  belief of a heavenly commune.    In a glass case above the altar, is deposited this far-famed effigy of  the Holy Galilean virgin--a hideous female negro, carved in wood, and  holding an infant Jesus in her arms of the same hue and material; and  exhibited in its extremity of ugliness by the reflected glare of the  silver and diamonds, and gems of every description, by which she is  surrounded. Chests, mimic altars, models of ships, crowns and sceptres,  chalices and crosses of gold and silver and enamel, and enriched with      Turkish blue and emerald green,    and every jewel of every land, lie amassed in gorgeous profusion in the  adjoining cases, and seemed to realize the fabled treasures of the  preadamite Sultans. Boasting themselves as gifts of gratitude or  invocation from emperors and popes, kings, princes, palsgraves, and all  the other minor thrones and dominions of the earth, these splendid  offerings form the most plausible illustration of the miraculous power  attributed to the image of the Black Lady, which has been deposited in  its actual abode since the year of Grace 696. In the course of the  Thirty Years' War, this important relic and its treasury were twice  removed into the city of Salzburg, for security from the Swedish  invaders; and twice brought back in solemn triumph to their ancient  sanctuary.    But a mightier charm than that of gems or metals, the most precious or  the most beautiful, connects itself with the chapel of Altenoetting--its  association with historical names of all ages, from Charlemagne and Otto  of Wittelsbach, whose monuments we find inscribed in Runic characters,  to Pius the Sixth, whose dedication, \"O clemens, O pia Virgo  Oettingana!\" is graven in a \"fine Roman hand.\" It contains sepulchral  vaults of the families of Wallenstein, Tilly, Montecuculi, besides those  of divers electors, archbishops, and archdukes, whose titles speak far  less stirringly to the heart; altogether forming an illustration of the  past, which brings the dark ages in living majesty before our eyes.    Alternately dazzled and disgusted by this fruitless waste of splendour,  this still more fruitless waste of national credulity, I was pondering  over the domestic virtues of a certain \"Franziska Barbara, Countess of  Tilly,\" as recorded over her grave, when the chants of the priests, who  had been engaged in the celebration of mass before the altar, suddenly  ceased; and, as the last fumes of the incense circled upwards to the  blackened roof, there arose another and a solitary voice, evidently of  lay intonation, and deepened by that persuasive earnestness of devotion  which, like an electric chain, connects in holy feeling all sects of the  Christian church. It spoke in the fulness of gratitude, and in the  humbleness of prayer; and although the dialect was tinged with village  barbarism, and its thankfulness addressed to the Black Virgin, I heard  in its simple solemnity only the beauty of holiness; and, overlooking  the visible shrine, beheld in its ultimate object the tribunal of divine  mercy!
