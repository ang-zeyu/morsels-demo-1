I'll take good care of it for you.  Now make haste to church.\"    All during the service the children kept glancing across at Farmer  Landfried's wife, and when they came out they waited for her at the  door; but the wealthy farmer's wife was surrounded by so many people,  all eagerly talking to her, that she was obliged to keep turning in a  circle to answer first one and then another. She had no opportunity to  notice the wistful glances of the children and their continual nodding.  Dame Landfried had Rosie, Farmer Rodel's youngest daughter, in her hand.  Rosie was a year older than Amrei, who involuntarily kept moving her  hand, as though she would have pushed aside the intruder who was taking  her place. Had the well-to-do farmer's wife eyes for Amrei only out by  the last house, and when they were alone, and did she not know her when  other people were present? Are only the children of rich people noticed  then, and the children of relatives?    Amrei was startled when she suddenly heard this thought, which had begun  to stir gently within her, uttered aloud; it was Damie who uttered it.  And while she followed at a distance the large group of people  surrounding the farmer's wife, she strove to drive the bad thought out  of her brother's mind, as well as out of her own. Dame Landfried at last  disappeared into Farmer Rodel's house, and the children quietly turned  back.    Suddenly Damie said:    \"If she comes to you, you must tell her to go to Crappy Zachy too, and  tell him to be good to me.\"    Amrei nodded; and then the children parted, and went to the separate  houses where they had found shelter.    The clouds, which had lifted in the morning, came back in the afternoon  in the shape of a perfect downpour of rain. Dame Landfried's large red  umbrella was seen here and there around the village, almost hiding the  figure beneath it. Black Marianne had not been able to find her, and she  said on her return home:    \"She can come to me--I don't want anything of her.\"    The two children wandered out to their parents' house again and crouched  down on the door-step, hardly speaking a word. Again the suspicion  seemed to dawn upon them, that after all their parents would not come  back. Then Damie tried to count the drops of rain that fell from the  eaves; but they came down too quickly for him, and he made easy work of  it by crying out all at once: \"A thousand million!\"    \"She must come past here when she goes home,\" said Amrei, \"and then  we'll call out to her. Mind that you help me call, too, and then we'll  have another talk with her.\"    So said Amrei; for the children were still waiting there for Dame  Landfried.    The cracking of a whip sounded in the village. There was a trampling and  splashing of horses' feet in the slushy street, and a carriage came  rolling along.    \"You shall see that it's father and mother coming in a coach to fetch  us,\" cried Damie.    Amrei looked around at her brother mournfully, and said:    \"Don't chatter so.\"    When she looked back again the carriage was quite near; somebody in it  motioned from beneath a red umbrella, and away rolled the vehicle. Only  Coaly Mathew's dog barked after it for a while, and acted as if he  wanted to seize the spokes with his teeth; but at the pond he turned  back again, barked once more in front of the door, and then slunk into  the house.    \"Hurrah! she's gone away!\" cried Damie, as if he were glad of it. \"It  was Farmer Landfried's wife. Didn't you know Farmer Rodel's black  horses?--they carried her off. Don't forget my leather breeches!\" he  cried at the top of his voice, although the carriage had already  disappeared in the valley, and was presently seen creeping up the little  hill by the Holderwasen.    The children returned quietly to the village. Who knows in what way this  incident may take root in the inmost being, and what may sprout from it?  For the present another feeling covers that of the first, bitter  disappointment.          CHAPTER III    FROM THE TREE BY THE PARENTS' HOUSE      On the eve of All Souls' Day Black Marianne said to the children:    \"Go, now, and gather some red berries, for we shall want them at the  graveyard tomorrow.\"    \"I know where to find them! I can get some!\" cried Damie with genuine  eagerness and joy. And away he ran out of the village, at such a pace  that Amrei could hardly keep up with him; and when she arrived at their  parents' house he was already up in the tree, teasing her in a boasting  manner and calling for her to come up too--because he knew that she  could not. And now he began to pluck the red berries and threw them down  into his sister's apron. She asked him to pick them with their stems on,  because she wanted to make a wreath. He answered, \"No, I  shan't!\"--nevertheless no berries fell down after that without stems on  them.    \"Hark, how the sparrows are scolding!\" cried Damie from the tree.  \"They're angry because I'm taking their food away from them!\" And  finally, when he had plucked all the berries, he said: \"I shan't come  down again, but shall stay up here day and night until I die and drop  down, and shall never come to you at all any more, unless you promise me  something!\"    \"What is it?\"    \"That you'll never wear the necklace that Farmer Landfried's wife gave  you, so long as I can see it. Will you promise me that?\"    \"No!\"    \"Then I shall never come down!\"    \"Very well,\" said Amrei, and she went away with her berries. But before  she had gone far, she sat down behind a pile of wood and started to make  a wreath, every now and then peeping out to see if Damie was not coming.  She put the wreath on her head. Suddenly an indescribable anxiety about  Damie seized her; she ran back, and there was Damie, sitting astride a  branch and leaning back against the trunk of the tree with his arms  folded.    \"Come down! I'll promise you what you want!\" cried Amrei; and in a  moment Damie was down on the ground beside her.    When she got home, Black Marianne called her a foolish child and scolded  her for making a wreath for herself out of the berries that were  intended for her parents' graves. Marianne quickly destroyed the wreath,  muttering a few words which the children could not understand. Then she  took them both by the hand and led them out to the churchyard; and  passing where two mounds lay close together, she said:    \"There are your parents!\"    The children looked at each other in surprise. Marianne then made a  cross-shaped furrow in each of the mounds, and showed the children how  to stick the berries in. Damie was handy at the work, and boasted  because his red cross was finished sooner than his sister's. Amrei  looked at him fixedly and made no answer; but when Damie said, \"That  will please father,\" she struck him on the back and said: \"Be quiet!\"    Damie began to cry, perhaps louder than he really meant to. Then Amrei  called out:    \"For heaven's sake, forgive me!--forgive me for doing that to you. Right  here, I promise you that I'll do all I can for you, all my life long,  and give you everything I have. I didn't hurt you, Damie, did I? You may  depend upon it, it shall not happen again as long as I live--never  again!--never! Oh, mother! Oh, father! I shall be good, I promise you!  Oh, mother! Oh, father!\"    She could say no more; but she did not weep aloud, although it was plain  that her heart was almost bursting. Not until Black Marianne burst out  crying did Amrei weep with her.    They returned home, and when Damie said \"Good night,\" Amrei whispered  into his ear:    \"Now I know that we shall never see our parents again in this world.\"    Even from making this communication she derived a certain  satisfaction--a childish pride which is awakened by having something to  impart. And yet in this child's heart there had dawned something like a  realization that one of the great ties in her life had been severed  forever, the thought that arises with the consciousness that a parent is  no longer with us.    When the lips which called thee child have been sealed by death, a  breath has vanished from thy life that shall nevermore return.    While Black Marianne was sitting beside the child's bed, the little one  said:    \"I seem to be falling and falling, on and on. Let me keep hold of your  hand.\"    Holding the hand fast, she dropped into a slumber; but as often as Black  Marianne tried to draw her hand away, she clutched at it again. Marianne  understood what this sensation of endless falling signified for the  child; she felt in realizing her parents' death as if she were being  wafted along, without knowing whence or whither.    It was not until nearly midnight that Marianne was able to quit the  child's bedside, after she had repeated her usual twelve Paternosters  over and over again, who knows how many times? A look of stern defiance  was on the face of the sleeping child. She had laid one hand across her  bosom; Black Marianne gently lifted it, and said, half-aloud, to  herself:    \"If there were only an eye to watch over thee and a hand to help thee  all the time, as there is now in thy sleep, and to take the heaviness  out of thy heart without thy knowing it! But nobody can do that--none  but He alone. Oh, may He do unto my child in distant lands as I do unto  this little one!\"    Black Marianne was a shunned woman, that is to say, people were almost  afraid of her, so harsh did she seem in her manner. Some eighteen years  before she had lost her husband, who had been shot in an attempt which  he had made with some companions to rob the stage-coach. Marianne was  expecting a child to be born when the body of her husband, with its  blackened face, was carried into the village; but she bore up bravely  and washed the dead man's face as if she hoped, by so doing, to wash  away his black guilt. Her three daughters died, and only the son, who  was born soon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12574"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

This is the case with my _great_ mind,  (laughing anew,) and you must allow the simile is worthy the subject.  Jesting apart, I do like a little scandal--I believe all English people do.  An Italian lady, Madame Benzoni, talking to me on the prevalence of this  taste among my compatriots, observed, that when she first knew the English,  she thought them the most spiteful and ill-natured people in the world,  from hearing them constantly repeating evil of each other; but having seen  various amiable traits in their characters, she had arrived at the  conclusion, that they were not naturally _mechant_; but that living in a  country like England, where severity of morals punishes so heavily any  dereliction from propriety, each individual, to prove personal correctness,  was compelled to attack the _sins_ of his or her acquaintance, as it  furnished an opportunity of expressing their abhorrence by words, instead  of proving it by actions, which might cause some self-denial to themselves.  This,\" said Byron, \"was an ingenious, as well as charitable supposition;  and we must all allow that it is infinitely more easy to decry and expose  the sins of others, than to correct our own; and many find the first so  agreeable an occupation, that it precludes the second--this, at least, is  my case.\"    \"The Italians do not understand the English,\" said Byron; \"indeed, how can  they? for they (the Italians) are frank, simple, and open in their natures,  following the bent of their inclinations, which they do not believe to be  wicked; while the English, to conceal the indulgence of theirs, daily  practise hypocrisy, falsehood, and uncharitableness; so that to _one_  error is added many crimes.\" Byron had now got on a favourite subject, and  went on decrying hypocrisy and cant, mingling sarcasms and bitter  observations on the false delicacy of the English. It is strange, but true  as strange, that he could not, or at least did not, distinguish the  distinction between cause and effect, in this case. The respect for virtue  will always cause spurious imitations of it to be given; and what he calls  hypocrisy, is but the respect to public opinion that induces people, who  have not courage to correct their errors, at least to endeavour to conceal  them; and Cant is the homage that Vice pays to Virtue.[1] We do not value  the diamond less, because there are so many worthless imitations of it,  and Goodness loses nothing of her intrinsic value because so many wish to  be thought to possess it. That nation may be considered to possess the  most virtue, where it is the most highly appreciated; and that the least,  where it is so little understood, that the semblance is not even assumed.    Byron is, I believe, sincere in his belief in supernatural appearances; he  assumes a grave and mysterious air when he talks on the subject, which he  is fond of doing, and has told me some extraordinary stories relative to  Mr. Shelley, who, he assures me, had an implicit belief in ghosts. He also  told me that Mr. Shelley's spectre had appeared to a lady, walking in a  garden, and he seemed to lay great stress on this. Though some of the  wisest of mankind, as witness Johnson, shared this weakness in common with  Byron; still there is something so unusual in our matter-of-fact days in  giving way to it, that I was at first doubtful that Byron was serious in  his belief. He is also superstitious about days, and other trifling  things,--believes in lucky and unlucky days,--dislikes undertaking any  thing on a Friday, helping or being helped to salt at table, spilling salt  or oil, letting bread fall, and breaking mirrors; in short, he gives way  to a thousand fantastical notions, that prove that even _l'esprit le plus  fort_ has its weak side.

ADVICE, BY A MAN OF THE WORLD.    [We quoted _Contarini Fleming_ in our last volume, but were silent on its  character. It is purely metaphysical, and metaphysics, at this season, may  be \"like pork in the dog-days;\" but there are certain portions which  strike out ideas so forcibly, and illustrate the _communia_ of life with  such vigour, as to tempt any lounging reader. Contarini is stated to be Mr.  D'Israeli, the younger--Vivian Grey and the Young Duke,--with much more of  the crust and wing of age and experience than was found in either of the  fashionable novels. The real charm of Contarini is in its abstractedness,  and consists in being pleased and puzzled at the same moment. The  embellishment which the playful genius of the writer has gracefully, not  tawdrily, thrown over his pages will attract, but the main purpose and  merit of the work lies in its undercurrents, or, rather it would consist  in this feature if the judgment of the writer were still more matured.  Perhaps Mr. D'Israeli, who began the world of letters as a writer of  fashionable novels, may leave us a work on metaphysics.    In the opening chapter of Contarini Fleming, Mr. D'Israeli explains his  object as follows:--]    I am desirous of writing a book which shall be all truth, a work of which  the passion, the thought, the action, and even the style, should spring  from my own experience of feeling, from the meditations of my own  intellect, from my own observation of incident, from my own study of the  genius of expression.    [We can only admit a passage which appears to us to contain much  world-knowledge and wholesome experience--what half the coroneted heads in  Europe lack most lamentably. It is the advice tendered to Contarini by his  father, previous to the youth of promise repairing to the University:]    I wish you to mix as much as is convenient with society. I apprehend that  you have, perhaps, hitherto indulged a little too much in lonely habits.  Young men are apt to get a little abstracted, and occasionally to think  that there is something singular in their nature, when the fact is, if  they were better acquainted with their fellow creatures, they would find  they were mistaken. This is a common error, indeed the commonest. I am not  at all surprised that you have fallen into it. All have. The most  practical business-like men that exist have many of them, when children,  conceived themselves totally disqualified to struggle in the world. You  may rest assured of this. I could mention many remarkable instances. All  persons, when young, are fond of solitude, and, when they are beginning to  think, are sometimes surprised at their own thoughts. There is nothing to  be deplored, scarcely to be feared, in this. It almost always wears off;  but sometimes it happens, that they have not judicious friends by them to  explain, that the habits which they think peculiar are universal, and, if  unreasonably indulged, can ultimately only turn them into indolent,  insignificant members of society, and occasion them lasting unhappiness.    But to enter society with pleasure, you must be qualified for it. I think  it quite time for you to make yourself master of some accomplishments.  Decidedly you should make yourself a good dancer. Without dancing, you can  never attain a perfectly graceful carriage, which is of"]]]
