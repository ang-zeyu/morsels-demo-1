In 1606 the  Virginia Company was formed and colonization began on a large scale.    [Sidenote: The Virginia colonists at Jamestown, 1607. _Higginson_,  52, 110-117; _Eggleston_, 19-28; _Explorers_ 231-269.]    [Sidenote: Sickness and death.]    32. Founding of Jamestown, 1607. The first colonists sailed for  Virginia in December, 1606. They were months on the way and suffered  terrible hardships. At last they reached Chesapeake Bay and James River  and settled on a peninsula on the James, about thirty miles from its  mouth. Across the little isthmus which connected this peninsula with the  mainland they built a strong fence, or stockade, to keep the Indians  away from their huts. Their settlement they named Jamestown. The early  colonists of Virginia were not very well fitted for such a work. Some of  them were gentlemen who had never labored with their hands; others were  poor, idle fellows whose only wish was to do nothing whatever. There  were a few energetic men among them as Ratcliffe, Archer, and Smith. But  these spent most of their time in exploring the bay and the rivers, in  hunting for gold, and in quarreling with one another. With the summer  came fevers, and soon fifty of the one hundred and five original  colonists were dead. Then followed a cold, hard winter, and many of  those who had not died of fever in the summer, now died of cold. The  colonists brought little food with them, they were too lazy to plant  much corn, and they were able to get only small supplies from the  Indians. Indeed, the early history of Virginia is given mainly to  accounts of \"starving times.\" Of the first thousand colonists not one  hundred lived to tell the tale of those early days.    [Sidenote: Sir Thomas Dale.]    [Sidenote: His wise action.]    33. Sir Thomas Dale and Good Order.--In 1611 Sir Thomas Dale came  out as ruler, and he ruled with an iron hand. If a man refused to work,  Dale made a slave of him for three years; if he did not work hard  enough, Dale had him soundly whipped. But Sir Thomas Dale was not only a  severe man; he was also a wise man. Hitherto everything had been in  common. Dale now tried the experiment of giving three acres of land to  every one of the old planters, and he also allowed them time to work on  their own land.    [Sidenote: Tobacco.]    [Sidenote: Prosperity.]    34. Tobacco-growing and Prosperity.--European people were now  beginning to use tobacco. Most of it came from the Spanish colonies.  Tobacco grew wild in Virginia. But the colonists at first did not know  how to dry it and make it fit for smoking. After a few years they found  out how to prepare it. They now worked with great eagerness and planted  tobacco on every spot of cleared land. Men with money came over from  England. They brought many workingmen with them and planted large pieces  of ground. Soon tobacco became the money of the colony, and the whole  life of Virginia turned on its cultivation. But it was difficult to find  enough laborers to do the necessary work.    [Sidenote: White servants.]    [Sidenote: Criminals.]    [Sidenote: Negro slaves, 1619.]    35. Servants and Slaves.--Most of the laborers were white men and  women who were bound to service for terms of years. These were called  servants. Some of them were poor persons who sold their labor to pay for  their passage to Virginia. Others were unfortunate men and women and  even children who were stolen from their families and sold to the  colonists. Still others were criminals whom King James sent over to the  colony because that was the cheapest thing to do with them. In 1619 the  first negro slaves were brought to Virginia by a Dutch vessel. The  Virginians bought them all--only twenty in number. But the planters  preferred white laborers. It was not until more that twenty-five years  had passed away that the slaves really became numerous enough to make  much difference in the life of the colony.    [Sidenote: Sir Edwin Sandys.]    [Sidenote: The first American legislature, 1619.]    36. The first American Legislature, 1619.--The men who first formed  the Virginia Company had long since lost interest in it. Other men had  taken their places. These latter were mostly Puritans (p. 29) or were  the friends and workers with the Puritans. The best known of them was  Sir Edwin Sandys, the playmate of William Brewster--one of the Pilgrim  Fathers (p. 29). Sandys and his friends sent Sir George Yeardley to  Virginia as governor. They ordered him to summon an assembly to be made  up of representatives chosen by the freemen of the colony. These  representatives soon did away with Dale's ferocious regulations, and  made other and much milder laws.    [Sidenote: End of the Virginia Company, 1624.]    [Sidenote: Virginia a royal province.]    37. Virginia becomes a Royal Province, 1624.--The Virginians  thought this was a very good way to be governed. But King James thought  that the new rulers of the Virginia Company were much too liberal, and  he determined to destroy the company. The judges in those days dared not  displease the king for he could turn them out of office at any time. So  when he told them to destroy the Virginia charter they took the very  first opportunity to declare it to be of no force. In this way the  Virginia Company came to an end, and Virginia became a royal province  with a governor appointed by the king.    [Sidenote: Intolerance in Virginia.]    [Sidenote: Persecution of the Puritans.]    38. Religious Intolerance.--In 1625 King James died, and his son  Charles became king. He left the Virginians to themselves for the most  part. They liked this. But they did not like his giving the northern  part of Virginia to a Roman Catholic favorite, Lord Baltimore, with the  name of Maryland. Many Roman Catholics soon settled in Lord Baltimore's  colony. The Virginians feared lest they might come to Virginia and made  severe laws against them. Puritan missionaries also came from New  England and began to convert the Virginians to Puritanism. Governor  Berkeley and the leading Virginians were Episcopalians. They did not  like the Puritans any better than they liked the Roman Catholics. They  made harsh laws against them and drove them out of Virginia  into Maryland.    [Sidenote: Maryland given to Baltimore, 1632.]    [Sidenote: Settlement of Maryland. _Higginson_, 121-123; _Eggleston_,  50-53; _Source-book_, 48-51.]    39. Settlement of Maryland.--Maryland included the most valuable  portion of Virginia north of the Potomac. Beside being the owner of all  this land, Lord Baltimore was also the ruler of the colony. He invited  people to go over and settle in Maryland and offered to give them large  tracts of land on the payment of a small sum every year forever. Each  man's payment was small. But all the payments taken together, made quite  a large amount which went on growing larger and larger as Maryland was  settled. The Baltimores were broad-minded men. They gave their colonists  a large share in the government of the colony and did what they could to  bring about religious toleration in Maryland.    [Sidenote: Roman Catholics in England.]    [Sidenote: Roman Catholics and Puritans in Maryland.]    [Sidenote: The Toleration Act, 1649.]    40. The Maryland Toleration Act, 1649.--The English Roman Catholics  were cruelly oppressed. No priest of that faith was allowed to live in  England. And Roman Catholics who were not priests had to pay heavy fines  simply because they were Roman Catholics. Lord Baltimore hoped that his  fellow Catholics might find a place of shelter in Maryland, and many of  the leading colonists were Roman Catholics. But most of the laborers  were Protestants. Soon came the Puritans from Virginia. They were kindly  received and given land. But it was evident that it would be difficult  for Roman Catholics, Episcopalians, and Puritans to live together  without some kind of law to go by. So a law was made that any Christian  might worship as he saw fit. This was the first toleration act in the  history of America. It was the first toleration act in the history of  modern times. But the Puritan, Roger Williams, had already established  religious freedom in Rhode Island (p. 33).    [Sidenote: Tobacco and grain.]    [Sidenote: Commerce.]    [Sidenote: Servants and slaves.]    41. Maryland Industries.--Tobacco was the most important crop in  early Maryland. But grain was raised in many parts of the colony. In  time also there grew up a large trading town. This was Baltimore. Its  shipowners and merchants became rich and numerous, while there were  almost no shipowners or merchants in Virginia. There were also fewer  slaves in Maryland than in Virginia. Nearly all the hard labor in the  former colony was done by white servants. In most other ways, however,  Virginia and Maryland were nearly alike.          CHAPTER 6      NEW ENGLAND    [Sidenote: The English Puritans.]    [Sidenote: Non-Conformists.]    [Sidenote: Separatists.]    42. The Puritans.--The New England colonies were founded by English  Puritans who left England because they could not do as they wished in  the home land. All Puritans were agreed in wishing for a freer  government than they had in England under the Stuart kings and in state  matters were really the Liberals of their time. In religious matters,  however, they were not all of one mind. Some of them wished to make only  a few changes in the Church. These were called Non-Conformists. Others  wished to make so many changes in religion that they could not stay in  the English State Church. These were called Separatists. The settlers of  Plymouth were Separatists; the settlers of Boston and neighboring towns  were Non-Conformists.

Remember, however,  that only the lady of the house has the right to ask you. If others do  so, you can put them off in some polite way; but must not comply till  the hostess herself invites you.    Be scrupulous to observe silence when any of the company are playing  or singing. Remember that they are doing this for the amusement of the  rest; and that to talk at such a time is as ill-bred as if you were  to turn your back upon a person who was talking to you, and begin a  conversation with some one else.    If you are yourself the performer, bear in mind that in music, as in  speech, \"brevity is the soul of wit.\" Two verses of a song, or four  pages of a piece, are at all times enough to give pleasure. If your  audience desire more they will ask for more; and it is infinitely more  flattering to be encored than to receive the thanks of your hearers,  not so much in gratitude for what you have given them, but in relief  that you have left off. You should try to suit your music, like your  conversation, to your company. A solo of Beethoven's would be as much  out of place in some circles as a comic song at a quakers' meeting.  To those who only care for the light popularities of the season, give  Balfe and Verdi, Glover and Julien. To connoisseurs, if you perform  well enough to venture, give such music as will be likely to meet the  exigencies of a fine taste. Above all, attempt nothing that you cannot  execute with ease and precision.    If the party be of a small and social kind, and those games called by  the French _les jeux innocents_ are proposed, do not object to join in  them when invited. It maybe that they demand some slight exercise of  wit and readiness, and that you do not feel yourself calculated to  shine in them; but it is better to seem dull than disagreeable, and  those who are obliging can always find some clever neighbour to assist  them in the moment of need.    Impromptu charades are frequently organized at friendly parties.  Unless you have really some talent for acting and some readiness of  speech, you should remember that you only put others out and expose  your own inability by taking part in these entertainments. Of course,  if your help is really needed, and you would disoblige by refusing,  you must do your best, and by doing it as quietly and coolly as  possible, avoid being awkward or ridiculous.    Even though you may take no pleasure in cards, some knowledge of the  etiquette and rules belonging to the games most in vogue is necessary  to you in society. If a fourth hand is wanted at a rubber, or if the  rest of the company sit down to a round game, you would be deemed  guilty of an impoliteness if you refused to join.    The games most commonly played in society are whist, loo,  _vingt-et-un_, and speculation.    Whist requires four players.[A] A pack of cards being spread upon the  table with their faces downwards, the four players draw for partners.  Those who draw the two highest cards and those who draw the two lowest  become partners. The lowest of all claims the deal.    Married people should not play at the same table, unless where the  party is so small that it cannot be avoided. This rule supposes  nothing so disgraceful to any married couple as dishonest collusion;  but persons who play regularly together cannot fail to know so much  of each other's mode of acting, under given circumstances, that  the chances no longer remain perfectly even in favour of their  adversaries.    Never play for higher stakes than you can afford to lose without  regret. Cards should be resorted to for amusement only; for  excitement, never.    No well-bred person ever loses temper at the card-table. You have  no right to sit down to the game unless you can bear a long run of  ill-luck with perfect composure, and are prepared cheerfully to pass  over any blunders that your partner may chance to make.    If you are an indifferent player, make a point of saying so before  you join a party at whist. If the others are fine players they will  be infinitely more obliged to you for declining than accepting their  invitation. In any case you have no right to spoil their pleasure by  your bad play.    Never let even politeness induce you to play for very high stakes.  Etiquette is the minor morality of life; but it never should be  allowed to outweigh the higher code of right and wrong.    Young ladies may decline to play at cards without being deemed guilty  of impoliteness.    No very young lady should appear at an evening party without an  escort.    In retiring from a crowded party it is unnecessary that you should  seek out the hostess for the purpose of bidding her a formal  good-night. By doing this you would, perhaps, remind others that it  was getting late, and cause the party to break up. If you meet the  lady of the house on your way to the drawing-room door, take your  leave of her as unobtrusively as possible, and slip away without  attracting the attention of her other guests.

To be acquainted with every detail of the etiquette pertaining to  this subject is of the highest importance to every gentlewoman. Ease,  _savoir faire_, and good breeding are nowhere more indispensable than  at the dinner-table, and the absence of them is nowhere more apparent.  How to eat soup and what to do with a cherry-stone are weighty  considerations when taken as the index of social status; and it is not  too much to say, that a young woman who elected to take claret with  her fish, or ate peas with her knife, would justly risk the punishment  of being banished from good society. As this subject is one of the  most important of which we have to treat, we may be pardoned for  introducing an appropriate anecdote related by the French poet  Delille:--    Delille and Marmontel were dining together in the month of April,  1786, and the conversation happened to turn upon dinner-table customs.  Marmontel observed how many little things a well-bred man was obliged  to know, if he would avoid being ridiculous at the tables of his  friends.    \"They are, indeed, innumerable,\" said Delille; \"and the most annoying  fact of all is, that not all the wit and good sense in the world can  help one to divine them untaught. A little while ago, for instance,  the Abbe Cosson, who is Professor of Literature at the College  Mazarin, was describing to me a grand dinner to which he had been  invited at Versailles, and to which he had sat down in the company of  peers, princes, and marshals of France.    \"'I'll wager now,' said I, 'that you committed a hundred blunders in  the etiquette of the table!'    \"'How so?' replied the Abbe, somewhat nettled. 'What blunders could I  make? It seems to me that I did precisely as others did.'    \"'And I, on the contrary, would stake my life that you did nothing as  others did. But let us begin at the beginning, and see which is right.  In the first place there was your table napkin--what did you do with  that when you sat down at table?'    \"'What did I do with my table-napkin? Why, I did like the rest of the  guests: I shook it out of the folds, spread it before me, and fastened  one corner to my button-hole.'    \"'Very well, _mon cher_; you were the only person who did so. No one  shakes, spreads, and fastens a table-napkin in that manner. You should  have only laid it across your knees. What soup had you?'    \"'Turtle.'    \"'And how did you eat it?'    \"'Like every one else, I suppose. I took my spoon in one hand, and my  fork in the other--'    \"'Your fork! Good heavens! None but a savage eats soup with a fork.  But go on. What did you take next?'    \"'A boiled egg.'    \"'Good; and what did you do with the shell?'    \"'Not eat it, certainly. I left it, of course, in the egg-cup.'    \"'Without breaking it through with your spoon?'    \"'Without breaking it.'    \"'Then, my dear fellow, permit me to tell you that no one eats an egg  without breaking the shell and leaving the spoon standing in it. And  after your egg?'    \"'I asked for some _bouilli_.'    \"'For _bouilli_! It is a term that no one uses. You should have asked  for beef--never for _bouilli_. Well, and after the _bouilli_?'    \"'I asked the Abbe de Radonvilliers for some fowl.'    \"'Wretched man! Fowl, indeed! You should have asked for chicken or  capon. The word \"fowl\" is never heard out of the kitchen. But all this  applies only to what you ate; tell me something of what you drank, and  how you asked for it.'    \"'I asked for champagne and bordeaux from those who had the bottles  before them.'    \"'Know then, my good friend, that only a waiter, who has no time or  breath to spare, asks for champagne or bordeaux. A gentleman asks for  _vin de champagne_ and _vin de bordeaux_. And now inform me how you ate  your bread?'    \"'Undoubtedly like all the rest of the world. I cut it into small  square pieces with my knife.'    \"'Then let me tell you that no one cuts bread. You should always break  it. Let us go on to the coffee. How did you drink yours?'    \"'Pshaw! At least I could make no mistake in that. It was boiling hot,  so I poured it, a little at a time, in the saucer, and drank it as it  cooled.'    \"'_Eh bien_! then you assuredly acted as no other gentleman in the  room. Nothing can be more vulgar than to pour tea or coffee into a  saucer. You should have waited till it cooled, and then have drunk it  from the cup. And now you see, my dear cousin, that so far from doing  precisely as others did, you acted in no one respect according to the  laws prescribed by etiquette.'\"    An invitation to dine should be replied to immediately, and"]]]
