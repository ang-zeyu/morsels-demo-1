Yet so eagerly  If thou art bent to know the primal root,  From whence our love gat being, I will do,  As one, who weeps and tells his tale.  One day  For our delight we read of Lancelot,  How him love thrall'd.  Alone we were, and no  Suspicion near us.  Ofttimes by that reading  Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue  Fled from our alter'd cheek.  But at one point  Alone we fell.  When of that smile we read,  The wished smile, rapturously kiss'd  By one so deep in love, then he, who ne'er  From me shall separate, at once my lips  All trembling kiss'd.  The book and writer both  Were love's purveyors.  In its leaves that day  We read no more.\"  While thus one spirit spake,  The other wail'd so sorely, that heartstruck  I through compassion fainting, seem'd not far  From death, and like a corpse fell to the ground.          CANTO VI    MY sense reviving, that erewhile had droop'd  With pity for the kindred shades, whence grief  O'ercame me wholly, straight around I see  New torments, new tormented souls, which way  Soe'er I move, or turn, or bend my sight.  In the third circle I arrive, of show'rs  Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang'd  For ever, both in kind and in degree.  Large hail, discolour'd water, sleety flaw  Through the dun midnight air stream'd down amain:  Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.    Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange,  Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog  Over the multitude immers'd beneath.  His eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard,  His belly large, and claw'd the hands, with which  He tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs  Piecemeal disparts.  Howling there spread, as curs,  Under the rainy deluge, with one side  The other screening, oft they roll them round,  A wretched, godless crew.  When that great worm  Descried us, savage Cerberus, he op'd  His jaws, and the fangs show'd us; not a limb  Of him but trembled.  Then my guide, his palms  Expanding on the ground, thence filled with earth  Rais'd them, and cast it in his ravenous maw.    E'en as a dog, that yelling bays for food  His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall  His fury, bent alone with eager haste  To swallow it; so dropp'd the loathsome cheeks  Of demon Cerberus, who thund'ring stuns  The spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain.    We, o'er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt  Of the heavy tempest passing, set our feet  Upon their emptiness, that substance seem'd.    They all along the earth extended lay  Save one, that sudden rais'd himself to sit,  Soon as that way he saw us pass.  \"O thou!\"  He cried, \"who through the infernal shades art led,  Own, if again thou know'st me.  Thou wast fram'd  Or ere my frame was broken.\"  I replied:  \"The anguish thou endur'st perchance so takes  Thy form from my remembrance, that it seems  As if I saw thee never.  But inform  Me who thou art, that in a place so sad  Art set, and in such torment, that although  Other be greater, more disgustful none  Can be imagin'd.\"  He in answer thus:    \"Thy city heap'd with envy to the brim,  Ay that the measure overflows its bounds,  Held me in brighter days.  Ye citizens  Were wont to name me Ciacco.  For the sin  Of glutt'ny, damned vice, beneath this rain,  E'en as thou see'st, I with fatigue am worn;  Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these  Have by like crime incurr'd like punishment.\"    No more he said, and I my speech resum'd:  \"Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much,  Even to tears.  But tell me, if thou know'st,  What shall at length befall the citizens  Of the divided city; whether any just one  Inhabit there: and tell me of the cause,  Whence jarring discord hath assail'd it thus?\"    He then: \"After long striving they will come  To blood; and the wild party from the woods  Will chase the other with much injury forth.  Then it behoves, that this must fall, within  Three solar circles; and the other rise  By borrow'd force of one, who under shore  Now rests.  It shall a long space hold aloof  Its forehead, keeping under heavy weight  The other oppress'd, indignant at the load,  And grieving sore.  The just are two in number,  But they neglected.  Av'rice, envy, pride,  Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all  On fire.\"  Here ceas'd the lamentable sound;  And I continu'd thus: \"Still would I learn  More from thee, farther parley still entreat.  Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say,  They who so well deserv'd, of Giacopo,  Arrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent  Their minds on working good.  Oh! tell me where  They bide, and to their knowledge let me come.  For I am press'd with keen desire to hear,  If heaven's sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell  Be to their lip assign'd.\"   He answer'd straight:  \"These are yet blacker spirits.  Various crimes  Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.  If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them.  But to the pleasant world when thou return'st,  Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there.  No more I tell thee, answer thee no more.\"    This said, his fixed eyes he turn'd askance,  A little ey'd me, then bent down his head,  And 'midst his blind companions with it fell.    When thus my guide: \"No more his bed he leaves,  Ere the last angel-trumpet blow.  The Power  Adverse to these shall then in glory come,  Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair,  Resume his fleshly vesture and his form,  And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend  The vault.\"  So pass'd we through that mixture foul  Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile  Touching, though slightly, on the life to come.  For thus I question'd: \"Shall these tortures, Sir!  When the great sentence passes, be increas'd,  Or mitigated, or as now severe?\"    He then: \"Consult thy knowledge; that decides  That as each thing to more perfection grows,  It feels more sensibly both good and pain.  Though ne'er to true perfection may arrive  This race accurs'd, yet nearer then than now  They shall approach it.\"  Compassing that path  Circuitous we journeyed, and discourse  Much more than I relate between us pass'd:  Till at the point, where the steps led below,  Arriv'd, there Plutus, the great foe, we found.          CANTO VII    \"AH me!  O Satan!  Satan!\" loud exclaim'd  Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:  And the kind sage, whom no event surpris'd,  To comfort me thus spake: \"Let not thy fear  Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none  To hinder down this rock thy safe descent.\"  Then to that sworn lip turning, \"Peace!\"  he cried,    \"Curs'd wolf! thy fury inward on thyself  Prey, and consume thee!  Through the dark profound  Not without cause he passes.  So 't is will'd  On high, there where the great Archangel pour'd  Heav'n's vengeance on the first adulterer proud.\"    As sails full spread and bellying with the wind  Drop suddenly collaps'd, if the mast split;  So to the ground down dropp'd the cruel fiend.    Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,  Gain'd on the dismal shore, that all the woe  Hems in of all the universe.  Ah me!  Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap'st  New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!  Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?    E'en as a billow, on Charybdis rising,  Against encounter'd billow dashing breaks;  Such is the dance this wretched race must lead,  Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,  From one side and the other, with loud voice,  Both roll'd on weights by main forge of their breasts,  Then smote together, and each one forthwith  Roll'd them back voluble, turning again,  Exclaiming these, \"Why holdest thou so fast?\"  Those answering, \"And why castest thou away?\"  So still repeating their despiteful song,  They to the opposite point on either hand  Travers'd the horrid circle: then arriv'd,  Both turn'd them round, and through the middle space  Conflicting met again.  At sight whereof  I, stung with grief, thus spake: \"O say, my guide!  What race is this?  Were these, whose heads are shorn,  On our left hand, all sep'rate to the church?\"    He straight replied: \"In their first life these all  In mind were so distorted, that they made,  According to due measure, of their wealth,  No use.  This clearly from their words collect,  Which they howl forth, at each extremity  Arriving of the circle, where their crime  Contrary in kind disparts them.  To the church  Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls  Are crown'd, both Popes and Cardinals, o'er whom  Av'rice dominion absolute maintains.\"    I then: \"Mid such as these some needs must be,  Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot  Of these foul sins were stain'd.\"  He answering thus:  \"Vain thought conceiv'st thou.  That ignoble life,  Which made them vile before, now makes them dark,  And to all knowledge indiscernible.  Forever they shall meet in this rude shock:  These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,  Those with close-shaven locks.  That ill they gave,  And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world  Depriv'd, and set them at this strife, which needs  No labour'd phrase of mine to set it off.  Now may'st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain,  The goods committed into fortune's hands,  For which the human race keep such a coil!  Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon,  Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls  Might purchase rest for one.\"  I thus rejoin'd:    \"My guide! of thee this also would I learn;  This fortune, that thou speak'st of, what it is,  Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?\"    He thus: \"O beings blind! what ignorance  Besets you?  Now my judgment hear and mark.  He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,  The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers  To guide them, so that each part shines to each,  Their light in equal distribution pour'd.  By similar appointment he ordain'd  Over the world's bright images to rule  Superintendence of a guiding hand  And general minister, which at due time  May change the empty vantages of life  From race to race, from one to other's blood,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#4)"],[1,"the third spirit; \"then remember me.  I once was Pia.  Sienna gave me life,  Maremma took it from me.  That he knows,  Who me with jewell'd ring had first espous'd.\"      CANTO VI    When from their game of dice men separate,  He, who hath lost, remains in sadness fix'd,  Revolving in his mind, what luckless throws  He cast: but meanwhile all the company  Go with the other; one before him runs,  And one behind his mantle twitches, one  Fast by his side bids him remember him.  He stops not; and each one, to whom his hand  Is stretch'd, well knows he bids him stand aside;  And thus he from the press defends himself.  E'en such was I in that close-crowding throng;  And turning so my face around to all,  And promising, I 'scap'd from it with pains.    Here of Arezzo him I saw, who fell  By Ghino's cruel arm; and him beside,  Who in his chase was swallow'd by the stream.  Here Frederic Novello, with his hand  Stretch'd forth, entreated; and of Pisa he,  Who put the good Marzuco to such proof  Of constancy.  Count Orso I beheld;  And from its frame a soul dismiss'd for spite  And envy, as it said, but for no crime:  I speak of Peter de la Brosse; and here,  While she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant  Let her beware; lest for so false a deed  She herd with worse than these. When I was freed  From all those spirits, who pray'd for others' prayers  To hasten on their state of blessedness;  Straight I began: \"O thou, my luminary!  It seems expressly in thy text denied,  That heaven's supreme decree can never bend  To supplication; yet with this design  Do these entreat.  Can then their hope be vain,  Or is thy saying not to me reveal'd?\"    He thus to me: \"Both what I write is plain,  And these deceiv'd not in their hope, if well  Thy mind consider, that the sacred height  Of judgment doth not stoop, because love's flame  In a short moment all fulfils, which he  Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy.  Besides, when I this point concluded thus,  By praying no defect could be supplied;  Because the pray'r had none access to God.  Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not  Contented unless she assure thee so,  Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light.  I know not if thou take me right; I mean  Beatrice.  Her thou shalt behold above,  Upon this mountain's crown, fair seat of joy.\"    Then I: \"Sir! let us mend our speed; for now  I tire not as before; and lo! the hill  Stretches its shadow far.\"  He answer'd thus:  \"Our progress with this day shall be as much  As we may now dispatch; but otherwise  Than thou supposest is the truth.  For there  Thou canst not be, ere thou once more behold  Him back returning, who behind the steep  Is now so hidden, that as erst his beam  Thou dost not break.  But lo! a spirit there  Stands solitary, and toward us looks:  It will instruct us in the speediest way.\"    We soon approach'd it.  O thou Lombard spirit!  How didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood,  Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes!  It spoke not aught, but let us onward pass,  Eyeing us as a lion on his watch.  But Virgil with entreaty mild advanc'd,  Requesting it to show the best ascent.  It answer to his question none return'd,  But of our country and our kind of life  Demanded.  When my courteous guide began,  \"Mantua,\" the solitary shadow quick  Rose towards us from the place in which it stood,  And cry'd, \"Mantuan! I am thy countryman  Sordello.\"  Each the other then embrac'd.    Ah slavish Italy! thou inn of grief,  Vessel without a pilot in loud storm,  Lady no longer of fair provinces,  But brothel-house impure! this gentle spirit,  Ev'n from the Pleasant sound of his dear land  Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen  With such glad cheer; while now thy living ones  In thee abide not without war; and one  Malicious gnaws another, ay of those  Whom the same wall and the same moat contains,  Seek, wretched one! around thy sea-coasts wide;  Then homeward to thy bosom turn, and mark  If any part of the sweet peace enjoy.  What boots it, that thy reins Justinian's hand  Befitted, if thy saddle be unpress'd?  Nought doth he now but aggravate thy shame.  Ah people! thou obedient still shouldst live,  And in the saddle let thy Caesar sit,  If well thou marked'st that which God commands.    Look how that beast to felness hath relaps'd  From having lost correction of the spur,  Since to the bridle thou hast set thine hand,  O German Albert! who abandon'st her,  That is grown savage and unmanageable,  When thou should'st clasp her flanks with forked heels.  Just judgment from the stars fall on thy blood!  And be it strange and manifest to all!  Such as may strike thy successor with dread!  For that thy sire and thou have suffer'd thus,  Through greediness of yonder realms detain'd,  The garden of the empire to run waste.  Come see the Capulets and Montagues,  The Philippeschi and Monaldi! man  Who car'st for nought! those sunk in grief, and these  With dire suspicion rack'd. Come, cruel one!  Come and behold the' oppression of the nobles,  And mark their injuries: and thou mayst see.  What safety Santafiore can supply.  Come and behold thy Rome, who calls on thee,  Desolate widow! day and night with moans:  \"My Caesar, why dost thou desert my side?\"  Come and behold what love among thy people:  And if no pity touches thee for us,  Come and blush for thine own report.  For me,  If it be lawful, O Almighty Power,  Who wast in earth for our sakes crucified!  Are thy just eyes turn'd elsewhere? or is this  A preparation in the wond'rous depth  Of thy sage counsel made, for some good end,  Entirely from our reach of thought cut off?  So are the' Italian cities all o'erthrong'd  With tyrants, and a great Marcellus made  Of every petty factious villager.    My Florence! thou mayst well remain unmov'd  At this digression, which affects not thee:  Thanks to thy people, who so wisely speed.  Many have justice in their heart, that long  Waiteth for counsel to direct the bow,  Or ere it dart unto its aim: but shine  Have it on their lip's edge.  Many refuse  To bear the common burdens: readier thine  Answer uneall'd, and cry, \"Behold I stoop!\"    Make thyself glad, for thou hast reason now,  Thou wealthy! thou at peace! thou wisdom-fraught!  Facts best witness if I speak the truth.  Athens and Lacedaemon, who of old  Enacted laws, for civil arts renown'd,  Made little progress in improving life  Tow'rds thee, who usest such nice subtlety,  That to the middle of November scarce  Reaches the thread thou in October weav'st.  How many times, within thy memory,  Customs, and laws, and coins, and offices  Have been by thee renew'd, and people chang'd!    If thou remember'st well and can'st see clear,  Thou wilt perceive thyself like a sick wretch,  Who finds no rest upon her down, but oft  Shifting her side, short respite seeks from pain.          CANTO VII    After their courteous greetings joyfully  Sev'n times exchang'd, Sordello backward drew  Exclaiming, \"Who are ye?\"  \"Before this mount  By spirits worthy of ascent to God  Was sought, my bones had by Octavius' care  Been buried.  I am Virgil, for no sin  Depriv'd of heav'n, except for lack of faith.\"    So answer'd him in few my gentle guide.    As one, who aught before him suddenly  Beholding, whence his wonder riseth, cries  \"It is yet is not,\" wav'ring in belief;  Such he appear'd; then downward bent his eyes,  And drawing near with reverential step,  Caught him, where of mean estate might clasp  His lord.  \"Glory of Latium!\" he exclaim'd,  \"In whom our tongue its utmost power display'd!  Boast of my honor'd birth-place! what desert  Of mine, what favour rather undeserv'd,  Shows thee to me?  If I to hear that voice  Am worthy, say if from below thou com'st  And from what cloister's pale?\"--\"Through every orb  Of that sad region,\" he reply'd, \"thus far  Am I arriv'd, by heav'nly influence led  And with such aid I come.  There is a place  There underneath, not made by torments sad,  But by dun shades alone; where mourning's voice  Sounds not of anguish sharp, but breathes in sighs.    \"There I with little innocents abide,  Who by death's fangs were bitten, ere exempt  From human taint.  There I with those abide,  Who the three holy virtues put not on,  But understood the rest, and without blame  Follow'd them all.  But if thou know'st and canst,  Direct us, how we soonest may arrive,  Where Purgatory its true beginning takes.\"    He answer'd thus: \"We have no certain place  Assign'd us: upwards I may go or round,  Far as I can, I join thee for thy guide.  But thou beholdest now how day declines:  And upwards to proceed by night, our power  Excels: therefore it may be well to choose  A place of pleasant sojourn.  To the right  Some spirits sit apart retir'd.  If thou  Consentest, I to these will lead thy steps:  And thou wilt know them, not without delight.\"    \"How chances this?\"  was answer'd; \"who so wish'd  To ascend by night, would he be thence debarr'd  By other, or through his own weakness fail?\"    The good Sordello then, along the ground  Trailing his finger, spoke: \"Only this line  Thou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun  Hath disappear'd; not that aught else impedes  Thy going upwards, save the shades of night.  These with the wont of power perplex the will.  With them thou haply mightst return beneath,  Or to and fro around the mountain's side  Wander, while day is in the horizon shut.\"    My master straight, as wond'ring at his speech,  Exclaim'd: \"Then lead us quickly, where thou sayst,  That, while we stay, we may enjoy delight.\"    A little space we were remov'd from thence,  When I perceiv'd the mountain hollow'd out.  Ev'n as large valleys hollow'd out on earth,    \"That way,\" the' escorting spirit cried, \"we go,  Where in a bosom the high bank recedes:  And thou await renewal of the day.\"    Betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path  Led us traverse into the ridge's side,  Where more than half the sloping edge expires.
