From there we had to go on foot. We went  over to the river of red-hot lava. We planned to walk up along its edge.  But the hot rock was smoking, and the wind blew the smoke into our  faces. A thick mist of fine ashes from the crater almost suffocated us.  Sulphur fumes blew toward us and choked us. I said,    \"'We must cross the stream of lava. On the other side the wind will not  trouble us.'    \"'Cross that melted rock?' my friends cried out. 'We should sink into it  and be burned alive.'    \"But as we stood talking great stones were thrown out of the volcano.  They rolled down the mountainside close to us. If they had struck us  it would have been death. There was only one way to save ourselves. I  covered my face with my hat and rushed across the stream of lava. The  melted rock was so thick and heavy that I did not sink in. I only burned  my boots and scorched my hands. My friends followed me. On that side we  were safe. We climbed for half an hour. Then we came to the head of our  red river. It did not flow over the edge of the crater. Many feet down  from the top it had torn a hole through the cone. I shall never forget  the sight as long as I live. There was a vast arch in the black rock.  From this arch rushed a clear torrent of lava. It flowed smoothly like  honey. It glowed with all the splendor of the sun. It looked thin like  golden water.    \"'I could stir it with a stick,' said one of my friends.    \"'I doubt it,' I said. 'See how slowly it flows. It must be very thick  and heavy.'    \"To test it we threw pebbles into it. They did not sink, but floated on  like corks. We rolled in heavier stones of seventy or eighty pounds.  They only made shallow dents in the stream and floated down with the  current. A great rock of three hundred pounds lay near. I raised it upon  end and let it fall into the lava. Very slowly it sank and disappeared.    \"As the stream flowed on it spread out wider over the mountain. Farther  down the slope it grew darker and harder. It started from the arch like  melted gold. Then it changed to orange, to bright red, to dark red, to  brown, as it cooled. At the lower end it was black and hard and broken  like cinders.    \"We climbed a little higher above the arch. There was a kind of chimney  in the rock. Smoke and stream were coming out of it. I went close. The  fumes of sulphur choked me. I reached out and picked some lumps of pure  sulphur from the edge of the rock. For one moment the smoke ceased. I  held my breath and looked down the hole. I saw the glare of red-hot lava  flowing beneath. The mountain was a pot, full of boiling rock.\"    Another man writes of a visit in 1868, a quieter year.    \"At first we climbed gentle slopes through vineyards and fields and  villages. Sometimes we came suddenly upon a black line in a green  meadow. A few years before it had flowed down red-hot. Further up we  reached large stretches of rock. Here wild vines and lupines were  growing in patches where the lava had decayed into soil. Then came  bare slopes with dark hollow and sharp ridges. We walked on old stiff  lava-streams. Sometimes we had to plod through piles of coarse, porous  cinders. Sometimes we climbed over tangled, lumpy beds of twisted, shiny  rock. Sometimes we looked into dark arched tunnels. Red streams had  once flowed out of them. A few times we passed near fresh cracks in the  mountain. Here steam puffed out.    \"At last we reached a broad, hot piece of ground. Here were smoking  holes. The night before I had looked at them with a telescope from the  foot of the mountain. I had seen red rivers flowing from them. Now they  were empty. Last night's lava lay on the slope, cooled and black. I  was standing on it. My feet grew hot. I had to keep moving. The air I  breathed was warm and smelled like that of an iron foundry. I pushed my  pole into a crack in the rock. The wood caught fire. I was standing on a  thin crust. What was below? I broke out a piece of the hard lava. A red  spot glared up at me. Under the crust red-hot lava was still flowing. I  knew that it would be several years before it would be perfectly cool.\"    So for three centuries people have watched Vesuvius at work. But she is  much older than that--thousands of years older--older than any city or  country or people in the world. In all that time she has poured out  millions of tons of matter--lava, huge glassy boulders, little pebbles  of pumice stone, long shining hairs, fine dust or ashes. All these  things are different forms of melted rock. Sometimes the steam blows the  liquid into fine dust; sometimes it breaks it into little pieces and  fills them with bubbles. At another time the steam is not so strong and  only pushes the stuff out gently over the crater's edge. Many different  minerals are found in these rocks--iron, copper, lead, mica, zinc,  sulphur. Some pieces are beautiful in color--blue, green, red, yellow.  Precious stones have sometimes been found--garnets, topaz, quartz,  tourmaline, lapis lazuli. But most of the stone is dull black or brown  or gray.    All this heavy matter drops close to the mountain. And on calm days the  ashes, also, fall near at home. Indeed, the volcano has built up its own  mountain. But a heavy wind often carries the fine dust for hundreds of  miles. Once it was blown as far as Constantinople and it darkened the  sun and frightened people there. Some of the ashes fall into the sea.  For years the currents carry them about from shore to shore. At last  they settle to the bottom and make clay or sand or mud. The material  lies there for thousands of years and is hard packed into a soft fine  grained rock, called tufa. The city of Naples to-day is built of such  stone that once lay under the sea. An earthquake long ago lifted the  ocean bottom and turned it into dry land. Now men live upon it and cut  streets in it and grow crops on it.    So for many miles about, Vesuvius has been making earth. Her ashes lie  hundreds of feet deep. Men dig wells and still find only material that  has been thrown out of the volcano. When this matter grows old and lies  under the sun and rain it turns to good soil. The acids of water and air  and plants eat into it. Rain wears it away. Plant roots crack the rocks  open. The top layer becomes powdered and rotted and mixed with vegetable  loam and is fertile soil. So the country all around the volcano is a  rich garden. Tomatoes, melons, grapes, olives, figs, cover the land.    But Vesuvius alone has not made all this ground. She is in a nest of  volcanoes. They have all been at work like her, spouting ashes and  pumice and rocks and lava. Ten miles away is a wide stretch of country  where there are more than a dozen old craters. Twenty miles out in the  blue bay a volcano stands up out of the water. A hundred miles south  is a group of small volcanic islands. They have hot springs. One has a  volcano that spouts every five or six minutes. At night it is like a  lighthouse for sailors. One of these Islands is only two thousand years  old. The men of Pompeii saw it pushed up out of the sea during an  earthquake. A little farther south is Mt. Aetna in Sicily. It is a  greater mountain than Vesuvius and has done more work than she has done.  So all the southern part of Italy seems to be the home of volcanoes and  earthquakes.    There are many other such places scattered over the world--Iceland,  Mexico, South America, Japan, the Sandwich Islands. Here the same  terrible play is going on--thunder, clouds, falling ashes, scalding  rain, flowing lava. The earth is being turned inside out, and men are  learning what she is made of.      [ILLUSTRATION: _Bronze lampholder_: Five lamps hung from the branches  of this bronze tree. It was twenty inches high.]          POMPEII TO-DAY    Years came and went and changed the world. The old gods died, and the  new religion of Christ grew strong. The old temples fell into ruins, and  new churches were built in their places. Instead of the old Roman in his  white toga came merchants in crimson velvet and knights in steel armor  and gentlemen in ruffles and modern men in plain clothes.    Among all these changes, Pompeii was almost forgotten. But after a long  while people began to be much interested in ancient Italy. They read old  Roman books, and learned of her wonderful cities. They began to dig here  and there and find beautiful statues and vases and jewels. They read the  story of Pompeii in an old Roman book--a whole city suddenly buried just  as her people had left her!    \"There we should find treasures!\" they said. \"We should see houses,  temples, shops, streets, as they were seventeen hundred years ago. We  should find them full of statues and rich things. Perhaps we should find  some of the people who lived in ancient days. But where to dig?\"    Their question was answered by accident. At that time certain men were  making a tunnel to carry spring water from the hills across the country  to a little town near Naples. The tunnel happened to pass over buried  Pompeii. They dug up some blocks of stone with Latin inscriptions carved  on them. After that other people found little ancient relics near the  same place.    \"This must be where Pompeii lies buried,\" the wise men said.    They began to excavate. That was about two hundred years ago. Ever since  that time the work has gone on. Sometimes people have been discouraged  and have given up. At other times six hundred men have been working  busily. Kings have given money. Emperors and princes and queens have  visited the excavations. Artists have made pictures of the ruins, and  scholars have written books about them. But it is a great task to  uncover a whole city that is buried ten or twelve feet deep. The  excavation is not yet finished. Perhaps when you are old men and women  the work will be completed, and a whole Roman city will be open to your  eyes."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9629"],[0,"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary Part 2: More Ghost Stories (#4)"],[1," knew nothing or they wouldn't tell me. Dear,  dear, how I have been boring you with my childish remembrances! but  indeed that arbour did absorb our thoughts quite remarkably for a time.  You can fancy, can't you, the kind of stories that we made up for  ourselves. Well, dear Mrs Anstruther, I must be leaving you now. We shall  meet in town this winter, I hope, shan't we?' etc., etc.    The seats and the post were cleared away and uprooted respectively by  that evening. Late summer weather is proverbially treacherous, and during  dinner-time Mrs Collins sent up to ask for a little brandy, because her  husband had took a nasty chill and she was afraid he would not be able to  do much next day.    Mrs Anstruther's morning reflections were not wholly placid. She was sure  some roughs had got into the plantation during the night. 'And another  thing, George: the moment that Collins is about again, you must tell him  to do something about the owls. I never heard anything like them, and I'm  positive one came and perched somewhere just outside our window. If it  had come in I should have been out of my wits: it must have been a very  large bird, from its voice. Didn't you hear it? No, of course not, you  were sound asleep as usual. Still, I must say, George, you don't look as  if your night had done you much good.'    'My dear, I feel as if another of the same would turn me silly. You have  no idea of the dreams I had. I couldn't speak of them when I woke up, and  if this room wasn't so bright and sunny I shouldn't care to think of them  even now.'    'Well, really, George, that isn't very common with you, I must say. You  must have--no, you only had what I had yesterday--unless you had tea at  that wretched club house: did you?'    'No, no; nothing but a cup of tea and some bread and butter. I should  really like to know how I came to put my dream together--as I suppose one  does put one's dreams together from a lot of little things one has been  seeing or reading. Look here, Mary, it was like this--if I shan't be  boring you--'    'I _wish_ to hear what it was, George. I will tell you when I have had  enough.'    'All right. I must tell you that it wasn't like other nightmares in one  way, because I didn't really _see_ anyone who spoke to me or touched me,  and yet I was most fearfully impressed with the reality of it all. First  I was sitting, no, moving about, in an old-fashioned sort of panelled  room. I remember there was a fireplace and a lot of burnt papers in it,  and I was in a great state of anxiety about something. There was someone  else--a servant, I suppose, because I remember saying to him, \"Horses, as  quick as you can,\" and then waiting a bit: and next I heard several  people coming upstairs and a noise like spurs on a boarded floor, and  then the door opened and whatever it was that I was expecting happened.'    'Yes, but what was that?'    'You see, I couldn't tell: it was the sort of shock that upsets you in a  dream. You either wake up or else everything goes black. That was what  happened to me. Then I was in a big dark-walled room, panelled, I think,  like the other, and a number of people, and I was evidently--'    'Standing your trial, I suppose, George.'    'Goodness! yes, Mary, I was; but did you dream that too? How very odd!'    'No, no; I didn't get enough sleep for that. Go on, George, and I will  tell you afterwards.'    'Yes; well, I _was_ being tried, for my life, I've no doubt, from the  state I was in. I had no one speaking for me, and somewhere there was a  most fearful fellow--on the bench; I should have said, only that he seemed  to be pitching into me most unfairly, and twisting everything I said, and  asking most abominable questions.'    'What about?'    'Why, dates when I was at particular places, and letters I was supposed  to have written, and why I had destroyed some papers; and I recollect his  laughing at answers I made in a way that quite daunted me. It doesn't  sound much, but I can tell you, Mary, it was really appalling at the  time. I am quite certain there was such a man once, and a most horrible  villain he must have been. The things he said--'    'Thank you, I have no wish to hear them. I can go to the links any day  myself. How did it end?'    'Oh, against me; _he_ saw to that. I do wish, Mary, I could give you a  notion of the strain that came after that, and seemed to me to last for  days: waiting and waiting, and sometimes writing things I knew to be  enormously important to me, and waiting for answers and none coming, and  after that I came out--'    'Ah!'    'What makes you say that? Do you know what sort of thing I saw?'    'Was it a dark cold day, and snow in the streets, and a fire burning  somewhere near you?'    'By George, it was! You _have_ had the same nightmare! Really not? Well,  it is the oddest thing! Yes; I've no doubt it was an execution for high  treason. I know I was laid on straw and jolted along most wretchedly, and  then had to go up some steps, and someone was holding my arm, and I  remember seeing a bit of a ladder and hearing a sound of a lot of people.  I really don't think I could bear now to go into a crowd of people and  hear the noise they make talking. However, mercifully, I didn't get to  the real business. The dream passed off with a sort of thunder inside my  head. But, Mary--'    'I know what you are going to ask. I suppose this is an instance of a  kind of thought-reading. Miss Wilkins called yesterday and told me of a  dream her brother had as a child when they lived here, and something did  no doubt make me think of that when I was awake last night listening to  those horrible owls and those men talking and laughing in the shrubbery  (by the way, I wish you would see if they have done any damage, and speak  to the police about it); and so, I suppose, from my brain it must have  got into yours while you were asleep. Curious, no doubt, and I am sorry  it gave you such a bad night. You had better be as much in the fresh air  as you can to-day.'    'Oh, it's all right now; but I think I _will_ go over to the Lodge and  see if I can get a game with any of them. And you?'    'I have enough to do for this morning; and this afternoon, if I am not  interrupted, there is my drawing.'    'To be sure--I want to see that finished very much.'    No damage was discoverable in the shrubbery. Mr Anstruther surveyed with  faint interest the site of the rose garden, where the uprooted post still  lay, and the hole it had occupied remained unfilled. Collins, upon  inquiry made, proved to be better, but quite unable to come to his work.  He expressed, by the mouth of his wife, a hope that he hadn't done  nothing wrong clearing away them things. Mrs Collins added that there was  a lot of talking people in Westfield, and the hold ones was the worst:  seemed to think everything of them having been in the parish longer than  what other people had. But as to what they said no more could then be  ascertained than that it had quite upset Collins, and was a lot of  nonsense.           *       *       *       *       *    Recruited by lunch and a brief period of slumber, Mrs Anstruther settled  herself comfortably upon her sketching chair in the path leading through  the shrubbery to the side-gate of the churchyard. Trees and buildings  were among her favourite subjects, and here she had good studies of both.  She worked hard, and the drawing was becoming a really pleasant thing to  look upon by the time that the wooded hills to the west had shut off the  sun. Still she would have persevered, but the light changed rapidly, and  it became obvious that the last touches must be added on the morrow. She  rose and turned towards the house, pausing for a time to take delight in  the limpid green western sky. Then she passed on between the dark  box-bushes, and, at a point just before the path debouched on the lawn,  she stopped once again and considered the quiet evening landscape, and  made a mental note that that must be the tower of one of the Roothing  churches that one caught on the sky-line. Then a bird (perhaps) rustled  in the box-bush on her left, and she turned and started at seeing what at  first she took to be a Fifth of November mask peeping out among the  branches. She looked closer.    It was not a mask. It was a face--large, smooth, and pink. She remembers  the minute drops of perspiration which were starting from its forehead:  she remembers how the jaws were clean-shaven and the eyes shut. She  remembers also, and with an accuracy which makes the thought intolerable  to her, how the mouth was open and a single tooth appeared below the  upper lip. As she looked the face receded into the darkness of the bush.  The shelter of the house was gained and the door shut before she  collapsed.    Mr and Mrs Anstruther had been for a week or more recruiting at Brighton  before they received a circular from the Essex Archaeological Society,  and a query as to whether they possessed certain historical portraits  which it was desired to include in the forthcoming work on Essex  Portraits, to be published under the Society's auspices. There was an  accompanying letter from the Secretary which contained the following  passage: 'We are specially anxious to know whether you possess the  original of the engraving of which I enclose a photograph. It represents  Sir ---- ----, Lord Chief Justice under Charles II, who, as you doubtless  know, retired after his disgrace to Westfield, and is supposed to have  died there of remorse. It may interest you to hear that a curious entry  has recently been found in the registers, not of Westfield but of Priors  Roothing, to the effect that the parish was so much troubled after his  death that the rector of Westfield summoned the parsons of all the  Roothings to come and lay him; which they did. The entry ends by saying:  \"The stake is in a field adjoining to the churchyard of Westfield, on the  west side.\" Perhaps"]]]
