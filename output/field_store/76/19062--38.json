There is no  religious shoddy amongst these persons. They may look solemn, yet  some of them have finely moulded features; they may dress strangely  and gloomily, yet, if you converse with them, they will always give  indications of serener spirits. Whether their profession be right or  wrong, this is certain:  they keep one of the best schools in the  town, and they teach children manners--a thing which many parents  can't manage. They also make themselves useful in visiting; they  have a certain respect for faith, but more for good works; and if  other folk in Christendom held similar views on this point the good  done would in the end be greater. All these Sisters of Mercy are  accomplished--they are clever in the head, know how to play music,  to paint, and to sew; can cook well if they like; and it's a pity  they are not married. But they are doing more good single than lots  of women are accomplishing in the married state, and we had better  let them alone. Its dangerous to either command or advise the  gentler sex, and as everything finds its own level by having its own  way they will, we suppose, in the end.    One of the most noticeable features in connection with the services  at St. Wilfrid's is the music. It is proverbial that Catholics have  good music. You won't find any of the drawling, face-pulling,  rubbishy melodies worked up to a point of agony in some places of  worship countenanced in the Catholic Church. All is classical--all  from the best masters. There is an enchantment in the music which  binds you--makes you like it whether you will or not. At St.  Wilfrid's there is a choir which can't be excelled by any provincial  body of singers in the kingdom. The learned individual who blows the  organ may say that the comparative perfection attained in the  orchestra is through the very consummate manner in which he \"raises  the wind\"; the gentleman who manipulates upon its keys may think he  is the primum mobile in the matter; the soprano may fancy she is the  life of the whole concern; the heavy bass or the chief tenor may  respectively lay claim to the honour; but the fact is, its amongst  the lot, so that there may be a general rubbing on the question of  service, and a reciprocal scratching on the point of ability.    There are several priests at St. Wilfrid's; they are all Jesuits to  the marrow; and the chief of them is the Rev. Father Cobb. Each of  them is clever--far cleverer than many of the half-feathered curates  and full-fledged incumbents who are constantly bringing railing  accusations against them; and they work harder--get up sooner, go to  bed later--than the whole of them. They jump at midnight if their  services are required by either a wild Irishman in Canal-street or a  gentleman of the first water in any of our mansions. It is not a  question of cloth but of souls with them. They are afraid of neither  plague, pestilence, nor famine; they administer spiritual  consolation under silken hangings, as well as upon straw lairs; in  the fever stricken garret as well as in the gilded chamber. Neither  the nature of a man's position nor the character of his disease  enters into their considerations. Duty is the star of their  programme; action the object of their lives. They receive no  salaries; their simple necessaries are alone provided for. Some of  them perhaps get half-a-crown a month as pocket money; but that will  neither kill nor cure a man. Sevenpence halfpenny per week is a big  sum--isn't it?--big enough for a Jesuit priest, but calculated to  disturb the Christian balance of any other class of clergymen. If it  isn't, try them.    In reference to the priests of St. Wilfrid's, we shall only  specially mention, and that briefly, the Rev. Father Cobb. No man in  Preston cares less for fine clothes than he does. We once did see  him with a new suit on; but neither before nor since that ever-  memorable day, have we noticed him in anything more ethereal than a  plain well-worn coat, waistcoat, and pair of trousers. He might have  a finer exterior; but he cares not for this kind of bauble. He knows  that trappings make neither the man nor the Christian, and that  elaborate suits are often the synonym of elaborate foolery. He takes  a pleasure in work; is happy inaction; and hates both clerical and  secular indifference. Priests, he thinks, ought to do their duty,  and men of the world ought to discharge theirs. In education, Father  Cobb is far above the ordinary run of men. He has a great natural  capacity, which has been well regulated by study; he is shrewd; has  a strong intuitive sense; can't be got over; won't be beaten out of  the field if you once get him into it; and is sure to either win or  make you believe that he has. Like all strong Catholics he has much  veneration--that \"organ,\" speaking in the vernacular of phrenology,  is at the top of the head, and you never yet saw a thorough Catholic  who did not manifest a good development of it; he is strong in  ideality; has also a fine, vein of humour in him; can laugh, say  jolly as well as serious things; and is a positively earnest and  practical preacher. He speaks right out to his hearers; hits them  hard in reference to both this world and the next; tells them \"what  to eat, drink, and avoid;\" says that if they get drunk they must  drop it off, that if they stuff and gormandise they will be a long  while before reaching the kingdom of heaven; that they must avoid  dishonesty, falsehood, impurity, and other delinquencies; and,  furthermore, intimates that they won't get to any of the saints they  have a particular liking for by a round of simple religious  formality--that they must be good, do good, and behave themselves  decently, individually and collectively. We have never heard a more  practical preacher:  he will tell young women what sort of husbands  to get, young men what kind of wives to choose, married folk how to  conduct themselves, and old maids and bachelors how to reconcile  themselves virtuously to their fate. There is no half-and-half ring  in the metal he moulds:  it comes out clear, sounds well, and goes  right home. In delivery he is eloquent; in action rather brisk; and  he weighs--one may as well come down from the sublime to the  ridiculous--about thirteen stones. He is a jolly, hearty, earnest,  devoted priest; is cogent in argument; homely in illustration;  tireless in work; determined to do his duty; and, if we were a  Catholic, we should be inclined to fight for him if any one stepped  upon his toes, or said a foul word about him. Here endeth our  \"epistle to the Romans.\"        No. III.        CANNON-STREET INDEPENDENT CHAPEL.        Forty-four years ago the Ebenezer of a few believers in the \"Bird-  of-Freedom\" school, with a spice of breezy religious courage in  their composition, was raised at the bottom of Cannon-street, in  Preston; and to this day it abideth there. Why it was elevated at  that particular period of the world's history we cannot say. Neither  does it signify. It may have been that the spirit of an  irrepressible Brown, older than the Harper's Ferry gentleman, was  \"marching on\" at an extra speed just then; for let it be known to  all and singular that it was one of the universal Brown family who  founded the general sect. Or it may have been that certain  Prestonians, with a lingering touch of the \"Scot's wha ha'e\"  material in their blood, gave a solemn twist to the line in Burns's  epistle, and decided to go in    --for the glorious privilege  Of being Independent.    Be that as it may, it is clear that in 1825 the Independents planted  a chapel in Cannon-street. Places of worship like everything else,  good or evil, grow in these latter days, and so has Cannon-street  chapel. In 1852 its supporters set at naught the laws of Banting,  and made the place bigger. It was approaching a state of solemn  tightness, and for the consolation of the saints, the ease of the  fidgety, and the general blissfulness of the neighbourhood it was  expanded. Cannon-street Chapel has neither a bell, nor a steeple,  nor an outside clock, and it has never yet said that it was any  worse off for their absence. But it may do, for chapels like  churches are getting proud things now-a-days, and they believe in  both lacker and gilt. There is something substantial and respectable  about the building. It is neither gaudy nor paltry; neither too good  nor too bad looking. Nobody will ever die in a state of  architectural ecstacy through gazing upon it; and not one out of a  battalion of cynics will say that it is too ornamental. It is one of  those well-finished, middle-class looking establishments, about  which you can't say much any way; and if you could, nobody would be  either madder or wiser for the exposition. Usually the only  noticeable feature about the front of it--and that is generally the  place where one looks for the virtues or vices of a thing--is a  series of caged-up boards, announcing homilies, and tea parties, and  collections all over the north Lancashire portion of Congregational  Christendom. It is to be hoped that the sermons are not too dry,  that the tea saturnalias are neither too hot nor too wet, and that  the collections have more sixpenny than threepenny pieces in them.    The interior of Cannon-street Chapel has a spacious and somewhat  genteel appearance. A practical business air pervades it. There is  no \"storied window,\" scarcely any \"dim religious light,\" and not a  morsel of extra colouring in the whole establishment.

Crassus, Pompey, P.  Sextus, M. Marcellus, P. Clodius, Asinius Pollio, C. Cicero, M.  Antonius, Julius Caesar, Caelius, Brutus, Catullus, were all celebrated  for their forensic efforts. Candidates for the bar studied four years  under a distinguished jurist, and were required to pass a rigorous  examination. The judges were chosen from members of the bar, as well as  in later times the senators. The great lawyers were not only learned in  the law, but possessed great accomplishments. Varro was a lawyer, and  was the most learned man that Rome ever produced. But under the emperors  the lawyers were chiefly distinguished for their legal attainments, like  Paulus and Ulpian.    During this golden age of Roman jurisprudence many commentaries were  written on the Twelve Tables, the Perpetual Edict, the Laws of the  People, and the Decrees of the senate, as well as a vast mass of  treatises on every department of the law, most of which have perished.  The Institutes of Gaius, already mentioned, are the most valuable that  remain, and have thrown great light on some important branches  previously involved in obscurity. Their use in explaining the Institutes  of Justinian is spoken of very highly by Mackenzie, since the latter are  mainly founded on the long-lost work of Gaius. The great lawyers who  flourished from Trajan to Alexander Severus, like Gaius, Ulpian, Paulus,  Papinian, and Modestinus, had no successors who can be compared with  them, and their works became standard authorities in the courts of law.    After the death of Alexander Severus, 235 A.D., no great accession was  made to Roman law until Theodosius II., 438 A.D., caused the  constitutions, from Constantine to his own time, to be collected and  arranged in sixteen books. This was called the Theodosian Code, which  in the West was held in high esteem. It was very influential among the  Germanic nations, serving as the chief basis of their early legislation;  it also paved the way for the more complete codification that followed  in the Justinian Code, which superseded it.    To Justinian belongs the immortal glory of reforming the jurisprudence  of the Romans. \"In the space of ten centuries,\" says Gibbon, \"the  infinite variety of laws and legal opinions had filled many thousand  volumes, which no fortune could purchase, and no capacity could digest.  Books could not easily be found, and the judges, poor in the midst of  riches, were reduced to the exercise of their illiterate discretion.\"  The emperors had very early begun to issue ordinances, under the  authority of the various offices gathered into their hands; and these,  together with the answers to appeals from the lower courts made to the  emperors directly, or to the sort of supreme court which they  established, were called _imperial constitutions_ and _rescripts_.  Justinian determined to unite in one body all the rules of law, whatever  may have been their origin; and in the year 528 appointed ten  jurisconsults, among whom was the celebrated Tribonian, to select and  arrange the imperial constitutions and rescripts, leaving out what was  obsolete or useless or contradictory, and to make such alterations as  the circumstances required. This was called the _Code_, divided into  twelve books, and comprising the constitutions from Hadrian to  Justinian. It was published in fourteen months after it was undertaken.    Justinian thereupon authorized Tribonian, then quaestor, _vir magnificus  magisteria dignitate inter agentes decoratus,_--\"for great titles were  now given to the officers of the crown,\"--to prepare, with the  assistance of sixteen associates, a collection of extracts from the  writings of the most eminent jurists, so as to form a body of law for  the government of the empire, with power to select and omit and alter;  and this immense work was done in three years, and published under the  title of Digest, or Pandects. Says Lord Mackenzie:    \"All the judicial learning of former times was laid under contribution  by Tribonian and his colleagues. Selections from the works of  thirty-nine of the ablest lawyers, scattered over two thousand separate  treatises, were collected in one volume; and care was taken to inform  posterity that three millions of lines were abridged and reduced in  these extracts to the modest number of one hundred and fifty thousand.  Among the selected jurists only three names belonged to the age of the  republic,--the civilians who flourished under the first emperors are  seldom appealed to; so that most of the writers whose works have  contributed to the Pandects lived within a period of one hundred years.  More than a third of the whole Pandects is from Ulpian, and next to him  the principal writers are Paulus, Papinian, Salvius Julianus, Pomponius,  Q. Cervidius Scaevola, and Gaius. Though the variety of subjects is  immense, the Digest has no claims to scientific arrangement. It is a  vast cyclopedia of heterogeneous law badly arranged; everything is  there, but everything is not in its proper place.\"    Neither the Digest nor the Code was adapted to elementary instruction;  it was therefore necessary to prepare a treatise on the principles of  Roman law. This was intrusted to Tribonian and two professors,  Theophilus and Dorotheus. It is probable that Tribonian merely  superintended the work, which was founded chiefly on the Institutes of  Gaius, divided into four books. It has been universally admired for its  method and elegant precision. It was intended merely as an introduction  to the Pandects and the Code, and was entitled the Institutes.    The _Novels_, or _New Constitutions, of Justinian_ were subsequently  published, being the new ordinances of the Emperor and the changes he  thought proper to make, and were therefore of high authority. The Code,  Pandects, Institutes, and Novels of Justinian comprise the Roman law as  received in Europe, in the form given by the school of Bologna, and is  called the \"Corpus Juris Civilis.\" Savigny says:--    \"It was in that form that the Roman law became the common law of Europe;  and when, four centuries later, other sources came to be added to it,  the _Corpus Juris_ of the school of Bologna had been so universally  received, and so long established as a basis of practice, that the new  discoveries remained in the domain of science, and served only for the  theory of the law. For the same reason, the Ante-Justinian law is  excluded from practice.\"    After Justinian the old texts were left to moulder as useless though  venerable, and they have nearly all disappeared. The Code, the Pandects,  and the Institutes were declared to be the only legitimate authority,  and alone were admitted to the tribunals or taught in the schools. The  rescripts of the early emperors recognized too many popular rights to  suit the despotic character of Justinian; and the older jurists, like  the Scaevolas, Sulpicius, and Labeo, were distasteful from their  sympathy with free institutions. Different opinions have been expressed  by the jurisconsults as to the merits of the Justinian collection. By  some it is regarded as a vast mass of legal lumber; by others, as a  beautiful monument of human labor. After the lapse of so many centuries  it is certain that a large portion of it is of no practical utility,  since it is not applicable to modern wants. But again, no one doubts  that it has exercised a great and good influence on moral and political  science, and introduced many enlightened views concerning the  administration of justice as well as the nature of civil government, and  thus has modified the codes of the Teutonic nations that sprang up on  the ruins of the old Roman world. It was used in the Greek empire until  the fall of Constantinople. It never entirely lost authority in Italy,  although it remained buried for centuries, till the discovery of the  Florentine copy of the Pandects at the siege of Amalfi in 1135. Peter  Valence, in the eleventh century, made use of it in a law-book which he  published.    With the rise of the Italian cities, the study of Roman law revived, and  Bologna became the seat from which it spread over Europe. In the  sixteenth century the science of theoretical law passed from Italy to  France, under the auspices of Francis I., when Cujas, or Cujacius,  became the great ornament of the school of Bourges and the greatest  commentator on Roman law until Dumoulin appeared. Grotius, in Holland,  excited the same interest in civil law that Dumoulin did in France,  followed by eminent professors in Leyden and the German universities. It  was reserved for Pothier, in the middle of the eighteenth century, to  reduce the Roman law to systematic order,--one of the most gigantic  tasks that ever taxed the industry of man. The recent discoveries,  especially that made by Niebuhr of the long-lost work of Gaius, have  given a great impulse to the study of Roman law in Germany; and to this  impulse no one has contributed so greatly as Savigny of Berlin.    The great importance of the subject demands a more minute notice of the  principles of the Roman law than the limits of this work properly allow.  I shall therefore endeavor to abridge what has been written by eminent  authorities, taking as a basis the late work of Lord Mackenzie and the  learned and interesting essay of Professor Maine.    The Institutes of Justinian began with the law of persons, recognizing  the distinction of ranks. All persons are capable of enjoying civil  rights, but not all in the same degree. Greater privileges are allowed  to men than to women, to freemen than to slaves, to fathers than  to children.    In the eye of the law all Roman citizens were equal wherever they lived,  whether in the capital or the provinces. Citizenship embraced both  political and civil rights. Political rights had reference to the right  of voting in the comitia; but"]]]
