[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13008"],[0,"The Edda, Volume 2 (#5)"],[1,"elgi, he killed her accidentally in swinging  his sword.    There can be little doubt that these three are merely variants of the  same story; the foundation is the same, though incidents and names  differ. The three Helgis are one hero, and the three versions of his  legend probably come from different localities. The collector could  not but feel their identity, and the similarity was too fundamental  to be overlooked; he therefore accounted for it by the old idea of  re-birth, and thus linked the three together. In each Helgi has an  hereditary foe (Hrodmar, Hunding, or Hadding); in each his bride is a  Valkyrie, who protects him and gives him victory; each ends in tragedy,  though differently.    The two variants in the Poetic Edda have evident marks  of contamination with the Volsung cycle, and some points of  superficial resemblance. Helgi Hjoervardsson's mother is Sigrlinn,  Helgi Hundings-bane's father is Sigmund, as in the _Nibelungen Lied_  Siegfried is the son of Sigemunt and Sigelint. Helgi Hundingsbane is  a Volsung and Wolfing (Ylfing), and brother to Sinfjoetli; his first  fight, like Sigurd's, is against the race of Hunding; his rival,  Hoedbrodd, is a Hniflung; he first meets the Valkyrie on Loga-fell  (Flame-hill); he is killed by his brother-in-law, who has sworn  friendship. But there is no parallel to the essential features of the  Volsung cycle, and such likenesses between the two stories as are not  accidental are due to the influence of the more favoured legend; this  is especially true of the names. The prose-piece _Sinfjoetli's Death_  also makes Helgi half-brother to Sinfjoetli; it is followed in this  by _Voelsunga Saga_, which devotes a chapter to Helgi, paraphrasing  _Helyi Hundingsbane I_. There is, of course, confusion over the  Hunding episode; the saga is obliged to reconcile its conflicting  authorities by making Helgi kill Hunding and some of his sons, and  Sigurd kill the rest.    If the theory stated below as to the original Helgi legend be correct,  the feud with Hunding's race, as told in these poems, must be  extraneous. I conjecture that it belonged originally to the Volsung  cycle, and to the wer-wolf Sinfjoetli. It must not be forgotten that,  though he passes out of the Volsung story altogether in the later  versions, both Scandinavian and German, he is in the main action  in the earliest one (that in _Beowulf_), where even Sigurd does not  appear. The feud might easily have been transferred from him to Helgi  as well as to Sigurd, for invention is limited as regards episodes,  and a narrator who wishes to elaborate the story of a favourite hero  is often forced to borrow adventures. In the original story, Helgi's  blood-feud was probably with the kindred of Sigrun or Svava.    The origin of the Helgi legend must be sought outside of the Volsung  cycle. Some writers are of opinion that the name should be Holgi,  and there are two stories in which a hero Holgi appears. With  the legend of Thorgerd Holgabrud, told by Saxo, who identified it  with that of Helgi Hundingsbane, it has nothing in common; and the  connection which has been sought with the legend of Holger Danske is  equally difficult to establish. The essence of this latter story is  the hero's disappearance into fairyland, and the expectation of his  return sometime in the future: a motive which has been very fruitful  in Irish romance, and in the traditions of Arthur, Tryggvason, and  Barbarossa, among countless others. But it is absent from the Helgi  poems; and the \"old wives' tales\" of Helgi's re-birth have nothing  to do with his legend, but are merely a bookman's attempt to connect  stories which he felt to be the same though different.    The essential feature of the story told in these poems is the motive  familiar in that class of ballads of which the _Douglas Tragedy_ is a  type: the hero loves the daughter of his enemy's house, her kinsmen  kill him, and she dies of grief. This is the story told in both the  lays of _Helgi Hundingsbane_, complete in one, unfinished in the  other. No single poem preserves all the incidents of the legend; some  survive in one version, some in another, as usual in ballad literature.    Like Sinfjoetli and Sigurd, Helgi is brought up in obscurity. He spends  his childhood disguised in his enemy's household, and on leaving it,  sends a message to tell his foes whom they have fostered. They pursue  him, and he is obliged, like Gude Wallace in the Scottish ballad,  to disguise himself in a bondmaid's dress:    \"Piercing are the eyes of Hagal's bondmaid; it is no peasant's kin who  stands at the mill: the stones are split, the bin springs in two. It  is a hard fate for a warrior to grind the barley; the sword-hilt is  better fitted for those hands than the mill-handle.\"    Sigrun is present at the battle, in which, as in the English and  Scottish ballads, Helgi slays all her kindred except one brother. He  tells her the fortunes of the fight, and she chooses between lover  and kinsmen:    _Helgi_. \"Good luck is not granted thee, maid, in all things,  though the Norns are partly to blame. Bragi and Hoegni fell to-day  at Frekastein, and I was their slayer;... most of thy kindred lie  low. Thou couldst not hinder the battle: it was thy fate to be a cause  of strife to heroes. Weep not, Sigrun, thou hast been Hild to us;  heroes must meet their fate.\"    _Sigrun_. \"I could wish those alive who are fallen, and yet rest in  thy arms.\"    The surviving brother, Dag, swears oaths of reconciliation to Helgi,  but remembers the feud. The end comes, as in the Norse Sigmund tale,  through Odin's interference: he lends his spear to Dag, who stabs Helgi  in a grove, and rides home to tell his sister. Sigrun is inconsolable,  and curses the murderer with a rare power and directness:    \"May the oaths pierce thee that thou hast sworn to Helgi.... May the  ship sail not that sails under thee, though a fair wind lie behind. May  the horse run not that runs under thee, though thou art fleeing from  thy foes. May the sword bite not that thou drawest, unless it sing  round thine own head. If thou wert an outlaw in the woods, Helgi's  death were avenged.... Never again while I live, by night or day,  shall I sit happy at Sevafell, if I see not the light play on my hero's  company, nor the gold-bitted War-breeze run thither with the warrior.\"    But Helgi returns from the grave, unable to rest because of Sigrun's  weeping, and she goes down into the howe with him:    _Sigrun_. \"Thy hair is covered with frost, Helgi; thou art drenched  with deadly dew, thy hands are cold and wet. How shall I get thee help,  my hero?\"    _Helgi_. \"Thou alone hast caused it, Sigrun from Sevafell, that Helgi  is drenched with deadly dew. Thou weepest bitter tears before thou  goest to sleep, gold-decked, sunbright, Southern maid; each one falls  on my breast, bloody, cold and wet, cruel, heavy with grief....\"    _Sigrun_. \"I have made thee here a painless bed, Helgi, son of the  Wolfings. I will sleep in thy arms, my warrior, as if thou wert alive.\"    _Helgi_. \"There shall be no stranger thing at Sevafell, early or late,  than that thou, king-born, Hoegni's fair daughter, shouldst be alive  in the grave and sleep in a dead man's arms.\"    The lay of Helgi Hjoervardsson is furthest from the original, for there  is no feud with Svava's kindred, nor does Helgi die at their hands;  but it preserves a feature omitted elsewhere, in his leaving his bride  to his brother's protection. Like the wife in the English ballad of  _Earl Brand_, and the heroine of the Danish _Ribold and Guldborg_,  Svava refuses, but Hedin's last words seem to imply that he is to  return and marry her after avenging Helgi. This would be contrary to  all parallels, according to which Svava should die with Helgi.    The alternative ending of the _Helgi and Kara_ version is interesting  as providing the possible source of another Scottish ballad dealing  with the same type of story. In _The Cruel Knight_, as here, the  hero slays his bride, who is of a hostile family, by mistake. One  passage of _Helgi Hundingsbane II._  describes Helgi's entrance into  Valhalla, which, taken with the incident of Sigrun's joining him  in the howe, supplies an instance of the survival side by side of  inconsistent notions as to the state of the dead. The lover's return  from the grave is the subject of _Clerk Saunders_ (the second part)  and several other Scottish ballads.    _The Song of the Mill_.--The magic mill is best known in the folk-tale,  \"Why the sea is salt\"; but this is not the oldest part of the story,  though it took most hold of the popular imagination which loves  legendary explanations of natural phenomena. The hero, Frodi, a  mythical Danish king, is the northern Croesus. His reign was marked  by a world-peace, and the peace, the wealth, the liberality of Frodi  became proverbial. The motive of his tale is again the curse that  follows gold. It is told by Snorri, in whose work _Grottasoengr_  is embodied.    Frodi possessed two magic quern-stones, from which the grinder could  grind out whatever he wished; but he had no one strong enough to turn  them until he bought in Sweden two bondmaids of giant-race, Menja and  Fenja. He set them to grind at the quern by day, and by night when  all slept, and as they ground him gold, and peace, and prosperity,  they sang:    \"We grind wealth for Frodi, all bliss we grind, and abundance of  riches in the fortunate bin. May he sit on wealth, may he sleep on  down, may he wake to delight; then the grinding were good. Here shall  no man hurt another, prepare evil nor work death, nor hew with the  keen sword though he find his brother's slayer bound.\"    But when they wearied of their toil and asked for a little rest,  Frodi answered: \"Ye shall sleep no longer than the cuckoo is silent,  or while I speak one stave.\" Then the giant-maids grew angry, and sang:    \"Thou wert not wise, Frodi, in buying thy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],[0,"Tales of Old Japan (#5)"],[1,"le,  and all their comrades collected together at the call; then Oishi  Kuranosuke, bringing a lantern, scanned the old man's features, and it  was indeed Kotsuke no Suke; and if further proof were wanting, he  still bore a scar on his forehead where their master, Asano Takumi no  Kami, had wounded him during the affray in the castle. There being no  possibility of mistake, therefore, Oishi Kuranosuke went down on his  knees, and addressing the old man very respectfully, said--    \"My lord, we are the retainers of Asano Takumi no Kami. Last year your  lordship and our master quarrelled in the palace, and our master was  sentenced to _hara-kiri,_ and his family was ruined. We have come  to-night to avenge him, as is the duty of faithful and loyal men. I  pray your lordship to acknowledge the justice of our purpose. And now,  my lord, we beseech you to perform _hara-kiri_. I myself shall have  the honour to act as your second, and when, with all humility, I shall  have received your lordship's head, it is my intention to lay it as an  offering upon the grave of Asano Takumi no Kami.\"    Thus, in consideration of the high rank of Kotsuke no Suke, the Ronins  treated him with the greatest courtesy, and over and over again  entreated him to perform _hara-kiri._ But he crouched speechless and  trembling. At last Kuranosuke, seeing that it was vain to urge him to  die the death of a nobleman, forced him down, and cut off his head  with the same dirk with which Asano Takumi no Kami had killed himself.  Then the forty-seven comrades, elated at having accomplished their  design, placed the head in a bucket, and prepared to depart; but  before leaving the house they carefully extinguished all the lights  and fires in the place, lest by any accident a fire should break out  and the neighbours suffer.    As they were on their way to Takanawa, the suburb in which the temple  called Sengakuji stands, the day broke; and the people flocked out to  see the forty-seven men, who, with their clothes and arms all  blood-stained, presented a terrible appearance; and every one praised  them, wondering at their valour and faithfulness. But they expected  every moment that Kotsuke no Suke's father-in-law would attack them  and carry off the head, and made ready to die bravely sword in hand.  However, they reached Takanawa in safety, for Matsudaira Aki no Kami,  one of the eighteen chief daimios of Japan, of whose house Asano  Takumi no Kami had been a cadet, had been highly pleased when he heard  of the last night's work, and he had made ready to assist the Ronins  in case they were attacked. So Kotsuke no Suke's father-in-law dared  not pursue them.    At about seven in the morning they came opposite to the palace of  Matsudaira Mutsu no Kami, the Prince of Sendai, and the Prince,  hearing of it, sent for one of his councillors and said: \"The  retainers of Takumi no Kami have slain their lord's enemy, and are  passing this way; I cannot sufficiently admire their devotion, so, as  they must be tired and hungry after their night's work, do you go and  invite them to come in here, and set some gruel and a cup of wine  before them.\"    So the councillor went out and said to Oishi Kuranosuke: \"Sir, I am a  councillor of the Prince of Sendai, and my master bids me beg you, as  you must be worn out after all you have undergone, to come in and  partake of such poor refreshment as we can offer you. This is my  message to you from my lord.\"    \"I thank you, sir,\" replied Kuranosuke. \"It is very good of his  lordship to trouble himself to think of us. We shall accept his  kindness gratefully.\"    So the forty-seven Ronins went into the palace, and were feasted with  gruel and wine, and all the retainers of the Prince of Sendai came and  praised them.    Then Kuranosuke turned to the councillor and said, \"Sir, we are truly  indebted to you for this kind hospitality; but as we have still to  hurry to Sengakuji, we must needs humbly take our leave.\" And, after  returning many thanks to their hosts, they left the palace of the  Prince of Sendai and hastened to Sengakuji, where they were met by the  abbot of the monastery, who went to the front gate to receive them,  and led them to the tomb of Takumi no Kami.    And when they came to their lord's grave, they took the head of  Kotsuke no Suke, and having washed it clean in a well hard by, laid it  as an offering before the tomb. When they had done this, they engaged  the priests of the temple to come and read prayers while they burnt  incense: first Oishi Kuranosuke burnt incense, and then his son Oishi  Chikara, and after them the other forty-five men performed the same  ceremony. Then Kuranosuke, having given all the money that he had by  him to the abbot, said--    \"When we forty-seven men shall have performed _hara-kiri_, I beg you  to bury us decently. I rely upon your kindness. This is but a trifle  that I have to offer; such as it is, let it be spent in masses for our  souls!\"    And the abbot, marvelling at the faithful courage of the men, with  tears in his eyes pledged himself to fulfil their wishes. So the  forty-seven Ronins, with their minds at rest, waited patiently until  they should receive the orders of the Government.    At last they were summoned to the Supreme Court, where the governors  of Yedo and the public censors had assembled; and the sentence passed  upon them was as follows: \"Whereas, neither respecting the dignity of  the city nor fearing the Government, having leagued yourselves  together to slay your enemy, you violently broke into the house of  Kira Kotsuke no Suke by night and murdered him, the sentence of the  Court is, that, for this audacious conduct, you perform _hara-kiri_.\"  When the sentence had been read, the forty-seven Ronins were divided  into four parties, and handed over to the safe keeping of four  different daimios; and sheriffs were sent to the palaces of those  daimios in whose presence the Ronins were made to perform _hara-kiri_.  But, as from the very beginning they had all made up their minds that  to this end they must come, they met their death nobly; and their  corpses were carried to Sengakuji, and buried in front of the tomb of  their master, Asano Takumi no Kami. And when the fame of this became  noised abroad, the people flocked to pray at the graves of these  faithful men.    [Illustration: THE TOMBS OF THE RONINS.]    Among those who came to pray was a Satsuma man, who, prostrating  himself before the grave of Oishi Kuranosuke, said: \"When I saw you  lying drunk by the roadside at Yamashina, in Kioto, I knew not that  you were plotting to avenge your lord; and, thinking you to be a  faithless man, I trampled on you and spat in your face as I passed.  And now I have come to ask pardon and offer atonement for the insult  of last year.\" With those words he prostrated himself again before the  grave, and, drawing a dirk from his girdle, stabbed himself in the  belly and died. And the chief priest of the temple, taking pity upon  him, buried him by the side of the Ronins; and his tomb still remains  to be seen with those of the forty-seven comrades.    This is the end of the story of the forty-seven Ronins.           *       *       *       *       *    A terrible picture of fierce heroism which it is impossible not to  admire. In the Japanese mind this feeling of admiration is unmixed,  and hence it is that the forty-seven Ronins receive almost divine  honours. Pious hands still deck their graves with green boughs and  burn incense upon them; the clothes and arms which they wore are  preserved carefully in a fire-proof store-house attached to the  temple, and exhibited yearly to admiring crowds, who behold them  probably with little less veneration than is accorded to the relics of  Aix-la-Chapelle or Treves; and once in sixty years the monks of  Sengakuji reap quite a harvest for the good of their temple by holding  a commemorative fair or festival, to which the people flock during  nearly two months.    A silver key once admitted me to a private inspection of the relics.  We were ushered, my friend and myself, into a back apartment of the  spacious temple, overlooking one of those marvellous miniature  gardens, cunningly adorned with rockeries and dwarf trees, in which  the Japanese delight. One by one, carefully labelled and indexed boxes  containing the precious articles were brought out and opened by the  chief priest. Such a curious medley of old rags and scraps of metal  and wood! Home-made chain armour, composed of wads of leather secured  together by pieces of iron, bear witness to the secrecy with which the  Ronins made ready for the fight. To have bought armour would have  attracted attention, so they made it with their own hands. Old  moth-eaten surcoats, bits of helmets, three flutes, a writing-box that  must have been any age at the time of the tragedy, and is now tumbling  to pieces; tattered trousers of what once was rich silk brocade, now  all unravelled and befringed; scraps of leather, part of an old  gauntlet, crests and badges, bits of sword handles, spear-heads and  dirks, the latter all red with rust, but with certain patches more  deeply stained as if the fatal clots of blood were never to be blotted  out: all these were reverently shown to us. Among the confusion and  litter were a number of documents, Yellow with age and much worn at  the folds. One was a plan of Kotsuke no Suke's house, which one of  the Ronins obtained by marrying the daughter of the builder who  designed it. Three of the manuscripts appeared to me so curious that I  obtained leave to have copies taken of them.    The first is the receipt given by the retainers of Kotsuke no Suke's  son in return for the head of their lord's father, which the priests  restored to the family, and runs as follows:--      \"MEMORANDUM:--    ITEM. ONE HEAD.    ITEM. ONE PAPER PARCEL.    The above articles are acknowledged to have been received.                 Signed, {"]]]
