For evil, when once sanctioned by  governments, spreads in a tenfold degree, and may, unless seasonably  checked, become so ramified, as to affect the reputation of a country, and  to render its own removal scarcely possible without detriment to the  political concerns of the state. In no instance has this been verified more  than in the case of the Slave-trade. Never was our national character more  tarnished, and our prosperity more clouded by guilt. Never was there a  monster more difficult to subdue. Even they, who heard as it were the  shrieks of oppression, and wished to assist the sufferers, were fearful of  joining in their behalf. While they acknowledged the necessity of removing  one evil, they were terrified by the prospect of introducing another; and  were therefore only able to relieve their feelings, by lamenting in the  bitterness of their hearts, that this traffic had ever been begun at all.    After the death of cardinal Ximenes, the emperor Charles the Fifth, who had  come into power, encouraged the Slave-trade. In 1517 he granted a patent to  one of his Flemish favourites, containing an exclusive right of importing  four thousand Africans into America. But he lived long enough to repent of  what he had thus inconsiderately done. For in the year 1542 he made a code  of laws for the better protection of the unfortunate Indians in his foreign  dominions; and he stopped the progress of African slavery by an order, that  all slaves in his American islands should be made free. This order was  executed by Pedro de la Gasca. Manumission took place as well in Hispaniola  as on the Continent. But on the return of Gasca to Spain, and the  retirement of Charles into a monastery, slavery was revived.    It is impossible to pass over this instance of the abolition of slavery by  Charles in all his foreign dominions, without some comments. It shows him,  first, to have been a friend both to the Indians and the Africans, as a  part of the human race. It shows he was ignorant of what he was doing when  he gave his sanction to this cruel trade. It shows when legislators give  one set of men an undue power over another, how quickly they abuse it,--or  he never would have found himself obliged in the short space of twenty-five  years to undo that which he had countenanced as a great state-measure. And  while it confirms the former lesson to statesmen, of watching the  beginnings or principles of things in their political movements, it should  teach them never to persist in the support of evils, through the false  shame of being obliged to confess that they had once given them their  sanction, nor to delay the cure of them because, politically speaking,  neither this nor that is the proper season; but to do them away instantly,  as there can only be one fit or proper time in the eye of religion, namely,  on the conviction of their existence.    From the opinions of cardinal Ximenes and of the emperor Charles the Fifth,  I hasten to that which was expressed much about the same time, in a public  capacity, by pope Leo the Tenth. The Dominicans in Spanish America,  witnessing the cruel treatment which the slaves underwent there, considered  slavery as utterly repugnant to the principles of the gospel, and  recommended the abolition of it. The Franciscans did not favour the former  in this their scheme of benevolence; and the consequence was, that a  controversy on this subject sprung up between them, which was carried to  this pope for his decision. Leo exerted himself, much to his honour, in  behalf of the poor sufferers, and declared \"That not only the Christian  religion, but that Nature herself cried out against a state of slavery.\"  This answer was certainly worthy of one who was deemed the head of the  Christian church. It must, however, be confessed that it would have been  strange if Leo, in his situation as pontiff, had made a different reply. He  could never have denied that God was no respecter of persons. He must have  acknowledged that men were bound to love each other as brethren. And, if he  admitted the doctrine, that all men were accountable for their actions  hereafter, he could never have prevented the deduction, that it was  necessary they should be free. Nor could he, as a man of high attainments,  living early in the sixteenth century, have been ignorant of what had taken  place in the twelfth; or that, by the latter end of this latter century,  Christianity had obtained the undisputed honour of having extirpated  slavery from the western part of the European world.    From Spain and Italy I come to England. The first importation of slaves  from Africa by our countrymen was in the reign of Elizabeth, in the year  1562. This great princess seems on the very commencement of the trade to  have questioned its lawfulness. She seems to have entertained a religious  scruple concerning it, and, indeed, to have revolted at the very thought of  it. She seems to have been aware of the evils to which its continuance  might lead, or that, if it were sanctioned, the most unjustifiable means  might be made use of to procure the persons of the natives of Africa. And  in what light she would have viewed any acts of this kind, had they taken  place, we may conjecture from this fact,--that when captain (afterwards Sir  John) Hawkins returned from his first voyage to Africa and Hispaniola,  whither he had carried slaves, she sent for him, and, as we learn from  Hill's Naval History, expressed her concern lest any of the Africans should  be carried off without their free consent, declaring that \"It would be  detestable, and call down the vengeance of Heaven upon the undertakers.\"  Captain Hawkins promised to comply with the injunctions of Elizabeth in  this respect. But he did not keep his word; for when he went to Africa  again, he seized many of the inhabitants and carried them off as slaves,  which occasioned Hill, in the account he gives of his second voyage, to use  these remarkable words:--\"Here began the horrid practice of forcing the  Africans into slavery, an injustice and barbarity, which, so sure as there  is vengeance in heaven for the worst of crimes, will sometime be the  destruction of all who allow or encourage it.\" That the trade should have  been suffered to continue under such a princess, and after such solemn  expressions as those which she has been described to have uttered, can be  only attributed to the pains taken by those concerned in it to keep her  ignorant of the truth.    From England I now pass over to France. Labat, a Roman missionary, in his  account of the isles of America, mentions, that Louis the Thirteenth was  very uneasy when he was about to issue the edict, by which all Africans  coming into his colonies were to be made slaves, and that this uneasiness  continued, till he was assured, that the introduction of them in this  capacity into his foreign dominions was the readiest way of converting them  to the principles of the Christian religion.    These, then, were the first forerunners in the great cause of the abolition  of the Slave-trade. Nor have their services towards it been of small  moment. For, in the first place, they have enabled those, who came after  them, and who took an active interest in the same cause, to state the great  authority of their opinions and of their example. They have enabled them,  again, to detail the history connected with these, in consequence of which  circumstances have been laid open, which it is of great importance to know.  For have they not enabled them to state, that the African Slave-trade never  would have been permitted to exist but for the ignorance of those in  authority concerning it--That at its commencement there was a revolting of  nature against it--a suspicion--a caution--a fear--both as to its  unlawfulness and its effects? Have they not enabled them to state, that  falsehoods were advanced, and these concealed under the mask of religion,  to deceive those who had the power to suppress it? Have they not enabled  them to state that this trade began in piracy, and that it was continued  upon the principles of force? And, finally, have not they, who have been  enabled to make these statements, knowing all the circumstances connected  with them, found their own zeal increased and their own courage and  perseverance strengthened; and have they not, by the communication of them  to others, produced many friends and even labourers in the cause?          CHAPTER III.    _Forerunners continued to 1787--divided from this time into four  classes--First class consists principally of persons in Great Britain of  various description--Godwyn--Baxter--Tryon--Southern--Primatt--  Montesquieu--Hutcheson--Sharp--Ramsay--and a multitude of others, whose  names and services follow._      I have hitherto traced the history of the forerunners in this great cause  only up to about the year 1640. If I am to pursue my plan, I am to trace it  to the year 1787. But in order to show what I intend in a clearer point of  view, I shall divide those who have lived within this period, and who will  now consist of persons in a less elevated station, into four classes: and I  shall give to each class a distinct consideration by itself.    Several of our old English writers, though they have not mentioned the  African Slave-trade, or the slavery consequent upon it, in their respective  works, have yet given their testimony of condemnation against both. Thus  our great Milton:--      \"O execrable son, so to aspire    Above his brethren, to himself assuming    Authority usurpt, from God not given;    He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,    Dominion absolute; that right we hold    By his donation;--but man over men    He made not lord, such title to himself    Reserving, human left from human free.\"    I might mention bishop Saunderson and others, who bore a testimony equally  strong against the lawfulness of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],[0,"Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#5)"],[1,"and intimacy impossible before!  May the Christian believe  that this new sense of nearness and love to God is met by a  corresponding feeling on God's part?  In the light of Christian  experience is there not every reason to believe that God himself  also enters into a new and joyous relationship with the man?  This  thought was evidently in the mind of Jesus when be declared that  there was joy in heaven over one sinner that repented.      VI.    THE EFFECT OF SIN UPON SOCIETY.    Men are often heard to remark that they are willing to bear the  consequences of their sin.  Is it possible for any individual to  experience in himself the entire result of his wrong-doing?  In the  Genesis story the woman's deliberate disobedience would seem to  have had very direct influence upon her husband.  Mankind has  almost universally come to regard certain acts as wrong and to  prescribe definite modes of punishment.  Such decisions have come  about not simply because of the effect of sin upon the individual  but more especially because the sin of the individual affects  society.  State the different influences that deter men from sin  and note those which from your experience seem the strongest.      _Questions for Further Consideration_.    Is an act that is wrong for one man necessarily a sin if committed  by another?  Are men's tendencies to sin due to their inheritance  or to impulses which they share in common with brutes, or to  influences that come from their environment?  In the light of this  discussion formulate your own definition of sin.    Is the final test of sin a man's consciousness of guilt, or the  ultimate effect of his act upon himself, or upon society?    May the woman in the Garden of Eden be regarded as the prototype of  the modern scientist?  Are there ways in which the scientist may  sin in making his investigations?  Illustrate.  How about  vivisection?    Does sin bring moral enlightenment?  Distinguish between Jesus'  attitude toward sin and toward the sinner.  What should be our  attitude toward the sinner?    If the man and woman had frankly confessed their sin, what, by  implication, would have been the effect: first, upon themselves,  and second, upon the attitude and action of God?    Does temptation to sin, as in the case of Adam, often come in the  guise of virtue?  What is the value of confession to the sinner?  To society?      _Subjects for Further Study_.

THE STORY OF CAIN.--Gen. 4:1-16.    _Parallel Readings_.      _Hist. Bible_, Vol. 1, 42-46.    Jenks, _Prin. of Pol_. 1-16.    August Drahms, _The Criminal_.    Now in the course of time it came to pass, that Cain brought some  of the fruit of the ground as an offering to Jehovah.  And Abel  also brought some of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat.  And Jehovah looked favorably upon Abel and his offering: but for  Cain and his offering he had no regard.    Therefore, Cain was very angry and his countenance fell.  And  Jehovah said to Cain,      Why art thou angry?    And why is thy countenance fallen?    If thou doest well, is there not acceptance?    But if thou doest not well,    Does not sin crouch at the door?    And to thee shall be its desire,    But thou shouldst rule over it.    Then Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field.  And  while they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother  and slew him.    And when Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? he said,  I, know not; am I my brother's keeper.--Gen. 4:3-9 (_Hist. Bible_).    And the Scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery;  and having set her in the midst, they say unto Jesus, Teacher, this  woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.  Now in the law  Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?  And this they said trying him, that they might have whereof to  accuse him.  But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on  the ground.  And when they continued asking him, he lifted himself,  and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first  cast a stone at her.  And again he stooped down and with his finger  wrote on the ground.  And they, when they heard it, went out one by  one, beginning from the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was  left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.  And Jesus  lifted himself up and said unto her, Woman, where are they?  Did no  man condemn thee?  And she said, No man, Lord.  And Jesus said,  Neither do I condemn thee.  Go thy way; from henceforth sin no  more.--_John 8:3-11_.    Every experiment by multitudes or individuals that has a sensual or  selfish aim will fail.--_Emerson_.    When you meet one of these men or women be to them a Divine man; be  to them thought and virtue; let their timid aspirations find in you  a friend; let their trampled instincts be genially tempted out in  your atmosphere; let their doubts know that you have doubted, and  their wonder feel that you have wondered.--_Emerson_.    But I still have a good heart and believe in myself and fellow men  and the God who made us all.--_Robert Louis Stevenson_.      I.    THE MEANING OF THE STORY OF CAIN.    In Arabia and Palestine to-day, as in the past, a man's prosperity  or misfortune is universally regarded as the evidence of divine  approval or disapproval.  Even Jesus' disciples on seeing a blind  man by the wayside, raised the question: \"Did this man sin or his  parents?\"  Among the Arabs of the desert the tribal mark, either  tattooing or a distinctive way of cutting the hair, insures the  powerful protection of the tribe.  Each tribesman is under the most  sacred obligation to protect the life of a member of his tribe, or  to avenge, if need be with his own life-blood, every injury done  him.  Without the tribal mark a man becomes an outlaw.  Many  scholars, therefore, think that the mark placed upon Cain was not  primarily a stigma proclaiming his guilt, but rather a token that  protected him from violence at the hands of Jehovah's people and  compelled them to avenge any wrongs that might befall him.    In the light of these facts would it not seem possible that Cain's  character and conduct are the reason why his offering was not  accepted?    What is the meaning and purpose of Jehovah's question, Where is  Abel thy brother?  Is it probable that in the question, Am I my  brother's keeper, the writer intended to assert the responsibility  of society for the acts of its members?  In China where to-day, far  more than in the West, there exists the responsibility of  neighbors, those who fail to exert the proper influence over the  character and conduct of a criminal neighbor often have their  houses razed to the ground and the sites sown with salt.  Is  society responsible for producing criminals?  How far am I  personally responsible for my neighbor's acts?      II.    THE MAKING OF A CRIMINAL.    Paul said, \"All men have sinned.\"  Are all men therefore criminals?  What constitutes a criminal?  Was Cain a criminal before he slew  his brother?  Legally?  Morally?    Was Cain's motive in the worship of God truly religious or merely  mercenary?  This portrait of Cain illustrates the fact that formal  religious worship does not necessarily deter a man from becoming a  criminal.  Sometimes men prominent in religious work become  defaulters or commit other crimes.  Does this story suggest the  fundamental reason why great crimes are sometimes committed by  religious leaders?  The motive rather than the form is clearly the  one thing absolutely essential in religious worship.    Was the slaying of Abel the result simply of jealousy or a sudden  fit of anger or of a gradual deterioration of character?  Compare  the gradual development of the criminal instincts in Shakespeare's  Macbeth.  Think of the different influences tending to make  criminals!  Most criminals are made before they reach the age of  twenty-one.  The development of the criminal is the result either  of wrong education or the lack of right education.  Parents by  their failure to guard carefully their children's associates and to  develop in them habits of self-control, respect for the rights of  others, and a sense of social and civic obligation, are perhaps  more than any other class responsible for the growth of criminals.  In what ways does the State through its negligence also contribute  to the making of criminals?      III.    THE CRIMINAL'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS SOCIETY.    Every criminal act is anti-social.  Few if any criminals realize  this fact.  A superintendent of the Elmira Reformatory after years  of experience said that he had never seen a criminal who felt  remorse; while criminals usually regretted being caught, they  always excused their crime.  The criminal repudiates his social  obligations, not acknowledging the fact that the basis of all  society is the recognition of the rights of others.  The thief  often excuses his acts by asserting that society owes him a living.  Is this position right or do you agree with the following  statement?  \"The criterion of what is for the benefit of the  community at large must be settled by the community itself, not by  an individual.  The citizen, then, may and must do what the  community determines it is best for him to do; he must stand in the  forefront of battle if so ordered.  He must not do what the State  forbids; he may be deprived of liberty and life if he does.\"--  _Jenks_.      IV.    THE WAYS IN WHICH SOCIETY DEALS WITH THE CRIMINAL."]]]
