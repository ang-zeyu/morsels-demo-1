The villages were  surrounded by defensive walls such as were to be found about all  Tinguian villages until recent times, and which are still to be seen  about Abang and other settlements. Within the walls were many houses,  the descriptions of most of which would fit the dwellings of to  day. The one thing which seems foreign to present conditions is the  so-called \"ninth room\" which receives rather frequent mention. There  is nothing in the tales referring to buildings or house construction  which lends support to the contention of those who seek to class the  Tinguian as a modified sub-group of Igorot. [45] The Bontoc type of  dwelling with its ground floor sleeping box and its elevated one room  kitchen and storage room is nowhere mentioned, neither is there any  indication that in past or present times the Tinguian had separate  sleeping houses for the unmarried men and boys, and for the girls,  as do their neighbors to the south.    The other structures, such as the spirit houses, rice drying  frames, and granaries were similar to those seen to-day in all the  villages. Likewise the house furnishings, the musical instruments,  and even the games of the children were such as are to be found at  present, while our picture of the village life given on page 9 still  fits nearly any Tinguian settlement in Abra. The animals mentioned  are all familiar to the present people, but it is worthy of note  that in the first twenty-six tales, which make up the cycle proper,  the horse is not mentioned, nor does the carabao appear to be used  as a work animal. Still more important is the fact that the terraced  fields and the rice culture accompanying them, which to-day occupy  a predominant place in the economic life of the people, are nowhere  mentioned. On the other hand, the _langpadan_, or mountain rice,  assumes a place of great importance. References to the cultivation  of the land all seem to indicate that the \"hoe culture,\" which is  still practiced to a limited extent, took the place of agriculture.    The clothing, hair dressing, and ornaments, worn by these people,  agree closely with those of to-day. Beads seems to have been of  prime importance, but could scarcely have been more prized or more  used than at present. Unless she be in mourning, the hair and neck  of each woman are now ornamented with strings of beads, many of them  of evident antiquity, while strands above strands cover the arms from  the wrist to the elbow or even reach to the shoulder. [46]    The wealth of a person seems to have been, to a large extent,  determined by the number of old jars in his possession. As at the  present time, they formed the basis of settlement for feuds, as payment  for a bride, and even figured in the marriage ceremony itself. The  jars, as judged from their names, were evidently of ancient Chinese  manufacture, and possessed power of speech and motion similar to that  of human beings; but in a lesser measure the same type of jars have  similar powers to-day. [47]    The use of gold and jewels seems to have been common in the old times;  the latter are seldom seen in the district to-day, but the use of bits  of gold in the various ceremonies is still common, while earrings of  gold or copper are among the most prized possessions of the women. [48]  Placer mining is well known to the Igorot of the south, who melt and  cast the metal into various ornaments. So far as I am aware, this is  not practiced by the present Tinguian, but may point back to a time  when the industry was known in this region, or when trade relations  with the south were much freer than in recent years.    The weapons of the warriors, which we are specifically told were of  metal, are identical with those seen at the present time, while the  methods of warfare agree with the accounts still told by the old men  of their youthful exploits.    A survey of the tales brings out boldly the fact that a headhunt was  one of the most important events in Tinguian life. To-day stress of  circumstances has caused the custom to suffer a rapid decline, but  even now heads are occasionally taken, while most of the old men have  vivid recollections of the days when they fought \"in the towns of their  enemies.\" A spirited account of a head celebration seen in the village  of Lagangilang--from which ten of these tales were collected--will  be found in the writings of La Gironiere, already referred to. [49]  It is important to note that this account, as well as those secured  from many warriors of the present generation, offers some striking  differences to the procedure in the olden days, particularly as regards  the disposal of the skulls. The tales tell of the heads being placed  on the _sagang_ [50] at the spring, at the gate, or about the town,  after the celebration. Certain of the present villages make use of  the _sagang_, but the more common type of head holder is the _saloko_,  [51] which still figures in many ceremonies. However, the heads only  remain in these receptacles until the day set for the festival. They  are then carried to the centre of the village and there, amid  great rejoicing, are cut open; the brains are removed and to them  are added the lobes of the ears and joints of the little fingers,  and the whole is then placed in the liquor, which is served to the  dancers. Before the guests depart the skulls are broken into small  pieces and a fragment is presented to each male guest, who carries  it home and is thus often reminded of the valor of the takers. [52]  A study of Tinguian beliefs furnishes an additional religious motive  for the taking of heads, but with the people of Kadalayapan and  Kaodanan revenge and the desire for renown were the prime incentives.    Every tale emphasizes the importance of the _Sayang_ ceremony and  the spirit structure known as _balaua_. [53] The ceremony is nowhere  described in full, but the many details which are supplied show that  it was almost identical with that of to-day. The same is true of the  _Dawak_, [54] which we find mentioned on three different occasions, and  of the ceremony made to aid in locating lost or stolen articles. The  most noticeable fact, to the person familiar with Tinguian life,  is that these are the only ceremonies mentioned among the many known  and practiced at present. More than a score of different rites are  now well known to this people, and occupy a very considerable portion  of their time and attention during the first four months of the year.    The failure to make mention of these very important events is  explained, it seems to me, not by their absence, but by the fact that  these rites vary in importance and that the privilege of celebrating  them is hereditary in a family. Should one not entitled to hold  such a ceremony desire to do so, he must first give, in order, all  the lesser events, a costly procedure extending over a period of  several years. The people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan always appear  as being closely related to the spirit Kaboniyan, [55] and exceedingly  powerful. It seems probable that the story teller takes it for granted  that all of them are entitled to hold the most important ceremony  known to the Tinguian.    A prominent figure in these rites is the medium, through whom the  ancient people generally conversed with the spirits, but in exceptional  cases we found the heroes talking direct with the superior beings;  however, this gift is not confined to the men of old, for in such  tales as 55 and 59 people who are believed to have lived recently  have conversed with the spirits and have even been joined to them  in marriage.    The procedure in choosing a bride, the engagement, the _pakalon_,  [56] and the marriage proper are all those of the present day, but the  rules governing the marriage of relatives differ radically. As already  noted, one of the chief qualifications for marriage, among the people  of the tales, was relationship, and even cousins became husband and  wife. Such a thing is unthinkable among the Tinguian of to-day; first  cousins are absolutely barred from marrying, while even the union of  second cousins would cause a scandal, and it is very doubtful if such a  wife would be allowed to share in her deceased husband's property. [57]    It appears that only one real [58] wife is recognized as legitimate,  but that from \"the first times\" to the present a man might have as  many concubines as he could secure.    So far as mythology and present day conditions can inform us the bride  has always gone to the home of her husband and, for a time at least,  has been subject to the dictations of her mother-in-law, although the  couple are generally soon established in a home of their own, in the  town of the groom. There is nothing in Tinguian life or tradition to  indicate that they have ever had a clan system or a matriarchal form  of government.    The few references to the procedure immediately after a death indicate  that, in part, the people of to-day follow the old custom; but here  again an important departure occurs. We are thrice told that the  corpse was placed on a little raft called _tabalang_ and set adrift  on the river; and in one case the afterbirth was treated in the same  manner. Nothing of the sort is done to-day, nor does it seem at all  likely that such has been the case in recent generations. The body  is now buried beneath the house, and certain set rules govern the  movements of all persons related to the deceased, as well as the  disposal of the corpse. This procedure is so complex and so uniform  throughout the whole Tinguian belt that it seems improbable that it  has grown up, except through a long period of time. At this point  it is interesting to note that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12551"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 19, No. 541, April (#5)"],[1,"it overhung the upper part of his face, and  together with its ends, which flapped over each cheek, hid nearly the  whole of his countenance from view; his tobe and trousers were made  exactly in the same fashion as those of a man, and two large belts of blue  cotton, which crossed each other, confined the tobe to his body. The  little legs of the child were swallowed up in clumsy yellow boots, big  enough for his father; and though he was rather pretty, his whimsical  dress gave him altogether so odd an appearance, that he might have been  taken for anything but what he really was. A few of the women on the  ground by the side of the king wore large white dresses, which covered  their persons like a winding-sheet. Young virgins, according to custom,  appeared in a state of nudity; many of them had wild flowers stuck behind  their ears, and strings of beads, &c., round their loins; but want of  clothing did not seem to damp their pleasure in the entertainment, for  they appeared to enter into it with as much zest as any of their  companions. Of the different coloured tobes worn by the men, none looked  so well as those of a deep crimson colour on some of the horsemen; but the  clean white tobes of the Mohammedan priests, of whom not less than a  hundred were present on the occasion, were extremely neat and becoming.  The sport terminated without the slightest accident, and the king's  dismounting was a signal for the people to disperse.    \"We have here endeavoured, to the best of our ability, to describe an  African horse-race, but it is impossible to convey a correct idea of the  singular and fantastic appearance of the numerous groups of people that  met our view on all sides, or to describe their animation and delight; the  martial equipment of the soldiers and their noble steeds, and the wild,  romantic, and overpowering interest of the whole mass.

HAYDON'S EXHIBITION.      Mr. Haydon has completed his _Xenophon_ and _the_ 10,000 _first seeing the  Sea from Mount Theches_--a brilliantly glowing page of Grecian heroism,  and a splendid specimen of the highest order of historical painting. It  represents the celebrated retreat of the 10,000 valorous Greeks, with  Xenophon at their head, whose only hope of release from one of the most  perilous situations--was to reach the sea. The action of the picture is  thus described by the artist:    \"This, of course, was accepted--they altered their course, and, while the  army was in full march over Mount Theches, the advanced guard, in coming  to the top, came suddenly in view of a magnificent valley, with the SEA in  the extreme distance, glittering along an extended coast, and mingling  with the hazy horizon!    \"The whole guard burst out into a furious shout of enthusiastic exultation  the SEA! the SEA! was echoed along the whole army, below in the passes;  Xenophon, from the uproar, thinking they were attacked, galloped forward  with the cavalry;[1] but seeing the cause, joined in the shout! The  feeling was too powerful to be resisted--men, women, and children, the  veteran, the youth, the officer, the private, beasts of burden, cattle,  and horses, broke up like a torrent that had burst a mountain rock, and  rushed, headlong to the summit!    \"As each, in succession, lifted his head up above the rocks, and really  saw the SEA, nothing could exceed the affecting display of gratitude and  enthusiastic rapture!--some embraced, some cried like children, some  stamped like madmen, some fell on their knees and thanked the gods, others  were mute with gratitude, and stared as if bewildered!    \"Never was such a scene seen! as soon as the soldiers recovered something  like reason, a trophy on a heap of stones and shields, was erected. The  army descended the Colchian Mountains, and reached Trapezus, the modern  Trebizon, after a march of 1,155 leagues, during two hundred and fifteen  days, where they embarked for their native country.    \"The moment I have taken is when Xenophon seeing the sea has rode forward  to shout it to the army. He is waving his helmet with one hand, and  pointing to the sea with the other, mounted on a skew-bald charger.    \"Below the army are rushing up--in the centre is an officer, on a blood  Arab, carrying his wife. A veteran soldier on his left is supporting an  exhausted youth who has sunk on his shield, and pointing out the path to  the army. On the right, is a young man carrying up on his back his aged  father who has lost his helmet--the trumpeter lower down, is blowing a  blast to collect the rear guard which are mounting behind him, while near  the mare's head is the Greek band with trumpets and cymbals encouraging  the men. The army is rushing up under an opening of the rock to the left,  while the advanced guard of cavalry are trotting down the shelving top of  a precipice, the horses excited and snuffing up the sea air with ecstasy.\"    It would, however, be difficult to convey, by description, the  overpowering energy and mighty struggle of the scene before us, or the  masterly skill with which the painter has brought within a few square feet  of canvass, one of the most astounding events in the history of man. Its  moral tendency should be a lasting lesson of the secret spring of  honourable success in life--decision of character and well-directed  energies to accomplish great ends--though applicable to every station of  life, however humble.    Xenophon is a distant figure in this effective picture: his action, as  well as that of the cavalry, about him is admirably expressed: he appears  on the pinnacle of triumph; his charger snuffs the very gale of glory, and  the uncurbed energy of exultation seems to animate those immediately  around him. The eye descends to the checkered toil beneath: the brawny  soldier bearing the delicate form of his lovely wife, which is well  contrasted with the bold, muscular figure of the former: the exhausted  youth, and the veteran directing the army, but especially the former, are  finely drawn and painted: the bare head of the aged man, with his few last  locks fluttering in the wind, contrasts with the burly-headed trumpeter,  whose thick throat and outblown cheeks denote the energy which he is  throwing into this last inspiring call to victory over difficulty. The  head of the soldier's blood Arab is one of the finest studies of the group:  you almost see the breath of his nostrils; the hinder parts and tail of  the horse are not quite of equal merit. These are but a few of the points  of excellence in the picture: its colouring is censurable for its  roughness, especially by those who enjoy the smoothly-finished productions  of certain British artists; but we may look to such in vain for the  powerful drawing and forcible expression which characterize this, the  finest of Mr. Haydon's pictures.    In the same room, _vis a vis_ the _Xenophon_, is the _Mock Election_  picture described at some length in No. 304, of _The Mirror_. About the  walls are thirteen finished sketches and studies also by Mr. Haydon. We  may notice them anon.

An exhibition of paintings in enamel colours on glass has been opened at  No. 357, Strand, which is likely to prove attractive to the patrons of art  as well as to the sight-seeing public. It consists of faithful copies of  Harlow's _Kemble Family;_ Martin's _Belshazzar_, _Joshua_, and _Love among  the Roses;_ Sir Joshua Reynolds's celebrated group of _Charity_, and a  tasteful composition of a _Vase of Flowers with fruit_, &c. The whole are  ably executed, and calculated to advance the art of painting on glass to  its olden eminence. The copies from Martin are of the size of his prints,  and are perhaps the most successful: that of _Joshua commanding the Sun to  stand still_ is powerfully striking: the supernal light breaking from the  dense panoply of clouds is admirably executed, and the minuteness of the  architectural details and the fighting myriads is indescribable. In the  Hall of _Belshazzar_, the perspective is ably preserved throughout, though  the interest of the picture is not of that intense character that we  recognise in _Joshua_. The painting of the Trial of Queen Katherine is of  the size of Clint's masterly print: it required greater delicacy in  copying than did either of its companion pictures, since it has few of the  strong lights and vivid contrasts so requisite for complete success on  glass. The costumes are well managed, as the red of Wolsey's robes, and  the massy velvet dress of Katherine. Of this print, by the way, there are  appended to the Catalogue a few particulars which may be new and pleasant  to the reader. Thus:--    \"The Picture is on mahogany panel, 1-1/2 inch in thickness, and in size,  about 7 feet by 5 feet. It originated with Mr. T. Welsh, the meritorious  professor of music, in whose possession the picture remains. This  gentleman commissioned Harlow to paint for him a kit-cat size portrait of  Mrs. Siddons, in the character of Queen Katherine in Shakspeare's Play of  Henry VIII., introducing a few of the scenic accessories in the distance.  For this portrait Harlow was to receive twenty-five guineas; but the idea  of representing the whole scene occurred to the artist, who, with Mr.  Welsh, prevailed upon most of the actors to sit for their portraits: in  addition to these, are introduced portraits of the friends of both parties,  including the artist himself. The sum ultimately paid by Mr. Welsh was one  hundred guineas; and a like sum was paid by Mr. Cribb, for Harlow's  permission to engrave the well-known print, to which we have already  adverted. The panel upon which the picture is painted, is stated to have  cost the"]]]
