Crows with sticks and  feathers in their mouths are flying about all day.    \"Dec. 5, 1878. Aroli.--Found a nest with a Crow sitting in it; no one  to climb the tree.\"    Mr. Benjamin Aitken has favoured me with the following interesting  note:--\"I send you an account of a nest of the Common Crow, found in  October, 1874, in the town of Madras. My attention was first directed  to the remarkable pair of Crows to which the nest belonged, in the end  of July, when they were determinedly and industriously attempting to  fix a nest on the top ledge of a pillar in the verandah of the 'Madras  Mail' office. The ledge was so narrow that one would have thought the  Sparrow alone of all known birds would have selected it for a site;  and even the Sparrow only under the condition of a writing or  toilet-table being underneath to catch the lime, sticks, straws, rags,  feathers, and other innumerable materials that commonly strew the  ground below a Sparrow's nest. I was told that the Crows had been at  their task for two months before I saw them, and I then watched them  till nearly the end of October. The celebrated spider that taught King  Bruce a lesson in patience was eager and fitful compared with this  pair of Crows. I kept no account of the number of times their  structure was blown down, only to be immediately begun again; but as  there was a good deal of rain and wind at that season, in addition to  the regular sea-breeze, it was a common thing for the sticks to be  cleared off day after day. But perseverance will often achieve seeming  impossibilities, and, moreover, the Crows worked more indefatigably as  the season went on, and used to run up their nest with great rapidity  (no doubt, also, they improved by their practice); so that several  times the structure was completed, or nearly completed, before being  swept to the ground, though how it remained in its place for a moment  seems a mystery; and twice I saw a broken egg among the scattered  _debris_. At length, about the middle of September, the Crows  determined to try the pillar at the other end of the verandah. By this  time, of course, all the Crows in Madras had long brought up their  broods and sent them adrift; and what they thought to see an eccentric  pair of their own species forsaking society, and _building_ in  September, may be imagined. The new site selected differed in no  respect from the old one, and was no less exposed to the wind; but the  birds had grown expert at building 'castles in the air,' and now met  with fewer mishaps. In the first week of October the hen bird was  sitting regularly, so on the 8th of the month I sent a man up by a  ladder, and he held up four eggs for me to look at. It fairly seemed  after this that patience was to have its reward, but on the night of  the 20th there came a storm of wind and rain, and when I went to the  office in the morning, the nest was lying on the ground, with two  young Crows in it, with the feathers just beginning to appear. The  other two, I suppose, had fallen over into the street. And thus  ended one of the most persevering attempts on record to overcome a  difficulty insurmountable from the first. The old birds thought it  time now to stop operations, and frequented the office no more.    \"I am told by a gentleman in the 'Mail' office that the Crows have  built in that verandah regularly for five or six years past, but  nobody seems to have watched the nests. I am, therefore, hopeful that  the attempt will be repeated this year, in which case I will keep a  diary of all that takes place.\"    He writes subsequently:--\"I sent you a long story in my last batch of  notes about two eccentric Crows that succeeded in building a nest upon  the narrow ledge of a pillar in the verandah of my office, several  months after all well-conducted Crows had sent out their progeny to  battle with the world. I mentioned to you that they were said to build  in that unnatural place every year, and I said that I would watch them  this year.    \"Well, would you believe it? on the 26th July, when every other Crow's  nest in Madras had hard-set eggs, or newly-hatched young ones, these  two indefatigable birds set methodically to work to construct a nest  on the south pillar--the one where all their earlier efforts were made  last year, but not the one on which they succeeded in fixing their  nest. They worked all the 26th and 27th, putting up sticks as fast as  they fell down, and then desisted till the 4th August, when they began  operations on the opposite (north) pillar with redoubled energy.  Meeting with no better success they left off operations after a couple  of days' fruitless labour. Yesterday (after a delay of five weeks)  they set to work on the south pillar again and succeeded in raising  a great pile, which, however, was ignominiously blown down in the  afternoon. To-day they are continuing their work indefatigably.\"    Mr. J.E. Cripps has the following note in his list of birds of  Furreedpore, Eastern Bengal:--\"Very common, and a permanent resident,  affecting the haunts of man. They build and lay in May. The Koel lays  its eggs in this bird's nest. In April, 1876, I saw two nests in the  compound of the house in which I lived at Howrah, which were made  _entirely_ of galvanized wire, the thickest piece of which was as  thick as a slate pencil. How the birds managed to bend these thick  pieces of wire was a marvel to us; not a stick was incorporated with  the wires, and the lining of the nest (which was of the ordinary  size) was jute and a few feathers. The railway goods-yard, which was  alongside the house, supplied the wire, of which there was ever so  much lying about there.\"    Typically the eggs may, I think, be said to be rather broad ovals, a  good deal pointed towards the small end; but really the eggs vary so  much in shape that, even with nearly two hundred before me, it is  difficult to decide what is really the most typical form. Pyriform,  elongated, and globular varieties are common; long Cormorant-shaped  eggs and perfect ovals are not uncommon. As regards the colour of the  ground, and colour, character, and extent of marking, all that I have  above said of the Raven's eggs applies to those of this species, but  varieties occur amongst those of the latter which I have not observed  in those of the former. In some the ground is a very pale pure  bluish green, in others it is dingier and greener. All are blotched,  speckled, and streaked more or less with somewhat pale sepia markings;  but in some the spots and specks are a darker brown and, as a rule,  well defined, and there is very little streaking, while in others the  brown is pale and muddy, the markings ill-defined, and nearly the  whole surface of the egg is freckled over with smudgy streaks.  Sometimes the markings are most numerous at the large end, sometimes  at the small; no two eggs are exactly alike, and yet they have so  strong a family resemblance that there is no possibility of mistaking  them. Generally the markings as a whole are less bold, and the general  colour of a large body of them laid together is bluer and brighter  than that of a similar drawer-full of Ravens' eggs. As a whole, too,  they are more glossy. I have one egg before me bright blue and almost  as glossy as a Mynah's, thickly blotched and speckled at the broad  end, and thinly spotted elsewhere with olive-green, blackish-brown,  and pale purple. Another egg, a pale pure blue, is spotless, except  at the large end, where there is a conspicuous cap of olive-brown and  olive-green spots and speckles, and there are numerous other abnormal  varieties which I have not observed amongst the Ravens.    On the whole the eggs do _not_ vary much in size; out of one hundred  and ninety-seven, one hundred and ninety-five varied between 1.28 and  1.65 in length, and 0.98 and 1.15 in breadth. One egg measures only  1.2 in length, and one is only 0.96 in breadth; but the average of the  whole is 1.44 by 1.06.      8. Corvus insolens, Hume. _The Burmese House-Crow_.    Corvus insolens; _Hume; Hume, Cat._ no. 663 bis.    The Burmese House-Crow breeds pretty well over the whole of Burma.    Mr. Oates, writing from Pegu, says:--\"Nesting operations are  commenced about the 20th March. The nest and eggs require no  separate description, for both appear to be similar to those of _C.  splendens_.\"    When large series of the eggs of both these species are compared,  those of the Burmese Crow strike one as _averaging_ somewhat brighter  coloured, otherwise they are precisely alike and need no separate  description.      9.

I only know positively of Jackdaws breeding in one district within our  limits, viz. Cashmere; but I have seen it in the hills in summer, as  far east as the Valley of the Beas, and it must breed everywhere in  suitable localities between the two.    In the cold season of course the Jackdaw descends into the plains of  the North-west Punjaub, is very numerous near the foot of the hills,  and has been found in cis-Indus as far east as Umballa, and south at  Ferozpoor, Jhelum, and Kalabagh. In Trans-Indus it extends unto the  Dehra Ghazi Khan district.    I have never taken its eggs myself.    Mr. W. Theobald makes the following remarks on its nidification in the  Valley of Cashmere:--    \"Lays in the first week of May; eggs four, five, and six in number,  ovato-pyriform and long ovato-pyriform, measuring from 1.26, 1.45, to  1.60 in length, and from 0.9 to 1.00 in breadth; colour pale,  clear bluish green, dotted and spotted with brownish black; valley  generally; in holes of rocks, beneath roofs, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13119"],[0,"Jean François Millet (#5)"],[1,"is a hook, from which a  lamp is suspended by a chain. This lamp appears to be a boat-shaped  vessel with the wick coming out at one end. The light gilds the  mother's gentle profile with shining radiance; it illumines the  fingers of her right hand, and gleams on the coarse garment in her  lap, transforming it into a cloth of gold.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. THE WOMAN  SEWING BY LAMPLIGHT John Andrew & Son, Sc.]    The baby meanwhile lies on the other side of the lamp in the shadow.  His little mouth is open, and he is fast asleep. We can almost fancy  that the mother croons a lullaby as she sews. There is a pathetic  little French song called La Petite Helene, which Millet's mother used  to sing to him, and which he in turn taught his own children. Perhaps  we could not understand the words if we could hear it. But when  mothers sing to their babies, whatever the tongue in which they speak,  they use a common language of motherhood. Some such simple little  lullaby as this, which mothers of another land sing to their babes,  would doubtless interpret this mother's thoughts:--      \"Sleep, baby, sleep!    Thy father watches the sheep;    Thy mother is shaking the dreamland tree,    And down comes a little dream on thee.    Sleep, baby, sleep!      \"Sleep, baby, sleep!    The large stars are the sheep;    The little ones are the lambs, I guess:    The gentle moon is the shepherdess,    Sleep, baby, sleep!      \"Sleep, baby, sleep!    Our Saviour loves his sheep;    He is the Lamb of God on high    Who for our sakes came down to die.    Sleep, baby, sleep!\"    When we remember that the ancient Romans had lamps constructed  somewhat like that in the picture, it seems strange that so rude a  contrivance should be in use in the nineteenth century. But this is  only the practical and prosaic side of the question. For artistic  purposes the lamp is just what is wanted in the composition.    You can see how a lamp with a glass chimney and shade would spoil the  whole effect. We should lose that strange beautiful halo surrounding  the wick, and the light would fall only on the work, instead of  glorifying the face of the mother. These wonderful impressions of  light add much to the artistic beauty of the picture, and explain why  artists have so greatly admired it.    The picture naturally recalls that other Mother and Babe, Mary of  Nazareth and the holy Child Jesus, who for so many centuries have  inspired the imagination of artists. Often a painter has drawn his  first conception for this sacred subject from some peasant mother and  child such as these.    In order to give religious significance to their pictures, artists  have tried in many ways to suggest the supernatural. They have  introduced halos about the heads of Mary and Jesus, and have made  the light seem to shine mysteriously from the child's body. Now our  painter Millet, representing only an ordinary mother and babe, has  not used any such methods. Nevertheless, without going beyond strict  reality, he has produced a mystical effect of light which makes this  picture worthy of a place among the Madonnas. The glow of the lamp  transforms the familiar scene into a shrine of mother's love.          V    THE SHEPHERDESS      Many years ago the early English poet, Sir Philip Sidney, wrote a book  about an imaginary country called Arcadia, noted for the sweetness  of the air and the gentle manners of the people. As he described the  beauties of the scenery there, he told of \"meadows enamelled with all  sorts of eye-pleasing flowers; each pasture stored with sheep feeding  with sober security; here a shepherd's boy piping as though he should  never be old; there a young shepherdess knitting and withal singing,  and it seemed that her voice comforted her hands to work, and her  hands kept time to her voice-music.\"    We could easily fancy that our picture of the Shepherdess was meant  to illustrate a scene in Arcadia. Here is the meadow \"enamelled with  eye-pleasing flowers,\" the sheep \"feeding with sober security,\" and  the young shepherdess herself knitting. Though she is not singing with  her lips, her heart sings softly as she knits, and her hands keep time  to the dream-music.    Early in the morning she led her flock out to the fallow pastures  which make good grazing ground. All day long the sheep have nibbled  the green herbage at their own sweet will, always under the watchful  eye of their gentle guardian. Her hands have been busy all the time.  Like patient Griselda in Chaucer's poem, who did her spinning while  she watched her sheep, \"she would not have been idle till she slept.\"  Ever since she learned at her mother's knee those early lessons in  knitting, she has kept the needles flying. She can knit perfectly well  now while she follows her flock about. The work almost knits itself  while her eyes and thoughts are engaged in other occupations.    The little shepherdess has an assistant too, who shares the  responsibilities of her task. He is a small black dog, \"patient and  full of importance and grand in the pride of his instinct.\"[1] When a  sheep is tempted by an enticing bit of green in the distance to stray  from its companions, the dog quickly bounds after the runaway and  drives it back to the flock. Only the voice of the shepherdess is  needed to send him hither, thither, and yon on such errands.    Now nightfall comes, and it is time to lead the flock home to the  sheepfold. The sheep are gathered into a compact mass, the ram in  their midst. The shepherdess leads the way, and the dog remains at  the rear, \"walking from side to side with a lordly air,\" to allow no  wanderer to escape.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. John Andrew  & Son, Sc. THE SHEPHERDESS]    Their way lies across the plain whose level stretch is unbroken by  fences or buildings. In the distance men may be seen loading a wagon  with hay. The sheep still keep on nibbling as they go, and their  progress is slow. The shepherdess takes time to stop and rest now and  then, propping her staff in front of her while she picks up a stitch  dropped in her knitting. There is a sense of perfect stillness in the  air, that calm silence of the fields, which Millet once said was the  gayest thing he knew in nature.    The chill of nightfall is beginning to be felt, and the shepherdess  wears a hood and cape. Her face shows her to be a dreamer. These  long days in the open air give her many visions to dream of. Her  companionship with dumb creatures makes her more thoughtful, perhaps,  than many girls of her age.    As a good shepherdess she knows her sheep well enough to call them all  by name. From their soft wool was woven her warm cape and hood, and  there is a genuine friendship between flock and mistress. When she  goes before them, they follow her, for they know her voice.    Among the traditions dear to the hearts of the French people is one of  a saintly young shepherdess of Nanterre, known as Ste. Genevieve. Like  the shepherdess of our picture, she was a dreamer, and her strange  visions and wonderful sanctity set her apart from childhood for a  great destiny. She grew up to be the saviour of Paris, and to-day her  name is honored in a fine church dedicated to her memory. It was the  crowning honor of Millet's life that he was commissioned to paint on  the walls of this church scenes from the life of Ste. Genevieve. He  did not live to do the work, but one cannot help believing that his  ideals of the maiden of Nanterre must have taken some such shape as  this picture of the Shepherdess.    In the painting from which our illustration is reproduced, the colors  are rich and glowing. The girl's dress is blue and her cap a bright  red. The light shining on her cloak turns it a rich golden brown.  Earth and sky are glorified by the beautiful sunset light.    As we look across the plain, the earth seems to stretch away on every  side into infinite distance. We are carried out of ourselves into the  boundless liberty of God's great world. \"The still small voice of the  level twilight\" speaks to us out of the \"calm and luminous distance.\"    Ruskin has sought to explain the strange attractive power which  luminous space has for us. \"There is one thing that it has, or  suggests,\" he says, \"which no other object of sight suggests in equal  degree, and that is,--Infinity. It is of all visible things the least  material, the least finite, the farthest withdrawn from the earth  prison-house, the most typical of the nature of God, the most  suggestive of the glory of his dwelling place.\"[2]      [Footnote 1: Like the watchdog described in Longfellow's _Evangeline_,  Part II.]    [Footnote 2: In _Modern Painters_, in chapter on \"Infinity,\" from  which also the other quotations are drawn.]          VI    THE WOMAN FEEDING HENS      In walking through a French village, we get as little idea of the home  life of the people as if we were in a large town or city. The houses  usually border directly upon the street, and the spaces between are  closed with high walls, shutting in the thoroughfare as completely as  in a city \"block.\" Behind these barriers each family carries on its  domestic affairs in the privacy of its own domain. The _cour_, or  dooryard, is the enclosure adjoining the house, and is surrounded on  all sides by buildings or walls. Beyond this the more prosperous have  also a garden or orchard, likewise surrounded by high walls.    In the dooryard are performed many of the duties both of the barn and  the house. Here the cows are milked, the horses groomed, the sheep  sheared, and the poultry fed. Here, too, is the children's playground,  safe from the dangers of the street, and within hearing of the  mother's voice.    It is into such a dooryard that we seem to be looking in this picture  of The Woman Feeding Hens. It is a common enough little house which  we see, built of stone, plastered over, in the"]]]
