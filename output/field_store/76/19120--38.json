The bustard (_Otis tarda_,) observes Graves in his _British Ornithology_,  \"was formerly seen in the downs and heaths of various parts of our island,  in flocks of forty or fifty birds; whereas it is now a circumstance of  rare occurrence to meet with a single individual.\" Bewick also remarks,  \"that they were formerly more common in this island than at present; they  are now found only in the open counties of the south and east, in the  plains of Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and some parts of Yorkshire.\" In the few  years that have elapsed since Bewick wrote, this bird has entirely  disappeared from Wiltshire and Dorsetshire.    These changes, we may observe, are derived from very imperfect memorials,  and relate only to the larger and more conspicuous animals inhabiting a  small spot on the globe; but they cannot fail to exalt our conception of  the enormous revolutions which, in the course of several thousand years,  the whole human species must have effected.    The kangaroo and the emu are retreating rapidly before the progress of  colonization in Australia; and it scarcely admits of doubt, that the  general cultivation of that country must lead to the extirpation of both.  The most striking example of the loss, even within the last two centuries,  of a remarkable species, is that of the dodo--a bird first seen by the  Dutch when they landed on the Isle of France, at that time uninhabited,  immediately after the discovery of the passage to the East Indies by the  Cape of Good Hope. It was of a large size and singular form; its wings  short, like those of an ostrich, and wholly incapable of sustaining its  heavy body even for a short flight. In its general appearance it differed  from the ostrich, cassowary, or any known bird.    Many naturalists gave figures of the dodo after the commencement of the  seventeenth century; and there is a painting of it in the British Museum,  which is said to have been taken from a living individual. Beneath the  painting is a leg, in a fine state of preservation, which ornithologists  are agreed cannot belong to any other known bird. In the museum at Oxford,  also, there is a foot and a head, in an imperfect state, but M. Cuvier  doubts the identy of this species with that of which the painting is  preserved in London.    In spite of the most active search, during the last century, no  information respecting the dodo was obtained, and some authors have gone  so far as to pretend that it never existed; but amongst a great mass of  satisfactory evidence in favour of the recent existence of this species,  we may mention that an assemblage of fossil bones were recently discovered,  under a bed of lava, in the Isle of France, and sent to the Paris museum  by M. Desjardins. They almost all belonged to a large living species of  land-tortoise, called _Testudu Indica_, but amongst them were the head,  sternum, and humerus of the dodo. M. Cuvier showed me these valuable  remains in Paris, and assured me that they left no doubt in his mind that  the huge bird was one of the gallinaceous tribe.    Next to the direct agency of man, his indirect influence in multiplying  the numbers of large herbivorous quadrupeds of domesticated races, may be  regarded as one of the most obviate causes of the extermination of species.  On this, and on several other grounds, the introduction of the horse, ox,  and other mammalia, into America, and their rapid propagation over that  continent within the last three centuries, is a fact of great importance  in natural history. The extraordinary herds of wild cattle and horses  which overran the plains of South America, sprang from a very few pairs  first carried over by the Spaniards; and they prove that the wide  geographical range of large species in great continents does not  necessarily imply that they have existed there from remote periods.  Humboldt observes, in his Travels, on the authority of Azara, that it is  believed there exist, in the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, twelve million cows  and three million horses, without comprising in this enumeration the  cattle that have no acknowledged proprietor. In the Llanos of Caraccas,  the rich hateros, or proprietors of pastoral farms, are entirely ignorant  of the number of cattle they possess. The young are branded with a mark  peculiar to each herd, and some of the most wealthy owners mark as many as  fourteen thousand a year. In the northern plains, from the Orinoco to the  lake of Maracaybo, M. Depons reckoned that one million two hundred  thousand oxen, one hundred and eighty thousand horses, and ninety thousand  mules, wandered at large. In some parts of the valley of the Mississippi,  especially in the country of the Osage Indians, wild horses are immensely  numerous.    The establishment of black cattle in America dates from Columbus's second  voyage to St. Domingo. They there multiplied rapidly; and that island  presently became a kind of nursery from which these animals were  successively transported to various parts of the continental coast, and  from thence into the interior. Notwithstanding these numerous exportations,  in twenty-seven years after the discovery of the island, herds of four  thousand head, as we learn from Oviedo, were not uncommon, and there were  even some that amounted to eight thousand. In 1587, the number of hides  exported from St. Domingo alone, according to Acosta's report, was  thirty-five thousand four hundred and forty-four; and in the same year  there were exported sixty-four thousand three hundred and fifty from the  ports of New Spain. This was in the sixty-fifth year after the taking of  Mexico, previous to which event the Spaniards, who came into that country,  had not been able to engage in any thing else than war. All our readers  are aware that these animals are now established throughout the American  continent, from Canada to Paraguay.    The ass has thriven very generally in the New World; and we learn from  Ulloa, that in Quito they ran wild, and multiplied in amazing numbers, so  as to become a nuisance. They grazed together in herds, and, when attacked,  defended themselves with their mouths. If a horse happened to stray into  the places where they fed, they all fell upon him, and did not cease  biting and kicking till they left him dead.    The first hogs were carried to America by Columbus, and established in the  island of St. Domingo the year following its discovery in November, 1493.  In succeeding years they were introduced into other places where the  Spaniards settled; and, in the space of half a century, they were found  established in the New World, from the latitude of 25 deg. north, to the  40th deg. of south latitude. Sheep, also, and goats have multiplied  enormously in the New World, as have also the cat and the rat, which last,  as we before stated, has been imported unintentionally in ships. The dogs  introduced by man, which have at different periods become wild in America,  hunted in packs like the wolf and the jackal, destroying not only hogs,  but the calves and foals of the wild cattle and horses.    Ulloa in his voyage, and Buffon on the authority of old writers, relate a  fact which illustrates very clearly the principle before explained by us,  of the check which the increase of one animal necessarily offers to that  of another. The Spaniards had introduced goats into the island of Juan  Fernandez, where they became so prolific as to furnish the pirates who  infested those seas with provisions. In order to cut off this resource  from the bucaneers, a number of dogs were turned loose into the island;  and so numerous did they become in their turn, that they destroyed the  goats in every accessible part, after which the number of the wild dogs  again decreased.    As an example of the rapidity with which a large tract may become peopled  by the offspring of a single pair of quadrupeds, we may mention that in  the year 1773, thirteen rein-deer were exported from Norway, only three of  which reached Iceland. These were turned loose into the mountains of  Guldbringe Syssel, where they multiplied so greatly, in the course of  forty years, that it was not uncommon to meet with herds consisting of  from forty to one hundred in various districts.--_Lyell's Geology_, vol.  ii.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NOVELIST.           *       *       *       *       *    THE CONFESSION OF SERVENTIUS.    (_Concluded from page 46_.)      That evening, Father Dominick, our excellent priest, and my tutor in the  classics, was closeted for a length of time with my afflicted nominal  parents; and two days afterwards taking me with him to his monastery, he  introduced me to the superior, as an orphan, the child of dear and  particular friends, confided by them to his charge for education upon  their death-bed, and with a distinct understanding that I was not bound to  take upon myself monastic vows, the superior allowed me to remain with him  as a boarder. Serventius and Artemisia I never more beheld, and every  inquiry respecting them which I ventured to make of Father Dominick, was  checked with a strange, sad look, and an admonition to mention them no  more. Seven long and peaceful years, I spent in the monastery; and at the  expiration of that period, was placed by my guardian in the house of the  celebrated Doctor Sanazio of Padua, as a student of medicine. Here, novel  and delightful studies, speculations, and scenes, opened upon my  inquisitive, ardent mind, and amused my enthusiastic imagination. Sanazio  was regarded in learned Padua, as little less than a demi-god; at certain  hours he visited his patients, amongst whom might generally be numbered  three-fourths of the population of Padua; at certain hours, his own  mansion was crowded like the audience-hall of some mighty potentate, with  supplicants for food and physic; three evenings in the week were devoted  by him to intense study in his own secret,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11541"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 20, No. 567, (#5)"],[1,"economist, as also  to bring the matter out in its fair proportions; but to establish the  matter clearly within the bounds of a safe, an easy, and practical issue,  we have merely to state, that a conversion of food from a physical to a  moral purpose, adequate to the supply of one-fourth part of the above  aggregate estimate, that is to say, to four millions, is amply sufficient  to relieve us at the present moment from that pressure of pauperism which  sits like an incubus upon the energies of the nation, and which will  precipitate us, if not timely avoided, into speedy and irretrievable ruin.    Now the suppression of the stage-horses upon our principal thoroughfares,  and of the dray-horses in the great commercial towns, may be calculated  to economize a saving of food equivalent to the supply of the above number  of human beings.    It is, perhaps, not superfluous to remark, that the amount of food,  equal to the supply of the said four millions, is not the produce of an  extended agriculture and proportionate outlay, but is just _that part_  of the annual produce of the country, subtracted from the whole, which  is at present required for the mere purpose of _transportation_--i.e. to  feed the animals used for draught,--and is consequently a dead loss as  unproductive capital.    In addition to the evil arising from such a consumption of unproductive  food, is also to be considered the very great loss consequent upon the  heavy capital sunk in _horse_ purchase. Were this viewed, as properly it  ought, as money withheld from other purposes of trade, and which might  be more advantageously invested, our capitalists and men of science  would not oppose the substitution of inanimate for animate power in the  way they have done. Neither, did the landed interest maturely weigh the  varied benefits it will produce in agriculture, would they view it in  the light of an invasion upon their respective interests. They do not  give a _quid_ without receiving a _quo_ every way as valuable. The  reduction of farm consumption--the bugbear of the project--will be  met and compensated by a steady and proportionate demand from other  quarters. Whilst in the United Kingdom, the 8,100,000 acres of land now  required to feed the horses, together with the capital sunk in their  purchase, will, when both applied to other and general purposes, amply  compensate for the exchange.    In order more readily to show one effect, let the horses be considered  only 1,000; a smaller number may not make the argument so difficult. Let  us reduce _this_ number, and the farmer may then turn his oat-ground  into wheat-ground; and instead of so much land being employed to furnish  food for a thousand horses, the same land, when turned into tillage fit  to sow wheat upon, will produce sufficient bread-corn to feed two  thousand poor families.    Again, if instead of 20,000 horses, we keep 30,000 fat oxen, butchers'  meat will be always cheap to the operative classes, whilst the quantity  of tallow will of course make candles cheap: and so many hides lower the  price of leather, and of shoes and all other articles made of leather.  Or the same quantity of land may then keep thirty thousand cows, the  milk of which will make both butter and cheese cheaper to the poor,  as well as the labouring manufacturer; all which articles are very  considerable, and of material moment in the prices of our manufacturers,  as they, in a great measure, work their trade to rise and fall in price,  according to the cheapness of their materials and the necessaries of  life. The same may be said in favour of more sheep and woollen cloths.    (_To be concluded in our next_.)           *       *       *       *       *      THE EXPECTED COMET.      The comet of Biela is approaching the earth's orbit with increasing  velocity, and towards the end of the following month it will partially  intersect the course which the earth traverses in its journey round the  sun. Happily, the comet will be in advance of the earth, so that unless  our globe augments its pace, or the anticipated visitant retards its  journey, there will be no risk of any dangerous proximity, much less of  a hostile collision. During this return, at least, it will always be  more than two hundred times the moon's distance from us; and were it,  at any future time, to approach very much nearer than the orbit of our  satellite, its influence would be too inconsiderable to affect any of  the elements of the earth's path.    This comet is about 40,000 miles in diameter, and of that class termed  nebulous, having no tail, and probably no solid nucleus. The point where  the comet's centre crosses the plane of the ecliptic is within and very  near the curve which the earth describes,--so very near, that the  outskirts of the nebulous matter of the comet might possibly, at some  future visit, envelope our planet, and would thus enclose the earth, it  is not unlikely, at its ensuing return, if it were about a month later  than the time calculated, of its intersecting the plane of the earth's  motion.    The presence of the moon during the past week has interfered with  telescopic observations, or probably the comet might have been detected  as a small round nebulosity, moving midway between the northern horn of  Taurus and the bright star Capelle, towards Gemini. There are nebulae  near its course for which it must not be mistaken.    J.T.

We  expected better tact in its author, Mr. Inglis, than the adoption of the  title of one of the most successful and least imitable fictions of  modern times. The very title-page provokes a comparison between the Gil  Blas of Le Sage, and a string of romantic adventures, by Mr. Inglis; we  need not add, much to the disadvantage of the latter. It reminds us of  an attempt to cover the sun with a wet blanket. At the same time, the  merit of Mr. Inglis's Gil Blas must not be lowly rated. It abounds with  lively incident, pleasant bits and scenes of travel, and world-knowledge  very agreeably communicated, while its episodal narratives are of the  most wonder-fraught character. It has all the glitter and gaiety of  Spanish life and manners. The author discourses eloquently of \"the  charming Andaluz,\" and other _intriguantes_--absolute Dons of fathers  and monsters of husbands--mingling \"bloody-minded assassins,\" and  hideous wretches, with the sweet emotions of dark eyes, jetty ringlets,  and heaving bosoms. Limbs are lopped off, eyes put out, heads slivered,  and blood spilled like water; and there are scenes in dark towers and  visions of clanking chains in terrific abundance. One of the latter  description we have abridged and adapted to our pages. The hero is  convicted of murder, upon such evidence as this:--\"We found the poor  dead man dead at his feet, and the sword in his hand, covered with  blood,--the murdered man lies in the ante-room run through and through.\"  A pretty scene of justice ensues, the fact being that the murdered man  was a noted robber who had attacked the hero, and became worsted in the  affray. The sentence is solitary imprisonment for life:]    The unfortunate persons whose crimes have subjected them to the dreadful  punishment of solitary imprisonment for life, in any of the southern  parts of Spain, are most generally sent to Tarifa.[3] Along both sides  of the port, there is a mole nearly half a mile in length; at the  extremity of which on either side, and at the entrance of the harbour,  stands a huge and ancient Moorish tower, about a hundred and sixty feet  in height above the sea. In this tower, which contains six chambers,  one above another, prisoners for life are confined; and thither I was  accordingly conveyed. It is the policy of the Spanish laws, to render  the punishment of criminals subservient to public utility; and this is  in some degree effected even by solitary confinement. The prisoners  confined in these towers are employed in turns, night by night, in  trimming the lamps--which are a beacon to the vessels at sea. From each  chamber, there is a separate ascent to the summit of the tower; so that  the prisoners never see each other, and each in his turn is obliged to  remain from night until day-break upon the summit,--part of his  punishment for the destruction of human life, being thus made  subservient to its preservation.          [3] A town in the straits of Gibraltar, the most southern point of          the continent of Europe.      From these towers there are no visible means of escape: in the chambers,  the windows are merely circular holes in walls at least six feet in  thickness; and the outside walls being entirely smooth, there are no means  of descent from the summit unless by a fearful leap of a hundred and sixty  feet into the sea; for on the side towards the town, a wall of twenty  feet high shuts out the prospect of land; serving at the same time as a  hindrance to any communication, and as an aggravation of punishment, by  shutting out from the eye of the prisoner, the cheerful lights of human  habitations, or perhaps even, it might be, the dim view of human forms. It  only requires to be added to this description, that a ponderous iron chain  stretches from one tower to the other, across the mouth of the port,  depending from fastenings situated about two feet below the summit of each,  but forming a curve by its own weight; and in the centre, reaching to  within twenty or thirty feet of the surface of the water, from which point,  other chains are attached, reaching horizontally to the towers on either  side. It is needless to say, that during the day this great chain is  lowered into the water when vessels desire to enter; but at night, it is  again raised;"]]]
