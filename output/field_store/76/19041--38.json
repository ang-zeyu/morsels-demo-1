Volume 4: Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and (#4)"],[1,"prevent the difficulty in eating that would be  experienced if the plate were a trifle small. It should therefore be  remembered that the salad plate is the next larger in size to the  bread-and-butter plate.    32. In case individual salads are to be prepared, the plate should  first be garnished with whatever vegetable green is selected for this  purpose. If lettuce is to be used, a single leaf, several very small  center leaves, or a small quantity of shredded lettuce will be  sufficient, for a great deal of garnish is never desirable. In case the  leaves are very large, one may be divided in half and each part  utilized. Then the salad ingredients, which have already been combined,  should be piled in a neat heap on top of the garnish either with or  without the salad dressing. If the salad dressing is not mixed with the  materials, a spoonful or two of it should be placed on top of them.  Sometimes, for the effect of color, additional garnish of some kind is  used. For a vegetable or a meat salad, this may be egg yolk put through  a sieve, slices of hard-cooked eggs, olives or radishes cut in fancy  shapes, or strips of pimiento; and for fruit salad, it may be cherries  or colored fruits cut into various fancy shapes.    33. Another method of serving this dish is to place the entire salad on  a rather large, deep plate, such as a chop plate or a regular salad  dish, and then serve it at the table whenever it is desired. When this  is done, the dish that is used should be well garnished with a bed of  vegetable green in the same way that a small individual plate is  garnished. Then the salad ingredients should be nicely arranged on this  bed, and the dressing, if it has not already been mixed with them,  should be poured over the whole. In serving salad in this way, there is  much more chance of arranging the ingredients symmetrically and  garnishing the salad attractively than when it is served on small  plates. The large plate containing the salad, together with the small  salad plates, should be placed before the hostess or whoever is to serve  the salad. When it is served, a leaf of the lettuce or other green used  for garnishing should first be put on each salad plate and the salad  should be served on this. A large fork and a large spoon are needed when  salad is served in this manner.    34. Still another, way of serving salad, and perhaps a more attractive  one than either of those already described, consists in arranging the  ingredients in a salad bowl, placing this on the table, and serving from  the bowl to the salad plates. In this method, a French dressing is  generally used, and this is often mixed at the table and added to the  salad just before it is put on the small plates. Such a salad can be  made very attractive, and it should be remembered above all things that  the appearance of a salad is its great asset until it is eaten and that  an artistically made salad always helps to make the meal more  satisfactory.    35. In a dinner, the salad is generally served as a separate course, but  in such a meal as luncheon it may be used as the main dish. If it is  used as a separate course, it should be served immediately after the  dinner course has been removed from the table. The salad plate should be  placed directly before the person served. Forks especially designed with  a wide prong on one side and known as _salad forks_ are the right type  of fork to serve with this dish, but if none are available ordinary  table forks of a small size may be used. It should be remembered that  the salad should not be cut with the knife at the table, but should be  eaten entirely with the fork.      SALAD DRESSINGS AND THEIR PREPARATION    36. As has been implied, various salad dressings may be made to serve  with salads. The kind of dressing to select depends both on the variety  of salad served and on the personal preference of those to whom it is  served. Some of these contain only a few ingredients and are  comparatively simple to make, while others are complex and involve  considerable work in their making. Whether simple or elaborate, however,  the salad dressing should be carefully chosen, so that it will blend  well with the ingredients of the salad with which it is used.    A number of recipes for salad dressings are here given. They are taken  up before the recipes for salads so that the beginner will be familiar  with the different varieties when they are mentioned in connection with  the salads. As many of the recipes as possible should be tried, not only  for the knowledge that will be gained, but also for the practical  experience.    37. FRENCH DRESSING.--A dressing that is very simply made and that can  probably be used with a greater variety of salads than any other is  French dressing. For instance, it may be used with any vegetable salad,  with salads containing almost any combination of fruit, and with meat,  fish, and egg salads. It is true, of course, that fruit-salad dressing  blends very well with fruit salad and is considered by most persons to  be more delicious than French dressing, but if one is pressed for time  and does not have the necessary ingredients for making any other kind,  this one may nearly always be utilized. In addition to these uses,  French dressing, as has been previously explained, may also be used to  marinate salads before mayonnaise or other dressing is mixed with them.  A point that should always be remembered in the making of this dressing  or any other dressing containing oil is that the flavor of the oil has  much to do with the desirability of the finished dressing.    FRENCH DRESSING    3/4 tsp. salt  1/4 tsp. mustard  1/4 tsp. pepper  3 Tb. vinegar  1/4 tsp. paprika  1/2 c. oil    Measure the dry ingredients and place them in a bowl. Measure the  vinegar and oil and add them to the dry ingredients. If possible, place  a piece of ice the size of a walnut in the bowl. Beat with a fork until  the ingredients are thoroughly mixed and the oil and vinegar form an  emulsion that will remain for a short time. The ingredients will  separate if the dressing is allowed to stand, but the colder they are,  the more easily will the emulsion form and the longer will it remain. If  ice cannot be used, have the ingredients as cold as possible before  mixing them.    38. Sometimes a more highly seasoned French dressing is desired. In such  an event, there should be beaten into the dressing just described the  following ingredients:    2 Tb. finely chopped onion or 1 Tb. onion juice  2 Tb. chopped pimiento  1 large green pepper, chopped  2 Tb. chopped parsley    39. MAYONNAISE DRESSING.--Although mayonnaise dressing is prepared  without the application of heat, it is not one of the simplest dressings  to prepare. It meets with much favor, being used almost as extensively  as French dressing, but it is perhaps less desirable with fruit salads  than with others. It is also much used as a basis for numerous other  dressings. Since it requires considerable time for its preparation, a  wise plan is to make more than enough for one meal. However, it should  not be made in large quantities, for the oil separates from the  remainder of the ingredients if it is allowed to stand too long. If it  is thoroughly beaten and kept extremely cold, it may perhaps keep for a  week, but keeping it longer than that is not advisable. Before serving,  it may be thinned by beating either sweet or sour cream into it. It may  be made fluffy and light and its quantity may be increased by beating  whipped cream into it.    MAYONNAISE DRESSING    1/2 tsp. salt  2 egg yolks  1/4 tsp. pepper  1-1/2 c. oil  1/4 tsp. mustard  4 Tb. vinegar or lemon juice    Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl. Separate the eggs and add the yolks  to the dry ingredients. Beat these with a rotary egg beater until they  are well mixed. To this mixture, add a few drops of oil and continue to  beat. Add a drop of the vinegar or lemon juice, a few more drops of oil,  and beat constantly. Gradually increase the quantity of oil added each  time, but do not do this rapidly. As the oil is added and the beating is  continued, it will be noted that the mixture grows thicker, but when  vinegar is added the mixture is thinned. The quantity of vinegar is so  much less than that of oil that the oil may be added in small amounts  two or three times in succession before vinegar is added.    This process is rather long and slow, but if the mixing is done  correctly, the result will be a thick, smooth mixture that will not  separate for possibly 6 or 7 days. Mayonnaise mixers, which may be  procured for making this dressing, make the work easier, but they are  not at all necessary. Mayonnaise may be made as successfully with a bowl  and a rotary beater, if it will just be remembered that the liquid  ingredients must be added slowly and that they must be as cold  as possible.    40. COOKED MAYONNAISE.--A dressing that is very similar both in texture  and taste to the mayonnaise just explained and perhaps a little easier  to make is known as cooked mayonnaise. This dressing, as will be noted  from the accompanying recipe, may be made in larger quantities than the  uncooked mayonnaise.    COOKED MAYONNAISE    2 Tb. oil  1/4 tsp. mustard  4 Tb. flour  1/4 tsp. paprika  1/2  c. vinegar  2 eggs  1 c. boiling water  2 c. oil  1 Tb. salt    Mix the 2 tablespoonfuls of oil and the flour and pour in the vinegar.  Add the boiling water and stir the mixture until it is perfectly smooth  and well mixed. Place over the fire and cook for about 5 minutes.  Remove from the fire and cool. When completely cooled, add the salt,  mustard, and paprika. Separate the eggs and beat the yolks and whites  separately. Add the egg yolks to the mixture. Add the 2 cupfuls of oil a  little at a time, beating thoroughly with a rotary beater each time oil  is added. When all of this is completely mixed and thoroughly beaten,  fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9939"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 5: Fruit and Fruit Desserts; (#4)"],[1,"sweet. This change accounts  for the fact that some cooked fruits are less sweet than others, in  spite of the fact that the acid does not seem to be increased.    26. In addition to producing certain changes in fruit, cooking, if done  thoroughly, renders fruits sterile, as it does other foods; that is, it  kills any bacteria that the fruits may contain. Advantage of this fact  is taken when fruits are canned for future use. Although most persons  prefer raw fruit to that which is cooked, there are some who object to  eating this food raw, but who are not always certain as to the reason  for their objection. Like other raw foods, fruits in their fresh state  contain _vitamines_; that is, a substance that helps to keep the body in  a healthy, normal condition. These are found to some extent in cooked  fruits, but not in the same quantity as in raw ones; consequently, as  much use as possible should be made of raw fruits in the diet.           *       *       *       *       *    FRUITS AND THEIR PREPARATION AS FOOD    PREPARING AND SERVING    27. REQUIRED SANITARY CONDITIONS.--Since large quantities of fruits are  eaten raw, it is necessary that they be handled in the most sanitary  manner if disease from their use be prevented. However, they are often  in an unsanitary condition when they reach the housewife. For instance,  they become contaminated from the soiled hands of the persons who handle  them, from the dirt deposited on them during their growth, from the  fertilizer that may be used on the soil, from flies and other insects  that may crawl over them, and from being stored, displayed, or sold in  surroundings where they may be exposed to the dirt from streets and  other contaminating sources. Because of the possibility of all these  sources of contamination, it is essential that fruits that are not to be  cooked be thoroughly washed before they are eaten. It is true that a  certain amount of flavor or food material may be lost from the washing,  but this is of little importance compared with the possibility of  preventing disease.    28. WASHING FRUITS.--The manner of washing fruits depends largely on the  nature of the fruit. Fruits that have a sticky surface, such as raisins,  figs, and dates, usually have to be washed in several waters. Hard  fruits, such as pears, apples, plums, etc., should be washed with  running water. Berries and softer fruits require more careful procedure,  it usually being advisable to pour them into a pan containing water and  then, after stirring them around in the water until all dirt is removed,  take them from the water, rather than pour the water from them. In any  event, all fruits eaten raw should be properly washed.    29. SERVING FRUITS.--While the serving of fruits is a simple matter, it  should be done in as dainty a way as possible, so as not to detract from  their natural attractiveness. If the skins are to remain on the fruits  while serving, a knife, preferably a fruit knife, should be served with  them, and nothing smaller than a salad plate should be used. The  carefully washed leaves of the fruit served make an attractive garnish.  For instance, large, perfect strawberries with the stems on, when heaped  on a plate garnished with strawberry leaves and served with a small dish  of powdered sugar, are always attractive. Likewise, a bunch of grapes  served on grape leaves never fails to attract.    A mixture of a number of fruits, such as peaches, pears, and plums, or,  in winter, oranges, bananas, and apples, piled in a large bowl and  passed after salad plates have been distributed, not only makes an  excellent dessert, but permits the persons served to take their choice.    Fresh berries, sliced peaches, bananas, oranges, etc. may be served in  sauce dishes, which should be placed on a service plate. They may be  passed or served from a bowl by the hostess. Canned or stewed fruits may  be served in the same way.           *       *       *       *       *    BERRIES    NATURE AND CARE    30. BERRIES are among the most perishable fruits and begin to come into  market early in the summer season. In most localities, the berry season  begins with strawberries and ends with blackberries. Because the  numerous varieties are somewhat juicy and soft and therefore extremely  perishable, they will not stand shipping and storage for long periods of  time. The quality of berries depends much on the nature of the season,  as well as on the locality in which the berries are grown. If there is a  good supply of rain, the berries will be very moist, containing a large  amount of pulp in proportion to seeds and skins; but if the season is  very dry, the berries are likely to be less moist and consequently less  palatable. A general use of berries, and to almost every one the most  important, is the making of jams, jellies, and preserves.    In the preparation of berries for the table, they should be handled as  little as possible in order to prevent them from breaking up and losing  their shape. After being purchased, they should be kept where it is cool  until they are to be used. It is advisable not to wash them until just  before serving, as the extra handling usually bruises them and causes  them to spoil.    The different varieties of berries are here taken up in alphabetical  order so as to make the matter easy for reference. Those of which  extensive use is made contain one or more recipes that may be followed  without any hesitation. In a few instances, as in the case of currants,  recipes are not included, as the fruits are limited to only a few uses  and directions for these occur elsewhere.      BLACKBERRIES    31. BLACKBERRIES come late in the summer season. Good varieties of  cultivated blackberries, which are large in size and contain  comparatively few seeds, are the best for use. However, in some  localities, uncultivated blackberries grow in sufficient quantities to  be useful for food. Blackberries are used extensively for jam, as they  make an excellent kind that appeals to most persons. Their juice may be  used for jelly, but if the berries are to be utilized most successfully  in this way they must be picked before they are thoroughly ripe or some  fruit that will supply an additional quantity of pectin may have to be  combined with them. Fresh blackberries may be served for dessert with  sugar and cream. Otherwise, the use of this fruit in desserts is not  very extensive, except where the canned berries are used for pastry or  pie or are eaten for sauce or where the jam is used in making up various  dessert dishes.    Very little preparation is necessary in getting blackberries ready to  serve. They should simply be looked over carefully, so that all  imperfect ones and all foreign matter may be removed, and then washed in  cold water.    32. BLACKBERRY SPONGE.--One of the few desserts made from fresh  blackberries is that explained in the accompanying recipe and known as  blackberry sponge. This is very delicious, for the berries are combined  with cake and the combination then served with whipped cream.    BLACKBERRY SPONGE  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 qt. blackberries  3/4 c. sugar  1 c. water  4 pieces plain loaf or sponge cake  Whipped cream    Heat half of the berries with the sugar and the water until they are  mushy. Then force the whole through a sieve. Cut the cake into cubes and  put them into a bowl. Pour the juice and the blackberry pulp on the  cake. Press the mixture down with a spoon until it is quite solid and  set in the refrigerator or some other cold place to cool. Turn out of  the bowl on a large plate, garnish with the remaining berries, heap with  the whipped cream, and serve.      BLUEBERRIES    33. BLUEBERRIES, which are not cultivated, but grow in the wild state,  are a many-seeded berry, blue or bluish-black in color. _Huckleberries_,  although belonging to a different class, are commonly regarded as  blueberries by many persons. Berries of this kind occur in many  varieties. Some grow on low bushes close to the ground, others are found  on taller bushes, and still others grow on very tall bushes. Again, some  grow in dry ground in a mountainous region, others grow in a level,  sandy soil, and other varieties succeed better on swampy soil. Berries  of this class are not so perishable as most other berries, but in many  localities they cannot be purchased at all, for, as a rule, they are  used only in the immediate vicinity in which they grow.    Blueberries have small seeds and coarse, tough skins. They contain very  little acid, but are excellent for pies and sauce. However, they will  make jelly very well if there are a few partly ripe berries among them,  and their flavor is improved if some fruit containing acid is added to  them. To prepare them for use, whether they are to be served raw or  cooked, look them over carefully in order that all green or spoiled ones  are removed and then wash them well in cold water.    34. PRESSED BLUEBERRY PUDDING.--A delicious pudding can be made by  combining blueberries with slices of bread. The accompanying recipe  gives directions for pudding of this kind.    PRESSED BLUEBERRY PUDDING  (Sufficient to Serve Eight)    1 qt. blueberries  1 c. water  1/2 c. sugar  8 slices bread  Whipped cream    Put the blueberries, water, and sugar into a saucepan and boil for a  few minutes. Put four of the slices of bread, which should be cut about  1/2 inch thick, in the bottom of a square pan. Pour one-half of the  blueberries and the juice over the bread, and put the four remaining  slices of bread on top of the berries. Pour the rest of the blueberries  and juice over the bread. Place another square pan over the top and  weight it down so as to press the pudding. Then set the pudding in the  refrigerator until it is cool. Cut into squares, remove from the pan,  and serve with sweetened whipped cream.    35. BLUEBERRY PUDDING.--A baking-powder-biscuit dough baked with  blueberries makes a"]]]
