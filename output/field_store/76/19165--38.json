Ay, the wise men would smile and shake their heads when he presented  this case to their consideration, but he would make his account so  accurate and particular and so well witnessed that they would have to  admit the truth of all he said. And science, which proclaimed that  matter was indestructible and that the mind was matter and that the  brain needed nourishment like any other muscle--science would have to  hang the head and wonder!    The eyes of the girl brought him to halt in his pacing, and he stopped,  confronting her. His excitement had transformed him. His nostrils were  quivering, his eyes were pointed with light, his head was high, and he  breathed fast. He was flushed as the Roman Conqueror. And his excitement  tinged the girl, also, with colour.    She offered to take him to his room as soon as he wished to go. He was  quite willing. He wanted to be alone, to think. But when he followed her  she stopped him in the hall. Buck Daniels lumbered slowly after them in  a clumsy attempt at sauntering.    \"Well?\" asked Kate Cumberland.    She had thrown a blue mantle over her shoulders when she entered the  house, and the touch of boyish self-confidence which had been hers on  the ride was gone. In its place there was something even more difficult  for Randall Byrne to face. If there had been a garish brightness about  her when he had first seen her, the brilliancy of a mirror playing in  the sun against his feeble eyes, there was now a blending of pastel  shades, for the hall was dimly illumined and the shadow tarnished her  hair and her pallor was like cold stone; even her eyes were misted by  fear. Yet a vital sense of her nearness swept upon Byrne, and he felt as  if he were surrounded--by a danger.    \"Opinions,\" said the doctor, \"based on so summary an examination are  necessarily inexact, yet the value of a first impression is not  negligible. The best I can say is that there is probably no immediate  danger, but Mr. Cumberland is seriously ill. Furthermore, it is _not_  old age.\"    He would not say all he thought; it was not yet time.    She winced and clasped her hands tightly together. She was like a child  about to be punished for a crime it has not committed, and it came  vaguely to the doctor that he might have broached his ill tidings more  gently.    He added: \"I must have further opportunities for observance before I  give a detailed opinion and suggest a treatment.\"    Her glance wandered past him and at once the heavy step of Buck Daniels  approached.    \"At least,\" she murmured, \"I am glad that you are frank. I don't want to  have anything kept from me, please. Buck, will you take the doctor up to  his room?\" She managed a faint smile. \"This is an old-fashioned house,  Doctor Byrne, but I hope we can make you fairly comfortable. You'll ask  for whatever you need?\"    The doctor bowed, and was told that they would dine in half an hour,  then the girl went back towards the room in which Joe Cumberland lay.  She walked slowly, with her head bent, and her posture seemed to Byrne  the very picture of a burden-bearer. Then he followed Daniels up the  stairs, led by the jingling of the spurs, great-rowelled spurs that  might grip the side of a refractory horse like teeth.    A hall-light guided them, and from the hall Buck Daniels entered a room  and fumbled above him until he had lighted a lamp which was suspended by  two chains from the ceiling, a circular burner which cast a glow as keen  as an electric globe. It brought out every detail of the old-fashioned  room--the bare, painted floor; the bed, in itself a separate and  important piece of architecture with its four tall posts, a relic of the  times when beds were built, not simply made; and there was a chest of  drawers with swelling, hospitable front, and a rectangular mirror above  with its date in gilt paint on the upper edge. A rising wind shook the  window and through some crack stirred the lace curtains; it was a very  comfortable retreat, and the doctor became aware of aching muscles and a  heavy brain when he glanced at the bed.    The same gust of wind which rattled the window-pane now pushed, as with  invisible and ghostly hand, a door which opened on the side of the  bedroom, and as it swung mysteriously and gradually wide the doctor  found himself looking into an adjoining chamber. All he could see  clearly was a corner on which struck the shaft of light from the lamp,  and lying on the floor in that corner was something limp and brown. A  snake, he surmised at first, but then he saw clearly that it was a chain  of formidable proportions bolted against the wall at one end and  terminating at the other in a huge steel collar. A chill started in the  boots of the doctor and wriggled its uncomfortable way up to his head.    \"Hell!\" burst out Buck Daniels. \"How'd _that_ door get open?\" He slammed  it with violence. \"She's been in there again, I guess,\" muttered the  cowpuncher, as he stepped back, scowling.    \"Who?\" ventured the doctor.    Buck Daniels whirled on him.    \"None of your--\" he began hotly, but checked himself with choking  suddenness and strode heavily from the room.          CHAPTER V    THE WAITING      The doctor removed his coat with absent-minded slowness, and all the  time that he was removing the dust and the stains of travel, he kept  narrowing the eye of his mind to visualise more clearly that cumbersome  chain which lay on the floor of the adjoining room. Now, the doctor was  not of a curious or gossipy nature, but if someone had offered to tell  him the story of that chain for a thousand dollars, the doctor at that  moment would have thought the price ridiculously small.    Then the doctor went down to the dinner table prepared to keep one eye  upon Buck Daniels and the other upon Kate Cumberland. But if he expected  to learn through conversation at the table he was grievously  disappointed, for Buck Daniels ate with an eye to strict business that  allowed no chatter, and the girl sat with a forced smile and an absent  eye. Now and again Buck would glance up at her, watch her for an  instant, and then turn his attention back to his plate with a sort of  gloomy resolution; there were not half a dozen words exchanged from the  beginning to the end of the meal.    After that they went in to the invalid. He lay in the same position,  his skinny hands crossed upon his breast, and his shaggy brows were  drawn so low that the eyes were buried in profound shadow. They took  positions in a loose semi-circle, all pointing towards the sick man, and  it reminded Byrne with grim force of a picture he had seen of three  wolves waiting for the bull moose to sink in the snows: they, also, were  waiting for a death. It seemed, indeed, as if death must have already  come; at least it could not make him more moveless than he was. Against  the dark wall his profile was etched by a sharp highlight which was  brightest of all on his forehead and his nose; while the lower portion  of the face was lost in comparative shadow.    So perfect and so detailed was the resemblance to death, indeed, that  the lips in the shadow smiled--fixedly. It was not until Kate Cumberland  shifted a lamp, throwing more light on her father, that Byrne saw that  the smile was in reality a forcible compression of the lips. He  understood, suddenly, that the silent man on the couch was struggling  terribly against an hysteria of emotion. It brought beads of sweat out  upon the doctor's tall forehead; for this perfect repose suggested an  agony more awful than yells and groans and struggles. The silence was  like acid; it burned without a flame. And Byrne knew, that moment, the  quality of the thing which had wasted the rancher. It was this acid of  grief or yearning which had eaten deep into him and was now close to his  heart. The girl had said that for six months he had been failing. Six  months! Six eternities of burning at the stake!    He lay silent, waiting; and his resignation meant that he knew death  would come before that for which he waited. Silence, that was the  key-note of the room. The girl was silent, her eyes dark with grief; yet  they were not fixed upon her father. It came thrilling home to Byrne  that her sorrow was not entirely for her dying parent, for she looked  beyond him rather than at him. Was she, too, waiting? Was that what gave  her the touch of sad gravity, the mystery like the mystery of distance?    And Buck Daniels. He, also, said nothing. He rolled cigarettes one after  another with amazing dexterity and smoked them with half a dozen Titanic  breaths. His was a single-track mind. He loved the girl, and he bore the  sign of his love on his face. He wanted her desperately; it was a hunger  like that of Tantalus, too keen to be ever satisfied. Yet, still more  than he looked at the girl, he, also, stared into the distance. He,  also, was waiting!    It was the deep suspense of Cumberland which made him so silently alert.  He was as intensely alive as the receiver of a wireless apparatus; he  gathered information from the empty air.    So that Byrne was hardly surprised, when, in the midst of that grim  silence, the old man raised a rigid forefinger of warning. Kate and  Daniels stiffened in their chairs and Byrne felt his flesh creep. Of  course it was nothing. The wind, which had shaken the house with several  strong gusts before dinner, had now grown stronger and blew with  steadily increasing violence; perhaps the sad old man had been attracted  by the mournful chorus and imagined some sound he knew within it.    But now once more the finger was raised, the arm extended, shaking  violently, and Joe Cumberland turned upon "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12443"],[0,"The Jute Industry: From Seed to Finished Cloth (#5)"],[1,"sheet by  the operatives. The upper rollers in the machine may rise in their  bearings against the downward pressure of the volute springs on the  bearings; this provision is essential because of the thick and thin  places of the heads.    A different type of bale opener, made by Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons, &  Co., Dundee, and designed from the Butchart patent is illustrated in  Fig. 9. It differs mainly from the machine illustrated in Fig. 8 in  the shape of the crushing or opening rollers.    It will be seen on referring to the illustration that there are  three crushing rollers, one large central roller on the top and  situated between two lower but smaller rollers. Each roller has a  series of knobs projecting from a number of parallel rings. The  knobs are so arranged that they force themselves into the hard  layers of jute, and, in addition to this action, the heads of jute  have to bend partially round the larger roller as they are passing  between the rollers. This double action naturally aids in opening up  the material, and the machine, which is both novel and effective,  gives excellent results in practice. The degree of pressure provided  for the top roller may be varied to suit different conditions of heads  of jute by the number of weights which are shown clearly in the  highest part of the machine in the form of two sets of heavy discs.    [Illustration: FIG. 9 BALE OPENER _By permission of Messrs. Charles  Parker, Sons, & Co_.]    The driving side, the feed cloth, and the delivery cloth in this  machine are placed similarly to the corresponding parts of the  machine illustrated in Fig. 8, a machine which also gives good  results in practice.    In both cases the large heads are delivered in such a condition that  the operatives can split them up into pieces of a suitable size  quite freely.    The men who bring in the bales from the store take up a position  near the end of the delivery cloth; they remove the heads of jute as  the latter approach the end of the table, and then pass them to the  batchers, who split them. The most suitable size of pieces are 2-1/2  to 3 lbs. for a piece of 7 feet to 8 feet in length, but the size of  the pieces is regulated somewhat by the system of feeding which is  to be adopted at the breaker-card, as well as by the manager's  opinion of what will give the best overall result.    After the heads of jute have been split up into suitable smaller  pieces, they are placed in any convenient position for the batcher  or \"striker-up\" to deal with. If the reader could watch the above  operation of separating the heads of jute into suitable sizes, it  would perhaps be much easier to understand the process of  unravelling an apparently matted and crossed mass of fibre. As the  loosened head emerges from the bale-opener, Figs. 8 or 9, it is  placed over the operative's arm with the ends of the head hanging,  and by a sort of intuition acquired by great experience, she or he  grips the correct amount of fibre between the fingers, and by a  dexterous movement, and a simultaneous shake of the whole piece, the  handful just comes clear of the bulk and in much less time than it  takes to describe the operation.    As the pieces are thus detached from the bulk, they are laid on  stools or tables, or in stalls or carts, according to the method by  means of which the necessary amount of oil and water is to be added  for the essential process of lubrication; this lubrication enables  the fibre to work freely in the various machines.          CHAPTER VI.  BATCHING    _Softening and Softening Machines_. Two distinct courses are  followed in the preparation of the jute fibre after it leaves the  bale opener, and before it is carded by the breaker card. These  courses are designated as--          1. Hand Batching.        2. Machine Batching.    In the former process, which is not largely practised, the pieces of  jute are neatly doubled, while imparting a slight twist, to  facilitate subsequent handling, and laid in layers in large carts  which can be wheeled from place to place; if this method is not  convenient, the pieces are doubled similarly and deposited in large  stalls such as those illustrated in Fig. 10.    On the completion of each layer, or sometimes two layers, the  necessary measured amount of oil is evenly sprayed by hand over the  pieces from cans provided with suitable perforated outlets--usually  long tubes. After the oil has been added, water, from a similar  sprayer attached by tubing to a water tap, is added until the  attendant has applied what he or she considers is the proper quantity.  The ratio between a measured amount of oil and an unmeasured amount  of water is thus somewhat varied, and for this reason the above  method is not to be commended. A conscientious worker can, however,  with judgment, introduce satisfactory proportions which are, of  course, supplied by the person in charge. In Fig. 10, the tank on  the right is where the oil is stored, while the oil can, and the  spray-pipe and tube for water, are shown near the second post or  partition on the right.    [ILLUSTRATION: FIG. 10 HAND-BATCHING DEPARTMENT WITH UNPREPARED AND  PREPARED FIBRE]    The first stall--that next to the oil tank--in Fig. 10 is filled  with the prepared pieces, and the contents are allowed to remain  there for some time, say 24 hours, in order that the material may be  more or less uniformly lubricated or conditioned. At the end of this  time, the pieces are ready to be conveyed to and fed into the  softening machines where the fibres undergo a further process of  bending and crushing.    All softening machines for jute, or softeners as they are often  called, are similar in construction, but the number of pairs of  rollers varies according to circumstances and to the opinions of  managers. Thus, the softener illustrated in Fig. 11, which, in the  form shown, is intended to treat jute from the above-mentioned stalls,  is made with 47, 55, 63 or 71 pairs of rollers or any other number  which, minus 1, is a measure of 8. The sections are made in 8's. The  illustration shows only 31 pairs.    The first pair of rollers--that next to the feed sheet in the  foreground of Fig. 11--is provided with straight flutes as clearly  shown. All the other rollers, however, are provided with oblique  flutes, such flutes making a small angle with the horizontal. What  is often considered as a standard softening machine contains 63  pairs of fluted rollers besides the usual feed and delivery rollers.  As mentioned above, this number is varied according to circumstances.    The lubricated pieces of jute are fed on to the feed roller sheet,  and hence undergo a considerable amount of bending in different ways  before they emerge from the delivery rollers at the other end of the  machine.    [Illustration: Fig. 11 Softening machine without batching apparatus]    Machine batching is preferred by many firms because the application  of oil and water, and the proportion of each, are much more uniform  than they are by the above mentioned process of hand batching. On the  other hand, there is no time for conditioning the fibre because the  lubrication and the softening are proceeding simultaneously,  although conditioning may proceed while the fibre remains in the  cart after it has left the softener.    The mechanical apparatus as made by Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co.,  Ltd., Dundee, for depositing the oil and water on the pieces or  \"stricks\" of jute is illustrated in Fig. 12. The actual lubricating  equipment is situated on the top of the rectangular frame in the  centre of the illustration. This frame is bolted to the side frames  of the softening machine proper, say that shown in Fig. 11. Its  exact position, with respect to its distance from the feed, is a  matter of choice, but the liquid is often arranged to fall on to the  material at any point between the second and twelfth rollers.    In Fig. 12 the ends of 13 rollers of the upper set are seen clearly,  and these upper rollers are kept hard in contact with the stricks or  pieces of jute by means of the powerful springs shown immediately  above the roller bearings and partially enclosed in bell-jars.    Outside the rectangular frame in Fig. 12 are two rods, one vertical  and the other inclined. The straight or vertical rod is attached by  suitable levers and rods to the set-on handles at each end of the  machine and to the valve of the water pipe near the top of the frame,  while the upper end of the inclined or oblique rod is fulcrumed on a  rod projecting from the frame. The lower or curved end of the  oblique rod rests against the boss of one of the upper rollers.    [Illustration: Fig. 12]    The water valve is opened and closed with the starting and stopping  of the machine, but the oblique rod is moved only when irregular  feeding takes place. Thus, the upper rollers rise slightly against  the pressure of the springs when thick stricks appear; hence, when a  thick place passes under the roller which is in contact with the  curved end of the oblique rod, the end moves slightly clockwise, and  thus rotates the fulcrum rod; this results in an increased quantity  of oil being liberated from the source of supply, and the mechanism  is so arranged that the oil reaches the thick part of the strick.  When the above-mentioned upper roller descends, due to a decrease in  the thickness of the strick, the oblique rod and its fulcrum is  moved slightly counter-clockwise, and less oil is liberated for the  thin part of the strick. It will be understood that all makers of  softening machines supply the automatic lubricating or batching  apparatus when desired.    A view of a softener at work appears in Fig. 13. The bevel wheels at  the end of the rollers are naturally covered as a protection against  accidents. In many machines safety appliances are fitted at the feed  end so that the machine may be automatically stopped if the  operative is"]]]
