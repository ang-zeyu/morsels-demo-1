Milton read with selection, and \"meditated,\" says Aubrey,  what he read. His practice conformed to the principle he has himself  laid down in the often-quoted lines (_Paradise Regained_, iv. 322)--                                  Who reads      Incessantly, and to his reading brings not      A spirit and judgment equal or superior,      Uncertain and unsettled still remains,      Deep vers'd in books, and shallow in himself.    Some of Milton's Greek books have been traced; his _Arattis,  Lyeophron, Euripides_ (the Stepharnis of 1602), and his _Pindar_ (the  Benedictus of 1620), are still extant, with marginal memoranda, which  should seem to evince careful and discerning reading. One critic  even thought it worth while to accuse Joshua Barnes of silently  appropriating conjectural emendations from Milton's _Euripides_. But  Milton's own poems are the beat evidence of his familiarity with all  that is most choice in the remains of classic poetry. Though the  commentators are accused of often, seeing an imitation where there  is none, no commentary can point out the ever-present infusion of  classical flavour, which bespeaks intimate converse far more than  direct adaptation. Milton's classical allusions, says Hartley  Coleridge, are amalgamated and consubstantiated with his native  thought.    A commonplace book of Milton's, after having lurked unsuspected for  200 years in the archives of Netherby, has been disinterred in our  own day (1874). It appears to belong partly to the end of the Horton  period. It is not by any means an account of all that he is reading,  but only an arrangement, under certain heads, or places of memoranda  for future use. These notes are extracted from about eighty different  authors, Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and English. Of Greek authors  no less than sixteen are quoted. The notes are mostly notes of  historical facts, seldom of thoughts, never of mere verbal expression.  There is no trace in it of any intention to store up either the  imagery or the language of poetry. It may be that such notes were  made and entered in another volume; for the book thus accidentally  preserved to us seems to refer to other similar volumes of  collections. But it is more likely that no such poetical memoranda  were ever made, and that Milton trusted entirely to memory for the  wealth of classical allusion with which his verse is surcharged. He  did not extract from the poets and the great writers whom he was  daily turning over, but only from the inferior authors and secondary  historians, which he read only once. Most of the material collected  in the commonplace book is used in his prose pamphlets. But when so  employed the facts are worked into the texture of his argument, rather  than cited as extraneous witnesses.    In reading history it was his aim to get at a conspectus of the  general current of affairs rather than to study minutely a special  period. He tells Diodati in September, 1637, that he has studied  Greek history continuously, from the beginning to the fall of  Constantinople. When he tells the same friend that he has been long  involved in the obscurity of the early middle ages of Italian History  down to the time of the Emperor Rudolph, we learn from the commonplace  book that he had only been reading the one volume of Sigonius's  _Historia Regni Italici_. From the thirteenth century downwards he  proposes to himself to study each Italian state in some separate  history. Even before his journey to Italy he read Italian with as much  ease as French. He tells us that it was by his father's advice that he  had acquired these modern languages. But we can, see that they were  essential parts of his own scheme of self-education, which included,  in another direction, Hebrew, both Biblical and Rabbinical and even  Syriac.    The intensity of his nature showed itself in his method of study. He  read, not desultorily, a bit here and another there, but \"when I take  up with a thing, I never pause or break it off, nor am drawn away from  it by any other interest, till I have arrived at the goal I proposed  to myself,\" He made breaks occasionally In this routine of study by  visits to London, to see friends, to buy books, to take lessons in  mathematics, to go to the theatre, or to concerts. A love of music was  inherited from his father.    I have called this period, 1632-39, one of preparation, and not of  production. But though the first volume of poems printed by Milton did  not appear till 1645, the most considerable part of its contents was  written during the period included in the present chapter.    The fame of the author of _Paradise Lost_ has overshadowed that of the  author of _L'Allegro, Il Penseroso,_ and _Lycidas_. Yet had _Paradise  Lost_ never been written, these three poems, with _Comus_, would have  sufficed to place their author in a class apart, and above all those  who had used the English language for poetical purposes before him. It  is incumbent on Milton's biographer to relate the circumstances of the  composition of _Comus_, as it is an incident in the life of the poet.    Milton's musical tastes had brought him the acquaintance of Henry  Lawes, at that time the most celebrated composer in England. When the  Earl of Bridgewater would give an entertainment at Ludlow Castle to  celebrate his entry upon his office as President of Wales and the  Marches, it was to Lawes that application was made to furnish the  music. Lawes, as naturally, applied to his young poetical acquaintance  Milton, to write the words. The entertainment was to be of that  sort which was fashionable at court, and was called a Mask. In that  brilliant period of court life which was inaugurated by Elisabeth and  put an end to by the Civil War, a Mask was a frequent and favourite  amusement. It was an exhibition in which pageantry and music  predominated, but in which dialogue was introduced as accompaniment or  explanation.    The dramatic Mask of the sixteenth century has been traced by the  antiquaries as far back as the time of Edward III. But in its  perfected shape it was a genuine offspring of the English renaissance,  a cross between the vernacular mummery, or mystery-play, and the Greek  drama. No great court festival was considered complete without such a  public show. Many of our great dramatic writers, Beaumont, Fletcher,  Ben Jonson, Middleton, Dekker, Shirley, Carew, were constrained by the  fashion of the time to apply their invention to gratify this taste for  decorative representation. No less an artist than Inigo Jones must  occasionally stoop to construct the machinery.    The taste for grotesque pageant in the open air must have gradually  died out before the general advance of refinement. The Mask by a  process of evolution would have become the Opera. But it often happens  that when a taste or fashion is at the point of death, it undergoes a  forced and temporary revival. So it was with the Mask. In 1633,  the Puritan hatred to the theatre had blazed out in Prynne's  _Histriomastix_, and as a natural consequence, the loyal and cavalier  portion of society threw itself into dramatic amusements of every  kind. It was an unreal revival of the Mask, stimulated by political  passion, in the wane of genuine taste for the fantastic and  semi-barbarous pageant, in which the former age had delighted. What  the imagination of the spectators was no longer equal to, was to  be supplied by costliness of dress and scenery. Those last  representations of the expiring Mask were the occasions of an  extravagant outlay. The Inns of Court and Whitehall vied with each  other in the splendour and solemnity with which they brought out,--the  Lawyers, Shirley's _Triumph of Peace_,--the Court, Carew's _Coelum  Britannicum_.    It was a strange caprice of fortune that made the future poet of the  Puritan epic the last composer of a cavalier mask. The slight plot, or  story, of _Comus_ was probably suggested to Milton by his recollection  of George Peele's _Old Wives' Tale_, which he may have seen on the  stage. The personage of _Comus_ was borrowed from a Latin extravaganza  by a Dutch professor, whose _Comus_ was reprinted at Oxford in  1634, the very year in which Milton wrote his _Mask_. The so-called  tradition collected by Oldys, of the young Egertons, who acted in  _Comus_, having lost themselves in Haywood Forest on their way to  Ludlow, obviously grew out of Milton's poem. However casual the  suggestion, or unpromising the occasion, Milton worked out of it a  strain of poetry such as had never been heard in England before. If  any reader wishes to realise the immense step upon what had gone  before him, which was now made by a young man of twenty-seven, he  should turn over some of the most celebrated of the masks of the  Jacobean period.    We have no information how _Comus_ was received when represented at  Ludlow, but it found a public of readers. For Lawes, who had the MS.  in his hands, was so importuned for copies that, in 1637, he caused an  edition to be printed off. Not surreptitiously; for though Lawes does  not say, in the dedication to Lord Brackley, that he had the author's  leave to print, we are sure that he had it, only from the motto. On  the title page of this edition (1637), is the line,--        Eheu! quid volui miscro mihi! floribus anstrum      Perditus--    The words are Virgil's, but the appropriation of them, and their  application in this \"second intention\" is too exquisite to have been  made by any but Milton.To the poems of the Horton period belong also  the two pieces _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_, and _Lycidas_. He was  probably in the early stage of acquiring the language, when he  superscribed the two first poems with their Italian titles. For there  is no such word as \"Penseroso,\" the adjective formed from \"Pensiero\"  being \"pensieroso\".

But I inherit defective eyesight.\"    \"God speed to you, Rudolph!\" said Jurgen, \"for many others are in  your plight.\"    Then came to Jurgen and the Centaur another boy with the small  blue-eyed person in whom he took delight. And this fat and indolent  looking boy informed them that he and the girl who was with him were  walking in the glaze of the red mustard jar, which Jurgen thought  was gibberish: and the fat boy said that he and the girl had decided  never to grow any older, which Jurgen said was excellent good sense  if only they could manage it.    \"Oh, I can manage that,\" said this fat boy, reflectively, \"if only I  do not find the managing of it uncomfortable.\"    Jurgen for a moment regarded him, and then gravely shook hands.    \"I feel for you,\" said Jurgen, \"for I perceive that you, too, are a  monstrous clever fellow: so life will get the best of you.\"    \"But is not cleverness the main thing, sir?\"    \"Time will show you, my lad,\" says Jurgen, a little sorrowfully.  \"And God speed to you, for many others are in your plight.\"    And a host of boys and girls did Jurgen see in the garden. And all  the faces that Jurgen saw were young and glad and very lovely and  quite heart-breakingly confident, as young persons beyond numbering  came toward Jurgen and passed him there, in the first glow of dawn:  so they all went exulting in the glory of their youth, and  foreknowing life to be a puny antagonist from whom one might take  very easily anything which one desired. And all passed in  couples--\"as though they came from the Ark,\" said Jurgen. But the  Centaur said they followed a precedent which was far older than the  Ark.    \"For in this garden,\" said the Centaur, \"each man that ever lived  has sojourned for a little while, with no company save his  illusions. I must tell you again that in this garden are encountered  none but imaginary creatures. And stalwart persons take their hour  of recreation here, and go hence unaccompanied, to become aldermen  and respected merchants and bishops, and to be admired as captains  upon prancing horses, or even as kings upon tall thrones; each in  his station thinking not at all of the garden ever any more. But now  and then come timid persons, Jurgen, who fear to leave this garden  without an escort: so these must need go hence with one or another  imaginary creature, to guide them about alleys and by-paths, because  imaginary creatures find little nourishment in the public highways,  and shun them. Thus must these timid persons skulk about obscurely  with their diffident and skittish guides, and they do not ever  venture willingly into the thronged places where men get horses and  build thrones.\"    \"And what becomes of these timid persons, Centaur?\"    \"Why, sometimes they spoil paper, Jurgen, and sometimes they spoil  human lives.\"    \"Then are these accursed persons,\" Jurgen considered.    \"You should know best,\" replied the Centaur.    \"Oh, very probably,\" said Jurgen. \"Meanwhile here is one who walks  alone in this garden, and I wonder to see the local by-laws thus  violated.\"    Now Nessus looked at Jurgen for a while without speaking: and in the  eyes of the Centaur was so much of comprehension and compassion that  it troubled Jurgen. For somehow it made Jurgen fidget and consider  this an unpleasantly personal way of looking at anybody.    \"Yes, certainly,\" said the Centaur, \"this woman walks alone. But  there is no help for her loneliness, since the lad who loved this  woman is dead.\"    \"Nessus, I am willing to be reasonably sorry about it. Still, is  there any need of pulling quite such a portentously long face? After  all, a great many other persons have died, off and on: and for  anything I can say to the contrary, this particular young fellow may  have been no especial loss to anybody.\"    Again the Centaur said, \"You should know best.\"          4.    The Dorothy Who Did Not Understand      For now had come to Jurgen and the Centaur a gold-haired woman,  clothed all in white, and walking alone. She was tall, and lovely  and tender to regard: and hers was not the red and white comeliness  of many ladies that were famed for beauty, but rather it had the  even glow of ivory. Her nose was large and high in the bridge, her  flexible mouth was not of the smallest: and yet whatever other  persons might have said, to Jurgen this woman's countenance was in  all things perfect. Perhaps this was because he never saw her as she  was. For certainly the color of her eyes stayed a matter never  revealed to him: gray, blue or green, there was no saying: they  varied as does the sea; but always these eyes were lovely and  friendly and perturbing.    Jurgen remembered that: for Jurgen saw this was Count Emmerick's  second sister, Dorothy la Desiree, whom Jurgen very long ago (a many  years before he met Dame Lisa and set up in business as a  pawnbroker) had hymned in innumerable verses as Heart's Desire.    \"And this is the only woman whom I ever loved,\" Jurgen remembered,  upon a sudden. For people cannot always be thinking of these  matters.    So he saluted her, with such deference as is due to a countess from  a tradesman, and yet with unforgotten tremors waking in his staid  body. But the strangest was yet to be seen, for he noted now that  this was not a handsome woman in middle life but a young girl.    \"I do not understand,\" he said, aloud: \"for you are Dorothy. And yet  it seems to me that you are not the Countess Dorothy who is Heitman  Michael's wife.\"    And the girl tossed her fair head, with that careless lovely gesture  which the Countess had forgotten. \"Heitman Michael is well enough,  for a nobleman, and my brother is at me day and night to marry the  man: and certainly Heitman Michael's wife will go in satin and  diamonds at half the courts of Christendom, with many lackeys to  attend her. But I am not to be thus purchased.\"    \"So you told a boy that I remember, very long ago. Yet you married  Heitman Michael, for all that, and in the teeth of a number of other  fine declarations.\"    \"Oh, no, not I,\" said this Dorothy, wondering. \"I never married  anybody. And Heitman Michael has never married anybody, either, old  as he is. For he is twenty-eight, and looks every day of it! But who  are you, friend, that have such curious notions about me?\"    \"That question I will answer, just as though it were put reasonably.  For surely you perceive I am Jurgen.\"    \"I never knew but one Jurgen. And he is a young man, barely come of  age--\" Then as she paused in speech, whatever was the matter upon  which this girl now meditated, her cheeks were tenderly colored by  the thought of it, and in her knowledge of this thing her eyes took  infinite joy.    And Jurgen understood. He had come back somehow to the Dorothy whom  he had loved: but departed, and past overtaking by the fleet hoofs  of centaurs, was the boy who had once loved this Dorothy, and who  had rhymed of her as his Heart's Desire: and in the garden there was  of this boy no trace. Instead, the girl was talking to a staid and  paunchy pawnbroker, of forty-and-something.    So Jurgen shrugged, and looked toward the Centaur: but Nessus had  discreetly wandered away from them, in search of four-leafed  clovers. Now the east had grown brighter, and its crimson began to  be colored with gold.    \"Yes, I have heard of this other Jurgen,\" says the pawnbroker. \"Oh,  Madame Dorothy, but it was he that loved you!\"    \"No more than I loved him. Through a whole summer have I loved  Jurgen.\"    And the knowledge that this girl spoke a wondrous truth was now to  Jurgen a joy that was keen as pain. And he stood motionless for a  while, scowling and biting his lips.    \"I wonder how long the poor devil loved you! He also loved for a  whole summer, it may be. And yet again, it may be that he loved you  all his life. For twenty years and for more than twenty years I have  debated the matter: and I am as well informed as when I started.\"    \"But, friend, you talk in riddles.\"    \"Is not that customary when age talks with youth? For I am an old  fellow, in my forties: and you, as I know now, are near  eighteen,--or rather, four months short of being eighteen, for it is  August. Nay, more, it is the August of a year I had not looked ever  to see again; and again Dom Manuel reigns over us, that man of iron  whom I saw die so horribly. All this seems very improbable.\"    Then Jurgen meditated for a while. He shrugged.    \"Well, and what could anybody expect me to do about it? Somehow it  has befallen that I, who am but the shadow of what I was, now walk  among shadows, and we converse with the thin intonations of dead  persons. For, Madame Dorothy, you who are not yet eighteen, in this  same garden there was once a boy who loved a girl, with such love as  it puzzles me to think of now. I believe that she loved him. Yes,  certainly it is a cordial to the tired and battered heart which  nowadays pumps blood for me, to think that for a little while, for a  whole summer, these two were as brave and comely and clean a pair of  sweethearts as the world has known.\"    Thus Jurgen spoke. But his thought was that this was a girl whose  equal for loveliness and delight was not to be found between two  oceans. Long and long ago that doubtfulness of himself which was  closer to him than his skin had fretted Jurgen into believing the  Dorothy he had loved was but a piece of his imaginings. But  certainly this girl was real. And sweet she was, and innocent she  was, and light of heart and feet, beyond the reach of any man's  inventiveness. No, Jurgen had not invented her; and it strangely  contented him to know as much.    \"Tell me your story, sir,\" says she, \"for I love all romances.\"    \"Ah, my dear child, but I cannot tell you very well of just what  happened. As I look back, there is a blinding glory of green woods  and lawns and moonlit nights and dance music and"]]]
