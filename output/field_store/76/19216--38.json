Hymn 1:41.  The same; or, The martyrs glorified, Rev. 7. 13 &c.    1 \"These glorious minds, how bright they shine  \"Whence all their white array?  \"How came they to the happy seats  \"Of everlasting day?\"    2 From tort'ring pains to endless joys  On fiery wheels they rode,  And strangely wash'd their raiment white  In Jesus' dying blood.    3 Now they approach a spotless God,  And bow before his throne  Their warbling harps and sacred songs  Adore the Holy One.    4 The unveil'd glories of his face  Amongst his saints reside,  While the rich treasure of his grace  Sees all their wants supply'd.    5 Tormenting thirst shall leave their souls,  And hunger flee as fast;  The fruit of life's immortal tree  Shall be their sweet repast.    6 The Lamb shall lead his heavenly flock  Where living fountains rise,  And love divine shall wipe away  The sorrows of their eyes.      Hymn 1:42.  Divine wrath and mercy, Nahum 1, 2 &c.    1 Adore and tremble, for our God  Is a _consuming fire_;*  His jealous eyes his wrath inflame,  And raise his vengeance higher.    2 Almighty vengeance how it burns!  How bright his fury glows!  Vast magazines of plagues and storms  Lie treasur'd for his foes.    3 Those heaps of wrath by slow degrees  Are forced into a flame,  But kindled, O how fierce they blaze!  And rend all nature's frame.    4 At his approach the mountains flee,  And seek a watery grave;  The frighted sea makes haste away,  And shrinks up every wave.    5 Thro' the wide air the weighty rocks  Are swift as hailstones hurl'd:  Who dares engage his fiery rage  That shakes the solid world?    6 Yet, mighty God, thy sovereign grace  Sits regent on the throne,  The refuge of thy chosen race  When wrath comes rushing down.    7 Thy hand shall on rebellious kings  A fiery tempest pour,  While we beneath thy sheltering wings  Thy just revenge adore.    *Hebrews 12:29.      Hymn 1:43. [Supplement.]  The Christian treasure, 1 Cor. 3. 21.    1 How vast the treasure we possess!  How rich thy bounty, King of Grace!  This world is ours, and worlds to come  Earth is our lodge, and heaven our home.    2 All things are ours, the gifts of God;  The purchase of a Saviour's blood:  While the good Spirit shews us how  To use and to improve them too.    3 If peace and plenty crown my days,  They help, me, Lord, to speak thy praise!  If bread of sorrows be my food,  Those sorrows work my lasting good.    4 I would not change my blest estate  For all the world calls good or great:  And while my faith can keep her hold,  I envy not the sinner's gold.    5 Father, I wait thy daily will;  Thou shalt divide my portion still:  Grant me on earth what seems thee best,  Till death and heaven reveal the rest.      Hymn 1:44. [Supplement.]  The true improvement of life.    1 And is this life prolong'd to me?  Are days and seasons given?  O let me then prepare to be  A fitter heir of heaven.    2 In vain these moments shall not pass,  These golden hours be gone:  Lord, I accept thine offered grace,  I bow before thy throne.    3 Now cleanse my soul from every sin,  By my Redeemer's blood:  Now let my flesh and soul begin  The honours of my God.    4 Let me no more my soul beguile  With sin's deceitful toys:  Let cheerful hope increasing still  Approach to heavenly joys.    5 My thankful lips shall loud proclaim  The wonders of thy praise,  And spread the savour of thy Name  Where'er I spend my days.    6 On earth let my example shine,  And when I leave this state,  May heaven receive this soul of mine  To bliss supremely great.      Hymn 1:45.  The last judgment, Rev. 21. 5-8.    1 See where the great incarnate God  Fills a majestic throne,  While from the skies his awful voice  Bears the last judgment down.    2 [\"I am the first, and I the last,  \"Thro' endless years the same;  \"I AM is my memorial still,  \"And my eternal name.    3 \"Such favours as a God can give  \"My royal grace bestows;  \"Ye thirsty souls come taste the streams  \"Where life and pleasure flows.]    4 [\"The saint that triumphs o'er his sins,  \"I'll own him for a son,  \"The whole creation shall reward  \"The conquests he has won.    5 \"But bloody hands and hearts unclean,  \"And all the lying race,  \"The faithless and the scoffing crew,  \"That spurn at offer'd grace,    6 \"They shall be taken from my sight,  \"Bound fast in iron chains,  \"And headlong plung'd into the lake  \"Where fire and darkness reigns.\"    7 O may I stand before the Lamb,  When earth and seas are fled!  And hear the Judge pronounce my name  With blessings on my head!    8 May I with those for ever dwell  Who here were my delight,  While sinners banish'd down to hell,  No more offend my sight.      Hymn 1:46. [Supplement.]  The privileges of the living above the dead.    1 Awake, my zeal, awake, my love,  To serve my Saviour here below,  In works which perfect saints above  And holy angels cannot do.    2 Awake my charity, to feed  The hungry soul, and clothe the poor:  In heaven are found no sons of need,  There all these duties are no more.    3 Subdue thy passions, O my soul!  Maintain the fight, thy work pursue,  Daily thy rising sins control,  And be thy victories ever new.    4 The land of triumph lies on high,  There are no foes t' encounter there:  Lord, I would conquer till I die,  And finish all the glorious war.    5 Let every flying hour confess  I gain thy gospel fresh renown;  And when my life and labour cease,  May I possess the promis'd crown.      Hymn 1:47. [Supplement.]  Death of kindred improved.    1 Must friends and kindred drop and die?  And helpers be withdrawn?  While sorrow with a weeping eye  Counts up our comforts gone?    2 Be thou our comfort, mighty God!  Our helper and our friend:  Nor leave us in this dangerous road,  Till all our trials end.    3 O may our feet pursue the way  Our pious fathers led!  With love and holy zeal obey  The counsels of the dead.    4 Let us be wean'd from all below,  Let hope our grief expel,  While death invites our souls to go  Where our best kindred dwell.      Hymn 1:48.  The Christian race, Isa. 40. 28-31.    1 Awake, our souls, away, our fears,  Let every trembling thought be gone;  Awake and run the heavenly race,  And put a cheerful courage on.    2 True, 'tis a strait and thorny road,  And mortal spirits tire and faint;  But they forget the mighty God  That feeds the strength of every saint.    3 Thee, mighty God, whose matchless power  Is ever new and ever young,  And firm endures while endless years  Their everlasting circles run.    4 From thee the overflowing spring,  Our souls shall drink a fresh supply,  While such as trust their native strength  Shall melt away, and drop and die.    5 Swift as an eagle cuts the air  We'll mount aloft to thine abode,  On wings of love our souls shall fly,  Nor tire amidst the heavenly road.      Hymn 1:49.  The works of Moses and the Lamb, Rev. 15. 3.    1 How strong thine arm is, mighty God,  Who would not fear thy Name!  Jesus, how sweet thy graces are!  Who would not love the Lamb!    2 He has done more than Moses did,  Our Prophet and our King;  From bonds of hell he freed our souls,  And taught our lips to sing.    3 In the Red-sea by Moses' hand  Th' Egyptian host was drown'd;  But his own blood hides all our sins,  And guilt no more is found.    4 When thro' the desert Israel went,  With manna they were fed;  Our Lord invites us to his flesh,  And calls it living bread.    5 Moses beheld the promis'd land,  Yet never reach'd the place;  But Christ shall bring his followers home  To see his Father's face.    6 Then shall our love and joy be full,  And feel a warmer flame;  And sweeter voices tune the song  Of Moses and the Lamb.      Hymn 1:50.  The song of Zacharias, and the message of John  the Baptist; or, Light and salvation by Jesus Christ,  Luke 1. 68 &c. John 1. 29. 32.    1 Now be the God of Israel bless'd  Who makes his truth appear,  His mighty hand fulfils his word,  And all the oaths he sware.    2 Now he bedews old David's root  With blessings from the skies;  He makes the branch of promise grow,  The promis'd horn arise.    3 [John was the prophet of the Lord  To go before his face,  The herald which our Saviour God  Sent to prepare his ways.    4 He makes the great salvation known,  He speaks of pardon'd sins;  While grace divine and heavenly love  In its own glory shines.    5 \"Behold the Lamb of God,\" he cries,  \"That takes our guilt away:  \"I saw the Spirit o'er his head  \"On his baptizing day.]    6 \"Be every vale exalted high,  \"Sink every mountain low,  \"The proud must stoop, and humble souls  \"Shall his salvation know.    7 \"The heathen realms with Israel's land  \"Shall join in sweet accord;  \"And all that's born of man shall see  \"The glory of the Lord.    8 \"Behold the morning star arise,  \"Ye that in darkness sit;  \"He marks the path that leads to peace,  \"And guides our doubtful feet.\"      Hymn 1:51.  Persevering grace, Jude 24 25.    1 To God the only wise,  Our Saviour and our King,  Let all the saints below the skies  Their humble praises bring.    2 'Tis his almighty love,  His counsel, and his care,  Preserves us safe from sin and death,  And every hurtful snare.    3 He will present our souls  Unblemish'd and complete,  Before the glory of his face,  With joys divinely great.    4 Then all the chosen seed  Shall meet around the throne,  Shall bless the conduct of his grace,  And make his wonders known.    5 To our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13347"],[0,"Wildflowers of the Farm (#5)"],[1,"from a very short underground stem, as  those of the Dandelion do.    Daisies and dandelions are plentiful in Ashmead, and so are the yellow  buttercups. There are, however, not quite so many buttercups as you  might think at first. The real name of what we call the Buttercup is the  Bulbous Crowfoot, and there is also a Meadow Crowfoot in the field. A  third crowfoot is the Corn Crowfoot. To-day we will notice one or two  differences between the two plants we see here.    [Illustration: BULBOUS CROWFOOT.]    The blossoms of both plants have five smooth shining yellow petals.  We see, however, that those of the Bulbous Crowfoot or Buttercup form  a real cup, while the petals of the Meadow Crowfoot spread out almost  flat. The Meadow Crowfoot grows two or three feet high; the Buttercup  is a shorter plant.    The flowers are pretty, but that, I am afraid, is all that we can  say for either of these plants. They are both of them bitter and  unwholesome, and horses and cattle avoid eating them. Some people even  say that to carry a bunch of the stems will make the hands sore; so I  think that we will only look at and admire the flowers where they grow.    The Cowslip is a very different plant indeed and we will not call it a  weed. Even Mr. Hammond is not sorry to see it here; for he is fond of a  glass of the sweet cowslip wine which Mrs. Hammond will make if we busy  ourselves and take home some large basketfuls of the drooping blossoms.  Before we set to work, however, let us examine the plant.    Looking at a stalk of Cowslip blossoms we see something peculiar about  it at once--something unlike the other flowers we have seen. Six or  seven drooping blossoms grow from the stalk we have picked, and they  all grow from the very top of the stalk. The point at the top of the  stalk from which the blossoms grow is called the \"umbel.\"    Each blossom has five yellow petals joined together to form a corolla.  In the centre of the blossom, where these petals meet, each is marked  with a spot of deep orange-red colour. The yellow petals are  comparatively small, and peep out of a long pale green sheath called  the \"calyx.\"    Surely we have seen a flower like this before--the Primrose in the  little coppice. Yes; the Primrose had five pale yellow petals, rather  larger than those of the Cowslip, and joined together to form a corolla;  they grew out of a long green calyx. Also each petal had a spot of  darker yellow in the centre of the blossom. The leaves of both the  Primrose and the Cowslip are much wrinkled, and they grow from a short  underground stem.    But, you say, each Primrose blossom grew alone on the top of a long  stem. Yes, but if we had dug up a Primrose plant, we should have found  that several flower stems grew from the same point--the top of a very  short stem which hardly appeared above the ground. They grew from an  umbel, and the Primrose is closely related to the Cowslip. The  difference is that the blossoms of the Primrose grow on _long_ stems  from a _short_-stemmed umbel. Those of the Cowslip grow on _short_ stems  from a _long_-stemmed umbel.          CHAPTER VII    IN THE HAY-FIELD      Here we are in the hay-field at the end of June. It is not really the  hay-field yet, but it will be so as soon as the grass is cut for hay.  This will be done in a few days, so we must lose no time if we wish to  look at some of the flowers before they are cut down.    We must not stroll all over this field as we did in Ashmead, for the  long grass should not be trampled down, or it will be difficult for the  machine to cut. Quite near the gate, however, are plenty of flowers, and  we shall find others if we step carefully along the side of the hedge.    We will look first at those flowers which are most important to the  farmer, the flowers of the grass. We saw, you remember, that the grass  has flowers just as the Rose and the Wallflower have. If you had thought  that the flowers of all grass would be alike, you see now that you were  quite mistaken; there are many different grass flowers here.    [Illustration: SECTION OF GRASS STEM.]    Not only are the flowers different, but so are the stems, and also the  leaves or blades. Mr. Hammond could come into the field in early spring  or autumn, when the grass is not in flower, and could tell you to which  kind of grass any blade belonged. To-day we shall easily distinguish the  different kinds of grasses by their flowers, though we will also notice  differences in their stems and leaves.    Let us pick a stem or culm of grass. We see that the greater part of it  is hollow; but at intervals there are joints, and here the stem is  solid. From each joint grows a leaf-sheath which is wrapped round the  stem for a little distance above the joint. Out of each sheath grows a  leaf. All grass leaves are long and narrow compared with those of most  other plants, but some grass leaves are longer and narrower than others.    Now for a flower. The stem which we have picked is the stem of perennial  Rye Grass. The blossom, we see, consists of several small spikelets;  there are eighteen on our stem. They grow alternately on two opposite  sides of the stem, first one on one side, then one on the other. They  have no stalk of their own; they are sessile or seated on the stem. As  the spikelets are flat and grow on two sides of the stem only, each stem  looks as if it had been pressed in a book, as perhaps you have sometimes  pressed flowers.    The leaves are dark green, glossy and shining. On the under side of each  leaf there is a prominent rib which extends the whole length. This rib  is one of the signs by which Mr. Hammond can tell a blade of Rye Grass  at once without seeing the flower.    This is one of the farmer's most useful grasses. It forms a close thick  carpet or sward, and, the more it is trodden on by animals grazing, the  better it seems to thrive.    Here is another excellent grass, with a flower quite different in  appearance from the last. It is called Timothy Grass. It was first  cultivated in America by a man named Timothy Hanson, and it is now  always known by his Christian name. Mr. Hammond knows this, and now you  know it too; but a good many farmers who have plenty of Timothy Grass in  their fields do not know the reason of its name.    [Illustration: COWSLIP.]    [Illustration: HONEYSUCKLE AND WILD ROSE.]    [Illustration: GRASSES. 1. Cocksfoot; 2. Sweet vernal; 3. Meadow  foxtail; 4. Common Timothy; 5. Tufted hair; 6. Common rye grass.]    The spikelets of Timothy are very small and grow in dense clusters at  the end of the stem, so that the blossom forms a kind of tail. Indeed  Timothy is sometimes called Meadow Catstail, a name which gives a very  good idea of its appearance. This cluster or tail of spikelets is green  and also rather rough to the touch. Notice these two points about it; we  shall see the reason presently. The green leaves have a greyish tint and  are broader than many grass leaves. When cut and made into hay, the  leaves are rather stiff and hard.    Timothy grows in good thick clumps, but does not make a very spreading  sward. Moist weather suits it best, though it can stand a dry summer  fairly well. It is a late grass. Other grasses in the field are in full  flower to-day, but there are only a few ears of Timothy to be seen; its  flowering-time is July. In one way it is a valuable grass for hay; it is  heavy, and hay is always sold by weight. On the other hand Timothy hay  is rather hard.    Now here is a grass something like Timothy, yet different in several  ways. It is Meadow Foxtail. The ear formed by the cluster of spikelets  is of the same shape as an ear of Timothy, like a round tail slightly  pointed. But the ear of Timothy was green, while this is a beautiful  silvery grey. Timothy was rough; the ear of Meadow Foxtail is very soft  and silky to the touch. The silkiness and the silvery grey colour are  given to the ear by a soft hair called the \"awn\" which grows from each  spikelet. The leaves are broad and juicy, and there are many of them.    Meadow Foxtail, unlike Timothy, is an early grass; you may find it  in flower in April. An early grass is always valuable to the farmer,  who wants herbage for his sheep and cattle after the long winter.  The Foxtail, moreover, is a spreading grass. Some of its stems are  prostrate; they do not stand upright but creep along the ground. From  these prostrate stems fresh roots grow and produce fresh plants. Thus  Meadow Foxtail makes a good sward.    Another useful grass is Cocksfoot. Each culm has four or five thick  clusters of spikelets growing on small stalks of their own. The clusters  grow from the culm in a way which reminds us of the claw of a fowl; that  is the reason of the name. Cocksfoot is a tall and quick growing plant,  and both the stem and flower feel rough and hard. The blue-green leaves  are very juicy. The root goes deep into the soil, so that this grass  resists drought well.    We must notice the Sweet Vernal Grass, though there is not much of it in  the field; for this grass, when it is dry, gives out much of the sweet  scent we smell in or near a hay-field. If we chew a stalk, we notice the  scent ourselves, and animals like the pleasant flavour which it gives to  hay. Though it is an early grass it also lasts till late in the autumn.  The spikelets make a cluster or tail at the end of the stalk, but they  do not grow so closely together as those of the Timothy and Meadow  Foxtail.    Look at this Tufted Hair Grass. It is very pretty, perhaps one of the  prettiest grasses we have seen; but the farmer looks upon it as a weed.  It has a large and spreading head of flower; the spikelets grow on  stems, and become gradually smaller towards the top of the stalk. The  flower is purple, with a shining silvery light upon it. It grows in  thick clumps or tussocks, and cattle do not care about the leaves.          CHAPTER VIII    IN THE HAY-FIELD (_contin"]]]
