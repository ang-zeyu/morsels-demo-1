Volume 12, No. 332, (#5)"],[1,"upon the water, than in houses on  shore, the younger and male children have a _hollow ball_ of some light  material attached constantly to their necks, so that in their frequent  falls overboard, they are not in danger. Had we not read this in a grave,  philosophical work, we should have thought it a joke upon poor humanity,  or at best a piece of poetical justice, and that the hollow ball, &c.  represented the head--fools being oftener inheritors of good fortune than  their wiser companions. As the great secret in swimming is to keep the  chest as full of air as possible, perhaps the great art of living is to  keep the head a _vacuum_, a state \"adapted to the meanest capacity.\" But  had kind Nature supplied us with an air-bladder at the neck, the heaviest  of us might have floated to eternity, Leander's swimming across the  Hellespont no wonder at all, and the drags of the Humane Society be  converted into halters for the suspension and recovery of old offenders  and small debts.    _A wet day in London_ is what every gentleman who does not read, or does  not recollect, Shakspeare, calls _a bore_,[3] and every lady decides to be  a _nuisance_. Abroad, everything is discomfiture; at home all is fidget  and uneasiness. What is called a smart shower, sweeps off a whole stand of  hackney-coaches in a few seconds, and leaves a few leathern conveniences  called cabriolets, so that your only alternative is that of being soaked  to the skin, or pitched out, taken up, bled, and carried home in \"a state  of insensibility.\" The Spanish proverb, \"it never rains but it pours\" soon  comes to pass, and every street is momentarily washed as clean as the most  diligent housemaid could desire. Every little shelter is crowded with  solitary, houseless-looking people, who seem employed in taking  descriptions of each other for the _Hue and Cry_, or police gazette. On  the pavement may probably be seen some wight who with more than political  obstinacy, resolves to \"weather the storm,\" with slouched hat, which acts  upon the principle of capillary attraction, drenched coat, and boots in  which the feet work like pistons in tannin: now                               The reeling clouds,    Stagger with dizzy poise, as doubting yet,    Which master to obey.    Company, in such cases, usually increases the misery. Your wife, with a  new dress, soon loses her temper and its beauty; the children splash you  and their little frilled continuations; and ill-humour is the order of the  day; for on such occasions you cannot slip into a tavern, and follow Dean  Swift's example:      On rainy days alone I dine,    Upon a chick, and pint of wine:    On rainy days I dine alone,    And pick my chicken to the bone.    Go you to the theatre in what is called a wet season, and perhaps after  sitting through a dull five-act tragedy and two farces, your first  solicitude is about the weather, and as if to increase the vexation, you  cannot see the sky for a heavy portico or blind; then the ominous cry of  \"carriage, your honour\"--\"what terrible event does this portend\"--and you  have to pick your way, with your wife like Cinderella after the ball,  through an avenue of link-boys and cadmen,[4] and hear your name and  address bawled out to all the thieves that happen to be present. Or,  perchance, the coachman, whose inside porosity is well indicated by his  bundle of coats, as Dr. Kitchiner says, is labouring under \"the  unwholesome effervescence of the hot and rebellious liquors which have  been taken to revive the flagging spirits,\" and like a sponge, absorbs  liquids, owing to the pressure of the surrounding air.        [3] This expression is not the exclusive property of Oxford,      Cambridge, or the Horse Guards. See Shakspeare's Henry VIII, where      the Duke of Buckingham says of Wolsey, \"He _bores_ me with some      trick;\" like another great man, the Cardinal must have been a great      bore.        [4] Towards the close of the last opera season we heard a ludicrous      mistake. One of these fellows bawled out \"the Duke of Grafton's      carriage;\" \"No,\" replied the gentleman, smiling, and correcting the      officious cadman, who had caught at the noble euphony, \"Mr.      Crafter's.\"    That we are attached to wet weather, a single comparison with our  neighbours will abundantly prove. A Frenchman seldom stirs abroad without  his _parapluie_; notwithstanding he is, compared with an Englishman, an  _al fresco_ animal, eating, drinking, dancing, reading, and seeing  plays--all out of doors. A shower is more effectual in clearing the streets  of Paris than those of London. People flock into _cafes_, the arcades of  the Palais Royal, and splendid covered passages; and as soon as the rain  ceases, scores of planks are thrown across the gutters in the _centre_ of  the streets, which species of _pontooning_ is rewarded by the sous and  centimes of the passengers. In Switzerland too, where the annual fall of  rain is 40 inches, the streets are always washed clean, an effect which is  admirably represented in the view of Unterseen, now exhibiting at the  _Diorama_. But in Peru, the Andes intercept the clouds, and the constant  heat over sandy deserts prevents clouds from forming, so that there is no  rain. Here it never shines but it burns.    _Wet-weather in the country_ is, however, a still greater infliction upon  the sensitive nerves. There is no club-house, coffee-room, billiard-room,  or theatre, to slip into; and if caught in a shower you must content  yourself with the arcades of Nature, beneath which you enjoy the  unwished-for luxury of a shower bath. Poor Nature is drenched and drowned;  perhaps never better described than by that inveterate bard of Cockaigne,  Captain Morris:      Oh! it settles the stomach when nothing is seen    But an ass on a common, or goose on a green.    We were once overtaken by such weather in a pedestrian tour through the  Isle of Wight, when just then about to leave Niton for a geological  excursion to the Needles. Reader, if you remember, the Sandrock Hotel is  one of the most rural establishments in the island. Think of our being  shut up there for six hours, with a thin duodecimo guide of less than 100  pages, which some mischievous fellow had made incomplete. How often did we  read and re-read every line, and trace every road in the little map. At  length we set off on our return to Newport. The rain partially ceased, and  we were attracted out of the road to Luttrell's Tower, whence we were  compelled to seek shelter in a miserable public-house in a village about  three miles distant. No spare bed, a wretched smoky fire; and hard beer,  and poor cheese, called Isle of Wight rock, were all the accommodation our  host could provide. His parlour was just painted; but half-a-dozen  sectarian books and an ill-toned flute amused us for an hour; then we  again started, in harder rain than ever, for Newport. Compelled to halt  twice, we saw some deplorable scenes of cottage misery, almost enough to  put us out of conceit of rusticity, till after crossing a bleak, dreary  heath, we espied the distant light of Newport. Never had we beheld gas  light with such ecstasy, not even on the first lighting of St. James's  Park. It was the eve of the Cowes' regatta, and the town was full; but our  luggage was there, and we were secure. A delicious supper at the Bugle,  and liberal outpourings of Newport ale, at length put us in good humour  with our misfortunes; but on the following morning we hastened on to Ryde,  and thus passed by steam to Portsmouth; having resolved to defer our  geological expedition to that day twelve months. Perhaps we may again  touch on this little journey. We have done for the present, lest our  number should interrupt the enjoyment of any of the thousand pedestrians  who are at this moment tracking      The slow ascending hill, the lofty wood    That mantles o'er its brow.    or coasting the castled shores and romantic cliffs of Vectis, or the Isle  of Wight.    PHILO.           *       *       *       *       *        MANNERS & CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS      DUELS IN FRANCE.      Duels had at one time become so frequent in France as to require  particular enactments for their prevention; as, for example, when the debt  about which any dispute occurred did not amount to five-pence. The  regulation of the mode in which the barbarous custom might be maintained  had engaged the attention of several of the French kings. In 1205, Philip  Augustus restricted the length of the club, with which single combat was  then pursued, to three feet; and in 1260, Saint Louis abolished the  practice of deciding civil matters by duelling. With the revival of  literature and of the arts, national manners became ameliorated, and duels  necessarily declined. It was still, however, not unusual for the French to  promote or to behold those single combats over which the pages of romance  have thrown a delusive charm, and which were, in early times, hallowed, in  the opinion of the vulgar, by their accompanying superstitious ceremonies.  When any quarrel had been referred to this mode of decision, the parties  met on the appointed day, and frequently in an open space, overshadowed by  the walls of a convent, which thus lent its sanction to the bloody scene.  From day-break the people were generally employed in erecting scaffolds  and stages, and in placing themselves upon the towers and ramparts of the  adjacent buildings. About noon, the cavalcade was usually seen to arrive  at the door of the lists; then the herald cried, \"Let the appellant  appear,\" and his summons was answered by the entrance of the challenger,  armed cap-a-pie, the escutcheon suspended from his neck, his visor lowered,  and an image of some national saint in his hand. He was allowed to pass  within the lists, and conducted to his tent. The accused person likewise  appeared, and was led in the same manner to his tent. Then the herald, in  his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10852"],[0,"Hardy Ornamental Flowering Trees and Shrubs (#5)"],[1," insure its growth in this  country. Hailing from Japan, it cannot be reckoned as very hardy, but  treated as a wall plant this pretty evergreen does well and flowers  freely. It can, however, be said that it is equally hardy with some  of the finer kinds of Hydrangea, to which genus it is nearly allied.      CARPENTERIA.    CARPENTERIA CALIFORNICA.--Sierra Nevada, California, 1880. This is  undoubtedly one of the most distinct and beautiful of hardy shrubs.  That it is perfectly hardy in England and Ireland recently-conducted  experiments conclusively prove, as plants have stood unprotected  through the past unusually severe winters with which this country has  been visited. When in full bloom the pure-white flowers, resembling  those of the Japanese Anemone, render it of great beauty, while the  light gray leaves are of themselves sufficient to make the shrub one of  particular attraction. The Carpenteria is nearly related to the Mock  Orange (Philadelphus), grows about 10 feet in height, with lithe and  slender branches, and light gray leaves. The flowers, which are pure  white with a bunch of yellow stamens, and sweet-scented, are produced  usually in fives at the branch-tips, and contrast markedly with the  long and light green foliage. It grows and flowers with freedom almost  anywhere, but is all the better for wall protection. From cuttings or  suckers it is readily increased.      CARYOPTERIS.    CARYOPTERIS MASTACANTHUS.--China and Japan, 1844. This is a neat-growing  Chinese shrub, and of value for its pretty flowers that are produced  late in the autumn. It must be ranked as fairly hardy, having stood  through the winters of Southern England unprotected; but it is just as  well to give so choice a shrub the slight protection afforded by a  wall. The leaves are neat, thickly-arranged, and hoary, while the whole  plant is twiggy and of strict though by no means formal growth. Flowers  lavender-blue, borne at the tips of the shoots, and appearing in  succession for a considerable length of time. Light, sandy peat would  seem to suit it well, at least in such it grows and flowers freely.      CASSANDRA.    CASSANDRA CALYCULATA (_syn Andromeda calyculata_).--North America,  1748. This is a handsome species from the Virginian swamps, but one  that is rarely seen in a very satisfactory condition in this country.  It grows about 18 inches high, with lanceolate dull-green leaves, and  pretty pinky-white flowers, individually large and produced abundantly.  For the banks of a pond or lake it is a capital shrub and very  effective, particularly if massed in groups of from a dozen to twenty  plants in each. There are several nursery forms, of which A. calyculata  minor is the best and most distinct.      CASSINIA.    CASSINIA FULVIDA (_syn Diplopappus chrysophyllus_).--New Zealand. This  is a neat-growing and beautiful shrub, the rich yellow stems and under  sides of the leaves imparting quite a tint of gold to the whole plant.  The flowers are individually small, but the whole head, which is  creamy-white, is very effective, and contrasts strangely with the  golden sheen of this beautiful shrub. It is inclined to be of rather  upright growth, is stout and bushy, and is readily increased from  cuttings planted in sandy soil in the open border. Probably in the  colder parts of the country this charming shrub might not prove  perfectly hardy, but all over England and Ireland it seems to be quite  at home. The flowers are produced for several months of the year, but  are at their best about mid-November, thus rendering the shrub of still  further value. It grows freely in sandy peaty soil of a light nature.      CASSIOPE.    CASSIOPE FASTIGIATA (_syn Andromeda fastigiata_) and C. TETRAGONA (_syn  Andromeda tetragona_) are small-growing species, only suitable for rock  gardening--the former of neat upright habit, with large pinky-white  bells all along the stems; and the latter of bushy growth, with square  stems and small white flowers.      CASTANEA.    CASTANEA SATIVA (_syn C. vesca_ and _C. vulgaris_).--Sweet Spanish  Chestnut. Asia Minor. Few persons who have seen this tree as an  isolated specimen and when in full flower would feel inclined to  exclude it from our list. The long, cylindrical catkins, of a  yellowish-green colour, are usually borne in such abundance that the  tree is, during the month of June, one of particular interest and  beauty. So common a tree needs no description, but it may be well to  mention that there are several worthy varieties, and which flower  almost equally well with the parent tree.      CATALPA.    CATALPA BIGNONIOIDES.--Indian Bean. North America, 1798. When in  full bloom this is a remarkable and highly ornamental tree, the  curiously-marked flowers and unusually large, bronzy-tinted foliage  being distinct from those of almost any other in cultivation. That it  is not, perhaps, perfectly hardy in every part of the country is to be  regretted, but the numerous fine old specimens that are to be met with  all over the country point out that there need be little to fear when  assigning this pretty and uncommon tree a position in our parks and  gardens. The flowers, produced in spikes at the branch-tips, are white,  tinged with violet and speckled with purple and yellow in the throat.  Individually the flowers are of large size and very ornamental, and,  being produced freely, give the tree a bright and pleasing appearance  when at their best. Usually the tree attains to a height of 30 feet in  this country, with rather crooked and ungainly branches, and large  heart-shaped leaves that are downy beneath. It flourishes well on any  free soil, and is an excellent smoke-resisting tree. C. bignonioides  aurea is a decided variety, that differs mainly in the leaves being of  a desirable golden tint.    C. BUNGEI and C. KAEMPFERI, natives of China and Japan, are hardly  to be relied upon, being of tender growth, and, unless in the most  favoured situations, suffer from our severe winters. They resemble our  commonly cultivated tree.    C. SPECIOSA.--United States, 1879. The Western Catalpa is more erect  and taller of growth than C. bignonioides. The flowers too are larger,  and of purer white, and with the throat markings of purple and yellow  more distinct and not inclined to run into each other. Leaves large,  heart-shaped, tapering to a point, of a light pleasing green and soft  to the touch. It flowers earlier, and is more hardy than the former.      CEANOTHUS.    CEANOTHUS AMERICANUS.--New Jersey Tea. North America, 1713. A shrub of  4 feet in height, with deep green serrated leaves, that are 2 inches  long and pubescent on the under sides. Flowers white, in axillary  panicles, and produced in great abundance. This is one of the hardiest  species, but succeeds best when afforded wall protection.    C. AZUREUS.--Mexico, 1818. This species, though not hardy enough for  every situation, is yet sufficiently so to stand unharmed as a wall  plant. It grows from 10 feet to 12 feet high, with deep-green leaves  that are hoary on the under sides. The flowers, which are borne in  large, axillary panicles, are bright blue, and produced in June and the  following months. In a light, dry soil and sunny position this shrub  does well as a wall plant, for which purpose it is one of the most  ornamental. There are several good nursery forms, of which the following  are amongst the best:--C. azureus Albert Pettitt, C. azureus albidus,  C. azureus Arnddii, one of the best, C. azureus Gloire de Versailles,  and C. azureus Marie Simon.    C. CUNEATUS (_syn C. verrucosus_).--California, 1848. This is another  half-hardy species that requires wall protection, which may also be  said of C. Veitchianus, one of the most beautiful of the family, with  dense clusters of rich blue flowers and a neat habit of growth.    C. DENTATUS.--California, 1848. With deeply-toothed, shining-green  leaves, and deep blue, abundantly-produced flowers, this is a  well-known wall plant that succeeds in many parts of the country,  particularly within the influence of the sea. It commences flowering in  May, and frequently continues until frosts set in. It is a very  desirable species, that in favoured situations will grow to fully 10  feet high, and with a spread laterally of nearly the same dimensions.    C. PAPILLOSUS.--California, 1848. This is a straggling bush, with  small, blunt leaves, and panicles of pale blue flowers on long  footstalks. A native of California and requiring wall protection.    C. RIGIDUS.--Another Californian species, is of upright, stiff growth,  a sub-evergreen, with deep purple flowers produced in April and May.    There are other less hardy kinds, including C. floribundus, C.  integerrimus, C. velutinus, and C. divaricatus.      CEDRELA.    CEDRELA SINENSIS (_syn Ailanthus flavescens_).--China, 1875. This is a  fast growing tree, closely resembling the Ailanthus, and evidently  quite as hardy. It has a great advantage over that tree, in that the  flowers have an agreeable odour, those of the Ailanthus being somewhat  sickly and unpleasant. The flowers are individually small, but arranged  in immense hanging bunches like those of Koelreuteria paniculata, and  being pleasantly scented are rendered still the more valuable. The  whole plant has a yellow hue, and the roots have a peculiar reddish  colour, and very unlike those of the Ailanthus, which are white.      CELASTRUS.    CELASTRUS SCANDENS.--Climbing Waxwork, or Bitter Sweet. North America,  1736. When planted in rich, moist soil, this soon forms an attractive  mass of twisting and twining growths, with distinct glossy foliage  in summer and brilliant scarlet fruit in autumn. The flowers are  inconspicuous, the chief beauty of the shrub being the show of fruit,  which resembles somewhat those of the Spindle Tree (Euonymus), and to  which it is nearly allied. A native of North America, it grows from 12  feet to 15 feet high, and is"]]]
