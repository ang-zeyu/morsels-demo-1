That it was added to we already know. But documentary  as well as structural evidence comes to our aid. The first is supplied  by the records of Bishop Neville's episcopate; the next by the  researches of modern archaeology. Professor Willis has shown in his  remarks upon the structure of the piers at the time of the collapse of  the mediaeval tower and spire in 1861, that these had not been rebuilt  at a date later than the twelfth century. But Mr. Sharpe [6], writing  to Professor Willis seven years before the occurrence, indicates his  discovery--from a close examination of the structure then  existing--that before the upper part of the central tower was rebuilt  in the thirteenth century the earlier arches at the crossing which  were to support it had been taken down, and probably a large part of  the piers carrying them. And that, though the twelfth-century  voussoirs were re-used others of a fine grained stone were inserted  among them to strengthen the arches, or as a substitute for some of  the rougher sandstones that could not be used again. By this means,  then, the original form and detail of the twelfth-century arches was  preserved, so that the drawings representing the measured studies of  the building, which were Sir Gilbert Scott's principal authority upon  which to base his restoration of this portion of the tower, were made  from work which had already been once rebuilt. But why was this part  of the church rebuilt, and by whom? Two alternative suggestions for  the reason have been offered.      [5] Walcott, p. 15.    [6] Author of \"Architectural Parallels.\"    Evidently, if the upper part of the tower did not fall, it is  apparently certain that it was reconstructed, in order to carry the  additional weight of the larger tower. But in examining the  documentary evidence offered us, we find some further help. The  teaching of archaeology shows that the portion of this tower above the  main supporting arches and up to the bottom of the parapet was  executed between 1225 and 1325--that is, it was finished not very long  after the new part of the south-west tower was completed.    The cathedral statutes show that between the years 1244-1247 Bishop  Ralph Neville was much concerned about a \"stone tower\" which he wished  to see completed. They tell us, too, that the same bishop had himself  expended one hundred and thirty marks upon the fabric, [7] and that his  executors, besides releasing a debt of L60 due to him and spent on the  bell-tower, gave L140 to the fabric of the church. Ralph died in 1244,  so it is concluded that the work in which he was so interested was  none other than the central or bell-tower of the cathedral, and that  the earlier tower, with its supporting arches, must have fallen, else  it is not likely that the work would have been rebuilt from below the  spring of these arches before the new superstructure could be added;  for we are obliged to take the customs of mediaeval builders into  consideration in any attempt to sift the evidence concerning their  work--and they were before all things practical. The claims of  structure, the motives of common-sense, rather than abstract and  aesthetic ideals of beauty, were the prime causes at work in the  evolution of their great art. Here they found themselves faced by a  practical need--the rebuilding of a fallen tower. Its reconstruction  was necessary to the completeness and stability of the building; so  they put it up, applying new and increasing knowledge and skill in the  execution of the work. They did their best, and the result was  something not only strong and structural, but beautiful. But, as time  has shown, it would have been better had they been less respectful of  the valueless legacy bequeathed to them in the piers, though in  defence of their sagacity it must be admitted that what they deemed  sufficient for the purpose then in view was able to carry their own  tower for five hundred years in safety, and not only this, but, in  addition, a spire, the erection of which they may not have thought of  when the restoration was begun.      [7] Walcott, p. 15.    There is another interesting fact which may be mentioned before  quitting this part of our inquiry. Professor Willis found that there  still existed in 1861 one of the old wooden trusses of the roof over  the west bay of the chancel. It was a specimen of mediaeval carpentry  six hundred and fifty years old, and it had not, as he showed, been  unframed since the fire of 1186-1187. The timbers composing it had  been slightly charred by the flames, and some of the lead which  covered the burning roof had run in its melted condition into the  mortices of the framing. [8]      [8] See Willis, p. x.: Introduction.    In the admirable plan and sections which Professor Willis prepared to  illustrate his work upon the history of the fabric it is possible to  see at once what work had been done during the different stages of  development. The work finished by the end of the thirteenth century  changed the earlier church of the eleventh and twelfth centuries in  its essential arrangements into the church we see to-day.    We have now briefly to review the changes produced in the plan of the  cathedral. There were those effected as an immediate consequence of  the fire, and others which were more the result of the continued  energy of the thirteenth-century builders. The most remarkable one was  that which converted the French chevet, or group of apses, into the  more familiar square, and characteristically English, eastern  termination. The apsidal chapels on the east side of each arm of the  transept had disappeared to make room for others of a different shape  and size. The other chapels at the east remained the same in number;  but towards the close of the thirteenth century the lady-chapel had  been lengthened, and the aisles of the choir, being continued  eastward, ended in small chapels to the north and south of the central  one. The other changes were those caused by the addition of chapels  off the south and north aisles of the nave. The addition of the south  and north porches, and the sacristy next to the south arm of the  transept, were the only other alterations, if we except the addition  of buttresses, which had been made in the original arrangement up to  the beginning of the fourteenth century.    [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL FROM THE SOUTH-EAST, ABOUT 1836. _From  Winkles's Cathedral Churches_.]    Though the quest may not be followed here, it would be interesting to  try and trace the cause of this desire to add chapels to mediaeval  buildings. It had during the thirteenth century already become a clear  indication of that gradual movement affecting the arrangement of  churches which originated in the introduction of new doctrinal ideas.  The particular set of ideas which caused such additions as these had  now become a part of the common property of popular thought,  imagination, and reverent superstition. The earlier designers and  builders had not been taught to consider these features essential to  the complete equipment of a church planned in accordance with  primitive usages; they were a simple example of the influence which  doctrine exercised upon the history of art and the scope of  archaeological inquiry.    The course of history that has been followed has led us through the  maze of some events which served to produce the cathedral that stands  among us now. The later centuries will not require as much attention,  since they afford but little material, comparatively, with which we  need delay; for the industry expended upon the fabric since this time  has produced little change in the general appearance of the building.  With the approach of the fourteenth century we meet a period when the  peculiarities of the work of the thirteenth century had become merged  in transitional forms, and from this application of ever-developing  ideas to accepted working principles came the well-known character  which English architecture displayed during that time. It was native  by parentage and birth; it represented the life which prevailed in the  ideas which were then the common currency. By it the ideals of thought  and imagination were expressed, until, later, they were represented in  other forms of art. At Chichester an early indication of the changed  treatment of older methods that was being developed experimentally is  shown by the portion which was added to the lady-chapel during the  episcopate of Gilbert de Sancto Leophardo. The architects and  master-builders devised for him the two new eastern bays complete,  together with the larger windows that were inserted in the walls of  that part of the chapel already built. Here again, as in the work set  in motion by his successor, the designers and builders made no attempt  to add these new portions in imitation of earlier ones. Then it was  Bishop Langton who, between 1305 and 1337, spent L340 \"on a certain  wall and windows on the south side, which he constructed from the  ground upwards.\" [9] This work is principally to be seen in the great  south window of the transept, under which he provided for himself a  \"founder's\" tomb. In the gable above a rose window was inserted,  following the example of that earlier one in the east end of the  presbytery. The chapter-house above the treasury, or sacristy, was  also added when the new windows were inserted in the lower walls.  About the same time the doorway to the nave within the western porch  was constructed.      [9] Bishop Reade's Register.    [Illustration: THE SOUTH TRANSEPT, ABOUT 1836. _From Winkle's Cathedral  Churches_.]    Walcott shows by his study of the early statutes of the cathedral that  \"in 1359 the first fruits of the prebendal stalls were granted to the  fabric; and in 1391, one-twentieth of all their rents was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13334"],[0,"The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce — Volume 2: In the Midst of Life: Tales of (#5)"],[1,"in the bed of the stream lay but a step or a leap apart, he  made his way across and fell again upon the rear-guard of his imaginary  foe, putting all to the sword.    Now that the battle had been won, prudence required that he withdraw to  his base of operations. Alas; like many a mightier conqueror, and like  one, the mightiest, he could not                               curb the lust for war,    Nor learn that tempted Fate will leave the loftiest star.    Advancing from the bank of the creek he suddenly found himself  confronted with a new and more formidable enemy: in the path that he was  following, sat, bolt upright, with ears erect and paws suspended before  it, a rabbit! With a startled cry the child turned and fled, he knew not  in what direction, calling with inarticulate cries for his mother,  weeping, stumbling, his tender skin cruelly torn by brambles, his little  heart beating hard with terror--breathless, blind with tears--lost in  the forest! Then, for more than an hour, he wandered with erring feet  through the tangled undergrowth, till at last, overcome by fatigue, he  lay down in a narrow space between two rocks, within a few yards of the  stream and still grasping his toy sword, no longer a weapon but a  companion, sobbed himself to sleep. The wood birds sang merrily above  his head; the squirrels, whisking their bravery of tail, ran barking  from tree to tree, unconscious of the pity of it, and somewhere far away  was a strange, muffled thunder, as if the partridges were drumming in  celebration of nature's victory over the son of her immemorial  enslavers. And back at the little plantation, where white men and black  were hastily searching the fields and hedges in alarm, a mother's heart  was breaking for her missing child.    Hours passed, and then the little sleeper rose to his feet. The chill of  the evening was in his limbs, the fear of the gloom in his heart. But he  had rested, and he no longer wept. With some blind instinct which  impelled to action he struggled through the undergrowth about him and  came to a more open ground--on his right the brook, to the left a  gentle acclivity studded with infrequent trees; over all, the gathering  gloom of twilight. A thin, ghostly mist rose along the water. It  frightened and repelled him; instead of recrossing, in the direction  whence he had come, he turned his back upon it, and went forward toward  the dark inclosing wood. Suddenly he saw before him a strange moving  object which he took to be some large animal--a dog, a pig--he could not  name it; perhaps it was a bear. He had seen pictures of bears, but knew  of nothing to their discredit and had vaguely wished to meet one. But  something in form or movement of this object--something in the  awkwardness of its approach--told him that it was not a bear, and  curiosity was stayed by fear. He stood still and as it came slowly on  gained courage every moment, for he saw that at least it had not the  long, menacing ears of the rabbit. Possibly his impressionable mind was  half conscious of something familiar in its shambling, awkward gait.  Before it had approached near enough to resolve his doubts he saw that  it was followed by another and another. To right and to left were many  more; the whole open space about him was alive with them--all moving  toward the brook.    They were men. They crept upon their hands and knees. They used their  hands only, dragging their legs. They used their knees only, their arms  hanging idle at their sides. They strove to rise to their feet, but fell  prone in the attempt. They did nothing naturally, and nothing alike,  save only to advance foot by foot in the same direction. Singly, in  pairs and in little groups, they came on through the gloom, some halting  now and again while others crept slowly past them, then resuming their  movement. They came by dozens and by hundreds; as far on either hand as  one could see in the deepening gloom they extended and the black wood  behind them appeared to be inexhaustible. The very ground seemed in  motion toward the creek. Occasionally one who had paused did not again  go on, but lay motionless. He was dead. Some, pausing, made strange  gestures with their hands, erected their arms and lowered them again,  clasped their heads; spread their palms upward, as men are sometimes  seen to do in public prayer.    Not all of this did the child note; it is what would have been noted by  an elder observer; he saw little but that these were men, yet crept like  babes. Being men, they were not terrible, though unfamiliarly clad. He  moved among them freely, going from one to another and peering into  their faces with childish curiosity. All their faces were singularly  white and many were streaked and gouted with red. Something in this--  something too, perhaps, in their grotesque attitudes and movements--  reminded him of the painted clown whom he had seen last summer in the  circus, and he laughed as he watched them. But on and ever on they  crept, these maimed and bleeding men, as heedless as he of the dramatic  contrast between his laughter and their own ghastly gravity. To him it  was a merry spectacle. He had seen his father's negroes creep upon their  hands and knees for his amusement--had ridden them so, \"making believe\"  they were his horses. He now approached one of these crawling figures  from behind and with an agile movement mounted it astride. The man sank  upon his breast, recovered, flung the small boy fiercely to the ground  as an unbroken colt might have done, then turned upon him a face that  lacked a lower jaw--from the upper teeth to the throat was a great red  gap fringed with hanging shreds of flesh and splinters of bone. The  unnatural prominence of nose, the absence of chin, the fierce eyes, gave  this man the appearance of a great bird of prey crimsoned in throat and  breast by the blood of its quarry. The man rose to his knees, the child  to his feet. The man shook his fist at the child; the child, terrified  at last, ran to a tree near by, got upon the farther side of it and took  a more serious view of the situation. And so the clumsy multitude  dragged itself slowly and painfully along in hideous pantomime--moved  forward down the slope like a swarm of great black beetles, with never a  sound of going--in silence profound, absolute.    Instead of darkening, the haunted landscape began to brighten. Through  the belt of trees beyond the brook shone a strange red light, the trunks  and branches of the trees making a black lacework against it. It struck  the creeping figures and gave them monstrous shadows, which caricatured  their movements on the lit grass. It fell upon their faces, touching  their whiteness with a ruddy tinge, accentuating the stains with which  so many of them were freaked and maculated. It sparkled on buttons and  bits of metal in their clothing. Instinctively the child turned toward  the growing splendor and moved down the slope with his horrible  companions; in a few moments had passed the foremost of the throng--not  much of a feat, considering his advantages. He placed himself in the  lead, his wooden sword still in hand, and solemnly directed the march,  conforming his pace to theirs and occasionally turning as if to see that  his forces did not straggle. Surely such a leader never before had such  a following.    Scattered about upon the ground now slowly narrowing by the encroachment  of this awful march to water, were certain articles to which, in the  leader's mind, were coupled no significant associations: an occasional  blanket, tightly rolled lengthwise, doubled and the ends bound together  with a string; a heavy knapsack here, and there a broken rifle--such  things, in short, as are found in the rear of retreating troops, the  \"spoor\" of men flying from their hunters. Everywhere near the creek,  which here had a margin of lowland, the earth was trodden into mud by  the feet of men and horses. An observer of better experience in the use  of his eyes would have noticed that these footprints pointed in both  directions; the ground had been twice passed over--in advance and in  retreat. A few hours before, these desperate, stricken men, with their  more fortunate and now distant comrades, had penetrated the forest in  thousands. Their successive battalions, breaking into swarms and  re-forming in lines, had passed the child on every side--had almost  trodden on him as he slept. The rustle and murmur of their march had not  awakened him. Almost within a stone's throw of where he lay they had  fought a battle; but all unheard by him were the roar of the musketry,  the shock of the cannon, \"the thunder of the captains and the shouting.\"  He had slept through it all, grasping his little wooden sword with  perhaps a tighter clutch in unconscious sympathy with his martial  environment, but as heedless of the grandeur of the struggle as the dead  who had died to make the glory.    The fire beyond the belt of woods on the farther side of the creek,  reflected to earth from the canopy of its own smoke, was now suffusing  the whole landscape. It transformed the sinuous line of mist to the  vapor of gold. The water gleamed with dashes of red, and red, too, were  many of the stones protruding above the surface. But that was blood; the  less desperately wounded had stained them in crossing. On them, too, the  child now crossed with eager steps; he was going to the fire. As he  stood upon the farther bank he turned about to look at the companions of  his march. The advance was arriving at the creek. The stronger had  already drawn themselves to the brink and plunged their faces into the  flood. Three or four who lay without motion appeared to have no heads.  At this the child's eyes expanded with wonder; even his hospitable  understanding could not accept a phenomenon implying such vitality as  that. After slaking their thirst these men had not had the strength to  back away"]]]
