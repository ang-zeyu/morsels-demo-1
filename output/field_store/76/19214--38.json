It was by their developed thought-force that they drew the whole world  to themselves. The positive thinker generates a force that draws all such  as are _negative_ to him. Nearly the whole world was negative to these  Masters and hence felt attracted to them. _These were the human  touchstones_.    3. It was by their strong, manly, marvellous Will-Power that they  drove their suggestions into other minds and gained an immediate  ascendency over whatever environments they were placed in. The whole  man is summed up in his Will. Every other power in man is subservient  to the Will. And say what you will, it is this power more than any other  that we respect in others. It is the central staff in our character.  Intelligence is the directive energy. Will-Power is the propulsive  energy. And the latter when wielded under the guidance of the former  makes of man a veritable God.    4. It was by their unusual power of _Self-control_ that they could stand  square upon their feet and could remain unshaken by the waves of  conflicting opinions and the hostile attacks that continually dashed up  against them. _Master yourself_, i.e., your personal, relative and lower  self, and beyond the shadow of a doubt, _the mastery of others is already  yours._ But the world will teach you bitter lessons and rend you to  pieces if you try consciously to control it while you are still a slave  to your lower self. Be great. Strive for Perfection. So will you be  recognised by others. And according to the transcendent energy of the  highest law of our Being it is the consciousness of heights scaled,  accomplishments achieved and consequent dawning of a Loftier Ideal upon  our intellectual horizon that fills us with Strength and Peace rather  than the recognition of our worth by others. It is a serious mistake to  care for fame, praise and admiration. You get them only when you do not  care for them in the least, when your soul has outgrown all such clinging  to the relative in the light of _eternal thought_, when you have risen to  the Absolute and learnt to read the meaning of the \"LARGER WORLD\" of  life. Do not pass by this lightly. In it is the key to Peace, Power and  Poise. All that is Real and Permanent, is on the plane of the Absolute.    Now we are drawing to the practical side of our Lesson. The four  principal points, you will please remember, are: (1) Intelligence. (2)  Thought-Force. (3) Will-Power. (4) Self-Control. You might feel  surprised at my retailing this \"ancient history\" instead of teaching you  how to approach a man, make him your slave and command him to fall  down at your feet and do your bidding. Perhaps you expected me to  tell you how to sail through the air, pass through solid walls,  materialize and dematerialize at will and like Appolonius of Tyana vanish  in the flash of an eye from the court of Ionysius and appear elsewhere at  a distance of 19,000 miles at the same moment. No, no. I will take it  for granted that you are made of different stuff and _an earnest seeker  after the truth_. If you strive to build yourself on the basis of the  simple principles as laid down in this series of lessons you will in time  grow into the Higher Self and at last become one with it. Moreover, your  daily life will be the Occasion for the practical application of these  principles, thus enabling you to pursue your way through life calmly,  earnestly, independently and with the quiet dignity of a man \"who knows  what he is about\". I cannot and would not speak of \"get-rich-quick\"  methods of self-development because they are the veriest rot imaginable.    Now then: (1) Intelligence and (2) Thought-Force are the natural  results of an organised brain.    Concentration is the key to such development. Concentration has been  fully explained in Lesson No. 1. By the constant exercise of  concentration, objectively and subjectively, in your daily life you  will in a short time become conscious of growing Strength. The  exercises I give you in this lesson on Self-Control, Will-Culture and  Memory-Culture if gone through with perseverance will further develop  Concentrative ability. In fact, this entire series of lessons will call  for Effort and Concentration. \"Rome was not built in a day\"--nor can you  achieve real greatness in a few months. No. All I can do is to indicate  the line and the nature of the effort required of you and if clearly  followed, Progress and Growth will commence from the first day. In  connection with this, a little digression would be necessary. The  Occultist says: Nature, unaided, fails. The purposiveness of Deity,  manifesting in nature an evolution, is present in all individual centres  but it has the way to full expression opened out to itself only when the  more evolved centres of life consciously cooperate with it. Evolution is  started and carried only by the creation of centres within the GREAT  CONSCIOUSNESS and by preserving and enlarging or expanding these centres.  So long as the race had not reached \"SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS\" (see Yoga  Lessons) the sub-conscious forces of nature had entire control over  evolutionary processes, but this stage was reached by the race according  to the LAW OF AVERAGES in the seventeenth century and you are now  expected to take your progress in your hands and consciously direct your  inner forces along such lines as best correspond to the stage of your  growth. So independent study and steady thinking form the secrets of a  keen and broad intelligence. You will always find that the man who is  more powerful than yourself and moves you at his will has an intelligence  and understanding far superior to yours and he can read your whole nature  as he would an open book, although you find him quite beyond your  depth. Learn to regard earnestly the workings of different mentalities  around you. Become a student of human nature. To you, each man  ought to be only a partial expression of his mind. Examine closely into  the motives acting behind each personality. Learn to respond more  quickly to the _Thoughts_ and _Feelings_ of a man than to his outer  speech and action. The latter are objective expressions of the subjective  self. The study of Phrenology and Physiognomy are good things to start  with in your efforts to acquire knowledge of human nature. _Mind is One_  and at the same time, _Many_. Subjectively, it is ONE. Objectively; many.  So by looking _impartially_ into \"yourself\" in the calm light of the  intellect and through silent introspection, you will always find a clue  to the working bases of other minds. Each man is a puzzle and most of all  are _YOU_ a puzzle unto yourself. Solve either and you have solved both.  \"MAN, KNOW THYSELF.\"      THE MYSTERY OF THE WILL-FORCE.    Will-Force is the power of Re-action. It can render all the other  mental functions _active_ or _passive_. It is the DETERMINATIVE faculty  and is affected most of all by the JUDGMENT. On the lower plane  of mind, Will-Power manifests as Desire and is reciprocally influenced  by outside attractions as well as repulsions. On this plane the Will is  not free. But when it draws the volition for externalizing itself from  _Within_ in the light of the Higher Reason, then indeed is it  _Will-Power. On the material the human will is a slave; on the spiritual  plane it is the sovereign. It may then be called the \"awakened\" will_. It  is my conviction that the eternal crossing of swords between the  Determinists and the Libertarians can be set at rest only by a right  understanding of the _spiritual_ makeup of man, otherwise the arguments  of both sets of thinkers are equally strong. Each side has got hold of  half the truth, but requires the reconciling light of transcendental  Psychology in order to enable us to see the _whole_ truth as it is.  However, the point I am driving at is that your will is free only when it  is _self-determined_ i.e., when it has risen above the impulses of the  Lower Personal Self and acts under the direction of the Higher Impersonal  Self_. In order to fix this most important truth in your mind, let us  give you a brief idea of the \"I AM\" consciousness. Do not pass this by as  so much dry rot. No one will ever or can ever manifest genuine Will-Force  of a distinctly spiritual type who does not understand the \"I AM\"  consciousness. So please listen attentively and think over the following.      THE \"I AM\" CONSCIOUSNESS.    If you just turn in and examine the report of your consciousness  regarding the _self_-dwelling within, you will become conscious of the  \"I\". But if you press your examination a little closer you will find that  this \"I\" may be split up into two distinct aspects which, while working  in unison and conjunction, may nevertheless be set apart in thought.  There is an \"I\" function and there is a \"me\" function and these mental  twins develop distinct phenomena. The first is the \"MASCULINE\" principle;  the second is the \"FEMININE\" principle. Other terms used in current  writings on New Psychology are Conscious Mind, Active Mind, Voluntary  Mind, Objective Mind and so forth. These all refer to the \"I\" principle.  And the \"me\" form of mind corresponds to the Sub-Conscious Mind, Passive  Mind, Involuntary Mind, Subjective Mind and so on. Ninety-nine p. c. of  humanity mean this \"me\" when they say \"I\". Now let us examine what this  \"me\" implies. It consists largely of our consciousness, of our body and  physical sensations as associated with touch, taste, smell, sight and  hearing. The consciousness of some of us is largely bound up in the  physical and carnal side of life. We \"live there.\" There are some men who  consider their \"clothes\" too as being a part of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13325"],[0,"Sketches of the Natural History of Ceylon (#5)"],[1," and long  hair on the top of their heads, which parteth and hangeth down like a  man's, and which do a deal of mischief to the corn, and are so impudent  that they will come into their gardens and eat such fruit as grows  there. And the Wanderoos, some as large as our English spaniel dogs, of  a darkish grey colour, and black faces with great white beards round  from ear to ear, which makes them show just like old men. This sort does  but little mischief, keeping in the woods, eating only leaves and buds  of trees, but when they are catched they will eat anything.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: KNOX, _Historical Relation of Ceylon, an Island in the  East Indies_.--P. i. ch. vi. p. 25. Fol. Lond. 1681. See an account  of his captivity in SIR J. EMERSON TENNENT'S _Ceylon_, etc., Vol.  II. p. 66 n.]    KNOX, whose experience during his long captivity was confined almost  exclusively to the hill country around Kandy, spoke in all probability  of one large and comparatively powerful species, _Presbytes ursinus_,  which inhabits the lofty forests, and which, as well as another of the  same group, _P. Thersites_, was, till recently, unknown to European  naturalists. The Singhalese word _Ouandura_ has a generic sense, and  being in every respect the equivalent fur our own term of \"monkey\" it  necessarily comprehends the low country species, as well as those which  inhabit other parts of the island. In point of fact, there are no less  than four animals in the island, each of which is entitled to the name  of \"wanderoo.\"[1] Each separate species has appropriated to itself a  different district of the wooded country, and seldom encroaches on the  domain of its neighbours.    [Footnote 1: Down to a very late period, a large and somewhat  repulsive-looking monkey, common to the Malabar coast, the Silenus  veter, _Linn._, was, from the circumstance of his possessing a  \"great white beard,\" incorrectly assumed to be the \"wanderoo\" of  Ceylon, described by KNOX; and under that usurped name it has figured  in every author from Buffon to the present time. Specimens of the true  Singhalese species were, however, received in Europe; but in the  absence of information in this country as to their actual habitat,  they were described, first by Zimmerman, on the continent, under the  name of, _Leucoprymnus cephalopterus_, and subsequently by Mr. E.  Bennett, under that of _Semnopithecus Nestor_ (_Proc. Zool.  Soc._ pt. i. p. 67: 1833); the generic and specific characters  being on this occasion most carefully pointed out by that eminent  naturalist. Eleven years later Dr. Templeton forwarded to the  Zoological Society a description, accompanied by drawings, of the  wanderoo of the western maritime districts of Ceylon, and noticed the  fact that the wanderoo of authors (_S. veter_) was not to be  found in the island except as an introduced species in the custody of  the Arab horse-dealers, who visit the port of Colombo at stated  periods. Mr. Waterhouse, at the meeting (_Proc. Zool. Soc._ p. 1:  1844) at which this communication was read, recognised the identity of  the subject of Dr. Templeton's description with that already laid  before them by Mr. Bennett; and from this period the species in  question was believed to truly represent the wanderoo of Knox. The  later discovery, however, of the _P. ursinus_ by Dr. Kelaart, in  the mountains amongst which we are assured that Knox spent so many  years of captivity, reopens the question, but at the same time appears  to me clearly to demonstrate that in this latter we have in reality  the animal to which his narrative refers.]    1. Of the four species found in Ceylon, the most numerous in the  island, and the one best known in Europe, is the Wanderoo of the low  country, the _P. cephalopterus_ of Zimmerman.[1] Although common  in the southern and western provinces, it is never found at a higher  elevation than 1300 feet. It is an active and intelligent creature,  little larger than the common bonneted Macaque, and far from being so  mischievous as others of the monkeys in the island. In captivity it is  remarkable for the gravity of its demeanour and for an air of  melancholy in its expression and movements which are completely in  character with its snowy beard and venerable aspect. In disposition it  is gentle and confiding, sensible in the highest degree of kindness,  and eager for endearing attention, uttering a low plaintive cry when  its sympathies are excited. It is particularly cleanly in its habits  when domesticated, and spends much of its time in trimming its fur,  and carefully divesting its hair of particles of dust.    [Footnote 1: Leucoprymnus Nestor, _Bennett_.]    Those which I kept at my house near Colombo were chiefly fed upon  plantains and bananas, but for nothing did they evince a greater  partiality than the rose-coloured flowers of the red hibiscus (H.  _rosa-sinensis_).    These they devoured with unequivocal gusto; they likewise relished the  leaves of many other trees, and even the bark of a few of the more  succulent ones. A hint might possibly be taken from this circumstance  for improving the regimen of monkeys in menageries, by the occasional  admixture of a few fresh leaves and flowers with their solid and  substantial dietary.    A white monkey, taken between Ambepusse and Kornegalle, where they are  said to be numerous, was brought to me to Colombo. Except in colour,  it had all the characteristics of _Presbytes cephalopterus_. So  striking was its whiteness that it might have been conjectured to be  an albino, but for the circumstance that its eyes and face were black.  I have heard that white monkeys have been seen near the Ridi-galle  Wihara in Seven Korles and also at Tangalle; but I never saw another  specimen. The natives say they are not uncommon, and KNOX that they  are \"milk-white both in body and face; but of this sort there is not  such plenty.\"[1] The Rev. R. SPENCE HARDY mentions, in his learned  work on _Eastern Monachism_, that on the occasion of his visit to  the great temple of Dambool, he encountered a troop of white monkeys  on the rock in which it is situated--which were, doubtless, a variety  of the Wanderoo.[2] PLINY was aware of the fact that white monkeys are  occasionally found in India.[3]    [Footnote 1: KNOX, pt. i.e. vi. p. 25.]    [Footnote 2: _Eastern Monachism_. c: xix; p. 204.]    [Footnote 3: PLINY, Nat. Hist. I. viii. c. xxxii.]    When observed in their native wilds, a party of twenty or thirty of  these creatures is generally busily engaged in the search for berries  and buds. They are seldom to be seen on the ground, except when  they may have descended to recover seeds or fruit which have fallen at  the foot of their favourite trees. When disturbed, their leaps are  prodigious: but, generally speaking, their progress is made not so  much by _leaping_ as by swinging from branch to branch, using  their powerful arms alternately; and when baffled by distance,  flinging themselves obliquely so as to catch the lower boughs of an  opposite tree, the momentum acquired by their descent being sufficient  to cause a rebound of the branch, that carries them upwards again,  till they can grasp a higher and more distant one, and thus continue  their headlong flight. In these perilous achievements, wonder is  excited less by the surpassing agility of these little creatures,  frequently encumbered as they are by their young, which cling to them  in their career, than by the quickness of their eye and the unerring  accuracy with which they seem almost to calculate the angle at which a  descent will enable them to cover a given distance, and the recoil to  attain a higher altitude.    2. The low country Wanderoo is replaced in the hills by the larger  species, _P. ursinus_, which inhabits the mountain zone. The natives,  who designate the latter the _Maha_ or Great Wanderoo, to distinguish it  from the _Kaloo_, or black one, with which they are familiar, describe  it as much wilder, and more powerful than its congener of the lowland  forests. It is rarely seen by Europeans, this portion of the country  having till very recently been but partially opened; and even now it is  difficult to observe its habits, as it seldom approaches the few roads  which wind through these deep solitudes. At early morning, ere the day  begins to dawn, its loud and peculiar howl, which consists of a quick  repetition of the sounds _how how!_ maybe frequently heard in the  mountain jungles, and forms one of the characteristic noises of these  lofty situations. It was first captured by Dr. Kelaart in the woods near  Nuera-ellia, and from its peculiar appearance it has been named _P.  ursinus_ by Mr. Blyth.[1]    [Footnote 1: Mr. Blyth quotes as authority for this trivial name a  passage from MAJOR FORBES' _Eleven Years in Ceylon;_ and I can  vouch for the graphic accuracy of the remark.--\"A species of very  large monkey, that passed some distance before me, when resting on all  fours, looked so like a Ceylon bear, that I nearly took him for one.\"]    3. The _P. Thersites_, which is chiefly distinguished from the  others by wanting the head tuft, is so rare that it was for some time  doubtful whether the single specimen procured by Dr. Templeton from  the Nuera-kalawa, west of Trincomalie, and on which Mr. Blyth  conferred this new name, was in reality native; but the occurrence of  a second, since identified by Dr. Kelaart, has established its  existence as a separate species. Like the common wanderoo, the one  obtained by Dr. Templeton was partial to fresh vegetables, plantains,  and fruit; but he ate freely boiled rice, beans, and gram. He was fond  of being noticed and petted, stretching out his limbs in succession to  be scratched, drawing himself up so that his ribs might be reached by  the finger, closing his eyes during the operation, and evincing his  satisfaction by grimaces irresistibly ludicrous.    4.
