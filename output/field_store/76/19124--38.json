I regret, sir, that I approached you for information, since you have  misjudged my motive. But far from my interest having ceased, it has now  as I see the matter become a sacred duty to learn what it was that Sir  Charles apprehended. This duty, Doctor McMurdoch, I propose to fulfil  with or without your assistance.\"    \"Oh,\" said Doctor McMurdoch, gloomily, \"I'm afraid I've offended you.  But I meant well, Mr. Harley.\" A faint trace of human emotion showed  itself in his deep voice. \"Charley Abingdon and I were students together  in Edinburgh,\" he explained. \"I was mayhap a little strange.\"    His apology was so evidently sincere that Harley relented at once.  \"Please say no more, Doctor McMurdoch,\" he responded. \"I fully  appreciate your feelings in the matter. At such a time a stranger  can only be an intruder; but\"--he fixed his keen eyes upon the  physician--\"there is more underlying all this than you suspect or could  readily believe. You will live to know that I have spoken the truth.\"    \"I know it now,\" declared the Scotsman, solemnly. \"Abingdon was always  eccentric, but he didn't know the meaning of fear.\"    \"Once that may have been true,\" replied Harley. \"But a great fear was  upon him when he came to me, Doctor McMurdoch, and if it is humanly  possible I am going to discover its cause.\"    \"Go ahead,\" said Doctor McMurdoch and, turning to the side table, he  poured out two liberal portions of whiskey. \"If there's anything I can  do to help, count me at your service. You tell me he had fears about  little Phil?\"    \"He had,\" answered Harley, \"and it is maddening to think that he died  before he could acquaint me with their nature. But I have hopes that  you can help me in this. For instance\"--again he fixed his gaze upon  the gloomy face of the physician--\"who is the distinguished Oriental  gentleman with whom Sir Charles had recently become acquainted?\"    Doctor McMurdoch's expression remained utterly blank, and he slowly  shook his head. \"I haven't an idea in the world,\" he declared. \"A  patient, perhaps?\"    \"Possibly,\" said Harley, conscious of some disappointment; \"yet from the  way he spoke of him I scarcely think that he was a patient. Surely Sir  Charles, having resided so long in India, numbered several Orientals  among his acquaintances if not among his friends?\"    \"None ever came to his home,\" replied Doctor McMurdoch. \"He had all the  Anglo-Indian's prejudice against men of colour.\" He rested his massive  chin in his hand and stared down reflectively at the carpet.    \"Then you have no suggestion to offer in regard to this person?\"    \"None. Did he tell you nothing further about him?\"    \"Unfortunately, nothing. In the next place, Doctor McMurdoch, are you  aware of any difference of opinion which had arisen latterly between Sir  Charles and his daughter?\"    \"Difference of opinion!\" replied Doctor McMurdoch, raising his brows  ironically. \"There would always be difference of opinion between little  Phil and any man who cared for her. But out-and-out quarrel--no!\"    Again Harley found himself at a deadlock, and it was with scanty hope  of success that he put his third question to the gloomy Scot. \"Was Sir  Charles a friend of Mr. Nicol Brinn?\" he asked.    \"Nicol Brinn?\" echoed the physician. He looked perplexed. \"You mean the  American millionaire? I believe they were acquainted. Abingdon knew most  of the extraordinary people in London; and if half one hears is true  Nicol Brinn is as mad as a hatter. But they were not in any sense  friends as far as I know.\" He was watching Harley curiously. \"Why do you  ask that question?\"    \"I will tell you in a moment,\" said Harley, rapidly, \"but I have one  more question to put to you first. Does the term Fire-Tongue convey  anything to your mind?\"    Doctor McMurdoch's eyebrows shot upward most amazingly. \"I won't insult  you by supposing that you have chosen such a time for joking,\" he said,  dourly. \"But if your third question surprised me, I must say that your  fourth sounds simply daft.\"    \"It must,\" agreed Harley, and his manner was almost fierce; \"but when  I tell you why I ask these two questions--and I only do so on the  understand ing that my words are to be treated in the strictest  confidence--you may regard the matter in a new light. 'Nicol Brinn' and  'Fire-Tongue' were the last words which Sir Charles Abingdon uttered.\"    \"What!\" cried Doctor McMurdoch, displaying a sudden surprising energy.  \"What?\"    \"I solemnly assure you,\" declared Harley, \"that such is the case.  Benson, the butler, also overheard them.\"    Doctor McMurdoch relapsed once more into gloom, gazing at the whiskey in  the glass which he held in his hand and slowly shaking his head. \"Poor  old Charley Abingdon,\" he murmured. \"It's plain to me, Mr. Harley, that  his mind was wandering. May not we find here an explanation, too, of  this idea of his that some danger overhung Phil? You didn't chance to  notice, I suppose, whether he had a temperature?\"    \"I did not,\" replied Harley, smiling slightly. But the smile quickly  left his face, which became again grim and stern.    A short silence ensued, during which Doctor McMurdoch sat staring  moodily down at the carpet and Harley slowly paced up and down the room;  then:    \"In view of the fact,\" he said, suddenly, \"that Sir Charles clearly  apprehended an attempt upon his life, are you satisfied professionally  that death was due to natural causes?\"    \"Perfectly satisfied,\" replied the physician, looking up with a start:  \"perfectly satisfied. It was unexpected, of course, but such cases are  by no means unusual. He was formerly a keen athlete, remember. 'Tis  often so. Surely you don't suspect foul play? I understood you to mean  that his apprehensions were on behalf of Phil.\"    Paul Harley stood still, staring meditatively in the other's direction.  \"There is not a scrap of evidence to support such a theory,\" he  admitted, \"but if you knew of the existence of any poisonous agent which  would produce effects simulating these familiar symptoms, I should be  tempted to take certain steps.\"    \"If you are talking about poisons,\" said the physician, a rather  startled look appearing upon his face, \"there are several I might  mention; but the idea seems preposterous to me. Why should any one want  to harm Charley Abingdon? When could poison have been administered and  by whom?\"    \"When, indeed?\" murmured Harley. \"Yet I am not satisfied.\"    \"You're not hinting at--suicide?\"    \"Emphatically no.\"    \"What had he eaten?\"    \"Nothing but soup, except that he drank a portion of a glass of water. I  am wondering if he took anything at Mr. Wilson's house.\" He stared hard  at Doctor McMurdoch. \"It may surprise you to learn that I have already  taken steps to have the remains of the soup from Sir Charles's plate  examined, as well as the water in the glass. I now propose to call upon  Mr. Wilson in order that I may complete this line of enquiry.\"    \"I sympathize with your suspicions, Mr. Harley,\" said the physician  dourly, \"but you are wasting your time.\" A touch of the old acidity  crept back into his manner. \"My certificate will be 'syncope due to  unusual excitement'; and I shall stand by it.\"    \"You are quite entitled to your own opinion,\" Harley conceded, \"which if  I were in your place would be my own. But what do you make of the fact  that Sir Charles received a bogus telephone message some ten minutes  before my arrival, as a result of which he visited Mr. Wilson's house?\"    \"But he's attending Wilson,\" protested the physician.    \"Nevertheless, no one there had telephoned. It was a ruse. I don't  assume for a moment that this ruse was purposeless.\"    Doctor McMurdoch was now staring hard at the speaker.    \"You may also know,\" Harley continued, \"that there was an attempted  burglary here less than a week ago.\"    \"I know that,\" admitted the other, \"but it counts for little. There have  been several burglaries in the neighbourhood of late.\"    Harley perceived that Doctor McMurdoch was one of those characters, not  uncommon north of the Tweed, who, if slow in forming an opinion, once  having done so cling to it as tightly as any barnacle.    \"You may be right and I may be wrong,\" Harley admitted, \"but while your  professional business with Sir Charles unfortunately is ended, mine is  only beginning. May I count upon you to advise me of Miss Abingdon's  return? I particularly wish to see her, and I should prefer to meet  her in the capacity of a friend rather than in that of a professional  investigator.\"    \"At the earliest moment that I can decently arrange a meeting,\" replied  Doctor McMurdoch, \"I will communicate with you, Mr. Harley. I am just  cudgelling my brains at the moment to think how the news is to be broken  to her. Poor little Phil! He was all she had.\"    \"I wish I could help you,\" declared Harley with sincerity, \"but in the  circumstances any suggestion of mine would be mere impertinence.\" He  held out his hand to the doctor.    \"Good-night,\" said the latter, gripping it heartily. \"If there is any  mystery surrounding poor Abingdon's death, I believe you are the man to  clear it up. But, frankly, it was his heart. I believe he had a touch of  the sun once in India. Who knows? His idea that some danger threatened  him or threatened Phil may have been merely--\" He tapped his brow  significantly.    \"But in the whole of your knowledge of Sir Charles,\" cried Harley,  exhibiting a certain irritation, \"have you ever known him to suffer from  delusions of that kind or any other?\"    \"Never,\" replied the physician, firmly; \"but once a man has had the sun  one cannot tell.\"    \"Ah!\" said Harley. \"Good-night, Doctor McMurdoch.\"    When presently he left the house, carrying a brown leather bag which he  had borrowed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11602"],[0,"The World of Ice (#5)"],[1,"nt.    \"Once more, dear aunt,\" said he, \"farewell. With God's blessing we shall  come back soon.--Write to me, darling Isobel, won't you? to Upernavik,  on the coast of Greenland. If none of our ships are bound in that  direction, write by way of Denmark. Old Mr. Singleton will tell you how  to address your letter; and see that it be a long one.\"    \"Now then, youngster, jump aboard,\" shouted the captain; \"look sharp!\"    \"Ay, ay,\" returned Fred, and in another moment he was on the  quarter-deck, by the side of his friend Tom.    The ship, loosed from her moorings, spread her canvas, and plunged  forward on her adventurous voyage.    But this time she does not grow smaller as she advances before the  freshening breeze, for you and I, reader, have embarked in her, and the  land now fades in the distance, until it sinks from view on the distant  horizon, while nothing meets our gaze but the vault of the bright blue  sky above, and the plane of the dark blue sea below.        CHAPTER III.    _The voyage--The \"Dolphin\" and her crew--Ice ahead--Polar  scenes--Masthead observations--The first whale--Great excitement_.      And now we have fairly got into blue water--the sailor's delight, the  landsman's dread,--      \"The sea! the sea! the open sea;    The blue, the fresh, the ever free.\"    \"It's my opinion,\" remarked Buzzby to Singleton one day, as they stood  at the weather gangway watching the foam that spread from the vessel's  bow as she breasted the waves of the Atlantic gallantly--it's my opinion  that our skipper is made o' the right stuff. He's entered quite into the  spirit of the thing, and I heard him say to the first mate yesterday  he'd made up his mind to run right up into Baffin's Bay and make  inquiries for Captain Ellice first, before goin' to his usual  whalin'-ground. Now that's wot I call doin' the right thing; for, ye  see, he runs no small risk o' getting beset in the ice, and losing the  fishin' altogether by so doin'.\"    \"He's a fine fellow,\" said Singleton; \"I like him better every day, and  I feel convinced he will do his utmost to discover the whereabouts of  our missing friend; but I fear much that our chances are small, for,  although we know the spot which Captain Ellice intended to visit, we  cannot tell to what part of the frozen ocean ice and currents may have  carried him.\"    \"True,\" replied Buzzby, giving to his left eye and cheek just that  peculiar amount of screw which indicated intense sagacity and  penetration; \"but I've a notion that, if they are to be found, Captain  Guy is the man to find 'em.\"    \"I hope it may turn out as you say. Have you ever been in these seas  before, Buzzby?\"    \"No, sir--never; but I've got a half-brother wot has bin in the  Greenland whale-fishery, and I've bin in the South Sea line myself.\"    \"What line was that, Buzzby?\" inquired David Summers, a sturdy boy of  about fifteen, who acted as assistant steward, and was, in fact, a  nautical maid-of-all-work. \"Was it a log-line, or a bow-line, or a  cod-line, or a bit of the equator, eh?\"    The old salt deigned no reply to this passing sally, but continued his  converse with Singleton.    \"I could give ye many a long yarn about the South Seas,\" said Buzzby,  gazing abstractedly down into the deep. \"One time when I was about fifty  miles to the sou'-west o' Cape Horn, I--\"    \"Dinner's ready, sir,\" said a thin, tall, active man, stepping smartly  up to Singleton, and touching his cap.    \"We must talk over that some other time, Buzzby. The captain loves  punctuality.\" So saying, the young surgeon sprang down the companion  ladder, leaving the old salt to smoke his pipe in solitude.    And here we may pause a few seconds to describe our ship and her crew.    The _Dolphin_ was a tight, new, barque-rigged vessel of about three  hundred tons burden, built expressly for the northern whale-fishery, and  carried a crew of forty-five men. Ships that have to battle with the ice  require to be much more powerfully built than those that sail in  unencumbered seas. The _Dolphin_ united strength with capacity and  buoyancy. The under part of her hull and sides were strengthened with  double timbers, and fortified externally with plates of iron, while,  internally, stanchions and crossbeams were so arranged as to cause  pressure on any part to be supported by the whole structure; and on her  bows, where shocks from the ice might be expected to be most frequent  and severe, extra planking, of immense strength and thickness, was  secured. In other respects, the vessel was fitted up much in the same  manner as ordinary merchantmen. The only other peculiarity about her  worthy of notice was the crow's-nest, a sort of barrel-shaped structure  fastened to the fore-mast-head, in which, when at the whaling-ground, a  man is stationed to look out for whales. The chief men in the ship were  Captain Guy, a vigorous, earnest, practical American; Mr. Bolton, the  first mate, a stout, burly, off-hand Englishman; and Mr. Saunders, the  second mate, a sedate, broad-shouldered, raw-boned Scot, whose opinion  of himself was unbounded, whose power of argument was extraordinary, not  to say exasperating, and who stood six feet three in his stockings.  Mivins, the steward, was, as we have already remarked, a tall, thin,  active young man, of a brisk, lively disposition, and was somewhat of a  butt among the men, but being in a position of power and trust, he was  respected. The young surgeon, Tom Singleton, whom we have yet scarcely  introduced to the reader, was a tall, slim, but firmly-knit youth, with  a kind, gentle disposition. He was always open, straightforward, and  polite. He never indulged in broad humour, though he enjoyed it much,  seldom ventured on a witticism, was rather shy in the company of his  companions, and spoke little; but for a quiet, pleasant _tete-a-tete_  there was not a man in the ship equal to Tom Singleton. His countenance  was Spanish-looking and handsome, his hair black, short, and curling,  and his budding moustache was soft and dark as the eyebrow of an  Andalusian belle.    It would be unpardonable, in this catalogue, to omit the cook, David  Mizzle. He was round, and fat, and oily, as one of his own \"duff\"  puddings. To look at him you could not help suspecting that he purloined  and ate at least half of the salt pork he cooked, and his sly, dimpling  laugh, in which every feature participated, from the point of his broad  chin to the top of his bald head, rather tended to favour this  supposition. Mizzle was prematurely bald--being quite a young man--and  when questioned on the subject, he usually attributed it to the fact of  his having been so long employed about the cooking coppers, that the  excessive heat to which he was exposed had stewed all the hair off his  head! The crew was made up of stout, active men in the prime of life,  nearly all of whom had been more or less accustomed to the  whale-fishing, and some of the harpooners were giants in muscular  development and breadth of shoulder, if not in height.    Chief among these harpooners was Amos Parr, a short, thick-set, powerful  man of about thirty-five, who had been at sea since he was a little boy,  and had served in the fisheries of both the Northern and Southern Seas.  No one knew what country had the honour of producing him--indeed, he was  ignorant of that point himself; for, although he had vivid recollections  of his childhood having been spent among green hills, and trees, and  streamlets, he was sent to sea with a strange captain before he was old  enough to care about the name of his native land. Afterwards he ran away  from his ship, and so lost all chance of ever discovering who he was;  but, as he sometimes remarked, he didn't much care who he was, so long  as he was _himself_; so it didn't matter. From a slight peculiarity in  his accent, and other qualities, it was surmised that he must be an  Irishman--a supposition which he rather encouraged, being partial to the  sons, and particularly partial to the daughters, of the Emerald Isle,  one of which last he had married just six months before setting out on  this whaling expedition.    Such were the _Dolphin_ and her crew, and merrily they bowled along  over the broad Atlantic with favouring winds, and without meeting with  anything worthy of note until they neared the coast of Greenland.    One fine morning, just as the party in the cabin had finished breakfast,  and were dallying with the last few morsels of the repast, as men who  have more leisure than they desire are wont to do, there was a sudden  shock felt, and a slight tremor passed through the ship as if something  had struck her.    \"Ha!\" exclaimed Captain Guy, finishing his cup of chocolate, \"there goes  the first bump.\"    \"Ice ahead, sir,\" said the first mate, looking down the skylight.    \"Is there much?\" asked the captain, rising and taking down a small  telescope from the hook on which it usually hung.    \"Not much, sir--only a stream; but there is an ice-blink right ahead all  along the horizon.\"    \"How's her head, Mr. Bolton?\"    \"Nor'-west and by north, sir.\"    Before this brief conversation came to a close, Fred Ellice and Tom  Singleton sprang up the companion ladder, and stood on the deck gazing  ahead with feelings of the deepest interest. Both youths were well read  in the history of Polar Seas and Regions; they were well acquainted, by  name at least, with floes, and bergs, and hummocks of ice, but neither  of them had seen such in reality. These objects were associated in their  young minds with all that was romantic and wild, hyperborean and polar,  brilliant and sparkling, and light and white--emphatically _white_. To  behold ice actually floating on the salt sea was an incident of note in  their existence; and certainly the impressions of their first day in the  ice remained sharp, vivid, and prominent, long after scenes of a much  more striking nature had faded from the tablets of"]]]
