[Illustration: KENT'S TORSION BALANCE. Fig 2.]    In spite of all the foregoing facts, it was reserved for the  \"Encyclopedia Britannica,\" in its ninth edition, to use the following as  the result of its condensed wisdom:    \"In the torsion balance proper, the wire is stretched out horizontally,  and supports a beam so fixed that the wire passes through the center of  gravity. Hence the elasticity of the wire plays the same part as the  weight of the beam does in the common balance. An instrument of this  sort was invented by Ritchie, for the measurement of very small weights,  and for this purpose it may offer certain advantages; but clearly if it  were ever to be used for measuring larger weights, the beam would have  to be supported by knife edges and bearing, and in regard to such  applications therefore (as in serious gravimetric work), it has no  _raison d'etre.\"_    [Illustration: KENT'S TORSION BALANCE. Fig 3.]    This would seem to settle the whole case, for if the encyclopedia says  it has no reason to be, then, like the edict of the Mikado, it is as  good as dead, and if that is the case, \"Why not say so?\" On the  contrary, the torsion balance seems very much alive. But as it is not  very generally known, perhaps the early history of this form of balance,  briefly sketched, may prove of interest.    One of the first forms of the torsion balance which met the disapproval  of the \"Encyclopedia Britannica\" was attended with the difficulty that  the pivoted wires were attached directly to the bifurcated ends of the  beam, and could not be tensioned without bending these ends unless the  beam was made so heavy as to interfere with its employment in delicate  weighing.    [Illustration: KENT'S TORSION BALANCE. Fig 4.]    The next step was the substitution of light forms stiffened by the wires  being tensioned over them. This was the invention of Professor Roeder,  recently deceased. The next step was the common counter scale, and then  that form of letter scale in which one of the bands acts as a fulcrum  and the other as a pivot.    After Professor Roeder's death, Dr. Alfred Springer, of Cincinnati,  continued perfecting this invention, and with marked success--scales not  intended for anything but the weighing of the ordinary articles of a  grocery store working so accurately that up to 50 lb. two grains would  turn the balance.    As will be noted, this balance dispenses entirely with knife edges, and  this statement carries with it the gist of its entire merit. There is no  friction, and the elegance of the work and the nice adjustments of the  parts struck the writer at once.    [Illustration: KENT'S TORSION BALANCE. Fig 5.]    The prescription scale and the proportional scale (see Fig. 4) are  particularly interesting. The former is sensitive to 1/64 of a grain,  and the latter, invented by Mr. Kent, is a most ingenious method for  weighing, by which, in a small compass (101/2 in. by 41/4 in. by 33/4 in.), we  have a balance capable of weighing 3 lb. avoirdupois by thirty-seconds  of an ounce.    For ordinary balances on the torsion system, in which extreme  sensitiveness is not needed, the trouble caused by change of level of  the scale is insignificant; but it becomes a matter of importance in  more sensitive scales, such as fine analytical balances in places where  it is impossible to keep the table or support of the scale level, for  instance on shipboard.    To counteract this effect of the change of level, Dr. Alfred Springer  devised the system which is shown in its most elementary form in Fig. 2.  An additional beam, E, with wire, F, and poise, H, on support, C, were  added to the balance, and connected to it by a jointed connecting piece,  J. The moment of the structure, E C H, about its center of rotation was  made equal to the moment of A C D about the center. The wires, B and F,  are attached at their ends to supports which are both rigidly connected  to the same base or foundation. If this base, the normal position of  which is horizontal, is tipped slightly, the weights, C and H, will both  tend to fall in the same direction. But suppose the right hand end of  the base is raised, causing both of the weights to tip to the left of  the vertical, D, tending to fall over, the left tends to raise the right  hand end of the beam, and the connecting piece, J H, also tending to  fall to the left, tends to lower the left hand end of E and the piece,  J. The moments of the structure, E C H, and A B D being equal, and one  tending to raise J and the other to lower it, the effect will be zero,  and J will remain in its normal position.    It is not at all necessary, however, to have the weights and dimensions  of the structure, E C H, equal to those of A B D. All that is necessary  is that the components of the weight of each part of the structure which  act vertically on J shall be equal and opposite. For, if the left end of  the beam, E, is made shorter than the right end of the beam, A, a given  angle of rotation of the beam, A, will cause a greater-angle of rotation  of E, consequently will tip the weight, H, further from the vertical  than the weight, D, is tipped, and in that case the weight, D, must be  made smaller than H, to produce an equal and opposite effect upon J. In  practice it is convenient to make the beam, E, only one-fifth to  one-twentieth as long as A, and to correspondingly reduce the weight, H,  relatively to D. In this case, on account of the angle of rotation of  the beam, E, being greater than the angle of rotation of A, the beam, E,  becomes a multiplier of the indications of the primary beam, A.    Mr. Kent has devised a modification of Dr. Springer's system, which is  shown in Fig. 3. It is applied in those varieties of the torsion balance  in which there are two parallel beams, connected by either four or six  wires. The wire, F, carrying the secondary beam, E, and poise, H,  instead of being carried on an independent support, rigidly attached to  the base, as above described, is attached directly to a moving part of  the balance itself, and preferably to the two beams. In Fig. 3, T T T  are trusses over which are tightly stretched the wires, B B B. A A' are  two beams rigidly clamped to the wires; _t_ is another truss with  stretched wire, F F. The upper wire, F', is attached by means of a  flexible spring and standard, S, to the upper beam, and the lower wire  is attached either directly or through a standard to the lower beam. The  secondary poise, H, is rigidly attached to the truss, _t_. The secondary  beam, E, is also rigidly attached to the truss, and acts as a  multiplying beam. The secondary structure thus completely fills two  functions: First, that of multiplying the angle of rotation and thereby  increasing the apparent sensitiveness of the scale, and, second, that of  overcoming the effect of change of level. The secondary beam may be  dispensed with if a multiplier is not needed, and the secondary truss,  _t_, with its standard and counterpoise, H, used alone to counteract the  effect of change of level. Fig. 5 shows a modification of this extremely  ingenious arrangement.--_Engineering_.           *       *       *       *       *          LINK BELTING.    [Footnote: From a paper read before the \"Technischen Verein\" of New  York, May 28, 1887.]    By CHAS. A. SCHIEREN.      The old saying that \"there is nothing new under the sun\" may well be  applied to leather link belting. It is generally believed that these  belts are of recent invention, but that is an error. They are over  thirty years old.    Mr. C.M. Roullier, of Paris, experimented that long ago with small  leather links one and one-half inches long by three-quarters of an inch  wide. These links had two small holes at equal distances apart, and were  joined with iron bolts, which were riveted at the ends, thus making a  perfectly flat surface, and in that way forming a belt entirely of  leather links.    Mr. Roullier's idea was to economize; he therefore utilized the material  left over from the manufacture of flat belting. He perfected his belt  and came to this country in 1862, when he patented the article here and  tried to introduce it. At first it produced quite a sensation, and many  tests were made, but it was soon found that Roullier's belts were not  suited to running our swift motion machinery, and they were therefore  abandoned as impracticable.    Mr. Roullier then introduced his invention into England, where he met  with some success, as his belt was better suited to English slow motion  machinery.    These belts are now largely used in England, many good improvements have  been made in them, and almost every belt maker in Great Britain  manufactures them.    Mr. Jabez Oldfield, of Glasgow, has the reputation of making the best  and most reliable link belt in Great Britain. He has also the reputation  of being the originator of these belts. This is, however, an error, the  credit of the invention belonging, as we have said, to Mr. Roullier.    Mr. Oldfield, nevertheless, has invented many useful machines for  cutting and assorting the links. He has also introduced improved methods  for putting the links together.    For more than twenty years after Mr. Roullier's visit, nothing was done  with leather link belting in this country.    In 1882, however, Mr. N.W. Hall, of Newark, N.J., patented a link belt,  composed of leather and steel links. His method was to place a steel  link after every third or fourth leather one, in order to strengthen the  belt. In practical use this belt was found to be very defective, because  the leather links soon stretched, and thus all the work had to be done  by the steel links. The whole strain coming thus upon the steel links,  they in course of time cut through the bolts and thus broke the belt to  pieces. So this invention proved "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1152"],[0,"The Story of the Volsungs (Volsunga Saga); with Excerpts from the Poetic Edda (#5)"],[1," Niblungs, which  has in varied shapes entered into the literature of many lands. In  the beginning there is no doubt that the story belonged to the common  ancestral folk of all the Teutonic of Scando-Gothic peoples in the  earliest days of their wanderings. Whether they came from the Hindu  Kush, or originated in Northern Europe, brought it with them from Asia,  or evolved it among the mountains and rivers it has taken for scenery,  none know nor can; but each branch of their descendants has it in one  form or another, and as the Icelanders were the very crown and flower of  the northern folk, so also the story which is the peculiar heritage of  that folk received in their hands its highest expression and most noble  form. The oldest shape in which we have it is in the Eddaic poems, some  of which date from unnumbered generations before the time to which most  of them are usually ascribed, the time of the viking-kingdoms in the  Western Isles. In these poems the only historical name is that of  Attila, the great Hun leader, who filled so large a part of the  imagination of the people whose power he had broken. There is no doubt  that, in the days when the kingdoms of the Scando-Goths reached from the  North Cape to the Caspian, that some earlier great king performed his  part; but, after the striking career of Attila, he became the recognised  type of a powerful foreign potentate. All the other actors are  mythic-heroic. Of the Eddaic songs only fragments now remain, but  ere they perished there arose from them a saga, that now given to the  readers of this. The so-called Anglo-Saxons brought part of the story to  England in \"Beowulf\"; in which also appear some incidents that are again  given in the Icelandic saga of \"Grettir the Strong\". Most widely known  is the form taken by the story in the hands of an unknown medieval  German poet, who, from the broken ballads then surviving wrote the  \"Nibelungenlied\" or more properly \"Nibelungen Not\" (\"The Need of the  Niblungs\"). In this the characters are all renamed, some being more  or less historical actors in mid-European history, as Theodoric of the  East-Goths, for instance. The whole of the earlier part of the story has  disappeared, and though Siegfried (Sigurd) has slain a dragon, there is  nothing to connect it with the fate that follows the treasure; Andvari,  the Volsungs, Fafnir, and Regin are all forgotten; the mythological  features have become faint, and the general air of the whole is that of  medieval romance. The swoard Gram is replaced by Balmung, and the Helm  of Awing by the Tarn-cap--the former with no gain, the latter with great  loss. The curse of Andvari, which in the saga is grimly real, working  itself out with slow, sure steps that no power of god or man can turn  aside, in the medieval poem is but a mere scenic effect, a strain of  mystery and magic, that runs through the changes of the story with  much added picturesqueness, but that has no obvious relation to the  working-out of the plot, or fulfilment of their destiny by the different  characters. Brynhild loses a great deal, and is a poor creature when  compared with herself in the saga; Grimhild and her fateful drink have  gone; Gudrun (Chriemhild) is much more complex, but not more tragic;  one new character, Rudiger, appears as the type of chivalry; but Sigurd  (Siegfred) the central figure, though he has lost by the omission of so  much of his life, is, as before, the embodiment of all the virtues that  were dear to northern hearts. Brave, strong, generous, dignified, and  utterly truthful, he moves amid a tangle of tragic events, overmastered  by a mighty fate, and in life or death is still a hero without stain or  flaw. It is no wonder that he survives to this day in the national songs  of the Faroe Islands and in the folk-ballads of Denmark; that his legend  should have been mingled with northern history through Ragnar Lodbrog,  or southern through Attila and Theodoric; that it should have inspired  William Morris in producing the one great English epic of the century;  (13) and Richard Wagner in the mightiest among his music-dramas. Of the  story as told in the saga there is no need here to speak, for to read  it, as may be done a few pages farther on, is that not better than to  read about it? But it may be urged upon those that are pleased and moved  by the passion and power, the strength and deep truth of it, to find out  more than they now know of the folk among whom it grew, and the land in  which they dwelt. In so doing they will come to see how needful are  a few lessons from the healthy life and speech of those days, to be  applied in the bettering of our own.    H. HALLIDAY SPARLING.

In offering to the reader this translation of the most complete and  dramatic form of the great Epic of the North, we lay no claim to special  critical insight, nor do we care to deal at all with vexed questions,  but are content to abide by existing authorities, doing our utmost to  make our rendering close and accurate, and, if it might be so, at the  same time, not over prosaic: it is to the lover of poetry and nature,  rather than to the student, that we appeal to enjoy and wonder at this  great work, now for the first time, strange to say, translated into  English: this must be our excuse for speaking here, as briefly as may  be, of things that will seem to the student over well known to be worth  mentioning, but which may give some ease to the general reader who comes  across our book.    The prose of the \"Volsunga Saga\" was composed probably some time in the  twelfth century, from floating traditions no doubt; from songs which,  now lost, were then known, at least in fragments, to the Sagaman;  and finally from songs, which, written down about his time, are still  existing: the greater part of these last the reader will find in this  book, some inserted amongst the prose text by the original story-teller,  and some by the present translators, and the remainder in the latter  part of the book, put together as nearly as may be in the order of the  story, and forming a metrical version of the greater portion of it.    These Songs from the Elder Edda we will now briefly compare with the  prose of the Volsung Story, premising that these are the only metrical  sources existing of those from which the Sagaman told his tale.    Except for the short snatch on p. 24 (1) of our translation, nothing is  now left of these till we come to the episode of Helgi Hundings-bane,  Sigurd's half-brother; there are two songs left relating to this, from  which the prose is put together; to a certain extent they cover the same  ground; but the latter half of the second is, wisely as we think, left  untouched by the Sagaman, as its interest is of itself too great not to  encumber the progress of the main story; for the sake of its wonderful  beauty, however, we could not refrain from rendering it, and it will be  found first among the metrical translations that form the second part of  this book.    Of the next part of the Saga, the deaths of Sinfjotli and Sigmund, and  the journey of Queen Hjordis to the court of King Alf, there is no trace  left of any metrical origin; but we meet the Edda once more where Regin  tells the tale of his kin to Sigurd, and where Sigurd defeats and slays  the sons of Hunding: this lay is known as the \"Lay of Regin\".    The short chap. xvi. is abbreviated from a long poem called the  \"Prophecy of Gripir\" (the Grifir of the Saga), where the whole story  to come is told with some detail, and which certainly, if drawn out at  length into the prose, would have forestalled the interest of the tale.    In the slaying of the Dragon the Saga adheres very closely to the \"Lay  of Fafnir\"; for the insertion of the song of the birds to Sigurd the  present translators are responsible.    Then comes the waking of Brynhild, and her wise redes to Sigurd, taken  from the Lay of Sigrdrifa, the greater part of which, in its metrical  form, is inserted by the Sagaman into his prose; but the stanza relating  Brynhild's awaking we have inserted into the text; the latter part,  omitted in the prose, we have translated for the second part of our  book.
