In the first place, say Arnold and Monsieur  Harcouet, \"the person intending so to prolong his life must rub himself  well, two or three times a week, with the juice or marrow of cassia  (moelle de la casse). Every night, upon going to bed, he must put upon  his heart a plaster, composed of a certain quantity of Oriental saffron,  red rose-leaves, sandal-wood, aloes, and amber, liquified in oil of  roses and the best white wax. In the morning, he must take it off, and  enclose it carefully in a leaden box till the next night, when it must  be again applied. If he be of a sanguine temperament, he shall take  sixteen chickens--if phlegmatic, twenty-five--and if melancholy, thirty,  which he shall put into a yard where the air and the water are pure.  Upon these he is to feed, eating one a day; but previously the chickens  are to be fattened by a peculiar method, which will impregnate their  flesh with the qualities that are to produce longevity in the eater.  Being deprived of all other nourishment till they are almost dying of  hunger, they are to be fed upon broth made of serpents and vinegar,  which broth is to be thickened with wheat and bran.\" Various ceremonies  are to be performed in the cooking of this mess, which those may see in  the book of M. Harcouet, who are at all interested in the matter; and  the chickens are to be fed upon it for two months. They are then fit for  table, and are to be washed down with moderate quantities of good white  wine or claret. This regimen is to be followed regularly every seven  years, and any one may live to be as old as Methuselah! It is right to  state, that M. Harcouet has but little authority for attributing this  precious composition to Arnold of Villeneuve. It is not to be found in  the collected works of that philosopher; but was first brought to light  by a M. Poirier, at the commencement of the sixteenth century, who  asserted that he had discovered it in MS. in the undoubted writing of  Arnold.      PIETRO D'APONE.    This unlucky sage was born at Apone, near Padua, in the year 1250. Like  his friend Arnold de Villeneuve, he was an eminent physician, and a  pretender to the arts of astrology and alchymy. He practised for many  years in Paris, and made great wealth by killing and curing, and telling  fortunes. In an evil day for him, he returned to his own country,  with the reputation of being a magician of the first order. It was  universally believed that he had drawn seven evil spirits from the  infernal regions, whom he kept enclosed in seven crystal vases, until  he required their services, when he sent them forth to the ends of the  earth to execute his pleasure. One spirit excelled in philosophy; a  second, in alchymy; a third, in astrology; a fourth, in physic; a fifth,  in poetry; a sixth, in music; and the seventh, in painting: and whenever  Pietro wished for information or instruction in any of these arts, he  had only to go to his crystal vase, and liberate the presiding spirit.  Immediately, all the secrets of the art were revealed to him; and he  might, if it pleased him, excel Homer in poetry, Apelles in painting,  or Pythagoras himself in philosophy. Although he could make gold out  of brass, it was said of him, that he was very sparing of his powers in  that respect, and kept himself constantly supplied with money by other  and less creditable means. Whenever he disbursed gold, he muttered a  certain charm, known only to himself; and next morning the gold was safe  again in his own possession. The trader to whom he gave it, might lock  it in his strong box, and have it guarded by a troop of soldiers; but  the charmed metal flew back to its old master. Even if it were buried  in the earth, or thrown into the sea, the dawn of the next morning would  behold it in the pockets of Pietro. Few people, in consequence, liked to  have dealings with such a personage, especially for gold. Some, bolder  than the rest, thought that his power did not extend over silver; but,  when they made the experiment, they found themselves mistaken. Bolts and  bars could not restrain it, and it sometimes became invisible in  their very hands, and was whisked through the air to the purse of the  magician. He necessarily acquired a very bad character; and, having  given utterance to some sentiments regarding religion which were the  very reverse of orthodox, he was summoned before the tribunals of the  Inquisition to answer for his crimes as a heretic and a sorcerer. He  loudly protested his innocence, even upon the rack, where he suffered  more torture than nature could support. He died in prison ere his trial  was concluded, but was afterwards found guilty. His bones were ordered  to be dug up, and publicly burned. He was also burned in effigy in the  streets of Padua.      RAYMOND LULLI.    While Arnold de Villeneuve and Pietro d'Apone flourished in France and  Italy, a more celebrated adept than either appeared in Spain. This  was Raymond Lulli, a name which stands in the first rank among the  alchymists. Unlike many of his predecessors, he made no pretensions  to astrology or necromancy; but, taking Geber for his model, studied  intently the nature and composition of metals, without reference to  charms, incantations, or any foolish ceremonies. It was not, however,  till late in life that he commenced his study of the art. His early and  middle age were spent in a different manner, and his whole history  is romantic in the extreme. He was born of an illustrious family, in  Majorca, in the year 1235. When that island was taken from the Saracens  by James I, King of Aragon, in 1230, the father of Raymond, who was  originally of Catalonia, settled there, and received a considerable  appointment from the Crown. Raymond married at an early age; and, being  fond of pleasure, he left the solitudes of his native isle, and passed  over with his bride into Spain. He was made Grand Seneschal at the court  of King James, and led a gay life for several years. Faithless to his  wife, he was always in the pursuit of some new beauty, till his heart  was fixed at last by the lovely, but unkind Ambrosia de Castello. This  lady, like her admirer, was married; but, unlike him, was faithful to  her vows, and treated all his solicitations with disdain. Raymond was so  enamoured, that repulse only increased his flame; he lingered all night  under her windows, wrote passionate verses in her praise, neglected his  affairs, and made himself the butt of all the courtiers. One day, while  watching under her lattice, he by chance caught sight of her bosom, as  her neckerchief was blown aside by the wind. The fit of inspiration  came over him, and he sat down and composed some tender stanzas upon the  subject, and sent them to the lady. The fair Ambrosia had never before  condescended to answer his letters; but she replied to this. She told  him, that she could never listen to his suit; that it was unbecoming in  a wise man to fix his thoughts, as he had done, on any other than  his God; and entreated him to devote himself to a religious life, and  conquer the unworthy passion which he had suffered to consume him. She,  however, offered, if he wished it, to show him the fair bosom which had  so captivated him. Raymond was delighted. He thought the latter part of  this epistle but ill corresponded with the former, and that Ambrosia, in  spite of the good advice she gave him, had, at last, relented, and would  make him as happy as he desired. He followed her about from place to  place, entreating her to fulfil her promise: but still Ambrosia was  cold, and implored him with tears to importune her no longer; for that  she never could be his, and never would, if she were free to-morrow.  \"What means your letter, then?\" said the despairing lover. \"I will show  you!\" replied Ambrosia, who immediately uncovered her bosom, and exposed  to the eyes of her horror-stricken admirer, a large cancer, which had  extended to both breasts. She saw that he was shocked; and, extending  her hand to him, she prayed him once more to lead a religious life, and  set his heart upon the Creator, and not upon the creature. He went home  an altered man. He threw up, on the morrow, his valuable appointment at  the court, separated from his wife, and took a farewell of his children,  after dividing one-half of his ample fortune among them. The other  half he shared among the poor. He then threw himself at the foot of a  crucifix, and devoted himself to the service of God, vowing, as the most  acceptable atonement for his errors, that he would employ the remainder  of his days in the task of converting the Mussulmans to the Christian  religion. In his dreams he saw Jesus Christ, who said to him, \"Raymond!  Raymond! follow me!\" The vision was three times repeated, and Raymond  was convinced that it was an intimation direct from Heaven. Having put  his affairs in order, he set out on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St.  James of Compostello, and afterwards lived for ten years in solitude  amid the mountains of Aranda. Here he learned the Arabic, to qualify  himself for his mission of converting the Mahometans. He also studied  various sciences, as taught in the works of the learned men of the  East, and first made acquaintance with the writings of Geber, which were  destined to exercise so much influence over his future life.    At the end of this probation, and when he had entered his fortieth year,  he emerged from his solitude into more active life. With some remains of  his fortune, which had accumulated during his retirement, he founded a  college for the study of Arabic, which was approved of by the Pope, with  many commendations upon his zeal and piety. At this time he narrowly  escaped assassination from an Arabian youth whom he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8855"],[0,"Astral Worship (#4)"],[1,"in which chaos had been organized,  the ancient Astrologers constructed a Cosmogony, which divided the  labors of God the Son, or second person in the Trinity, into six  periods of a thousand years each; and which, answering to the six  divisions of the 12,000 year cycle corresponding to the reproductive  months of Spring and Summer, taught that in the first period he made  the earth; in the second, the firmament; in the third, vegetation; in  the fourth, the Sun and Moon and \"the stars also;\" in the fifth, the  animals, fishes, birds, etc., and in the sixth, Man.    That vegetation was made before the Sun was not an inconsistent idea to  the originators of the ancient Cosmogony. They imagined that the heat  and light, emanating from the elementary fire, were sufficient to  stimulate its growth, after which God the Son gathered it together and  made the Celestial luminaries. In the solar fables this imaginary  element is called the fire-ether, or sacred fire of the stars.        FALL AND REDEMPTION OF MAN.    Religion having been based upon the worship of personified nature, it  is evident that its founders fabricated its dogmatic element from their  conceptions of her destructive and reproductive processes as manifested  in the rotation and diversity of the seasons. The apparent retreat of  the sun from the earth, in winter, and his return in the spring,  suggesting the idea of a figurative death and resurrection of the  genius of that luminary, they applied these phenomena of the year to  man, and composed the allegories relative to his fall and redemption,  as inculcated in the Exoteric Creed. In the allegory relating to the  fall, it was taught that, after making the first human pair, the Lord  of Good or the Lord God placed them in a beautiful garden--corresponding  to the seasons of fruits and flowers or months of Spring and Summer,  with the injunction, under a penalty, not to eat of the fruit of a  certain tree. When the Lord of Evil, or Devil, symbolized by the serpent  and represented by the constellation \"Serpens\" placed in conjunction  with the Autumnal Equinox, meeting them on the confines of his dominion,  and tempting the woman, and she the man, they ate of the forbidden  fruit; thus, falling from their first estate, and committing the  original sin, they involved the whole human race in the consequences  of their disobedience. Then the Lord God, pronouncing a curse against  the serpent, clothed the man and woman with skins to protect them  against the inclemency of his, dominion as Lord of Evil, and drove them  from the garden; after which they were necessitated to earn their bread  by tilling the ground.    In, reference to the plan of redemption, the ancient Astrologers  divided the 6,000 years appropriated to man, as the duration of his  race on earth, into ten equal cycles, and taught that at the conclusion  of each God Sol, as Lord of Good, would manifest himself in the flesh,  to destroy his works as Lord of Evil, and through suffering and death  make an atonement for sin. Thus having originated the doctrines of  original sin, incarnation and vicarious atonement, as parts of the plan  of redemption, and making its finale correspond, in point of time, to  the conclusion of the 12,000 year cycle, their successors in the  priestly office ultimately inculcated the additional dogmas of the  general judgment and future rewards and punishments, as we have shown  in our introduction.    Having based the fables of the fall and redemption of man upon the idea  that he was impelled, without his volition, to pass from the dominion  of God to that of the Devil, or in other words, upon his subjection to  the inexorable necessity which makes the inclement seasons of Autumn  and Winter succeed the beneficent ones of Spring and Summer, its  authors composed the original of the text which, found in Romans viii.,  20, reads that \"The creature was made subject to vanity (Evil), not  willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope.\"    But for the popular teaching in favor of its being literal history, no  one could read the account of the fall of man, as recorded in the third  chapter of Genesis, without recognizing it as simply an allegory; or  fail to realize, the force of the argument of no fall, no redemption,  and if no redemption, no God to reward or Devil to punish; no hell to  suffer, or heaven to enjoy. The fact is that these are but antithetical  ideas which came in together, and must survive or perish together. They  cannot be separated without destroying the whole theological fabric.        INCARNATIONS OF GOD SOL.    Believing that God Sol was necessitated to remain at his post to direct  the course of the sun, the ancient astrologers conceived the idea of  teaching that, attended by a retinue of subordinate genii, he descended  to earth through the medium of incarnations at the end of 600 year  cycles, to perform the work of man's redemption and, having made Virgo  of the Zodiac the mother of the Solar divinity, they taught in their  allegorical Astronomy, or scriptures, that his incarnations were born  of a Virgin. Hence we find that God Sol, usually designated by the  title of the Word, \"was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\" John i., 14.    In a discourse upon this text delivered by Tillotson, Archbishop of  Canterbury, in the year 1680, published in the fourth volume of  Woodhouse's edition of his Grace's sermons, in the year 1744,  concerning the Incarnation of our blessed Saviour, he explains the  necessity of incarnation by saying that \"There was likewise a great  inclination in mankind to the worship of a visible Deity, so God was  pleased to appear in our nature, that they, who were so fond of a  visible Deity, might have one, even a true and natural image of God the  Father, the express image of his person.\" It only requires a little  reflection to appreciate the Prelate's covert irony and want of faith.    Having ascribed to the imaginary incarnations of God Sol the  characteristics of heaven-descending, virgin-born, earth-walking,  wonder-working, dying, resuscitated and ascending sons of God, the  ancient Astrologers attached to them the several titles of Saviour,  Redeemer, Avatar, Divine-Helper, Shiloh, Messiah, Christ; and, in  reference to their foster-father, that of Son of Man. Teaching that  they continued to make intercession for sin, after their ascension to  the right hand of the Father, they were also called Intercessors,  Mediators or Advocates with the Father. From teaching their appearance  every 600 years originated the Egyptian legend of the Phoenix, a bird  said to descend from the sun at these intervals, and, after being  consumed upon the altar in the temple of On, or city of the sun--called  Heliopolis by the Greeks--would rise from its ashes and ascend to its  source. According to the civil laws of Egypt, manhood was not attained  until the age of thirty years. Hence the earthly mission of incarnate  Saviours was made to begin at that age; and for the reason that,  relating to the apparent transit of the sun through the twelve signs of  the Zodiac, it was completed during the period of one year.    To impress the ignorant masses with the belief that the scriptures were  literal histories, and the incarnate Saviours real personages, the  ancient Astrologers caused tombs to be erected in which it was claimed  they were buried. Such sepulchres were erected to Hercules at Cadiz, to  Apollo at Delphi, and to other Saviours at many other places, to which  their respective votaries were induced to perform pilgrimages. In Egypt  the pyramids were built, partly for astronomical purposes, and partly  as tombs for Saviours, claimed to have been kings, who had once ruled  over the country; and why should we not recognize that magnificent  structure known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, at Jerusalem, as  but another of those tombs of Saviours in which no Saviour was ever  entombed?    Thus we have shown that it was God Sol, the only begotten of the  Father, or second person in the sacred Triad, to whom supreme adoration  was inculcated in all forms of the ancient Astrolatry; and that its  cultured votaries, understanding that the doctrines pertaining to the  fall and redemption of man were evolved from the figurative death and  resurrection of the solar divinity, recognized the doctrine of  incarnation as a priestly invention intended only for the ignorant  masses.        FABLE OF THE TWELVE LABORS.    The authors of the original solar fables, having lived in that remote  age in which physical prowess was recognized as the highest attribute  of humanity, conceived the idea that God Sol, while passing through his  apparent orbit, had to fight his way with the animals of the Zodiac,  and with others in conjunction with them. Hence, designating him as the  Mighty Hunter, and calling his exploits the twelve labors, they made  the incarnate Saviours the heroes of similar ones on earth, which they  taught were performed for the good of mankind; and that, after  fulfilling their earthly mission, they were exhaled to heaven through  the agency of fire. When these fables were composed the Summer Solstice  was in the sign of Leo, and making the twelve labors begin in it, the  first consisted in the killing of a lion, and the second, in rescuing a  virgin (Virgo) by the destruction of a Hydra, the constellation in  conjunction with her. Upon one of the Assyrian marbles on exhibition in  the British Museum these two labors are represented as having been  performed by a saviour by the name of Nimroud. In the constellations of  Taurus, the bull of the Zodiac, and of Orion, originally known as  Horns, in conjunction therewith, we have groupings of stars  representing the latter as one of the mighty hunters of the ancient  Astrolatry, supporting on his left arm the shield of the lion's skin,  the trophy of the first labor, and holding a club in his uplifted right "]]]
