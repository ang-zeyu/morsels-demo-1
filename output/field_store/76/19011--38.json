It had seemed as if he might lose Winifred. Winifred had _adored_ her  husband, and looked up to him as to something wonderful. Perhaps she had  expected in him another great authority, a male authority greater, finer  than her father's. For having once known the glow of male power, she  would not easily turn to the cold white light of feminine independence.  She would hunger, hunger all her life for the warmth and shelter of true  male strength.    And hunger she might, for Egbert's power lay in the abnegation of power.  He was himself the living negative of power. Even of responsibility. For  the negation of power at last means the negation of responsibility. As  far as these things went, he would confine himself to himself. He would  try to confine his own _influence_ even to himself. He would try, as far  as possible, to abstain from influencing his children by assuming any  responsibility for them. 'A little child shall lead them--' His child  should lead, then. He would try not to make it go in any direction  whatever. He would abstain from influencing it. Liberty!--    Poor Winifred was like a fish out of water in this liberty, gasping for  the denser element which should contain her. Till her child came. And  then she knew that she must be responsible for it, that she must have  authority over it.    But here Egbert silently and negatively stepped in. Silently, negatively,  but fatally he neutralized her authority over her children.    There was a third little girl born. And after this Winifred wanted no  more children. Her soul was turning to salt.    So she had charge of the children, they were her responsibility. The  money for them had come from her father. She would do her very best for  them, and have command over their life and death. But no! Egbert would  not take the responsibility. He would not even provide the money. But he  would not let her have her way. Her dark, silent, passionate authority he  would not allow. It was a battle between them, the battle between liberty  and the old blood-power. And of course he won. The little girls loved him  and adored him. 'Daddy! Daddy!' They could do as they liked with him.  Their mother would have ruled them. She would have ruled them  passionately, with indulgence, with the old dark magic of parental  authority, something looming and unquestioned and, after all, divine: if  we believe in divine authority. The Marshalls did, being Catholic.    And Egbert, he turned her old dark, Catholic blood-authority into a sort  of tyranny. He would not leave her her children. He stole them from her,  and yet without assuming responsibility for them. He stole them from her,  in emotion and spirit, and left her only to command their behaviour. A  thankless lot for a mother. And her children adored him, adored him,  little knowing the empty bitterness they were preparing for themselves  when they too grew up to have husbands: husbands such as Egbert, adorable  and null.    Joyce, the eldest, was still his favourite. She was now a quicksilver  little thing of six years old. Barbara, the youngest, was a toddler of  two years. They spent most of their time down at Crockham, because he  wanted to be there. And even Winifred loved the place really. But now, in  her frustrated and blinded state, it was full of menace for her children.  The adders, the poison-berries, the brook, the marsh, the water that  might not be pure--one thing and another. From mother and nurse it was a  guerilla gunfire of commands, and blithe, quicksilver disobedience from  the three blonde, never-still little girls. Behind the girls was the  father, against mother and nurse. And so it was.    'If you don't come quick, nurse, I shall run out there to where there are  snakes.'    'Joyce, you _must_ be patient. I'm just changing Annabel.'    There you are. There it was: always the same. Working away on the common  across the brook he heard it. And he worked on, just the same.    Suddenly he heard a shriek, and he flung the spade from him and started  for the bridge, looking up like a startled deer. Ah, there was  Winifred--Joyce had hurt herself. He went on up the garden.    'What is it?'    The child was still screaming--now it was--'Daddy! Daddy! Oh--oh, Daddy!'  And the mother was saying:    'Don't be frightened, darling. Let mother look.'    But the child only cried:    'Oh, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!'    She was terrified by the sight of the blood running from her own knee.  Winifred crouched down, with her child of six in her lap, to examine the  knee. Egbert bent over also.    'Don't make such a noise, Joyce,' he said irritably. 'How did she do it?'    'She fell on that sickle thing which you left lying about after cutting  the grass,' said Winifred, looking into his face with bitter accusation  as he bent near.    He had taken his handkerchief and tied it round the knee. Then he lifted  the still sobbing child in his arms, and carried her into the house and  upstairs to her bed. In his arms she became quiet. But his heart was  burning with pain and with guilt. He had left the sickle there lying on  the edge of the grass, and so his first-born child whom he loved so  dearly had come to hurt. But then it was an accident--it was an accident.  Why should he feel guilty? It would probably be nothing, better in two or  three days. Why take it to heart, why worry? He put it aside.    The child lay on the bed in her little summer frock, her face very white  now after the shock, Nurse had come carrying the youngest child: and  little Annabel stood holding her skirt. Winifred, terribly serious and  wooden-seeming, was bending over the knee, from which she had taken his  blood-soaked handkerchief. Egbert bent forward, too, keeping more  _sangfroid_ in his face than in his heart. Winifred went all of a lump of  seriousness, so he had to keep some reserve. The child moaned and  whimpered.    The knee was still bleeding profusely--it was a deep cut right in the  joint.    'You'd better go for the doctor, Egbert,' said Winifred bitterly.    'Oh, no! Oh, no!' cried Joyce in a panic.    'Joyce, my darling, don't cry!' said Winifred, suddenly catching the  little girl to her breast in a strange tragic anguish, the _Mater  Dolorata_. Even the child was frightened into silence. Egbert looked at  the tragic figure of his wife with the child at her breast, and turned  away. Only Annabel started suddenly to cry: 'Joycey, Joycey, don't have  your leg bleeding!'    Egbert rode four miles to the village for the doctor. He could not help  feeling that Winifred was laying it on rather. Surely the knee itself  wasn't hurt! Surely not. It was only a surface cut.    The doctor was out. Egbert left the message and came cycling swiftly  home, his heart pinched with anxiety. He dropped sweating off his bicycle  and went into the house, looking rather small, like a man who is at  fault. Winifred was upstairs sitting by Joyce, who was looking pale and  important in bed, and was eating some tapioca pudding. The pale, small,  scared face of his child went to Egbert's heart.    'Doctor Wing was out. He'll be here about half past two,' said Egbert.    'I don't want him to come,' whimpered Joyce.    'Joyce, dear, you must be patient and quiet,' said Winifred. 'He won't  hurt you. But he will tell us what to do to make your knee better  quickly. That is why he must come.'    Winifred always explained carefully to her little girls: and it always  took the words off their lips for the moment.    'Does it bleed yet?' said Egbert.    Winifred moved the bedclothes carefully aside.    'I think not,' she said.    Egbert stooped also to look.    'No, it doesn't,' she said. Then he stood up with a relieved look on his  face. He turned to the child.    'Eat your pudding, Joyce,' he said. 'It won't be anything. You've only  got to keep still for a few days.'    'You haven't had your dinner, have you, Daddy?'    'Not yet.'    'Nurse will give it to you,' said Winifred.    'You'll be all right, Joyce,' he said, smiling to the child and pushing  the blonde hair off her brow. She smiled back winsomely into his face.    He went downstairs and ate his meal alone. Nurse served him. She liked  waiting on him. All women liked him and liked to do things for him.    The doctor came--a fat country practitioner, pleasant and kind.    'What, little girl, been tumbling down, have you? There's a thing to be  doing, for a smart little lady like you! What! And cutting your knee!  Tut-tut-tut! That _wasn't_ clever of you, now was it? Never mind, never  mind, soon be better. Let us look at it. Won't hurt you. Not the least in  life. Bring a bowl with a little warm water, nurse. Soon have it all  right again, soon have it all right.'    Joyce smiled at him with a pale smile of faint superiority. This was  _not_ the way in which she was used to being talked to.    He bent down, carefully looking at the little, thin, wounded knee of the  child. Egbert bent over him.    'Oh, dear, oh, dear! Quite a deep little cut. Nasty little cut. Nasty  little cut. But, never mind. Never mind, little lady. We'll soon have it  better. Soon have it better, little lady. What's your name?'    'My name is Joyce,' said the child distinctly.    'Oh, really!' he replied. 'Oh, really! Well, that's a fine name too, in  my opinion. Joyce, eh?--And how old might Miss Joyce be? Can she tell me  that?'    'I'm six,' said the child, slightly amused and very condescending.    'Six! There now. Add up and count as far as six, can you? Well, that's a  clever little girl, a clever little girl. And if she has to drink a  spoonful of medicine, she won't make a murmur, I'll be bound. Not like  _some_ little girls. What? Eh?'    'I take it if mother wishes me to,' said Joyce.

Jewett &  Chandler, of Buffalo, N.Y., for advance sheets of the illustrations  designed to accompany the Report of the Commissioner of Patents for the  year 1868. We have frequently had occasion to commend the skill and  fidelity of these illustrations. They are most admirably done, and the  value of our Patent Office Reports is much enhanced thereby. In fact  without these illustrations the reports would be of little value.           *       *       *       *       *          Improved Treadle Motion.      It is well known that the ordinary means employed to propel light  machinery by the foot are fatiguing in the extreme and although the best  of these is the rock shaft with foot pieces, employed almost universally  in modern sewing machines, this requires the operator to sit bolt  upright, a position very trying to the back, and one which has been  shown to be productive of weakness and even permanent disease.    The device shown in the engraving employs only the swinging motion of  the leg to generate the required power.    [Illustration: GOODES' IMPROVED TREADLE MOTION.]    A pendulum, A, is pivoted to the underside of the table and carries a  heavy disk, B. To the central pivot of B is attached a foot piece, C.  The bottom of B is slotted, and through the slot passes a stationary  rod, D, which holds the bottom of the disk from vibrating while it  causes the upper part to reciprocate with the swinging of A.    To the upper part of B is pivoted a pitman which actuates the crank as  shown.    In operation the foot is placed upon the foot piece, and a swinging  motion is imparted by it to the pendulum, which is ultimately converted  into rotary motion by the crank as described. The heavy disk, B, gives  steadiness to the motion, and acts in concert with the fly wheel on the  crank shaft for this purpose; but it is not essential that this part of  the device should be a disk; any equivalent may be substituted for the  same purpose.

This is a novel and curious invention, made by Dr. Hull, of Alton, Ill.,  for the purpose of jarring off and catching the curculio from trees  infested by this destructive insect. It is a barrow, with arms and  braces covered with cloth, and having on one side a slot, which admits  the stem of the tree. The curculio catcher, or machine, is run against  the tree three or four times, with sufficient force to impart a jarring  motion to all its parts. The operator then backs far enough to bring the  machine to the center of the space between the rows, turns round, and in  like manner butts the tree in the opposite row. In this way a man may  operate on three hundred trees per hour.    A bag and a broom are carried by the operator by which the insects are  swept from the cloth and consigned to destruction.    [Illustration: CURCULIO CATCHER.]           *       *       *       *       *          Remains of a Megatherium in Ohio.      The Columbus _State Journal_, of Dec. 6, says \"there is now on  exhibition at the rooms of the State Board of Agriculture, or  headquarters of the Geological Corps, a section of the femur or thigh  bone of an animal of the mastodon species, the fossilized remains of  which were recently discovered in Union county. These remains were found  in a drift formation about three feet below the surface, and are similar  to the remains of the Megatherium found in other parts of the State.  Arrangements were made by Mr. Klippart, of the Geological Corps, to  have the skeleton or the parts thereof removed with proper care. Before  excavations had proceeded far bad weather set in, and work has been  abandoned. The section of the femur, upper part, with socket ball, is  about twenty inches in length, or about half the length of the thigh  bone. This would make the aggregate length of the bones of the leg about  ten feet. The ball is twenty-two inches in circumference, and the bone  lower down, of course, much larger. From the part of the skeleton  secured, it is estimated that the hight of the animal was twelve and a  half feet, and the skeleton entire much larger than the specimen now in  the British Museum. As this particular species, or remains thereof, have  been found only in Ohio, this specimen has been named the _Megatharium  Ohioensis_. The animals lived, it is supposed, in the period immediately  preceding the human period, and were after the elephant type.\"    Exhuming operations will be resumed in the spring, and if the skeleton  is removed in good shape or a good state of preservation, it will be set  up in the Echo room at the Capitol, where the fossils collected by the  Geological Corps are now being arranged and stored.           *       *       *       *       *          Artificial Ivory.      A process for producing artificial ivory has been published in a German  journal. The inventor makes a solution of india-rubber in chloroform and  passes chlorine gas through it. After this, he heats the solution to  drive off any excess of chlorine, and also the solvent, whereupon he has  left behind a pasty mass with which it is only necessary to incorporate  sufficient precipitated carbonate of lime or sulphate of lead, or,  indeed, any other dense white powder, to obtain a material which may be  pressed into molds to form whatever articles may be desired. The details  of this process are obviously incomplete, and the success of it may be  doubted. Only good and well masticated rubber could be employed, and  even then a dilute solution must be made, and any earthy impurities  allowed to deposit. In the next place, we are doubtful of the bleaching  action of chlorine on rubber, and, moreover, chloroform is, under some  circumstances, decomposed by chlorine. Lastly, it is clear that, to  obtain a hard material at all resembling ivory, it would be necessary to  make a \"hard cure,\" for which a considerable proportion of sulphur  would be required. The simple purification of india-rubber by means of  chloroform, would, however, furnish a mass of a very fair color.           *       *       *       *       *    An iron car made of cylindrical form is now used on the Bengal Railway,  for the carriage of cotton and other produce. It is much lighter and  safer than the ordinary car. We believe in iron cars.           *       *       *       *       *    ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND.--At the rate old subscribers are renewing, and new  ones coming in, there is a prospect that our ambition to increase the  circulation of this paper to one hundred thousand will be gratified.           *       *       *       *       *          AMERICAN AND ENGLISH RAILWAY PRACTICE CONTRASTED.      A paper on \"American Locomotives and Rolling Stock,\" read before the  Institution of Civil Engineers, in England, with an abstract on the  discussion thereon, has been forwarded to us by the publishers, William  Clowes and Sons, Stamford street and Charing Cross, London.    We have seldom met with a pamphlet of greater interest and value. The  whole subject of American as contrasted with English railroad practice  is reviewed, and the differences which exist, with the necessities for  such differences ably discussed. Mr. Colburn shows these differences  to be external rather than fundamental, and traces many of the  peculiarities of American construction to the \"initiative of English  engineers.\" The cause for the adoption and retention of these  peculiarities he attributes to \"the necessities of a new country and the  comparative scarcity of capital,\" and thinks that but for these causes\"  American railways and their rolling stock would have doubtless been  constructed, as in other countries, upon English models, and worked, in  most respects, upon English principles of management.    He reviews the origin and introduction of American features of railway  practice, and points out as the distinguishing feature of American  locomotives and rolling stock the bogie, or swiveling truck. \"Keeping  in mind the distinguishing merits of the bogie, the other differences  between English and American locomotives are differences more of costume  and of toilet than of vital principles of construction.\"    The author attributes the origin of the greater subdivision of rolling  weight and consequent coupling of wheels on American roads to the  comparatively weak and imperfect permanent way, estimating the maximum  weight per wheel as being for many years four English tuns, while three  tuns he considers, as more than the average for each coupled wheel of  American locomotives.    To follow the author through the whole of his able paper, and the  discussion which it elicited, would occupy more of our space than we  can spare for the purpose. We will, however, give in the author's own  language, an account of an experiment conducted by him in 1855 on the  Erie Railroad.    \"In the autumn of 1855, the author, at the request of Mr. (now  General) M'Callum, the manager of the Erie Railroad, took charge of an  experimental train, which he ran over the whole length of the line and  back, a total distance of nearly 900 miles.
