The stream      Rings and re-echoes with his furious cries.        Sometimes the lowing of a cow, long-drawn,        Comes from far off; and crows in strings          Pass on the upper silences.          A flock of small gray goldfinches,        Flown down with silvery twitterings,      Rustle among the birch-cones and are gone.        This day the season seems like one that heeds,        With fixed ear and lifted hand,          All moods that yet are known on earth,          All motions that have faintest birth,        If haply she may understand      The utmost inward sense of all her deeds.          IN NOVEMBER          With loitering step and quiet eye,      Beneath the low November sky,      I wandered in the woods, and found      A clearing, where the broken ground      Was scattered with black stumps and briers,      And the old wreck of forest fires.      It was a bleak and sandy spot,      And, all about, the vacant plot      Was peopled and inhabited      By scores of mulleins long since dead.      A silent and forsaken brood      In that mute opening of the wood,      So shrivelled and so thin they were,      So gray, so haggard, and austere,      Not plants at all they seemed to me,      But rather some spare company      Of hermit folk, who long ago,      Wandering in bodies to and fro,      Had chanced upon this lonely way,      And rested thus, till death one day      Surprised them at their compline prayer,      And left them standing lifeless there.        There was no sound about the wood      Save the wind's secret stir. I stood      Among the mullein-stalks as still      As if myself had grown to be      One of their sombre company,      A body without wish or will.      And as I stood, quite suddenly,      Down from a furrow in the sky      The sun shone out a little space      Across that silent sober place,      Over the sand heaps and brown sod,      The mulleins and dead goldenrod,      And passed beyond the thickets gray,      And lit the fallen leaves that lay,      Level and deep within the wood,      A rustling yellow multitude.        And all around me the thin light,      So sere, so melancholy bright,      Fell like the half-reflected gleam      Or shadow of some former dream;      A moment's golden revery      Poured out on every plant and tree      A semblance of weird joy, or less,      A sort of spectral happiness;      And I, too, standing idly there,      With muffled hands in the chill air,      Felt the warm glow about my feet,      And shuddering betwixt cold and heat,      Drew my thoughts closer, like a cloak,      While something in my blood awoke,      A nameless and unnatural cheer,      A pleasure secret and austere.          BY AN AUTUMN STREAM          Now overhead,      Where the rivulet loiters and stops,      The bittersweet hangs from the tops      Of the alders and cherries      Its bunches of beautiful berries,      Orange and red.        And the snowbirds flee,      Tossing up on the far brown field,      Now flashing and now concealed,      Like fringes of spray      That vanish and gleam on the gray      Field of the sea.        Flickering light,      Come the last of the leaves down borne,      And patches of pale white corn      In the wind complain,      Like the slow rustle of rain      Noticed by night.        Withered and thinned,      The sentinel mullein looms,      With the pale gray shadowy plumes      Of the goldenrod;      And the milkweed opens its pod,      Tempting the wind.        Aloft on the hill,      A cloudrift opens and shines      Through a break in its gorget of pines,      And it dreams at my feet      In a sad, silvery sheet,      Utterly still.        All things that be      Seem plunged into silence, distraught,      By some stern, some necessitous thought:      It wraps and enthralls      Marsh, meadow, and forest; and falls      Also on me.          SNOWBIRDS          Along the narrow sandy height        I watch them swiftly come and go,          Or round the leafless wood,        Like flurries of wind-driven snow,      Revolving in perpetual flight,          A changing multitude.        Nearer and nearer still they sway,        And, scattering in a circled sweep,          Rush down without a sound;        And now I see them peer and peep,      Across yon level bleak and gray,          Searching the frozen ground,--        Until a little wind upheaves,        And makes a sudden rustling there,          And then they drop their play,        Flash up into the sunless air,      And like a flight of silver leaves          Swirl round and sweep away.          SNOW          White are the far-off plains, and white          The fading forests grow;      The wind dies out along the height,          And denser still the snow,      A gathering weight on roof and tree,          Falls down scarce audibly.        The road before me smooths and fills          Apace, and all about      The fences dwindle, and the hills          Are blotted slowly out;      The naked trees loom spectrally          Into the dim white sky.        The meadows and far-sheeted streams          Lie still without a sound;      Like some soft minister of dreams          The snow-fall hoods me round;      In wood and water, earth and air,          A silence everywhere.        Save when at lonely intervals          Some farmer's sleigh, urged on,      With rustling runners and sharp bells,          Swings by me and is gone;      Or from the empty waste I hear          A sound remote and clear;        The barking of a dog, or call          To cattle, sharply pealed,      Borne echoing from some wayside stall          Or barnyard far a-field;      Then all is silent, and the snow          Falls, settling soft and slow.        The evening deepens, and the gray          Folds closer earth and sky;      The world seems shrouded far away;          Its noises sleep, and I,      As secret as yon buried stream,          Plod dumbly on, and dream.          SUNSET          From this windy bridge at rest,      In some former curious hour,      We have watched the city's hue,      All along the orange west,      Cupola and pointed tower,      Darken into solid blue.        Tho' the biting north wind breaks      Full across this drifted hold,      Let us stand with iced cheeks      Watching westward as of old;        Past the violet mountain-head      To the farthest fringe of pine,      Where far off the purple-red      Narrows to a dusky line,      And the last pale splendors die      Slowly from the olive sky;        Till the thin clouds wear away      Into threads of purple-gray,      And the sudden stars between      Brighten in the pallid green;        Till above the spacious east,      Slow returned one by one,      Like pale prisoners released      From the dungeons of the sun,      Capella and her train appear      In the glittering Charioteer;        Till the rounded moon shall grow      Great above the eastern snow,      Shining into burnished gold;      And the silver earth outrolled,      In the misty yellow light,      Shall take on the width of night.          WINTER-STORE          Subtly conscious, all awake,      Let us clear our eyes, and break      Through the cloudy chrysalis,      See the wonder as it is.      Down a narrow alley, blind,      Touch and vision, heart and mind;      Turned sharply inward, still we plod,      Till the calmly smiling god      Leaves us, and our spirits grow      More thin, more acrid, as we go.      Creeping by the sullen wall,      We forego the power to see,      The threads that bind us to the All,      God or the Immensity;      Whereof on the eternal road      Man is but a passing mode.        Too blind we are, too little see      Of the magic pageantry,      Every minute, every hour,      From the cloudflake to the flower,      Forever old, forever strange,      Issuing in perpetual change      From the rainbow gates of Time.        But he who through this common air      Surely knows the great and fair,      What is lovely, what sublime,      Becomes in an increasing span,      One with earth and one with man,      One, despite these mortal scars,      With the planets and the stars;      And Nature from her holy place,      Bending with unveiled face,      Fills him in her divine employ      With her own majestic joy.        Up the fielded slopes at morn,      Where light wefts of shadow pass,      Films upon the bending corn,      I shall sweep the purple grass.      Sun-crowned heights and mossy woods,      And the outer solitudes,      Mountain-valleys, dim with pine,      Shall be home and haunt of mine.      I shall search in crannied hollows,      Where the sunlight scarcely follows,      And the secret forest brook      Murmurs, and from nook to nook      Forever downward curls and cools,      Frothing in the bouldered pools.        Many a noon shall find me laid      In the pungent balsam shade,      Where sharp breezes spring and shiver      On some deep rough-coasted river,      And the plangent waters come,      Amber-hued and streaked with foam;      Where beneath the sunburnt hills      All day long the crowded mills      With remorseless champ and scream      Overlord the sluicing stream,      And the rapids' iron roar      Hammers at the forest's core;      Where corded rafts creep slowly on,      Glittering in the noonday sun,      And the tawny river-dogs,      Shepherding the branded logs,      Bind and heave with cadenced cry;      Where the blackened tugs go by,      Panting hard and straining slow,      Laboring at the weighty tow,      Flat-nosed barges all in trim,      Creeping in long cumbrous line,      Loaded to the water's brim      With the clean, cool-scented pine.

The conclusion of the adventure of Bemoy, was  extremely tragical.  A quarrel having arisen between him and the commander of the  expedition, the latter stabbed the African prince on board his own  vessel. Whether this violent deed was prompted by the heat of  passion, or by well-grounded suspicions of the prince's fidelity, was  never fully investigated, but the king learned the event with great  regret, and in consequence, gave up his design of building a fort on  the Senegal. Embassies were, however, sent to the most powerful of  the neighbouring states, nor was any pause made in the indefatigable  efforts to trace the abode of Prester John. Amongst the great  personages, to whom an embassy was sent, are mentioned the kings of  Tongubutue, (Timbuctoo,) and Tucurol, a Mandingo chief named  Mandimansa, and a king of the Foulhas, with all of whom a friendly  intercourse was established. All endeavours were, however, vain as to  the primary object, but the Portuguese thereby gained a more complete  knowledge of this part of interior Africa than was afterwards  attained in Europe till a very recent period.    There is, however, one circumstance attending these discoveries of  the Portuguese, and the embassies, which they in consequence sent to  the native princes, which deserves particular attention. There is  very little doubt existing, but that the Portuguese were acquainted  with the town and territory of Timbuctoo; and the question then  presents itself, by what means did the Portuguese succeed in  penetrating to a kingdom, which, for centuries afterwards, baffled  all the efforts of the most enterprising travellers to arrive within  some hundred miles of it. The city of Timbuctoo, for instance, was,  for a considerable length of time, the point to which all the  European travellers had directed their attention; but so vague and  indefinite were the accounts of it, that the existence of Timbuctoo  as a town, began to be questioned altogether, or at least, that the  extraordinary accounts, which had been given of it, had little or no  foundation in truth. From the time of Park to the present period, we  have information of only three Europeans reached Timbuctoo, and  considerable doubt still exists in regard to the truth of the  narrative of one of them. It is true that the intelligence of the  Portuguese embassies, as respecting the particulars of them, and the  manner in which they were conducted, has either perished, or still  remains locked up in the archives of the Lusitanian monarchy. But  when we look into the expeditions, which have been projected of late  years into the interior of Africa, we cannot refrain from drawing the  conclusion, that the character of the African people must have  undergone a change considerably for the worse, or that our  expeditions are not regulated on those principles so as to command  success.    The Portuguese in the meantime continued to extend their discoveries  in another quarter, for in 1471, they reached the Gold Coast, when  dazzled by the importance and splendour of the commodity, the  commerce of which gave name to that region, they built the fort of  Elmina or The Mine, making it the capital of their possessions on  that part of the continent. Pushing onward to Benin, they received a  curious account of an embassy said to be sent at the accession of  every new prince, to a court of a sovereign named Ogane, who was said  to reside seven or eight hundred miles in the interior. On the  introduction of the ambassadors, a silk curtain concealed the person  of his majesty from them, until the moment of their departure, when  the royal foot was graciously put forth from under the veil, and  reverence was done to it as a \"holy thing.\" From this statement it  appears that the pope of Rome is not the only person, whose foot is  treated as a \"holy thing;\" there is not, however, any information  extant, that the Portuguese ambassadors kissed the great toe of the  African prince, and therefore the superiority of the pope in this  instance is at once decided. The statement, however, of the  Portuguese ambassadors excited greatly the curiosity of the court on  their return, and it was immediately surmised by them, that this  mysterious potentate was more likely to be Prester John, than any  person whom they had yet heard of. It must, however, be remarked,  that it was a subject of great doubt and discussion to determine who  this Ogane really was.    Although in possession of the extensive coast of Africa, the  Portuguese had, as yet, no declared title to it, for that purpose,  therefore, they appealed to religion or rather the superstition of  the age. It was a maxim, which the bigots of the Vatican had  endeavoured strongly to inculcate, that whatever country was  conquered from infidel nations, became the property of the victors.  This title was, however, not completed until it was confirmed by a  special grant obtained from the pope, and accordingly the reigning  monarch of Portugal, John II., obtained the grant of all the lands  from Cape Bojador to the Indies inclusive. Robertson, speaking of  this grant, says, \"extravagant as this donation, comprehending such a  large portion of the habitable globe, would now appear even in  catholic countries, no person in the fifteenth century doubted but  that the pope, in the plenitude of his apostolic power, had a right  to confer it.\"    The grant was no sooner confirmed by the pope, than John hesitated  not a moment to style himself Lord of Guinea, giving his commanders,  at the same time, instructions that, instead of the wooden crosses,  which it had hitherto been the custom to erect in token of conquest,  pillars of stone should be raised twice the stature of a man, with  proper inscriptions, and the whole surmounted by a crucifix inlaid  with lead. The first, who sailed from Elmina, for the purpose of  planting these ensigns of dominion in regions yet undiscovered was  Diego Cam, in 1484. After passing Cape St. Catherine, he encountered  a very strong current setting direct from the land, which was still  at a considerable distance; on tasting the water, however, it was  found to be fresh, from which the conjecture was drawn, that he was  at the mouth of some great river, which ultimately turned out to be  the fact. This river has since been celebrated under the name of the  Congo, or the Zaire, lying in latitude 8 deg. south, and longitude 13 deg.  east. On reaching the southern bank of the river, Diego planted his  first pillar, after which he ascended its borders, and opened a  communication with the natives by means of signs. His first inquiry  was respecting the residence of their sovereign, and, on receiving  the information, that he resided at the distance of several days  journey inland, he determined to send a number of his men with  presents for the prince, the natives undertaking to be the guides,  and pledging themselves, within a stipulated period, to conduct them  back again. As the natives meantime passed and repassed on the most  intimate footing, Diego took the advantage of a moment, when several  of the principal persons were on board his ship, weighed anchor and  put to themselves as good and _bona fide_ Christians, as any of the  revered men, who had been sent out to instruct them. The early  missionaries, however, committed the same fault, which has  distinguished the labours of those of later periods, for they  immediately began attack one of the most venerated institutions of  the realm of Congo which was polygamy; and to the aged monarch the  privation of his wives appeared so intolerable, that he renounced the  Christian faith, and relapsed into all the impurities of paganism and  polygamy. The heir apparent, however, saw nothing so very dreadful in  the sacrifice of his wives, and braving the displeasure of his  father, remained attached to the Portuguese. The holy fathers managed  their business on this occasion with that skill, for which the cowled  tribe have ever been distinguished, and by the aid of the Apostle St.  James, and a numerous cavalry of angels, the old king died, and  Alphonso, the zealous  convert, became entitled to reign. His  brother, however, Panso Aquitimo, supported by the nobles and almost  the whole nation, raised the standard of revolt, in support of  polygamy and paganism. A civil war ensued, which is generally the  attendant upon the proselytism of a people, and Alphonso had only a  handful of Portuguese to oppose to the almost innumerable host of his  countrymen; but the holy fathers again applied to their auxiliaries,  and in consequence of apparitions in the clouds, at one time of St.  James, and another of the Virgin Mary, Alphonso always came off  victorious, and as he thereby became firmly seated on the throne, the  missionaries secured for themselves a safe and comfortable  establishment at Congo. The following account of the conduct of these  missionaries, as it is given in the Edinburgh Cabinet Library, cannot  fail to afford a considerable degree of entertainment, at the same  time, it is much to be deplored, that men engaged in so sacred a  cause, \"could play such fantastic tricks before high heaven,\" and  disgrace the doctrine, which they meant to teach.    Being reinforced by successive bodies of their brethren, the  missionaries spread over the neighbouring countries of Lundi, Pango,  Concobella and Maopongo, many tracts of which were rich and populous,  although the state of society was extremely rude. Everywhere their  career was nearly similar; the people gave them the most cordial  reception, flocked in crowds to witness and to share in the pomp of  their ceremonies; accepted with thankfulness their sacred gifts, and  received by thousands the rite of baptism. They were not, however, on  this account prepared to renounce their ancient habits and  superstitions. The inquisition, that _chef "]]]
