He specifies--(1) a yeoman and groom for the cellar; (2) a yeoman and  groom for the pantry; (3) a yeoman and groom for the buttery; (3a)  a yeoman for the ewery; (4) a yeoman purveyor; (5) a master-cook,  under-cooks, and three pastry-men; (6) a yeoman and groom in the  scullery, one to be in the larder and slaughter-house; (7) an  achator or buyer; (8) three conducts [query, errand-boys] and three  kitchen-boys.    The writer also admits us to a rather fuller acquaintance with the  mode in which the marketing was done. He says that the officers, among  other matters, \"must be able to judge, not only of the prices, but  also of the goodness of all kinds of corn, cattle, and household  provisions; and the better to enable themselves thereto, are  oftentimes to ride to fairs and great markets, and there to have  conference with graziers and purveyors.\" The higher officers were to  see that the master was not deceived by purveyors and buyers, and that  other men's cattle did not feed on my lord's pastures; they were to  take care that the clerk of the kitchen kept his day-book \"in that  perfect and good order, that at the end of every week or month it be  pied out,\" and that a true docket of all kinds of provisions be set  down. They were to see that the powdered and salted meats in the  larder were properly kept; and vigilant supervision was to be  exercised over the cellar, buttery, and other departments, even to the  prevention of paring the tallow lights.    Braithwaite dedicates a section to each officer; but I have only space  to transcribe, by way of sample, the opening portion of his account  of \"The Officer of the Kitchen:\" \"The Master-Cook should be a man of  years; well-experienced, whereby the younger cooks will be drawn the  better to obey his directions. In ancient times noblemen contented  themselves to be served with such as had been bred in their own  houses, but of late times none could please some but Italians and  Frenchmen, or at best brought up in the Court, or under London cooks:  nor would the old manner of baking, boiling, and roasting please them,  but the boiled meats must be after the French fashion, the dishes  garnished about with sugar and preserved plums, the meat covered over  with orangeade, preserved lemons, and with divers other preserved and  conserved stuff fetched from the confectioner's: more lemons and sugar  spent in boiling fish to serve at one meal than might well serve  the whole expense of the house in a day.\" He goes on to describe and  ridicule the new fashion of placing arms and crests on the dishes.  It seems that all the refuse was the perquisite of the cook and his  subordinates in a regulated proportion, and the same in the bakery and  other branches; but, as may be supposed, in these matters gross abuses  were committed.    In the \"Leisure Hour\" for 1884 was printed a series of papers on  \"English Homes in the Olden Times.\" The eleventh deals with service  and wages, and is noticed here because it affords a recital of the  orders made for his household by John Harington the elder in 1566,  and renewed by John Harington the younger, his son and High Sheriff of  Somersetshire, in 1592.    This code of domestic discipline for an Elizabethan establishment  comprises the observance of decorum and duty at table, and is at least  as valuable and curious as those metrical canons and precepts which  form the volume (Babees' Book) edited for the Early English Text  Society, etc.    There is rather too general a dislike on the part of antiquaries  to take cognisance of matter inserted in popular periodicals upon  subjects of an archaeological character; but of course the loose and  flimsy treatment which this class of topics as a rule receives in the  light literature of the day makes it perilous to use information  so forthcoming in evidence or quotation. Articles must be rendered  palatable to the general reader, and thus become worthless for all  readers alike.    Most of the early descriptions and handbooks of instruction turn,  naturally enough, on the demands and enjoyments of the great. There  is in the treatise of Walter de Bibblesworth (14th century) a very  interesting and edifying account of the arrangement of courses for  some important banquet. The boar's head holds the place of honour in  the list, and venison follows, and various dishes of roast. Among the  birds to be served up we see cranes, peacocks, swans, and wild geese;  and of the smaller varieties, fieldfares, plovers, and larks. There  were wines; but the writer only particularises them as white and red.  The haunch of venison was then an ordinary dish, as well as kid. They  seem to have sometimes roasted and sometimes boiled them. Not only  the pheasant and partridge appear, but the quail,--which is at present  scarcer in this country, though so plentiful abroad,--the duck, and  the mallard.    In connection with venison, it is worth while to draw attention to a  passage in the \"Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VII\" where, under date  of August 8, 1505, a woman receives 3s. _d_. for clarifying deer suet  for the King. This was not for culinary but for medicinal purposes, as  it was then, and much later, employed as an ointment.    Both William I. and his son the Red King maintained, as Warner shews  us, a splendid table; and we have particulars of the princely scale on  which an Abbot of Canterbury celebrated his installation in 1309. The  archbishops of those times, if they exercised inordinate authority, at  any rate dispensed in a magnificent manner among the poor and infirm  a large portion of their revenues. They stood in the place of  corporations and Poor Law Guardians. Their very vices were not without  a certain fascinating grandeur; and the pleasures of the table in  which our Plantagenet rulers outstripped even their precursors, the  earlier sovereigns of that line, were enhanced and multiplied by the  Crusades, by the commencing spirit of discovery, and by the foreign  intermarriages, which became so frequent.    A far more thorough conquest than that which the day of Hastings  signalised was accomplished by an army of a more pacific kind, which  crossed the Channel piecemeal, bringing in their hands, not bows and  swords, but new dishes and new wines. These invaders of our soil were  doubtless welcomed as benefactors by the proud nobles of the Courts  of Edward II. and Richard II., as well as by Royalty itself; and the  descriptions which have been preserved of the banquets held on special  occasions in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and even of  the ordinary style of living of some, make our City feasts of to-day  shrink into insignificance. But we must always remember that the  extravagant luxury and hospitality of the old time were germane and  proper to it, component parts of the social framework.    It is to be remarked that some of the most disturbed and disastrous  epochs in our annals are those to which we have to go for records of  the greatest exploits in gastronomy and lavish expenditure of public  money on comparatively unprofitable objects. During the period from  the accession of Rufus to the death of Henry III., and again under the  rule of Richard II., the taste for magnificent parade and sumptuous  entertainments almost reached its climax. The notion of improving the  condition of the poor had not yet dawned on the mind of the governing  class; to make the artizan and the operative self-supporting and  self-respectful was a movement not merely unformulated, but a  conception beyond the parturient faculty of a member of the Jacquerie.  The king, prince, bishop, noble, of unawakened England met their  constituents at dinner in a fashion once or twice in a lifetime, and  when the guests below the salt had seen the ways of greatness, they  departed to fulfil their several callings. These were political  demonstrations with a clear and (for the age) not irrational object;  but for the modern public dinner, over which I should be happy to  preach the funeral sermon, there is not often this or any other plea.    The redistribution of wealth and its diversion into more fruitful  channels has already done something for the people; and in the future  that lies before some of us they will do vastly more. All Augaea will  be flushed out.    In some of these superb feasts, such as that at the marriage of Henry  IV. in 1403, there were two series of courses, three of meat, and  three of fish and sweets; in which we see our present fashion to a  certain extent reversed. But at the coronation of Henry V. in 1421,  only three courses were served, and those mixed. The taste for what  were termed \"subtleties,\" had come in, and among the dishes at this  latter entertainment occur, \"A pelican sitting on her nest with her  young,\" and \"an image of St. Catherine holding a book and disputing  with the doctors.\" These vagaries became so common, that few dinners  of importance were accounted complete without one or more.    One of the minor \"subtleties\" was a peacock in full panoply. The bird  was first skinned, and the feathers, tail, head and neck having been  laid on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12296"],[0,"Camps and Trails in China (#5)"],[1,"well out of the city on a hilltop. Their  houses are built with very high ceilings and bare interiors, and as the  occupants seldom go into the city except in a sedan chair and have  \"punkahs\" waving day and night, life is made possible during the intense  heat of summer.    A telegram was awaiting us from the Reverend Harry Caldwell, with whom we  were to hunt, asking us to come to his station two hundred miles up the  river, and we passed two sweltering days repacking our outfit while Mr.  Kellogg scoured the country for an English-speaking cook.    One middle-aged gentleman presented himself, but when he learned that we  were going \"up country,\" he shook his head with an assumption of great  filial devotion and said that he did not think his mother would let him go.  Another was afraid the sun might be too hot. Finally on the eve of our  departure we engaged a stuttering Chinese who assured us that he was a  remarkable cook and exceptionally honest.    If you have never heard a Chinaman stutter you have something to live for,  and although we discovered that our cook was a shameless rascal he was  worth all he extracted in \"squeeze,\" for whenever he attempted to utter a  word we became almost hysterical. He sounded exactly like a worn-out  phonograph record buzzing on a single note, and when he finally did manage  to articulate, his \"pidgin\" English in itself was screamingly funny.    One day he came to the _sampan_ proudly displaying a piece of beef and,  after a series of vocal gymnastics, eventually succeeded in shouting:  \"Missie, this meat no belong die-cow. Die-cow not so handsome.\" Which meant  that this particular piece of beef was not from an animal which had died  from disease.    The first stage of our trip began before daylight. We rode in four-man  sedan chairs, followed by a long procession of heavily laden coolies with  our cameras, duffle-sacks, and pack baskets. The road lay through green  rice fields between terraced mountains, and we jogged along first on the  crest of a hill, then in the valley, passing dilapidated temples with the  paint flaking off and picturesque little huts half hidden in the reeds of  the winding river. It was a relief to get into the country again after  passing down the narrow village streets and to breathe fresh air perfumed  with honeysuckle.    A passenger launch makes the trip to Cui-kau at the beginning of the  rapids, but it leaves at two o'clock in the morning and is literally  crowded to overflowing with evil-smelling Chinese who sprawl over every  available inch of deck space, so that even the missionaries strongly  advised us against taking it. The passengers not infrequently are pushed  off into the water. One of the missionaries witnessed an incident which  illustrates in a typical way the total lack of sympathy of the average  Chinese.    A coolie on the Cui-kau launch accidentally fell overboard, and although a  friend was able to grasp his hand and hold him above the surface, no one  offered to help him; the launch continued at full speed, and finally  weakening, the poor man loosed his hold and sank. This is by no means an  isolated case. Some years ago a foreign steamer was burned on the Yangtze  River, and the crowds of watching Chinese did little or nothing to rescue  the passengers and crew. Indeed, as fast as they made their way to shore  many of them were robbed even of their clothing and some were murdered  outright.    Our first day on the Min River was the most luxurious of the entire  Expedition, for we were fortunate in obtaining the Standard Oil Company's  launch through the kindness of Mr. Livingston, their agent. It was large  and roomy, and the trip, which would have been worse than disagreeable on  the public boat, was most delightful. The Min is one of the most beautiful  rivers of all China with its velvet green mountains rising a thousand feet  or more straight up from the water and often terraced to the summits.    Perched on the bow of our boat was a wizened little gentleman with a  pigtail wrapped around his head, who said he was a pilot, but as he  inquired the channel of everyone who passed and ran us aground a dozen  times or more to the tremendous agitation of our captain, we felt that his  claim was not entirely justified.    The river life was a fascinating, ever-changing picture. One moment we  would pass a _sampan_ so loaded with branches that it seemed like a small  island floating down the stream. Next a huge junk with bamboo-ribbed sails  projecting at impossible angles drifted by, followed by innumerable smaller  crafts, the monotonous chant of the boatmen coming faintly over the water  to us as they passed.    When evening came we had reached Cui-kau. The _sampans_ in which we were to  spend eight days were drawn up on the beach with twenty or thirty others.  Right above us was the straggling town looking very much like the rear view  of tenement houses at home. Darkness blotted out the filth of our  surroundings but could do nothing to lessen the odors that poured down from  the village, and we ate our dinner with little relish.    Our beds were spread in the _sampans_ which we shared in common with the  four river men who formed the crew. There was only a mosquito net to screen  the end of the boat, but all our surroundings were so strange that this was  but a minor detail. As we lay in our cots we could look up at the stars  framed in the half oval of the _sampan's_ roof and listen to the sounds of  the water life grow fainter and fainter as one by one the river men beached  their boats for the night. It seemed only a few minutes later when we were  roused by a rush of water, but it was daylight, and the boats had reached  the first of the rapids which separated us from Yen-ping, one hundred and  twenty miles away.    In the late afternoon we arrived at Chang-hu-fan where Mr. Caldwell stood  on the shore waving his hat to us amidst scores of dirty little children  and the explosion of countless firecrackers. Wherever we went crackers  preceded and followed us--for when a Chinese wishes to register extreme  emotion, either of joy or sorrow, its expression always takes the form of  firecrackers.    There had been a good deal of persecution of the native Christians in the  district, and only recently a band of soldiers had strung up the native  pastor by the thumbs and beaten him senseless. He was our host that night  and seemed to be a bright, vivacious, little man but quite deaf as a result  of his cruel treatment. He never recovered and died a few weeks later. Mr.  Caldwell had come to investigate the affair, for the missionaries are  invested by the people themselves with a good deal of authority.    We spent that night in the parish house just behind the little church, a  bare schoolroom being turned over to us for our use, and it seemed very  luxurious after we had set up our cots, tables, chairs, and bath tub; but  the house was in the center of the town and the high walls shut out every  breath of pure air. The barred windows opened on a street hardly six feet  wide, and while we were preparing for bed there was a buzz of subdued  whispers outside. We switched on a powerful electric flashlight and there  stood at least forty men, women and children gazing at us with rapt  attention, but they melted away before the blinding glare like snow in a  June sun.    That night was not a pleasant one. The heat was intense, the mosquitoes  worse, and every dog and cat in the village seemed to choose our court yard  as a dueling ground in which to settle old scores. The climax was reached  at four o'clock in the morning, when directly under our windows there came  a series of ear-splitting squeals followed by a horrible gurgle. The  neighbors had chosen that particular spot and hour to kill the family pig,  and the entire process which followed of sousing it in hot water and  scraping off the hair was accompanied by unceasing chatter. Boiling with  rage we dressed and went for a walk, vowing not to spend another night in  the place but to sleep in the _sampans_.    On the whole our river men were nice fellows but they had the love of  companionship characteristic of all Chinese and the inherent desire to  huddle together as closely as possible wherever they were. On the way up  the river to Yuchi every evening they insisted on stopping at some  foul-smelling village, and it was difficult to induce them to spend the  night away from a town. Moreover, at our stops for luncheon they would  invariably ignore a shady spot and choose a sand bank where the sun beat  down like a blast furnace.    The Chinese never appear to be affected by the sun and go bareheaded at all  seasons of the year, shading their eyes with one hand or a partly opened  fan. A fan is the prime requisite, and it is not uncommon to see coolies  almost devoid of clothing, dragging a heavy load and with the perspiration  streaming from their naked bodies, energetically fanning themselves  meanwhile.    Mr. Caldwell was _en route_ to Yuchi, one of his mission stations far up a  branch of the Min River, and as there was a vague report of tiger in that  vicinity we joined him instead of proceeding directly to Yen-ping. The  tiger story was found to be merely a myth, but our trip was made  interesting by meeting Miss Mabel Hartford, the only foreign resident of  the place. She has lived in Yuchi for two years and at one time did not see  a white person for eight months with the exception of Mr. Caldwell who was  in the vicinity for three days. It requires four weeks to obtain supplies  from Foochow, there is no telegraph, and mails are very irregular, but she  enjoys the isolation and is passionately fond of her work.    She has had an interesting life and one not devoid of danger. In 1895 she  was wounded and barely escaped death in the Hwa Shan (Flower Mountain)  massacre in which ten women and one man were brutally murdered by a mob of  fanatic"]]]
