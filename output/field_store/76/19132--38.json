Volume 19, No. 548, May (#5)"],[1,"the present time, under the name of steeple  hunting; that is to say, two horsemen, drunk or sober, in or out of  their wits, fix upon a steeple or some other conspicuous distant  object, to which they make a straight cut over hedge, ditch, and gate.  We think our readers will do any thing but smile, at this rational  pastime for reasonable creatures.    \"The wild goose chase, however, at last became more regular and better  conducted. It was prescribed, that after the horse had run twelve  score yards, he was to be followed wherever he went by the others,  within a certain distance agreed upon, as twice or thrice his length.  A horse being left behind twelve score, or any limited number of  yards, was deemed beaten, and lost the match.    \"These rude and barbarous modes of horse-racing gave way, in the  reign of James I., to the more scientific, accurate, and satisfactory  trials, of the horses carrying stated weights, over measured and even  ground.    \"That monarch, as has before been intimated, brought with him from  Scotland, a strong predilection for the turf, which must have  prevailed to a considerable degree in that country, for we find, that  during his reign there, and before his accession to the crown of  England, it was deemed necessary to restrain, by an express law, the  passion of the Scots for horse-racing, and laying large bets on the  events.    \"The reign of James I. may be fairly stated, as the period when  horse-racing first became a general and national amusement. The races  appear to have been at that time conducted nearly in the same style,  as to essentials, as in the present day.    \"They were then called bell courses, the prize being a silver bell;  the winner was said to bear or carry the bell.    \"Regular prizes were now run for in various parts of England. The king  and his court, frequently attended races at Croydon and Enfield, in  the vicinity of London.    \"The first match, upon record, in this country, was one against time,  which occurred in the year 1604, when John Lepton,[6] a groom, in the  service of King James I., undertook to ride five times between London  and York, from Monday morning until Saturday night, and actually  performed the task within five days.        [6] This should be John Lenton, and the year 1603,--See _Mirror_,      vol. xvii, p. 181.    \"At this period, much attention was paid to the pedigrees of horses,  for the purpose of enhancing their reputation and worth. The training  discipline, in all its variety of regular food, clothing, physic,  airing, and gallops, was in full use; and the weights that race horses  had to carry were adjusted; the most usual of which were ten stone.    \"We find that, soon after the accession of Charles I., an ordinance  was issued, enjoining the substitution of bits or curbs, instead of  snaffles, which had probably been of late introduction in the army.  Not long afterwards, the king granted a special licence to William  Smith and others, to import into this kingdom, horses, mares and  geldings; further enjoining them to provide coach horses of the height  of fourteen hands and above, and not less than three, nor exceeding  seven years of age.    \"During the civil wars, amusements of the turf were partially  suspended, but not forgotten; for we find that Mr. Place, stud-master  to Cromwell, was proprietor of the famous horse, White Turk, (the sire  of Wormwood and Commoner) and of several capital brood mares, one of  which, a great favourite, he concealed in a vault, during the search  after Cromwell's effects, at the time of the Restoration, from which  circumstance, she took the name of the Coffin Mare, and is designated  as such in various pedigrees.    \"King Charles II., soon after his restoration, re-established the  races at Newmarket, which had been instituted by James I. He divided  them into regular meetings, and substituted, both there and at other  places, silver cups or bowls, of the value of one hundred pounds,  for the royal gift of the ancient bells, which were in consequence  generally dropped, both in name and effect.    \"William III., though not fond of the turf, paid much attention to the  breed of horses for martial service; and in his reign some of the most  celebrated stallions were imported.    \"George, Prince of Denmark, was a great amateur of horse-racing. He  obtained from his royal consort, Queen Anne, grants of royal plates  for several places, among which Epsom is, however, not mentioned.    \"King George I. is not handed down to us as a sporting character; but  towards the latter end of his reign, the change of the royal plates  into purses of hundred guineas each took place.    \"In the 13th year of the reign of King George II., an act, cap. 19.  was passed, 'to restrain and prevent the excessive increase of horse  races.'    \"By this act, after reciting 'that the great number of horse races for  small plates, prizes, or sums of money had contributed very much to  the encouragement of idleness, to the impoverishment of many of the  meaner sort of the subjects of this kingdom, and to the prejudice of  the breed of strong and useful horses;' it was enacted that no person  should, thenceforth, enter and start more than one horse, mare or  gelding, for one and the same plate, prize, or sum of money. And that  no plate, or prize of a less value than 50l. should be run for,  under the penalty of 200l.    \"It was also by the same act further enacted, that at every such race,  for a plate or prize of the value of 50l. and upwards, each horse,  if five years old, should carry ten stone; if six years old, eleven  stone; and if seven years old, twelve stone. And that the owner of any  horse, carrying less than the specified weight, should forfeit his  horse, and pay the penalty of 200l.\"    (_TO BE CONCLUDED IN OUR NEXT_.)           *       *       *       *       *        THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF NEW WORKS.           *       *       *       *       *    THE FAIR OF MAY FAIR.      The volumes of sketches of fashionable life with this quaint title  will serve to amuse a few inveterate novel-readers; while occasional  pages may induce others to take up the thread of the narrative. The  flying follies of high life, or rather, we think, of affected ton,  are hit off with truth and vigour, and there is a pleasantry in  the writer's style which is an acceptable relief to the dulness of  common-place details. We shall endeavour to detach a scene or two,  one, as a specimen of \"the art of ingeniously tormenting,\" and the  incipient waywardness of a newly-married pair.    \"From the first months of his domestication with his wife at Wellwood  Abbey, Sir Henry Wellwood had intended, had _longed_, to commence his  little system of tender remonstrance; but the slightest insinuation  of a difference of opinion was sufficient to fan the embers of  Henrietta's distemperature into a conflagration. The blaze was not  strong, indeed; for the lady had always been accustomed to find a fit  of wilfulness, or of affected despondency, more available and becoming  than one of hasty anger. But she was tolerably expert in those piquant  flippancies of speech which harass the enemy like a straggling fire;  and could contrive, when it suited her purpose, to make herself as  disagreeable as if her face had not been that of a cherub, or her  voice seraphic.    \"'A woman,' quoth La Bruyere, 'must be charming indeed, whose husband  does not repent, ten times a day, that he is a married man.' Sir Henry  Wellwood would have scoffed at the axiom. The 'idol of his soul' was  still an idol; although, like the votaries of old, he had managed to  discover that it was not wholly formed of precious metals; that its  feet were of clay! He still fancied himself the happiest of mortals;  particularly when Henrietta, in her best looks and spirits, was riding  by his side through the Wellwood plantations, listening to the project  of his intended improvements;--or seated in her boudoir sketching  designs and modelling plans for his two new lodges. Sometimes after  dinner she would busy herself with her guitar, and insist on his  attempting a second to her Italian notturno; sometimes she persuaded  him to lend her his arm towards the village, to assist in executing  that easy work of benevolence, the deplenishment of her silken purse.  At such, moments she was indeed enchanting;--and the fascinated  Wellwood was quite willing to echo the chorus of Mrs. Delafield's  visiters, that he had 'drawn a prize.'    \"But the sands of life are not formed exclusively of diamond sparks.  Flint and granite mingle in the contents of the hour-glass; and Sir  Henry often found himself required to listen to fractious complaints  of old Roddington's innovations, of Lawford's negligence--of roses  that would not blow at the gardener's bidding,--of London booksellers,  who would not send down the new novels in proper time,--of old women  who refused to be cured of their rheumatism, and young ones  who declined becoming scholars at her platting school. His own  misdemeanours, too, were frequent and unpardonable. He had a knack of  carrying off the very volume she was reading,--of losing _her_ place,  and leaving his own marked by leaving the unfortunate book sprawling  upon its face on the table, like a drunkard on the ground. He often  kept her waiting five minutes for her ride, or twenty for dinner;  would stop and detain her, in their walks, while he corrected the  practical blunders of some superannuated hedger and ditcher; had a  trick of whipping off the thistle-tops while driving her in the garden  chair, to the imminent indignation of her ponies; was sometimes seen  to nod after dinner, when the morning's run had been a good one; and  had an opinion of his own in politics, which precisely reversed those  of Lady Mandeville and her coterie.--In a word, he was often very  'tiresome!' and whenever the fair Henrietta was excited into  pronouncing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11748"],[0,"French Conversation and Composition (#5)"],[1,"ses compatriotes et les Francais?--Bonaparte etait-il du meme  avis que le Russe?--Quelle reponse spirituelle lui a-t-il faite?      21.

Mais voila que la memoire lui manque, et malgre les efforts  desesperes du souffleur, il s'arrete.

L'acteur refuse d'abord, puis,  souriant, il s'avance au bord de la rampe: \"Messieurs, dit-il,  je vous ai appeles imbeciles--c'est vrai: je vous fais mes  excuses--j'ai tort.\" Il n'en fallait pas plus pour faire oublier  l'insulte, et la salle applaudit.

LES RUGISSEMENTS DU LION ANGLAIS    Au commencement de la Revolution d'Amerique, une des foudroyantes  proclamations du roi d'Angleterre excita de vives discussions  dans une societe a Philadelphie. II y avait un membre du congres  qui ecoutait les debats sans y prendre part. Il se tourne vers  une jeune personne qui paraissait y prendre beaucoup d'interet,  et lui dit: \"Eh bien! mademoiselle, les rugissements du lion  anglais, ont-ils porte la terreur dans votre ame?--Point du tout,  monsieur, car j'ai appris dans l'histoire naturelle que c'est  quand cet animal a le plus peur qu'il rugit le plus fort.\"      A quelle epoque cette proclamation fut-elle faite?--Qu'est-ce  qu'elle excita?--Que faisait un membre du congres?--Que dit-il  a une jeune personne?--Que repondit-elle?

LA MANIERE DE DONNER OTE OU AJOUTE DU PRIX A L'AUMONE    Un jour, il y a quelques ans, je me trouvais a une fete de village  dans un chateau aux environs de Paris. Apres diner, la compagnie  alla se promener a la foire et s'amusa a jeter aux paysans des  pieces de monnaie, pour le plaisir de les voir se battre en les  ramassant. Pour moi, suivant mon humeur solitaire, j'allai me  promener tout seul de mon cote.    J'apercus une petite fille qui vendait des pommes sur un eventaire  qu'elle portait devant elle. Elle avait beau vanter sa marchandise,  elle ne trouvait plus de chalands. \"Combien toutes vos pommes? lui  dis-je.--Toutes mes pommes?\" reprit-elle. Et la voila occupee a  compter en elle-meme. \"Six sous, monsieur, me dit-elle.--Je les  prends pour ce prix, a condition que vous irez les distribuer  a ces petits savoyards que vous voyez la-bas.\" Ce qu'elle fit  aussitot. Ces enfants, qui avaient faim, furent au comble de  la joie de se voir regales ainsi que la petite fille d'avoir  vendu sa marchandise. Tout le monde fut content et personne ne  fut humilie.      Racontez cet incident a la troisieme personne.      24. RECETTE CONTRE LE FROID    Dans l'annee du grand hiver qu'il gelait a pierre fendre, le roi  Henri IV, passant en carrosse sur le Pont-Neuf a Paris, le nez  dans son manteau de fourrure, vit un jeune Gascon se promenant  gaiement avec un pourpoint de toile decoupe au cou, et un petit  manteau ouvert, comme si l'on eut ete au coeur de l'ete. Le roi  lui dit: \"N'as-tu point froid?--Non, Sire, repondit-il.--Quoi!  dit le roi, je m'etonne que tu ne geles[1] pas habille comme tu  l'es, et moi, qui suis extremement bien vetu, je puis a peine  souffrir le froid.--Ah! Sire, dit le Gascon, si votre Majeste  faisait comme moi elle n'aurait jamais froid.--Comment cela?  dit le roi.--Si vous portiez, dit le Gascon, tous vos habits  sur vous, comme je porte tolls les miens, je vous assure que  vous auriez toujours chaud.\" Le roi trouva cette reponse si bonne  qu'il lui fit faire un habit neuf.

LE LOUP ET LE CHIEN    Un loup, qui cherchait aventure, rencontra une fois, hors du  village, un chien dont il se disposait a faire immediatement  son dejeuner. Mais le chien lui representa sa maigreur, et le  pria d'attendre un pen. \"Mon maitre, lui dit-il, vient de faire  un heritage et va donner force festins aux parents et aux amis;  je ne saurais manquer d'engraisser pendant cette periode, et  vous aurez alors plus de plaisir a me manger.\" Le loup eut la  naivete de croire ce maitre hableur et le laissa partir. Quand  il revint le chercher au jour convenu, il ne le trouva pas seul.  Le ruse compere avait fait signe aux camarades des alentours:  une meute entiere tomba sur la bete fauve et la mit en pieces.    Ce loop ne connaissait pas la maxime popularisee par La Fontaine:  Un bon \"tiens\" vaut mieux que deux \"tu l'auras.\"      Savez-vous une autre expression pour: se disposer, force festins,  faire un heritage, je ne saurais, faire signe, mettre en pieces?

LE POULET DU CARDINAL DUBOIS    Le Cardinal Dubois, ministre sous la regence du duc d'Orleans,  soupait habituellement d'un poulet roti. Un soir, au moment ou  l'on allait le servir, un chien emporta tout a coup le poulet.  Quand ses gens s'en apercurent, ils en furent tout desoles, et  pour tacher de reparer le malheur ils se haterent d'en remettre  au plus tot un autre a la broche. Le cardinal demanda qu'on lui  servit[1] tout de suite son poulet. Le maitre d'hotel, prevoyant  la terrible fureur du ministre si on lui disait le fait, ou si  on lui proposait d'attendre plus tard qu'a l'heure ordinaire,  prend immediatement son parti, et lui dit avec sang-froid:  \"Monseigneur, vous avez soupe.--J'ai soupe?--Sans doute, Monseigneur;  il est vrai que j'ai ete surpris du peu de nourriture que vous  avez pris; vous paraissiez fort occupe d'affaires; quoi qu'il en  soit,[1] si cela vous plait, on vous servira un second poulet; cela  d'ailleurs ne tardera pas.\" Le medecin Chirac, qui le voyait tous  les soirs, arrive dans ce moment. Les domestiques le previennent  et le prient de les seconder. \"Parbleu! dit le cardinal, voici  quelque chose d'etrange: mes gens veulent me faire croire bon  gre mal gre que j'ai soupe, et meme que j'a"]]]
