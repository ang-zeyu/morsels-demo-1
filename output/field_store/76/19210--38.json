After the death of Queen Anne, A. lost his court  appointments, but this, as well as more serious afflictions with which he  was visited, he bore with serenity and dignity. He was an honourable and  amiable man, one of the very few who seems to have retained the sincere  regard of Swift, whose style he made the model of his own, with such  success that writings by the one were sometimes attributed to the other:  his _Art of Political Lying_ is an example. He has, however, none of the  ferocity of S.      ARGYLL, GEORGE JOHN DOUGLAS CAMPBELL, 8TH DUKE OF (1823-1900).--Statesman  and writer on science, religion, and politics, succeeded his _f._, the  7th duke, in 1847. His talents and eloquence soon raised him to  distinction in public life. He acted with the Liberal party until its  break-up under the Irish policy of Mr. Gladstone, after which he was one  of the Unionist leaders. He held the offices of Lord Privy Seal,  Postmaster-General, and Indian Secretary. His writings include _The Reign  of Law_ (1866), _Primeval Man_ (1869), _The Eastern Question_ (1879),  _The Unseen Foundations of Society_ (1893), _Philosophy of Belief_  (1896), _Organic Evolution Cross-examined_ (1898). He was a man of the  highest character, honest, courageous, and clear-sighted, and, though  regarded by some professional scientists as to a certain extent an  amateur, his ability, knowledge, and dialectic power made him a  formidable antagonist, and enabled him to exercise a useful, generally  conservative, influence on scientific thought and progress.      ARMSTRONG, JOHN, M.D. (1709-1779).--Poet, _s._ of the minister of  Castleton, Roxburghshire, studied medicine, which he practised in London.  He is remembered as the friend of Thomson, Mallet, and other literary  celebrities of the time, and as the author of a poem on _The Art of  Preserving Health_, which appeared in 1744, and in which a somewhat  unpromising subject for poetic treatment is gracefully and ingeniously  handled. His other works, consisting of some poems and prose essays, and  a drama, _The Forced Marriage_, are forgotten, with the exception of the  four stanzas at the end of the first part of Thomson's _Castle of  Indolence_, describing the diseases incident to sloth, which he  contributed.      ARNOLD, SIR EDWIN (1832-1904).--Poet, _s._ of a Sussex magistrate, was  _b._ at Gravesend, and _ed._ at King's School, Rochester, London, and  Oxford. Thereafter he was an assistant master at King Edward's School,  Birmingham, and was in 1856 appointed Principal of the Government Deccan  College, Poona. Here he received the bias towards, and gathered material  for, his future works. In 1861 he returned to England and became  connected with _The Daily Telegraph_, of which he was ultimately editor.  The literary task which he set before him was the interpretation in  English verse of the life and philosophy of the East. His chief work with  this object is _The Light of Asia_ (1879), a poem on the life and  teaching of Buddha, which had great popularity, but whose permanent place  in literature must remain very uncertain. In _The Light of the World_  (1891), he attempted, less successfully, a similar treatment of the life  and teaching of Jesus. Other works are _The Song of Songs of India_  (1875), _With Saadi in the Garden_, and _The Tenth Muse_. He travelled  widely in the East, and wrote books on his travels. He was made K.C.I.E.  in 1888.      ARNOLD, MATTHEW (1822-1888).--Poet and critic, _s._ of Dr. A., of Rugby  (_q.v._), was _b._ at Laleham and _ed._ at Rugby, Winchester, and Balliol  Coll., Oxford, becoming a Fellow of Oriel in 1845. Thereafter he was  private secretary to Lord Lansdowne, Lord President of the Council,  through whose influence he was in 1851 appointed an inspector of schools.  Two years before this he had _pub._ his first book of poetry, _The  Strayed Reveller_, which he soon withdrew: some of the poems, however,  including \"Mycerinus\" and \"The Forsaken Merman,\" were afterwards  republished, and the same applies to his next book, _Empedocles on Etna_  (1852), with \"Tristram and Iseult.\" In 1857 he was appointed to the  Professorship of Poetry at Oxford, which he held for ten years. After  this he produced little poetry and devoted himself to criticism and  theology. His principal writings are, in poetry, _Poems_ (1853),  containing \"Sohrab and Rustum,\" and \"The Scholar Gipsy;\" _Poems, 2nd  Series_ (1855), containing \"Balder Dead;\" _Merope_ (1858); _New Poems_  (1867), containing \"Thyrsis,\" an elegy on A.H. Clough (_q.v._), \"A  Southern Night,\" \"Rugby Chapel,\" and \"The Weary Titan\"; in prose he wrote  _On Translating Homer_ (1861 and 1862), _On the Study of Celtic  Literature_ (1867), _Essays in Celtic Literature_ (1868), _2nd Series_  (1888), _Culture and Anarchy_ (1869), _St. Paul and Protestantism_  (1870), _Friendship's Garland_ (1871), _Literature and Dogma_ (1873),  _God and the Bible_ (1875), _Last Essays on Church and Religion_ (1877),  _Mixed Essays_ (1879), _Irish Essays_ (1882), and _Discourses in America_  (1885). He also wrote some works on the state of education on the  Continent. In 1883 he received a pension of L250. The rationalistic  tendency of certain of his writings gave offence to many readers, and the  sufficiency of his equipment in scholarship for dealing with some of the  subjects which he handled was called in question; but he undoubtedly  exercised a stimulating influence on his time; his writings are  characterised by the finest culture, high purpose, sincerity, and a style  of great distinction, and much of his poetry has an exquisite and subtle  beauty, though here also it has been doubted whether high culture and  wide knowledge of poetry did not sometimes take the place of the true  poetic fire.    There is a bibliography of A.'s works by T.B. Smart (1892), and books  upon him have been written by Prof. Saintsbury (1899), H. Paul (1902),  and G.W.E. Russell (1904), also papers by Sir L. Stephen, F. Harrison,  and others.      ARNOLD, THOMAS (1795-1842).--Historian, _s._ of an inland revenue officer  in the Isle of Wight, was _ed._ at Winchester and Oxford, and after some  years as a tutor, was, in 1828, appointed Head Master of Rugby. His  learning, earnestness, and force of character enabled him not only to  raise his own school to the front rank of public schools, but to exercise  an unprecedented reforming influence on the whole educational system of  the country. A liberal in politics, and a zealous church reformer, he was  involved in many controversies, educational and religious. As a churchman  he was a decided Erastian, and strongly opposed to the High Church party.  In 1841 he was appointed Professor of Modern History at Oxford. His chief  literary works are his unfinished _History of Rome_ (three vols.  1838-42), and his _Lectures on Modern History_. He _d._ suddenly of  angina pectoris in the midst of his usefulness and growing influence. His  life, by Dean Stanley (_q.v._), is one of the best works of its class in  the language.      ASCHAM, ROGER (1515-1568).--Didactic writer and scholar, _s._ of John A.,  house-steward in the family of Lord Scrope, was _b._ at Kirby Wiske,  Yorkshire, and _ed._ first by Sir Humphrey Wingfield, and then at St.  John's Coll., Cambridge, where he devoted himself specially to the study  of Greek, then newly revived, and of which, having taken a fellowship, he  became a teacher. He was likewise noted for his skill in penmanship,  music, and archery, the last of which is the subject of his first work,  _Toxophilus_, _pub._ in 1545, and which, dedicated to Henry VIII., gained  him the favour of the King, who bestowed a pension upon him. The objects  of the book are twofold, to commend the practice of shooting with the  long bow as a manly sport and an aid to national defence, and to set the  example of a higher style of composition than had yet been attempted in  English. Soon afterwards he was made university orator, and master of  languages to the Lady (afterwards Queen) Elizabeth. He then went abroad  in various positions of trust, returning on being appointed Latin  Secretary to Edward VI. This office he likewise discharged to Mary and  then to Elizabeth--a testimony to his tact and caution in these changeful  times. His principal work, _The Schoolmaster_, a treatise on education,  was printed by his widow in 1570. He also _pub._ a book on the political  state of Germany.    Editions: of _Toxophilus_, Arber; _Schoolmaster_, Arber, also Mayer  (1883); English works, Bennet (1767), with life by Dr. Johnson; whole  works, Giles (1864-5).      ASGILL, JOHN (1659-1738).--Eccentric writer, student at the Middle  Temple, 1686, and called to the Bar 1692. In 1699 he _pub._ in an unlucky  hour a pamphlet to prove that death was not obligatory upon Christians,  which, much to his surprise, aroused the public wrath and led to his  expulsion from the Irish and English House of Commons successively. A.  thereafter fell on evil days, and passed the rest of his life between the  Fleet and the King's Bench, where, strange to say, his zeal as a  pamphleteer continued unabated. He _d._ in 1738.      ASHMOLE, ELIAS (1617-1692).--Antiquary, was _ed._ at Lichfield, and  became a solicitor in 1638. On the breaking out of the Civil War he  sided with the royalists; went to Oxford and studied science, including  astrology. The result of his studies in this region of mystery was his  _Theatrum Chymicum Britannicum_, which gained him great repute and the  friendship of John Selden. His last astrological treatise was _The Way to  Bliss_, which dealt with the subject of \"the philosopher's stone.\" He  also wrote various works on antiquarian subjects, and a _History of the  Order of the Garter_. A. held various posts under government, and  presented to the University of Oxford a valuable collection of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13241"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#5)"],[1,"Sprang from the fires of sunset, till deep night    Swept with her cloud of stars the face of heaven,    For the quick music, from the pavement rung    Where beat the impatient hoof-strokes of the steed,    Whose mane of silver, like a wave of light,    Bathed the caressing hand I pined to clasp!    It is as if a song-lark, towering high    In pride of place, should stoop her sun-bathed wing,    Low as the poor hum of the grasshopper.      I scorn thee not, old man; no haunting ghost    Born of the darkness of thy perjury    Crosses the white tent of my dreaming now    But for myself, that I should so have loved!--    The sweet folds of that blessed charity,    Pure as the cold veins of Pentelicus,    Were all too narrow now to hide away    One burning spot of shame--the wretched price    Of proving traitor to the wondrous star    That with a cloud of splendor wraps my way.    And yet, from the bright wine-cup of my life,    The rosy vintage, bubbling to the brim,    Thou With a passionate lip didst drain away    And to God's sweet gift--human sympathy--    Making my bosom dumb as the dark grave,    Didst leave me drifting on the waste of life,    A fruitless pillar of the desert dust;    For, from the ashes of a ruined hope    There springs no life but an unwearied woe    That feeding upon sunken lip and cheek    Pushes its victims from mortality.    Vainly the light rain of the summer time    Waters the dead limbs of the blasted oak.      Love is the worker of all miracles;    And if within some cold and sunless cave    Thou hadst lain lost and dying, prompted not    My feet had struck that pathway, and I could,    With the neglected sunshine of my hair,    Have clasped thee from the hungry jaws of Death,    And on my heart, as on a wave of light    Have lulled thee to the beauty of soft dreams.      Weak, weak imagination! be dissolved    Like a chance snowflake in a sea of fire.    Let the poor-spirited children of Despair    Hang on the sepulchre of buried Hope    The fadeless garlands of undying song.    Though such gift turned on its pearly hinge    Sweet Mercy's gate, I would not so debase me.    Shut out from heaven, I, by the arch-fiend's wing,    As by a star, would move, and radiantly    Go down to sleep in Fame's bright arms the while    Hard by, her handmaids, the still centuries    Lilies and sunshine braided for my brow.      Angel of Darkness, give, O give me hate    For the blind weakness of my passionate love!    And if thou knowest sweet pity, stretch thy wing,    Spotted with sin and seamed with veins of fire,    Between the gate of heaven and my life's prayer.    For loving, thou didst leave me; and, for that    The lowly straw-roof of a peasant's shed    Sheltered my cradle slumbers, and that Morn,    Clasping about my neck her dewy arms,    Drew to the mountains my unfashioned youth,    Where sunbeams built bright arches, and the wind    Winnowed the roses down about my feet    And as their drift of leaves my bosom was,    Till the cursed hour, when pride was pillowed there,    Crimsoned its beauty with the fires of hell.    God hide from me the time when first I knew    Thy shame to call a low-born maiden, Bride!    Methinks I could have lifted my pale hands    Though bandaged back with grave-clothes, in that hour    To cover my hot forehead from thy kiss.    For the heart strengthens when its food is truth,    And o'er the passion-shaken bosom, trail    And burn the lightnings of its love-lit fires    Like a bright banner streaming on the storm.      The day was almost over; on the hills    The parting light was flitting like a ghost,    And like a trembling lover eve's sweet star,    In the dim leafy reach of the thick woods,    Stood gazing in the blue eyes of the night.    But not the beauty of the place nor hour    Moved my wild heart with tempests of such bliss    As shake the bosom of a god, new-winged,    When first in his blue pathway up the skies    He feels the embrace of immortality.      A little moment, and the world was changed--    Truth, like a planet striking through the dark,    Shone cold and clear, and I was what I am,    Listening along the wilderness of life    For faint echoes of lost melody.    The moonlight gather'd itself back from me    And slanted its pale pinions to the dust.    The drowsy gust, bedded in luscious blooms,    Startled, as 'twere at the death-throes of peace,    Down through the darkness moaningly fled off.      O mournful Past! how thou dost cling and cling--    Like a forsaken maiden to false hope--    To the tired bosom of the living hour,    Which, from thy weak embrace, the future time    Jocundly beckons with a roseate hand.    And, round about me honeyed memories drift    From the fair eminences of young hope,    Like flowers blown down the hills of Paradise,    By some soft wave of golden harmony,    Until the glorious smile of summers gone    Lights the dull offing of the sea of Death.    And though no friend nor brother ever made    My soul the burden of one prayer to Heaven,    I dread to go alone into the grave,    And fold my cold arms emptily away    From the bright shadow of such loveliness.      Can the dull mist where swart October hides    His wrinkled front and tawny cheek, wind-shorn,    Be sprinkled with the orange fire that binds    Away from her soft lap o'erbrimmed with flowers,    The dew-wet tresses of the virgin May?    Or can the heart just sunken from the day    Feed on the beauty of the noontide smile?--    O it is well life's fair things fade so soon,    Else we could never take our clinging hands    From Beauty's nestling bosom--never put    The red wine of love's kisses sternly back,    And feel the dull dust sitting on our lips    Until the very grass grew over us.    O it is well! else for this beautiful life    Our overtempted hearts would sell away    The shining coronals of Paradise.      In the gray branches of the oaks, starlit,    I hear the heavy murmurs of the winds,    Like the low plains of evil witches, held    By drear enchantments from their demon loves.    Another night-time, and I shall have found    A refuge from their mournful prophecies.      Come, dear one, from my forehead smooth away    Those long and heavy tresses, still as bright    As when they lay 'neath the caressing hand    That unto death betrayed me. Nay, 'tis well!    I pray you do not weep; or soon or late,    Were this sad doom unsaid, their light had filled    The empty bosom of the waiting grave.    There, now I think I have no further need--    For unto all at last there comes a time    When no sweet care can do us any good!    Not in my life that I remember of,    Could my neglect have injured any one,    And if I have by my officious love,    Thrown harmful shadows in the way of some,    Be piteous to my natural weakness, friends:    I never shall offend you any more!      And now, most melancholy messenger,    Touch my eyes gently with Sleep's heavy dew.    I have no wish to struggle from thy arms,    Nor is there any hand would hold me back.    To die, is but the common heritage;    But to unloose the clasp that to the heart    Folds the dear dream of love, is terrible--    To see the wildering visions fade away,    As the bright petals of the young June rose    Shook by some sudden tempest. On the grave    Light from the open sepulchre is laid,    And Faith leans yearningly away to heaven,    But life hath glooms wherein no light may come!      The night methinks is dismal, yet I see    Over yon hill one bright and steady star    Divide the darkness with its fiery wedge,    And sprinkle glory on the lap of earth.    Even so, above the still homes of the dead    The benedictions of the living lie.    Gatherers of waifs of beauty are we here,    Building up homes of love for alien hearts    That hate us for our trouble. When we see    The tempest hiding from us the sun's face,    About our naked souls we build a wall    Of unsubstantial shadows, and sit down    Hugging false peace upon the edge of doom.    From the voluptuous lap of time that is,    Like a sick child from a kind nurse's arms,    We lean away, and long for the far off.    And when our feet through weariness and toll    Have gained the heights that showed so brightly well,    Our blind and dizzied vision sees too late    The cool broad shadows trailing at the base.    And then our wasted arms let slip the flowers,    And our pained bosoms wrinkle from the fair    And smooth proportions of our primal years,    And so our sun goes down, and wistful death    Withdraws love's last delusion from our hearts,    And mates us with the darkness. Well, 'tis well!           *       *       *       *       *    TWO COUNTRY SONNETS.    I.--THE CONTRAST      But yester e'en the city's streets I trod      And breathed laboriously the fervid air;      Panting and weary both with toil and care,    I sighed for cooling breeze and verdant sod.    This morn I rose from slumbers calm and deep,      And through the casement of a rural inn,      I saw the river with its margins green,    All placid and delicious as my sleep.    Like pencilled lines upon a tinted sheet      The city's spires rose distant on the sky;    Nor sound familiar to the crowded street      Assailed my ear, nor busy scene mine eye;    I saw the hills, the meadows and the river--    I heard cool waters plash and green leaves quiver.    II.--PLEASURE.      These sights and sounds refreshed me more than wine;      My pulses bounded with a reckless play,      My heart exalted like the rising day.    Now--did my lips exclaim--is pleasure mine;    A sweet delight shall fold me in its thrall;      To day, at least, I'll feel the bliss of life;      Like uncaged bird,--each limb with freedom rife--    I'll sip a thousand sweets--enjoy them all!      The will thus earnest could not be denied;      I beckoned Pleasure and she gladly came:    O'er hill and vale I roamed at her dear side--      And made the"]]]
