The men of the two regiments were on the  best of terms, both having served together during mining troubles in  Montana. Still greater was the surprise of everyone when another order  was issued from the same source directing that the white regiment  should make coffee first, all the time, and detailing a guard to  see that the order was carried out. All of these things were done  seemingly to humiliate us and without a word of protest from our  officers. We suffered without complaint. God only knows how it was we  lived through those fourteen days on that miserable vessel. We lived  through those days and were fortunate enough not to have a burial at  sea.    OPERATIONS AGAINST SANTIAGO.    We landed in Cuba June 22, 1898. Our past hardships were soon  forgotten. It was enough to stir the heart of any lover of liberty to  witness that portion of Gomez's ragged army, under command of General  Castillo, lined up to welcome us to their beautiful island, and to  guide and guard our way to the Spanish strongholds. To call it a  ragged army is by no means a misnomer. The greater portion of those  poor fellows were both coatless and shoeless, many of them being  almost nude. They were by no means careful about their uniform. The  thing every one seemed careful about was his munitions of war, for  each man had his gun, ammunition and machete. Be it remembered that  this portion of the Cuban army was almost entirely composed of black  Cubans.    After landing we halted long enough to ascertain that all the men of  the regiment were \"present or accounted for,\" then marched into the  jungle of Cuba, following an old unused trail. General Shafter's  orders were to push forward without delay. And the 25th Infantry  has the honor of leading the march from the landing at Baiquiri or  Daiquiri (both names being used in official reports) the first day the  army of invasion entered the island. I do not believe any newspaper  has ever published this fact.    There was no time to be lost, and the advance of the American army of  invasion in the direction of Santiago, the objective point, was rapid.  Each day, as one regiment would halt for a rest or reach a suitable  camping ground, another would pass. In this manner several regiments  had succeeded in passing the 25th Infantry by the morning of June  24th. At that time the 1st Volunteer Cavalry (Rough Riders) was  leading the march.    THE FIRST BATTLE.    [Illustration: Charge on El Caney--Twenty-Fifth Infantry.]    On the morning of June 24th the Rough Riders struck camp early, and  was marching along the trail at a rapid gait, at \"route step,\" in any  order suitable to the size of the road. Having marched several miles  through a well-wooded country, they came to an opening near where the  road forked. They turned into the left fork; at that moment, without  the least warning, the Cubans leading the march having passed on  unmolested, a volley from the Spanish behind a stone fort on top of  the hill on both sides of the road was fired into their ranks. They  were at first disconcerted, but rallied at once and began firing in  the direction from whence came the volleys. They could not advance,  and dared not retreat, having been caught in a sunken place in the  road, with a barbed-wire fence on one side and a precipitous hill on  the other. They held their ground, but could do no more. The Spanish  poured volley after volley into their ranks. At the moment when  it looked as if the whole regiment would be swept down by the  steel-jacketed bullets from the Mausers, four troops of the 10th  U.S. Cavalry (colored) came up on \"double time.\" Little thought the  Spaniards that these \"smoked yankees\" were so formidable. Perhaps they  thought to stop those black boys by their relentless fire, but those  boys knew no stop. They halted for a second, and having with them a  Hotchkiss gun soon knocked down the Spanish improvised fort, cut the  barb-wire, making an opening for the Rough Riders, started the charge,  and, with the Rough Riders, routed the Spaniards, causing them to  retreat in disorder, leaving their dead and some wounded behind. The  Spaniards made a stubborn resistance. So hot was their fire directed  at the men at the Hotchkiss gun that a head could not be raise, and  men crawled on their stomachs like snakes loading and firing. It is  an admitted fact that the Rough Riders could not have dislodged the  Spanish by themselves without great loss, if at all.    The names of Captain A.M. Capron, Jr., and Sergeant Hamilton Fish,  Jr., of the Rough Riders, who were killed in this battle, have been  immortalized, while that of Corporal Brown, 10th Cavalry, who manned  the Hotchkiss gun in this fight, without which the American loss in  killed and wounded would no doubt have been counted by hundreds, and  who was killed by the side of his gun, is unknown by the public.    At the time the battle of the Rough Riders was fought the 25th  Infantry was within hearing distance of the battle and received orders  to reinforce them, which they could have done in less than two hours,  but our Brigade Commander in marching to the scene of battle took the  wrong trail, seemingly on purpose, and when we arrived at the place of  battle twilight was fading into darkness.    The march in the direction of Santiago continued, until the evening of  June 30th found us bivouacked in the road less than two miles from El  Caney. At the first glimpse of day on the first day of July word was  passed along the line for the companies to \"fall in.\" No bugle call  was sounded, no coffee was made, no noise allowed. We were nearing the  enemy, and every effort was made to surprise him. We had been told  that El Caney was well fortified, and so we found it.    The first warning the people had of a foe being near was the roar of  our field artillery and the bursting of a shell in their midst. The  battle was on. In many cases an invading army serves notice of a  bombardment, but in this case it was incompatible with military  strategy. Non-combatants, women and children all suffered, for to have  warned them so they might have escaped would also have given warning  to the Spanish forces of our approach. The battle opened at dawn and  lasted until dark. When our troops reached the point from which they  were to make the attack, the Spanish lines of entrenched soldiers  could not be seen.    [Illustration: CORPORAL BROWN. (Who was killed at a Hotchkiss gun  while shelling the Spanish block-house to save the Rough Riders.)]    The only thing indicating their position was the block-house situated  on the highest point of a very steep hill. The undergrowth was so  dense that one could not see, on a line, more than fifty yards ahead.  The Spaniards, from their advantageous position in the block-house  and trenches on the hill top, had located the American forces in the  bushes and opened a fusillade upon them. The Americans replied with  great vigor, being ordered to fire at the block-house and to the right  and left of it, steadily advancing as they fired. All of the regiments  engaged in the battle of El Caney had not reached their positions  when the battle was precipitated by the artillery firing on the  block-house. The 25th Infantry was among that number. In marching to  its position some companies of the 2d Massachusetts Volunteers were  met retreating; they were completely whipped, and took occasion to  warn us, saying: \"Boys, there is no use to go up there, you cannot  see a thing; they are slaughtering our men!\" Such news made us feel  \"shaky,\" not having, at the time, been initiated. We marched up,  however, in order and were under fire for nine hours. Many barbed-wire  obstructions were encountered, but the men never faltered. Finally,  late in the afternoon, our brave Lieutenant Kinnison said to another  officer: \"We cannot take the trenches without charging them.\" Just as  he was about to give the order for the bugler to sound \"the charge\" he  was wounded and carried to the rear. The men were then fighting like  demons. Without a word of command, though led by that gallant and  intrepid Second Lieutenant J.A. Moss, 25th Infantry, some one gave a  yell and the 25th Infantry was off, alone, to the charge. The 4th U.S.  Infantry, fighting on the left, halted when those dusky heroes made  the dash with a yell which would have done credit to a Comanche  Indian. No one knows who started the charge; one thing is certain,  at the time it was made excitement was running high; each man was a  captain for himself and fighting accordingly. Brigadier Generals,  Colonels, Lieutenant-Colonels, Majors, etc., were not needed at the  time the 25th Infantry made the charge on El Caney, and those officers  simply watched the battle from convenient points, as Lieutenants and  enlisted men made the charge alone. It has been reported that the 12th  U.S. Infantry made the charge, assisted by the 25th Infantry, but it  is a recorded fact that the 25th Infantry fought the battle alone, the  12th Infantry coming up after the firing had nearly ceased. Private  T.C. Butler, Company H, 25th Infantry, was the first man to enter the  block-house at El Caney, and took possession of the Spanish flag for  his regiment. An officer of the 12th Infantry came up while Butler  was in the house and ordered him to give up the flag, which he was  compelled to do, but not until he had torn a piece off the flag to  substantiate his report to his Colonel of the injustice which had  been done to him. Thus, by using the authority given him by his  shoulder-straps, this officer took for his regiment that which had  been won by the hearts' blood of some of the bravest, though black,  soldiers of Shafter's army.    The charge of El Caney has been little spoken of, but it was quite as  great a show of bravery as the famous taking of San Juan Hill.    A word more in regard to the charge.

Volume 13, No. 351, (#5)"],[1,"*       *       *       *       *      GERMAN SCHOOLS.    A law respecting schools has existed, more or less, in the states of the  south of Germany, for above a century, but which has been greatly  improved within the last thirty years. By this law, parents are  compelled to send their children to school, from the age of six to  fourteen years, where they must be taught reading, writing, and  arithmetic, but where they may acquire as much additional instruction in  other branches as their parents choose to pay for. To many of the  schools of Bavaria large gardens are attached, in which, the boys are  taught the principal operations of agriculture and gardening in their  hours of play; and, in all the schools of the three states, the girls,  in addition to the same instruction as the boys, are taught knitting,  sewing, embroidery, &c. It is the duty of the police and priest (which  may be considered equivalent to our parish vestries) of each commune or  parish, to see that the law is duly executed, the children sent  regularly, and instructed duly. If the parents are partially or wholly  unable to pay for their children, the commune makes up the deficiency.  Religion is taught by the priest of the village or hamlet; and where, as  is frequently the case in Wurtemberg, there are two or three religions  in one parish, each child is taught by the priest of its parents; all of  which priests are, from their office, members of the committee or vestry  of the commune. The priest or priests of the parish have the regular  inspection of the school-master, and are required by the government to  see that he does his duty, while each priest, at the same time, sees  that the children of his flock attend regularly. After the child has  been the appointed number of years at school, it receives from the  schoolmaster, and the priest of the religion to which it belongs, a  certificate, without which it cannot procure employment. To employ any,  person under twenty-one, without such a certificate, is illegal, and  punished by a fixed fine, as is almost every other offence in this part  of Germany; and the fines are never remitted, which makes punishment  always certain. The schoolmaster is paid much in the same way as in  Scotland; by a house, a garden, and sometimes a field, and by a small  salary from the parish, and by fixed rates for the children.    A second law, which is coeval with the school law, renders it illegal  for any young man to marry before he is twenty-five, or any young woman  before she is eighteen; and a young man, at whatever age he wishes to  marry, must show, to the police and the priest of the commune where he  resides, that he is able, and has the prospect, to provide for a wife  and family.--_London's Mag. Nat. Hist._             *       *       *       *       *    EATING AND WRITING.      Ovid, Horace, and Virgil all frequented the tables of the great; Cato  warmed his virtue with wine; Shakspeare kept up his _verve_ with stolen  venison; Steele and Addison wrote their best papers over a bottle; Sir  Walter Scott is famed for good housekeeping; and I know authors who love  to dine like lords. Even booksellers do their spiriting more gently for  good fare, and bid for an author the most spiritedly after dinner.    There is not a more vulgar mistake than that of confounding good eating  with gluttony and excess. It is not because a man gets twenty or  five-and-twenty guineas per sheet for a dashing article, and has taste  to expend his well-earned cash upon a cook who knows how to dress a  dinner, that he is necessarily to gorge himself like a mastiff with  sheep's paunch. On the contrary, if he means to preserve the powers of  his palate intact, he must \"live cleanly as a nobleman should do.\" The  fat-witted people in the City are not nice in their eating, quantity  being more closely considered by them than quality. There is, I admit,  something in the good man's concluding conjecture, that \"the sort of  diet men observe influences their style.\" I should know an \"heavy-wet\"  man at the third line; and I can tell to a nicety when Theodore Hook  writes upon claret, and when he is inspired by the over-heating and  acrimonious stimulus of Max. Hayley obviously composed upon tea and  bread and butter. Dr. Philpots may be nosed a mile off for priestly port  and the fat bulls of Basan; and Southey's Quarterly articles are written  on an empty stomach, and before his crudities, like the breath of Sir  Roger de Coverley's barber, have been \"mollified by a breakfast.\"--_New  Monthly Mag._             *       *       *       *       *    SACRED POETRY.      Songs and hymns, in honour of their Gods, are found among all people who  have either religion or verse. There is scarcely any pagan poetry,  ancient or modern, in which allusions to the national mythology are not  so frequent as to constitute the most copious materials, as well as the  most brilliant embellishments. The poets of Persia and Arabia, in like  manner, have adorned their gorgeous strains with the fables and morals  of the Koran. The relics of Jewish song which we possess, with few  exceptions, are consecrated immediately to the glory of God, by whom,  indeed, they were inspired. The first Christians were wont to edify  themselves in psalms and hymns, and spiritual songs; and though we have  no specimens of these left, except the occasional doxologies ascribed to  the redeemed in the Book of Revelation, it cannot be doubted that they  used not only the psalms of the Old Testament, literally, or  accommodated to the circumstances of a new and rising Church, but that  they had original lays of their own, in which they celebrated the  praises of Christ, as the Saviour of the world. In the middle ages, the  Roman Catholic and Greek churches statedly adopted singing as an  essential part of public worship; but this, like the reading of the  Scriptures, was too frequently in an unknown tongue, by an affectation  of wisdom, to excite the veneration of ignorance, when the learned, in  their craftiness, taught that \"Ignorance is the mother of devotion;\" and  Ignorance was very willing to believe it. At the era of the Reformation,  psalms and hymns, in the vernacular tongue, were revived in Germany,  England, and elsewhere, among the other means of grace, of which  Christendom had been for centuries defrauded.--_Montgomery._             *       *       *       *       *    SUPERSTITION.      Grievously are they mistaken who think that the revival of literature  was the death of superstition--that ghosts, demons, and exorcists  retreated before the march of intellect, and fled the British shore  along with monks, saints, and masses. Superstition, deadly superstition,  may co-exist with much learning, with high civilization, with any  religion, or with utter irreligion. Canidia wrought her spells in the  Augustan age, and Chaldean fortune-tellers haunted Rome in the sceptical  days of Juvenal. Matthew Hopkins, the witch-finder, and Lilly, the  astrologer, were contemporaries of Selden, Harrington, and Milton.  Perhaps there never was a more superstitious period than that which  produced Erasmus and Bacon. _--Blackwood's Mag._             *       *       *       *       *    \"FELLOW\" FEELING.      A \"certain exalted personage,\" as the newspapers would say, commanded  the attendance of a physician, who was only a Licentiate, and, thereby,  struck consternation throughout the whole body of \"Fellows.\" The great  men already in attendance were dreadfully alarmed and confounded by this  terrible subversion of established College etiquette. \"Sire!\" said one  of them, \"we humbly acquaint your Majesty, with all dutiful submission  that as Dr.---- is not a Fellow, it is contrary to rule and custom to  meet him in attendance here.\"--\"A Fellow?\" asked his Majesty; \"what mean  ye?\" The learned physician explained. \"Well, make him a Fellow, then,\"  was his Majesty's quick reply; and he was accordingly made one!             *       *       *       *       *    CULTIVATION OF WASTE LANDS.      No man at all acquainted with the principles of fertility and the  present state of British tillage, can for a moment doubt that a very  large quantity of waste land is scattered over the different districts  of this country, which is not only susceptible of improvement, but which  would yield an ample return for any amount of labour which could, for  centuries to come, be spared from the cultivation of our own land. To be  fully convinced of this fact, no man need do more than ride twenty miles  in any direction from the metropolis. Let him select whatever road he  may choose for his excursion, and he will find tracts of land, forming  in the aggregate a very considerable quantity, which at this moment  remain in the hands of nature--which man has never made the slightest  effort to reclaim. Even the hebdomadal excursions of the citizen will  conduct him over or near many such scenes. What Gilpin, living within  the sound of Bow-bells, does not know Epping and Hainault Forests,  Hounslow, Putney, and Black Heaths, Brook Green, Turnham Green,  Wandsworth, Esher, Sydenham, Hays, and various other Commons? Within a  circle of twenty miles around the largest and most opulent city in the  world, we thus discover a large quantity of land, which cultivation  would render highly productive, but which, in its present state of  waste, is of little or no value to the public. And this land, situated  in the very outskirts of the metropolis, continues to be utterly  neglected, if not entirely overlooked, at a moment when the whole  kingdom resounds with the groans of those who argue that the population  of this country has outrun the means of subsisting them. As the  traveller advances in his journey from the metropolis, the waste becomes  more extensive, if not more numerous. The English wastes, which amount  to about five millions of acres, are more valuable than those of"]]]
