Let  the Patient drink of this morning and evening, halfe a pint at a  time, and let him sweat after it two hours. His drink at his Meals  must be thus used, put into the same vessel where the former was  made, to the _Guaicum_ that is left, three pottels of _Ale_, and not  _Whey_, let it boyle to the one halfe, let him drink thereof at all  times, and at his meale, which must be but one in a day, and that  so little, that he may rise hungry.

Oyle of Wormwood is good for straines and bruises, and to comfort  the stomach; it is made of the green Hearb, as are the Oyle  of _Cammomile_, _Rue_, and _Mint_, are made.

Take a quart of _White wine_ Vineger, and halfe a quarter of a  pound of fine beaten _Sugar_, and mix them together, then take  your _Cowslips_, pull them out of the podds, and cut off the green  knobs at the lower end, put them into the pot or glasse wherein  you mind to keep them, and well shaking the _Vineger_ and _Sugar_  together in the glasse wherein they were before, powre it upon  the _Cowslips_, and so stirring them morning and evening to make  them settle for three weeks, keep them for your use.      _To Conserve Cowslips_.

These are rather Candied then Conserved _Cowslips_.      _To Preserve all kinde of Flowers in the Spanish  Candy in Wedges_.    Take _Violets_, _Cowslips_, or any other kinde of Flowers, pick  them, and temper them with the pap of two roasted _Apples_, and a  drop or two of _Verjuice_, and a graine of _Muske_, then take halfe a  pound of fine hard _Sugar_, boyle it to the height of _Manus Christi_,  then mix them together, and pour it on a wet Pye plate, then cut it  it in Wedges before it be through cold, gild it, and so you may  box it, and keep it all the year.

[Illustration: Beanes]    _Unguentum Sanativum_.    Take of _Terpentine_ one pound, _Wax_ six ounces, Oyle of _Cammomile_  halfe a pint, put all these together in a pan, and put to them  a handfull of _Cammomile_, bruised, or cut very small, boyle them  upon a soft fire till they be well melted, and no more; then take  it from the fire, and strayne it into a clean pan, and so let it coole  all night, and in the morning put it up for your use.

Yet, after all these reflections, I was covetous enough to make one  more attempt on Chudakarna's meal, and got a blow from the split cane  for my pains. 'Just so,' I said to myself, 'the soul and organs of the  discontented want keeping in subjection. I must be done with  discontent:--    'Golden gift, serene Contentment! have thou that, and all is had; Thrust  thy slipper on, and think thee that the earth is leather-clad.'    'All is known, digested, tested; nothing new is left to learn When the  soul, serene, reliant, Hope's delusive dreams can spurn.'    'And the sorry task of seeking favor is numbered in the miseries of  life--    'Hast thou never watched, a-waiting till the great man's door unbarred?  Didst thou never linger parting, saying many a last sad word? Spak'st  thou never word of folly, one light thing thou wouldst recall? Rare and  noble hath thy life been! fair thy fortune did befall!'    'No!' exclaimed I, 'I will do none of these; but, by retiring into the  quiet and untrodden forest, I will show my discernment of real good and  ill. The holy Books counsel it--    'True Religion!--'tis not blindly prating what the priest may prate, But  to love, as God hath loved them, all things, be they small or great; And  true bliss is when a sane mind doth a healthy body fill; And true  knowledge is the knowing what is good and what is ill.'    \"So came I to the forest, where, by good fortune and this good friend, I  met much kindness; and by the same good fortune have encountered you,  Sir, whose friendliness is as Heaven to me. Ah! Sir Tortoise,        'Poisonous though the tree of life be, two fair blossoms grow thereon:      One, the company of good men; and sweet songs of Poet's, one.'    \"King!\" said Slow-toes, \"your error was getting too much, without  giving. Give, says the sage--        'Give, and it shall swell thy getting; give, and thou shalt safer keep:      Pierce the tank-wall; or it yieldeth, when the water waxes deep.'    And he is very hard upon money-grubbing: as thus--        'When the miser hides his treasure in the earth, he doeth well;      For he opens up a passage that his soul may sink to hell,'      And thus--        'He whose coins are kept for counting, not to barter nor to give,      Breathe he like a blacksmith's bellows, yet in truth he doth not live.'    It hath been well written, indeed,        'Gifts, bestowed with words of kindness, making giving doubly dear:--      Wisdom, deep, complete, benignant, of all arrogancy clear;      Valor, never yet forgetful of sweet Mercy's pleading prayer;      Wealth, and scorn of wealth to spend it--oh! but these be virtues              rare!'    \"Frugal one may be,\" continued Slow-toes; \"but not a niggard like the  Jackal--        'The Jackal-knave, that starved his spirit so,      And died of saving, by a broken bow.'    \"Did he, indeed,\" said Golden-skin; \"and how was that?\"    \"I will tell you,\" answered Slow-toes:--      THE STORY OF THE DEAD GAME AND THE JACKAL    \"In a town called 'Well-to-Dwell' there lived a mighty hunter, whose  name was 'Grim-face,' Feeling a desire one day for a little venison, he  took his bow, and went into the woods; where he soon killed a deer. As  he was carrying the deer home, he came upon a wild boar of prodigious  proportions. Laying the deer upon the earth, he fixed and discharged an  arrow and struck the boar, which instantly rushed upon him with a roar  louder than the last thunder, and ripped the hunter up. He fell like a  tree cut by the axe, and lay dead along with the boar, and a snake also,  which had been crushed by the feet of the combatants. Not long  afterwards, there came that way, in his prowl for food, a Jackal, named  'Howl o' Nights,' and cast eyes on the hunter, the deer, the boar, and  the snake lying dead together. 'Aha!' said he, 'what luck! Here's a  grand dinner got ready for me! Good fortune can come, I see, as well as  ill fortune. Let me think:--the man will be fine pickings for a month;  the deer with the boar will last two more; the snake will do for  to-morrow; and, as I am very particularly hungry, I will treat myself  now to this bit of meat on the bow-horn,' So saying, he began to gnaw it  asunder, and the bow-string slipping, the bow sprang back, and resolved  Howl o' Nights into the five elements by death. That is my story,\"  continued Slow-toes, \"and its application is for the wise:--        'Sentences of studied wisdom, nought avail they unapplied;      Though the blind man hold a lantern, yet his footsteps stray aside.'    The secret of success, indeed, is a free, contented, and yet  enterprising mind. How say the books thereon?--        'Wouldst thou know whose happy dwelling Fortune entereth unknown?      His, who careless of her favor, standeth fearless in his own;      His, who for the vague to-morrow barters not the sure to-day--      Master of himself, and sternly steadfast to the rightful way:      Very mindful of past service, valiant, faithful, true of heart--      Unto such comes Lakshmi[9] smiling--comes, and will not lightly part.'    \"What indeed,\" continued Slow-toes, \"is wealth, that we should prize it,  or grieve to lose it?--        'Be not haughty, being wealthy; droop not, having lost thine all;      Fate doth play with mortal fortunes as a girl doth toss her ball.'    It is unstable by nature. We are told--        'Worldly friendships, fair but fleeting, shadows of the clouds at noon      Women, youth, new corn, and riches--these be pleasures passing soon.'    And it is idle to be anxious; the Master of Life knows how to sustain  it. Is it not written?--        'For thy bread be not o'er thoughtful--God for all hath taken thought:      When the babe is born, the sweet milk to the mother's breast is              brought.        He who gave the swan her silver, and the hawk her plumes of pride,      And his purples to the peacock--He will verily provide.'    \"Yes, verily,\" said Slow-toes, \"wealth is bad to handle, and better left  alone; there is no truer saying than this--        'Though for good ends, waste not on wealth a minute;      Mud may be wiped, but wise men plunge not in it.'    Hearing the wisdom of these monitions, Light o' Leap broke out, 'Good  Slow-toes! thou art a wise protector of those that come to thee; thy  learning comforts my enlightened friend, as elephants drag elephants  from the mire,' And thus, on the best of terms, wandering where they  pleased for food, the three lived there together.    One day it chanced that a Deer named Dapple-back, who had seen some  cause of alarm in the forest, came suddenly upon the three in his  flight. Thinking the danger imminent, Slow-toes dropped into the water,  King Golden-skin slipped into his hole, and Light o' Leap flew up into  the top of a high tree. Thence he looked all round to a great distance,  but could discover nothing. So they all came back again, and sat down  together. Slow-toes welcomed the Deer.    'Good Deer,' said he, 'may grass and water never fail thee at thy need.  Gratify us by residing here, and consider this forest thine own.'    'Indeed,' answered Dapple-back, 'I came hither for your protection,  flying from a hunter; and to live with you in friendship is my greatest  desire.'    'Then the thing is settled,' observed Golden-skin.    'Yes! yes!' said Light o' Leap, 'make yourself altogether at home!'    So the Deer, charmed at his reception, ate grass and drank water, and  laid himself down in the shade of a Banyan-tree to talk. Who does not  know?--        'Brunettes, and the Banyan's shadow,        Well-springs, and a brick-built wall.      Are all alike cool in the summer,        And warm in the winter--all.'    'What made thee alarmed, friend Deer?' began Slow-toes. 'Do hunters ever  come to this unfrequented forest?'    'I have heard,' replied Dapple-back, 'that the Prince of the Kalinga  country, Rukmangada, is coming here. He is even now encamped on the  Cheenab River, on his march to subjugate the borders; and the hunters  have been heard to say that he will halt to-morrow by this very lake of  \"Camphor-water.\" Don't you think, as it is dangerous to stay, that we  ought to resolve on something?'    'I shall certainly go to another pool,' exclaimed Slow-toes.    'It would be better,' answered the Crow and Deer together.    'Yes!' remarked the King of the Mice, after a minute's thought; 'but how  is Slow-toes to get across the country in time? Animals like our  amphibious host are best in the water; on land he might suffer from his  own design, like the merchant's son--        'The merchant's son laid plans for gains,      And saw his wife kissed for his pains.'    'How came that about?' asked all. \"I'll tell you,\" answered Golden-skin.      THE PRINCE AND THE WIFE OF THE MERCHANT'S SON    \"In the country of Kanouj there was a King named Virasena, and he made  his son viceroy of a city called Virapoora. The Prince was rich,  handsome, and in the bloom of youth. Passing through the streets of his  city one day, he observed a very lovely woman, whose name was  Lavanyavati--i.e., the Beautiful--the wife of a merchant's son. On  reaching his palace, full of her charms and of passionate admiration for  them, he despatched a message to her, and a letter, by a female  attendant:--who wonders at it?--        'Ah! the gleaming, glancing arrows of a lovely woman's eye!      Feathered with her jetty lashes, perilous they pass us by:--      Loosed at venture from the black bows of her arching brow they part,      All too penetrant and deadly for an undefended heart.'    Now Lavanyavati, from the moment she saw the Prince, was hit with the  same weapon of love that wounded him; but upon hearing the message of  the attendant, she refused with dignity to receive his"]]]
