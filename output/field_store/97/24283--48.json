The late learned Dr. Edward Williams has inserted it in his  valuable Appendix to the Christian Preacher: and the Rev. John Wesley made  a most copious extract from it, comprised in Vol. I. and II. of his  Christian Library.\"    § 33. And truly God did not design this great work solely for the comfort  and aid of the German nation during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), but  for all nations and all times. It has been translated into the Latin,  Danish, Swedish, Bohemian, Polish, Low Dutch, English, French, Turkish,  Russian, Malabar, Tamul, etc., languages. At least two editions of the  work in a Latin translation were published in England; the last appeared  in 1708, with the following title: \"Joannis Arndtii, Theologici, etc.: De  vero Christianismo. Libri IV. Cura et studio A. W. Boemi. Lond. 1708.\" 2  vols. 8vo.--Another Latin edition was published in Germany in 1624. The  Tamul translation had the following Latin title: \"De vero Christianismo,  in Tamulicum convertit Benjamin Schulzius, Missionarius Evangelicus.\"(2)    § 34. The work had made so deep an impression on learned British  Christians, who read it in Latin, that the wish was repeatedly and  earnestly expressed that it might be made accessible to English readers.  At this period, that is, during the reign of Queen Anne of England (who  died in 1714), large numbers of German emigrants from the Palatinate  passed through England on their way to the provinces of New York and  Pennsylvania. The Rev. Anthony William Boehm, a German Lutheran clergyman,  had previously been appointed as the court chaplain of Prince George of  Denmark, the consort of Queen Anne. His enlightened zeal and devout heart  led him to take a deep interest, not only in the temporal, but also in the  spiritual welfare of these pilgrims, who were on their way to the wilds of  North America. He accordingly supplied them, by the aid of certain  like-minded friends, with German Bibles and Hymn Books, and also with  German copies of Arndt's \"True Christianity,\" as well as with other books  of devotion. This interesting fact is mentioned in the letters of Dr.  Muhlenberg, published in the well-known _Halle Reports_ (_Hallische  Nachrichten_, pp. 665, 793). But Mr. Boehm also resolved to furnish the  people, in the midst of whom he lived, with the great work of his favorite  author, in their own language, and accordingly prepared an English  translation, which was first printed in London in 1712.    § 35. It would be unjust to the memory of this excellent man, if we should  fail to refer to his literary labors. His high office at the royal court  of England, is an evidence of his personal merit. He was not only a devout  and faithful preacher of the Gospel, but also an author who acquired  distinction. In 1734 he published a very valuable work in the German  language, entitled: \"Eight Books, on the Reformation of the Church in  England, extending from the year 1526, under Henry VIII., to the reign of  Charles II.\" In a very beautiful eulogy, in manuscript, found in the  volume before us, the writer refers to the successful efforts of Mr. Boehm  to provide for the education of the children of the poor in his vicinity.  He died May 27, 1722, in his fiftieth year, after having faithfully  labored in the service of Christ. He sustained, with eminent success, the  Danish Lutheran missionaries in Tranquebar, by sending pecuniary aid  obtained in London, as well as religious publications. Besides his great  German historical work, which is the complement of Burnet's \"History of  the Reformation of the Church of England,\" he also published several  English compositions, such as a \"Sermon on the doctrine of Original Sin,  Eph. 4:22,\" printed in London, 1711, and a \"Sermon on the Duty of the  Reformation (Jubilee), Rev. 18:4,\" London, 1718, besides various religious  works in the German language.    § 36. About the beginning of the present century, the Rev. Calvin  Chaddock, who resided in Hanover, Massachusetts, obtained a copy of Mr.  Boehm's translation, \"accidentally,\" as he says, and found it to be so  valuable, that he resolved to issue an American edition, which accordingly  appeared in 1809, Boston. In his short Preface he remarks, with great  truth, that the language of the translation \"appears to be somewhat  ancient, and the sentiments in some few instances obscure.\" He adds, in  reference to his own agency: \"The only alterations which have been made,  are such as respect redundant and obsolete words, orthography, the  addition of some words, and the transposition of some sentences; that the  ideas of the translator might appear more conspicuous.\" He might have,  with great advantage, been even more liberal than he was, in correcting  the style; it still remained in numerous passages heavy and obscure. As  the style, even of the original German, is somewhat antiquated, and as,  besides, occasional obscurities and repetitions occur, a later successor  in one of Arndt's pastoral charges, the Rev. J. F. Fedderson, assumed the  task of revising and abridging the whole of the original German, improving  or modernizing the style, and occasionally adding new matter. The result  of his labors does not appear to have received the entire approbation of  the German religious world; the original and unaltered work continues so  popular, that no permanent place has been secured for the substitute. A  portion of Fedderson's production was translated and published in  Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, in 1834, by the Rev. John N. Hoffman, Pastor  of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation of that place. The translation  was never completed. The part which was given, consisting mainly of Book  I., has long since been out of print.    § 37. In the year 1815, a new edition of Mr. Boehm's English translation  was issued in London (evidently without any reference to Mr. Chaddock's  American edition), by William Jacques, A.M., who had already distinguished  himself by his translation, from the Latin, of A. H. Francke's \"Guide to  the Reading and Study of the Holy Scriptures,\" of which a reprint, in a  very unattractive form, and with omissions, appeared in Philadelphia, in  1823. He took Mr. Boehm's translation as the \"ground-work,\" which, as he  states in his Preface, he did not \"edit either hastily or negligently.  There is not a single page, nor a single paragraph,\" he continues, \"which  has not been subjected to scrutiny,\" etc. Nevertheless, Mr. Jacques, who  does not appear to have compared the translation with the original German,  made only verbal changes, which, as it is evident, materially improve the  style. But he allowed all the additions of Mr. Boehm, which are generally  quite tautological, and various inaccuracies in thought and expression to  remain. So many antiquated expressions were retained, that it would have  been inexpedient to reprint the work precisely as Mr. Jacques allowed the  text to remain. Besides, he curtailed the full titles of the several  chapters, and, with very few exceptions, omitted the important and  appropriate texts which Arndt had prefixed respectively to the latter.  These circumstances, in connection with others, such as numerous  typographical errors, especially in the Scripture references, plainly  indicated that a revision of the whole was necessary, before the present  edition could be presented to the public.    § 38. The editor of the present American edition took that of Mr. Jacques  as the basis of the translation, but compared every sentence with the  original German. He found some cases in which valuable matter had been  omitted, and was occasionally required to supply sentences that had been  mutilated or suppressed. But he erased all the verbal additions, and the  clauses, or sentences, inserted by Mr. Boehm, where it seemed to have been  the object of the latter only to explain remarks that were already  perfectly lucid, or to add emphasis by the insertion of adjectives, etc.,  or else to impart beauty by the adoption of poetical terms or phrases,  which were inconsistent with the severe simplicity of Arndt's style. He  even represents the author, on one occasion, as quoting from the  \"Homilies\" of the Church of England, which Arndt undoubtedly never read,  and certainly does not mention in the original. The American editor has,  also, at the request of several friends, who took an interest in securing  the publication of the present edition, prepared a somewhat copious INDEX.  One of the Latin editions (London, 1708) contains an index, adapted only  to its own pages. Another, in German, is found in some of the German  editions, for instance, in that of Nuremberg, 1762, also adapted to the  pages of the particular edition only. As the American editor found none in  English, and preferred to adapt the new Index, prepared by him, to the  work itself (specifying the Book, Chapter, and Section), he accordingly  completed his task on this plan, after a considerable expenditure of time  and labor. It is somewhat difficult to prepare an Index for a work which  is so exclusively devotional in its character as the present, and in which  the author does not intend to discuss subjects in a strictly scientific  manner. Arndt, for instance, employs terms which, when defined with  precision, indicate different shades of thought, almost as if they were  synonymous (_e. g._, the _grace_, _mercy_, _goodness_, _love_, etc., of  God), and often repeats the same thought in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34781"],[0,"An Australian Bird Book: A Pocket Book for Field Use (#8)"],[1," disappears in the hollow  between the waves, and catch him again as he rises over the crest; but  how he rises, and whence comes the propelling force, are to the  eye inexplicable; he alters merely the angle at which the wings are  inclined....\"    Gould considered that many of these birds circumnavigate the globe  many times. They follow ships for days together.    Albatrosses are sometimes caught by those on board ship. One means  of protection employed by these birds is to discharge a considerable  quantity of oily matter at an intruder. This has led sailors to  declare that the bird is \"seasick.\" Some claim that this is not done  for protection, but is due to fright.    The members of the Australasian Ornithologists' Union, when on a trip  in the _Manawatu_ to the Bass Strait Islands found it tantalizing  to see the beautiful Shy Albatrosses sitting on their nests on the  precipitous granite Albatross Rock, and be unable to land owing to the  rough sea that was running. We waited a second and a third day, in the  shelter of Chimney Corner, Three Hummocks Island, but finally had to  depart with but a distant acquaintance with this fine bird. When they  return to nest the succeeding year, the parents drive last year's  brood off the island. Does the young live on its fat all through the  cold, rough winter, or do the parents return at intervals to feed it?  Some recent records by a French party on one of these lonely nesting  islands show that in some cases, at least, the parents do feed the  young at night during their long wait. The sitting bird is fed by  her mate. He opens his mouth, and she inserts her bill, and chooses a  dainty for herself.    _A Monograph of the Petrels_, by F. Du Cane Godman, F.R.S., Pres.
