They said dat they was treated mighty good by deir marster  all de time they was slaves. My daddy took his old marster's name. I was  born a slave but all I knows is what I has heard. Some of it might be  right and some might be wrong.\"          Rev. James H. Johnson          *Interview with James H. Johnson, 82 years old*      --_Stiles M. Scruggs, Columbia, S.C._    \"My name is James H. Johnson. I was born December 20, 1855, at the town  servants' quarters of Alfred Brevort at Camden, South Carolina, and that  was home until I was turning into twelve years of age. I was nearly ten  years old, when the army of General Sherman came to Camden. I talked to  some of the soldiers, soon after they arrived.\"    Such was the greeting of the Rev. James H. Johnson; a retired, and well  educated Methodist Episcopal minister, when a WPA reporter called at his  residence, 2029 Marion Street, Columbia, South Carolina, and asked for  an interview. He sat in his study, furnished for comfort and equipped  about as well as any study, of this kind, in Columbia.    \"My mother,\" he explained, \"was one of the maids at the Brevort home,  and my father was one of the overseers of the plantation. We did not  hear about President Lincoln's freedom proclamation in 1863, but the  status quo of slavery kept right on as it had been until Sherman's army  came through. You know General Lee surrendered the same spring, and we  learned we were free.    \"In 1866 my father bought four acres in the vicinity of Camden and  improved it with a house and barn, and we lived there for several years.  My father went into the mercantile business in Camden and prospered.  There I went to the public schools. We had teachers from the North, and  I finished all the grades. There were no high schools in the state at  that time.    \"We had our own home-raised hams and plenty of food products in our  quarters, when my mother and I heard shooting nearby. We stepped into  the yard and saw a big number of soldiers shooting at a running white  man of the community. They did not hit him. In a moment or two five  soldiers strode into our yard and we were scared at first, but they told  us they were friends, and one of them spied the hams and asked if they  belonged to the big house. When told that they were ours, they said they  were hungry, and mother fixed them a dinner of ham and eggs and plenty  of other things. They thanked us and left, doing no harm.    \"Before they left, I noticed a crowd of soldiers at the Brevort home. I  ran there, and told the troops, please, to do no damage to the premises,  as the mistress, then in charge, was the best friend my mother and I had  ever had. They left soon afterward, showing no animus toward the Brevort  family and taking nothing away.    \"We never received any aid from the Freedmen's bureau, for we did not  need it. After I finished the public school work at Camden and helped my  father in his store for a time, I entered the University of South  Carolina, in October, 1874 and stayed there until 1877. You know there  was a change in government in 1876, and Negroes were excluded from the  university in 1877. I was in my junior year, when I left.    \"I returned to Camden and taught school in Kershaw County for ten years.  During that time I opened school in the Browning Home, which still  stands in Camden. In the meantime, I had been an interested member of  the Methodist Episcopal Church since my early years, and I was made an  elder in that denomination in 1888, and sent to Columbia as pastor of  the Wesley Methodist Church.    \"When I came here as pastor, that church stood on the corner of Sumter  and Gervais streets, on the site where the United States post-office now  stands. The congregation sold that corner in 1910 and built the brick  church at Barnwell and Gervais streets. I was the pastor all that time,  retiring in 1930 due to physical feebleness. The congregation of that  church has always been rather small. This accounts for my doing other  work. I was a clerk in the internal revenue office in Columbia for  eighteen years.    \"Now, I am a notary public and make some income from that. The church  gives me a small pension, and I advise and do literary work for a large  number of Negro residents. In that way, I keep fairly busy and my family  has never gone hungry. I did preach some, a few years ago. I am now too  feeble to undertake that task, and have to be content, mostly at home.\"    (Reporter's Note: The Rev. James H. Johnson speaks no dialect. He speaks  choice, grammatical diction and has a most pleasing personality. His is  one of the very few Methodist Episcopal Churches in South Carolina for  Negroes. He says he is glad the church is now seeking to void the split  over slavery in 1860. He resides in a comfortable home at 2029 Marion  Street, Columbia, S.C.)          Jane Johnson          *Interview with Jane Johnson, 90 years old*      --_Henry Grant, Columbia, S.C._    Jane Johnson is living with her niece at 1430 Harden Street, Columbia,  S.C. She is of small statue, dark, not black, plump and apparently well  cared for. On account of her age and bodily afflictions she is incapable  of self-support. Her niece is unmarried, owns a comfortable home, works  and provides for her grandmother in a good and satisfactory manner.    \"Come in, white folks, take dat chair and set down. I hears dat you  wants to talk to me 'bout myself and my master in slavery time. My name  is Jane Johnson and I's 'bout ninety years old, from de best 'membrance  I has from my white folks friends and my own people. One thing I does  know, I's been here so long, dat I sometimes think I's near 'bout a  hundred years old.    \"I b'long to Master Tom Robertson. My mistress' name was Ophelia. I  didn't see her much in slavery time, 'cause she stayed in de big house  on Arsenal Hill, Columbia, S.C. De onliest time I see her a-tall, was  when I was sent to de big house for somethin' and dat wasn't often.  Master and mistress had heaps of chillun, 'mong them was twins, all dead  now, if I 'members right, 'cept Master Tom Robertson, a grandson and a  rich man too; he living right here in Columbia. My old master lived in  Columbia but his plantation, where us slaves lived, was 'bout four or  five miles from Columbia on de Sumter road, just beyond de soldiers  hospital (Veterans Hospital), dat's right.    \"Master Tom come to de plantation every day 'cept Sundays and sometimes  he come dat day, 'specially in crop season. He never talked to us slaves  much, just talked to de overseer 'bout us all, I reckon. De overseer was  a nigger and de meanest man, white or black, I ever see. Dat nigger  would strut 'round wid a leather strap on his shoulder and would whip de  other slaves unmerciful. He worked us hard from sunrise to sunset every  day in de week, 'cept some Saturday evenin's. 'Most of de grown slave  women knocked off from field work at dinner time on Saturdays and done  de washin' for de rest of de slaves.    \"Yes sir, us had a plenty of rations to eat; no fancy vittles, just  plain corn bread, meat and vegetables. Dere was no flour bread or any  kind of sweet stuff for de slaves to eat. Master say sweet things  'fected de stomach and teeth in a bad way. He wanted us to stay well and  healthy so us could work hard.    \"Master Tom was good to us, course he was, 'cause he didn't see us much  no way. But dat nigger overseer was de devil settin' cross-legged for de  rest of us on de plantation all de time. I never has believed dat master  'tended for dat nigger to treat us like he did. He took 'vantage of his  bein' 'way and talk soft talk when he come again. Yes sir, he sho' did.    \"Not very long after de Yankees come, us was told dat de niggers was  free. You might think dat was a happy day for us slaves, but I didn't  think lak dat. I was kinda lonesome and sad lak. Us slaves was lost,  didn't know what to do or where to go. Don't you think dat was a sad  time?    \"How old was I when I done my courtin'? What's dat? Dat courtin' stuff  is what white folks does, no nigger knows what dat fancy thing is. Us  just natchally lives together; men and women mates lak de animals out  dere. Colored people don't pay no 'tention to what white folks call  love, they just 'sires de woman they wants, dat's all. I married dat man  of mine, Tilghman Thompson, and us got 'long right smart, 'til he die. I  got 'nother one, Anderson Johnson, and he die too, so here I is, left  here yit.    \"You knows de black man has had a long, hard road to travel since he was  first brought to this country. From de first, he b'long to de white man  to be took care of and to work. Some colored folks 'pear to be doin'  right well dese days but back yonder long befo' I was born, I's been  told, they didn't know how to provide for themselves. What I wants to  know, what de nigger gwine to do widout de 'sistance of de white man?  What they has got come from them, you knows dat. I hear some of them  growlin' 'round, dat they is gwine to do dis and gwine do dat and they  don't do nothin', 'cept talk too much. They sho' better do right; live  in peace and git somethin' dat will stay with them.    \"Maybe I's wrong to say dis but you knows, white man, de nigger is a far  way back of de white man; his time ain't come yit, leastwise dat's de  way it 'pear to me. De nigger come from Africa and other hot places, so  he takes after de hot country he come from and has a short temper, hard  head, and not 'nough sense to keep him out of trouble when he gits mad  or 'cited. When he come here, de white man made him work, and he didn't  like dat. He is natchally lazy and when he had to work, then he began to  get huffy and to conjure up in he mind hate and other bad things against  de whites.

Had animals in groups B and C also  minimized their thermal conductances, while retaining their measured  metabolic rates, their rates of heat production would have been  disproportionately higher than their rates of heat loss. Equation 4  predicts that under these conditions their body temperatures would  have been elevated to 42.0 deg.C and 40.4 deg.C, respectively. Thus, in order  to avoid such a large increase in body temperature, animals in groups  B and C increased their thermal conductances in preference to lowering  their metabolic rates. The regression equation of thermoregulatory  metabolism for all winter animals (Table 5), therefore, overestimates  minimum metabolic cost of temperature regulation below T_{lc}, and its  slope underestimates C_{mw}. Consequently, the best estimate of C_{mw}  for _Procyon lotor_ in winter is the value calculated for group A  animals with Eq. 4 (0.0172 mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1}. deg.C^{-1}; Table 3),  and the minimum cost of thermoregulatory metabolism at any T_{a} below  T_{lc} is best estimated by substituting this value into Eq. 4 and  solving for [.H]_{r}.        THERMOREGULATION AT HIGH TEMPERATURES      _Body Temperature_    In both summer and winter, T_{b}'s increased during metabolic  measurements at T_{a}'s above T_{lc} (Figure 6). This response also  was seen during metabolic measurements conducted on other procyonids  (Mueller and Kulzer, 1977; Chevillard-Hugot et al., 1980; Mueller and  Rost, 1983; Chevalier, 1985).      _Summer_    During summer our data suggested that the upper critical temperature  (T_{uc}) was higher than 35 deg.C. The lowest rates of oxygen consumption  at T_{a} = 35 deg.C occurred after 1.5 to 2.5 hours of exposure to that  temperature. Prolonged exposure to this temperature in summer did not  make animals restless, and their rate of oxygen consumption was very  stable throughout each measurement. Body temperature responses at  T_{a} = 35 deg.C were recorded from two males and two females that had  implanted radio transmitters. With the exception of one male, T_{b}'s  were maintained near 38 deg.C (Figure 6). The one exception (a male)  maintained its T_{b} at 39.3 deg.C. At T_{a} = 35 deg.C, summer males had  rates of evaporative water loss that were lower than those of summer  females (Figure 4). At this temperature, males dissipated 35% +-6% and  females 56% +-18% of their metabolic heat via evaporative water loss.  Thus, at T_{a} = 35 deg.C, males must have utilized modes of heat transfer  other than evaporative cooling (convective and conductive heat  transfer) to a greater extent than females.      _Winter_    Body temperature, evaporative water loss, and metabolic data indicated  that, in winter, T_{uc} was very close to 35 deg.C. In winter, the lowest  level of oxygen consumption was recorded during the first hour after  the chamber had reached T_{a} = 35 deg.C. Unlike summer, animals became  restless after the first hour at 35 deg.C, at which point their oxygen  consumption increased and showed a high degree of variability. Body  temperature responses at 35 deg.C were recorded from both females that had  implanted radio transmitters. In one case, T_{b} rose from 37.9 deg.C at  the end of the first hour to 40.5 deg.C by the end of the second hour, and  as it did not show signs of leveling off, we terminated the  experiment. We exposed that same animal to T_{a} = 35 deg.C one other time  during winter. In that instance, its T_{b} rose to 40.0 deg.C during the  first 30 minutes and was maintained at that level for three hours with  no apparent distress. The other female elevated its T_{b} from 37.3 deg.C  to 39.0 deg.C during the second hour at T_{a} = 35 deg.C and maintained its  T_{b} at that level for two hours. Thus, during winter, prolonged  exposure to T_{a} = 35 deg.C stimulated more of an increase in T_{b} than  it did in summer. During winter, both males and females increased  evaporative water loss at T_{a} = 35 deg.C (Figure 5) but only to the  extent that they dissipated 35% +-10% of their metabolic heat  production. Thus, even in winter, convective and conductive heat  transfers were still the most important modes of heat loss at this  temperature.        DAILY CYCLE OF BODY TEMPERATURE      The daily cycle of raccoon T_{b}'s during summer and winter are  presented in Figure 7. In general, T_{b}'s showed a marked circadian  cycle in phase with photoperiod. T_{b}'s rose above 38 deg.C for several  hours each night but remained below 38 deg.C during daytime. During  summer, with the exception of one female whose record was not typical  (Figure 7), T_{b}'s rose above 38 deg.C shortly after sunset, whereas in  winter T_{b}'s did not rise above 38 deg.C until several hours after  sunset. Once T_{b} was elevated it usually remained so until just  before or after sunrise (Figure 7). During summer, T_{b} was above  38 deg.C for 85% or more of the time between sunset and sunrise (87% for  the female with the typical body temperature pattern, and 85% and 98%  for males), whereas in winter it was elevated for only 47%-78% of the  time between sunset and sunrise (47% and 61% for females, and 67% and  78% for males). During night, T_{b} would oscillate between 38 deg.C and  about 39 deg.C, such that two peak values occurred. These peak values  presumably corresponded to two periods of heightened nighttime  activity. During summer, one of these peaks occurred before and the  other after 24:00 hours, whereas in winter both peaks occurred after  24:00 hours. With the exception of one female in winter (Figure 7),  the lowest T_{b} of the day for both sexes was near 37 deg.C, and this  typically occurred during daytime (Figure 7).          $Discussion$        BASAL METABOLIC RATE      _Background_    Basal metabolism represents the minimum energy required by a mammal to  maintain endothermy and basic homeostasis (Lusk, 1917:141; Kleiber,  1932, 1961:251; Benedict, 1938:191-215; Brody, 1945:59; Robbins,  1983:105-111). Mammals with lower than predicted [.H]_{b} maintain  endothermy and enjoy its attendant advantages at a discount, whereas  others, with rates that are higher than predicted, pay a premium  (Calder, 1987). Such variation in [.H]_{b} appears to be tied to  ecological circumstances rather than taxonomic affinities (Vogel,  1980; McNab, 1986a, 1988a, 1989), and depending on environmental  conditions, each rate provides an individual with various advantages  and limitations. During the course of evolution, therefore, each  species' [.H]_{b} evolves to provide it with the best match between  its energy requirements for continuous endothermy, its food supply,  and the thermal characteristics of its environment.      _Captive versus Wild Raccoons_    Male raccoons trapped in summer had higher [.H]_{b}'s than our captive  animals in any season (Table 2). The higher rate of metabolism of  these trapped males could have been due to the stress of captivity or  to the fact that \"wild\" animals actually may have higher metabolic  rates than those that have adjusted to captivity. If the latter is  true, then our data for captive animals underestimated the actual  energy cost of maintenance metabolism for _Procyon lotor_ in the wild.  At present, we have no way of determining which of these alternatives  is true.      _Seasonal Metabolism of Raccoons_    In some temperate-zone mammals, [.H]_{b} is elevated in winter, which  presumably increases their \"cold-hardiness.\" Conversely, lower summer  metabolism is considered to be a mechanism that reduces the potential  for heat stress. Such seasonal variation in [.H]_{b} has been found in  several species: collard peccary, _Tayassu tajacu_ (Zervanos, 1975);  antelope jackrabbit, _Lepus alleni_ (Hinds, 1977); desert cottontail,  _Sylvilagus audubonii_ (Hinds, 1973); and, perhaps, cold-acclimatized  rat, _Rattus norvegicus_ (Hart and Heroux, 1963). Unlike these  species, our captive raccoons showed no seasonal variation in [.H]_{b}  (Table 2). Instead, raccoons achieved \"cold-hardiness\" in winter and  reduced their potential for heat stress in summer with a large  seasonal change in thermal conductance (Table 3).
