No correlation between the weight of the individual  newborn vole and the number of voles per litter was observed.    Although the ratio of the average weight of newborn voles to the average  weight of an adult female was approximately equal for _M.  pennsylvanicus_ and _M. ochrogaster_, the ratio of the weight of a  litter to the average weight of an adult female was larger in the  eastern meadow vole because the mean litter size was larger. Perhaps  this is related to the more productive habitat in which the eastern  meadow vole is ordinarily found.      Size, Growth Rates and Life Spans    The mean weight of adult voles during the period of study was 43.78  grams. The females averaged slightly heavier than the males but the  overlapping of weights was so extensive that sexual difference in weight  could not be affirmed. The difference observed was less in December and  January when gravid females were rare, suggesting that the difference  was due, at least in part, to pregnancy. Jameson (1947:128) found, for a  sample of 50 voles, a mean weight of 44 grams and a range of 38 to 58  grams. The range in the adult voles I studied was much greater, from 25  to 73 grams. In part, this increase in the range of adult weights was  due to a much larger sample.    [Illustration: FIG. 11. Relationship between rainfall and the mean  weight of adult males in summer. The abnormally low rainfall in the  summer of 1952 was accompanied by a decrease in mean weight. The solid  line represents mean weight and the broken line rainfall. The  correlation coefficient between the two was 0.68.]    During the unusually dry summer of 1952, a notable reduction in the mean  weight of adults was recorded (Fig. 11). The correlation coefficient  between the mean weight of adults and the amount of rainfall for the  summer months was 0.68. It seems reasonable to attribute the drop in  mean weight to an alteration of plant growth due to decreased rainfall.  Some of the reduction in mean weight was due to the loss of weight in  older individuals but most of it was due to the failure of voles born in  the spring to continue growing.    No data on the growth rate of _M. ochrogaster_ were found in the  literature. According to the somewhat scanty data from my study, secured  from observations of individuals born in the laboratory, young voles  gained approximately 0.6 of a gram per day for the first ten days,  approximately one gram per day up to an age of one month, and  approximately 0.5 of a gram per day from an age of one month until  growth ceases. This growth rate was especially variable after the voles  reached an age of thirty days. The growth rate approximates those  described for _M. pennsylvanicus_ (Hamilton, 1941:12) and for _M.  californicus_ (Hatfield, 1935:269; Selle, 1928:97). Although the data  were inadequate for a definite statement, I gained the impression that  there was no difference between the sexes in growth rate. In general,  young voles grow most rapidly in the April-May-June period and least  rapidly in mid-winter. Several voles, born in late autumn, stopped  growing while still far short of adult size and lived through the winter  without gaining weight, then gained as much as 30 per cent after spring  arrived (Fig. 12).    [Illustration: FIG. 12. Growth rates of two voles selected to show  typical growth pattern of voles born late in the year. Growth nearly  stops in winter and is resumed in spring.]    The recorded life spans of most voles studied were less than one year.  No accurate mean life span could be determined. Leslie and Ransom  (1940:46), Hamilton (1937a:506) and Fisher (1945:436) also found that  most voles lived less than one year. Leslie and Ransom (_op. cit._: 47)  reported a mean life span of 237.59 +- 10.884 days in voles of a  laboratory population. In the present study one female was trapped 624  days after first being captured; another female was trapped 617 days  after first being captured; and a male was trapped 611 days after first  being captured. The two females were subadults when first captured. The  male was already an adult when first captured; consequently its life  span must have exceeded 650 days. No evidence of any decrease in vigor  or fertility was observed to accompany old age.    Of the 45 marked voles snap-trapped in August of 1952, 21 had been  captured first as juveniles. The ages of these voles could be estimated  within a few days, and the series presented a unique opportunity for  studying individual and age variation. Only individuals weighing less  than 18 grams when first captured were used, and their ages were  estimated according to the growth rate described above. Howell (1924)  reported an analysis of individual and age variation in a series of  specimens of _Microtus montanus_, and Hall (1926) studied the changes  due to growth in skulls of _Otospermophilus grammarus beecheyi_. The  series of specimens described here differs from those of Hall and  Howell, and from any other collection known to me, in the fact that the  specimens are of approximately known age and drawn from a wild  population.    Unfortunately, this sample was small, and the distribution of the  specimens among age groups left much to be desired. No specimens less  than one and one-half months old were taken and only a few individuals  older than four and one-half months. Table 3 shows the age distribution.  The small size of the sample and the absence of juveniles were due,  partly, to the unusually dry weather in the summer of 1952. The  reduction in the rate of reproduction, caused by drought (as described  elsewhere in this paper), reduced the populations and the percentage of  juveniles to low levels.      TABLE 3. DISTRIBUTION AMONG AGE GROUPS OF 21 VOLES USED IN THE STUDY OF    VARIATION DUE TO AGE      ======================================================================    Age in months       1-1/2   2   2-1/2   3   3-1/2   4   4-1/2   6   12    ----------------------------------------------------------------------    No. of individuals   1      4    5      1    3      2    3      1    1    ----------------------------------------------------------------------    In the series of voles studied, ten individuals were in the process of  molting from subadult to adult pelage. Jameson (1947:131) reported the  molt to occur between eight and 12 weeks of age and selected 38 grams as  the lower limit of weight of adults. I also found all voles molting to  be between eight and 12 weeks old but found none so large as 38 grams  without full adult pelage. This may have been, in part, due to the dry  weather delaying or inhibiting growth. Because of the small size of the  sample and the influence of the unusual weather conditions, no  conclusions concerning normal molting were drawn from the data described  below. They are presented only as a description of a small sample drawn  from a single population at one time. Table 4 summarizes these data.      TABLE 4. MEAN SIZES AND AGES OF VOLES MOLTING FROM SUBADULT TO ADULT    PELAGE      =====================================================================                                Body length   Condylo-basilar                    Weight       minus tail      length         Age    ---------------------------------------------------------------------    Six males      32.67 gms.   106.16 mm.     23.78 mm.        9.67 wks.                    (30-36)      (96-116)       (23.2-24.4)    (8-12)    Four females    29.0 gms.   100.25 mm.     23.45 mm.        10.5 wks.                    (28-30)      (98-102)       (23.5-23.8)    (8-12)    Ten voles       31.2 gms.   103.8 mm.      23.73 mm.        10.0 wks.                    (28-36)      (96-116)       (23.2-24.4)    (8-12)    ---------------------------------------------------------------------    The mean age of the ten voles molting was ten weeks (8-12). Six males  averaged 9.67 weeks, almost a week younger than four females, who  averaged 10.5 weeks. The difference in age at time of molting between  the sexes was not significant. Differences between the sexes in other  characteristics to be described also lacked significance. Mean weights  at the time of molting were: males, 32.67 gms. (30-36); females, 29.0  gms. (28-30); and all individuals, 31.2 gms. (28-36). Because a piece of  the tail of each vole had been removed in marking, the total length of  the voles could not be determined. Body length, excluding tail, was  used. Howell (1924:986) found this measurement subject to less  individual variation than total length and thought body length was  probably a better indicator of age. Mean body length at the time of  molting was 103.8 mm. (96-116). Males averaged longer than females and  were also more variable. The mean body length of males was 106.16 mm.  (96-116) and that of females was 100.25 mm. (98-102).    Of the subadults showing no signs of molting, none was above the mean  age of molting. Twenty-five per cent of them were longer and heavier  than the mean length and weight of those that were molting. Of the 20  adults in the series, one was below the mean weight of molting and one  was shorter than the mean length of molting.    When Howell (_op. cit._:1014) studied skulls of _Microtus montanus_ he  found that the condylobasilar length was the most satisfactory means for  arranging his series of specimens according to their age. When the  skulls of my series were arranged according to their age (as determined  from trapping records) the graph of the condylobasilar lengths showed a  clear, though not perfect, relationship to age (Fig. 13). No separation  of sexes was made because the sample did not permit it. In Fig. 13  graphs of weight, as determined in the field, and of length (excluding  tail) also were included because they are the most easily measured  characters of live voles.

The poor mules were very tired by the end of the march  and one had died of colic on the way. Most of the others too were  getting very sore backs from the constant rain. On the way Wollaston and  I stopped at Rhenock to have a look at the Chandra Nursery kept by Tulsi  Dass, where there were many interesting plants, chiefly collected in the  Sikkim forests. There was a tree growing everywhere in the forests with  a white flower which Sikkim people called Chilauni, and all along the  paths the Sikkim durbar had been busy planting mulberry, walnut and toon  trees. There was a curious pink ground plant that grew in the forests  which I was told belonged to the Amomum species. There were also  beautiful orchids in the trees, mauve, white and yellow, belonging to  the Dendrobium, Coelogene and Cymbidium families--some with fine sprays  of flowers 18 inches long. Here at Rongli the mules were so tired that  we had to give them a day's rest before they could go on any further. It  was a hot and feverish spot to stop in, and only necessity compelled us  to do so, as we were unable to get any extra transport the following  morning to supplement the mules that were sick.    All that day we had passed numbers of mules coming down from Tibet laden  with bales of wool, and others were returning to Tibet with sheets of  copper, manufactured goods, grain and rice which had been bought in  exchange. The dark faces of the muleteers with their turquoise earrings  formed a pretty picture and they were full of friendly smiles and  greetings for us. The mules travelled on their own--if any mule stopped  on the path, a stone always aimed with the greatest accuracy reminded  him that it was time to go on. Owing to our having to halt a day at  Rongli, we had to stop the second party, and were able to do this at  Ari, a bungalow 3 miles short of Rongli. I rode up to see how they were  getting on, and found they were having the same trouble with their mules  that we had been having. On May 23 we left for Sedongchen, or Padamchen  as the Tibetans called it. Sedongchen is the old local name, so-called  because there once grew there a very large \"Sedong\" tree. This is a tree  that has a white sap which irritates the skin intensely and sets up a  rash. Sedongchen was only 9 miles from Rongli, but there was a very  steep climb, from 2,700 feet up to 7,000 feet, and our mules only just  managed to arrive there. The first part of the way is alongside the  rushing stream of the Rongli, through lovely woods and dense tropical  vegetation. Caladiums, kolocasias and begonias were growing on every  rock, and the giant pothos with its large shining leaves grew up the  stems of many of the trees. Climbers of all kinds, such as vines and  peppers, hung down from the branches. Here, too, were magnificent forest  trees, fully 150 feet high, with clean straight trunks and without a  branch for a hundred feet; others nearly equally tall, which the Sikkim  people call \"Panisage,\" had huge buttresses and trunks nearly 40 feet in  circumference. Every branch here was covered by thick matted growth of  orchids. For the first time since leaving Darjeeling the sun shone, and  after we left the forests we found the uphill climb very hot. On  to-day's march, out of the fifty mules with which we started there were  only fourteen carrying our own kit, and of those fourteen we found on  arrival at Sedongchen that none would be fit to proceed on the following  day. It was therefore with great reluctance that I felt compelled to  send back the Government mules, as they could not only not carry their  own line gear, but had become an extra and very large source of expense  and worry to us. That the mules should have completely broken down like  this after a five days' march showed that they must have been in no kind  of training and condition and were completely unfitted for heavy work in  the mountains. The hill ponies and mules that we had hired to supplement  them, although they had been given the heaviest loads, always arrived  first, and made nothing of each march. By this failure of the Government  transport we were now thrown back on our own resources, and obliged to  depend everywhere on what local transport we could obtain, and this  often took some time to collect.    At Sedongchen there was a pleasant bungalow, rather Swiss in appearance,  with fine views down the Rongli Valley and across all the forest ridges  over which we had come, right back to Darjeeling. Opposite us, to the  South-east, were densely wooded hills with clouds and mists drifting  along the tops, while here and there a waterfall showed up white amidst  the dark green vegetation.    Rain came down steadily all night, but the morning proved somewhat  finer. Being on the main trade route, we were luckily able to get other  transport to replace the Government mules and to arrange for hired mules  as far as Yatung. The local animal is a wonderful beast, extremely sure  footed, and not minding in the least a climb of 6,000 feet. The path  from Sedongchen is really only a stone causeway, very slippery and  unpleasant either to walk or ride upon, but probably anything else would  be worn away by the torrential rains that fall here. At one place we had  to make a wide detour, as the rain of the night before had washed away  some hundred yards of the pathway, but luckily this was not in a very  steep part, as otherwise we might have been delayed for several days.  The constant rain had already brought out the leeches, and on most of  the stones or blades of grass beside the path they sat waiting for  their meal of blood and clung on to any mule or human being that passed  by. The mules suffered severely, and drops of blood on the stones became  frequent from the bleeding wounds.    The climb from Sedongchen to Gnatong was very steep with a rise of over  5,000 feet in the first 5 miles, and we soon got out of the zone of the  leeches and on to the most wonderful zone of flowering rhododendrons.  The rhododendrons in the lower forest chiefly consisted of _R.  Argenteum_ and _R. Falconeri_. These grew in a great forest of oaks and  magnolias, all covered with beautiful ferns among which showed up  delightful mauve or white orchids. The lower rhododendrons had already  flowered, but as we got higher we found masses of _R. Cinnabarinum_,  with flowers showing every shade of orange and red. Then came  rhododendrons of every colour--pink, deep crimson, yellow, mauve, white  or cream coloured. It was impossible to imagine anything more beautiful,  and every yard of the path was a pure delight. Among the smaller flowers  were the large pink saxifrage, while the deep reddish-purple primula  covered every open space. There was also a very tiny pink primula--the  smallest I have ever seen--and another one like a pink primrose, that  grew on the banks above the path. We went along quite slowly all the  way, botanising and admiring the scenery. The path mostly led along the  top of a ridge, and the views and colours of the many-hued rhododendrons  in the gullies on either side were very delightful. Gnatong, where we  were to spend the night, was a very small and rather dirty village lying  in a hollow and surrounded by grassy hills. The fir trees (_Abies  Webbiana_) no longer surrounded it, as those anywhere near had been cut  down for firewood, or for building houses. From here I was able to  telephone to Mr. Isaacs, Mr. Macdonald's head clerk at Yatung, to ask  him to make arrangements for ponies and mules for us both at Yatung and  at Phari now that our transport had broken down. Wonderful rumours  seemed to have preceded our advent. Stories that we were coming with  1,000 mules and 500 men seemed to have been spread about in Tibet.    Gnatong is a most depressing place, and only owes its existence to the  fact that it is the first stopping place for the caravans that cross  over the Jelep Pass on the British side of the frontier. Rain always  falls there, the rainfall in the year being nearly 200 inches, and when  rain does not fall the place is enveloped in mist, with the result that  the mud was horrible. It poured with rain all the time that we were  there and we left again in heavy rain for the Jelep Pass 8 miles  distant. We were already over 12,000 feet when we started, and the top  of the pass was 14,390 feet, so that it was not a very serious climb.  There was no view of any kind to be had as the rain fell steadily all  the way and the hillsides were all veiled in mist. We had occasional  glimpses of a hillside pink, white or yellow with rhododendrons, which  now grew only about 5 feet high. I counted six or seven different  varieties of primulas on the way, but near the top there was still  plenty of the old winter snow lying about and the Alpine flowers were  scarcely out. A big heap of stones marked the summit of the pass and the  frontier between Sikkim and Tibet, and a few sticks, to which were  attached strings covered with small pieces of rag on which were  inscribed prayers, fluttered out in the strong wind that always blows up  there. In the cold rain this was not a cheerful spot to linger in, so we  hurried on down a steep and stony path and after descending a few  hundred feet emerged out of the mist and rain and obtained glimpses of a  really blue sky such as we had not seen for weeks. We had arrived at  last in Tibet.                                          CHAPTER II                     THE CHUMBI VALLEY AND THE TIBETAN PLATEAU      The range of mountains which here forms the boundary between Sikkim and  Tibet runs nearly North and South, and the two main passes across it are  the Jelep La and the Nathu La, the latter being a few miles to the North  of the Jelep La and about the same height. The Jelep La being the main  trade route across which the telegraph line runs, and over which the  postal runners travel, is kept open all"]]]
