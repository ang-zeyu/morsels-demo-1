At that moment he perceived the third, the Hampshire, coming on  with twenty-six guns in battery on each side, with a crew of two hundred  and thirty men.    \"He at once proceeded to meet her, all his guns pointed to sink her, ran  under her lee, yard-arm to yard-arm, and having brought his ship to,  poured in his broadside. This was done so effectively that the  Hampshire, after keeping on about her own length, went down. Iberville  at once wore and turned on the Hudson Bay, the ship of the remaining two  that could most easily enter St. Teresa River; but as he was on the  point of boarding her, the commandant struck his flag and surrendered.    \"Iberville then gave chase to the Deringue, the third, which was  escaping to the northeast, and which was only a good cannon-shot off;  but as that vessel was as good a sailor as his own ship he soon gave up  the chase, not daring to crowd sail, having had much of his rigging cut,  two pumps burst, his shrouds considerably injured, hull cut up by seven  cannon-balls and pierced at the water's edge, with no way of stopping  the leak. He accordingly veered and sent the Sieur de la Sale in his  boat with twenty-five men to man the prize. He then proceeded to repair  damage, and having done so with great expedition, he renewed the chase  of the enemy, who was now three leagues off.    \"He began to gain on him when, in the evening, the wind changed to the  north, and a thick fog suddenly rising, he lost sight of the Deringue.  This accident compelled him to rejoin the Hudson Bay, and he anchored  near the Hampshire, now almost out of sight, and from which not a soul  had been saved.\"    In this fight with an enemy more than twice his superior in guns and men  Iberville had sunk one ship, captured another, and put the third to  flight; but this was followed by other experiences, which at the outset  presented conditions apparently not less desperate and discouraging. Two  days later, pending his siege operations against Port Nelson, a violent  gale arose, in which, says Charlevoix, \"In spite of all d'Iberville's  efforts to ride it out--and there was not, perhaps, in the French navy  one more skilful in handling a ship--he was driven ashore with his  vessel, the Pelican, and his prize, the Hudson Bay. The misfortune  happened at night, the darkness increasing the horrors of the storm and  preventing them from beaching the vessels at a favorable place and so  saving them, and before the break of day they broke up and filled.\"    Both vessels were crowded with wounded men and prisoners, who  endeavored as best they could to reach the shore in the storm and  darkness. Twenty-three perished in the attempt, but fortunately the  receding tide left such shallows that the rest reached shore, and most  of the prisoners successfully sought the friendly shelter of Fort  Nelson.    Iberville now found himself in most desperate plight--shipwrecked on a  barren coast, with a hostile garrison on land, the return of the English  ship at sea possible, and destitute of provisions. He turned to the  wrecked vessels and found that it was possible to obtain from them  cannon and other munitions of war, and, undismayed, he set his cold,  wet, and hungry crew at this task, resolved to obtain food by carrying  the English fort by assault. At this juncture his missing vessels,  having extricated themselves from the ice of Hudson Strait, appeared,  and the fort surrendered without putting Iberville to the last proof of  his courage.    As might be expected, Iberville became the hero of the day on his return  to France in 1697; but true to himself and his career, he sought the  influence of friends at court only to obtain other difficult and  dangerous service that might add to the glory of France. He was now to  enter on a new career as an explorer, colonizer, and administrator,  where, if he was to perform less brilliant deeds than in earlier life,  he was destined to open up to settlement by his countrymen the fertile  lands of Louisiana, and thus lay the foundations of its future  greatness.    It was now twelve years since the tragic fate of La Salle's colony on  the coast of Texas had spread dismay and terror among all who had been  especially interested in the scheme of French colonization on the  Mississippi River. The sentiment seemed to be that the mouth of the  great river could never be found and that further effort would only  result in useless sacrifice of life and vessels. With the march of time,  however, these impressions of doubt and disaster had faded out of mind,  and as now the attention of the ministry was especially turned to that  part of Louisiana which could be reached from the St. Lawrence, it  appeared to Iberville to be a suitable season to revive the project of  discovering the mouth of the Mississippi and of planting a colony.    A plan for the colonization of Louisiana was formally submitted to the  French Government by M. de Remonville, while Iberville for his part  pledged his reputation as a navigator both to find the mouth of the  Mississippi and to successfully plant there a colony. The ministry were  easily persuaded that the scheme was practicable and advantageous, their  decision being doubtless affected by the knowledge that both Spain and  England contemplated the early settlement of the northern coasts of the  Gulf of Mexico. It was even reported, as afterward transpired to be the  truth, that colonizing expeditions were already en route, and in order  to insure protection should Iberville first reach the ground, Count  Pontchartrain projected and arranged for the construction of a fort at  the mouth of the Mississippi.    As was always the case, schemes of trade were interwoven with the policy  of colonization and extension of the royal domain. The principal objects  of the trade proved fanciful or chimerical, being, first, the idea of  making bison wool an article of trade, a scheme fostered in France by La  Salle, and, second, in the hope that valuable pearl fisheries might be  found. In Iberville's instructions we find that \"one of the great  objects proposed to the king, when he was urged to discover the mouth of  the Mississippi, was to obtain wool from the cattle (buffalo) of that  country, and for this purpose these animals must be tamed and parked and  the calves sent to France.\"    Iberville worked with his usual energy, and the expedition, consisting  of two small frigates, the Badine, the Marin, and two Norman  fishing-boats, sailed from Brest, October 4, 1698. It was Friday, but  Iberville no more than Columbus minded the day, and in the reluctance of  the other vessels, himself led in the Badine.    A storm off Madeira caused the disappearance of one of the  fishing-boats, but after a short search Iberville tarried no more than  he did in the Hudson Straits for his missing consort, but pushed on and  reached San Domingo early in December. Here the governor, Ducasse, was  so impressed with Iberville's elucidation of his projects that he  expressed to the home government his opinion that the views and genius  of Iberville seemed to equal his valor in war.    English vessels had been cruising in the neighborhood of San Domingo,  which led Iberville to believe that it was a colonizing expedition, so  he worked day and night in completing his preparations, and on January  1, 1699, sailed for the Gulf of Mexico. On the afternoon of the  twenty-third day, Iberville as usual leading, land was sighted in the  northeast. It proved to be the harbor of Pensacola, where Iberville was  chagrined to find himself preceded by a Spanish colony under command of  Don Andres de la Riola. There were two frigates yet in the harbor, which  four months before had brought up three hundred colonists from Vera  Cruz. The half-finished fort, the dissatisfied garrison, and the  uncertainty of the future explorations to the westward were so many  inducements for Iberville to drive out the Spaniards and secure the  harbor. Iberville made arrangements to enter the harbor, but was  notified by the Spanish governor that he had formal orders from Spain to  permit no foreign ships to enter the harbor. Under pretence that he  feared heavy weather the French fleet sounded the entrance to the harbor  and prepared to enter. The Spanish commander, however, begged that they  would retire, and fortunately having been given information by the  Spanish pilot, Iberville decided to sail to the west. Iberville,  exploring the coast, anchored at the eastern point of the entrance to  Mobile Bay, where violent gales nearly destroyed the squadron.    [Illustration: Bienville.]    Reconnoitring boats giving such unsatisfactory reports of the depth of  the channel, Iberville determined, with his usual energy, to survey it  himself. Taking his younger brother Bienville and a crew of his  faithful Canadians he started, despite approaching darkness, so as to  begin work at day-light; the storm breaking with great violence,  Iberville's efforts to make headway over the billows were in vain.  Finally, his rowers exhausted, the boat was turned to the nearest land,  but the sea was so high and the wind so violent that unceasing efforts  were needful to prevent the boat from swamping. It was due to  Iberville's great skill that the boat was finally beached in a  favorable spot on the sandy beach, which the crew reached with  difficulty, so exhausted were they with their struggles. Here they were  weather-bound three days, and so had an opportunity to explore the  island. It was with horror that they discovered in one place ghastly  piles of human bones and skulls, mute witnesses of a scene of slaughter,  which terrified many of the crew until they found the island to be  uninhabited. The island, now known as Dauphin, was called Massacre by  Iberville, who, undisturbed by the sight, visited the mainland with a  few of his men and made every effort to discover the inhabitants, of  whom he found "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36124"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 1, August, 1851 (#8)"],[1,"could not fail of exceeding  injury, if their design should be executed, and begged them to adopt  some other work as a medium for the display of the Websterian  innovations. The Harpers replied that he might select his own  standard; they believed he had, perhaps unconsciously, followed  Webster in his _manuscript_, and that the several productions of his  which they had published in previous years had all been printed  according to Webster's Dictionary, which was the guide used in their  printing offices.    The incidents of Dr. Webster's life after the publication of the  second edition of his Dictionary, in 1840, were few and unimportant.  Indeed, with that effort he regarded his public life as brought to a  close. He passed through a serene old age, which was terminated by a  peaceful death, on the twenty-eighth of May, 1843, when he was in the  eighty-fifth year of his age.          DR. MERLE D'AUBIGNE AND THE ENGLISH CHURCH.      The celebrated German historian, Dr. MERLE D'AUBIGNE, is now in  England, and in consequence of certain proceedings growing out of his  occupation of an Episcopal pulpit recently, he has published a letter  to the Archbishop of Canterbury concerning the general subject of the  exclusion of continental Protestant ministers from the pulpits of  English churches. He is aware that, in consequence of the Act of  Uniformity, there are churches which cannot be opened to those  ministers, but he hopes that this law of exclusion will be repealed.  \"It is no longer in harmony with the spirit and the wants of the  church in the age in which we live.\" The Calvinistic historian  expresses his conviction that the reestablishment of the Annual  Convocation would not reform the Church. The Convocation has been for  more than a century deprived of its powers, and it is to Parliament  that the question now belongs. He says:         \"Why should I not express to you, my lord, a desire which I       have long had in my heart? This desire is, that being       surrounded by ministers and members of the Church the most       enlightened and most devoted to God and to his word, you       should digest and present to Parliament a plan, not to       _effect_ (_sic_) a reform of the Church, but to _establish       the authority_ (_sic_) which should be charged with its       reform and government. It seems to me that the best way       would be to establish a body similar to that which governs       the Episcopal church of America, composed of three chambers,       that of the bishops, that of the presbyters, and that of the       members of the Church, the two latter being ordinarily       united in one. The Americans of the United States have       received so much from you (they have received every thing,       even their very existence), why should you not take       something from them? I am convinced that sooner or later a       reform _must_ take place in the government of the Church of       England: it is important that it should be done well. I       think that there would be some hope of its being       accomplished in a good sense, if it were done while you, my       lord, are Primate of the Church, and while Victoria is Queen       of England.\"    Every thing seems to tend to an entire revolution in the British  ecclesiastical system, and the cooeperation of Dr. Merle and other  continental writers with those who are agitating the subject in  England--demanding the separation of the church from the state--makes  the prospect of such a separation more imminent than it has ever been  hitherto.          THE EXILE'S SUNSET SONG.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE    BY J. R. THOMPSON.          When from thy side, love,        In silence and gloom,          Half broken-hearted            Fate tore me away,      All humbled in pride, love,        I thought in my doom,          That Hope had departed            For ever and aye!        But Fate may not banish        From memory's store,          That blissful communion            Of years that are flown,      Nor make yet to vanish        The lustre which o'er          Our fond thoughts of union,            So tenderly shone.        And still o'er the ocean        My fancy takes flight,          Where oft I see gleaming            Thy figure afar;      And I think with emotion,        That sometimes at night,          We watch the same beaming            And tremulous star.        The sunsets so golden.        That stream round me here,          But call up thy shadow            The landscape between:      And when in the olden        Dim season so dear,          It tripped o'er the meadow            With step of a queen.        As the light of the moon, love,        Like snow softly falls,          And rests on the mountain,            And silvers the sea,      That midnight in June, love,        My mem'ry recalls,          When up to the fountain            I clambered with thee.        How sweetly the river        Reflected the ray          Of moon through the willows            Or sun o'er the hill:      Does the moonbeam there quiver,        The sunset there play,          Upon its gay billows            As splendidly still?        My spirit is weary--        An exile I grieve,          When morn's early voices            A glad song proclaim,      And the faint Miserere        Of nature at eve,          To me but rejoices            To murmer thy name.        Yet Hope, reappearing,        A vision unfolds,          Of rapture together            In joy's happy reign,      When love all endearing        The full eye beholds,          We'll walk o'er the heather            At sunset again.    RICHMOND, Va.          DRAMATIC FRAGMENTS.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE,    BY R. H. STODDARD.      THE GAME OF CHESS.        We played at chess, Bianca and myself,      One afternoon, but neither won the game,      Both absent-minded, thinking of our hearts      Moving the ivory pawns from black to white,      Shifted to little purpose round the board;      Sometimes we quite forgot it in a sigh      And then remembered it, and moved again;      Looking the while along the slopes beyond,      Barred by blue peaks, the fountain, and the grove      Where lovers sat in shadow, back again,      With sideway glances in each other's eyes;      Unknowingly I made a lucky move,      Whereby I checked my mate, and gained a queen;      My couch drew nearer hers, I took her hand--      A soft white hand that gave itself away--      Told o'er the simple story of my love,      In simplest phrases which are always best,      And prayed her if she loved me in return--      A fabled doubt--to give her heart to me;      And then, and there, above that game of chess,      Not finished yet, in maiden trustfulness,      She gave me, what I knew was mine, her heart!      FROM A PLAY.        Alas! I think of you the live-long day,      Plying my needle by the little stand,      And wish that we had never, never met,      Or I were dead, or you were married off,      Though that would kill me; I lay down my work,      And take the lute you gave me, but the strings      Have grown so tuneless that I cannot play;      I sing the favorite airs we used to sing,      The sweet old tunes we love, and weep aloud!      I sought forgetfulness, and tried to-day      To read a chapter in the Holy Book;      I could not see a line, I only read      The solemn sonnets that you sent to me:      Nor can I pray as I was wont to do,      For you come in between me and the Lord,      And when I strive to lift my soul above,      My wits are wandering, and I sob your name!      And nights, when I am lying on my bed,      (I hope such thoughts are not unmaidenly,)      I think of you, and fall asleep, and dream      I am your own, your wedded, happy wife,--      But that can never, never be on earth!          THE COUNTESS IDA HAHN-HAHN.      We gave in the last _International_ a short notice of \"_Von Babylon  nach Jerusalem_\" (A Journey from Babylon to Jerusalem), by Ida,  Countess of Hahn-Hahn, in which she declares her conversion to  Christianity and Catholicism. What the Germans themselves think of  this work may be gathered from the following brief review, which has  just fallen under our notice in the _Central Blatt_. The article is  curious, from the \"intensely German\" style and spirit in which it is  written, though we cannot very warmly commend either.    \"The above-mentioned work,\" which contains an account of the  conversion of its celebrated authoress to the Catholic belief, says  the critic, \"presents a sad picture of the complete decay and  dissolution of a _void subjectivity_ (a vacant mind).    \"The writer falls a sacrifice to her exclusive, aristocratic position  in society. Without occupying any place in the world, won and  maintained by personal ability, and consequently without a  well-grounded moral standard, she wanders like a homeless being from  land to land, every where influenced, 'as far as it agreed with her  disposition,' by her momentary interests, and thus rendering apparent  the barrenness of her soul. But this had been developed at an early  period. 'That this feeling (that of joy) was occasionally accompanied  by the deepest discontent, appearing as an unearthly _ennui_--and that  over it swept the darkest melancholy, will be readily intelligible to  every one, for they are the twin sisters of the fortune of this  world.' 'And occasionally it was a kind of heroism, in that I sat  myself down, and--wrote a romance. Was it finished, I travelled--did I  return, I described the tour--was there a time when the book was  complete and circumstances did not permit of travelling, I took with  raging appetite to reading--and when I no longer wrote, no longer  travelled, and could no longer read for any determined  purpose--because I had none--I knew not what to do with my time. I  could not create illusions, and say to myself, Try this! try that!"]]]
