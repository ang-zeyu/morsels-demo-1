She addressed a memorial on the subject to the House of  Lords, but they gave her no redress; indeed it would not have been  consistent with the practice of that body to interfere on such an  occasion. Soon after their arrival, the margrave purchased through  trustees, Lord Craven's estate of Benham, and the mansion of  Brandenburgh House, a place celebrated as afterwards affording a  retreat to Queen Caroline, the wife of George IV. Until the margrave's  death in 1806, it was a scene of continued profusion and gayety, in  which the luxuries and amusements of an English mansion were united  with those of a German court, \"My whole enjoyment,\" says the  margravine, \"during the margrave's valuable life, was to do every  thing in my power, to make him not only comfortable, but happy. Under  my management, the world imagined that he spent double his income.\"  Her attachment to her second husband was strong. She speaks of him  with an enthusiasm and devotion which bear the stamp of sincerity. \"I  believe,\" she says, \"a better man never existed. There never was a  being who could act upon more sincere principles. Nothing could divert  him from what was right. None could bear with patience, like himself,  the ill conduct of those to whom he was attached. None could more  easily forgive.\" After his decease, the margravine, who succeeded to  the large property which he left, felt impatient to recommence her  wanderings. On the restoration she sailed for France, and, after being  interrupted in her movements by the reign of the hundred days, reached  Rome, where it was said that she kept open house for all the  revolutionists of all countries who chose to accept her hospitalities.  The King of Naples afterwards presented her with a small estate, in  which she built a palace, where she resided till her death, which  occurred on January 13, 1828. Only two years previously, and when she  was seventy-six years old, she surprised and delighted the English  world by the publication of her well-known memoirs. This work is  perhaps one of the best examples of the French memoirs which English  literature possesses. It is indeed thoroughly French, not only in  spirit but in idiom, and, to the reader, has all the appearance of a  translation from that language. It thus affords, in its style, a  remarkable contrast to the book of travels above noticed. It contains  a vast variety of anecdotes and sketches of character, always amusing  if not always accurate. It has no continuity of narrative, leaping  backwards and forwards through all ages, and among every variety of  subject: from a description of the monument which she erected to the  memory of her husband, she takes occasion to give a rapid sketch of  the history of the art of sculpture. The least pleasing feature in the  work is its intense egotism. The margravine was a woman of  wonderfully versatile genius. She wrote with fluency in French and  German. She was an accomplished musician and actress; and she tells  us, \"I have executed many busts myself, and among others one of the  margrave, which is generally allowed to be extremely like him.\"          LONDON DESCRIBED BY A PARISIAN.      M. Francis Wey, who is a college professor and _litterateur_ of some  eminence in Paris, has published for visitors from the continent to  the Great Exhibition, a volume entitled _Guides a Londres_, composed,  we believe, of a series of articles, _Les Anglais chez Eux_ (the  English at Home), which he had contributed to the _Musee des  Familles_, an old and favorite Parisian journal. It is very amusing to  see the manner in which these things are received by the British  press. The sensitiveness of which the Americans are accused is quite  equalled in that which is displayed in the London criticisms of  Monsieur Wey. And just at this time it is all the more pleasant to us,  for that our amiable Mother-Country critics are quoting with so much  enjoyment the characterizations of us poor United-Statesers, done in  the same way, by a gentleman of the same country. Even _Blackwood_  does not seem to have a suspicion that a Frenchman could caricature or  in any way exaggerate the publicities or domesticities of New-York;  but all the independent, care-for-nothing John Bulls see only  \"rancor,\" \"ill-will,\" and \"absurdity\" in the Frenchman's views of  English society. The _Literary Gazette_, the _Weekly News_, and all  the rest, have the same tone. French travellers, it is said--         \"Instead of patiently collecting their facts, they _invent_       them. Instead of representing social usages as they really       are, they state them as what they choose to suppose. They       mistake flippancy for wit, and imperturbable assurance for       knowledge. They speak _ex cathedra_ of matters of which they       are profoundly ignorant. And the consequence of all this is       that they commit the drollest blunders, make the most       startling assertions, indulge in the most grotesque       appreciations, and flounder in the most extravagant       absurdities.\"    We wonder if a single British reviewer will introduce, with such a  paragraph, his extracts from the Letters on America, by M. XAVIER  MARMIER? Not a bit of it.    On the English language, M. Wey says--         \"The Englishman has invented for himself a language adapted       to his placid manners and silent tastes. This language is a       murmur, accompanied by soft hissings; it falls from the       lips, but is scarcely articulated; if the chest or throat be       employed to increase the power of the voice, the words       become changed and scarcely intelligible; if cried aloud,       they are hoarse, and resemble the confused croaking of frogs       in marshes.\"         \"The English are passionately attached to their language.       They have only consented to borrow one single word from us,       and that is employed by their innkeepers--_table d'hote_,       which they pronounce _taible dott_. And yet we have taken       hundreds of words from them!\"    English women--         \"English women give to us the preference over their own       countrymen. Our gallantry is something new to them, and our       politeness touches their hearts. But though they love us, we       are not liked by their lords and masters. There is no       exaggeration in all that has been said of the beauty of       English women--an assemblage of them would realize the       paradise of Mahomet.\"    Their dresses--         \"Many white gowns are to be seen. White is a _recherche_       luxury in that land of tallow and smoke, where linen becomes       dirty in three hours. However, good taste is making some       progress. Ladies may be met with who are well dressed,       although, generally speaking, a sort of audacity is       displayed in wearing the most irreconcilable colors. What       gives English women a somewhat _bizarre_ appearance, is the       custom they have of swelling out their petticoats, by means       of circles of whalebone or iron:--this causes them to       resemble large bells in movement.\"    English manners--         \"English manners, rigid and cold, and dominated by arid       rationalism, are the work of Cromwell. His bigotry and       hypocrisy, his exterior austerity, his narrow formalism,       suit the Englishman; he keeps up Cromwell's character, and       admires himself in his usages. But he has no pity for his       model--he never forgives Cromwell for having made him what       he is. His spite towards that man is the last cry of nature,       and the vague regret of a liberty of imagination of which       neither the joys or the aspirations have been known since       his time.\" \"They have no grace, no _desinvoltura_, no poesy       in them, but are methodical, reasonable, indefatigable in       work and in amassing lucre.\"    How the English love--    \"They love nothing with the heart; when they do love, it is  exclusively of the head.\"    English bankers--         \"In France we have the love of display; but in London it is       not so. There, some of the principal bankers go every       morning to the butchers' shops to buy their own chops, and       they carry them ostensibly to some tavern in Cheapside or       Fleet Street, where they cook them themselves. Then they buy       three pennyworth of rye-bread, and publicly eat this Spartan       breakfast. The exhibition fills their clients with       admiration. But in the evening these good men make up for       this by taking in their own palaces suppers worthy of       Lucullus.\"    Flunkeys--         \"The English aristocracy are distinguished by the number,       the canes, and the wigs of their lacqueys. Seeing constantly       a footman, well powdered and bewigged, carry horizontally a       large Voltaire cane behind certain sumptuous carriages, I       asked for an explanation; it was soon given--wig, powder,       and cane are aristocratic privileges. Not only must a man       have a certain number of quarterings to be authorized to       make his servants use such things, but he must pay so much       tax for the lacquey, so much for the wig, so much for the       tail to the wig, and so much for the cane.\"    What most strikes a Frenchman in London--    \"The coldness of the men towards the fair sex, and their profound  passion for horses.\"    Officers of the life and horse guards--    \"Cupid seems to have chosen them--they are possessed of such ideal  beauty.\"    English taverns--         \"The Englishman likes to be alone, even at the tavern. He       fastens himself up in a box, where none can see him. There       he drinks with taciturn phlegm. He takes tea, boiling grog,       porter of the color of ink, and beer not less black. He is       very fond of brandy, and drinks large glasses of it at a       draught. He does not go to the tavern to amuse himself, but       because drinking is a grave occupation. The more he swallows       the calmer he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3623"],[0,"The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion (#8)"],[1,"the men sit and sing.  Afterwards performers, wearing head-dresses to represent the long  neck and small head of the emu, mimic the appearance of the bird as  it stands aimlessly peering about in all directions.    The Indians of British Columbia live largely upon the fish which  abound in their seas and rivers. If the fish do not come in due  season, and the Indians are hungry, a Nootka wizard will make an  image of a swimming fish and put it into the water in the direction  from which the fish generally appear. This ceremony, accompanied by  a prayer to the fish to come, will cause them to arrive at once. The  islanders of Torres Straits use models of dugong and turtles to  charm dugong and turtle to their destruction. The Toradjas of  Central Celebes believe that things of the same sort attract each  other by means of their indwelling spirits or vital ether. Hence  they hang up the jawbones of deer and wild pigs in their houses, in  order that the spirits which animate these bones may draw the living  creatures of the same kind into the path of the hunter. In the  island of Nias, when a wild pig has fallen into the pit prepared for  it, the animal is taken out and its back is rubbed with nine fallen  leaves, in the belief that this will make nine more wild pigs fall  into the pit, just as the nine leaves fell from the tree. In the  East Indian islands of Saparoea, Haroekoe, and Noessa Laut, when a  fisherman is about to set a trap for fish in the sea, he looks out  for a tree, of which the fruit has been much pecked at by birds.  From such a tree he cuts a stout branch and makes of it the  principal post in his fish-trap; for he believes that, just as the  tree lured many birds to its fruit, so the branch cut from that tree  will lure many fish to the trap.    The western tribes of British New Guinea employ a charm to aid the  hunter in spearing dugong or turtle. A small beetle, which haunts  coco-nut trees, is placed in the hole of the spear-haft into which  the spear-head fits. This is supposed to make the spear-head stick  fast in the dugong or turtle, just as the beetle sticks fast to a  man's skin when it bites him. When a Cambodian hunter has set his  nets and taken nothing, he strips himself naked, goes some way off,  then strolls up to the net as if he did not see it, lets himself be  caught in it, and cries, \"Hillo! what's this? I'm afraid I'm  caught.\" After that the net is sure to catch game. A pantomime of  the same sort has been acted within the living memory in our  Scottish Highlands. The Rev. James Macdonald, now of Reay in  Caithness, tells us that in his boyhood when he was fishing with  companions about Loch Aline and they had had no bites for a long  time, they used to make a pretence of throwing one of their fellows  overboard and hauling him out of the water, as if he were a fish;  after that the trout or silloch would begin to nibble, according as  the boat was on fresh or salt water. Before a Carrier Indian goes  out to snare martens, he sleeps by himself for about ten nights  beside the fire with a little stick pressed down on his neck. This  naturally causes the fall-stick of his trap to drop down on the neck  of the marten. Among the Galelareese, who inhabit a district in the  northern part of Halmahera, a large island to the west of New  Guinea, it is a maxim that when you are loading your gun to go out  shooting, you should always put the bullet in your mouth before you  insert it in the gun; for by so doing you practically eat the game  that is to be hit by the bullet, which therefore cannot possibly  miss the mark. A Malay who has baited a trap for crocodiles, and is  awaiting results, is careful in eating his curry always to begin by  swallowing three lumps of rice successively; for this helps the bait  to slide more easily down the crocodile's throat. He is equally  scrupulous not to take any bones out of his curry; for, if he did,  it seems clear that the sharp-pointed stick on which the bait is  skewered would similarly work itself loose, and the crocodile would  get off with the bait. Hence in these circumstances it is prudent  for the hunter, before he begins his meal, to get somebody else to  take the bones out of his curry, otherwise he may at any moment have  to choose between swallowing a bone and losing the crocodile.    This last rule is an instance of the things which the hunter  abstains from doing lest, on the principle that like produces like,  they should spoil his luck. For it is to be observed that the system  of sympathetic magic is not merely composed of positive precepts; it  comprises a very large number of negative precepts, that is,  prohibitions. It tells you not merely what to do, but also what to  leave undone. The positive precepts are charms: the negative  precepts are taboos. In fact the whole doctrine of taboo, or at all  events a large part of it, would seem to be only a special  application of sympathetic magic, with its two great laws of  similarity and contact. Though these laws are certainly not  formulated in so many words nor even conceived in the abstract by  the savage, they are nevertheless implicitly believed by him to  regulate the course of nature quite independently of human will. He  thinks that if he acts in a certain way, certain consequences will  inevitably follow in virtue of one or other of these laws; and if  the consequences of a particular act appear to him likely to prove  disagreeable or dangerous, he is naturally careful not to act in  that way lest he should incur them. In other words, he abstains from  doing that which, in accordance with his mistaken notions of cause  and effect, he falsely believes would injure him; in short, he  subjects himself to a taboo. Thus taboo is so far a negative  application of practical magic. Positive magic or sorcery says, \"Do  this in order that so and so may happen.\" Negative magic or taboo  says, \"Do not do this, lest so and so should happen.\" The aim of  positive magic or sorcery is to produce a desired event; the aim of  negative magic or taboo is to avoid an undesirable one. But both  consequences, the desirable and the undesirable, are supposed to be  brought about in accordance with the laws of similarity and contact.  And just as the desired consequence is not really effected by the  observance of a magical ceremony, so the dreaded consequence does  not really result from the violation of a taboo. If the supposed  evil necessarily followed a breach of taboo, the taboo would not be  a taboo but a precept of morality or common sense. It is not a taboo  to say, \"Do not put your hand in the fire\"; it is a rule of common  sense, because the forbidden action entails a real, not an imaginary  evil. In short, those negative precepts which we call taboo are just  as vain and futile as those positive precepts which we call sorcery.  The two things are merely opposite sides or poles of one great  disastrous fallacy, a mistaken conception of the association of  ideas. Of that fallacy, sorcery is the positive, and taboo the  negative pole. If we give the general name of magic to the whole  erroneous system, both theoretical and practical, then taboo may be  defined as the negative side of practical magic. To put this in  tabular form:                      Magic                    |         ----------------------         |                    |    Theoretical           Practical    (Magic as a          (Magic as a  pseudo-science)         pseudo-art)                                |                           -----------------                           |               |                      Positive Magic   Negative Magic                  or Sorcery      or Taboo        I have made these remarks on taboo and its relations to magic  because I am about to give some instances of taboos observed by  hunters, fishermen, and others, and I wished to show that they fall  under the head of Sympathetic Magic, being only particular  applications of that general theory. Thus, among the Esquimaux boys  are forbidden to play cat's cradle, because if they did so their  fingers might in later life become entangled in the harpoon-line.  Here the taboo is obviously an application of the law of similarity,  which is the basis of homoeopathic magic: as the child's fingers are  entangled by the string in playing cat's cradle, so they will be  entangled by the harpoonline when he is a man and hunts whales.  Again, among the Huzuls of the Carpathian Mountains the wife of a  hunter may not spin while her husband is eating, or the game will  turn and wind like the spindle, and the hunter will be unable to hit  it. Here again the taboo is clearly derived from the law of  similarity. So, too, in most parts of ancient Italy women were  forbidden by law to spin on the highroads as they walked, or even to  carry their spindles openly, because any such action was believed to  injure the crops. Probably the notion was that the twirling of the  spindle would twirl the corn-stalks and prevent them from growing  straight. So, too, among the Ainos of Saghalien a pregnant woman may  not spin nor twist ropes for two months before her delivery, because  they think that if she did so the child's guts might be entangled  like the thread. For a like reason in Bilaspore, a district of  India, when the chief men of a village meet in council, no one  present should twirl a spindle; for they think that if such a thing  were to happen, the discussion, like the spindle, would move in a  circle and never be wound up. In some of the East Indian islands any  one who comes to the house of a hunter must walk straight in; he may  not loiter at the door, for were he to do so, the game would in like  manner stop in front of the hunter's snares and then turn back,  instead of being caught in the trap. For a similar reason it is a  rule with the Toradjas of Central Celebes that no one may stand or  loiter on the ladder of a house where there "]]]
