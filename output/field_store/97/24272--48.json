The family of the Three-horned Osmia is settled  in the spiral of those shells, which is subdivided into chambers by mud  partitions.    Let us inspect the stone-heaps, especially those which come from the  quarry-works. Here we often find the Field-mouse sitting on a grass  mattress, nibbling acorns, almonds, olive-stones and apricot-stones. The  Rodent varies his diet: to oily and farinaceous foods he adds the Snail.  When he is gone, he has left behind him, under the overhanging stones,  mixed up with the remains of other victuals, an assortment of empty  shells, sometimes plentiful enough to remind me of the heap of Snails  which, cooked with spinach and eaten country-fashion on Christmas Eve,  are flung away next day by the housewife. This gives the Three-horned  Osmia a handsome collection of tenements; and she does not fail to  profit by them. Then again, even if the Field-mouse's conchological  museum be lacking, the same broken stones serve as a refuge for  Garden-snails who come to live there and end by dying there. When we see  Three-horned Osmiae enter the crevices of old walls and of stone-heaps,  there is no doubt about their occupation: they are getting free lodgings  out of the old Snail-shells of those labyrinths.    The Horned Osmia, who is less common, might easily also be less  ingenious, that is to say, less rich in varieties of houses. She seems  to scorn empty shells. The only homes that I know her to inhabit are the  reeds of the hurdles and the deserted cells of the Masked Anthophora.    All the other Osmiae whose method of nest-building I know work with  green putty, a paste made of some crushed leaf or other; and none of  them, except Latreille's Osmia, is provided with the horned or tubercled  armour of the mud-kneaders. I should like to know what plants are used  in making the putty; probably each species has its own preferences and  its little professional secrets; but hitherto observation has taught me  nothing concerning these details. Whatever worker prepare it, the putty  is very much the same in appearance. When fresh, it is always a clear  dark green. Later, especially in the parts exposed to the air, it  changes, no doubt through fermentation, to the colour of dead leaves,  to brown, to dull-yellow; and the leafy character of its origin is no  longer apparent. But uniformity in the materials employed must not  lead us to believe in uniformity in the lodging; on the contrary, this  lodging varies greatly with the different species, though there is a  marked predilection in favour of empty shells. Thus Latreille's Osmia,  together with the Three-horned Osmia, uses the spacious structures  of the Mason-bee of the Sheds; she likes the magnificent cells of the  Masked Anthophora; and she is always ready to establish herself in the  cylinder of any reed lying flat on the ground.    I have already spoken of an Osmia (O. cyanoxantha, PEREZ) who elects  to make her home in the old nests of the Mason-bee of the Pebbles. (Cf.  \"The Mason-bees\": chapter 10.--Translator's Note.) Her closing-plug is  made of a stout concrete, consisting of fair-sized bits of gravel  sunk in the green paste; but for the inner partitions she employs  only unalloyed putty. As the outer door, situated on the curve of an  unprotected dome, is exposed to the inclemencies of the weather,  the mother has to think of fortifying it. Danger, no doubt, is the  originator of that gritty concrete.    The Golden Osmia (O. aurulenta, LATR.) absolutely insists on an empty  Snail-shell as her residence. The Brown or Girdled Snail, the Garden  Snail and especially the Common Snail, who has a more spacious spiral,  all scattered at random in the grass, at the foot of the walls and of  the sun-swept rocks, furnish her with her usual dwelling-house. Her  dried putty is a kind of felt full of short white hairs. It must come  from some hairy-leaved plant, one of the Boragineae perhaps, rich both  in mucilage and the necessary bristles.    The Red Osmia (O. rufo-hirta, LATR.) has a weakness for the Brown Snail  and the Garden Snail, in whose shells I find her taking refuge in April  when the north-wind blows. I am not yet much acquainted with her work,  which should resemble that of the Golden Osmia.    The Green Osmia (O. viridana, MORAWITZ) takes up her quarters, tiny  creature that she is, in the spiral staircase of Bulimulus radiatus. It  is a very elegant, but very small lodging, to say nothing of the fact  that a considerable portion is taken up with the green-putty plug. There  is just room for two.    The Andrenoid Osmia (O. andrenoides, LATR.), who looks so curious, with  her naked red abdomen, appears to build her nest in the shell of the  Common Snail, where I discover her refuged.    The Variegated Osmia (O. versicolor, LATR.) settles in the Garden  Snail's shell, almost right at the bottom of the spiral.    The Blue Osmia (O. cyanea, KIRB.) seems to me to accept many different  quarters. I have extracted her from old nests of the Mason-bee of the  Pebbles, from the galleries dug in a roadside bank by the Colletes (A  short-tongued Burrowing-bee known also as the Melitta.--Translator's  Note.) and lastly from the cavities made by some digger or other in the  decayed trunk of a willow-tree.    Morawitz' Osmia (O. Morawitzi, PEREZ) is not uncommon in the old nests  of the Mason-bee of the Pebbles, but I suspect her of favouring other  lodgings besides.    The Three-pronged Osmia (O. tridentata, DUF. and PER.) creates a home of  her own, digging herself a channel with her mandibles in dry bramble and  sometimes in danewort. It mixes a few scrapings of perforated pith with  the green paste. Its habits are shared by the Ragged Osmia (O. detrita,  PEREZ) and by the Tiny Osmia (O. parvula, DUF.)    The Chalicodoma works in broad daylight, on a tile, on a pebble, on a  branch in the hedge; none of her trade-practises is kept a secret from  the observer's curiosity. The Osmia loves mystery. She wants a dark  retreat, hidden from the eye. I would like, nevertheless, to watch  her in the privacy of her home and to witness her work with the same  facility as if she were nest-building in the open air. Perhaps there are  some interesting characteristics to be picked up in the depths of her  retreats. It remains to be seen whether my wish can be realized.    When studying the insect's mental capacity, especially its very  retentive memory for places, I was led to ask myself whether it would  not be possible to make a suitably-chosen Bee build in any place that I  wished, even in my study. And I wanted, for an experiment of this sort,  not an individual but a numerous colony. My preference leant towards the  Three-horned Osmia, who is very plentiful in my neighbourhood, where,  together with Latreille's Osmia, she frequents in particular the  monstrous nests of the Chalicodoma of the Sheds. I therefore thought  out a scheme for making the Three-horned Osmia accept my study as her  settlement and build her nests in glass tubes, through which I could  easily watch the progress. To these crystal galleries, which might well  inspire a certain distrust, were to be added more natural retreats:  reeds of every length and thickness and disused Chalicodoma-cells taken  from among the biggest and the smallest. A scheme like this sounds mad.  I admit it, while mentioning that perhaps none ever succeeded so well  with me. We shall see as much presently.    My method is extremely simple. All I ask is that the birth of my  insects, that is to say, their first seeing the light, their emerging  from the cocoon, should take place on the spot where I propose to make  them settle. Here there must be retreats of no matter what nature,  but of a shape similar to that in which the Osmia delights. The first  impressions of sight, which are the most long-lived of any, shall bring  back my insects to the place of their birth. And not only will the  Osmiae return, through the always open windows, but they will always  nidify on the natal spot if they find something like the necessary  conditions.    And so, all through the winter, I collect Osmia-cocoons, picked up in  the nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds; I go to Carpentras to glean a  more plentiful supply in the nests of the Hairy-footed Anthophora, that  old acquaintance whose wonderful cities I used to undermine when I  was studying the history of the Oil-beetles. (This study is not yet  translated into English; but cf. \"The Life of the Fly\": chapters 2  and 4.--Translator's Note.) Later, at my request, a pupil and intimate  friend of mine, M. Henri Devillario, president of the civil court at  Carpentras, sends me a case of fragments broken off the banks frequented  by the Hairy-footed Anthophora and the Anthophora of the Walls, useful  clods which furnish a handsome adjunct to my collection. Indeed, at the  end, I find myself with handfuls of cocoons of the Three-horned Osmia.  To count them would weary my patience without serving any particular  purpose.    I spread out my stock in a large open box on a table which receives  a bright diffused light but not the direct rays of the sun. The table  stands between two windows facing south and overlooking the garden. When  the moment of hatching comes, those two windows will always remain open  to give the swarm entire liberty to go in and out as it pleases.  The glass tubes and the reed-stumps are laid here and there, in fine  disorder, close to the heap of cocoons and all in a horizontal position,  for the Osmia will have nothing to do with upright reeds. The hatching  of some of the Osmiae will therefore take place under cover of the  galleries destined to be the building-yard later; and the site will be  all the more deeply impressed on their memory. When I have made these  comprehensive arrangements, there is nothing more to be done; and I wait  patiently for the building-season to open.    My Osmiae "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#8)"],[1,"appear, on the faces  of the young, as small black points, which are incorrectly called \"worms.\"  It is true, that occasionally living animalcules are found in this  thickened sebaceous matter, but they can only be detected by the aid of the  microscope. This sebaceous matter acts not only to keep the skin flexible,  and furnish for the hair an oily dressing, but it especially serves to  protect the skin and hair, from the acridity arising from the perspiration.    [Sidenote: 14. Perspiration? Sweat glands? Of what do they consist?  Dimension of the tubes?]    14. THE PERSPIRATORY GLANDS.--The chief product of the skin's action is the  perspiration. For the formation of this, there are furnished countless  numbers of little sweat-glands in the true skin. They consist of fine  tubes, with globe-like coils at their deeper extremity. Their mouths or  openings may be seen with an ordinary magnifying glass, upon the fine  ridges which mark the fingers. These tubes, if uncoiled, measure about  one-tenth of an inch in length. In diameter, they are about one  three-hundredth of an inch, and upon certain parts of the body there are  not far from three thousand of these glands to the square inch. Their whole  number in the body is, therefore, very great; and, in fact, it is computed  if they were all united, end to end, their combined measurement would  exceed three miles. {46}    [Sidenote: 15. What is sensible perspiration? Insensible perspiration?]    15. THE SENSIBLE AND INSENSIBLE PERSPIRATION.--The pores of the skin are  constantly exhaling a watery fluid; but, under ordinary circumstances,  there is no moisture apparent upon the surface, for it evaporates as  rapidly as it is formed. This is called insensible perspiration. Under the  influence of heat or exercise, however, this fluid is excreted more  abundantly, and appears on the surface in the form of minute, colorless  drops. It is then termed sensible perspiration.    [Sidenote: 16. Components of perspiration? Upon what does perspiration  depend? Amount of perspiration daily?]    16. Water is the chief component of this fluid, there being about  ninety-eight parts of water to two parts of solid matter. The quantity  escaping from the body varies greatly, according to the temperature of the  air, the occupation of the individual, and other circumstances. The average  daily amount of this excretion, in the adult, is not far from thirty  ounces, nearly two pints, or more than nine grains each minute.    [Sidenote: 17. What does perspiration set free from the blood? What other  service does perspiration perform? Explain the process.]    17. THE USES OF THE PERSPIRATION.--Besides liberating from the blood this  large amount of water, with the effete matter it contains, the perspiration  serves to regulate the temperature of the body. That is to say, as  evaporation always diminishes temperature, so the perspiration, as it  passes off in the form of fine vapor, cools the surface. Accordingly, in  hot weather this function is much more active, and the cooling influence  increases in proportion. When the air is already charged with moisture, and  does not readily receive this vapor of the body, the heat of the atmosphere  apparently increases, and the discomfort therefrom is relatively greater.    [Sidenote: 18. Effect of interruption of excretion? What experiments are  mentioned?]    18. The importance of this excretion is shown by the effects that often  follow its temporary interruption, namely, headache, fever, and the other  symptoms that accompany {47} \"taking cold.\" When the perspiration is  completely checked, the consequences are very serious. Experiments have  been performed upon certain smaller animals, as rabbits, to ascertain the  results of closing the perspiratory tubes. When they are covered by a  coating of varnish impervious to water and gases, death ensues in from six  to twelve hours; the attendant symptoms resembling those of suffocation.    [Sidenote: 19. Give the story in relation to the boy covered with gold  foil.]    19. It is related that, at the coronation of one of the Popes about three  hundred years ago, a little boy was chosen to act the part of an angel; and  in order that his appearance might be as gorgeous as possible, he was  covered from head to foot with a coating of gold foil. He was soon taken  sick, and although every known means were employed for his recovery, except  the removal of his fatal golden covering, he died in a few hours.    [Sidenote: 20. Give the quotation. Perspiration?]    20. THE IMPORTANCE OF BATHING.--From these considerations, it is evident  that health must greatly depend upon the free action of the skin. \"He who  keeps the skin ruddy and soft, shuts many gates against disease.\" When the  watery portion of the perspiration evaporates, the solid matter is left  behind on the surface. There, also, remain the scales of the worn-out  cuticle, and the excess of sebaceous matter. In order to secure the natural  action of the skin, these impurities require to be removed by the frequent  application of water.    [Sidenote: 21. Ablution in warm climates? What advice is given?]    21. In warm climates, and during hot weather, ablution should be more  frequently practised. For a person in good health, a daily cold bath is  advisable. To this should be added occasionally a tepid bath, with soap,  water alone not being sufficient to remove impurities of a greasy nature.  Soap facilitates this, by forming with such substances a chemical mixture,  which is readily soluble in water, and is by it removed from the body. {48}    [Sidenote: 22. Liebig's maxim? What further is added?]    22. There is a maxim by the chemist Liebig, to the effect, that the  civilization of a nation is high, in proportion to the amount of soap that  it consumes; and that it is low, in proportion to its use of perfumes. In  some degree, we may apply the same test to the refinement of an individual.  The soap removes impurity; the perfume covers, while retaining it.    [Sidenote: 23. What is said about cold bathing?]    23. THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BATHS.--All persons are not alike able to use  the cold bath. When the health is vigorous, and the system does not feel a  shock after such a bath, a prompt reaction and glow upon the surface will  show that it is beneficial. Where this pleasurable feeling is not  experienced, but rather a chill and sense of depression ensues, we are  warned that the system will not, with impunity, endure cold bathing.    [Sidenote: 24. What is said about warm bathing?]    24. It should also be borne in mind, that the warm or hot bath cannot be  continued so long, or repeated so frequently as the cold, on account of the  enervating effect of unusual heat so applied to the body. For persons who  are not in robust health, one warm bath each week is sufficient; this class  should be careful to avoid every extreme in reference to bathing, clothing,  and whatever greatly affects the action of the skin.    [Sidenote: 25. What is said about sea-bathing?]    25. Sea-bathing is even more invigorating than fresh-water bathing. Those  who cannot endure the fresh water, are often benefited by the salt-water  baths. This may be accounted for, in part, by the stimulant action upon the  surface, of the saline particles of the sea-water; but the exciting scenes  and circumstances of sea-bathing also exert an important influence. The  open-air exercise, the rolling surf, the genial weather, and usually the  cheerful company, add to its intrinsic benefits. {49}    [Sidenote: 26. What is said as to the time and manner of bathing?]    26. TIME AND MANNER OF BATHING.--A person in sound health may take a bath  at almost any time, except directly after a full meal. The most appropriate  time is about three hours after a meal, the noon-hour being probably the  best. For the cold bath, taken rapidly, no time is better than immediately  after rising. Those beginning the use of cold baths should first try them  at 70deg Fahr., and gradually use those of a lower temperature. From five  to twenty minutes may be considered the proper limit of time to remain in a  bath; but a sensation of chilliness is a signal to withdraw instantly,  whether at home, or at the sea-side. Two sea-baths may be taken daily; one  of any other kind is sufficient.    [Sidenote: 27. Condition of the body when bathing? Direction, after  bathing?]    27. The body should be warm, rather than cold, when stepping into the bath;  and after it, the skin should be thoroughly dried with a coarse towel. It  is best to continue friction until there is a sensation of warmth or \"glow\"  throughout the entire surface. This reaction is the test of the good  effects of the bath. If reaction is still incomplete, a short walk may be  taken, especially in the sunshine. It is very congenial, however, both to  health and comfort, to rest for a short time directly after bathing, or to  take some light refreshment. This is better than severe exercise or a full  meal.    [Sidenote: 28. Bathing among the ancients? Baths of Rome?]    28. BATHING AMONG THE ANCIENTS.--The Romans and other nations of antiquity  made great use of the vapor-bath as a means of preserving the health, but  more particularly as a luxury. Their method was not unlike that employed in  northern Europe at the present day. The public baths of Rome and other  cities are among the grandest and most interesting monuments of ancient  luxury and splendor; and from their ruins have been recovered some of the  most beautiful works of art. {50}    [Sidenote: 29. After the bath? Swimming among the ancients?]    29. The Thermae, as the baths of Rome were called, were of great extent,  built very substantially, and ornamented at vast expense. They were  practically free to all, the cost of a bath having been less than a cent.  It is related that some persons bathed seven times a day. After the bath  their bodies were anointed with"]]]
