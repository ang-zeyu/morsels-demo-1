The Cooper hawk (_Accipiter cooperii_)  has been recorded nesting in this hickory. In dead trees of this  species that are still standing, the interiors may decay more rapidly  than the armorlike bark plates. On several occasions tufted titmice  and chickadees have been recorded as nesting in such cavities.      #Quercus stellata.#--Post oak is relatively scarce on the Reservation.  One area of approximately an acre on a south slope is dominated by it.  There are several other small groves and scattered trees. All are on  moderately steep south slopes in poor soil. Trees often found  associated with it include red elm, chestnut oak, chinquapin oak,  blackjack oak, hickory, and dogwood. It seems likely that under  original conditions this species occupied about the same area as it  does at present. It is not spreading, and there are few young trees  anywhere on the area. In every instance the groves are limited to a  rocky clay soil, and edaphic factors obviously are of major  importance. Under original conditions fire was probably a limiting  factor, and at the present time competition with other hardwoods may  be even more important.      #Quercus macrocarpa.#--Less than a dozen individuals of mossycup oak  have been noticed on the area, at well scattered points. Under  original conditions, it probably grew chiefly in the bottomlands that  have been completely cleared of timber for cultivation. The few now  present are all on hillsides, and are medium to large trees.      #Quercus Muehlenbergii.#--Chestnut oak was perhaps the one most  important tree species of the original climax forest on the area.  Because of its slow growth, scanty seed production, and large heavy  fruits with seeds lacking effective dispersal mechanisms, it has lost  ground to other kinds of trees as a result of the unnatural  disturbances which have occurred.    It still dominates on rocky upper slopes that have north, east or west  exposures and forms nearly pure stands in limited areas. Nearly all  the larger trees of this species now present have been cut one or more  times and have regenerated from stump sprouts. Seedlings and young  saplings of this oak are scarce even in parts of the woodland where  the species is most common. It is evident that reproduction is slow,  at least under present conditions. On the lower hill slopes these oaks  are scarce and scattered, but some of the largest are in such  situations. Chestnut oak seems to be relatively resistant to drought.  In the summer of 1954 when elms, and especially black oaks of all  sizes were dying in large numbers, the chestnut oaks growing among  them showed little evidence of injury in mature trees and only a small  percentage of mortality in saplings.      [Illustration: Fig. 5. Map of Reservation showing present        distribution of chestnut oak (shaded). The species is not        spreading  and is thought to be largely confined to the area        that was wooded  before 1860. Except in minor details,        shagbark hickory conforms to  the same distribution pattern        on this area.]    Chestnut oak has a relatively slow growth rate. In 17 that were  recorded, there were, on the average, 4.59 annual rings per inch of  trunk diameter. Near Pigeon Lake, Miami County, Kansas, counts were  obtained from five cut in 1952 from a virgin stand in a habitat  similar to that on the Reservation. The five trees had trunk diameters  of 16-1/2 to 25 inches and ranged in age from 65 to 183 years. Several  still growing on the Reservation are larger and presumably are well  over 100 years old.    As this oak seems to be in process of being replaced by other trees,  is slow-growing, and slow in dispersal, it seems probable that the  areas now occupied by its stands supported stands of it under  original conditions. Whether it can regain dominance under present  conditions of protection from cutting, fire and grazing remains to be  seen.    The chestnut oak produces a mast crop which is utilized by many kinds  of animals. Fox squirrels, gray squirrels, and white-footed mice feed  upon the acorns and store them. Blue jays, red-headed woodpeckers  (_Melanerpes erythrocephalus_), and red-bellied woodpeckers also eat  them. The red-eyed vireo, summer tanager and tufted titmouse are among  the birds that most frequently forage for insect food in chestnut  oaks. Relatively few kinds of birds seem to use this tree as a nest  site.      #Quercus prinoides.#--The chinquapin oak on this area is a small  shrubby tree, usually not more than 15 feet high and more typically  only six to eight feet. It occurs chiefly in dry rocky situations  along hilltop edges and upper slopes, usually where the slope exposure  is at least partly to the south. In such situations it may grow in  nearly pure stands. Often it is associated with dogwood. The trunks  are usually two to four inches in diameter, gnarled and twisted. The  crowns are dense and spreading.    This oak is the dominant plant in certain small areas of its preferred  habitat. In other areas of hilltop edge and upper slope it is being  eliminated by stands of hickory, chestnut oak, black oak and elm,  which shade it out. The species is tolerant of moderate to heavy  browsing, but seemingly can be eliminated by more intensive  utilization; even the higher foliage is often within reach of  livestock. In \"Horse Woods\" one of the hillside areas that was open to  livestock until 1949, this oak was almost absent, but it was abundant  in adjoining parts of the woods that were fenced in the thirties to  exclude livestock.    The thickets formed by this shrubby oak are frequented by cottontails,  which feed upon the bark and foliage. The small acorns are used as  food by rodents, especially the white-footed mouse. On several  occasions, in winter, groups of long-eared owls (_Asio otus_) have  been found roosting in thickets of chinquapin oak. Crows also utilize  these thickets for roosting occasionally. The white-eyed vireo (_Vireo  griseus_), gnatcatcher (_Polioptila caerulea_), and tufted titmouse,  frequent the oak thickets.      #Quercus rubra.#--The red oak is one of the important climax species  of the area. At present it is largely confined to a ravine in the  northeastern part of the section. The woodland here is less disturbed  than on most other parts of the Reservation, and red oak is the  dominant species. There are large trees, rather evenly distributed,  growing on east-facing and west-facing slopes. Just east of the  Reservation, in the \"Wall Creek\" area, the small valley on either side  of the creek and the adjacent lower slopes are dominated by giant red  oaks larger than any now growing on the Reservation. Farther up the  slope in the area of limestone outcrops, dominance shifts to chestnut  oak. That red oaks of similar size, and even larger, formerly occurred  on the Reservation, at least in the area still dominated by the  species, is shown by the presence of a stump 49 inches in diameter,  now in an advanced state of decay.      [Illustration: Fig. 6. Map of Reservation showing present        distribution of black oak (smaller dots) and red oak (larger        dots). Neither species is spreading and both are thought to        be largely  confined to the area that was wooded before 1860.]    The large acorns of the red oak are a favorite food of the gray  squirrel, which is most numerous on the parts of the Reservation where  these trees are present. The red-headed woodpecker on the area tends  to concentrate its activities where there are red oaks. The fox  squirrel, white-footed mouse, and blue jay are important consumers of  the acorns of red oak. A pair of barred owls resided in the deep woods  formed by these oaks and the associated trees.      #Quercus velutina.#--Black oak is one of the dominant species of the  original forest climax, and is still one of the more important trees  of the woodland. Like chestnut oak it shows little tendency to spread  beyond its present limits. Wherever there are small trees there are  old mature trees or remains of them nearby. For this reason the  present distribution of black oak on the area is thought to fall  entirely within the area occupied by the original forest. At present  it occurs throughout most of the woodland except in the warmer and  drier situations, such as on south slopes. In some hilltop situations  it is common, with occasional large mature trees. In some parts of the  bottomland and lower slopes it is abundant also, but there are  scarcely any on the upper dry rocky slopes that are the preferred  habitat of chestnut oak.    Growth in the black oak is somewhat more rapid than in the chestnut  oak, as the black oak usually grows on better soil. For 15 the average  growth amounted to 3.21 annual rings per inch of trunk diameter.    In 1954 a study of annual rings in a large, long dead, black oak at  the bottom of a north slope near the Reservation headquarters showed  that the tree was 96 years old, and hence was growing before the area  was settled. Within the period of this study black oak underwent  reduction in numbers more severe than that noted in any other species  of tree on the Reservation. The effect of drought may have been the  primary factor, although undoubtedly disease was involved also. In  1953, the second successive drought year, mortality was noticeable.  Precipitation continued below normal until August 1954. By then the  oaks had been decimated. On a sample strip of hilltop where 29 were  recorded, 21 had recently succumbed, and their leaves were dry and  withered; two were dying, though still having some green foliage, and  only six were surviving, all evidently in critical condition. The  mortality included trees of all sizes, even the largest and oldest. No  further mortality was noted in 1955"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34376"],[0,"Our Domestic Birds: Elementary Lessons in Aviculture (#8)"],[1,"other. If she finds a choice morsel of  food, a rapid clicking sound calls them about her. When she settles down  to brood them she calls them with a peculiar crooning note. The male  also cackles when alarmed, and when he finds food calls his mates in the  same way that the female calls her young under the same circumstances.  Other poultry and sometimes even cats and dogs learn this call and  respond to it. If the food discovered is something that a stronger  animal wants, the bird making the call may lose it because of his  eagerness to share the treasure with the members of his family.    In adult fowls the male and female are readily distinguished by  differences in appearance as well as by the voice. The comb and wattles  of the male are larger, and after he has completed his growth are always  of the same size and a bright red in color. In the female the comb is  much smaller than that of a male of the same family, and both size and  color vary periodically, the comb and wattles being larger and the whole  head brighter in color when the female is laying. The tail of the male  is also much larger than that of the female and has long plumelike  coverts. The feathers of his back and neck are long, narrow, and  flowing, and in many varieties are much brighter in color than the  corresponding feathers on the female. The male has a short, sharp spur  on the inside of each leg, a little above the hind toe. Occasionally a  female has spurs, but they are usually very small. With so many  differences between male and female the sex of an adult fowl is apparent  at a glance. In the young of breeds which have large combs the males  begin to grow combs when quite small, and so the sex may be known when  they are only a few weeks old. In other breeds the sex may not be  distinguished with certainty until the birds are several months old, or,  in some cases, until they are nearly full-grown.    [Illustration: Fig. 15. White Polish male (crowing) and female.  (Photograph from Leontine Lincoln Jr., Fall River, Massachusetts)]    The adult male fowl is called a _cock_, and also, in popular phrase, a  _rooster_. The adult female fowl is called a _hen_. The word \"hen\" is  the feminine form of _hana_, the Anglo-Saxon name for the cock. It is  likely that the name \"cock,\" which it is plain was taken from the first  syllable of the crow of the bird, was gradually substituted for _hana_  because it is shorter. _Hana_ means \"the singer.\" A young fowl is called  a _chicken_ until the sex can be distinguished. After that poultry  fanciers call the young male a _cockerel_ and the young female a  _pullet_. The word \"pullet\" is also used by others, but the popular  names for a cockerel are _crower_ and _young rooster_. The word  \"cockerel,\" as is seen at a glance, is the diminutive of \"cock.\" The  word \"pullet,\" sometimes spelled _poulet_, is a diminutive from the  French _poule_, \"a hen.\"    =Origin of the fowl.= Of the origin of the fowl we have no direct  knowledge. It was fully domesticated long before the beginnings of  history. There is no true wild race of fowls known. For a long time it  was commonly held that the _Gallus Bankiva_, found in the jungles of  India, was the ancestor of all the races of the domestic fowl, but this  view was not accepted by some of the most careful investigators, and the  most recent inquiries into the subject indicate that the so-called  _Gallus Bankiva_ is not a native wild species but a feral race, that is,  a race developed in the wild from individuals escaped from  domestication.    =Appearance of the original wild species.= The likeness of the fowls  shown in ancient drawings to the ordinary unimproved stock in many parts  of the world to-day shows that--except as by special breeding men have  developed distinct races--fowls have not changed since the most remote  times of which records exist. From the constancy of this type through  this long period it is reasonably inferred that no marked change in the  size and shape of the fowl had occurred in domestication in prehistoric  times, and therefore that the original wild fowl very closely resembled  fowls which may be seen wherever the influence of improved races has not  changed the ordinary type. The particular point in which the wild  species differed from a flock of ordinary domestic fowls was color.  Domestic fowls, unless carefully bred for one color type, are usually of  many colors. In the wild species, as a rule, only one color would be  found, and that would be brown, which is the prevailing color among  small land birds.    =Distribution of fowls in ancient times.= From drawings and  descriptions on ancient tablets and from figures on old coins it appears  that the fowl was familiar to the Babylonians seven thousand years ago,  and that it was introduced into Egypt about 4600 B.C. Chinese tradition  gives 1400 B.C. as the approximate date of the introduction of poultry  into China from the West. At the time of the founding of Rome the fowl  was well known throughout Northern Africa, and in the Mediterranean  countries of Europe as far west as Italy and Sicily. It was also known  in Japan at this time. Whether it was known in India is uncertain; if  not, it was brought there soon after. It is supposed that immediately  following their conquests in Central and Western Europe the Romans  introduced their poultry into those regions. Thus, at about the  beginning of the Christian Era, the fowl was known to all the civilized  peoples of the Old World and had been introduced to the less civilized  races of Europe.    [Illustration: Fig. 16. Light Brahma cockerel]    =Development of principal races of fowls.= There is no evidence that any  of the ancient civilized peoples made any effort to improve the fowl,  nor have any improved races been produced in the lands where those  civilizations flourished. Outside of this area many different types were  gradually developed to suit the needs or the tastes of people in  different countries and localities. Thus in the course of centuries were  produced from the same original wild stock fowls as unlike as the  massive Brahma, with feathered legs and feet, and the diminutive Game  Bantam; the Leghorn, with its large comb, and the Polish, with only the  rudiments of a comb and in its place a great ball of feathers; the  Spanish, with monstrous development of the skin of the face, and the  Silky, with dark skin and hairlike plumage. Except in a few limited  districts these special types did not displace the ordinary type for  many centuries. Until modern times they were hardly known outside of the  districts or the countries where they originated. Of the details of  their origin nothing is known. They were not of the highly specialized  and finished types such as are bred by fanciers now. Their distinctive  features had been established, but in comparatively crude form. The  refining and perfecting of all these types has been the work of fanciers  in Holland, Belgium, England, and America in modern times. These  fanciers have also developed new races of more serviceable types.    [Illustration: Fig. 17. Light Brahma hen]    [Illustration: Fig. 18. Red Pile Game Bantam cock]    [Illustration: Fig. 19. Red Pile Game Bantam hen]    =How fowls were kept in old times.= Less than a century ago it was  quite a common practice among the cottagers of England and Scotland to  keep their fowls in their cottages at night. Sometimes a loft, to which  the birds had access by a ladder outside, was fitted up for them.  Sometimes perches for the fowls were put in the living room of the  cottage. Such practices seem to us wrong from a sanitary standpoint, but  it is only within very recent times that people have given careful  attention to sanitation, and in old times, when petty thieving was more  common than it is now, there was a decided advantage in having such  small domestic animals as poultry and pigs where they could not be  disturbed without the owner's knowing it. The practice of keeping fowls  in the owner's dwelling seems to have been confined to the poorer  people, who had no large domestic animals for which they must provide  suitable outbuildings. On large farms special houses were sometimes  provided for poultry, but they were probably oftener housed with other  animals, for few people thought it worth while to give them special  attention.    [Illustration: Fig. 20. White-Faced Black Spanish cockerel. (Photograph  from R. A. Rowan, Los Angeles, California)]    Throughout all times and in all lands the common domestic birds have  usually been the special charge of the women and children of a  household. In some countries long-established custom makes the poultry  the personal property of the wife. A traveler in Nubia about seventy  years ago states that there the henhouse, as well as the hens, belonged  to the wife, and if a man divorced his wife, as the custom permitted,  she took all away with her.    [Illustration: Fig. 21. Silver-Spangled Polish cock and hen. (Photograph  from Leontine Lincoln Jr., Fall River, Massachusetts)]    The flocks of fowls were usually small in old times. It was only in  areas adjacent to large cities that a surplus of poultry or eggs could  be disposed of profitably, and as the fowls were almost always allowed  the run of the dooryard, the barnyard, and the outbuildings, the number  that could be tolerated, even on a large farm, was limited. As a rule  the fowls were expected to get their living as they could, but in this  they were not so much worse off than other live stock, or than their  owners. But, while this was the ordinary state of the family flock of  fowls, there were frequent exceptions. The housewife who is thrifty  always manages affairs about the house better than the majority of her  neighbors, and in older poultry literature there are occasional  statements of the methods of those who were most successful with their  fowls, which we may well suppose"]]]
