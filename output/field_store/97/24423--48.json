But after the fall of the kingly power, the patricians, having become  more powerful, determined to preserve the lands which they had unjustly  seized.[130]    And it must be acknowledged, as they supported the greatest share of the  burthen of war and taxation, they had a better claim than the others to  the conquered lands; they thought, moreover, that the colonies were  sufficient to support an agricultural population, and they acted rather  as State farmers than as proprietors of the soil. According to the  public law, indeed, the _ager publicus_ was inalienable, and we read in  an ancient author:--\"Lawyers deny that the soil which has once begun to  belong to the Roman people, can ever, by usage or possession, become  the property of anybody else in the world.\"[131]    In spite of this principle, it would have been wisdom to give, to the  poor citizens who had fought, a part of the spoils of the vanquished;  for the demands were incessant, and after 268, renewed almost yearly by  the tribunes or by the consuls themselves. In 275, a patrician, Fabius  Caeso, taking the initiative in a partition of lands recently conquered,  exclaimed: \"Is it not just that the territories taken from the enemy  should become the property of those who have paid for it with their  sweat and with their blood?\"[132] The Senate was as inflexible for this  proposition as for those which were brought forward by Q. Considius and  T. Genucius in 278, by Cn. Genucius in 280, and by the tribunes of the  people, with the support of the consuls Valerius and AEmilius, in  284.[133]    Yet, after fifty years of struggles since the expulsion of the Tarquins,  the tribune Icilius, in 298, obtained the partition of the lands of  Mount Aventine, by indemnifying those who had usurped a certain portion  of them.[134] The application of the law Icilia to other parts of the  _ager publicus_[135] was vainly solicited in 298 and the following  years; but in 330, a new tax was imposed upon the possessors of the  lands for the pay of the troops. The perseverance of the tribunes was  unwearied, and, during the thirty-six years following, six different  propositions were unsuccessful, even that relating to the territory of  the Bolani, newly taken from the enemy.[136] In 361 only, a senatus  consultus granted to each father of a family and to each free man seven  acres of the territory which had just been conquered from the Veii.[137]  In 371, after a resistance of five years, the Senate, in order to secure  the concurrence of the people in the war against the Volsci, agreed to  the partition of the territory of the Pomptinum (the Pontine Marshes),  taken from that people by Camillus, and already given up to the  encroachments of the aristocracy.[138] But these partial concessions  were not enough to satisfy the plebeians or to repair past injustices;  in the Licinian law the claims of the people, which had been resisted  during a hundred and thirty-six years, triumphed;[139] it did not  entirely deprive the nobles of the enjoyment of the lands unjustly  usurped, but it limited the possession of them to five hundred _jugera_.  When this repartition was made, the land which remained was to be  distributed among the poor. The proprietors were obliged to maintain on  their lands a certain number of free men, in order to augment the class  from which the legions were recruited; lastly, the number of cattle on  each domain was fixed, in order to restrain the culture of the meadows,  in general the most lucrative, and augment that of the arable lands,  which relieved Italy from the necessity of having recourse to foreign  corn.    This law of Licinius Stolo secured happy results; it restrained the  encroachments of the rich and great, but only proceeded with moderation  in its retrospective effects; it put a stop to the alarming extension of  the private domains at the expense of the public domain, to the  absorption of the good of the many by the few, to the depopulation of  Italy, and consequently to the diminution of the strength of the  armies.[140]    The numerous condemnations for trespasses against the law Licinia prove  that it was carried into execution, and for the space of two hundred  years it contributed, with the establishment of new colonies,[141] to  maintain this class of agriculturists--the principal sinews of the  State. We see indeed that, from this moment, the Senate itself took the  initiative of new distributions of land to the people.[142]    DEBTS.--The question of debts and the diminution of the rate of interest  had long been the subject of strong prejudices and of passionate  debates.    As the citizens made war at their own expense, the less rich, while they  were under arms, could not take care of their fields or farms, but  borrowed money to provide for their wants and for those of their  families. The debt had, in this case, a noble origin, the service of  their country.[143] Public opinion must, therefore, be favourable to the  debtors and hostile to those who, speculating on the pecuniary  difficulties of the defenders of the State, extorted heavy interest for  the money they lent. The patricians also took advantage of their  position and their knowledge of legal forms to exact heavy sums from the  plebeians whose causes they defended.[144]    The kings, listening to the demands of the citizens who were overwhelmed  with debts, often showed their readiness to help them;[145] but, after  their expulsion, the rich classes, more independent, became more  untractable, and men, ruined on account of their military service, were  sold publicly, as slaves,[146] by their creditors. Thus, when war was  imminent, the poor often refused to serve,[147] crying out, \"What use  will it be to us to conquer the enemies without, if our creditors put us  in bonds for the debts we have contracted? What advantage shall we have  in strengthening the empire of Rome, if we cannot preserve our personal  liberty?\"[148] Yet the patricians, who contributed more than the others  to the costs of the war, demanded of their debtors, not without reason,  the payment of the money they had advanced; and hence arose perpetual  dissensions.[149]    In 305, the laws of the Twelve Tables decided that the rate of interest  should be reduced to ten per cent. a year; but a law of Licinius Stolo  alone resolved, in an equitable manner, this grave question. It enacted  that the interests previously paid should be deducted from the  principal, and that the principal should be repaid by equal portions  during an interval of three years. This measure was advantageous to all,  for, in the state of insolvency in which the debtors were involved, the  creditors could not obtain the interest of their money, and even risked  the loss of the principal; the new law guaranteed the debts; the debtors  in their turn, having become landed proprietors, found the means of  freeing themselves by means of the lands they had received and the delay  which had been given them. The agreement established in 387 was of  slight duration, and in the midst of disagreements more or less violent,  things were carried so far, in 412, that the entire abolition of debts  and the prohibition to exact any interest were decreed mere  revolutionary and transitory measures.      [Sidenote: Resume.]    V. This rapid sketch of the evils already perceptible which tormented  Roman society leads us to this reflection: it is the lot of all  governments, whatever be their form, to contain within themselves germs  of life, which make their strength, and germs of dissolution, which must  some day lead to their ruin; and accordingly, as the Republic was in  progress or in decline, the first or the second became developed and  dominant in turn; that is, so long as the aristocracy preserved its  virtues and its patriotism, the elements of prosperity predominated; but  no sooner did it begin to degenerate, than the causes of disturbance  gained the upper hand, and shook the edifice which had been erected so  laboriously.    If the fall of the kingly power, in giving more vitality and  independence to the aristocracy, rendered the constitution of the State  more solid and durable, the democracy had at first no reason for  congratulation. Two hundred years passed away before the plebeians could  obtain, not equality of political rights, but even a share in the _ager  publicus_ and an act of lenity in favour of debtors, overwhelmed with  liabilities through incessant wars. About the same length of time was  required by the Republic to re-conquer the supremacy over the  neighbouring peoples which she had exercised under the last kings,[150]  so many years a country requires to recover from the shocks and  enfeebling influence of even the most legitimate revolutions.    Yet Roman society had been vigorously enough constituted to resist at  the same time external attacks and internal troubles. Neither the  invasions of Porsenna, nor those of the Gauls, nor the conspiracies of  the neighbouring peoples, were able to compromise its existence. Already  eminent men, such as Valerius Publicola, A. Postumius, Coriolanus,  Spurius Cassius, Cincinnatus, and Camillus, had distinguished themselves  as legislators and warriors, and Rome could put on foot ten legions, or  forty-five thousand men. At home, important advantages had been  obtained, and notable concessions had been made to effect a  reconciliation between the two orders; written laws had been adopted,  and the attributes of the different magistracies had been better  defined, but the constitution of society remained the same. The facility  granted to the plebeians of arriving at all the State employments only "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],[0,"The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#8)"],[1,"to conclude that these      suns are girt round by dependent systems of worlds. Though we      cannot, as in the case of the solar system, actual see such worlds,      yet the mind presents them before us, various in size, various      in structure, infinitely various in their physical condition and      habitudes.[A]    [Footnote A: \"Other Worlds Than Ours,\" p. 240.]    With the unaided eye there is ordinarily within the range of our vision  some five or six thousand of these \"fixed stars.\" With the aid of the  telescope, however, there is brought within the range of man's vision  between forty and fifty millions of fixed stars; with the probability  existing that all these, as well as those fixed stars of sufficient  magnitude to be within the range of our unaided vision, are, like our  own sun, the centers of groups of opaque planets, which, because they  are opaque, cannot be seen by us. But this is but the beginning of the  story of the universe. Immense as are the numbers of \"fixed stars\" to  which I have called attention, and their distances so great that in  some cases it would take a ray of light a million years to reach us  from them, though light moves through space at such speed that it will  travel some eight times around the earth in a single second--immense,  I say, as are these numbers of \"fixed stars\" revealed to man by the  telescope, they are after all but as the first \"street lamps\" of  God's great universe--but a few of the motes in God's sunbeam. Let me  explain. You have seen a ray of sunlight dart into a room through the  half drawn curtains, and have observed that it reveals the existence  of innumerable motes floating about in the sunbeam. You know that if  the sunbeam should shift into another part of the room it will reveal  the existence of motes in that part of the room also--millions of  them. So you know that the atmosphere in the whole room is filled  with such motes; that the atmosphere in every room in your house is  in the same condition--that is, filled with motes; so all the rooms  in all the houses of your friends, or in the city; so also the whole  circumambient air of the whole earth. Well, what man has discovered in  space pertaining to the existence of \"fixed stars\"--great, selfluminous  bodies, unquestionably the centers of planetary systems the same as  our sun is--all this, I say, is but as the sunbeam revealing the  existence of a few of the motes that exist in some little corner of a  room: for out on the farthest edge of space explored by man's vision  aided by the most powerful helps he can devise, man in contemplation  can stand and conceive of still greater stretches of space filled by  still more numerous suns, the centers of planetary systems, than has  yet come within the range of his vision. And standing thus in the midst  of the universe, he begins to comprehend that great truth uttered by  Joseph Smith when he contemplated the creations of the Gods: \"There  is no space where there is no kingdom [created world], and there is  no kingdom where there is no space, either a greater or a lesser  space.\"[A] But this is beside the subject.    [Footnote A: Doc. & Cov. sec. 88:36,37.]    What I want you to do is to think how small and insignificant this  earth of ours is, even in comparison with some of the planets of  our own system, some of which are hundreds of times larger than our  earth.[A] And then the sun, the center of the system, itself--what a  speck it is in the universe! Though outweighing the combined mass of  all the planets of which he is the center seven hundred and thirty  times over, still he is but a point in the universe! To quote the words  of an eminent author:    [Footnote A: The planet Jupiter, for example, has a diameter of about  85,000 miles, while the earth's diameter is but about 8,000 miles. In  volume Jupiter exceeds our earth about 1,300 times, while in mass it  exceeds it 213 times. (See \"Newcomb's Astronomy,\" p. 339.)]          As there are other globes like our earth, so, too, there are      other worlds like our solar system. There are self-luminous suns      exceeding in number all computation. The dimensions of this earth      pass into nothingness in comparison with the dimensions of the      solar system, and that system, in its turn, is only an invisible      point if placed in relation with the countless hosts of other      systems which form, with it, clusters of stars. Our solar system,      far from being alone in the universe, is only one of an extensive      brotherhood, bound by common laws and subject to like influences.      Even on the very verge of creation, where imagination might lay the      beginning of the realms of chaos, we see unbounded proofs of order,      a regularity in the arrangement of inanimate things, suggesting      to us that there are other intellectual creatures like us, the      tenants of those islands in the abysses of space. Though it may      take a beam of light a million of years to bring to our view those      distant worlds, the end is not yet. Far away in the depths of space      we catch the faint gleams of other groups of stars like our own.      The finger of a man can hide them in their remoteness. Their vast      distances from one another have dwindled into nothing. They and      their movements have lost all individuality; the innumerable suns      of which they are composed blend all their collected lights into      one pale milky glow.        Thus extending our view from the earth to the solar system, from      the solar system to the expanse of the group of stars to which we      belong, we behold a series of gigantic nebular creations rising      up one above another, and forming greater and greater colonies of      worlds. No numbers can express them, for they make the firmament      a haze of stars. Uniformity, even though it be the uniformity of      magnificence, tires at last, and we abandon the survey, for our      eyes can only behold a boundless prospect and conscience tells us      our own unspeakable insignificance.[A]    [Footnote A: Draper's \"Intellectual Development of Europe,\" vol. 2, p.  292.]    And the earth itself, then, what of that? What an insignificant thing  it is in the creations of God! With all its islands and continents, its  rivers, lakes and mighty oceans; its mountains and its valleys; its  towns, cities and all the tribes of men, together with all their hopes  and fears and petty ambitions--all is but a mote in God's sunbeam--less  than a single grain of sand on the sea shore!    What I want to ask in the light of these reflections is this: Is it  such a wonderful thing to believe that at the last, one of God's sons  shall preside over this little earth as the God-president or God of it?  That our Father Adam, the \"Grand Patriarch\" of our race--the \"Ancient  of Days\"--\"Michael, the Archangel\"--give him what title you will out  of the many which are his--is it so hard to believe that he will  eventually attain to the dignity of the governorship of this earth,  when it is redeemed and sanctified and becomes one of the glorified  spheres of God?    Some of the sectarian ministers are saying that we \"Mormons\" are  ashamed of the doctrine announced by President Brigham Young to the  effect that Adam will thus be the God of this world. No, friends, it is  not that we are ashamed of that doctrine. If you see any change come  over our countenances when this doctrine is named, it is surprise,  astonishment, that any one at all capable of grasping the largeness and  extent of the universe--the grandeur of existence and the possibilities  in man for growth, for progress, should be so lean of intellect, should  have such a paucity of understanding, as to call it in question at  all. That is what our change of countenance means--not shame for the  doctrine Brigham Young taught.    I feel that I must have wearied you with so long a discourse; I know  very well I have wearied myself; and yet I am loth to quit this  splendid field for thought. The subject, and our conception of it,  must ever be grander than it is within our ability to express. It is  beyond our power to grasp it and make it plain in words, I can see in  this \"Mormon\" doctrine of God the highest spirituality that the mind  of man is capable of grasping. If our sectarian friends think, that in  us there is any drifting away from the teachings of our prophets upon  this subject, any shadow of turning, and that we of modern days are  growing more spiritual than were they, it is not that we are changing,  or leaving the old moorings of our faith; but it is because they  themselves are giving a little more careful attention to our doctrines,  and begin to catch their first sight of the grand spirituality which  all the while has pervaded our belief in the Gods and their government,  and the heights of glory to which men--the offspring of the Gods--may  finally attain.
