The remaining man was one  Turner, of a very powerful frame, who was doing camp duty as cook on  this eventful morning. When the Indians rushed upon him he defended  himself with a huge firebrand, or half-burnt poplar stick, with which he  laid about him like Sampson, killing four red-skins before he saw a  chance of escape. Singularly, for one in his extremity, he did escape,  and also arrived at Vancouver that winter.    Dr. McLaughlin received the unlucky trader and his three surviving men  with every mark and expression of kindness, and entertained them through  the winter. Not only this, but he dispatched a strong, armed party to  the scene of the disaster to punish the Indians and recover the stolen  goods; all of which was done at his own expense, both as an act of  friendship toward his American rivals, and as necessary to the  discipline which they everywhere maintained among the Indians. Should  this offence go unpunished, the next attack might be upon one of his own  parties going annually down into California. Sir George Simpson, the  Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, chanced to be spending the winter  at Vancouver. He offered to send Smith to London the following summer,  in the Company's vessel, where he might dispose of his furs to  advantage; but Smith declined this offer, and finally sold his furs to  Dr. McLaughlin, and returned in the spring to the Rocky Mountains.    On Sublette's return from St. Louis, in the summer of 1829, with men and  merchandise for the year's trade, he became uneasy on account of Smith's  protracted absence. According to a previous plan, he took a large party  into the Snake River country to hunt. Among the recruits from St. Louis  was Joseph L. Meek, the subject of the narrative following this chapter.  Sublette not meeting with Smith's party on its way from the Columbia, as  he still hoped, at length detailed a party to look for him on the  head-waters of the Snake. Meek was one of the men sent to look for the  missing partner, whom he discovered at length in Pierre's Hole, a deep  valley in the mountains, from which issues the Snake River in many  living streams. Smith returned with the men to camp, where the tale of  his disasters was received after the manner of mountain-men, simply  declaring with a momentarily sobered countenance, that their comrade has  not been \"in luck;\" with which brief and equivocal expression of  sympathy the subject is dismissed. To dwell on the dangers incident to  their calling would be to half disarm themselves of their necessary  courage; and it is only when they are gathered about the fire in their  winter camp, that they indulge in tales of wild adventure and  \"hair-breadth 'scapes,\" or make sorrowful reference to a comrade lost.    Influenced by the hospitable treatment which Smith had received at the  hands of the Hudson's Bay Company, the partners now determined to  withdraw from competition with them in the Snake country, and to trap  upon the waters of the Colorado, in the neighborhood of their fort. But  \"luck,\" the mountain-man's Providence, seemed to have deserted Smith. In  crossing the Colorado River with a considerable collection of skins, he  was again attacked by Indians, and only escaped by losing all his  property. He then went to St. Louis for a supply of merchandise, and  fitted out a trading party for Santa Fe; but on his way to that place  was killed in an encounter with the savages.    Turner, the man who so valiantly wielded the firebrand on the Umpqua  River, several years later met with a similar adventure on the Rogue  River, in Southern Oregon, and was the means of saving the lives of his  party by his courage, strength, and alertness. He finally, when trapping  had become unprofitable, retired upon a farm in the Wallamet Valley, as  did many other mountain-men who survived the dangers of their perilous  trade.    After the death of Smith, the Rocky Mountain Fur Company continued its  operations under the command of Bridger, Fitzpatrick, and Milton  Sublette, brother of William. In the spring of 1830 they received about  two hundred recruits, and with little variation kept up their number of  three or four hundred men for a period of eight or ten years longer, or  until the beaver were hunted out of every nook and corner of the Rocky  Mountains.    Previous to 1835, there were in and about the Rocky Mountains, beside  the \"American\" and \"Rocky Mountain\" companies, the St. Louis Company,  and eight or ten \"lone traders.\" Among these latter were William  Sublette, Robert Campbell, J.O. Pattie, Mr. Pilcher, Col. Charles Bent,  St. Vrain, William Bent, Mr. Gant, and Mr. Blackwell. All these  companies and traders more or less frequently penetrated into the  countries of New Mexico, Old Mexico, Sonora, and California; returning  sometimes through the mountain regions of the latter State, by the  Humboldt River to the head-waters of the Colorado. Seldom, in all their  journeys, did they intrude on that portion of the Indian Territory lying  within three hundred miles of Fort Vancouver, or which forms the area of  the present State of Oregon.    Up to 1832, the fur trade in the West had been chiefly conducted by  merchants from the frontier cities, especially by those of St. Louis.  The old \"North American\" was the only exception. But in the spring of  this year, Captain Bonneville, an United States officer on furlough, led  a company of a hundred men, with a train of wagons, horses and mules,  with merchandise, into the trapping grounds of the Rocky Mountains. His  wagons were the first that had ever crossed the summit of these  mountains, though William Sublette had, two or three years previous,  brought wagons as far as the valley of the Wind River, on the east side  of the range. Captain Bonneville remained nearly three years in the  hunting and trapping grounds, taking parties of men into the Colorado,  Humboldt, and Sacramento valleys; but he realized no profits from his  expedition, being opposed and competed with by both British and American  traders of larger experience.    But Captain Bonneville's venture was a fortunate one compared with that  of Mr. Nathaniel Wyeth of Massachusetts, who also crossed the continent  in 1832, with the view of establishing a trade on the Columbia River.  Mr. Wyeth brought with him a small party of men, all inexperienced in  frontier or mountain life, and destined for a salmon fishery on the  Columbia. He had reached Independence, Missouri, the last station before  plunging into the wilderness, and found himself somewhat at a loss how  to proceed, until, at this juncture, he was overtaken by the party of  William Sublette, from St. Louis to the Rocky Mountains, with whom he  travelled in company to the rendezvous at Pierre's Hole.    When Wyeth arrived at the Columbia River, after tarrying until he had  acquired some mountain experiences, he found that his vessel, which was  loaded with merchandise for the Columbia River trade, had not arrived.  He remained at Vancouver through the winter, the guest of the Hudson's  Bay Company, and either having learned or surmised that his vessel was  wrecked, returned to the United States in the following year. Not  discouraged, however, he made another venture in 1834, despatching the  ship _May Dacre_, Captain Lambert, for the Columbia River, with another  cargo of Indian goods, traveling himself overland with a party of two  hundred men, and a considerable quantity of merchandise which he  expected to sell to the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. In this expectation  he was defeated by William Sublette, who had also brought out a large  assortment of goods for the Indian trade, and had sold out, supplying  the market, before Mr. Wyeth arrived.    Wyeth then built a post, named Fort Hall, on Snake River, at the  junction of the Portneuf, where he stored his goods, and having detached  most of his men in trapping parties, proceeded to the Columbia River to  meet the _May Dacre_. He reached the Columbia about the same time with  his vessel, and proceeded at once to erect a salmon fishery. To forward  this purpose he built a post, called Fort William, on the lower end of  Wappatoo (now known as Sauvie's) Island, near where the Lower Wallamet  falls into the Columbia. But for various reasons he found the business  on which he had entered unprofitable. He had much trouble with the  Indians, his men were killed or drowned, so that by the time he had half  a cargo of fish, he was ready to abandon the effort to establish a  commerce with the Oregon Indians, and was satisfied that no enterprise  less stupendous and powerful than that of the Hudson's Bay Company could  be long sustained in that country.    Much complaint was subsequently made by Americans, chiefly Missionaries,  of the conduct of that company in not allowing Mr. Wyeth to purchase  beaver skins of the Indians, but Mr. Wyeth himself made no such  complaint. Personally, he was treated with unvarying kindness, courtesy,  and hospitality. As a trader, they would not permit him to undersell  them. In truth, they no doubt wished him away; because competition would  soon ruin the business of either, and they liked not to have the Indians  taught to expect more than their furs were worth, nor to have the  Indians' confidence in themselves destroyed or tampered with.    The Hudson's Bay Company were hardly so unfriendly to him as the  American companies; since to the former he was enabled to sell his goods  and fort on the Snake River, before he returned to the United States,  which he did in 1835.    The sale of Fort Hall to the Hudson's Bay Company was a finishing blow  at the American fur trade in the Rocky Mountains, which after two or  three years of constantly declining profits, was entirely abandoned.

Our knowledge of these singular birds has been much increased by  the writings of Professor Temminck, who has described twelve species. The  present bird is nearly the smallest of its family: I found it only once in  the interior of Bahia in Brazil, where it must be very rare, or frequent to  particular districts only. Though differing in some respects from the  description of Temminck, I am inclined to consider it merely as a variety.    Total length (excepting the legs) eight inches and a quarter. The bill is  one inch one line long from the gape, and, with the irides, is red. The  head and neck above blackish cinereous; the crown much darker and tinged  with brown, the rest of the upper plumage uniform reddish-brown; the edges  of the wing-covers tinged with pale cinereous; the spurious wings and  quills greyish-brown; the chin is white, changing on the throat, neck,  breast and their sides to a pale lead-colour, which, on the body, again  becomes white; the feathers on the flanks are blackish or rufous,  beautifully margined all round by white, with another internal mark of the  same kind; those on the vent are similarly marked, but on a pale rufous  ground; the thighs are rufous-white; the under tail-covers rufous, marked  by narrow undulated concentric lines of black, the ends whitish.
