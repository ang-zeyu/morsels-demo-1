Some little business in the slave trade had been  done on the trip the summer before by our old guide, who was a regular  trader. Governor Young asked me something about this business, telling  me to look out, and if any of these traders came in, to let him know,  as the laws of the United States, which then extended over this  Territory, prohibited this business, and that it would be his duty to  put a stop to the same. He hoped to do this by advising these traders  in regard to the present conditions. When this party of traders spoken  of arrived. Governor Young was notified and came to Provo. The leaders  of this company came to see the governor, I acting as interpreter. Mr.  Young had the law read and explained to them, showing them that from  this on they were under obligations to observe the laws of the United  States instead of Mexico; that the treaty of Guadalupe de Hidalgo,  had changed the conditions, and that from this on they were under the  control of the United States. He further showed that it was a cruel  practice to enslave human beings, and explained that the results of  such a business caused war and bloodshed among the Indian tribes.    The Mexicans listened with respect, admitting that the traffic would  have to cease. It was plainly shown to them that it was a cruel  business which could not be tolerated any longer; but as it had been an  old established practice, they were not so much to blame for following  the traffic heretofore. Now it was expected that this business would be  discontinued.    All seemed satisfied and pledged their words that they would return  to their homes without trading for children. Most of them kept their  promise, but one small party, under Pedro Lion, violated their  obligations and were arrested and brought before the United States  court. Judge Snow presiding.    This was quite a noted case. I was employed as interpreter. George A.  Smith defended the prisoners, and Colonel Blair prosecuted with great  wisdom and tact, he knowing all about the Mexican character, having  been in the Texan war. A great deal of prejudice and bitter feeling  was manifested toward the Mexicans. Governor Young seeing this, used  all his influence that they might have a fair and impartial trial, and  the law be vindicated in a spirit of justice and not in the spirit of  persecution. The defence made by the Mexicans was that the Indians  had stolen a lot of horses from them and that they had followed and  overtaken them. On coming to their camp they found the Indians had  killed and eaten the horses. The only remuneration they could get was  to take some children which the Indians offered in payment, saying they  did not mean to break their promise. This defence had some weight,  whether true or not. Still they were found guilty and fined. The trial  lasted several days; the fines were afterwards remitted, and the  Mexicans allowed to return home. They had been delayed some time, and  made nothing on their trip. No doubt they felt sour, but considering  the law, they were dealt leniently with. This broke up the Indian slave  trade.    Stopping this slave business helped to sour some of Walker's band. They  were in the habit of raiding on the Pahutes and low tribes, taking  their children prisoners and selling them. Next year when they came  up and camped on the Provo bench, they had some Indian children for  sale. They offered them to the Mormons who declined buying. Arapine,  Walkers brother, became enraged saying that the Mormons had stopped the  Mexicans from buying these children; that they had no right to do so,  unless they bought them themselves. Several of us were present when he  took one of these children by the heels and dashed its brains out on  the hard ground, after which he threw the body towards us, telling us  we had no hearts, or we would have bought it and saved its life. This  was a strange argument, but it was the argument of an enraged savage.  I never heard of any successful attempts to buy children afterwards by  the Mexicans. If done at all it was secretly.        CHAPTER IX.    My Marriage--Peaceful Life Among the Savages--Dr. Bowman Seeks  Trouble-He is Killed by the Indians--The \"Walker War\"--Its Cause--A  Thrilling Situation.    On the 29th of January, 1852, Miss Harriet Emily Colton was united to  me in marriage. All I will say at present is, that her life and labors  are as much a part of mine as is possible for a wife's to be. She was  my heart's choice from first sight, and so continued till the day of  her death. We lived on a farm quite a distance from the settlement for  some time after our marriage. My wife's father, Philander Colton, went  to California the spring we were married, leaving me in charge of his  farm and affairs. The farm was near the Indian camping ground; hundreds  of them were often around us. Sometimes they were more or less saucy,  but we treated them kindly. My wife seemed to have the same spirit as  myself in regard to the Indians, feeling friendly towards them and  wishing to see them taught and helped out of their degraded condition.    Nothing occurred in my experience during the remainder of the year  worth recording. All of the Indians around were friendly toward us, but  frequently spoke of being dissatisfied with the treatment received from  some others. Many will say, and with some truthfulness, that Indians  visit their revenge upon whites indiscriminately. Yet if one treats  them so as to get their real friendship, they are not apt to harm him.    I went as interpreter for President Young in the spring of 1853, to  Sanpete county, where some disturbance was threatened by Mexicans under  the leadership of a certain Dr. Bowman from New Mexico who seemed  inclined to make himself a name by committing some violent act in  defiance of law. There seemed to be a determination on his part and  those with him to revive the slave trade. He threatened anyone that  might interfere with him, saying he could bring all the Indians in the  mountains to help him. I was acquainted with this man while in New  Mexico. I met him while on a trip to Sanpete valley a few days before  I went with President Young's party. The moment Bowman saw me he began  to curse me for being a Mormon, saying he had power at his back to use  all the Mormons up. I felt some little friendship for him as is natural  for me to feel for anyone I have formerly known, and advised him to act  more careful, or he would get into trouble. I tried to reason with him,  but to no purpose, he went on down to Utah valley and there acted in  an insulting and threatening manner. Bowman's Mexicans were encamped  on the west side of the Sanpete valley. It was deemed prudent to bring  them in and keep an eye on them, until it could be decided what their  intentions were, for at this time it was seen that a growing spirit of  war was upon the Indians, and almost anything would stir them up.    Several little fusses of a private nature had lately occurred.    At this time many of the settlers, contrary to the counsel of President  Young, had settled on farms and were much exposed. This had a  tendency to make the Indians aggressive. Many times the settlers were  sorely annoyed by the Indians' horses getting into the fields. When  remonstrated with they would ask, \"Whose lands are these you are on.\"  The continual advice of President Young was to build in towns, fence  their lands and be kind to the Indians; that it was cheaper to feed  than to fight them, etc. Some heeded this counsel, while many did not.    I was one of a party of four or five who went out and brought in the  Mexicans. They were a little suspicious, asking a great many questions  about Bowman, where he was, etc. But I finally persuaded them to  go with us. We had no authority to arrest them, neither was it the  intention to do so, if it could be avoided. In the meantime Bowman got  into some trouble with the Indians by deceiving them in some of their  promised trades, and he was ambushed and killed by some of them. Owing  to his manner and threats, it was rumored the Mormons had killed him. I  was actively engaged as interpreter and was continually around during  this time. I never had the least suspicion or proof that Bowman was  killed by any Mormon agency, and I believe I would have heard something  of it, if such had been the case. I know in those days it was no  uncommon thing for a man to be killed whether a Mormon or not by the  Indians, either for revenge or plunder. The Mexicans soon left in peace.    In the summer of 1853, about harvest time, the war broke out. The  immediate cause of the Indian war was the striking of an Indian with  a gun by a white man at Springville. This Indian was whipping his  squaw, when the party interfered to stop him. The Indian drew his gun  to shoot, it was wrenched from him. The man using the gun as a club,  broke both stock and Indian's head. I believe the Indian died from the  effects of the blow; he was one of Walker's band, and the latter at  once painted for war.    The same day A. J. Stewart and I were returning from Payson. When about  a mile from there some twenty-five warriors painted black, came from a  ravine, approaching us in flank with guns and bows ready. Mr. Stewart  remarked, \"We are in for it; that means war.\" We had no time to turn  and run as they were within one hundred yards of us. I knew I had never  wronged them, but had always been a friend, and I believed if we went  straight along they would not hurt us. Brother Stewart agreed with me.  We never halted or gave the road, but drove along as though nothing was  in the way.    As we went they parted and allowed us the road, never speaking or  making any sign of recognition. This same party went on up to the  Payson mill and in less than an hour commenced killing our people.    This was the commencement of what"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4657"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 1 (#8)"],[1,"precisely  one hour too late.    Thus were we lapsing into the real good old East-Indian style of doing  business. Thus Anglo-Indicus orders his first clerk to execute some  commission; the senior, having \"work\" upon his hands, sends a junior;  the junior finds the sun hot, and passes on the word to a \"peon;\" the  \"peon\" charges a porter with the errand; and the porter quietly sits or  doses in his place, trusting that Fate will bring him out of the  scrape, but firmly resolved, though the shattered globe fall, not to  stir an inch.    The reader, I must again express a hope, will pardon the length of  these descriptions,-my object is to show him how business is carried on  in these hot countries. Business generally. For had I been, not  Abdullah the Darwaysh, but a rich native merchant, it would have been    [p.28]the same. How many complaints of similar treatment have I heard  in different parts of the Eastern world! and how little can one realise  them without having actually experienced the evil! For the future I  shall never see a \"nigger\" squatting away half a dozen mortal hours in  a broiling sun patiently waiting for something or for some one, without  a lively remembrance of my own cooling of the calces at the  custom-house of Alexandria.    At length, about the end of May (1853) all was ready. Not without a  feeling of regret I left my little room among the white myrtle blossoms  and the rosy oleander flowers with the almond smell. I kissed with  humble ostentation my good host's hand in presence of his servants-he  had become somewhat unpleasantly anxious, of late, to induce in me the  true Oriental feeling, by a slight administration of the bastinado-I  bade adieu to my patients, who now amounted to about fifty, shaking  hands with all meekly and with religious equality of attention; and,  mounted in a \"trap\" which looked like a cross between a wheel-barrow  and a dog-cart, drawn by a kicking, jibbing, and biting mule, I set out  for the steamer, the \"Little Asthmatic.\"    [FN#1] The long pipe which at home takes the place of the shorter  chibuk used on the road.  [FN#2] The jubbah is a long outer garment, generally of cloth, worn by  learned and respectable men. The za'abut is a large bag-sleeved black  or brown coloured robe made of home-spun woollen, the garb of the  peasant, the hedge-priest, and the darwaysh.  [FN#3] The mountain which encircles the globe, according to the sacred  geography of the Moslems. To \"go to Kaf\" is equivalent to our \"go to  Jericho,\" or-somewhere else.  [FN#4] Sir G. Wilkinson, referring his readers to Strabo, remarks that  the \"troublesome system of passports seems to have been adopted by the  Egyptians at a very early period.\" Its present rigours, which have  lasted since the European troubles in 1848 and 1849, have a two-fold  object; in the first place, to act as a clog upon the dangerous  emigrants which Germany, Italy, and Greece have sent out into the  world; and secondly, to confine the subjects of the present Pasha of  Egypt to their fatherland and the habit of paying taxes. The  enlightened ruler (this was written during the rule of Abbas Pasha)  knows his own interests, and never willingly parts with a subject  liable to cess, at times objecting even to their obeying pilgrimage  law. We, on the other hand, in India, allow a freedom of emigration, in  my humble opinion, highly injurious to us. For not only does this  exodus thin the population, and tend to impoverish the land, it also  serves to bring our rule into disrepute in foreign lands. At another  time I shall discuss this subject more fully.  [FN#5] The glare of Alexandria has become a matter of fable in the  East. The stucco employed in overlaying its walls, erected by  Zul-karnayn, was so exquisitely tempered and so beautifully polished,  that the inhabitants, in order to protect themselves from blindness,  were constrained to wear masks.  [FN#6] The word literally means \"a bowman, an archer,\" reminding us of  \"les archers de la Sainte Hermandade,\" in the most delicious of modern  fictions. Some mis-spell the word \"Kawas,\" \"Cavass,\" and so forth!  [FN#7] A whip, a cravache of dried and twisted hippopotamus hide, the  ferule, horsewhip, and \"cat o' nine tails\" of Egypt.  [FN#8] For \"man anta?\" who art thou?  [FN#9] An opprobrious name given by the Turks to their Christian  converts. The word is derived from burmak, \"to twist, to turn.\"  [FN#10] During my journey, and since my return, some Indian papers  conducted by jocose editors made merry upon an Englishman \"turning  Turk.\" Once for all, I beg leave to point above for the facts of the  case; it must serve as a general answer to any pleasant little fictions  which may hereafter appear.  [FN#11] A stick of soft wood chewed at one end. It is generally used  throughout the East, where brushes should be avoided, as the natives  always suspect hogs' bristles.  [FN#12] Almost all Easterns sleep under a sheet, which becomes a kind  of respirator, defending them from the dews and mosquitoes by night and  the flies by day. The \"rough and ready\" traveller will learn to follow  the example, remembering that \"Nature is founder of Customs in savage  countries;\" whereas, amongst the soi-disant civilised, Nature has no  deadlier enemy than Custom.  [FN#13] It is strictly forbidden to carry arms in Egypt. This, however,  does not prevent their being as necessary-especially in places like  Alexandria, where Greek and Italian ruffians abound-as they ever were  in Rome or Leghorn during the glorious times of Italian \"liberty.\"  [FN#14] In the Azhar Mosque, immediately after Friday service, a fellow  once put his hand into my pocket, which fact alone is ample evidence of  \"progress.\"  [FN#15] As a general rule, always produce, when travelling, the  minutest bit of coin. At present, however, small change is dear in  Egypt; the Sarrafs, or money-changers, create the dearth in order to  claim a high agio. The traveller must prepare himself for a most  unpleasant task in learning the different varieties of currency, which  appear all but endless, the result of deficiency in the national  circulating medium. There are, however, few copper coins, the pieces of  ten or five faddah (or parahs), whereas silver and gold abound. As  regards the latter metal, strangers should mistrust all small pieces,  Turkish as well as Egyptian. \"The greater part are either cut or  cracked, or perhaps both, and worn down to mere spangles: after taking  them, it will not be possible to pass them without considerable loss.\"  Above all things, the traveller must be careful never to change gold  except in large towns, where such a display of wealth would not arouse  suspicion or cupidity; and on no occasion when travelling even to  pronounce the ill-omened word \"Kis\" (purse). Many have lost their lives  by neglecting these simple precautions.  [FN#16] Some prefer a long chain of pure gold divided into links and  covered with leather, so as to resemble the twisted girdle which the  Arab fastens round his waist. It is a precaution well known to the  wandering knights of old. Others, again, in very critical situations,  open with a lancet the shoulder, or any other fleshy part of the body,  and insert a precious stone, which does not show in its novel purse.  [FN#17] Any \"Companion to the Medicine Chest\" will give, to those that  require such information, the names of drugs and instruments necessary  for a journey; but it must be borne in mind that hot countries require  double quantities of tonics, and half the allowance of cathartics  necessary in cold climates. Sonnini, however, is right when he says of  the Egyptian fellahs, that their stomachs, accustomed to digest bread  badly baked, acrid and raw vegetables, and other green and unwholesome  nourishment, require doses fit only for horses. Advisable precautions  are, in the first place, to avoid, if travelling as a native, any signs  of European manufacture in knives, scissors, weights, scales and other  such articles. Secondly, glass bottles are useless: the drugs should be  stowed away in tin or wooden boxes, such as the natives of the country  use, and when a phial is required, it must be fitted into an etui of  some kind. By this means, ground glass stoppers and plentiful cotton  stuffing, the most volatile essences may be carried about without great  waste. After six months of the driest heat, in Egypt and Arabia, not  more than about one-fourth of my Prussic acid and chloroform had  evaporated. And, thirdly, if you travel in the East, a few bottles of  tincture of cantharides-highly useful as a rubefacient, excitant, et  cetera-must never be omitted. I made the mistake of buying my drugs in  England, and had the useless trouble of looking after them during the  journey. Both at Alexandria and Cairo they are to be found in  abundance, cheaper than in London, and good enough for all practical  purposes.    [p.29]CHAPTER III.    THE NILE STEAMBOAT-THE \"LITTLE ASTHMATIC.\"        IN the days of the Pitts we have invariably a \"Relation\" of Egyptian  travellers who embark for a place called \"Roseet\" on the \"River Nilus.\"  Wanderers of the Brucean age were wont to record their impressions of  voyage upon land subjects observed between Alexandria and Cairo. A  little later we find every one inditing rhapsodies about, and  descriptions of, his or her Dahabiyah (barge) on the canal. After this  came the steamer. And after the steamer will come the railroad, which  may disappoint the author tourist, but will be delightful to that  sensible class of men who wish to get over the greatest extent of  ground with the least inconvenience to themselves and others. Then  shall the Mahmudiyah-ugliest and most wearisome of canals-be given up  to cotton boats and grain barges, and then will note-books and the  headings of chapters clean ignore its existence.    I saw the canal at its worst, when the water was low; and I have not  one syllable to say in"]]]
