In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom,  which first requires an explanation--a sign, moreover, which has too  many interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning in itself  alone: that morality, in the sense in which it has been understood  hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a prejudice, perhaps a  prematureness or preliminariness, probably something of the same rank  as astrology and alchemy, but in any case something which must be  surmounted. The surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even the  self-mounting of morality--let that be the name for the long-secret  labour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright,  and also the most wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones  of the soul.    33. It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice for  one's neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, must be mercilessly  called to account, and brought to judgment; just as the aesthetics  of \"disinterested contemplation,\" under which the emasculation of art  nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience.  There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments \"for others\"  and \"NOT for myself,\" for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here,  and for one asking promptly: \"Are they not perhaps--DECEPTIONS?\"--That  they PLEASE--him who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and also  the mere spectator--that is still no argument in their FAVOUR, but just  calls for caution. Let us therefore be cautious!    34. At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays,  seen from every position, the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we  think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light  upon: we find proof after proof thereof, which would fain allure us into  surmises concerning a deceptive principle in the \"nature of things.\"  He, however, who makes thinking itself, and consequently \"the spirit,\"  responsible for the falseness of the world--an honourable exit, which  every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of--he  who regards this world, including space, time, form, and movement, as  falsely DEDUCED, would have at least good reason in the end to become  distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing upon  us the worst of scurvy tricks? and what guarantee would it give that  it would not continue to do what it has always been doing? In all  seriousness, the innocence of thinkers has something touching and  respect-inspiring in it, which even nowadays permits them to wait upon  consciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answers:  for example, whether it be \"real\" or not, and why it keeps the outer  world so resolutely at a distance, and other questions of the same  description. The belief in \"immediate certainties\" is a MORAL NAIVETE  which does honour to us philosophers; but--we have now to cease being  \"MERELY moral\" men! Apart from morality, such belief is a folly which  does little honour to us! If in middle-class life an ever-ready distrust  is regarded as the sign of a \"bad character,\" and consequently as an  imprudence, here among us, beyond the middle-class world and its Yeas  and Nays, what should prevent our being imprudent and saying: the  philosopher has at length a RIGHT to \"bad character,\" as the being who  has hitherto been most befooled on earth--he is now under OBLIGATION  to distrustfulness, to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of  suspicion.--Forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of  expression; for I myself have long ago learned to think and estimate  differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I keep at  least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which  philosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT? It is nothing  more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it  is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the world. So much must be  conceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basis  of perspective estimates and semblances; and if, with the virtuous  enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers, one wished to do away  altogether with the \"seeming world\"--well, granted that YOU could do  that,--at least nothing of your \"truth\" would thereby remain! Indeed,  what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an  essential opposition of \"true\" and \"false\"? Is it not enough to suppose  degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker shades and  tones of semblance--different valeurs, as the painters say? Why might  not the world WHICH CONCERNS US--be a fiction? And to any one who  suggested: \"But to a fiction belongs an originator?\"--might it not be  bluntly replied: WHY? May not this \"belong\" also belong to the fiction?  Is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the  subject, just as towards the predicate and object? Might not the  philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar? All respect  to governesses, but is it not time that philosophy should renounce  governess-faith?    35. O Voltaire! O humanity! O idiocy! There is something ticklish in  \"the truth,\" and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes about it  too humanely--\"il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien\"--I wager he  finds nothing!    36. Supposing that nothing else is \"given\" as real but our world of  desires and passions, that we cannot sink or rise to any other \"reality\"  but just that of our impulses--for thinking is only a relation of these  impulses to one another:--are we not permitted to make the attempt and  to ask the question whether this which is \"given\" does not SUFFICE, by  means of our counterparts, for the understanding even of the so-called  mechanical (or \"material\") world? I do not mean as an illusion, a  \"semblance,\" a \"representation\" (in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian  sense), but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions  themselves--as a more primitive form of the world of emotions, in  which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity, which afterwards  branches off and develops itself in organic processes (naturally also,  refines and debilitates)--as a kind of instinctive life in which all  organic functions, including self-regulation, assimilation, nutrition,  secretion, and change of matter, are still synthetically united with  one another--as a PRIMARY FORM of life?--In the end, it is not only  permitted to make this attempt, it is commanded by the conscience of  LOGICAL METHOD. Not to assume several kinds of causality, so long as  the attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its  furthest extent (to absurdity, if I may be allowed to say so): that is  a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays--it follows  \"from its definition,\" as mathematicians say. The question is ultimately  whether we really recognize the will as OPERATING, whether we believe in  the causality of the will; if we do so--and fundamentally our belief IN  THIS is just our belief in causality itself--we MUST make the attempt  to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality.  \"Will\" can naturally only operate on \"will\"--and not on \"matter\" (not  on \"nerves,\" for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be  hazarded, whether will does not operate on will wherever \"effects\"  are recognized--and whether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power  operates therein, is not just the power of will, the effect of will.  Granted, finally, that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive  life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of  will--namely, the Will to Power, as my thesis puts it; granted that all  organic functions could be traced back to this Will to Power, and that  the solution of the problem of generation and nutrition--it is one  problem--could also be found therein: one would thus have acquired the  right to define ALL active force unequivocally as WILL TO POWER. The  world seen from within, the world defined and designated according to  its \"intelligible character\"--it would simply be \"Will to Power,\" and  nothing else.    37. \"What? Does not that mean in popular language: God is disproved, but  not the devil?\"--On the contrary! On the contrary, my friends! And who  the devil also compels you to speak popularly!    38. As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times with  the French Revolution (that terrible farce, quite superfluous when  judged close at hand, into which, however, the noble and visionary  spectators of all Europe have interpreted from a distance their own  indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately, UNTIL THE TEXT HAS  DISAPPEARED UNDER THE INTERPRETATION), so a noble posterity might once  more misunderstand the whole of the past, and perhaps only thereby make  ITS aspect endurable.--Or rather, has not this already happened? Have  not we ourselves been--that \"noble posterity\"? And, in so far as we now  comprehend this, is it not--thereby already past? "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete (#8)"],[1,"the sailors  charged with mutiny were in irons.  I rather felt for a time a wish that  I had not gone aboard just then.  As the men charged with mutiny  submitted to being placed in irons without resistance, I always doubted  if they knew that they had mutinied until they were told.    By the time I was ready to leave the ship again I thought I had learned  enough of the working of the double and single pulley, by which  passengers were let down from the upper deck of the ship to the steamer  below, and determined to let myself down without assistance.  Without  saying anything of my intentions to any one, I mounted the railing, and  taking hold of the centre rope, just below the upper block, I put one  foot on the hook below the lower block, and stepped off just as I did so  some one called out \"hold on.\"  It was too late.  I tried to \"hold on\"  with all my might, but my heels went up, and my head went down so  rapidly that my hold broke, and I plunged head foremost into the water,  some twenty-five feet below, with such velocity that it seemed to me I  never would stop.  When I came to the surface again, being a fair  swimmer, and not having lost my presence of mind, I swam around until a  bucket was let down for me, and I was drawn up without a scratch or  injury. I do not believe there was a man on board who sympathized with  me in the least when they found me uninjured.  I rather enjoyed the joke  myself. The captain of the Suviah died of his disease a few months later,  and I believe before the mutineers were tried.  I hope they got clear,  because, as before stated, I always thought the mutiny was all in the  brain of a very weak and sick man.    After reaching shore, or Shell Island, the labor of getting to Corpus  Christi was slow and tedious.  There was, if my memory serves me, but  one small steamer to transport troops and baggage when the 4th infantry  arrived.  Others were procured later.  The distance from Shell Island to  Corpus Christi was some sixteen or eighteen miles.  The channel to the  bay was so shallow that the steamer, small as it was, had to be dragged  over the bottom when loaded.  Not more than one trip a day could be  effected.  Later this was remedied, by deepening the channel and  increasing the number of vessels suitable to its navigation.    Corpus Christi is near the head of the bay of the same name, formed by  the entrance of the Nueces River into tide-water, and is on the west  bank of that bay.  At the time of its first occupancy by United States  troops there was a small Mexican hamlet there, containing probably less  than one hundred souls. There was, in addition, a small American trading  post, at which goods were sold to Mexican smugglers.  All goods were put  up in compact packages of about one hundred pounds each, suitable for  loading on pack mules.  Two of these packages made a load for an  ordinary Mexican mule, and three for the larger ones.  The bulk of the  trade was in leaf tobacco, and domestic cotton-cloths and calicoes.  The  Mexicans had, before the arrival of the army, but little to offer in  exchange except silver.  The trade in tobacco was enormous, considering  the population to be supplied.  Almost every Mexican above the age of  ten years, and many much younger, smoked the cigarette.  Nearly every  Mexican carried a pouch of leaf tobacco, powdered by rolling in the  hands, and a roll of corn husks to make wrappers.  The cigarettes were  made by the smokers as they used them.    Up to the time of which I write, and for years afterwards--I think until  the administration of President Juarez--the cultivation, manufacture and  sale of tobacco constituted a government monopoly, and paid the bulk of  the revenue collected from internal sources.  The price was enormously  high, and made successful smuggling very profitable.  The difficulty of  obtaining tobacco is probably the reason why everybody, male and female,  used it at that time.  I know from my own experience that when I was at  West Point, the fact that tobacco, in every form, was prohibited, and  the mere possession of the weed severely punished, made the majority of  the cadets, myself included, try to acquire the habit of using it.  I  failed utterly at the time and for many years afterward; but the  majority accomplished the object of their youthful ambition.    Under Spanish rule Mexico was prohibited from producing anything that  the mother-country could supply.  This rule excluded the cultivation of  the grape, olive and many other articles to which the soil and climate  were well adapted.  The country was governed for \"revenue only;\" and  tobacco, which cannot be raised in Spain, but is indigenous to Mexico,  offered a fine instrumentality for securing this prime object of  government.  The native population had been in the habit of using \"the  weed\" from a period, back of any recorded history of this continent.  Bad habits--if not restrained by law or public opinion--spread more  rapidly and universally than good ones, and the Spanish colonists  adopted the use of tobacco almost as generally as the natives.  Spain,  therefore, in order to secure the largest revenue from this source,  prohibited the cultivation, except in specified localities--and in these  places farmed out the privilege at a very high price.  The tobacco when  raised could only be sold to the government, and the price to the  consumer was limited only by the avarice of the authorities, and the  capacity of the people to pay.    All laws for the government of the country were enacted in Spain, and  the officers for their execution were appointed by the Crown, and sent  out to the New El Dorado.  The Mexicans had been brought up ignorant of  how to legislate or how to rule. When they gained their independence,  after many years of war, it was the most natural thing in the world that  they should adopt as their own the laws then in existence.  The only  change was, that Mexico became her own executor of the laws and the  recipient of the revenues.  The tobacco tax, yielding so large a revenue  under the law as it stood, was one of the last, if not the very last, of  the obnoxious imposts to be repealed.  Now, the citizens are allowed to  cultivate any crops the soil will yield.  Tobacco is cheap, and every  quality can be produced. Its use is by no means so general as when I  first visited the country.    Gradually the \"Army of Occupation\" assembled at Corpus Christi.  When it  was all together it consisted of seven companies of the 2d regiment of  dragoons, four companies of light artillery, five regiments of infantry  --the 3d, 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th--and one regiment of artillery acting as  infantry--not more than three thousand men in all.  General Zachary  Taylor commanded the whole.  There were troops enough in one body to  establish a drill and discipline sufficient to fit men and officers for  all they were capable of in case of battle.  The rank and file were  composed of men who had enlisted in time of peace, to serve for seven  dollars a month, and were necessarily inferior as material to the  average volunteers enlisted later in the war expressly to fight, and  also to the volunteers in the war for the preservation of the Union.  The men engaged in the Mexican war were brave, and the officers of the  regular army, from highest to lowest, were educated in their profession.  A more efficient army for its number and armament, I do not believe ever  fought a battle than the one commanded by General Taylor in his first  two engagements on Mexican--or Texan soil.    The presence of United States troops on the edge of the disputed  territory furthest from the Mexican settlements, was not sufficient to  provoke hostilities.  We were sent to provoke a fight, but it was  essential that Mexico should commence it.  It was very doubtful whether  Congress would declare war; but if Mexico should attack our troops, the  Executive could announce, \"Whereas, war exists by the acts of, etc.,\"  and prosecute the contest with vigor.  Once initiated there were but few  public men who would have the courage to oppose it.  Experience proves  that the man who obstructs a war in which his nation is engaged, no  matter whether right or wrong, occupies no enviable place in life or  history.  Better for him, individually, to advocate \"war, pestilence,  and famine,\" than to act as obstructionist to a war already begun.  The  history of the defeated rebel will be honorable hereafter, compared with  that of the Northern man who aided him by conspiring against his  government while protected by it.  The most favorable posthumous history  the stay-at-home traitor can hope for is--oblivion.    Mexico showing no willingness to come to the Nueces to drive the  invaders from her soil, it became necessary for the \"invaders\" to  approach to within a convenient distance to be struck. Accordingly,  preparations were begun for moving the army to the Rio Grande, to a  point near Matamoras.  It was desirable to occupy a position near the  largest centre of population possible to reach, without absolutely  invading territory to which we set up no claim whatever.    The distance from Corpus Christi to Matamoras is about one hundred and  fifty miles.  The country does not abound in fresh water, and the length  of the marches had to be regulated by the distance between water  supplies.  Besides the streams, there were occasional pools, filled  during the rainy season, some probably made by the traders, who  travelled constantly between Corpus Christi and the Rio Grande, and some  by the buffalo. There was not at that time a single habitation,  cultivated field, or herd of domestic animals, between Corpus Christi  and Matamoras.  It was necessary, therefore, to have a wagon train  sufficiently large to transport the camp and garrison equipage,  officers' baggage, rations for the army, and part rations of grain for  the artillery horses and all the animals"]]]
