I  seldom, at the proper season, visit a clump of this growing in a sunny  opening, without finding, besides a store of other insects, one or both of  these grand butterflies enthroned on the ample purplish flower-heads, and  _fanning_ their gorgeous wings, after the custom of their genus, then  launching into the air, and, after a few circling evolutions in that  element, returning to the self-same flower-heads, their chosen seats.    Both of these flies are easily captured when in this position, as they  allow a near approach, and can be without hindrance swept off by a rapid  side-stroke of the net.    The glorious Purple Emperor is celebrated for his predilection for a throne  on the oak, though some other lofty trees, such as the ash, are  occasionally honoured by the imperial presence; but his habits and _locale_  will be referred to more particularly hereafter.    That lovely butterfly, the Silver-washed Fritillary, has a _penchant_ for  settling on the bramble, which {48} justifies the preference by proving  itself the insect's best friend; but withal a most provoking opponent to  his would-be captor, who may get him safely within the net's mouth at the  first stroke, when, ten to one, the trusty bramble-hooks clutch into the  gauze, and effectually prevent the quick turn of the net that should close  it, while the prisoner, seeing his chance, darts out with a sharp rustle  that one's irritated feelings easily interpret into a derisive laugh.    But experience will in time teach the fly-catcher the required adroitness  to avoid this humiliating defeat.           *       *       *       *       *      {49}    CHAPTER V.

Having complied with the old adage, \"First catch your hare,\" the next point  naturally is--how to cook it. So, having caught our butterfly, what are we  to do with him?--a question that generally resolves itself firstly into    HOW TO KILL A BUTTERFLY.    This truculent sentence may, I fear, look like a blot on the page to some  tender-hearted reader, and, in truth, this killing business is the one  shadow on the otherwise sunshiny picture, which we would all gladly leave  out, were it possible to preserve a butterfly's beauty alive; but this  cannot be done, and yet we have made up our minds to possess that  beauty--to collect butterflies, in short; there is but one way for it, and  so a butterfly's pleasure must be shortened for a few {50} days, to add to  our pleasure and instruction, perhaps for years after.    In the time of the great Ray, in such mean repute was the science of  entomology held, mainly, I believe, on account of the _small size_ of its  objects, that an action at law was brought to set aside the will of an  estimable woman, Lady Glanville, on the ground of _insanity_, the only  symptom of which that they could bring forward in evidence was her  _fondness for collecting insects_!    But this was some two centuries ago, and matters have greatly mended for  the entomologist since then. Now he may collect butterflies, or other  flies, as he pleases, without bringing down a commission \"_de lunatico_\" on  his _head_, but still the goodness of his _heart_ is sometimes called in  question, and he has to encounter the equally obnoxious charge of _cruelty_  to the objects of his admiration--that, too, from intelligent and worthy  friends, whose good opinion he would most unwillingly forfeit.    He, therefore, is naturally most anxious that those friends should be led  to share his own conviction, that the pursuit of entomology--the needful  butterfly killing and all included--may be not only not cruel, but actually  beneficent in theory and practice.    So I will briefly try to act as apologist for the \"brotherhood of the net,\"  myself included.    In the first place, I will state roundly my sincere belief that _insects  cannot feel pain_. This is no special pleading, or \"making the wish the  father to the thought,\" {51} but a conviction founded on an ample mass of  evidence, on my own observations and experiments, and strengthened by  analogical reasoning. I wish I had space to lay this evidence in full  before the reader; but this being here impracticable, I will not damage the  argument by taking a few links out of a chain of facts which depend on  their close connexion with each other for their strength and value.    There is, however, one fact which may be taken by itself, and goes a long  way in our favour, that I must mention here.    Insects, when mutilated in a way that would cause excessive pain and speedy  death to vertebrate animals, afterwards perform all the functions of  life--eating, drinking, &c. with the same evident _gusto_ and power of  enjoyment as before. Plenty of striking instances of this are on record,  and, as an example, I have seen a wasp that had been snipped in two,  afterwards regale himself with avidity upon some red syrup, which, as he  imbibed, gathered into a large ruby bead just behind the wings (where the  stomach should have been); but really the creature's pleasure seemed to be  only augmented by the change in his anatomy, because he could drink ten  times his ordinary fill of sweets, without, of course, getting any the  fuller. I could almost fancy a scientific epicure envying the insect his  ever fresh appetite and gastronomic capabilities.    After all that can be said on this subject, there will still probably be  misgivings in the mind of many, both {52} as to the question of insect  feelings and also as to our right to shorten their existence, even by a  painless death.    As to the first point, we have now the means of giving any insect an  utterly painless quietus, be it capable of feeling pain or no.    In regard to the second, I think few will deny that man enjoys a vested  right to make use of any of the inferior animals, even to the taking of  their life, if the so doing ministers to his own well-being or pleasure,  and practically every one assumes this right in one way or another. Game  animals are shot down (and they assuredly _do_ feel pain), not as  necessaries of life, but confessedly as luxuries. Fish are hooked, crabs,  lobsters, shrimps perish by thousands, victims to our fancies.  Unscrupulously we destroy every insect whose presence displeases us,  harmless as they may be to our own persons. The _aphides_ on our flowers,  the moths in our furs, the \"beetles\" in our kitchens--all die by thousands  at our pleasure. Then, if all this be right, are we not also justified in  appropriating a little butterfly life to ourselves, and does not the mental  feast that their after-death beauty affords us at least furnish an equal  excuse for their sacrifice with any that can be urged in favour of any  animal slaughter, just to tickle the palate or minister to our grosser  appetites? To this query there can be, I think, but one fair answer, so we  may return with a better face to the question, \"How to kill a butterfly.\"    [Illustration: VIII.]    {53}    I have alluded above to a painless mode of doing so, doubtless applicable  to all insects. I know it answers admirably with the large moths, so  tenacious of life under other circumstances. This potent agent is  _chloroform_, whose pain-quelling properties are so well known as regards  the human constitution.    There is a little apparatus[8] constructed for carrying this fluid safely  to the field, and letting out a drop at a time into the box with the  captured insect, taking care that the drop does not go on to the insect. Or  a wide-mouthed bottle may be used, having at the bottom a pad of  blotting-paper, or some absorbent substance, on which a few drops of  chloroform may now and then be dropped. The insect being slipped into this,  and the stopper or hand being placed over the bottle's mouth, insensibility  (in the insect) follows immediately, and in a few minutes, at most, it is  completely lifeless.    But the usual and quickest mode of despatch is by _a quick nip between the  finger and thumb applied just under the wings_, causing, for the most part,  _instantaneous death_: and this can be done through the net, when the {54}  inclosed butterfly shuts his wings, as he usually does when the net wraps  round him.    Now take one of your thin pins, and pass it through the thorax of the  butterfly, while open or shut, and put it into the corked lining of your  pocket-box. So secured, the butterfly will travel uninjured till you reach  home; but a heap of dead butterflies in a box together will, in the course  of a long walk, so jostle together, as to entirely destroy each other's  beauty, rubbing off all their painted scales, when, of course, they are as  butterflies no longer.    When you get home, take out all the pins, excepting such as may be stuck  _perpendicularly_ through the _middle of the thorax_, and as soon as  possible proceed to \"set\" your captures.    [Illustration]    Preparatory to this, some articles called _setting-boards_ must be  provided. A section of one of these is shown in the accompanying cut; but  in reality they are made much longer, so as to accommodate a column of  half-a-dozen butterflies or more: the breadth may vary, {55} according to  the width of the butterflies that are to be set thereon.    The bottom is usually a thin slip of deal, on which are glued two strips of  cork, bevelled off towards the edges, with a slightly curved face.  Sometimes, however, the whole board is made of soft pine,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33874"],[0,"Wild Bees, Wasps and Ants and Other Stinging Insects (#8)"],[1,"till the end of June, at which time  he had 35 cocoons still unopened; in 1851 some more emerged, and he opened  one or two of the closed ones and found that they still contained living  larvae; he closed them up again, and in April, 1852, examined them and  found the larvae still alive; at the end of May they changed to pupae and  appeared as perfect insects, the result being that some of the specimens  were at least three years before reaching maturity. {59}    There is a nest of yet another style adopted by one of our species (_Osmia  xanthomelana_). This is formed of a series of pitcher-shaped cells made of  mud, constructed at the roots of grass. The species which makes it is rare  and seems to have its headquarters on the coasts of Wales, although it has  occurred in the Isle of Wight and elsewhere. This species also is not  constant in its habits, as it has been known to make its cells underground.  A very curious habit was noticed some years ago by Mr. Vincent R. Perkins  in another species of this genus (_Osmia bicolor_; pl. D, 28); the species  nests in the ground or in snail shells, but, in the case under his  observation, Mr. Perkins found that the little bees covered up all the  snail shells in which they had built their cells with short pieces of  \"bents\" so as to make a little hillock over each about two or three inches  in height, somewhat resembling a miniature nest of _Formica rufa_, the  large horse ant, each mound containing hundreds of pieces. This is the only  record I know of this habit, which must entail a large amount of labour for  the bee.    These varying habits in the same species {60} show pretty clearly that  these little creatures are not driven by any blind instinct in the adoption  of their methods of nest building: they appear to have a distinct power of  choice and adaptation according to their environment, unless of course it  can be shown that the offspring of, say, a snail shell inhabitant follows  its parents' habits, and that that of a ground borer does the same--but  even that would not explain the case given by F. Smith, and quoted above,  where an _Osmia_ had filled up the whorls of a shell and then, finding the  final whorl too large, placed two cells horizontally to fill it: that seems  to indicate distinct design on the part of the bee and would be hard to  explain as due to instinct. Unfortunately, with the exception of a very  few, the species of _Osmia_ are rare in this country, so that few  opportunities are available for studying their habits, which are certainly  amongst the most interesting of any genus.    [Illustration: PLATE D.    24. _Anthophora pilipes, male._ 25. _Anthophora pilipes, female._ 26.  _Melecta armata, female._ 27. _Anthidium manicatum, female._ 28. _Osmia  bicolor, female._ 29. _Bombus terrestris, female._ 30. _Bombus lapidarius.  female._ 31. _Psithyrus rupestris, female._    [_face p. 61._ ]    {61}    A COLONY OF ANTHOPHORA    _Anthophora pilipes_ (pl. D, 24, 25), one of our early spring bees, often  forms enormous colonies. I have sometimes seen sandpits in which the sides  were riddled all over with holes of this species, and where the insects  were in such numbers that a distinct hum was audible from the vibration of  their wings. In such colonies one is sure to detect some of their cuckoo  associates, _Melecta armata_ (pl. D, 26). They are deep black bees, much of  the same size as their hosts but with more pointed tails and with a small  spot of snow-white hairs on the side of each segment of the body; like  other cuckoos they sail about in a more demure way than their hosts, but a  more lively scene than a large colony of _Anthophora_ can hardly be found.  The _Anthophora_ provisions its cells with honey and pollen, and its egg in  consequence floats on the top--the {62} number of cells varies from five or  six up to ten or eleven.    _Anthophora pilipes_ has a very close relative in _Anthophora retusa_,  which also forms large colonies, but it is as a rule less common. These two  species are exceedingly alike, in fact it requires some skill on the part  of the observer to differentiate their females. They are both black and  clothed with black hairs, and both have yellow pollen-brushes, but in  _retusa_ the hairs are shorter and not quite of such a deep black as those  of _pilipes_, and the spurs of the tibiae are pale, whereas in _pilipes_  they are black. The males, however, differ widely, although much alike in  colour; in _pilipes_ the feet of the middle pair of legs are clothed with  enormously long hairs, the basal joint has a dense fringe of black hairs in  front and some long black hairs behind (see pl. D, fig. 24); in _retusa_  the basal joint of the middle pair of feet have a fan-shaped fringe of  black hairs, and the rest of the joints are clothed with longer hairs, but  not long enough to be specially noticeable. _A. retusa_ is visited by the  same cuckoo as _A. pilipes_ and also by its rare ally _Melecta luctuosa_,  which only differs from _armata_ {63} (pl. D, 26) in the larger and squarer  spots of the body and various small structural characters hardly  appreciable except by specialists. The Anthophoras have other parasites  besides their cuckoos; one is a beetle, which, however, is rare, and which  lays its egg in the _Anthophora_ cells; the other is a very minute member  of the Hymenopterous family, whose larva when hatched feeds upon the larva  of the bee. Notwithstanding these disadvantages both species are abundant,  although _retusa_ is more local than _pilipes_. A very interesting fact  connected with this genus has just been communicated to me by the Rev.  F. D. Morice. John Ray, who lived in the seventeenth century, mentions in  his book _Historia Insectorum_ (published posthumously in 1710), p. 243,  that a large colony of a bee, which from his description was clearly an  _Anthophora_, as he specially calls attention to the great difference  between the males and females, inhabited a certain locality at Kilby near  \"Hill Morton\" in Northamptonshire. Mr. Morice, who for many years resided  at Rugby, knew Hillmorton, as it is now spelled, well, and tells me that a  large colony of _Anthophora_ was in that same locality when he knew it only  {64} a few years ago. Of course there is no proof that it has been there  throughout the intervening period, but there seems to be no reason to doubt  it, and if so it is a most interesting case of a persistent colony.           *       *       *       *       *    {65}    BEES AND POLLEN-COLLECTING    Bees whether solitary or social enter flowers for the sake of the honey in  their nectaries and the pollen on their anthers. In some cases the flowers  automatically deposit pollen on the bees during the operation, which  enables them to fertilize other flowers of the same species, but the pollen  which the bee requires for its own use has to be worked for and collected  on organs specially adapted for the purpose. These vary very much in the  different families and genera; they exist only in the females, and, if the  males get covered with pollen, as they often do, it is probably more by  chance than purpose, and it is doubtful if it is of any value to the brood,  although no doubt useful in fertilizing other flowers. All our bees, as has  been pointed out before, are clothed more or less with branched or  feather-like hairs, which would appear to be admirably adapted for the  collecting of pollen. {66} At the same time some species which have their  bodies clothed with branched hairs have simple or spirally grooved hairs on  the collecting organ--others collect on very much branched hairs--so that  there seems to be no exact relationship between the plumosity of the hairs  and their utility in collecting. The collecting brushes are either on the  hind legs or, as in some cases, on the ventral surface of the body. In a  female _Andrena_, the hind leg has a tuft of curled hairs near the base of  the leg, and a more or less heavy brush on the outside of the tibia or shin  (fig. 8). When a female returns after a collecting expedition these  specially hairy regions are a mass of pollen grains, and the \"beautiful  yellow legs\", so often remarked upon in some bees, are not always due to  the colour of the hairs but to that of the grains of pollen adhering to  them. The genera which collect on the under surface of the body have to  visit flowers where the anthers lie in such a position that they can  transfer the pollen on to it; the pea flower tribe are favourites with  them, and also the _Compositae_. All this section have long tongues so that  they are able to reach the nectaries of {67} [Illustration: FIG. 8.]  [Illustration: FIG. 9.] plants with long tubular flowers. In visiting these  the pollen is often deposited on the back of the bee; this it is able to  transfer to its under side by means of the brushes on its feet or tarsi.  The arrangements of the humble bees for pollen gathering are altogether  different from those mentioned above. They have the hind shin outwardly  shining and rather concave, with a series of long curved hairs running down  each side of it and partly curving over it, so that they carry their mass  of pollen in a sort of basket, scientifically called the \"corbicula\" (fig.  9); this would be impossible if the pollen were gathered dry, as it is by  most of the solitary bees, so the bee moistens it on the flower with the  nectar she has been sucking so as to make it sticky, and then transfers it  into her basket by means of her foot brushes. The pollen therefore on the  hind leg of a humble bee is all in one mass and can be {68} removed as  such. When the bee reaches her nest this must of course save her the  trouble which the solitary bee must have of cleaning off all the separate  grains of pollen which are mixed up among the hairs.    A word or two may be convenient here on the combs and cleaning apparatus of  bees. Any one who has"]]]
