E'en those apart who were the sound denied,  Fell down instinctive, and in spirit died.  Nor stay'd he yet--his eye, his frown, his speech,  His very gesture, had a power to teach:  With outstretch'd arms, strong voice, and piercing call,  He won the field, and made the Dagons fall;  And thus in triumph took his glorious way,  Through scenes of horror, terror, and dismay.\"        LETTER V.        Say then which class to greater folly stoop,  The great in promise, or the poor in hope?    Be brave, for your leader is brave, and vows reformation; there  shall be in England seven halfpenny loaves sold for a penny; and the  three-hooped pot shall have ten hoops. I will make it felony to  drink small beer:  all shall eat and drink on my score, and I will  apparel them all in one livery,that they may agree like brothers;  and they shall all worship me as their lord.                                                   SHAKSPEARE, Henry  VI.                         ------------------------    THE ELECTION.    The Evils of the Contest, and how in part to be avoided--The  Miseries endured by a Friend of the Candidate--The various Liberties  taken with him who has no Personal Interest in the Success--The  unreasonable Expectations of Voters--The Censures of the opposing  Party--The Vices as well as Follies shown in such Time of Contest--  Plans and Cunning of Electors--Evils which remain after the  Decision, opposed in vain by the Efforts of the Friendly, and of the  Successful; among whom is the Mayor--Story of his Advancement till  he was raised to the Government of the Borough--These Evils not to  be placed in Balance with the Liberty of the People, but are yet  Subjects of just Complaint.      YES, our Election's past, and we've been free,  Somewhat as madmen without keepers be;  And such desire of Freedom has been shown,  That both the parties wish'd her all their own:  All our free smiths and cobblers in the town  Were loth to lay such pleasant freedom down;  To put the bludgeon and cockade aside,  And let us pass unhurt and undefied.     True! you might then your party's sign produce,  And so escape with only half th' abuse:  With half the danger as you walk'd along,  With rage and threat'ning but from half the throng.  This you might do, and not your fortune mend,  For where you lost a foe you gain'd a friend;  And to distress you, vex you, and expose,  Election-friends are worse than any foes;  The party-curse is with the canvass past,  But party-friendship, for jour grief, will last.     Friends of all kinds; the civil and the rude,  Who humbly wish, or boldly dare t'intrude:  These beg or take a liberty to come  (Friends should be free), and make your house their home;  They know that warmly you their cause espouse,  And come to make their boastings and their bows;  You scorn their manners, you their words mistrust,  But you must hear them, and they know you must.     One plainly sees a friendship firm and true,  Between the noble candidate and you;  So humbly begs (and states at large the case),  \"You'll think of Bobby and the little place.\"     Stifling his shame by drink, a wretch will come,  And prate your wife and daughter from the room:  In pain you hear him, and at heart despise,  Yet with heroic mind your pangs disguise;  And still in patience to the sot attend,  To show what man can bear to serve a friend.     One enters hungry--not to be denied,  And takes his place and jokes--\"We're of a side.\"  Yet worse, the proser who, upon the strength  Of his one vote, has tales of three hours' length;  This sorry rogue you bear, yet with surprise  Start at his oaths, and sicken at his lies.     Then comes there one, and tells in friendly way  What the opponents in their anger say;  All that through life has vex'd you, all abuse,  Will this kind friend in pure regard produce;  And having through your own offences run,  Adds (as appendage) what your friends have done,     Has any female cousin made a trip  To Gretna Green, or more vexatious slip?  Has your wife's brother, or your uncle's son,  Done aught amiss, or is he thought t'have done?  Is there of all your kindred some who lack  Vision direct, or have a gibbous back?  From your unlucky name may quips and puns  Be made by these upbraiding Goths and Huns?  To some great public character have you  Assigned the fame to worth and talents due,  Proud of your praise?--In this, in any case,  Where the brute-spirit may affix disgrace,  These friends will smiling bring it, and the while  You silent sit, and practise for a smile.     Vain of their power, and of their value sure,  They nearly guess the tortures you endure;  Nor spare one pang--for they perceive your heart  Goes with the cause; you'd die before you'd start;  Do what they may, they're sure you'll not offend  Men who have pledged their honours to your friend.     Those friends indeed, who start as in a race,  May love the sport, and laugh at this disgrace;  They have in view the glory and the prize,  Nor heed the dirty steps by which they rise:  But we their poor associates lose the fame,  Though more than partners in the toil and shame.     Were this the whole; and did the time produce  But shame and toil, but riot and abuse;  We might be then from serious griefs exempt,  And view the whole with pity and contempt.  Alas! but here the vilest passions rule;  It is Seduction's, is Temptation's school;  Where vices mingle in the oddest ways,  The grossest slander and the dirtiest praise;  Flattery enough to make the vainest sick,  And clumsy stratagem, and scoundrel trick:  Nay more, your anger and contempt to cause,  These, while they fish for profit, claim applause;  Bribed, bought, and bound, they banish shame and fear;  Tell you they're staunch, and have a soul sincere;  Then talk of honour, and, if doubt's express'd,  Show where it lies, and smite upon the breast.     Among these worthies, some at first declare  For whom they vote:  he then has most to spare;  Others hang off--when coming to the post  Is spurring time, and then he'll spare the most:  While some demurring, wait, and find at last  The bidding languish, and the market past;  These will affect all bribery to condemn,  And be it Satan laughs, he laughs at them.     Some too are pious--One desired the Lord  To teach him where \"to drop his little word;  To lend his vote where it will profit best;  Promotion came not from the east or west;  But as their freedom had promoted some,  He should be glad to know which way 'twould come.  It was a naughty world, and where to sell  His precious charge, was more than he could tell.\"     \"But you succeeded?\"--True, at mighty cost,  And our good friend, I fear, will think he's lost:  Inns, horses, chaises, dinners, balls, and notes;  What fill'd their purses, and what drench'd their throats;  The private pension, and indulgent lease, -  Have all been granted to these friends who fleece;  Friends who will hang like burs upon his coat,  And boundless judge the value of a vote.     And though the terrors of the time be pass'd,  There still remain the scatterings of the blast;  The boughs are parted that entwined before,  And ancient harmony exists no more;  The gusts of wrath our peaceful seats deform,  And sadly flows the sighing of the storm:  Those who have gain'd are sorry for the gloom,  But they who lost, unwilling peace should come;  There open envy, here suppress'd delight,  Yet live till time shall better thoughts excite,  And so prepare us, by a six-years' truce,  Again for riot, insult, and abuse.     Our worthy Mayor, on the victorious part,  Cries out for peace, and cries with all his heart;  He, civil creature! ever does his best  To banish wrath from every voter's breast;  \"For where,\" says he, with reason strong and plain,  \"Where is the profit? what will anger gain?\"  His short stout person he is wont to brace  In good brown broad-cloth, edg'd with two-inch lace,  When in his seat; and still the coat seems new,  Preserved by common use of seaman's blue.     He was a fisher from his earliest day,  And placed his nets within the Borough's bay;  Where, by his skates, his herrings, and his soles,  He lived, nor dream'd of Corporation-Doles;  But toiling saved, and saving, never ceased  Till he had box'd up twelvescore pounds at least:  He knew not money's power, but judged it best  Safe in his trunk to let his treasure rest;  Yet to a friend complain'd:  \"Sad charge, to keep  So many pounds; and then I cannot sleep:\"  \"Then put it out,\" replied the friend: --\"What, give  My money up? why then I could not live:\"  \"Nay, but for interest place it in his hands  Who'll give you mortgage on his house or lands.\"  \"Oh but,\" said Daniel, \"that's a dangerous plan;  He may be robb'd like any other man:\"  \"Still he is bound, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon — Complete (#8)"],[1,"the praetor's  lictor, whose duty it was to see that the names of strangers were entered  in his rolls, had seen two people come into the inn, whose names were not  yet entered, and that was the reason he had made inquiry as to their  names and means of support.  Mine host furnished this information in such  an offhand manner that I became suspicious as to our entire safety in his  house; so, in order to avoid arrest, we decided to go out, and not to  return home until after dark, and we sallied forth, leaving the  management of dinner to Giton.  As it suited our purpose to avoid the  public streets, we strolled through the more unfrequented parts of the  city, and just at dusk we met two women in stolas, in a lonely spot, and  they were by no means homely.  Walking softly, we followed them to a  temple which they entered, and from which we could hear a curious  humming, which resembled the sound of voices issuing from the depths of a  cavern.  Curiosity impelled us also to enter the temple.  There we caught  sight of many women, who resembled Bacchantes, each of whom brandished in  her right hand an emblem of Priapus.  We were not permitted to see more,  for as their eyes fell upon us, they raised such a hubbub that the vault  of the temple trembled.  They attempted to lay hands upon us, but we ran  back to our inn as fast as we could go.)          CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH.    We had just disposed of the supper prepared by Giton, when there came a  timid rapping at the door.  We turned pale.  \"Who is there?\"  we asked.  \"Open and you will find out,\" came the answer.  While we were speaking,  the bar fell down of its own accord, the doors flew open and admitted our  visitor.  She was the selfsame young lady of the covered head who had but  a little while before stood by the peasant's side.  \"So you thought,\"  said she, \"that you could make a fool of me, did you?  I am Quartilla's  handmaid: Quartilla, whose rites you interrupted in the shrine.  She has  come to the inn, in person, and begs permission to speak with you.  Don't  be alarmed!  She neither blames your mistake nor does she demand  punishment; on the contrary, she wonders what god has brought such  well-bred young gentlemen into her neighborhood!\"          CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH.    We were still holding our tongues and refraining from any expression of  opinion, when the lady herself entered the room, attended by a little  girl.  Seating herself upon the bed, she wept for a long time.  Not even  then did we interject a single word, but waited, all attention, for what  was to follow these well ordered tears and this show of grief.  When the  diplomatic thunderstorm had passed over, she withdrew her haughty head  from her mantle and, ringing her hands until the joints cracked, \"What is  the meaning of such audacity?\" she demanded; \"where did you learn such  tricks?  They are worthy of putting to shame the assurance of all the  robbers of the past!  I pity you, so help me the God of Truth, I do; for  no one can look with impunity upon that which it is unlawful for him to  see.  In our neighborhood, there are so many gods that it is easier to  meet one than it is to find a man!  But do not think that I was actuated  by any desire for revenge when I came here: I am more moved by your age  than I am by my own injury, for it is my belief that youthful imprudence  led you into committing a sacrilegious crime.  That very night, I tossed  so violently in the throes of a dangerous chill that I was afraid I had  contracted a tertian ague, and in my dreams I prayed for a medicine.  I  was ordered to seek you out, and to arrest the progress of the disease by  means of an expedient to be suggested by your wonderful penetration!  The  cure does not matter so much, however, for a deeper grief gnaws at my  vitals and drags me down, almost to the very doors of death itself.  I am  afraid that, with the careless impulsiveness of youth, you may divulge,  to the common herd, what you witnessed in the shrine of Priapus, and  reveal the rites of the gods to the rabble.  On this account, I stretch  out my suppliant hands to your knees, and beg and pray that you do not  make a mockery and a joke of our nocturnal rites, nor lay bare the  secrets of so many years, into which scarcely a thousand persons are  initiated.\"          CHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH.    The tears poured forth again, after this appeal, and, shaken by deep  sobs, she buried her whole face and breast in my bed; and I, moved by  pity and by apprehension, begged her to be of good cheer and to make  herself perfectly easy as to both of those issues, for not only would we  not betray any secrets to the rabble, but we would also second divine  providence, at any peril to ourselves, if any god had indicated to her  any cure for her tertian ague.  The woman cheered up at this promise, and  smothered me with kisses; from tears she passed to laughter, and fell to  running her fingers through the long hair that hung down about my ears.  \"I will declare a truce with you,\" she said, \"and withdraw my complaint.  But had you been unwilling to administer the medicine which I seek, I had  a troop in readiness for the morrow, which would have exacted  satisfaction for my injury and reparation for my dignity!              To be flouted is disgraceful, but to dictate terms, sublime              Pleased am I to choose what course I will,              Even sages will retort an insult at the proper tune.              Victor most is he who does not kill.\"    Then she suddenly clapped her hands, and broke into such a peal of  laughter that we were alarmed.  The maid, who had been the first to  arrive, did likewise, on one side of us, as also did the little girl who  had entered with the madame herself.          CHAPTER THE NINETEENTH.    The whole place was filled with mocking laughter, and we, who could see  no reason for such a change of front, stared blankly at each other and  then at the women.  (Then Quartilla spoke up, finally,) \"I gave orders  that no mortal man should be admitted into this inn, this day, so that I  could receive the treatment for my ague without interruption!\"  Ascyltos  was, for the moment, struck dumb by this admission of Quartilla's, and I  turned colder than a Gallic winter, and could not utter a word; but the  personnel of the company relieved me from the fear that the worst might  be yet to come, for they were only three young women, too weak to attempt  any violence against us, who were of the male sex, at least, even if we  had nothing else of the man about us, and this was an asset.  Then, too,  we were girded higher, and I had so arranged matters that if it came to a  fight, I would engage Quartilla myself, Ascyltos the maid, and Giton the  girl.  (While I was turning over this plan in my mind, Quartilla came to  close quarters, to receive the treatment for her ague, but having her  hopes disappointed, she flounced out in a rage and, returning in a little  while, she had us overpowered by some unknown vagabonds, and gave orders  for us to be carried away to a splendid palace.)  Then our determination  gave place to astonishment, and death, sure and certain, began to obscure  the eyes of suffering.          CHAPTER THE TWENTIETH.    \"Pray; madame,\" I groaned, \"if you have anything worse in store, bring it  on quickly for we have not committed a crime so heinous as to merit death  by torture.\"  The maid, whose name was Psyche, quickly spread a blanket  upon the floor (and) sought to secure an erection by fondling my member,  which was already a thousand times colder than death.  Ascyltos, well  aware by now of the danger of dipping into the secrets of others, covered  his head with his mantle.  (In the meantime,) the maid took two ribbons  from her bosom and bound our feet with one and our hands with the other.  (Finding myself trussed up in this fashion, I remarked, \"You will not be  able to cure your mistress' ague in this manner!\"  \"Granted,\" the maid  replied, \"but I have other and surer remedies at hand,\" she brought me a  vessel full of satyrion, as she said this, and so cheerfully did she  gossip about its virtues that I drank down nearly all of the liquor, and  because Ascyltos had but a moment before rejected her advances, she  sprinkled the dregs upon his back, without his knowing it.)  When this  repartee had drawn to a close, Ascyltos exclaimed, \"Don't I deserve a  drink?\"  Given away by my laughter, the maid clapped her hands and cried,  \"I put one by you, young man; did you drink so much all by yourself?\"  \"What's that you say?\", Quartilla chimed in.  \"Did Encolpius drink all  the satyrion there was in the house?\"  And she laughed delightfully until  her sides shook.  Finally not even Giton himself could resist a smile,  especially when the little girl caught him around the neck and showered  innumerable kisses upon him, and he not at all averse to it.          CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRST.    We would have cried aloud in our misery but there was no one to give us  any help, and whenever I attempted to shout, \"Help!  all honest  citizens,\" Psyche would prick my cheeks with her hairpin, and the little  girl would intimidate Ascyltos with a brush dipped in satyrion.  Then a  catamite appeared, clad in a myrtle-colored frieze robe, and girded round  with a belt.  One minute he nearly gored us to death with his writhing  buttocks, and the next, he befouled us so with his stinking kisses that  Quartilla, with her robe tucked high, held up her whalebone wand and  ordered him to give the unhappy wretches quarter.  Both of us then took a  most solemn oath that so dread a secret should perish with us.  Several  wrestling instructors appeared and refreshed us, worn out as we were, by  a massage with pure oil, and when our fatigue had abated, we again donned  our dining clothes and were escorted to the next room, in which were  placed three couches, and where all the essentials necessary to a  splendid "]]]
