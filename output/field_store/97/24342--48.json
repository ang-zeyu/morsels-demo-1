Further, as they  find in themselves and outside themselves many means which assist  them not a little in the search for what is useful, for instance,  eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, herbs and animals for  yielding food, the sun for giving light, the sea for breeding  fish, &c., they come to look on the whole of nature as a means  for obtaining such conveniences.  Now as they are aware, that  they found these conveniences and did not make them, they think  they have cause for believing, that some other being has made  them for their use.  As they look upon things as means, they  cannot believe them to be self--created; but, judging from the  means which they are accustomed to prepare for themselves, they  are bound to believe in some ruler or rulers of the universe  endowed with human freedom, who have arranged and adapted  everything for human use.  They are bound to estimate the nature  of such rulers (having no information on the subject) in  accordance with their own nature, and therefore they assert that  the gods ordained everything for the use of man, in order to bind  man to themselves and obtain from him the highest honor.  Hence  also it follows, that everyone thought out for himself, according  to his abilities, a different way of worshipping God, so that God  might love him more than his fellows, and direct the whole course  of nature for the satisfaction of his blind cupidity and  insatiable avarice.  Thus the prejudice developed into  superstition, and took deep root in the human mind; and for this  reason everyone strove most zealously to understand and explain  the final causes of things; but in their endeavor to show that  nature does nothing in vain, i.e. nothing which is useless to  man, they only seem to have demonstrated that nature, the gods,  and men are all mad together.  Consider, I pray you, the result:  among the many helps of nature they were bound to find some  hindrances, such as storms, earthquakes, diseases, &c.: so they  declared that such things happen, because the gods are angry at  some wrong done to them by men, or at some fault committed in  their worship.  Experience day by day protested and showed by  infinite examples, that good and evil fortunes fall to the lot of  pious and impious alike; still they would not abandon their  inveterate prejudice, for it was more easy for them to class such  contradictions among other unknown things of whose use they were  ignorant, and thus to retain their actual and innate condition of  ignorance, than to destroy the whole fabric of their reasoning  and start afresh.  They therefore laid down as an axiom, that  God's judgments far transcend human understanding.  Such a  doctrine might well have sufficed to conceal the truth from the  human race for all eternity, if mathematics had not furnished  another standard of verity in considering solely the essence and  properties of figures without regard to their final causes.  There are other reasons (which I need not mention here) besides  mathematics, which might have caused men's minds to be directed  to these general prejudices, and have led them to the knowledge  of the truth.    I have now sufficiently explained my first point.  There is  no need to show at length, that nature has no particular goal in  view, and that final causes are mere human figments.  This, I  think, is already evident enough, both from the causes and  foundations on which I have shown such prejudice to be based, and  also from Prop. xvi., and the Corollary of Prop. xxxii., and, in  fact, all those propositions in which I have shown, that  everything in nature proceeds from a sort of necessity, and with  the utmost perfection.  However, I will add a few remarks, in  order to overthrow this doctrine of a final cause utterly.  That  which is really a cause it considers as an effect, and vice versa:  it makes that which is by nature first to be last, and that  which is highest and most perfect to be most imperfect.  Passing  over the questions of cause and priority as self--evident, it is  plain from Props. xxi., xxii., xxiii. that the effect is most  perfect which is produced immediately by God; the effect which  requires for its production several intermediate causes is, in  that respect, more imperfect.  But if those things which were  made immediately by God were made to enable him to attain his  end, then the things which come after, for the sake of which the  first were made, are necessarily the most excellent of all.    Further, this doctrine does away with the perfection of God:  for, if God acts for an object, he necessarily desires something  which he lacks.  Certainly, theologians and metaphysicians draw a  distinction between the object of want and the object of  assimilation; still they confess that God made all things for  the sake of himself, not for the sake of creation.  They are  unable to point to anything prior to creation, except God  himself, as an object for which God should act, and are therefore  driven to admit (as they clearly must), that God lacked those  things for whose attainment he created means, and further that he  desired them.    We must not omit to notice that the followers of this  doctrine, anxious to display their talent in assigning final  causes, have imported a new method of argument in proof of their  theory--namely, a reduction, not to the impossible, but to  ignorance; thus showing that they have no other method of  exhibiting their doctrine.  For example, if a stone falls from a  roof on to someone's head, and kills him, they will demonstrate  by their new method, that the stone fell in order to kill the man;  for, if it had not by God's will fallen with that object, how  could so many circumstances (and there are often many concurrent  circumstances) have all happened together by chance?  Perhaps you  will answer that the event is due to the facts that the wind was  blowing, and the man was walking that way.  \"But why,\" they will  insist, \"was the wind blowing, and why was the man at that very  time walking that way?\"  If you again answer, that the wind had  then sprung up because the sea had begun to be agitated the day  before, the weather being previously calm, and that the man had  been invited by a friend, they will again insist: \"But why was  the sea agitated, and why was the man invited at that time?\"  So they will pursue their questions from cause to cause, till at  last you take refuge in the will of God--in other words, the  sanctuary of ignorance.  So, again, when they survey the frame of  the human body, they are amazed; and being ignorant of the  causes of so great a work of art, conclude that it has been  fashioned, not mechanically, but by divine and supernatural  skill, and has been so put together that one part shall not hurt  another.    Hence anyone who seeks for the true causes of miracles, and  strives to understand natural phenomena as an intelligent being,  and not to gaze at them like a fool, is set down and denounced as  an impious heretic by those, whom the masses adore as the  interpreters of nature and the gods.  Such persons know that,  with the removal of ignorance, the wonder which forms their only  available means for proving and preserving their authority would  vanish also.  But I now quit this subject, and pass on to my  third point.    After men persuaded themselves, that everything which is  created is created for their sake, they were bound to consider as  the chief quality in everything that which is most useful to  themselves, and to account those things the best of all which  have the most beneficial effect on mankind.  Further, they were  bound to form abstract notions for the explanation of the nature  of things, such as goodness, badness, order, confusion, warmth,  cold, beauty, deformity, and so on; and from the belief that  they are free agents arose the further notions of praise and  blame, sin and merit.    I will speak of these latter hereafter, when I treat of human  nature; the former I will briefly explain here.    Everything which conduces to health and the worship of God  they have called good, everything which hinders these objects  they have styled bad; and inasmuch as those who do not  understand the nature of things do not verify phenomena in any  way, but merely imagine them after a fashion, and mistake their  imagination for understanding, such persons firmly believe that  there is an order in things, being really ignorant both of things  and their own nature.  When phenomena are of such a kind, that  the impression they make on our senses requires little effort of  imagination, and can consequently be easily remembered, we say  that they are well--ordered; if the contrary, that they are  ill--ordered or confused.  Further, as things which are easily  imagined are more pleasing to us, men prefer order to  confusion--as though there were any order in nature, except in  relation to our imagination--and say that God has created all  things in order; thus, without knowing it, attributing  imagination to God, unless, indeed, they would have it that God  foresaw human imagination, and arranged everything, so that it  should be most easily imagined.  If this be their theory, they  would not, perhaps, be daunted by the fact that we find an  infinite number of phenomena, far surpassing our imagination, and  very many others which confound its weakness.  But enough has  been said on this subject.  The other abstract notions are  nothing but modes of imagining, in which the imagination is  differently affected: though they are considered by the ignorant  as the chief attributes of things, inasmuch as they believe that  everything was created for the sake of themselves; and,  according as they are affected by it, style it good or bad,  healthy or rotten and corrupt.

The nest is  generally composed of a few wisps of sea-weed or grass, or the two or  three eggs are not infrequently laid in a slight hollow in the sand or  among the shells and pebbles.    Like the Gulls, Terns have been slaughtered in enormous numbers for  millinery purposes; but in this country, at least, effective efforts  are now being made to preserve them.    Skimmers nest in numbers on our Atlantic Coast from Virginia  southward, laying their four eggs in a slight depression in the sand.  In feeding, their mouth is held open and the longer, thin, lower  mandible is dropped beneath the surface of the water, when, flying  rapidly, they readily pick up food.    In young Skimmers, however, the two mandibles are of equal length and  the lower mandible does not become appreciably longer than the upper  one until the birds begin to fly. During the flightless period of the  bird's life, the bill may be used to pick up food along the shore, but  when the power of flight is acquired and with it ability to feed in  the characteristic Skimmer manner, then the peculiar bill of these  birds becomes fully developed.    The young of all the Gulls and Terns are born covered with down and  can leave the nest a few hours after birth. The Noddy, however, is  said to be several weeks in its stick nest, which, unlike other  members of its group, it often builds in bushes.    The young are colored to harmonize with their usual surroundings.  Young Skimmers are pale, sandy brown, of the same color as the sand in  which they are hatched. Young Terns are darker, and young Laughing  Gulls born in nests of reeds or meadow grasses, are the darkest of the  three.    All young Gulls and Terns have the habit of squatting low near the  ground in the presence of danger and remaining motionless until  actually touched when they seem to realize that they have been seen  and trust to their legs for safety.
