Early the next morning the gazelle said to his master: \"Now I'm off on  a journey. I shall be gone about a week; but however long I am gone,  don't you leave the house till I return. Good-bye.\"    Then he went to the real sultan and said: \"Good master, Sultan Daaraaee  has ordered me to return to our town and put his house in order; he  commands me to be here again in a week; if I do not return by that  time, he will stay here until I come.\"    The sultan asked him if he would not like to have some soldiers go  with him; but the gazelle replied that he was quite competent to  take care of himself, as his previous journeys had proved, and he  preferred to go alone; so with mutual good wishes they parted.    But Keejeepaa did not go in the direction of the old village. He  struck off by another road through the forest, and after a time came  to a very fine town, of large, handsome houses. As he went through  the principal street, right to the far end, he was greatly astonished  to observe that the town seemed to have no inhabitants, for he saw  neither man, woman, nor child in all the place.    At the end of the main street he came upon the largest and most  beautiful house he had ever seen, built of sapphire, and turquoise,  and costly marbles.    \"Oh, my!\" said the gazelle; \"this house would just suit my master. I'll  have to pluck up my courage and see whether this is deserted like  the other houses in this mysterious town.\"    So Keejeepaa knocked at the door, and called, \"Hullo, there!\" several  times; but no one answered. And he said to himself: \"This is  strange! If there were no one inside, the door would be fastened  on the outside. Perhaps they are in another part of the house, or  asleep. I'll call again, louder.\"    So he called again, very loud and long, \"Hul-lo, th-e-re! Hul-lo!\" And  directly an old woman inside answered, \"Who is that calling so loudly?\"    \"It is I, your grandchild, good mistress,\" said Keejeepaa.    \"If you are my grandchild,\" replied the old woman, \"go back to your  home at once; don't come and die here, and bring me to my death also.\"    \"Oh, come,\" said he, \"open the door, mistress; I have just a few  words I wish to say to you.\"    \"My dear grandson,\" she replied, \"the only reason why I do not open  the door is because I fear to endanger both your life and my own.\"    \"Oh, don't worry about that; I guess your life and mine are safe enough  for a while. Open the door, anyhow, and hear the little I have to say.\"    So the old woman opened the door.    Then they exchanged salutations and compliments, after which she  asked the gazelle, \"What's the news from your place, grandson?\"    \"Oh, everything is going along pretty well,\" said he; \"what's the  news around here?\"    \"Ah!\" sighed the old creature; \"the news here is very bad. If you're  looking for a place to die in, you've struck it here. I've not the  slightest doubt you'll see all you want of death this very day.\"    \"Huh!\" replied Keejeepaa, lightly; \"for a fly to die in honey is not  bad for the fly, and doesn't injure the honey.\"    \"It may be all very well for you to be easy about it,\" persisted the  old person; \"but if people with swords and shields did not escape,  how can a little thing like you avoid danger? I must again beg of  you to go back to the place you came from. Your safety seems of more  interest to me than it is to you.\"    \"Well, you see, I can't go back just now; and besides, I want to find  out more about this place. Who owns it?\"    \"Ah, grandson, in this house are enormous wealth, numbers of people,  hundreds of horses, and the owner is Neeo'ka Mkoo', the wonderfully  big snake. He owns this whole town, also.\"    \"Oho! Is that so?\" said Keejeepaa. \"Look here, old lady; can't you  put me on to some plan of getting near this big snake, that I may  kill him?\"    \"Mercy!\" cried the old woman, in affright; \"don't talk like  that. You've put my life in danger already, for I'm sure Neeoka Mkoo  can hear what is said in this house, wherever he is. You see I'm a  poor old woman, and I have been placed here, with those pots and pans,  to cook for him. Well, when the big snake is coming, the wind begins  to blow and the dust flies as it would do in a great storm. Then,  when he arrives in the courtyard, he eats until he is full, and  after that, goes inside there to drink water. When he has finished,  he goes away again. This occurs every other day, just when the sun  is overhead. I may add that Neeoka Mkoo has seven heads. Now, then,  do you think yourself a match for him?\"    \"Look here, mother,\" said the gazelle, \"don't you worry about me. Has  this big snake a sword?\"    \"He has. This is it,\" said she, taking from its peg a very keen  and beautiful blade, and handing it to him; \"but what's the use in  bothering about it? We are dead already.\"    \"We shall see about that,\" said Keejeepaa.    Just at that moment the wind began to blow, and the dust to fly,  as if a great storm were approaching.    \"Do you hear the great one coming?\" cried the old woman.    \"Pshaw!\" said the gazelle; \"I'm a great one also--and I have the  advantage of being on the inside. Two bulls can't live in one  cattle-pen. Either he will live in this house, or I will.\"    Notwithstanding the terror the old lady was in, she had to smile at  the assurance of this little undersized gazelle, and repeated over  again her account of the people with swords and shields who had been  killed by the big snake.    \"Ah, stop your gabbling!\" said the gazelle; \"you can't always judge  a banana by its color or size. Wait and see, grandma.\"    In a very little while the big snake, Neeoka Mkoo, came into the  courtyard, and went around to all the pots and ate their contents. Then  he came to the door.    \"Hullo, old lady,\" said he; \"how is it I smell a new kind of odor  inside there?\"    \"Oh, that's nothing, good master,\" replied the old woman; \"I've been  so busy around here lately I haven't had time to look after myself;  but this morning I used some perfume, and that's what you smell.\"    Now, Keejeepaa had drawn the sword, and was standing just inside  the doorway; so, when the big snake put his head in, it was cut off  so quickly that its owner did not know it was gone. When he put in  his second head it was cut off with the same quickness; and, feeling  a little irritation, he exclaimed, \"Who's inside there, scratching  me?\" He then thrust in his third head, and that was cut off also.    This continued until six heads had been disposed of, when Neeoka Mkoo  unfolded his rings and lashed around so that the gazelle and the old  woman could not see one another through the dust.    Then the snake thrust in his seventh head, and the gazelle, crying:  \"Now your time has come; you've climbed many trees, but this you can  not climb,\" severed it, and immediately fell down in a fainting fit.    Well, that old woman, although she was seventy-five years of age,  jumped, and shouted, and laughed, like a girl of nine. Then she ran  and got water, and sprinkled the gazelle, and turned him this way  and that way, until at last he sneezed; which greatly pleased the  old person, who fanned him and tended him until he was quite recovered.    \"Oh, my!\" said she; \"who would have thought you could be a match for  him, my grandson?\"    \"Well, well,\" said Keejeepaa; \"that's all over. Now show me everything  around this place.\"    So she showed him everything, from top to bottom: store-rooms  full of goods, chambers full of expensive foods, rooms containing  handsome people who had been kept prisoners for a long time, slaves,  and everything.    Next he asked her if there was any person who was likely to lay  claim to the place or make any trouble; and she answered: \"No one;  everything here belongs to you.\"    \"Very well, then,\" said he, \"you stay here and take care of these  things until I bring my master. This place belongs to him now.\"    Keejeepaa stayed three days examining the house, and said to himself:  \"Well, when my master comes here he will be much pleased with what I  have done for him, and he'll appreciate it after the life he's been  accustomed to. As to his father-in-law, there is not a house in his  town that can compare with this.\"    On the fourth day he departed, and in due time arrived at the  town where the sultan and his master lived. Then there were great  rejoicings; the sultan being particularly pleased at his return,  while his master felt as if he had received a new lease of life.    After everything had settled down a little, Keejeepaa told his master  he must be ready to go, with his wife, to his new home after four  days. Then he went and told the sultan that Sultan Daaraaee desired  to take his wife to his own town in four days; to which the sultan  strongly objected; but the gazelle said it was his master's wish,  and at last everything was arranged.    On the day of the departure a great company assembled to escort Sultan  Daaraaee and his bride. There were the bride's ladies-in-waiting,  and slaves, and horsemen, and Keejeepaa leading them all.    So they traveled three days, resting when the sun was overhead, and  stopping each evening about five o'clock to eat and sleep; arising  next morning at day-break, eating, and going forward again. And all  this time the gazelle took very little rest, going all through the  company, from the ladies to the slaves, and seeing that every one was  well supplied with food and quite comfortable; therefore the entire  company loved him and valued him like the apples of their eyes.    On the fourth day, during the afternoon, many houses came into  view, and some of the folks called Keejeepaa's attention to  them. \"Certainly,\" said he; \"that is our town, and that house you  see yonder is the palace of Sultan Daaraaee.\"    So they went on, and all the company filed into the courtyard, while  the gazelle and his master went"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],[0,"The Psychology of Beauty (#8)"],[1,"how to translate unity and self-completeness into  psychological terms.    The psychological organism is in a state of unity either when  it is in a state of virtual congealment or emptiness, as in a  trance or ecstasy; or when it is in a state of repose, without  tendency to change.  Secondly, the organism is self-complete when  it is at the highest possible point of tone, of functional  efficiency, of enhanced life.  Then a combination of favorable  stimulation and repose would characterize the aesthetic feeling.    But it may be said that stimulation and repose are contradictory  concepts, and we must indeed admit that the absolute repose of  the hypnotic trance is not aesthetic, because empty of stimulus.  The only aesthetic repose is that in which stimulation resulting  in impulse to movement or action is checked or compensated for  by its antagonistic impulse; inhibition of action, or action  returning upon itself, combined with heightening of tone.  But  this is TENSION, EQUILIBRIUM, or BALANCE OF FORCES, which is thus  seen to be A GENERAL CONDITION OF ALL AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE.  The  concept is familiar in pictorial composition and to some extent  also in music and poetry, but here first appears as grounded in  the very demand for the union of repose with activity.    Moreover, this requirement, which we have derived from the  logical concepts of unity and totality, as translated into  psychological terms, receives confirmation from the nature of  organic life.  It was the perfect moment that we sought, and we  found it in the immediate experience of unity and self-completeness;  and unity for a living being CAN only be equilibrium.  Now it  appears that an authoritative definition of the general nature of  an organism makes it \"so built, whether on mechanical principles  or not, that every deviation from the equilibrium point sets up  a tendency to return to it.\"<1>  Equilibrium, in greater or less  excursions from the centre, is thus the ultimate nature of  organic life.  The perfect equilibrium, that is, equilibrium with  heightened tone, will then give the perfect moment.    <1>  L.T. Hobhouse, _Mind in Evolution_.    The further steps of aesthetics are then toward analysis of the  psychological effect of all the elements which enter into a  work of art, with reference to their effect in producing  stimulation or repose.  What colors, forms, tones, emotions,  ideas, favorably stimulate?  What combinations of these bring  to repose?  All the modern studies in so-called physiological  aesthetics, into the emotional and other--especially motor--  effects of color, tone-sensation, melodic sequence, simple  forms, etc., find here there proper place.    A further important question, as to the fitting psychological  designation of the aesthetic state, is now suggested.  Some  authorities speak of the aesthetic attitude or activity,  describing it as \"sympathetic imitation\" or \"absorption;\"  others of the aesthetic pleasure.  But, according to our  definition of the aesthetic experience as a combination of  favorable stimulation with repose, this state, as involving  \"a distinctive feeling-tone and a characteristic trend of  activity aroused by a certain situation,\"<1> can be no other  than an emotion.  This view is confirmed by introspection; we  speak of aesthetic activity and aesthetic pleasure, but we  are conscious of a complete arrest, and sometimes of a very  distinct divergence from pure pleasure.  The experience is  unique, it seems to defy description, to be intense, vivid,  and yet--like itself alone.  Any attempt to disengage special,  already known emotions, even at the play or in hearing music,  is often in vain, in just those moments when our excitement is  most intense.  But the hypothesis of a unique emotion, parallel  to those of joy, fear, etc., and with a psychological basis as  outlined, would account for these facts.  The positive toning  of the experience--what we call aesthetic pleasure--is due not  only to the favorable stimulation, but also to the fact that  the very antagonism of impulses which constitutes repose  heightens tone while it inhibits action.  Thus the conditions  of both factors of aesthetic emotion tend to induct pleasure.    <1> Baldwin's _Dict. Of Phil. And Psychol._  Art.  \"Emotion.\"    It is, then, clear that no specific aesthetic pleasure need be  sought.  The very phrase, indeed, is a misnomer, since all  pleasure is qualitatively the same, and differentiated only  by the specific activities which it accompanies.  It is also  to be noted that those writers on aesthetics who have dwelt  most on aesthetic pleasure have come in conclusion only to  specific activities, like the \"imitation\" of Groos, for instance.  In the light of the just-won definition of aesthetic emotion,  it is interesting to examine some of the well-known modern  aesthetic theories.    Lipps defines the aesthetic experience as a \"thrill of sympathetic  feeling,\" Groos as \"sympathetic imitation,\" evidently assuming  that pleasure accompanies this.  But there are many feelings of  sympathy, and joyful ones, which do not belong to the aesthetic  realm.  In the same way, not all \"imitation\" is accompanied by  pleasure, and not all of that falls within the generally accepted  aesthetic field.  If these definitions were accepted as they  stand, all our rejoicings with friends, all our inspiration from  a healthy, magnetic presence must be included in it.  It is clear  that further limitation is necessary; but if to this sympathetic  imitation, this living through in sympathy, we add the demand  for repose, the necessary limitation is made.  Physical exercise  in general, or the instinctive imitation of energetic, or easy  (in general FAVORABLE) movements, is pleasurable, indeed, but  the experience is not aesthetic,--as is quite clear, indeed, to  common sense,--and it is not aesthetic because it is the  contradiction of repose.  A particular case of the transformation  of pleasurable physical exercise into an aesthetic activity is  seen in the experience of symmetrical or balanced form; any  moderate, smooth exercise of the eye is pleasurable, but this  alone induces a state of the whole organism combining repose with  stimulation.    The theories of Kulpe and Santayana, while they definitely mark  out the ground, seem to me in need of addition.  \"Absorption in  the object in respect to its bare quality and conformation\" does  not, of course, give the needed information, for objective beauty,  of the character of this conformation or form.  But yet, it might  be said that the content of beauty might conceivably be deduced  from the psychological conditions of absorption.  In the same  way, Santayana's \"Beauty as objectified pleasure,\" or pleasure as  the quality of a thing, is neither a determination of objective  beauty nor a sufficient description of the psychological state.  Yet analysis of those qualities in the thing that cause us to  make our pleasure a quality of it would supplement the definition  sufficiently and completely in the sense of our own formula.  Why  do we regard pleasure as the quality of a thing?  Because there  is something in the thing that makes us spread, as it were, our  pleasure upon it.  This is that which fixates us, arrests us,  upon it,--which can be only the elements that make for repose.    Guyau, however, comes nearest to our point of view.  \"The beautiful  is a perception or an action which stimulates life within us under  its three forms simultaneously (i.e., sensibility, intelligence,  and will) and produces pleasure by the swift consciousness of this  general stimulation.\"<1>  It is from this general stimulation that  Guyau explains the aesthetic effect of his famous drink of milk  among mountain scenes.  But such general stimulation might  accompany successful action of any kind, and thus the moral and  the aesthetic would fall together.  That M. Guyau is so successful  in his analysis is due rather to the fact that just this diffused  stimulation is likely to come from such exercise as is  characterized by the mutual checking of antagonistic impulses  producing an equilibrium.  The diffusion of stimulation would be  our formula for the aesthetic state only if interpreted as  stimulation arresting action.    <1>  _Problemes de l'Esthetique Contemporaine_ 1902, p. 77.    The diffusion of stimulation, the equilibrium of impulses, life-  enhancement through repose!--this is the aesthetic experience.  But how, then, it will be asked, are we to interpret the temporal  arts?  A picture or a statue maybe understood through this formula,  but hardly a drama or a symphony.  If the form of the one is  symmetry, hidden or not, would not the form of the other be  represented by a straight line?  That which has beginning, middle,  and end is not static but dynamic.    Let us consider once more the concept of equilibrium.  Inhibition  of action through antagonistic impulses, or action returning upon  itself, we have defined it; and the line cannot be drawn sharply  between these types.  The visual analogue for equilibrium may be  either symmetrical figure or circle; the excursion from the  centre may be either the swing of the pendulum or the sweep of  the planet.  The RETURN is the essential.  Now it is a commonplace  of criticism--though the significance of the dictum has never been  sufficiently seen--that the great drama, novel, or symphony does  return upon itself.  The excursion is merely longer, of a different  order of impulses from that of the picture. The last note is the  only possible answer to the first; it contains the first.  The  last scene has meaning only as the satisfaction of the first.  The  measure of the perfection of a work of temporal art is thus its  IMPLICIT character.  The end is contained in the beginning--that  is the meaning of \"inevitableness.\"    That the constraining power of drama or symphony is just this  sense of urgency, of"]]]
