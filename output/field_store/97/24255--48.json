SPECIES ACCOUNTS      Large Whales With a Dorsal Fin          BLUE WHALE (B)[9]    _Balaenoptera musculus_ (Linnaeus 1758)    [Footnote 9: The letter in parentheses indicates whether the species is  a baleen (B) or a toothed (T) whale.]      Other Common Names    Sulphur-bottom.      Description    Blue whales are the largest living mammals. Though reports of maximum  length and weight vary from one account to another, Antarctic blue  whales are known to have reached lengths to 100 feet (30.5 m) and  weights of over 150 tons (136,363 kg)[10] before stocks were severely  depleted by whaling operations. North Atlantic blue whales may be  expected to reach lengths of 80-85 feet (24.4-25.9 m). In all known  populations of blue whales, females are slightly larger than males of  the same age.    [Footnote 10: The largest measured specimen was \"just over\" 100 feet  (30.5 m); the largest specimen weighed, the 150-ton individual noted  above, was 89 feet (27.1 m) long.]    Viewed from above, the blue whale's rostrum is broad, flat, and nearly  U-shaped (actually shaped like a Gothic arch, slightly flattened on the  tip), with a single ridge extending from the raised area just in front  of the blowholes towards but not quite reaching the tip of the snout.    The dorsal fin is extremely small [to only 13 inches (33 cm)] and  variable in shape from nearly triangular to moderately falcate. In all  cases, it is located so far back on the animal's tail stock that it is  seldom visible until the animal is about to begin a dive.    Blue whales are light bluish gray overall, mottled with gray or grayish  white. Some animals may have yellowish or mustard coloration, primarily  on the belly, the result of the accumulation of diatoms during long  stays in the cooler waters to the north. The undersides of the flippers  are light grayish blue to white.    The baleen plates are all black.      Natural History Notes    The blow or \"spout\" is tall, to perhaps 30 feet (9.1 m), slender,  vertical, and not bushy, as is the blow of humpback whales, for  instance.    Although the blowing and diving patterns of blue whales may vary,  depending on the speed of movement and the activity of the whale when it  is encountered, they may be generally described as follows: If the  animal is moving slowly, the blowhole and part of the head may still be  visible when the dorsal fin breaks the surface, and the animal may  settle quietly into the water without exposing the last portion of the  tail stock or the tail flukes. If the animal is moving more quickly,  however, or is about to begin a long dive, the blowhole disappears below  the surface, a broad expanse of the back is exposed and disappears, and  the dorsal fin emerges briefly just before the animal lifts its tail  stock and flukes slightly above the surface before slipping out of  sight.    In this species it can be generally stated that the maximum height of  back in the area of the dorsal fin which is exposed above the surface as  the animal sounds is approximately four times the height of the dorsal  fin itself. The exposure of the tail flukes is unlike that of the  humpback whale (Fig. 39), the right whale (Fig. 50), or the sperm whale  (Fig. 57) in that when beginning a long dive all these other species  raise the flukes high out of the water and usually descend at a steep  angle. Blue whales lift the flukes only slightly, if at all.    Blue whales are relatively shallow feeders, feeding as they do almost  exclusively on \"krill\" (small shrimplike crustaceans), most of which are  distributed in the surface 330 feet (100 m). Blue whales usually occur  singly or in pairs.      May Be Confused With    At sea, blue whales may be confused with fin whales (p. 26) and though  the two are sometimes difficult to distinguish from a distance, the  following key differences permit identification at close range:               BLUE WHALE                           FIN WHALE                                    COLORATION      Mottled bluish gray above            Gray above, white below; frequently    and below.                           grayish-white chevron                                         behind head, right lower                                         lip white.

See also comparison of fin whale and sei whale (p. 26).      Distribution    Though blue whales have been reported from the pack ice to Cristobal  Harbor, Panama Canal Zone, their normal range in the western North  Atlantic is more limited. In spring and summer months (about April  through at least August) they can be expected in the northern portion of  their range, at least as far north as the Arctic Circle, feeding on the  krill abundant in those waters. A small portion of the population may  venture north, beyond the Circle. In fall and winter the population  moves south, presumably into temperate and perhaps to tropical waters.  Reliable records include animals from observations off Long Island and  Ocean City, Md.    Though southern limits of the species are poorly known, there are no  records from Florida or the West Indies and no verified records from the  Gulf of Mexico.    Summaries of blue whale distribution based on records when the species  was more numerous indicate that they were found during spring and summer  months in some abundance on the Nova Scotian Banks, the St. Lawrence  Gulf and estuary, the Strait of Belle Isle, Grand Bank, and in the  waters off the coasts of Iceland, southern Greenland, and the Davis  Straits and Baffin Bay. (Some individuals have entered the Hudson Strait  but not apparently Hudson Bay itself.)    Historically, a few animals apparently appeared off the coast of  southeastern Canada as early as February. It was speculated that from  there a portion of the population underwent a migration from the Strait  of Belle Isle north through the Davis Straits to the waters off western  Greenland. Some individuals entered the Gulf of St. Lawrence after the  ice was clear and remained behind until as late as November. In the fall  months, certainly by November, the northern portion of the population  had begun retreating to the south in front of the advancing ice. The  remainder apparently also underwent this migration as well, since blue  whales have historically been nearly absent from Canadian waters during  midwinter.    Many of the migrating individuals were assumed to continue south to  temperate and, less frequently, to tropical water where they calved. It  should be emphasized that though all of the southward and the subsequent  northward migrations were presumed to be along pelagic routes, details  were poorly documented.    Blue whales have been reported in both shallow inshore and deep oceanic  zones.    Despite considerable attention in the popular literature to the plight  of the blue whale populations and frequent statements that they are near  extinction, blue whale stocks in the western North Atlantic appear more  abundant than has been usually reported. While present stocks are far  short of previous population sizes, which may have exceeded 200,000  individuals worldwide, they should "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33543"],[0,"The Amphibians and Reptiles of Michoacán, México (#8)"],[1,"(op.  cit.: 324) stated that the extent as well as the presence or absence of  ventral glands was highly variable in all samples examined by them.    Upon seeing numerous living individuals of _Leptodactylus melanonotus_  from many parts of its range in Mexico and individuals of the population  of _Leptodactylus_ in northwestern Mexico (Nayarit and Sinaloa), I was  immediately impressed not so much by the differences in the development  of the ventral glands, but by the color of the glands. The differences  in color are apparent in freshly preserved specimens. With the exception  of _Leptodactylus_ from northwestern Mexico, specimens of _melanonotus_  from throughout Mexico and northern Central America have yellow or  yellowish brown glands. Specimens from northwestern Mexico have black or  brownish black glands that are conspicuously darker than those found in  _melanonotus_. Examination of 653 preserved specimens of _Leptodactylus  melanonotus_ from Mexico and Guatemala has failed to reveal specimens  with black ventral glands, like those found in specimens from  northwestern Mexico, to which the name _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ has  been applied. Furthermore, in _melanonotus_ the glands are less distinct  and more extensive than in _occidentalis_; in the latter species glands  are absent from the throat and midventral area, where they often are  present in _melanonotus_ (Fig. 7).    In some individuals of both species collected in the dry season and in  some collected in the rainy (breeding) season the glands are absent; the  development of these glands, therefore, does not seem to be correlated  with breeding. Likewise, the glands are present or absent in either sex,  and often as not they are present in juveniles. Presence of the glands,  therefore, cannot be correlated either with sexual or ontogenetic  development. Since the glands are found in individuals from all parts of  the range, it is unlikely that there is a correlation between the  development of the glands and the environment.    [Illustration: FIG. 7. Diagrammatic view of ventral surfaces of  _Leptodactylus melanonotus_ (A) and _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ (B),  showing usual position and size of glandular areas. Approx. natural  size.]    Aside from the differences in the ventral glands, the call is different  in the two populations. The call of _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ is a  rather harsh \"wack, wack, wack\" as contrasted with the more nasal  \"woink, woink, woink\" of _melanonotus_. Sound spectrographs are needed  to analyze the differences in calls. None of the specimens of  _occidentalis_ examined approaches in size the largest individuals of  _melanonotus_; possibly the size of the frogs is another valid character  for separating the species. On the basis of the above data it is evident  that the frogs in northwestern Mexico show certain characters that  distinguish them from _Leptodactylus melanonotus_, as it is known  throughout the rest of Mexico. It is not known for certain that  _melanonotus_ and _occidentalis_ are sympatric. Several series of old,  poorly preserved specimens from Nayarit and Sinaloa cannot be placed in  either species, for none has visible ventral glands. _Leptodactylus  melanonotus_ is known from Acaponeta, Nayarit (AMNH 43913-25), and the  following localities in Jalisco: Barro de Navidad (UMMZ 118098), La  Concepcion (UMMZ 113081), La Resolana (UMMZ 102104), and Tenachitlan  (UMMZ 113045-6). Records for _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ are: Alamos,  Sonora (AMNH 51356-65); Culiacan (AMNH 49511-9), Chele (UMMZ 110914),  and Rosario (UMMZ 113062) in Sinaloa; Ixtlan del Rio (UMMZ 102108), San  Blas (UMMZ 112814, 112994, 110892, 115543), and Tepic (UMMZ 115544) in  Nayarit; Ameca (UMMZ 102106-7) and La Cofradia on the south shore of  Lago de Chapala (UMMZ 102105) in Jalisco; and Tangamandapio, Michoacan  (UMMZ 119145). From these scattered records it appears that  _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ in the southern part of its range stays in  the uplands, whereas _melanonotus_ is confined to the lowlands.      ~Microbatrachylus hobartsmithi~ (Taylor)         _Eleutherodactylus hobartsmithi_ Taylor, Trans.

Cascada Tzararacua (6); 21 km. W of Ciudad Hidalgo; 29 km. E       of Morelia; Puerto Hondo; San Jose de la Cumbre (13);       Uruapan (2); Zitacuaro.    Of six specimens from Cascada Tzararacua, five are colored like typical  _M. hobartsmithi_, having the anterior and posterior surfaces of the  thighs and the upper arms pale pink in life and a grayish brown dorsum  in preservative. The other specimen (UMMZ 94231) has in preservative a  dark brown dorsolateral line on each side enclosing a pale tan area that  extends from the snout to the vent. One specimen from 29 kilometers east  of Morelia (UIMNH 40338) and 13 specimens from San Jose de la Cumbre  (UMMZ 102111) do not have the prominent tarsal tubercles characteristic  of _M. hobartsmithi_. Also, in these fourteen specimens the palmar  tubercles are larger, and the dark anal patch more distinct, than in  typical _M. hobartsmithi_. Possibly these specimens, which are from the  high mountains in the eastern part of Michoacan, represent another  species of _Microbatrachylus_. However, Taylor (1940d:501) reported a  series of _M. hobartsmithi_ from the mountains 10 miles west of Villa  Victoria in the western part of the state of Mexico.    The largest specimen from Michoacan is a gravid female (UIMNH 16104)  having a snout-vent length of 23.5 mm.    _Microbatrachylus hobartsmithi_ has been found in rocky ravines along  streams in the Cordillera Volcanica and the southwestern escarpment of  these mountains at elevations from 1450 to 2750 meters.      ~Microbatrachylus pygmaeus~ (Taylor)         _Eleutherodactylus pygmaeus_ Taylor, Trans.

Bull.,       28:70, May 15, 1942.--La Esperanza, Chiapas, Mexico.         Arteaga (328).    This large series (UMMZ 119247-8) was collected on June 22 and 23, 1958,  before the onset of the heavy summer rains. The frogs were found in a  shaded ravine at the north edge of Arteaga; they were obtained during  the day, at which time they were actively moving about in the leaf  litter along a small stream.    These frogs are all referred to _M. pygmaeus_, because this is the  earliest name available for frogs showing the variation in  characteristics displayed by this large series. The characters used by  Taylor (1936a, 1940d, 1941a, and 1942b) and Smith and Taylor (1948) to  distinguish the various species of _Microbatrachylus_ include color  pattern, relative length of the hind limb, presence and position of  dorsal dermal folds or pustules, relative size of inner and outer  metatarsal tubercles, and the number of palmar tubercles. All specimens  from Arteaga have two palmar tubercles; the inner and outer metatarsal  tubercles are subequal in size. Furthermore, aside from sexual  difference, there is little variation in the relative length of the hind  limbs (Table 3). However, many color patterns do exist in the series;  each of these color patterns is described below.
