Elliott from Happy Lake,  Olympic Mts., Clallam Co., Washington.    _Range._--Washington from the Cascades west; southwestern British  Columbia west of 120 deg. W Longitude north to Lund.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the species; average and extreme  measurements of 20 specimens from the Olympic Mountains, Washington,  are: total length, 117.3 (107-125); tail, 49.8 (41-54); hind foot,  13.4 (12-14). Color dark in both summer and winter.    _Comparisons._--For comparison with _permiliensis_ see account of that  subspecies. Darker, longer-tailed, and somewhat larger cranially than  _S. v. obscurus_ with which it intergrades in southwestern British  Columbia. Smaller in all dimensions, but much the same color as _S. v.  longicauda_ with which it intergrades along the British Columbian  coast north of Lund. Larger, darker, less reddish, and longer-tailed  than the sympatric _S. v. vagrans_.    _Remarks._--_S. v. setosus_ lives mostly in forests. According to  Dalquest (1948:139) it is commonest at high altitudes in western  Washington. In the Hudsonian Life-zone where shrew habitat is more  restricted and marginal than it is at lower altitudes in the humid  part of Washington, _setosus_ might be expected to compete with _S. v.  vagrans_ and to supplant it. Records of occurrence in the Olympic  Mountains suggest a degree of such separation there.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 135.

Color dark in summer and winter.    _Comparisons._--For comparison with _S. v. setosus_ see account of  that subspecies. Larger and darker than _S. v. obscurus_ with which it  intergrades east of the humid coastal region; larger and darker than  _S. v. alascensis_ with which it intergrades in the Lynn Canal area;  larger and darker than _S. v. calvertensis_ which occurs on Calvert  Island and Banks Island, British Columbia; differs from _S. v.  insularis_ of Smythe, Townsend, and Reginald islands in larger size  and blackish rather than brown winter pelage; larger and relatively  longer-tailed than _S. v. elassodon_ which occurs on most of the  islands west of the range of _longicauda_; larger and relatively  longer-tailed than _S. v. isolatus_.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 151.

Vert. Zool.;  obtained on May 4, 1936, by R. A. Cumming, from Vanada, Texada Island,  Georgia Strait, British Columbia.    _Range._--Known only from the type locality.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium; average and extreme measurements of 5  specimens from the type locality are: total length, 111 (108-117);  tail, 48 (44-49); hind foot, 12 (12-13) (Hall, 1938:463).    _Comparisons._--Color much as in _S. v. setosus_ or _S. v. isolatus_;  palate longer than that of _isolatus_ or _setosus_; hind foot shorter  than either; smaller than _S. v. longicauda_.      =Sorex vagrans isolatus= Jackson        _Sorex obscurus isolatus_ Jackson, Jour. Washington Acad.      Sci., 12:263, June 14, 1922.    _Type._--Adult male, skin and skull; No. 177719, U. S. Biol. Surv.  Coll.; obtained on May 21, 1911, by Alexander Wetmore from mouth of  Millstone Creek, Nanaimo, Vancouver Island, British Columbia.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38398"],[0,"Amphibians and Reptiles of the Rainforests of Southern El Petén, Guatemala (#8)"],[1," When I approached, the lizard  turned its flanks towards me; then it flattened the body laterally,  extended the dewlap, opened its mouth, and made short rushing motions.  When touched it bit viciously. On the ground these lizards have a rather  awkward bipedal gait that is much slower than in _Basiliscus vittatus_.    In life an adult male (KU 55804) was reddish brown dorsally with dark  chocolate brown markings; the venter was creamy white, and the iris was  dark red. The natives call this lizard _piende jente_.      =Iguana iguana rhinolopha= Wiegmann          Rio San Roman, 2.    The _iguana_, as this lizard is called locally, seems to be uncommon in  the forested areas of southern El Peten. Possibly this is due to the  fact that the flesh of this lizard is relished as food by the natives.  My two specimens were in large trees at the edge of the river.      =Laemanctus deborrei= Boulenger          Chinaja, 1; Toocog, 5.    On June 26 a female having a snout-vent length of 129 mm. and a tail  length of 502 mm. was found on a bush in the forest. The lizard, when  approached, faced the collector and opened its mouth. In life the dorsum  was bright green; the lateral stripe was white, and the iris was  yellowish brown. This specimen contained four ova having lengths of 13.4  to 14.2 (average 13.9) mm.    On June 30 at Toocog five white-shelled eggs were found in a rotting  log. Measurements of the eggs are--length, 23.5 to 25.0 (average 24.2)  mm.; width, 15.0 to 15.5 (average 15.4) mm. These eggs hatched on August  30. The five young had snout-vent lengths of 43 to 45 (average 44) mm.,  and tail lengths of 137 to 140 (average 138) mm. In life the hatchlings  had a dull dark green dorsum, pale bright green venter and stripes on  head, and reddish brown iris. In preservative the hatchlings are creamy  tan above with five or six square dark brown blotches middorsally.    The natives consider this lizard to be one of the anoles; consequently,  it is known as _toloque_.      =Lepidophyma flavimaculatum flavimaculatum= Dumeril          Chinaja, 8; 15 km. NW of Chinaja, 2.    Individuals were found beneath logs on the forest floor or moving about  in the litter on the forest floor. One was observed crawling across a  trail during a heavy rain. In some adults the tan dorsal spots are large  and distinct; in others the spots are small and indistinct. Two  juveniles, apparently recent hatchlings, were found on June 28 and July  5. These specimens have snout-vent lengths of 29 mm. and tail lengths of  38 and 41 mm.      =Eumeces schwartzei= Fischer          Chinaja, 1.    One specimen (KU 59551) was found on the forest floor at midday; it is  an adult female having a snout-vent length of 125 mm. and a tail length  of 210 mm. This specimen is larger than those recorded by Taylor  (1936:99) and extends the known range of the species south of Ramate,  approximately 125 kilometers south-south-westward to Chinaja.      =Eumeces sumichrasti= (Cope)          20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1.    One adult male having a snout-vent length of 82 mm. was found beneath a  palm frond on the forest floor. In life the dorsum was dull brown; the  chin was cream; the belly was yellow, and the underside of the tail was  orange. A juvenile having a black body, yellow dorsal stripes, and a  bright blue tail was observed on the forest floor.      =Scincella cherriei cherriei= (Cope)          Chinaja, 2; 30 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1; Toocog, 1.    All individuals of this lizard were found in the leaf litter on the  forest floor; many escaped capture. In life the tail is dull bluish  gray. The number of dorsal scales varies from 59 to 61 (average 60);  thus, these specimens fall within the range of variation of _S. cherriei  cherriei_, and thereby differ from _S. cherriei stuarti_ to the west and  _S. cherriei ixbaac_ to the north.      =Ameiva festiva edwardsi= Bocourt          Chinaja, 16; 15 km. NW of Chinaja, 10; Sayache, 4; Toocog, 1.    This abundant terrestrial lizard, locally called _lagartijo_, is found  throughout the forest. A juvenile obtained on March 14 at Sayaxche has a  snout-vent length of 42 mm. and a prominent umbilical scar. Other  juveniles were observed at Chinaja in February and March, thereby  indicating that the young probably hatch in the early part of the year.  Juveniles have bright blue tails.      =Celestus rozellae= Smith          20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 2.    Two specimens were obtained from trees by workmen in February. These  lizards have snout-vent lengths of 70 and 83 mm. and tail lengths of 133  and 135 mm. There are 21 and 23 lamellae beneath the fourth toe; each  has 31 longitudinal rows of scales around the body.      =Boa constrictor imperator= Daudin          15 km. NW of Chinaja, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 2; Toocog, 1.    All specimens were found on the forest floor. One individual was found  in combat with a large _Drymarchon corais melanurus_. Apparently, the  _Drymarchon_ was attempting to devour the _Boa_, which had a total  length of 1683 mm. Locally this snake is called _masacuata_; it is one  of the few snakes believed by the local inhabitants to be non-poisonous.      =Clelia clelia clelia= Daudin          15 km. NW of Chinaja, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1.    One specimen is represented only by the head; the snake was killed on  the forest floor by workmen. Another individual was found in a pool of  water at the base of a limestone outcropping in the forest; this  specimen (KU 58167) is a female having a body length of 2220 mm. and a  total length of 2634 mm. This snake contained 22 ova averaging 56 x 23  mm. Both specimens were uniform shiny black above and cream-color below.  The local name is _sumbadora_.      =Coniophanes bipunctatus bipunctatus= (Guenther)          Chinaja, 1.    This snake was found on the forest floor by day; it is a male having 130  ventrals, an incomplete tail; cream-colored belly, and a pair of large  brown spots on each ventral scute.      =Coniophanes fissidens fissidens= (Guenther)          Toocog, 1.    This male specimen was found beneath a rock in a sink hole. It has 122  ventrals and 77 caudals. A narrow temporal stripe extends along the  upper edge of the anterior temporal and the lower edge of the upper  secondary temporal. The belly is ashy white with a pair of small black  spots on each ventral.      =Coniophanes imperialis clavatus= (Peters)          Chinaja, 3.    All specimens were found on the forest floor by day. These small snakes  are capable of rapid movement and quickly disappear in the litter on the  ground. Two individuals evaded capture. The belly is creamy white  anteriorly and vermillion red posteriorly.      =Dryadophis melanolomus laevis= (Fischer)          Chinaja, 3.    These snakes, locally known as _sumbadora_, were found on the forest  floor; two others were seen, but escaped. The variation in coloration  has been a source of confusion in this species in northern Central  America (see Stuart, 1941:86). All of the present specimens are males:  KU 55709 has 178 ventrals, 121 caudals, and a total length of 914 mm.;  the dorsum is olive-tan with six darker cross-bars on the neck; the  belly is creamy white. KU 58160 has 188 ventrals, 123 caudals, and a  total length of 1365 mm.; the dorsum is uniform olive-brown, except that  some dorsal scales at midbody have black anterior borders like _D.  melanolomus melanolomus_ has in the Yucatan Peninsula; the venter is  pale yellow. KU 58158 has 179 ventrals, 122 caudals, and a total length  of 723 mm.; the dorsum is rich chocolate brown with eight dark  cross-bars on the neck; the belly is bright orange.    Stuart (1941a:87) stated that in life two distinct color phases were  observed in specimens collected by him in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. One  had an olive-brown dorsum and the other, a reddish orange dorsum.  Stuart made no mention of variation in the color of the venter. Similar  variation is known in _D. melanolomus alternatus_ in Costa Rica, where  some individuals have orange-red venters. This color phase has been  recognized as a distinct species, _Dryadophis sanguiventris_, by Taylor  (1954:722). Examination of 18 specimens from Costa Rica shows no  differences in scutellation, nor geographic segregation of two  populations. I am convinced that the red-bellied _Dryadophis_ in Costa  Rica, like those in Guatemala, represent a color phase of the subspecies  inhabiting those areas and that _Dryadophis sanguiventris_ Taylor is a  synonym of _Dryadophis melanolomus alternatus_ (Bocourt).      =Drymarchon corais melanurus= (Dumeril, Bibron and Dumeril)          15 km. NW of Chinaja, 1; Sayaxche, 1.    The specimen from Sayaxche was found at the edge of a clearing in the  forest; that from 15 kilometers northwest of Chinaja was found on the  forest floor coiled with a _Boa constrictor imperator_, which the  _Drymarchon_ apparently was trying to eat. The _Drymarchon_ is a giant  specimen having a total length of 2950 mm. (see Duellman, 1961:368). The  _Boa_ with which it was coiled has a total length of 1683 mm. I was  attracted to the snakes by a loud thrashing noise. When I approached the  writhing mass, the snakes separated, but I was able to see that the  _Drymarchon_ had its teeth firmly imbedded in the posterior part of the  head of the _Boa_. From the _Drymarchon_ I forced the regurgitation of a  recently ingested _Bothrops nummifer nummifer_ having a total length of  953 mm. These observations show that the snake-eating capabilities of  _Drymarchon_ can hardly be over-estimated.    In both _Drymarchon_ the anterior one-half of the body is olive-tan,  which changes to bluish black posteriorly. The local name is  _sumbadora_.      =Drymobius margaritiferus margaritiferus= (Schlegel)          Chinaja, 3; Sayaxche, 1.    All individuals were obtained in clearings in the forest by day in the  rainy season. Two individuals each contained a _Similisca baudini_ and  another contained a _Bufo valliceps"]]]
