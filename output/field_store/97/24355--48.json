The world's history of silver mining  in the past shows nothing like this for so young a camp. Scarcely a  month passes without opening up some new and vast carbonate deposits.  The territory has not even been thoroughly prospected; and the future  yield of the royal metal will far eclipse its past production.    It might not be uninteresting in this connection to give something  regarding the sampling and milling of ores. One of the most complete  concerns engaged in this business anywhere in the country is that of  Augustus R. Meyer & Co. This establishment has grown with the growth  and development of this carbonate district. The business was first  established as long ago as the year 1877 (before Little Pittsburg was  dreamed of). A little log house, a relic of seventeen years previous,  was found sufficiently ample for the needs of the business of that  period. However, it was not long before additions had to be made  and new buildings erected. In the year 1879 the present company was  incorporated with a capital stock of $50,000, and every preparation  that money and business sagacity could effect was made to meet the  demands of the prosperous era, that has built a mining metropolis  10,240 feet above the sea level, at the base of the great continental  divide. As at present constituted the premises of the company comprise  seven and one-half acres of ground, upon which six buildings have been  erected, including ore houses and crushing and sampling buildings.  During the busy season of summer from thirty-five to forty men are  employed, who alternate their work in two shifts, day and night. At  this season it frequently happens that the ore houses, which hold  1,500 tons, are insufficient for the accommodation of the mineral sent  from the mines to be crushed, and large quantities have to be stored  outside. In sampling ores from the various mines about Leadville this  establishment pursues the most careful methods. The different ores are  first deposited in large bins holding from 25 to 100 tons. One-tenth  of each load is taken and run through a Dodge crusher, which well  adapts it for the furnaces. A fifth of the tenth already indicated is  put through heavy rollers, and one half of this finely crushed ore is  subjected to the Bucking hammer and powdered to an eighty-sieve grade.  One sample of this powder, consisting of a fourth, is given to the  miner, two samples are kept for reference, and the other is sent to  the assayer, who takes his \"assay ton,\" upon which the company buys  and sells. The capacity of the works are all the way from 80 to 150  tons per day. For samples, $7.50 is charged for silver and lead per  ton, and $10 per ton for gold; but in large quantities a less charge  is made. In job crushing, the market value of silver is allowed, with  from five to ten per cent. deducted. The Meyer works enjoy an excellent  patronage from the best mines of the camp, including such as the  Chrysolite, Carbonate, Vulture, Duncan, Matchless, Climax, Morning  Star, Crescent, and J. D. Dana, some of which have all their crushing  done at these sampling works.    [Illustration: AUGUSTUS R. MEYER AND COMPANY'S ORE MILL.]           *       *       *       *       *          RAILROADS.    In order to furnish better transportation facilities for the mineral  of this district, and to emancipate it from the freight embargo  that has virtually fettered its commerce, citizens of Leadville have  determined to construct a broad gauge railway down the Arkansas Valley  to Pueblo. This will enable Leadville merchants to ship goods through  from the East without breaking bulk, and lay them down in their  warehouses as cheaply as the same commodities could be laid down in  Denver. This will insure Leadville the control of the business of  the Gunnison country, whose mineral developments are spoken of in the  highest terms. Propositions from Eastern railroad contractors have  already been received, preliminary surveys have been made, and  $200,000 guaranteed to the stock subscription. It now seems to be only  a question of what method to pursue in constructing the road.    Growing out of the broad gauge movement, to some extent, two or three  narrow gauge enterprises have been organized. One is projected from  Leadville to Salt Lake City, following the carbonate belt, as shown in  Hayden's Geological Map, around through the Eagle River, Roaring Fork,  and White River Agency districts, into Utah. Such men as H. A. W.  Tabor and C. B. Rustin stand at the head of this project. Another  narrow gauge road is organized to be built into the \"Ten-Mile\" and  Breckenridge districts, where the famous Robinson Mine is located.  Should the broad gauge be built this summer to Pueblo, there is little  doubt but that narrow gauges would ramify out from Leadville into  every mineral bearing gulch that was found accessible.    W.    Leadville, May 6, 1880.           *       *       *       *       *          MECHANICAL INVENTIONS.    Mr. William B. Hickman, of Sterling, Kan., has patented a swage to be  used in welding the triangular bar which is to form the flange of a  plow point or share to the body of the same.    Mr. Lucius S. Edleblute, of Cincinnati, O., has recently patented what  he calls the rubber cushioned spoke and hub. This is an improvement  in the class of vehicle wheel hubs having an elastic band or annular  portion which surrounds the journal box and on which the butts of the  spokes rest, so that the wheel is rendered elastic and more durable,  also comparatively noiseless when running on stony pavements, roads,  or streets.    Mr. George Richards, of Boxbury, Mass., has patented a steam muffler  composed of two plates of a diameter very much greater than the  diameter of the pipe through which the steam escapes from the boiler,  so that the steam has room to expand before escaping to the outer air,  its expansion effectually deadening the noise caused by the passage  through the contracted escape pipe.           *       *       *       *       *          THE BABY ELEPHANT TAKES A BATH.    It is customary with traveling menageries in hot weather when  convenient to a river to allow the elephants to take a bath. The  London Circus passed through Woonsocket, R. I., the other day, when  the keeper let loose all the elephants, including \"Hebe\" and her baby,  for the above purpose. The mother and her offspring were permitted to  approach a river for the first time since the baby was born, and they  were, therefore, watched with great interest by their keeper. The  mother cautiously approached the Blackstone River, which flows past  the circus grounds, and waded in a short distance, carefully feeling  her way; she then encouraged the baby to follow her, which the  obedient little fellow did. When far enough in the mother caught the  baby between her fore legs, and then lay down in the water and rolled  over, giving the baby the first bath. The mother then felt perfectly  satisfied with her job, and rising up approached the bank, bringing  the little one with her. On reaching terra firma she drove the younger  before her, and would not allow it to approach the water again, though  it showed a disposition to do so.           *       *       *       *       *          PHYLLIRHOE BUCEPHALA.    This little animal belongs to the family of snails, class Heteropoda,  is about an inch long, and is devoid of any shell or covering  whatever. It is flat, and so absolutely transparent that a person  can read through its body. It is provided with a pair of feelers. The  little animal is very luminous if placed in fresh water or disturbed,  but this phenomenon is most beautiful when an ammonia solution is  poured over the animal. It will shine with a vivid blue light, which  extinguishes with life. But even after death the nerve cells, which  are directly below the skin and produce the light, can be irritated  sufficiently to become luminous. It is a singular fact that  electricity has no effect upon these nerve cells.

In view of the drought which prevails in many parts of the country and  its unusual severity over extensive districts, the _Rural New Yorker_  suggests to those who have planted trees or shrubs the past spring  that there is one method, and so far as we know, says the writer, only  one, by which they may be protected against injury or death from that  cause. Surface watering has been shown to do more harm than good. The  ground is made hard and compact, thus becoming a better conductor of  heat while it becomes less pervious to air and moisture. A portion of  the surface soil should be removed, and then pailful after pailful  of water thrown in until the ground, to a depth of two feet and to  a width about the stem of not less than three feet in diameter, has  become saturated. Then, as soon as the water has disappeared from the  surface, the removed soil should be well pulverized and returned. A  covering of boards, straw, or hay, or even of sand or gravel, may then  be applied, and the tree or shrub, thus treated, will pass through ten  days of additional drought in safety.    As soon as rain comes to wet the earth thoroughly, we think it is  better to remove the mulch. Nothing is then gained by permitting it  to remain. Mellowing the surface soil about the trees, thus keeping it  free from grass and weeds, is then the most that is needed. We would  repeat that the present is the season when the female borer deposits  her eggs on the stems of fruit trees, and the wash of lime, potash,  sulphur, etc. (darkened with lampblack), should now be applied and  reapplied during June and July, as soon as washed off"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38516"],[0,"The Children's Life of the Bee (#8)"],[1," appears to possess two sides to her nature; in  the hive, in their home, they all help and care for each other; the  union between them, the fellowship, is very close and very true. A  thousand bees will sacrifice themselves to avenge an injury done by a  stranger to one of their sisters. But outside the hive, away from the  home, all this changes; they no longer appear to know one another. If a  piece of honeycomb were placed a few steps away from their dwelling, and  out of the crowd of bees that would flock to it you were to crush or  injure twenty or thirty, the others who had not been attacked would not  even turn their head. That strange tongue of theirs, curved like some  Chinese weapon, would quietly go on licking up the fluid that they  regard as more precious than life, and they would pay no heed whatever  to the agony, the cries of distress, of their sisters. And when they  have sucked the comb dry, they will be so anxious that not one drop  shall be lost, that they will even climb over the dead and the dying to  lick up the honey these hold in their jaws, and not one sound and  unharmed bee will make the slightest effort to help or relieve the  victims. The thought that they themselves run any danger does not  disturb them; they give no thought to the death that may perhaps await  them too.    But the fact is that the bees do not know the meaning of fear, and smoke  is the one thing in the world that they are afraid of. When they are out  of the hive, they are curiously inoffensive. They will avoid anything  that comes in their way, they will appear not to notice it, provided  always that it does not venture too near. This indulgence, however, this  meekness, hides a heart that is very sure of itself, very confident,  very reliant. No threat will induce the bee to alter her course; she  will never attempt to escape. Inside the hive, any danger, whatever it  be, will at once be boldly faced. Should any living creature, be it ant  or bear or man, venture to attack the sacred dwelling, every bee will  spring up and defend the home with passionate fury.    But we must frankly admit that they show no fellowship outside the hive,  and no sympathy, as we understand the word, within it. On the other  hand, nowhere in the world shall we discover a more perfect organization  of work for the benefit of all, a more amazing devotion to the coming  generation. It may be, perhaps, that this very devotion may have caused  them to ignore everything else. All their love goes to what lies ahead  of them; we give ours to what is around us. And are we so sure that, in  our own lives, there are not many things that we do that would seem  heartless and cruel to some being who might be watching us as closely as  we watch the bees?      Let us now see what means the bees have of communicating with each  other. Such means must obviously exist, for it would not be possible  for the work of so large a city, work which is so varied and so  perfectly organized, to be carried on without them. They must have some  method of communication, either by sounds or by some language of touch.  This strange sense may perhaps lie in the antennae, which are little  horns, or feelers, containing, in the case of the workers, 12,000  delicate hairs and 5,000 \"smell hollows\"; with these antennae they seem  to question and understand the darkness.    It is evidently not only in their work that the bees are able to  communicate with each other, for we know that any news, good or bad, any  sudden event, will at once be noised about in the hive; the loss or  return of the queen, for instance, the entrance of an enemy, the  intrusion of a strange queen, or the discovery of treasure. And each  separate incident produces such a different emotion among them, the  sounds they make are so essentially varied, that the experienced  bee-keeper, listening to the murmur that arises from the hive, can at  once and without any difficulty tell what it is that disturbs the  multitude that are moving restlessly to and fro in their city.    If you would like to have a more definite proof, you have only to watch  a bee which shall just have found a few drops of honey on your  window-sill or the edge of your table. She will immediately lap it up;  and so eagerly that you will have time to put a tiny touch of paint on  her belt without disturbing or interrupting her. It is not that she is  greedy; she rejoices at the thought that she has found some honey for  the hive. As soon as she has filled her sac, she will go, but watch her  manner of going; she will not, like the fly, for instance, merely buzz  around or make a dart for the window; for a moment or two she will hover  about the room, with her back to the light, eagerly fixing in her mind  the exact position of the honey. Then, and not till then, she will  return to the hive, empty her sac into one of the provision-cells; and  in three or four minutes you will find her back again, going  unhesitatingly to the spot, and making straight for the honey. And so  she will come and go, till evening, if need be, as long as a drop  remains; and her journeys from the hive to the window, from the window  to the hive, will be as regular as clock-work; there will be no interval  for rest; there will be no interruption.      I will frankly admit that the marked bee often returns alone. Are there  the same differences among the bees, perhaps, as among ourselves, some  of them being gossips, and others not given to talk? When I was trying  this experiment once a friend who was with me said that it must be mere  selfishness or vanity on the part of the bee that kept her from letting  her comrades know of the treasure she had found. But, be this as it may,  it will often happen that the lucky bee will bring two or three friends  back with her; and I have found this to be the case four times out of  ten. One day it was a little Italian bee which was the first to find the  honey; I marked her belt with a touch of blue paint. When she had gorged  herself she flew off, and came back with two of her sisters; these I  imprisoned, but did not interfere with her. After her second feast she  went forth once more, and this time returned with three friends, whom I  again shut away, and kept on doing this for the rest of the afternoon,  when, counting my prisoners, I found that she had brought no less than  eighteen bees to the feast.    One may safely say that the bees will very frequently communicate with  each other, even though this is not an invariable rule. American  bee-hunters are so sure of the bees possessing this faculty that their  methods of searching for nests depend in some measure upon it. \"They  will take a box of honey,\" Mr. Josiah Emery writes, \"to a field or a  wood far away from any tame bees, and then pick up two or three wild  ones, and let them fill themselves with the honey. The bees will fly off  to their home with the spoil, and soon return with their friends, to  whom they have told the glad news. These will again be allowed to drink  their fill, and then taken to different points of the compass, and  allowed to fly home; the direction of their flight will be carefully  noted, and in this way the hunters are able to discover the position of  the tree in which the bees have built their nest.\"      It is to be noticed, too, that the bees do not all come together to feed  on the honey we have put on the table; there will be several seconds  between the different arrivals. We ask ourselves therefore whether the  bees are led by, and merely follow the original discoverer, or whether  they go independently, having been told by her where it is? Experts hold  different opinions as to this; in the case of the ant Sir John Lubbock  is satisfied that the ant which finds the treasure merely leads the way  and is followed by the others; but the ant, of course, merely crawls  along the ground, while the bee's wings throw every avenue open.    My study in the country is on the first floor, and rather above the  ordinary range of the flight of the bees, except at times when the lime  and chestnut trees are in blossom. I took an open honeycomb, and kept it  on my table for a week, without its perfume having attracted a single  bee. Then I went to a glass hive that was close by the house, took an  Italian bee, brought her in to my study, set her on the comb, and marked  while she was feeding. When she had drunk her fill, she flew off and  returned to the hive. I followed quickly, saw her crawl over the huddled  mass of the bees, plunge her head into an empty cell, disgorge her  honey, and then get ready to set forth again. At the entrance of the  hive I had placed a glass box, divided by a trap-door into two  compartments. The bee flew into this box; and as she was alone, and no  other bee seemed to accompany or follow her, I left her there, and then  repeated the experiment on twenty bees in succession. By means of the  trap, with its two little compartments, I was able in each case to  separate the marked bee from the ones that might accompany her, and to  keep her a prisoner in one of the little rooms. Then I marked all the  bees in the other room with paint of a different color, and set them  free; I myself returned quickly to my study, to await their arrival.    Now if the bees which had not visited my study had been able to  communicate with the others, and to be told by them precisely where the  comb was, with instructions how to get at it, a certain number of them  would have found their way to my room. I must frankly admit that, to my  disappointment, there was only one that did actually arrive. And I  cannot tell even whether this may not have been a mere chance. I went  down and released the first bee, and my study soon was invaded by the  buzzing crowd to whom she showed the way to the treasure.    We need not trouble any further with this unsatisfactory experiment of  mine, for there are many other curious"]]]
