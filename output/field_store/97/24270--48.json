His famous  proposal for a new version of the Bible, however, which Matthew Arnold  solemnly held up to reprobation, was only a joke which Matthew Arnold  did not see-the new version of Job being, in fact, a clever bit  of political satire against party leadership in England. Even more  brilliant examples of his skill in political satire are his imaginary  \"Edict of the King of Prussia against England,\" and his famous \"Rules  for Reducing a Great Empire to a Small One. \"But I must not try to call  the roll of all the good things in Franklin's ten volumes. I will simply  say that those who know Franklin only in his \"Autobiography,\" charming  as that classic production is, have made but an imperfect acquaintance  with the range, the vitality, the vigor of this admirable craftsman  who chose a style \"smooth, clear, and short,\" and made it serve every  purpose of his versatile and beneficent mind.    When the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765 startled the American colonies  out of their provincial sense of security and made them aware of their  real attitude toward the mother country, Franklin was in London. Eleven  years earlier, in 1754, he had offered a plan for the \"Union of the  Colonies,\" but this had not contemplated separation from England. It was  rather what we should call a scheme for imperial federation under the  British Crown. We may use his word union, however, in a different field  from that of politics. How much union of sentiment, of mental and moral  life, of literary, educational, and scientific endeavor, was there in  the colonies when the hour of self-examination came? Only the briefest  summary may be attempted here. As to race, these men of the third and  fourth generation since the planting of the colonies were by no means  so purely English as the first settlers. The 1,600,000 colonists in  1760 were mingled of many stocks, the largest non-English elements being  German and Scotch-Irish--that is, Scotch who had settled for a while in  Ulster before emigrating to America. \"About one-third of the colonists  in 1760,\" says Professor Channing, \"were born outside of America.\"  Crevecoeur's \"Letters from an American Farmer\" thus defined the  Americans: \"They are a mixture of English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch,  Germans, and Swedes. From this promiscuous breed that race now called  Americans has arisen.\" The Atlantic seaboard, with a narrow strip  inland, was fairly well covered by local communities, differing in  blood, in religion, in political organization--a congeries of separate  experiments or young utopias, waiting for that most utopian experiment  of all, a federal union. But the dominant language of the \"promiscuous  breed\" was English, and in the few real centers of intellectual life the  English tradition was almost absolute.    The merest glance at colonial journalism will confirm this estimate. The  \"Boston News-Letter,\" begun in 1704, was the first of the journals, if  we omit the single issue of \"Publick Occurrences\" in the same town in  1690. By 1765 there were nearly fifty colonial newspapers and several  magazines. Their influence made for union, in Franklin's sense of that  word, and their literary models, like their paper, type, and even ink,  were found in London. The \"New England Courant,\" established in Boston  in 1721 by James Franklin, is full of imitations of the \"Tatler,\"  \"Spectator,\" and \"Guardian.\" What is more, the \"Courant\" boasted of  its office collection of books, including Shakespeare, Milton, the  \"Spectator,\" and Swift's \"Tale of a Tub.\" * This was in 1722. If we  remember that no allusion to Shakespeare has been discovered in the  colonial literature of the seventeenth century, and scarcely an allusion  to the Puritan poet Milton, and that the Harvard College Library in 1723  had nothing of Addison, Steele, Bolingbroke, Dryden, Pope, and Swift,  and had only recently obtained copies of Milton and Shakespeare, we  can appreciate the value of James Franklin's apprenticeship in London.  Perhaps we can even forgive him for that attack upon the Mathers which  threw the conduct of the \"Courant,\" for a brief period, into the hands  of his brother Benjamin, whose turn at a London apprenticeship was soon  to come.         * Cook, E. C. \"Literary Influences in Colonial Newspapers,       1704-1750.\" N. Y., 1912.    If we follow this younger brother to Philadelphia and to Bradford's  \"American Mercury\" or to Franklin's own \"Pennsylvania Gazette,\" or if  we study the \"Gazettes\" of Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, the  impression is still the same. The literary news is still chiefly from  London, from two months to a year late. London books are imported  and reprinted. Franklin reprints Pamela, and his Library Company of  Philadelphia has two copies of \"Paradise Lost\" for circulation in 1741,  whereas there had been no copy of that work in the great library of  Cotton Mather. American journalism then, as now, owed its vitality to a  secular spirit of curiosity about the actual world. It followed England  as its model, but it was beginning to develop a temper of its own.    Colonial education and colonial science were likewise chiefly indebted  to London, but by 1751 Franklin's papers on electricity began to repay  the loan. A university club in New York in 1745 could have had but  fifteen members at most, for these were all the \"academics\" in town.  Yet Harvard had then been sending forth her graduates for more than a  century. William and Mary was founded in 1693, Yale in 1701, Princeton  in 1746, King's (now Columbia) in 1754, the University of Pennsylvania  in 1755, and Brown in 1764. These colonial colleges were mainly in the  hands of clergymen. They tended to reproduce a type of scholarship based  upon the ancient languages. The curriculum varied but little in the  different colonies, and this fact helped to produce a feeling of  fellowship among all members of the republic of letters. The men who  debated the Stamp Act were, with a few striking exceptions, men trained  in Latin and Greek, familiar with the great outlines of human history,  accustomed to the discipline of academic disputation. They knew the  ideas and the vocabulary of cultivated Europe and were conscious of no  provincial inferiority. In the study of the physical sciences, likewise,  the colonials were but little behind the mother country. The Royal  Society had its distinguished members here. The Mathers, the Dudleys,  John Winthrop of Connecticut, John Bartram, James Logan, James Godfrey,  Cadwallader Colden, and above all, Franklin himself, were winning the  respect of European students, and were teaching Americans to use their  eyes and their minds not merely upon the records of the past but in  searching out the inexhaustible meanings of the present. There is no  more fascinating story than that of the beginnings of American science  in and outside of the colleges, and this movement, like the influence of  journalism and of the higher education, counted for colonial union.    Professor Tyler, our foremost literary student of the period, summarizes  the characteristics of colonial literature in these words: \"Before the  year 1765, we find in this country, not one American people, but many  American peoples.... No cohesive principle prevailed, no centralizing  life; each little nation was working out its own destiny in its own  fashion.\" But he adds that with that year the colonial isolation came to  an end, and that the student must thereafter \"deal with the literature  of one multitudinous people, variegated, indeed, in personal traits,  but single in its commanding ideas and in its national destinies.\" It is  easy to be wise after the event. Yet there was living in London in 1765,  as the agent for Pennsylvania, a shrewd and bland Colonial--an honorary  M. A. from both Harvard and Yale, a D.C.L. of Oxford and an LL.D. of  St. Andrews who was by no means sure that the Stamp Act meant the end of  Colonialism. And Franklin's uncertainty was shared by Washington. When  the tall Virginian took command of the Continental Army as late as 1775,  he \"abhorred the idea of independence.\" Nevertheless John Jay, writing  the second number of the \"Federalist\" in 1787, only twelve years later,  could say: \"Providence has been pleased to give this one connected  country to one united people; a people descended from the same  ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion,  attached to the same principles of government.\"        CHAPTER IV. THE REVOLUTION    If we turn, however, to the literature produced in America between the  passage of the Stamp Act in 1765 and the adoption of the Constitution  in 1787, we perceive that it is a literature of discord and passion.  Its spirit is not that of \"one united people.\" Washington could indeed  declare in his \"Farewell Address\" of 1796, \"With slight shades of  difference, you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political  principles\"; yet no one knew better than Washington upon what a slender  thread this political unity had often hung, and how impossible it had  been to foresee the end from the beginning.    It is idle to look in the writings of the Revolutionary period for the  literature of beauty, for a quiet harmonious unfolding of the deeper  secrets of life. It was a time of swift and pitiless change, of action  rather than reflection, of the turning of many separate currents  into one headlong stream. \"We must, indeed, all hang together,\"  runs Franklin's well-known witticism in Independence Hall, \"or, most  assuredly, we shall all hang separately.\" Excellently spoken, Doctor!  And that homely, cheery, daring sentence gives the keynote of much of  the Revolutionary writing that has survived.

[Illustration: TRIP TRIGGER FALL.]    The pens or enclosures used cannot be covered, as this would  interfere with the workings of the triggers. If the pen is sixteen  inches or higher very few animals will climb over to get bait, but  will go in where the trapper wants and if properly made and set are  apt to catch the game.      * * *    Along in the late seventies or beginning of the eighties, when a good  sized muskrat would bring about as much as a common prime mink, and a  steel trap was quite a prize to be in possession of, I had perhaps  two dozen traps, some old fashioned, that would be quite a curiosity  at present, besides a few Newhouse No. 0 and 1.    That was in Ontario, Canada. Skunk, mink, coon, muskrat and fox were  the furs in that part, Waterloo, Brant and Oxford Counties. Later I  used this deadfall with success in Iowa and other sections, so that  there is no doubt but that it will be found a good fur catcher in  most localities.    I used to catch a great deal with deadfalls,--picture of which I here  enclose. I have seen nearly all the different makes of deadfalls and  have tried some of them, but the one I here send you the picture of,  which can be easily understood, is the one I have had the most  success with. I believe they are the best, and an animal can't get at  the bait without striking it off, besides some animals will examine a  bait without touching it. This deadfall, if they are curious enough  just to enter inside and put their foot on the trigger stick, they  are yours if the trap is set properly.      [Illustration: CANADIAN TRIP FALL.]    This style of deadfall can be successfully, used over skunk holes,  game runways and there you do away with the bait yard. This style of  trap is much easier made, as it requires very little skill. Just a  few straight sticks about the size round of a cane, a little twine.  You can catch most any animal from a weasel to a raccoon. The  illustration shows the \"fall\" or upper pole weighted. In our  experience we have found it more satisfactory to have the \"fall\"  heavy enough to kill the animal without the weight. It is often hard  for the trapper to find a pole of the right size and weight for the  \"fall\" and the next best way is to place additional weight as shown.      * * *    First make a pen in the form of a wigwam, driving stakes well into  the ground to keep the animal away from the rear of the trap. It  should be open on one side. Place a short log in front of the opening  and at both ends of this drive stakes to hold it in place and for the  long log to work up and down in. The top log should be six or eight  feet long, according to size of animal you aim to use trap for, and  about the same size as the bottom log. Cut a forked stick about 12  inches long for the bait stick, notching one end and tapering the  other as shown in Fig. No. 2. A stick 24 inches long should then be  cut and flattened at both ends.      [Illustration: THE TURN TRIGGER.]    To set the trap, raise one end of the upper log and stick one end of  the flattened stick under it, resting it upon the top of the stake on  the outside of the log. Place the bait stick, point downward, inside  the pen upon a chip of wood or rock to keep it from sinking into the  ground and set flat stick in the notch. When the animal pulls at the  bait it turns the bait stake and throws the cross piece out of the  notch of the bait stick and let the top log fall.        CHAPTER X.    HOW TO SET.    In explaining size pen some make them 2 feet long, writes a New York  trapper, while one 12 inches long (as used on this trail), is  sufficient; not only that, but it is superior for the following  reasons: A 2 foot pen would let the animal pass inside and beyond the  drop when sprung, unless the animal stepped on the treddle.    The Indians' trap is made by cutting a sapling 3 or 4 inches in  diameter off the butt end cut a piece 2 foot and place on the ground  for a bed piece; drive four stakes, two on either side of bed piece,  leaving a space between of 12 inches, using the balance of pole for  the drop to play between the stakes. For balance of pen a few stakes,  bark or slabs cut from a tree.    For a spindle, cut from a hemlock, spruce or other dry limb a piece  eight or ten inches long, sharpen one end to a point, the other end  flatten a trifle for an inch or two on the underside, so that when  placed on the bed piece it will lay steady. Now with a sharp knife,  commence 1/2 inch back, and round off top side of spindle on which to  place a standard four inches in length, cut from same material as  spindle.    In setting, place the bait on the spindle so as to leave a space of  only six inches from bait to the standard; now take spindle in left  hand, standard in right hand, kneel down, raise the drop placing one  knee under it to hold it up the right height. Lay spindle onto center  of bed piece and place the standard on top of spindle, letting drop  rest on top of standard so as to keep the pieces in position. Now by  moving the standard out or in on the spindle, the spring of the trap  can be so gauged that it will set safely for weeks or months, sprung  easily, and hold anything from a weasel to a raccoon.    It is sure, as it kills immediately, giving them no chance to escape  by twisting or gnawing off their legs. It is not so quickly made and  set as a steel trap, and never gives \"Sneakums\" inducements to  approach it for future use. After the trap is set, place bark or  something suitable between the stakes above the drop and cover top of  pen so as to compel the animal to enter in front, and at the same  time ward off snow and sleet from interfering with its workings.  Weight the drop pole on either side of pen by placing on chunks of  wood or stone.      * * *    There are several ways to set deadfalls, as different triggers are  used. The manner in constructing these traps is varied somewhat in  the different sections. The illustration shown here is of a trap that  is used to a considerable extent in all parts of America. The trapper  for marten in the far North, the opossum trapper of West Virginia,  Kentucky and Missouri, the skunk trapper of the New England States  and the mink trapper of the west have all used this trap with  success. It is for the hundreds of young and inexperienced trappers  that the deadfall is shown here.      [Illustration: TWO PIECE TRIGGER TRAP.]    The trigger as shown, that is the one extending back into the pen, is  all one piece. This trigger is usually cut from a bush and often  requires some time to find one suited. If you intend to build a few  traps of this kind it is well to be on the lookout in advance for  suitable triggers. This trap is set with only two triggers, the one  with the straight part extending back into the pen and the prong on  which the \"fall\" is resting and the other trigger is driven into the  ground so that it is only a little higher than the under log of the  trap.    This trap can be set with the triggers known as figure 4 if  preferred. Coon, mink, opossum, skunk and marten are usually not hard  to catch in deadfalls, although now and then an animal for some  reason is extremely hard to catch.    In building deadfalls it is best to split the end of the pole  fartherest from the pen or bait and drive the stake there. This will  hold the upper or \"fall\" pole solid, so that there will be no danger  of its turning of its own weight and falling.      * * *    I enclose plan and description of a deadfall I have used with success  on skunk and other fur animals, writes a trapper from New York State.  Never having seen anything like it described I thought it might be a  help to those using these traps. During November and December, 1897,  I caught 11 skunk in one deadfall like this one.      [Illustration: STRING AND TRIGGER TRAP.]    Stakes are driven in the ground to form the pen same as on figure 4  or other deadfall, but no brush or sticks should be laid on top of  pen as it would prevent the vertical stick from lifting up, A small  log or board with stones on may be laid on pole for more weight. The  pole may be from ten to fifteen feet long and about three inches in  diameter. AA 18 inches or more out of the ground and one-half inch in  diameter; B 20 inches, X one-half inch; C about 16 X 3/4 inches; D 20  X 3/4 inches; E same as AA only not crotch; F 1/4 inch. Rope long  enough to go around pole and over B and tie around C. D should be  from 1 to 3 inches above ground according to what is being trapped.  Bait should be laid on ground or fastened to stake near middle of  pen.        CHAPTER XI.    WHEN TO BUILD.    If you have determined upon your trapping ground it is best to build  your traps in advance of the trapping season, so that they will  become old and weather beaten. This, of course, is not necessary as  traps are often built, baited and on the return of the trapper the  following morning game securely caught. While the above is often  true, deadfalls can and should be built in advance of the trapping  season. There are at least two reasons for this: first, it allows the  traps to become weather beaten and game is not so suspicious; second,  all the trapper has to do when the trapping season arrives is to  visit and set his traps.    Some object to deadfalls on the ground that they require lots of work  to build and that a trapper's time is valuable at this season of the  year. Such may be true of the amateur, but the professional trapper  usually has much idle time in August, September and early October,  when he is glad to look out for trapping grounds for the coming  winter. It is a day's work for one man to build from eight to twelve  deadfalls, depending of course upon how convenient he finds the pole  to make the fall. The other material is usually not hard to find or  make. That is stakes, chunks and rocks. If you only build six or  eight traps and construct them right they are worth"]]]
