Mormon communication with the American Indians for the purpose of  despoiling the Gentiles and taking possession of their lands can never  be set down as one of the causes of the Missouri persecution; for such  communication never took place--the charge of it was untrue. It was,  however, one of a number of pretexts, and became a factor in creating  public prejudice, which alone made possible the expulsion of the Saints  from Missouri.    _The Unwisdom of the Saints_.    I come now to one of the most delicate subdivisions of this {XXXIII}  Introduction; namely, the unwisdom of the Saints. To appreciate this  as a factor in the Missouri persecutions one needs to take into  account not only human nature, but also human nature under the stress  of religious impulse and influence. First, however, as to the facts  involved.    To the Saints of those times had been given a dispensation of the  Gospel--a new revelation of it. They had been blessed with the spirit  of faith to receive it. To them it was made known that God had again  spoken from heaven; He had again conferred divine authority upon men  to act in His name--many of the brethren, the majority of the male  membership of the Church in fact, held that divine authority, the  priesthood of God; the terms of man's salvation were restated; the  spiritual powers and gifts of the Gospel were guaranteed anew and  plenteously enjoyed by the Saints. To them was made known the truth of  a new volume of scripture, the Book of Mormon. The knowledge imparted  by that book was in itself, and especially to them, wonderful. From it  they learned that the ancient inhabitants of the American continents,  the ruins of whose civilization challenged the curiosity of men and  excited their wonder, were of the house of Israel; the American Indians  were their fallen descendants and, of course, also of the house of  Israel and heirs to the general promises made to that people, to say  nothing of special promises made to them as direct descendants of the  house of the patriarch Joseph, son of Jacob. Messiah in his resurrected  and glorified state had visited America and its inhabitants shortly  after His resurrection at Jerusalem, and established the Christian  institution,--a Christian ministry, and a Christian Church, followed  by a veritable golden age of peace, prosperity, and righteousness; and  although the descendants of that ancient God-favored people were now  fallen from the high estate of their fathers, yet were the promises and  prophecies great concerning them. God would again visit them by His  grace, they should be redeemed from their ignorance and barbarism, and  they should yet be important factors in establishing a \"New Jerusalem,\"  the Zion of God on this land of America, given to the descendants of  the ancient patriarch Joseph, whose descendants principally the Indians  are. The Saints had been even so far favored as to have the place for  the chief city of refuge and safety pointed out to them by revelation;  as also the site of its temple--Independence, Missouri; and they were  required by the commandments of God to bear witness to the world of  these things. In view of all this--the fact that they were made at  once the depository and witnesses of these great revelations, is it  not likely that they would regard themselves as a people peculiarly  favored of God? And is it matter of astonishment if some among them,  not possessed of the soundest judgment, should run into an excess of  zeal and give expression to unwise, as also to unwarranted conclusions?    {XXXIV} Moreover, the Lord had spoken of the future glory of Zion--of  the city, the location of which the Elders were to testify; also of the  glory of the temple, with its future cloud by day and pillar of fire by  night; of the future union of this New-World Zion with the ancient Zion  of Enoch, where the Lord will make His abode, \"and for the space of a  thousand years shall the earth rest;\" [11] also of his covenant with  them concerning Zion, both as pertaining to time and eternity, wherein  He said: \"I have made the earth rich; and behold it is my footstool,  wherefore, again I will stand upon it; and I hold forth, and deign to  give unto you greater riches, even a land of promise, a land flowing  with milk and honey, upon which there shall be no curse when the Lord  cometh: and I will give it unto you for the land of your inheritance,  if you seek it with all your hearts. And this shall be my covenant with  you, you shall have it for the land of your inheritance, and for the  inheritance of your children forever, while the earth shall stand, and  you shall possess it again in eternity, no more to pass away.\" [12]    The Lord said again concerning Zion: \"Wherefore I, the Lord, have said,  gather ye out from the eastern lands, assemble yourselves together ye  elders of my Church; go ye forth into the western countries, call upon  the inhabitants to repent, and inasmuch as they do repent, build up  churches unto me; and with one heart and with one mind, gather up your  riches that ye may purchase an inheritance which shall hereafter be  appointed unto you, and it shall be called the New Jerusalem, a land of  peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety for the Saints of the Most  High God; and the glory of the Lord shall be there, insomuch that the  wicked will not come unto it, and it shall be called Zion. And it shall  come to pass, among the wicked, that every man that will not take his  sword against his neighbor, must needs flee unto Zion for safety. And  there shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under heaven; and  it shall be the only people that shall not be at war one with another.  And it shall be said among the wicked, Let us not go up to battle  against Zion, for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible; wherefore we  cannot stand.\" [13]    These promises to the Saints respecting Zion; these descriptions given  to them of her future sanctified and glorified state; their connection  with a work so exalted and far-reaching, was apt to fire their minds  with a zeal not always tempered with wisdom. It was in vain that  limitations of time and conditions were placed upon these general  descriptions of the future greatness and glory of the city of God; nor  could they understand that their own relationship to these great things  {XXXV} was merely to lay the foundation of them, to locate the site of  the future city and temple, and then bear witness of it to the world.  Yet that their work in connection with the founding of Zion was chiefly  this, is clearly to be seen in the revelations of God to them.    The immediate and triumphant establishment of Zion, though expected by  many of the Saints, was nowhere contemplated in the revelations of God  to the Church. That hope of immediate establishment and glorification  of Zion was the result of faulty deductions from the revelations of  God; but the Lord was not blind respecting the events about to take  place on the land of Zion, nor did He hold out any false hope to His  people had they but read His revelations aright. A few days before the  first conference held by the Elders on the land of Zion, the Lord said  to them through His Prophet:    \"Hearken, O ye elders of my Church, and give ear to my word, and learn  of me what I will concerning you, and also concerning this land unto  which I have sent you: For verily I say unto you, blessed is he that  keepeth my commandments, whether in life or in death; and he that is  faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the  kingdom of heaven. Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the  present time, the design of your God concerning those things which  shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow _after much  tribulation. For after much tribulation comes the blessings_. Wherefore  the day Cometh that ye shall be crowned with much glory; the hour is  not yet, but is nigh at hand. Remember this, which I tell you before,  that you may lay it to heart, and receive that which shall follow.  Behold, verily I say unto you, for this cause I have sent you that  you might be obedient, and that your hearts might be prepared to bear  testimony of the things which are to come; and also that you might be  honored of laying the foundation, and of bearing record of the land  upon which the Zion of God shall stand; * * * * and that the testimony  might go forth from Zion, yea, from the mouth of the city of the  heritage of God. * * * * And now, verily, I say, concerning the residue  of the elders of my Church, _the time has not yet come, for many  years_, for them to receive their inheritance in this land, except they  desire it through the prayer of faith, only as it shall be appointed  unto them of the Lord. For, behold, they shall push the people together  from the ends of the earth.\" [14]    These statements, when rightly considered, dispel all notion of  the immediate establishment of Zion. The Lord distinctly warns His  servants against any such supposition. He predicts \"tribulation\" before  the glory shall come. It is only after \"much tribulation\" that the  blessings are {XXXVI} promised. He reminds them that He has \"told them  before\" of this, and asks them \"to lay it to heart,\" and gives them to  understand that it will be \"_many years_\" before some of the Elders of  His Church will receive their inheritance in the goodly land.    The Lord still further foreshadowed the trouble which afterwards  overtook His people by urging them to make arrangements for the  purchase of the whole region that had been designated as the center  place of Zion. \"For, behold, verily I say unto you, the Lord willeth  that the disciples, and the children of men should open their hearts,  even to purchase this whole region of country, as soon as time will  permit. Behold, here is wisdom. Let them do this lest they receive none  inheritance, save it be by the shedding"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47708"],[0,"Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (#8)"],[1,"think, in Stark County, Ohio.  As we approached the house, we saw the landlord standing upon the  porch. Accosting him, I told him we were Mormon preachers, traveling  as the Elders in former times, and asked him if he would be so kind as  to accommodate us with supper and a night's lodging. He very gruffly  refused, saying he kept travelers for their money--not for Gospel pay;  and advised us to go home, get employment, earn money, then give him a  call, and he would be happy to entertain us. I replied that inasmuch as  he had met our request with a decided refusal, we would bid him a good  evening. But as I was turning to go, it forcibly occurred to me to say  something further. Therefore, I said to him, My friend, it is not  our wish to crowd ourselves upon you, but we think it might be well for  you to know the fact that two servants of God have called upon you for  a supper and night's lodging, which you have thought proper to refuse.  The future results of what you have done you do not _now_ know; but we  know, and a time will come when you also will know. When that Scripture  is fulfilled which says, \"When the Son of Man shall come in His glory,  and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of  His glory: and before Him shall be gathered all nations: and He shall  separate them as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.\" \"Then  shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come, ye blessed of my  Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of  the world, for I was hungry, and ye fed me; I was thirsty, and ye gave  me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed  me.\" \"Then shall the righteous say, Lord, when saw we Thee hungry and  fed Thee? Or when saw we Thee a stranger and took Thee in? Then shall  the King say to them, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the  least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" When this event  takes place, you will be there with us, and you will then know that we  were the servants of God, commissioned to preach His Gospel, and when  engaged in this work, we asked you to administer to our necessities,  and you turned us away. This is all I wished to say: we will now go.  Good night.    The gentleman seemed struck with amazement, and at a loss what to say  or do. We had not proceeded far, however, before our ears were saluted  with \"Stop, gentlemen, hold on--you need not go off _mad_--your talk is  all stuff and nonsense: but you have plenty of money, I'll be bound.  Turn back, gentlemen, walk in--walk in.\" Of course, we turned back  and walked in, and were invited to sit down to a good supper, after  which the neighbors were called in, who, with the landlord and family,  listened attentively and with apparent interest to our preaching.  We had excellent lodging and a good breakfast in the morning, and left  without a question whether we had money or not.    The journal continues: I had a strong desire to make known the way  of life as God had revealed in plainness, to my relatives, friends  and associates. For that purpose I visited my native town and had  the privilege of preaching in the school houses, and was offered the  town house, in which I met a large audience, and had the pleasure  of addressing many of my school fellows and the neighbors of my  parents, among whom I had been associated from childhood. How  muchsoever I craved the privilege, and hailed with gratitude to God  this opportunity, it was a trying position. I was well aware that the  principles of the everlasting Gospel, which I estimated dearer than my  mortal life, were in contrast to the creeds of the day, to which many  of my friends adhered with unyielding tenacity. I was listened to with  respectful attention, and although many of my audience acknowledged  their belief in my sincerity; with few exceptions, my testimony was  unheeded. I had the satisfaction, however, of baptizing some of my  schoolmates, who bore testimony that they received a knowledge of the  truth of the work by revelation, through the reception of the Holy  Ghost.    I addressed a large congregation in the meeting house, in the town of  Aurora, adjoining my native town; also in Auburn, Geauga County, in a  school house, mostly filled by my relatives--my grandfather, uncles,  aunts, and cousins.    While on this mission, I traveled in various parts of the State of  Ohio, and during the time baptized many persons who have remained  faithful to the truth. The Lord was with me, and I was greatly blessed  in performing my arduous labors.        Chapter IV.    A change.--Great Apostacy.--Disaffection creeps into every  Quorum.--Pride and speculation.--Apostates claim the Temple.--Warren  Parrish a ringleader.--A fearful, terrible scene in the Temple.--The  scene described.--What occurred the next Day.--Very interesting  Court scene.--John Boynton portrayed.--Joseph and Sidney flee for  their lives.--Father Smith served with State's Warrant.--How he  escaped.--Luke Johnson befriends him.--Luke's death.    During the time my brother was on this, his first mission, a great  change had been going on in Kirtland, in the midst of the Saints. A  spirit of speculation had crept into the hearts of some of the Twelve,  and nearly, if not every quorum was more or less infected. Most of  the Saints were poor, and now prosperity was dawning upon them--the  Temple was completed, and in it they had been recipients of marvelous  blessings, and many who had been humble and faithful to the performance  of every duty--ready to go and come at every call of the Priesthood,  were getting haughty in their spirits, and lifted up in the pride of  their hearts. As the Saints drank in the love and spirit of the world,  the Spirit of the Lord withdrew from their hearts, and they were filled  with pride and hatred toward those who maintained their integrity. They  linked themselves together in an opposing party--pretended that they  constituted the Church, and claimed that the Temple belonged to them,  and even attempted to hold it.    Warren Parrish, who had been a humble, successful preacher of the  Gospel, was the ringleader of this apostate party. One Sabbath morning,  he, with several of his party, came into the Temple armed with pistols  and bowie-knives, and seated themselves together in the Aaronic  pulpits, on the east end of the Temple, while Father Smith and  others, as usual, occupied those of the Melchisedec Priesthood on the  west. Soon after the usual opening services, one of the brethren on  the west stand arose, and just after he commenced to speak, one on the  east interrupted him. Father Smith, presiding, called to order--he told  the apostate brother that he should have all the time he wanted, but  he must wait his turn--as the brother on the west took the floor and  commenced first to speak, he must not be interrupted. A fearful scene  ensued--the apostate speaker becoming so clamorous, that Father Smith  called for the police to take that man out of the house, when Parrish,  John Boynton, and others, drew their pistols and bowie-knives, and  rushed down from the stand into the congregation; J. Boynton saying  he would blow out the brains of the first man who dared to lay hands  on him. Many in the congregation, especially women and children,  were terribly frightened--some tried to escape from the confusion by  jumping out of the windows. Amid screams and shrieks, the policemen,  in ejecting the belligerents, knocked down a stovepipe, which fell  helter-skelter among the people; but, although bowie-knives and pistols  were wrested from their owners, and thrown hither and thither to  prevent disastrous results, no one was hurt, and after a short, but  terrible scene to be enacted in a Temple of God, order was restored,  and the services of the day proceeded as usual.    But the next day Father Smith, and sixteen others, were arrested on  complaint of the apostate party, charged with riot, and bound over for  their appearance in court to answer to the charge. With others, I was  subpoenaed as a witness, and I found the court scene as amusing as the  Temple scene was appalling. The idea of such a man as Father Smith--so  patriarchal in appearance--so circumspect in deportment and dignified  in his manners, being guilty of riot, was at once ludicrous and  farcical to all sane-minded persons. And after the four Gentile  lawyers (two for each party) had expended their stock of wit, the court  dismissed the case with \"no cause for action,\" and Father Smith and his  associates came off triumphant.    During the proceedings, it was very interesting to hear the lawyers  for the defence describe the opposite traits of character exhibited  in the lives and appearances of the men who had apostatized from what  they were when faithful in the work of God. One of them, Mr. Bissell,  of Painesville, Ohio, pointing to John Boynton, said: \"Just look at  Mr. Boynton, see how changed! Before he apostatized, we used to see  him in Painesville--he then was humble, and seemed truly a follower of  the meek and lowly Jesus; but how does he seem now? all puffed up with  pride. He looks more like a celestial dandy than a Saint.\"    Five of the quorum of the Twelve were in this apostacy; and some in  every organized quorum became disaffected. Wherever the spirit of  speculation--a grasping for the things of the world--obtained, the  light of the Spirit of God departed, and impenetrable darkness ensued.  Some even became so blind as to seek to depose the Prophet of God. At  length the hostility of the belligerent party assumed such threatening  attitude that, late in the autumn of 1837, Joseph Smith and Sidney  Rigdon had to flee for their lives; and at a moment's warning, started  for Missouri. But their absence did not check the persecution waged by  those apostate brethren--others became the targets of their malice.  Through their influence, the aged Father Smith was served with "]]]
