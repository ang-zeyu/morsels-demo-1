(Frisch:  VIII, 964.) The third he enunciated in his _Harmonia Mundi_, 1619.  (Ibid: VIII, 1013-1017.)]    From Kepler's student days under Maestlin when as the subject of his  disputation he upheld the Copernican theory, to his death in 1630, he  was a staunch supporter of the new teaching.[169] In his _Epitome  Astronomiae Copernicanae_ (1616) he answered objections to it at  length.[170] He took infinite pains to convert his friends to the new  system. It was in vain that Tycho on his deathbed had urged Kepler to  carry on their work not on the Copernican but on the Tychonic  scheme.[171]    [Footnote 169: \"Cor et animam meam\": Kepler's expression in regard to  the Copernician theory. Ibid: VIII, 957.]    [Footnote 170: Ibid: VIII, 838.]    [Footnote 171: Ibid: VIII, 742.]    Kepler had reasoned out according to physics the laws by which the  planets moved.[172] In Italy at this same time Galileo with his optic  tube (invented 1609) was demonstrating that Venus had phases even as  Copernicus had declared, that Jupiter had satellites, and that the  moon was scarred and roughened--ocular proof that the old system with  its heavenly perfection in number (7 planets) and in appearance must  be cast aside. Within a year after Galileo's death Newton was  born[173] (January 4, 1643). His demonstration of the universal  application of the law of gravitation (1687) was perhaps the climax in  the development of the Copernican system. Complete and final proof  was adding in the succeeding years by Roemer's (1644-1710) discovery  of the velocity of light, by Bradley's (1693-1762) study of its  aberration,[174] by Bessel's discovery of stellar parallax in  1838,[175] and by Foucault's experimental demonstration of the earth's  axial motion with a pendulum in 1851.[176]    [Footnote 172: Kepler: _Op. Om._, I, 106: _Praefatio ad Lectorem_.]    [Footnote 173: Berry: 210.]    [Footnote 174: Berry: 265.]    [Footnote 175: Ibid: 359.]    [Footnote 176: Jacoby: 89.]          PART TWO    THE RECEPTION OF THE COPERNICAN THEORY.          CHAPTER I.    OPINIONS AND ARGUMENTS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.      During the lifetime of Copernicus, Roman Catholic churchmen had been  interested in his work: Cardinal Schoenberg wrote for full information,  Widmanstadt reported on it to Pope Clement VII and Copernicus had  dedicated his book to Pope Paul III.[177] But after his death, the  Church authorities apparently paid little heed to his theory until  some fifty years later when Giordano Bruno forced it upon their  attention in his philosophical teachings. Osiander's preface had  probably blinded their eyes to its implications.    [Footnote 177: See before, p. 30.]    The Protestant leaders were not quite so urbane in their attitude.  While Copernicus was still alive, Luther is reported[178] to have  referred to this \"new astrologer\" who sought to prove that the earth  and not the firmament swung around, saying: \"The fool will overturn  the whole science of astronomy. But as the Holy Scriptures state,  Joshua bade the sun stand still and not the earth.\" Melancthon was  more interested in this new idea, perhaps because of the influence of  Rheticus, his colleague in the University of Wittenberg and  Copernicus's great friend and supporter; but he too preferred not to  dissent from the accepted opinion of the ages.[179] Informally in a  letter to a friend he implies the absurdity of the new teaching,[180]  and in his _Initia Doctrinae Physicae_ he goes to some pains to disprove  the new assumption not merely by mathematics but by the Bible, though  with a kind of apology to other physicists for quoting the Divine  Witness.[181] He refers to the phrase in Psalm XIX likening the sun in  its course \"to a strong man about to run a race,\" proving that the sun  moves. Another Psalm states that the earth was founded not to be moved  for eternity, and a similar phrase occurs in the first chapter of  Ecclesiastes. Then there was the miracle when Joshua bade the sun  stand still. While this is a sufficient witness to the truths there  are other proofs: First, in the turning of a circumference, the center  remains motionless. Next, changes in the length of the day and of the  seasons would ensue, were the position of the earth in the universe  not central, and it would not be equidistant from the two poles. (He  has previously disposed of infinity by stating that the heavens  revolve around the pole, which could not happen if a line drawn from  the center of the universe were infinitely projected).[182]  Furthermore, the earth must be at the center for its shadow to fall  upon the moon in an eclipse. He refers next to the Aristotelian  statement that to a simple body belongs one motion: the earth is a  simple body; therefore it can have but one motion. What is true of the  parts applies to the whole; all the parts of the earth are borne  toward the earth and there rest; therefore the whole earth is at rest.  Quiet is essential to growth. Lastly, if the earth moved as fast as it  must if it moves at all, everything would fly to pieces.[183]    [Footnote 178: Luther: _Tischreden_, IV, 575; \"Der Narr will die ganze  Kunst Astronomiae umkehren. Aber wie die heilige Schrift anzeigt, so  heiss Josua die Sonne still stehen, und nicht das Erdreich.\"]    [Footnote 179: \"Non est autem hominis bene instituti dissentire a  consensu tot saeculorum.\" Praefatio Philippi Melanthonis, 1531, in  Sacro-Busto: _Libellus de Sphaera_ (no date).]    [Footnote 180: \"Vidi dialogum et fui dissuassor editionis. Fabula per  sese paulatim consilescet; sed quidam putant esse egregiam  _katorthoma_ rem tam absurdam ornare, sicut ille Sarmaticus Astronomis  qui movet terram et figet solem. Profecto sapientes gubernatores  deberent ingeniorum petulantia cohercere.\" _Epistola B. Mithobio_, 16  Oct. 1541. P. Melancthon: _Opera_: IV, 679.]    [Footnote 181: \"Quamquam autem rident aliqui Physicum testimonia  divina citantem, tamen nos honestum esse censemus, Philosophiam  conferre ad coelestia dicta, et in tanta caligine humanae mentis  autoritatem divinam consulere ubicunque possumus.\" Melancthon: _Initia  Doctrinae Physicae_: Bk. I, 63.]    [Footnote 182: Ibid: 60.]    [Footnote 183: Ibid: 59-67.]    Melancthon thus sums up the usual arguments from the Scriptures, from  Aristotle, Ptolemy and the then current physics, in opposition to this  theory. Not only did he publish his own textbook on physics, but he  republished Sacrobosco's famous introduction to astronomy, writing for  it a preface urging diligent study of this little text endorsed by so  many generations of scholars.    Calvin, the great teacher of the Protestant Revolt, apparently was  little touched by this new intellectual current.[184] He did write a  semi-popular tract[185] against the so called \"judicial\" astrology,  then widely accepted, which he, like Luther, condemns as a foolish  superstition, though he values \"la vraie science d'astrologie\" from  which men understand not merely the order and place of the stars and  planets, but the causes of things. In his _Commentaries_, he accepts  the miracle of the sun's standing still at Joshua's command as proof  of the faith Christ commended, so strong that it will remove  mountains; and he makes reference only to the time-honored Ptolemaic  theory in his discussion of Psalm XIX.[186]    [Footnote 184: Farrar: _Hist. of Interpretation_: Preface, xviii:  \"Who,\" asks Calvin, \"will venture to place the authority of Copernicus  above that of the Holy Spirit?\"]    [Footnote 185: Calvin: _Oeuvres Francois_: _Traite ... contre  l'Astrologie_, 110-112.]    [Footnote 186: Calvin: _Op. Om._ in _Corpus Reformatorum_: vol. 25,  499-500; vol. 59, 195-196.]    For the absolute authority of the Pope the Protestant leaders  substituted the absolute authority of the Bible. It is not strange,  then, that they ignored or derided a theory as yet unsupported by  proof and so difficult to harmonize with a literally accepted Bible.    How widespread among the people generally did this theory become in  the years immediately following the publication of the _De  Revolutionibus_? M. Flammarion, in his _Vie de Copernic_ (1872),  refers[187] to the famous clock in the Strasburg Cathedral as having  been constructed by the University of Strasburg in protest against the  action taken by the Holy Office against Galileo, (though the clock  was constructed in 1571 and Galileo was not condemned until 1633).  This astronomical clock constructed only thirty years after the death  of Copernicus, he claims represented the Copernican system of the  universe with the planets revolving around the sun, and explained  clearly in the sight of the people what was the thought of the makers.  Lest no one should miscomprehend, he adds, the portrait of Copernicus  was placed there with this inscription: Nicolai Copernici vera  effigies, ex ipsius autographo depicta.    [Footnote 187: P. 78-79: \"Ce planetaire ... represente le systeme du  monde tel qu'il a ete explique par Copernic.\"]    This would be important evidence of the spread of the theory were it  true. But M. Flammarion must have failed to see a brief description of  the Strasburg Clock written in 1856 by Charles Schwilgue, son of the  man who renovated its mechanism in 1838-1842. He describes the clock  as it was before his father made it over and as it is today.  Originally constructed in 1352, it was replaced in 1571 by an  astrolabe based on the Ptolemaic system; six hands with the zodiacal  signs of the planets gave their daily movements and, together with a  seventh representing the sun, revolved around a map of the world.[188]  When M. Schwilgue repaired the clock in 1838, he changed it to  harmonize with the Copernican system.[189]    [Footnote 188: Schwilgue: p. 15.]    [Footnote 189: Ibid: p. 48.]    But within eighteen years after the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3580"],[0,"Recollections of the Private Life of Napoleon — Complete (#8)"],[1,", a  bathroom, a cabinet, and a saloon, in which he gave audience in the  forenoon; of a second saloon, in which were stationed his aides-de-camp  on duty, and which he used as a dining-room; and also a very large  antechamber. Madame Bonaparte had her separate apartments on the ground  floor, the same which she afterwards occupied as Empress. Beneath the  suite of rooms occupied by the First Consul was the room of Bourrienne,  his private secretary, which communicated with the apartments of the  First Consul by means of a private staircase.    Although at this period there were already courtiers, there was not,  however, yet a court, and the etiquette was exceedingly simple. The  First Consul, as I believe I have already said, slept in the same bed  with his wife; and they lived together, sometimes at the Tuileries,  sometimes at Malmaison. As yet there were neither grand marshal, nor  chamberlains, nor prefects of the palace, nor ladies of honor, nor lady  ushers, nor ladies of the wardrobe, nor pages. The household of the  First Consul was composed only of M. Pfister, steward; Venard, chief  cook; Galliot, and Dauger, head servants; Colin, butler. Ripeau was  librarian; Vigogne, senior, in charge of the stables. Those attached to  his personal service were Hambard, head valet; Herbert, ordinary valet;  and Roustan, mameluke of the First Consul. There were, beside these,  fifteen persons to discharge the ordinary duties of the household. De  Bourrienne superintended everything, and regulated expenses, and,  although very strict, won the esteem and affection of every one.    He was kind, obliging, and above all very just; and consequently at the  time of his disgrace the whole household was much distressed. As for  myself, I retain a sincerely respectful recollection of him; and I  believe that, though he has had the misfortune to find enemies among the  great, he found among his inferiors only grateful hearts and sincere  regrets.    Some days after this installation, there was at the chateau a reception  of the diplomatic corps. It will be seen from the details, which I shall  give, how very simple at that time was the etiquette of what they already  called the Court.    At eight o'clock in the evening, the apartments of Madame Bonaparte,  situated, as I have just said, on the ground floor adjoining the garden,  were crowded with people. There was an incredible wealth of plumes,  diamonds, and dazzling toilets. The crowd was so great that it was found  necessary to throw open the bedroom of Madame Bonaparte, as the two  saloons were so full there was not room to move.    When, after much embarrassment and difficulty, every one had found a  place as they could, Madame Bonaparte was announced, and entered, leaning  on the arm of Talleyrand. She wore a dress of white muslin with short  sleeves, and a necklace of pearls. Her head was uncovered; and the  beautiful braids of her hair, arranged with charming negligence, were  held in place by a tortoise-shell comb. The flattering murmur which  greeted her appearance was most grateful to her; and never, I believe,  did she display more grace and majesty.    Talleyrand,       [Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord, born at Paris, 1754, was     descended from the counts of Perigord. Rendered lame by an     accident, he entered the clergy, and in 1788 became Bishop of Autun.     In the States-General he sided with the Revolution. During the     Reign of Terror he visited England and the United States. Recalled     in 1796, he became minister of foreign affairs under the Directory,     which post he retained under the Consulate. In 1806 he was made     Prince of Benevento. He soon fell into disgrace. Sided with the     Bourbons in 1814, and was minister at the congress of Vienna,     president of the council, and minister under the king. Died 1838.     --TRANS.]    giving his hand to Madame Bonaparte, had the honor of presenting to her,  one after another, the members of the Diplomatic Corps, not according to  their names, but that of the courts they represented. He then made with  her the tour of the two saloons, and the circuit of the second was only  half finished when the First Consul entered without being announced. He  was dressed in a very plain uniform, with a tricolored silk scarf, with  fringes of the same around his waist. He wore close-fitting pantaloons  of white cassimere, and top-boots, and held his hat in his hand. This  plain dress, in the midst of the embroidered coats loaded with cordons  and orders worn by the ambassadors and foreign dignitaries, presented a  contrast as striking as the toilette of Madame Bonaparte compared with  that of the other ladies present.    Before relating how I exchanged the service of Madame Bonaparte for that  of the chief of state, and a sojourn at Malmaison for the second campaign  of Italy, I think I should pause to recall one or two incidents which  belong to the time spent in the service of Madame Bonaparte. She loved  to sit up late, and, when almost everybody else had retired, to play a  game of billiards, or more often of backgammon. It happened on one  occasion that, having dismissed every one else, and not yet being sleepy,  she asked if I knew how to play billiards, and upon my replying in the  affirmative, requested me with charming grace to play with her; and I had  often afterwards the honor of doing so. Although I had some skill, I  always managed to let her beat me, which pleased her exceedingly. If  this was flattery, I must admit it; but I would have done the same  towards any other woman, whatever her rank and her relation to me, had  she been even half as lovely as was Madame Bonaparte.    The concierge of Malmaison, who possessed the entire confidence of his  employers, among other means of precaution and watchfulness conceived by  him in order to protect the residence and person of the First Consul from  any sudden attack, had trained for the chateau several large dogs, among  which were two very handsome Newfoundlands. Work on the improvements of  Malmaison went on incessantly, and a large number of workmen lodged there  at night, who were carefully warned not to venture out alone; but one  night as some of the watchdogs were with the workmen in their lodgings,  and allowed themselves to be caressed, their apparent docility encouraged  one of these men to attempt the imprudence of venturing out. Believing  that the surest way to avoid danger was to put himself under the  protection of one of those powerful animals, he took one of them with  him, and in a very friendly manner they passed out of the door together;  but no sooner had they reached the outside, than the dog sprang upon his  unfortunate companion and threw him down. The cries of the poor workman  brought some of the guard, who ran to his aid. Just in time; for the dog  was holding him fast to the ground, and had seized him by the throat. He  was rescued, badly wounded. Madame Bonaparte, when she was informed of  this accident, had him nursed till perfectly cured, and gave him a  handsome gratuity, but recommended him to be more prudent in the future.    Every moment that the First Consul could snatch from affairs of state he  passed at Malmaison. The evening of each decadii       [Under the Republic, Sunday was abolished. A decade of ten days     was substituted for the week; and the decadi, or tenth day, took the     place of the Sabbath.--TRANS.]    was a time of expectation and joy at the chateau. Madame Bonaparte sent  domestics on horseback and on foot to meet her husband, and often went  herself, accompanied by her daughter and her Malmaison friends. When not  on duty, I went myself and alone: for everybody felt for the First  Consul the same affection, and experienced in regard to him the same  anxiety; and such was the bitterness and boldness of his enemies that the  road, though short, between Paris and Malmaison was full of dangers and  snares. We knew that many plans had been laid to kidnap him on this  road, and that these attempts might be renewed. The most dangerous spot  was the quarries of Nanterre, of which I have already spoken; so they  were carefully examined, and guarded by his followers each day on which  the First Consul was to pass, and finally the depressions nearest the  road were filled up. The First Consul was gratified by our devotion to  him, and gave us proofs of his satisfaction, though he himself seemed  always free from fear or uneasiness. Very often, indeed, he mildly  ridiculed our anxiety, and would relate very seriously to the good  Josephine what a narrow escape he had on the road; how men of a sinister  appearance had shown themselves many times on his way; how one of them  had had the boldness to aim at him, etc. And when he saw her well  frightened, he would burst out laughing, give her some taps or kisses on  her cheek and neck, saying to her, \"Have no fear, little goose; they  would not dare.\" On these \"days of furlough,\" as he called them, he was  occupied more with his private affairs than with those of state; but  never could he remain idle. He would make them pull down, put up again,  build, enlarge, set out, prune, incessantly, both in the chateau and in  the park, while he examined the bills of expenses, estimated receipts,  and ordered economies. Time passed quickly in all these occupations; and  the moment soon came when it was necessary to return, and, as he  expressed it, put on again the yoke of misery.          CHAPTER IV.    Towards the end of March, 1800, five or six months after my entrance into  the service of Madame. Bonaparte, the First Consul while at dinner one  day regarded me intently; and having carefully scrutinized and measured  me from head to foot, \"Young man,\" said he, \"would you like to go with me  on the campaign?\" I replied, with much emotion, that I would ask nothing  better. \"Very well, then, you shall go with me!\" and on rising from the  table, he ordered"]]]
