We go on; we descend the  hill, the northern slope of the Quirinal, and find ourselves in the  alluvial ground of Tiber and Anio. We have now come near to the meeting  of the streams; Anio is spanned by a bridge which at first sight might  seem to be wholly a thing of yesterday, but which in truth has lived  and gone through much from the earliest times to the latest. Broken  down and rebuilt over and over again, from the wars of Narses to those  of Garibaldi, its main arch is indeed of the newest workmanship; but  if we go down to the banks we see the smaller side arches, which must  have been ancient when they were crossed by Hannibal, perhaps hardly  new when they were crossed by Cossus. A few steps further, and we come  to another record of change; an ancient tomb has grown into a mediaeval  tower; the mediaeval tower now proclaims itself as an \"osteria\"; but  we feel hardly tempted to try its powers of entertainment. We are now  fairly in the low ground; the hills of Rome lie behind us; the hills  beyond Tiber which skirt the Flaminian way rise to our left; the hills  of Fidenae are before us. To the right lies the ground between the  Salarian and the Nomentane road where Phaon had his villa and where his  master Nero came by his end. Presently the road, and its companion the  railway, pass close under hills to the right and, at one point, with  Tiber close by them to the left. A little further on they pass between  hills on either side, a loftier and isolated height to the left, a  range of lower hills, broken by more than one stream and its valley to  the right. We are in the heart of forsaken Fidenae, in the pass which  divides its soaring akropolis by the river from the body of the city on  the inland side.    The _arx_ of Fidenae, now the hill of Castel Giubeleo, is not, indeed,  a height like that of Tusculum or that of Cortona; but it comes nearer  to them than anything to be found at Veii or Rome. A bend of the river  leaves a rich alluvial flat between its bank and a hill which on that  side rises steeply enough. Here the men of the faithless Latin city  could look out to their friends beyond the river, over the mouth of  the small but famous stream of Cremera, over the hills on either side,  the Fabian outpost, the future home of Livia, far away, if not to Veii  itself, yet to points further off than Veii. The view from the _arx_  of Fidenae and the view from the hill of Livia complete one another.  Inland we see Rome on its hills; but we must again remark that when  Fidenae was, Rome sent up no lofty towers and cupolas to mark its place  against the horizon. At our feet we see the lower hills occupied by the  rest of the town, surely a modern settlement compared with the original  _arx_. We go over its site and round its site, we mark its tombs, its  _cloaca_, the place where its gates once were. The walk in the valley  by the brook between the lower hill of Fidenae and the hill which lies  between Fidenae and Rome brings the features of the place well out. It  was no small gain for Veii to have such a confederate on Latin ground  as the strong post which we are compassing. We can well understand  why Rome on the first opportunity swept Fidenae utterly away, while the  existence of Veii had to be endured for a generation longer.    As at Veii, so at Fidenae, the traces of the living are gone--yet more  utterly at Fidenae than at Veii. The traces of the dead are far more  plentiful, though Fidenae has nothing to set against the painted tomb of  Veii. The city, doubtless, perished after the war in which Cossus won  the spoils of Tolumnius. Strabo speaks of Fidenae as a deserted place,  the possession of a single man. Yet the _potestas_ of Fidenae--perhaps  its dictator--may have lingered on, as such dignitaries have lingered  on in the boroughs once threatened by Sir Charles Dilke.          Antemnae.      It is one of the amiable features of the study of historical topography  that its votaries are so easily pleased. Two places may have equal  charms on utterly opposite grounds. The merit of one city is that  it has lived on uninterruptedly from the earliest times till now.  The merit of another city is that it ceased to live at all many ages  back. One is precious because it contains a series of monuments of  all ages. Another is equally precious because all its monuments are  of one age. A third is as precious as either because it contains no  monuments at all. This last kind of charm may seem paradoxical; but it  will be acknowledged by every one who has given himself heartily to  this kind of research. At Veii and at Fidenae the great merit is that  there is, speaking roughly, nothing to see there; in truth there is the  more to see because there is nothing to see. No doubt Veii and Fidenae  untouched, as they stood under Lars Tolumnius, would be best of all;  but we set that aside among the things which it is no use hoping for.  And no doubt if we found the sites of Veii and Fidenae full of Roman  and mediaeval monuments, we should doubtless be glad to see them; but,  as they are not there, we are still more glad that they are away. But  we turn from Veii and Fidenae to a city compared with which Veii and  Fidenae might seem to have a wealth of monuments. It is, after all,  an exaggeration to say that nothing is left of Veii or of Fidenae. The  sites are the main things; but there really is something to see beside  the sites. But there is a city, at least the site of a city, much  nearer to Rome than either of them, of which the great charm is that it  does not contain a single monument of any kind or date. Here we can,  even more truly than at Veii and at Fidenae, say that the very ruins  have perished; but it is just because the very ruins have perished  yet more utterly than elsewhere that the spot has a strong and special  attraction of its own.    We took a kind of Pisgah view of Antemnae both from the road to the  White Hens and from the road to Fidenae. As we before said, it ought  to be examined as one of the objects on this last road; only things  are not always as they ought to be. We must therefore start afresh  from the Flaminian gate and for the third time make our way to the  Milvian bridge. This time as our course is to lead us to one of the  oldest sites in Roman history, it may be well, by way of contrast,  to let the bridge call up thoughts of warfare yet later than that  of Constantine. It was on the Roman side of the Milvian bridge, when  the bridge itself, which he had fortified, was betrayed to the Gothic  enemy, that Belisarius, with another Maxentius at his side, withstood  the host which Witigis had led from Narnia. Readers either of Procopius  or of Gibbon must remember how every dart was aimed at the bay horse,  and how the rider of the bay horse escaped without a wound. This time  we keep ourselves, with Belisarius, on the Roman side of the bridge. We  are therefore not tempted to have our thoughts carried off into quite  another part of the world by the statue of a famous Bohemian saint,  who is said by some Bohemian scholars to be a purely imaginary being.  Our present business is not with Saint John Nepomuk, not even with  Belisarius or with Constantine; we have to do with times before Rome  was, when Tiber still parted the free Etruscan from the free Latin. We  walk along his left bank, keeping within the bounds of Latium, but with  the eye tempted at every moment to look across to the opposite, the  Etruscan bank. Both banks are so quiet, both are so nearly forsaken,  both come so easily within an ordinary walk from our Roman quarters,  that it is hard to call up the days when Tiber was the boundary  stream, not merely of separate commonwealths, not merely of distinct  and hostile nations, but of nations between which there was no tie  of origin, language, or religion. To be sold beyond the Tiber was the  most frightful of all dooms which spared life and limb. If the debtor  were sold to Ardea or Tusculum, he might win his freedom and become a  denizen of a city of his own speech. To sell him beyond the Tiber was  like handing him over to bondage among Turks or Moors. But our path  keeps us on the Latin side, in a land which, when it was inhabited at  all, was inhabited by men of an intelligible speech. We peer under a  rocky cliff, the riverward slope of the hill which rises just outside  the Flaminian Gate of Rome. On that hill Witigis held his headquarters  when Belisarius and Saint Peter between them guarded the Pincian.  But, we ask, why did not some city, why did not Rome itself, arise on  a site which seems so thoroughly suited for the needs of an ancient  settlement? But we have to go further for what we seek; no record tells  of any settlement on the Monte Parioli. We pass on by a few tombs in  the hill-side, and we more distinctly make out the shape of a grassy  hill parted by a wide alluvial plain from the river on the eastern  side by which we approach. That is the hill of Antemnae, a vanished  city whose legendary story may be summed up in a few but instructive  words. Antemnae was older than Rome. It was one of the towns whose  daughters supplied objects for that great act of what our forefathers  called _Quenfang_, what sociologists called _exogamy_, which secured  that the Roman State should last more than one generation. War follows;  Rome prevails; Hersilia, wife of Romulus, but so strangely mother of  nobody, pleads for the conquered, and Antemnae is merged, in Rome. We  may be sure that this is the genuine story, rather than others which  give Antemnae a longer life. In sober history its sole record seems to  be that in Strabo's day the town had wholly passed away, and that the  site was, as now, like Fidenae, the possession of a single man.    The story in Livy is well imagined. The city whose people Romulus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],[0,"\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#8)"],[1,"in whose name the Church itself exists, as  well as their office in it.  If all men were to learn that the  Church professes to believe in a Christ of punishment and warfare,  not of forgiveness, no one would believe in the Church and it  could not prove to anyone what it is trying to prove.    The second, somewhat less gross, form of argument consists in  declaring that, though Christ did indeed preach that we should  turn the left cheek, and give the cloak also, and this is the  highest moral duty, yet that there are wicked men in the world,  and if these wicked men mere not restrained by force, the whole  world and all good men would come to ruin through them.  This  argument I found for the first time in John Chrysostom, and I show  how he is mistaken in my book \"What I believe.\"    This argument is ill grounded, because if we allow ourselves to  regard any men as intrinsically wicked men, then in the first  place we annul, by so doing, the whole idea of the Christian  teaching, according to which we are all equals and brothers, as  sons of one father in heaven.  Secondly, it is ill founded,  because even if to use force against wicked men had been permitted  by God, since it is impossible to find a perfect and unfailing  distinction by which one could positively know the wicked from the  good, so it would come to all individual men and societies of men  mutually regarding each other as wicked men, as is the case now.  Thirdly, even if it were possible to distinguish the wicked from  the good unfailingly, even then it would be impossible to kill or  injure or shut up in prison these wicked men, because there would  be no one in a Christian society to carry out such punishment,  since every Christian, as a Christian, has been commanded to use  no force against the wicked.    The third kind of answer, still more subtle than the preceding,  consists in asserting that though the command of non-resistance to  evil by force is binding on the Christian when the evil is  directed against himself personally, it ceases to be binding when  the evil is directed against his neighbors, and that then the  Christian is not only not bound to fulfill the commandment, but is  even bound to act in opposition to it in defense of his neighbors,  and to use force against transgressors by force.  This assertion  is an absolute assumption, and one cannot find in all Christ's  teaching any confirmation of such an argument.  Such an argument  is not only a limitation, but a direct contradiction and negation  of the commandment.  If every man has the right to have recourse  to force in face of a danger threatening an other, the question of  the use of force is reduced to a question of the definition of  danger for another.  If my private judgment is to decide the  question of what is danger for another, there is no occasion for  the use of force which could not be justified on the ground of  danger threatening some other man.  They killed and burnt witches,  they killed aristocrats and girondists, they killed their enemies  because those who were in authority regarded them as dangerous for  the people.    If this important limitation, which fundamentally undermines the  whole value of the commandment, had entered into Christ's meaning,  there must have been mention of it somewhere.  This restriction is  made nowhere in our Saviour's life or preaching.  On the contrary,  warning is given precisely against this treacherous and scandalous  restriction which nullifies the commandment.  The error and  impossibility of such a limitation is shown in the Gospel with  special clearness in the account of the judgment of Caiaphas, who  makes precisely this distinction.  He acknowledged that it was  wrong to punish the innocent Jesus, but he saw in him a source of  danger not for himself, but for the whole people, and therefore he  said: It is better for one man to die, that the whole people  perish not.  And the erroneousness of such a limitation is still  more clearly expressed in the words spoken to Peter when he tried  to resist by force evil directed against Jesus (Matt. xxvi. 52).  Peter was not defending himself, but his beloved and heavenly  Master.  And Christ at once reproved him for this, saying, that he  who takes up the sword shall perish by the sword.    Besides, apologies for violence used against one's neighbor in defense  of another neighbor from greater violence are always untrustworthy,  because when force is used against one who has not yet carried out his  evil intent, I can never know which would be greater--the evil of my act  of violence or of the act I want to prevent. We kill the criminal that  society may be rid of him, and we never know whether the criminal of  to-day would not have been a changed man tomorrow, and whether our  punishment of him is not useless cruelty. We shut up the dangerous--as  we think--member of society, but the next day this man might cease to be  dangerous and his imprisonment might be for nothing. I see that a man I  know to be a ruffian is pursuing a young girl. I have a gun in my  hand--I kill the ruffian and save the girl. But the death or the  wounding of the ruffian has positively taken place, while what would  have happened if this had not been I cannot know. And what an immense  mass of evil must result, and indeed does result, from allowing men to  assume the right of anticipating what may happen. Ninety-nine per cent  of the evil of the world is founded on this reasoning--from the  Inquisition to dynamite bombs, and the executions or punishments of tens  of thousands of political criminals.    A fourth, still more refined, reply to the question, What ought to  be the Christian's attitude to Christ's command of non-resistance  to evil by force? consists in declaring that they do not deny the  command of non-resisting evil, but recognize it; but they only do  not ascribe to this command the special exclusive value attached  to it by sectarians.  To regard this command as the indispensable  condition of Christian life, as Garrison, Ballou, Dymond, the  Quakers, the Mennonites and the Shakers do now, and as the  Moravian brothers, the Waldenses, the Albigenses, the Bogomilites,  and the Paulicians did in the past, is a one-sided heresy.  This  command has neither more nor less value than all the other  commands, and the man who through weakness transgresses any  command whatever, the command of non-resistance included, does not  cease to be a Christian if he hold the true faith.  This is a very  skillful device, and many people who wish to be deceived are  easily deceived by it.  The device consists in reducing a direct  conscious denial of a command to a casual breach of it.  But one  need only compare the attitude of the teachers of the Church to  this and to other commands which they really do recognize, to be  convinced that their attitude to this is completely different from  their attitude to other duties.    The command against fornication they do really recognize, and  consequently they do not admit that in any case fornication can  cease to be wrong.  The Church preachers never point out cases in  which the command against fornication can be broken, and always  teach that we must avoid seductions which lead to temptation to  fornication.  But not so with the command of non-resistance.  All  church preachers recognize cases in which that command can be  broken, and teach the people accordingly.  And they not only do  not teach teat we should avoid temptations to break it, chief of  which is the military oath, but they themselves administer it.  The preachers of the Church never in any other case advocate the  breaking of any other commandment.  But in connection with the  commandment of non-resistance they openly teach that we must not  understand it too literally, but that there are conditions and  circumstances in which we must do the direct opposite, that is, go  to law, fight, punish.  So that occasions for fulfilling the  commandment of non-resistance to evil by force are taught for the  most part as occasions for not fulfilling it.  The fulfillment of  this command, they say, is very difficult and pertains only to  perfection.  And how can it not be difficult, when the breach of  it is not only not forbidden, but law courts, prisons, cannons,  guns, armies, and wars are under the immediate sanction of the  Church?  It cannot be true, then, that this command is recognized  by the preachers of the Church as on a level with other commands.    The preachers of the Church clearly, do not recognize it; only not  daring to acknowledge this, they try to conceal their not  recognizing it.    So much for the fourth reply.    The fifth kind of answer, which is the subtlest, the most often  used, and the most effective, consists in avoiding answering, in  making believe that this question is one which has long ago been  decided perfectly clearly and satisfactorily, and that it is not  worth while to talk about it.  This method of reply is employed by  all the more or less cultivated religious writers, that is to say,  those who feel the laws of Christ binding for themselves.  Knowing  that the contradiction existing between the teaching of Christ  which we profess with our lips and the whole order of our lives  cannot be removed by words, and that touching upon it can only  make it more obvious, they, with more or less ingenuity, evade it,  pretending that the question of reconciling Christianity with the  use of force has been decided already, or does not exist at all.        [Footnote: I only know one work which differs somewhat from      this general definition, and that is not a criticism in the      precise meaning of the word, but an article treating of the      same subject and having my book in view.  I mean the pamphlet      of Mr. Troizky (published at Kazan), \"A Sermon for the      People.\"  The author obviously accepts Christ's teaching in      its true meaning.  He"]]]
