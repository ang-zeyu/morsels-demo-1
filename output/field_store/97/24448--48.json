[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],[0,"Seven Little Australians (#8)"],[1,"she aped in everything,  and was considerably wiser in the world than simple-minded,  romantic Meg.    She lent Meg novels, \"Family Herald Supplements\", \"Young Ladies'  Journals\", and such publications, and the young girl took to them  with avidity, surprised at the new world into which they took her;  for Charlotte Yonge and Louisa Alcott and Miss Wetherall had hitherto  formed her simple and wholesome fare.    Meg began to dream rose-coloured dreams of the time when her fair,  shining hair should be gathered up into \"a simple knot at the back  of her head\" or \"brushed into a regal coronet,\" these being the  styles in which the heroines in the novels invariably dressed  their hair.  A pigtail done in three was very unromantic.  That  was why, as a sort of compromise, she cut herself a fringe and  began to frizz out the end of her plait.  Her father stared at her,  and said she looked like a shop-girl, when first he noticed it,  and Esther told her she was a stupid child; but the looking-glass  and Aldith reassured her.    The next thing was surreptitiously to lengthen her dresses, which  were at the short-long stage.  In the privacy of her own bedroom  she took the skirts of two or three of her frocks off the band,  inserted a piece of lining for lengthening purposes, and then  added a frill to the waists of her bodices to hide the join.  This  dropped the skirts a good two inches, and made her look quite a  tall, slim figure, as she was well aware.    And none of these things were very harmful.    But Aldith gradually grew dissatisfied with her waist.    \"You're at least twenty-three, Marguerite,\" she said once, quite in  a horrified way. She never called her friend Meg, pronouncing that  name to be \"too domestic and altogether unlovely.\"    Meg glanced from her own waist to her friend's slender, beautiful  one, and sighed profoundly.  \"What ought I to be?\" she said in a  low tone; and Aldith had answered, \"Eighteen--or nineteen,  Marguerite, at the most; true symmetrical grace can never be  obtained with a waist twenty-three inches round.\"    Aldith had not only made statements and comparisons, she had given  her friend practical advice, and shown her how the thing was to be  done.  And every night and morning Meg pulled away ruthlessly  at her corset laces, and crushed her beautiful little body into  narrower space.  She had already brought it within a girdle of  twenty-one inches, which was a clear saving of two, and she had  taken in all her dresses at the seams.    But she gave up the evening game of cricket, and she never made one  at rounders now, much to the others' disgust.  No one, to look at  the sweet blossom-like face, and soft, calm eyes, could have  guessed what torture was being felt beneath the now pretty,  welt-fitting dress body.  To walk quickly was positive pain; to  stoop, almost agony; but she endured it all with a heroism  worthy of a truly noble cause.    \"How long shall I have to go on like this, Aldith?\" she asked  once faintly, after a French lesson that she had scarcely been  able to sit through.    And the older girl answered carelessly, \"Oh, you mustn't leave  it off, of course, but you don't feel it at all after a bit.\"    With which assurance Meg pursued her painful course.    Esther, the only person in a position to exercise any authority  in the matter, had not noticed at all, and, indeed, had she done,  so would not have thought very gravely of it, for it was only  four years since she, too, had been sixteen, and a \"waist\" had  been the most desirable thing on earth.    Once she had said unwittingly,    \"What a nice little figure you are getting, Meg; this new  dressmaker certainly fits better than Miss Quinn\"; and foolish  Meg, with a throb of delight, had redoubled her efforts.    Lynx-eyed Judy would have found her out long ago, and laughed her  to utter shame, but unfortunately for Meg's constitution she  was still at school, it being now the third month of her  absence.    Aldith only lived about twenty minutes' walk from Misrule, so  the two girls were always together.  Twice a week they went down  to town in the river-boat to learn how to inquire, in polite  French, \"Has the baker's young daughter the yellow hat, brown  gloves, and umbrella of the undertaker's niece?\" And twice a  week, after they had answered irrelevantly, \"No, but the surgeon  had some beer, some mustard, and the dinner-gong,\" Aldith conducted  her friend slowly up and down that happy hunting-ground of  Sydney youth and fashion--the Block.  \"Just see how many hats  I'll get taken off,\" Miss Aldith would say as they started; and  by the end of the time Meg would say longingly, \"How lovely it must  be to know crowds of gentlemen like you do.\"    Sometimes one or two of them would stop and exchange a word or two,  and then Aldith would formally introduce Meg; often, however, the  latter, who was sharp enough for all her foolishness, would fancy  she detected a patronizing, amused air in these gentlemen's  manners.  As, indeed, there often was; they were chiefly men  whom Aldith had met at dances and tennis in her own home; and  who thought that young lady a precocious child who wanted keeping  in the schoolroom a few more years.    One day Aldith came to Misrule brimming over with mysterious  importance.  \"Come down the garden, Marguerite,\" she said,  taking no notice whatever of Baby, who had, with much difficulty,  beguiled her eldest sister into telling her the ever delightful  legend of the three little pigs.    \"Oh, no, by the hair of my chiny-chin-chin, then I'll huff and  I'll puff and I'll blow your house in,\" had only been said twice,  and the exciting part was still to come.    Baby looked up with stormy eyes.    \"Go away, Aldiff,\" she said.    \"Miss MacCarthy,--Baby, dear,\" Meg suggested, gently, catching Aldith's  half-scornful smile.    \"ALDIFF,\" repeated Baby obstinately.  Then she relented, and put  one caressing little arm round her sister's neck.    \"I will say Miff MacCarfy iss you will say ze uzzer little pig,  too.\"    \"Oh, send her away, Marguerite, do,\" Aldith said impatiently,  \"I have an enthralling secret to tell you, and I'll have to go soon.\"    Meg looked interested immediately.    \"Run away, Baby, dear,\" she said, kissing the disappointed little  face; \"go and play Noah's Ark with Bunty, and I'll finish the  piggies to-night or to-morrow.\"    \"But I want them NOW,\" Baby said insistently.    Meg pushed her gently aside.  \"No, run away, pet--run away at once  like a good girl, and I'll tell you Red Riding Hood, too, to-morrow.\"    Baby looked up at her sister's guest.    \"You are a horrid old pig, Aldiff MacCatfy,\" she said, with slow  emphasis, \"an' I hates you hard, an' we all hates you here, 'ceps Meg;  and Pip says you're ze jammiest girl out, an' I wis' a drate big ziant  would come and huff and puff and blow you into ze middlest part of  ze sea.\"    Aldith laughed, a little aggravating grown-up laugh, that put the  finishing touch to Baby's anger.  She put out her little hand and  gave the guest's arm in its muslin sleeve a sharp, scientific pinch  that Pip had taught her.  Then she fled madly away down the long  paddocks, to the bit of bush beyond.    \"Insufferable,\" Aldith muttered angrily, and it needed all Meg's  apologies and coaxings to get her into an amiable frame of mind  again, and to induce her to communicate the enthralling secret.    At last, however, it was imparted, with great impressiveness.  Aldith's eldest sister was engaged, engaged to be married!  Oh!  wasn't it heavenly?  Wasn't it romantic?--and to the gentleman with  the long fair moustache who had been so much at their house lately.    \"I knew it would come--I have seen it coming for a long time.  Oh! I'm not easily blinded;\" Aldith said.  \"I know true love when  I see it.  Though certainly for myself I should prefer a dark  moustache, should not you, Marguerite?\"    \"Ye--es,\" said Meg.  Her views were hardly formed yet on the  subject.    \"Jet black, with waxed ends, very stiff,\" Aldith continued  thoughtfully, \"and a soldierly carriage, and very long black  lashes.\"    \"So should I,\" Meg said, fired in a moment.  \"Like Guy Deloraine  in 'Angelina's Ambition'.\"  Aldith put her arm more tightly round  her friend.    \"Wouldn't it be HEAVENLY, Marguerite, to be engaged--you and I?\"  she said, in a tone of dreamy rapture.  \"To have a dark,  handsome man with proud black eyes just dying with love for you,  going down on his knees, and giving you presents, and taking you  out and all--oh, Marguerite, just think of it!\"    Melt's eyes looked wistful.  \"We're not old enough, though, yet,\"  she said with a sigh.    Aldith tossed her head.  \"That's nonsense; why, Clara Allison is  only seventeen, and look at your own stepmother.  Plenty of girls  are actually married at sixteen, Marguerite, and a man proposed  my sister Beatrice when she was only fifteen.\"  Meg looked  impressed and thoughtful.    Then Aldith rose to go.  \"Mind you're in time for the boat  to-morrow,\" she said, as they reached the gate; \"and, Marguerite,  be sure you make yourself look very nice--wear your cornflower  dress, and see if Mrs. Woolcot will lend you a pair of her gloves,  your grey ones are just a little shabby, aren't they, dear?\"    \"H'm,\" said Meg, colouring.    \"And Mr. James Graham always comes back on that boat, and the two  Courtney boys--Andrew Courtney told Beatrice he thought you seemed  a nice little thing; he often notices you, he says, because you  blush so.\"    \"I can't help it,\" Meg said, unhappily.  \"Aldith, how ought the  ribbon to go on my hat?  I'm going to retrim it again.\"    \"Oh, square bows, somewhat stiff, and well at the side,\" the oracle,  said.  \"I'm glad you're going to, dear, it looked just a wee bit  dowdy, didn't it?\"  Meg coloured again.    \"Have you done your French?\" she said, as she pulled open the  gate.    \"In a way,\" Aldith said carelessly.  Then she put up her chin,  \"Those frowzy-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47316"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 2 of 3) (#8)"],[1,"by Nephi, son of Lehi, who engraved the description in his  record, at least as early as the first quarter of the sixth century B.  C.:        And after they [Lehi's colony] had given thanks unto the God of      Israel, my father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon      the plates of brass, and he did search them from beginning. And      he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses, which      gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of Adam and      Eve, who were our first parents; and also a record of the Jews      from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign      of Zedekiah, king of Judah; and also the prophecies of the holy      prophets, from the beginning even down to the commencement of the      reign of Zedekiah, and also many prophecies which have been spoken      by the mouth of Jeremiah. And it came to pass that my father, Lehi,      also found upon the plates of brass, a genealogy of his fathers;      wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even      that Joseph who was the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and      who was preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve      his father, Jacob, and all his household from perishing with      famine. And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land      of Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them. And thus my      father, Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his fathers. (I Nephi      5:10-16.)    What a testimony we have here for the truth of the Bible! What a number  of its incidents are here confirmed! The Higher Criticism questions  the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, but here is an entry made in  an ancient record in America at least 575 years B. C., attributing the  authorship of five books to Moses, specifying that they gave an account  of the creation of the world and also of Adam and Eve, \"who were our  first parents;\" so that there can be no question as to this record  brought by Lehi's colony from Jerusalem to America being identical  with the Pentateuch of our Bible. In addition to the incident of the  creation, and Adam and Eve, this entry upon the Nephite records also  confirms the Bible narrative concerning Jacob and also of Joseph, his  son, who was sold into captivity and taken to Egypt. Reference is made  also to the subsequent exodus of Israel from the land of Egypt. Mention  also is made of the prophets and their prophecies in this record,  making special mention of the name of Jeremiah. Some of the writings  of Jeremiah were also included in this record. The first Nephi also  makes special mention of Isaiah by name, and describes in what manner  he read from his writings upon the plates of brass, to his brethren.  [2] And what is better yet, he quotes, in his record, many passages  from the prophet Isaiah. At this point it is well to call attention to  the fact that the Higher Criticism holds that the book of Isaiah in  our Old Testament is composite; that is, it claims that it is composed  by at least two, and perhaps by seven different authors; that the  last twenty-seven chapters certainly were not written by Isaiah. The  best answer that can be made to these claims, on the part of those  disposed to defend the Isaiah authorship of the book of prophecies  which bears that prophet's name, is to say that from two hundred years  B. C. the authorship of the prophecies, as they now stand in the  Bible, have been attributed to Isaiah. But here is testimony, in this  first book of Nephi, which shows that as early as 550 years B. C., a  certain collection of prophecies in a record taken from Jerusalem,  are attributed to Isaiah; and what is best of all a transcription is  made from these prophecies into the Nephite record, which corresponds  to chapters 48, 49, 50, 51 and 59, and also fragments of chapter 29;  [3] being a very large amount of the very part of Isaiah's prophecies  of which the authenticity is questioned. Here are at least five of  the twenty-seven chapters in dispute accounted for and fragments of  another, while of the first part of the prophecies of Isaiah there is  a transcription into the Nephite record corresponding to chapters from  two to fourteen; [4] so that so far as the authenticity of the book of  Isaiah's prophecies is concerned, and the five books of Moses, the Book  of Mormon is the most important of all witnesses.    Third: Since the Nephites, then, in this collection of brass plates,  had the five books of Moses and the writings of the prophets down to  the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, it is to be expected that in  their own record-making frequent reference would be made to the brass  plates and their contents, and this is the case. The first Nephi speaks  of Israel's passage of the red sea, under the leadership of Moses; and  the destruction of the Egyptian army. [5] Subsequently the same writer  refers to the captivity of the children of Israel in Egypt, and the  grievousness of their bondage; of their escape from their slavery;  their being fed with manna in the wilderness; their being miraculously  provided with water from the smitten rock; the visible presence of God  in the cloud by day and the pillar of light by night; the blind and  rebellious spirit of the people; the judgment of God upon them in the  fiery-flying serpents, and the healing provided for them by looking  upon the brazen serpent erected by Moses. [6]    The prophet Lehi, near the close of his life, when blessing his  son Joseph, refers to Joseph, the son of Jacob, of Egyptian fame,  and speaks of a prophecy uttered by that patriarch concerning the  deliverance of the people under the leadership of Moses; and also of  a future seer of the same lineage as himself, (i. e. Joseph) who would  be mighty in bringing forth the word of God unto the remnant of Lehi's  seed. [7] In the book of Helaman will be found further reference to  many of the same things. [8] Special reference is made also to the  prophecy of Moses concerning the future coming of the Messiah, saying,  \"A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him  shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it  shall come to pass that all those who will not hear that prophet shall  be cut off from among the people.\" Nephi follows this passage with the  declaration that this prophet of whom Moses spake is the Holy One of  Israel, the Messiah. [9] The ten commandments are quoted in the book  of Mosiah, substantially as they are found in the book of Exodus. [10]  And thus throughout the Nephite record frequent references are made to  these ancient things of the scriptures, all of which, found as they are  in an ancient record, though revealed to the world through the prophet  Joseph Smith in modern times, confirm the authenticity and credibility  of the Bible.    Fourth: It is the Book of Mormon as a whole, however, in which its  greatest value as a witness for the truth of the Bible, and the truth  of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, most appears. I mean the Book of Mormon  considered apart from any reference to an abridgment of the ancient  records of the Jaredites; and the transcriptions from the ancient  Hebrew scriptures carried by Lehi's colony to the western world. In the  Book of Mormon, so considered, we have the record of the hand-dealings  of God with the peoples that inhabited the western hemisphere. We have  in it the record of those things which occurred in a branch of the  house of Israel that God was preparing for the same great event for  which he was training the house of Israel in the eastern world; _viz._,  the advent of the Messiah, and the acceptance of the gospel through  which all mankind are to be saved. This branch of the house of Israel,  broken from the parent tree and planted in the western hemisphere,  brought with them the traditions and hopes of Israel; they brought with  them, as we have already seen, the Hebrew scriptures, the writings of  Moses and of the prophets down to the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;  but what is more important than all this, they came to the western  world with the favor and blessing of Israel's God upon them, and  Israel's peculiar privilege of direct communication with God, through  inspired dreams, the visitation of angels, and the voice of God. Lehi's  colony was led to the western world by prophets, inspired of the Lord,  their journey being marked by many and peculiar manifestations of his  presence with them. After their arrival in the western world, to them  a land of promise, the Lord from time to time raised up prophets among  them, who instructed them in the ways of the Lord; who reproved them  when overtaken in transgression; who pronounced judgments against  them when persuasion was of no avail for their correction; who warned  them by the spirit of prophecy of approaching disasters; and who held  continually before them the hope of Israel, the advent of the Messiah,  who, by his suffering and death on the cross, would redeem mankind.    It was much in this manner and for the same purpose that God dealt with  his people in the eastern world; and the fact that his course with the  people on the western hemisphere was substantially the same as that  followed with those of the east, establishes at once his justice and  mercy towards his children, and bears testimony to the great truths  that God indeed is no respecter of persons, and that in every land he  raises up for himself witnesses of his power and goodness. [11]    Fifth: It is not alone as a witness for the authenticity and  credibility of the Bible that the Book of Mormon is valuable. Great  as is its value in that particular, it is still more valuable as a  witness for the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Previous to the  coming of Messiah to the Nephites, [12] prophets testified of his  coming; predicted the time thereof and the signs that would accompany  his advent. The signs of his birth"]]]
