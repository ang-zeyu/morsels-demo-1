Something tells me  we shall have a golden time among the good folk of Prato.'    Perhaps it was the springtime that made Filippo so joyous that morning  as he rode along the dusty white road.    Spring had come with a glad rush, as she ever comes in Italy,  scattering on every side her flowers and favours. From under the dead  brown leaves of autumn, violets pushed their heads and perfumed all the  air. Under the grey olives the sprouting corn spread its tender green,  and the scarlet and purple of the anemones waved spring's banner far  and near. It was good to be alive on such a day.    Arrived at Prato, the two painters, with a favourite pupil called  Botticelli, worked together diligently, and covered wall after wall  with their frescoes. It seemed as if they would never be done, for each  church and convent had work awaiting them.    'Truly,' said Filippo one day when he was putting the last touches to a  portrait of Fra Diamante, whom he had painted into his picture of the  death of St. Stephen, 'I will undertake no more work for a while. It is  full time we had a holiday together.'    But even as he spoke a message was brought to him from the good abbess  of the convent of Santa Margherita, begging him to come and paint an  altarpiece for the sisters' chapel.    'Ah, well, what must be, must be,' he said to Fra Diamante, who stood  smiling by. 'I will do what I can to please these holy women, but after  that--no more.'    The staid and sober abbess met him at the convent door, and silently  led him through the sunny garden, bright with flowers, where the  lizards darted to right and left as they walked past the fountain and  entered the dim, cool chapel. In a low, sweet voice she told him what  they would have him paint, and showed him the space above the high  altar where the picture was to be placed.    'Our great desire is that thou shouldst paint for us the Holy Virgin  with the Blessed Child on the night of the Nativity,' she said.    The painter seemed to listen, but his attention wandered, and all the  time he wished himself back in the sunny garden, where he had seen a  fair young face looking through the pink sprays of almond blossoms,  while the music of the vesper hymn sounded sweet and clear in his ears.    'I will begin to-morrow,' he said with a start when the low voice of  the abbess stopped. 'I will paint the Madonna and Babe as thou  desirest.'    So next day the work began. And each time the abbess noiselessly  entered the room where the painter was at work and watched the picture  grow beneath his hand, she felt more and more sure that she had done  right in asking this painter to decorate their beloved chapel.    True, it was said by many that the young artist was but a worldly  minded man, not like the blessed Fra Angelico, the heavenly painter of  San Marco; but his work was truly wonderful, and his handsome face  looked good, even if a somewhat merry smile was ever wont to lurk about  his mouth and in his eyes.    Then came a morning when the abbess found Filippo standing idle, with a  discontented look upon his face. He was gazing at the unfinished  picture, and for a while he did not see that any one had entered the  room.    'Is aught amiss?' asked the gentle voice at his side, and Filippo  turned and saw the abbess.    'Something indeed seems amiss with my five fingers,' said Filippo, with  his quick bright smile. 'Time after time have I tried to paint the face  of the Madonna, and each time I must needs paint it out again.'    Then a happy thought came into his mind.    'I have seen a face sometimes as I passed through the convent garden  which is exactly what I want,' he cried. 'If thou wouldst but let the  maiden sit where I can see her for a few hours each day, I can promise  thee that the Madonna will be finished as thou wouldst wish.'    The abbess stood in deep thought for a few minutes, for she was puzzled  to know what she should do.    'It is the child Lucrezia,' she thought to herself. 'She who was sent  here by her father, the noble Buti of Florence. She is but a novice  still, and there can be no harm in allowing her to lend her fair face  as a model for Our Lady.'    So she told Filippo it should be as he wished.    It was dull in the convent, and Lucrezia was only too pleased to spend  some hours every morning, idly sitting in the great chair, while the  young painter talked to her and told her stories while he painted. She  counted the hours until it was time to go back, and grew happier each  day as the Madonna's face grew more and more beautiful.    Surely there was no one so good or so handsome as this wonderful  artist. Lucrezia could not bear to think how dull her life would be  when he was gone. Then one day, when it happened that the abbess was  called away and they were alone, Filippo told Lucrezia that he loved  her and could not live without her; and although she was frightened at  first, she soon grew happy, and told him that she was ready to go with  him wherever he wished. But what would the good nuns think of it? Would  they ever let her go? No; they must think of some other plan.    To-morrow was the great festa of Prato, when all the nuns walked in  procession to see the holy centola, or girdle, which the Madonna had  given to St. Thomas. Lucrezia must take care to walk on the outside of  the procession, and to watch for a touch upon the arm as she passed.    The festa day dawned bright and clear, and all Prato was early astir.  Procession after procession wound its way to the church where the relic  was to be shown, and the crowd grew denser every moment. Presently came  the nuns of Santa Margherita. A figure in the crowd pressed nearer.  Lucrezia felt a touch upon her arm, and a strong hand clasped hers. The  crowd swayed to and fro, and in an instant the two figures disappeared.  No one noticed that the young novice was gone, and before the nuns  thought of looking for their charge Lucrezia was on her way to  Florence, her horse led by the painter whom she loved, while his good  friend Fra Diamante rode beside her.    Then the storm burst. Lucrezia's father was furious, the good nuns were  dismayed, and every one shook their heads over this last adventure of  the Florentine painter.    But luckily for Filippo, the great Cosimo still stood his friend and  helped him through it all. He it was who begged the Pope to allow Fra  Filippo to marry Lucrezia (for monks, of course, were never allowed to  marry), and the Pope, too, was kind and granted the request, so that  all went well.    Now indeed was Lucrezia as happy as the day was long, and when the  spring returned once more to Florence, a baby Filippo came with the  violets and lilies.    'How wilt thou know us apart if thou callest him Filippo?' asked the  proud father.    'Ah, he is such a little one, dear heart,' Lucrezia answered gaily. 'We  will call him Filippino, and then there can be no mistake.'    There was no more need now to seek for pleasures out of doors. Filippo  painted his pictures and lived his happy home life without seeking any  more adventures. His Madonnas grew ever more beautiful, for they were  all touched with the beauty that shone from Lucrezia's fair face, and  the Infant Christ had ever the smile and the curly golden hair of the  baby Filippino.    And by and by a little daughter came to gladden their hearts, and then  indeed their cup of joy was full.    'What name shall we give the little maid?' said Filippo.    'Methought thou wouldst have it Lucrezia,' answered the mother.    'There is but one Lucrezia in all the world for me,' he said. 'None  other but thee shall bear that name.'    As they talked a knock sounded at the door, and presently the favourite  pupil, Sandro, looked in. There was a shout of joy from little  Filippino, and the young man lifted the child in his arms and smiled  with the look of one who loves children.    'Come, Sandro, and see the little new flower,' said Filippo. 'Is she  not as fair as the roses which thou dost so love to paint?'    Then, as the young man looked with interest at the tiny face, Filippo  clapped him on the shoulder.    'I have it!' he cried. 'She shall be called after thee, Alessandra.  Some day she will be proud to think that she bears thy name.'    For already Filippo knew that this pupil of his would ere long wake the  world to new wonder.    The only clouds that hid the sunshine of Lucrezia's life was when  Filippo was obliged to leave her for a while and paint his pictures in  other towns. She always grew sad when his work in Florence drew to a  close, for she never knew where his next work might lie.    'Well,' said Filippo one night as he returned home and caught up little  Filippino in his arms, 'the picture for the nuns of San Ambrogio is  finished at last! Truly they have saints and angels enough this  time--rows upon rows of sweet faces and white lilies. And the sweetest  face of all is thine, Saint Lucy, kneeling in front with thy hand  beneath the chin of this young cherub.'    'Is it indeed finished so soon?' asked Lucrezia, a wistful note  creeping into her voice.    'Ay, and to-morrow I must away to Spoleto to begin my work at the  Chapel of Our Lady. But look not so sad, dear heart; before three  months are past, by the time the grapes are gathered, I will return.'    But it was sad work parting, though it might only be for three months,  and even her little son could not make his mother smile, though he drew  wonderful pictures for her of birds and beasts, and told her he meant  to be a great painter like his father when he grew up.    Next day Filippo started, and with him went his good friend Fra  Diamante.    'Fare thee well, Filippo. Take good care of him, friend Diamante,'  cried Lucrezia; and she stood watching until their figures disappeared  at the end of the long white road, and then went inside to wait  patiently for their return."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5307"],[0,"The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart — Volume 01 (#8)"],[1,"52.    Vienna, Sept. 15, 1773.    WE are quite well, thank God; on this occasion we have contrived to make  time to write to you, although we have so much business to do. We hope  you also are well. Dr. Niderl's death grieved us very much. I assure you  we cried a good deal, and moaned and groaned. Our kind regards to \"Alle  gute Geister loben Gott den Herrn\" [to all good spirits who praise the  Lord], and to all our friends. We graciously remain    Yours, WOLFGANG.    Given from our capital of Vienna.        The travellers returned home the end of September, for no situation was  to be found in Vienna either; indeed, they did not even give a public  concert there. Wolfgang remained in his native town during the whole of  the ensuing year, writing instrumental and church music. At length he  received a commission from the Elector of Bavaria, Maximilian III., to  write an opera buffa for the Carnival of 1775,--\"La finta Giardiniera.\"        53.    Munich, Dec. 28, 1774.    My Dearest Sister,    I entreat you not to forget, before your journey, [FOOTNOTE: Nannerl had  also the most eager desire to see the new opera, and the father at last  succeeded in getting a lodging for her in the large market place, in the  house of a widow, \"a black-eyed brunette,\" Frau von Durst.] to perform  your promise, that is, to make a certain visit. I have my reasons for  this. Pray present my kind regards in that quarter, but in the most  impressive and tender manner--the most tender; and, oh!----but I need  not be in such anxiety on the subject, for I know my sister and her  peculiarly loving nature, and I feel quite convinced that she will do  all she can to give me pleasure--and from self-interest, too--rather  a spiteful hit that! [Nannerl was considered a little selfish by her  family.]        54.    Munich, Dec. 30, 1774.    I BEG my compliments to Roxalana, who is to drink tea this evening with  the Sultan, All sorts of pretty speeches to Madlle. Mizerl; she must not  doubt my love. I have her constantly before my eyes in her fascinating  neglige. I have seen many pretty girls here, but not one whose beauty  can be compared with hers. Do not forget to bring the variations on  Ekart's menuet d'exaude, and also those on Fischer's minuet. I was at  the theatre last night. The play was \"Der Mode nach der Haushaltung,\"  which was admirably acted. My kind regards to all my friends. I trust  that you will not fail to--Farewell! I hope to see you soon in Munich.  Frau von Durst sends you her remembrances. Is it true that Hagenauer is  become a professor of sculpture in Vienna? Kiss mamma's hand for me,  and now I stop for to-day. Wrap yourself up warmly on your journey, I  entreat, or else you may chance to pass the fourteen days of your visit  in the house, stifling beside a stove, unable once to move. I see the  vivid lightning flash, and fear there soon will be a crash!    Your brother.        55.    To HIS MOTHER.    Munich, Jan. 11, 1775.    WE are all three well, Heaven be praised! I cannot possibly write much,  for I must go forthwith to the rehearsal. Tomorrow the grand rehearsal  takes place, and on the 13th my opera is to be in scena. I am much vexed  that you should cast any slight on Count Seeau [Intendant of the Munich  Theatre], for no one can be more kind or courteous, and he has more good  breeding than many of his degree in Munich. Herr von Molk was in such a  state of wonder and admiration at the opera seria when he heard it, that  we felt quite ashamed of him, for it clearly showed every one that he  had never in his life seen anything but Salzburg and Innspruck. Addio!        56.    To HIS MOTHER.    Munich, Jan. 14, 1775.    GOD be praised! My opera was given yesterday, the 13th, and proved so  successful that I cannot possibly describe all the tumult. In the first  place, the whole theatre was so crammed that many people were obliged  to go away. After each aria there was invariably a tremendous uproar and  clapping of hands, and cries of Viva Maestro! Her Serene Highness the  Electress and the Dowager (who were opposite me) also called out Bravo!  When the opera was over, during the interval when all is usually quiet  till the ballet begins, the applause and shouts of Bravo! were renewed;  sometimes there was a lull, but only to recommence afresh, and so forth.  I afterwards went with papa to a room through which the Elector and  the whole court were to pass. I kissed the hands of the Elector and the  Electress and the other royalties, who were all very gracious. At an  early hour this morning the Prince Bishop of Chiemsee [who had most  probably procured the scrittura for his young friend Wolfgang] sent to  congratulate me that the opera had proved such a brilliant success in  every respect. As to our return home, it is not likely to be soon, nor  should mamma wish it, for she must know well what a good thing it is to  have a little breathing time. We shall come quite soon enough to----.  One most just and undeniable reason is, that my opera is to be given  again on Friday next, and I am very necessary at the performance, or it  might be difficult to recognize it again. There are very odd ways here.  1000 kisses to Miss Bimberl [the dog].    The Archbishop of Salzburg, who was very reluctant to admit the merits  of his Concertmeister, was an involuntary witness of the universal  approbation bestowed on Wolfgang's opera, although he would not go  to hear it himself. On the 18th of January, 1775, Wolfgang added the  following lines to his father's letter:--        57.    MY DEAR SISTER,    [FOOTNOTE: Nannerl had not yet gone home, but was enjoying the Carnival  in various masks.]    How can I help the clock choosing at this moment to strike a quarter  after seven o'clock? It is not papa's fault either. Mamma will hear all  the rest from you. At present there is no fair sailing for me, as  the Archbishop is staying here, though not for long. It is currently  reported that he is to remain till he sets off again! I only regret that  he is not to see the first masked ball.    Your faithful FRANZ v. NASENBLUT.    Milan, May 5, 1756.      Immediately after Ash Wednesday the trio returned to Salzburg, where  Mozart remained uninterruptedly for another year and a half, actively  engaged in the duties of his situation. He wrote the following letter  on the 4th of September, 1776, to the celebrated Pater Martini in  Bologna:--        58.    MOLTO REVDO PADE MAESTRO, PADRONE MIO STIMATISSIMO,--La venerazione,  la stima e il rispetto, che porto verso la di lei degnissima persona mi  spinse di incommodarla colle presente e di mandargli un debole pezzo  di mia musica, rimmettendola alla di lei maestrale giudicatura. Scrissi  l'anno scorso il Carnevale una opera buffa (\"La finta Giardiniera\") a  Monaco in Baviera. Pochi giorni avanti la mia partenza di la desiderava  S. A. Elletorale di sentire qualche mia musica in contrapunto: era  adunque obligato di scriver questo Motetto in fretta per dar tempo  a copiar il spartito per Sua Altezza ed a cavar le parti per poter  produrlo la prossima domenica sotto la Messa grande in tempo  del Offertorio. Carissimo e stimatissimo Sigr. P. Maestro! Lei e  ardentemente pregato di dirmi francamente e senza riserva il di lei  parere. Viviamo in questo mondo per imparare sempre industriosamente, e  per mezzo dei raggionamenti di illuminarsi l'un l'altro e d'affatigarsi  di portar via sempre avanti le scienze e le belle arti. Oh quante e  quante volte desidero d'esser piu vicino per poter parlar e raggionar  con Vostra Paternita molto Revda. Vivo in una paese dove la musica fa  pocchissimo fortuna, benche oltre di quelli che ci hanno abandonati, ne  abbiamo ancora bravissimi professori e particolarmente compositori di  gran fondo, sapere e gusto. Per il teatro stiamo male per mancanza dei  recitanti. Non abbiamo Musici e non gli averemo si facilmente, giache  vogliono esser ben pagati: e la generosita, non e il nostro difetto. Io  mi diverto intanto a scrivere per la camera e per la chiesa: e ne  son quivi altri due bravissimi contrapuntisti, cioe il Sgr. Haydn e  Adlgasser. Il mio padre e maestro della chiesa Metropolitana, che mi da  l'occasione di scrivere per la chiesa, quanto che ne voglio. Per altro  il mio padre gia 36 anni in servizio di questa Corte e sapendo, che  questo Arcivescovo non puo e non vuol vedere gente avanzata in eta, non  lo se ne prende a core, si e messo alla letteratura per altro gia suo  studio favorito. La nostra musica di chiesa e assai differente di quella  d'Italia e sempre piu, che una Messa con tutto il Kyrie, Gloria, Credo,  la Sonata all' Epistola, l'Offertorio osia Motetto, Sanctus ed Agnus  Dei, ed anche la piu solenne, quando dice la Messa il Principe stesso,  non ha da durare che al piu longo 3 quarti d'ora. Ci vuole un studio  particolare per queste sorte di compositione, e che deve pero essere una  Messa con tutti stromenti--Trombe di guerra, Tympani ecc. Ah! che  siamo si lontani Carissmo Sgr. P. Maestro, quante cose che avrai a  dirgli!--Reverisco devotamente tutti i Sgri. Filarmonici: mi raccommando  via sempre nelle grazie di lei e non cesso d'affligermi nel vedermi  lontano dalla persona del mondo che maggiormente amo, venero e stimo, e  di cui inviolabilmente mi protesto di V.
