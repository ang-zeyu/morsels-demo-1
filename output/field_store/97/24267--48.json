Every time Hill awoke during  the night he would burst out laughing while Benson would hurl a few  cuss words at him.    The next day we brought in the skin and saddles of the other bear,  leaving the fore quarters for fox and marten bait.    The rain now being about over with and the ground and leaves  thoroughly soaked, it was a good time for still hunting deer, so we  were all out early the next morning. We started out together and soon  became separated and it so happened that I was the only one to get a  deer during the day. When I got to camp I found Benson was not in  yet, so I did not tell that I had killed a deer, but thought I would  wait until Benson came in and see what luck he had. If he had not  killed anything I would give him the hint and let him have the credit  of killing the deer that I got as a sort of off-set on Hill on the  bear hunt. I stayed outside gathering dry limbs for wood until I saw  Benson coming and I planned to meet him before Hill got to talk to  him. I learned that Benson had not killed anything, so I told him  where I had killed the deer and that if he cared to he could claim  the deer as his game. Benson was much pleased with the idea and as I  had told him just where I had killed the deer it was easy for Benson  to explain to Hill where the deer was shot. Hill did not believe that  Benson had killed a deer and said he would not believe he (Benson)  had killed one if he did not know that he had been alone and anyway  he must see the deer before he would believe it. I took the first  opportunity when Hill was out to tell Benson which way to go so that  he would be sure to find the deer and the next morning the boys went  out and brought in the deer while I went to look after some traps.  The boys stayed a day or two longer and then went home declaring that  they had had the best hunt of their lives.    I will now tell of some of my hunting and trapping with Mr. Nelson  and my first experience with a big cat. About 1860, when I was a mere  chunk of a boy, a man by the name of Perry Holman was camping on the  extreme headwaters of Pine Creek, hunting and trapping. Early one  morning Mr. Holman came out of the woods after groceries and other  necessaries. On his way out he saw where a small bear had crossed the  road just at the top of the hill on the old Jersey Shore turnpike and  about five miles from Mr. Nelson's place. Mr. Nelson at that time  always kept one or two good bear dogs. Mr. Holman told Mr. Nelson of  the bear's track and said that the bear had gone into a laurel patch  on the west side of the road and that the track was very fresh. He  thought if Mr. Nelson would take his dogs and go out that he could  get the bear without much trouble as he believed the bear would still  be in the laurels close to the road.    Mr. Nelson told Mr. Holman to get his groceries while he would come  to see if I would go along to look after the team while Mr. Nelson  and Mr. Holman went into the laurels after the bear. Of course, I was  ready for anything that had hunt in it. The sleighing was good and  Mr. Nelson was soon ready, taking his dogs into the sleigh so that  they would not break off on the track of a deer or some other animal.    When we came to where Mr. Holman saw the bear or cub, Mr. Nelson, or  Uncle as we always called him, said to Mr. Holman before he got out  of the sleigh:    \"Perry, that is no cub's track; that is a big cat and I think we will  find him in the laurel patch.\"    Uncle told me to stay with the team and that they would not be gone  long; that if the track led off he would come back to the sleigh and  I could go back with the team and he would go to Mr. Holman's camp  and stay over night and come home the next day.    The dogs were anxious to take the trail, but Uncle held them in to  the laurels. They had not been gone more than ten minutes when the  dogs began to give tongue like mischief. I could see that the dogs  were coming towards the road and in about a minute saw the biggest  cat that I had ever seen at that time, shinning up a large tree that  was not further than fifty yards from the sleigh. The dogs were soon  at the tree barking their best and in a few minutes I heard the crack  of a gun and the big cat seemed to fly out into the air. I could hear  the cat go threshing down through the limbs on the trees and the dogs  doubled their howling and I could hear the men laugh. I called to the  men to see if they got the cat. Uncle told me to watch the horses and  they would soon be there, and they were soon in sight dragging a  large panther instead of either a cub or cat. Uncle drove down to  where Holman's path left the road to go down to his camp and we then  drove back home. Uncle was greatly pleased over Perry's cat hunt as  Mr. Nelson called it.    * * *    In or about the year '67 or '68, Uncle Horatio Nelson, whom I have  spoken of before, had for years been accustomed to going to Edgecomb  Place, later known as Cherry Springs, to hunt and trap. Wolves were  then more plentiful than foxes are at the present time.    I will explain that Cherry Springs was simply a farm house built of  logs. This house was located about half way through, or in the center  of a dense forest of about twenty miles square. The Jersey Shore  turnpike ran through this vast forest and the stage or any traveler  going through this region were obliged to stop at this house to feed  at noon, or to stop over night, this being the only house on the  road.    From where this house was located there was easy access to the waters  of Pine Creek, which flowed east, to the waters of the Cross Fork of  Kettle Creek, which flowed south and to the waters of the East Fork  of the Sinnamahoning which flowed west. There was no one living on  any of these streams for many miles. This was the point where Mr.  Nelson, or Uncle, as I shall call him, hunted for many years.    At the time I am writing of, it had been a noted place for many  hunters to stop from all parts of the country. There were almost too  many hunters stopping at Cherry Spring to suit Uncle as he was  getting pretty well along in years and did not like so much company.  I had been camping a greater part of the time for several seasons  about five miles north of Cherry Springs and one day Uncle said, if I  cared to, he would go on to Crossfork and build a cabin and we would  hunt and trap, more particularly trap. This was satisfactory to me  although I had a good camp where I was trapping and in a fairly good  locality for game, but the Crossfork country was a little farther in  the tall timber so I thought that the change might be a good thing.    About the first of October we took a team, went into the woods and  cut out a sort of a turkey trail from the wagon road down to Boon  Road Hollow to the Hog's Back branch of the Crossfork, where we  selected a sight for the camp. We felled a large hemlock tree and cut  off four logs of suitable length to make the body of the camp about  ten by twelve feet inside. We worked them around in shape fitting the  two shorter logs in between the ends of the two longer logs; then  placing rafters at about half pitch, put on the covering, chinked and  calked all the cracks and built a chimney of stones, sticks and clay  and put in a door.    We were now ready for the trap line. We set the bear traps on  different ridges where we thought would be the most likely places for  bears to travel. Then we put out two lines of deadfalls for marten.  We then took the different branches and spring runs, building more  deadfalls for mink and coons, setting the greater part of our steel  traps for foxes. After all the steel traps but three or four were  set, Uncle said that if I would go down the creek and set the balance  of the steel traps, he would go and look after the first of the bear  traps that we had set. I set the steel traps for foxes and built one  or two more deadfalls farther down the creek. I think that I found a  mink and one coon in the deadfalls that we had set in that section.    I got to camp about dark but Uncle had not come yet. I hustled supper  to have it ready when he came, but when supper was ready I could  neither see nor hear anything of him. After waiting some time I  concluded to eat and then if he did not come I would go in the  direction he had taken as I now suspected that he had gotten a bear  and was bringing in what he could carry and that I would meet him and  help him in with his load. Before I started out to see if I could  find him I gave several long and loud \"coohoopes,\" but got no answer.  I concluded I would fire a couple of gunshots and see if I could get  an answer, but got no reply save the hoot of an owl.    I now began to feel alarmed, fearing that some misfortune had  happened Uncle as he knew every rod of the ground in that section. I  had no lantern so I made two good torches from fat pine, having a  good supply in camp, and followed the stream until I came to a little  draw where we had a bear trap set. This trap had not been disturbed,  so I climbed the hill to the top of the ridge when I fired two more  gunshots but still got no response. I was now thoroughly alarmed as I  knew that a gunshot on the still night air could be heard a long ways  from the high ridge I was on.    With the aid of another torch I hurried on to the next bear trap and  upon arriving at the second trap I saw that the clog was gone and  that there was a trail leading off through the leaves and  undergrowth. I now knew that it was something in connection with the  bear that was detaining Uncle, but what it was I could not tell.    I followed the trail with the aid of the torch for fifty yards when I  came to a fallen tree that lay up about a foot from the ground. Here  I found the clog that had been fastened to the trap. I could see that  the trap ring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#8)"],[1,"ancers. They are full of character. They seem to breathe out the  essence of a vanished domesticity. Colossal are the statues of the king,  solid, powerful, and tremendous, boldly facing the world with the calm  of one who was thought, and possibly thought himself, to be not much  less than a deity. And upon each pedestal, shrinking delicately back,  was once a little wife. Some little wives are left. They are delicious  in their modesty. Each stands away from the king, shyly, respectfully.  Each is so small as to be below his down-stretched arm. Each, with a  surely furtive gesture, reaches out her right hand, and attains the  swelling calf of her noble husband's leg. Plump are their little faces,  but not bad-looking. One cannot pity the king. Nor does one pity them.  For these were not \"Les desenchantees,\" the restless, sad-hearted women  of an Eastern world that knows too much. Their longings surely cannot  have been very great. Their world was probably bounded by the calf of  Rameses's leg. That was \"the far horizon\" of the little plump-faced  wives.    The happy dancers and the humble wives, they always come before me with  the temple of Luxor--joy and discretion side by side. And with them, to  my ears, the two voices seem to come, muezzin and angelus bell, mingling  not in war, but peace. When I think of this temple, I think of its joy  and peace far less than of its majesty.    And yet it is majestic. Look at it, as I have often done, toward  sunset from the western bank of the Nile, or climb the mound beyond its  northern end, where stands the grand entrance, and you realize at once  its nobility and solemn splendor. From the _Loulia's_ deck it was a  procession of great columns; that was all. But the decorative effect of  these columns, soaring above the river and its vivid life, is fine.    By day all is turmoil on the river-bank. Barges are unloading, steamers  are arriving, and throngs of donkey-boys and dragomans go down in  haste to meet them. Servants run to and fro on errands from the many  dahabiyehs. Bathers leap into the brown waters. The native craft pass by  with their enormous sails outspread to catch the wind, bearing serried  mobs of men, and black-robed women, and laughing, singing children. The  boatmen of the hotels sing monotonously as they lounge in the big, white  boats waiting for travellers to Medinet-Abu, to the Ramesseum, to Kurna,  and the tombs. And just above them rise the long lines of columns,  ancient, tranquil, and remote--infinitely remote, for all their  nearness, casting down upon the sunlit gaiety the long shadow of the  past.    From the edge of the mound where stands the native village the effect  of the temple is much less decorative, but its detailed grandeur can be  better grasped from there; for from there one sees the great towers of  the propylon, two rows of mighty columns, the red granite Obelisk of  Rameses the great, and the black granite statues of the king. On the  right of the entrance a giant stands, on the left one is seated, and a  little farther away a third emerges from the ground, which reaches to  its mighty breast.    And there the children play perpetually. And there the Egyptians sing  their serenades, making the pipes wail and striking the derabukkeh; and  there the women gossip and twitter like the birds. And the buffalo comes  to take his sun-bath; and the goats and the curly, brown sheep pass in  sprightly and calm processions. The obelisk there, like its brother in  Paris, presides over a cheerfulness of life; but it is a life that seems  akin to it, not alien from it. And the king watches the simplicity of  this keen existence of Egypt of to-day far up the Nile with a calm that  one does not fear may be broken by unsympathetic outrage, or by any  vision of too perpetual foreign life. For the tourists each year are but  an episode in Upper Egypt. Still the shadoof-man sings his ancient song,  violent and pathetic, bold as the burning sun-rays. Still the fellaheen  plough with the camel yoked with the ox. Still the women are covered  with protective amulets and hold their black draperies in their mouths.  The intimate life of the Nile remains the same. And that life obelisk  and king have known for how many, many years!    And so I love to think of this intimacy of life about the temple of the  happy dancers and the humble little wives, and it seems to me to strike  the keynote of the golden coziness of Luxor.          IX    COLOSSI OF MEMNON    Nevertheless, sometimes one likes to escape from the thing one loves,  and there are hours when the gay voices of Luxor fatigue the ears, when  one desires a great calm. Then there are silent voices that summon  one across the river, when the dawn is breaking over the hills of  the Arabian desert, or when the sun is declining toward the Libyan  mountains--voices issuing from lips of stone, from the twilight of  sanctuaries, from the depths of rock-hewn tombs.    The peace of the plain of Thebes in the early morning is very rare and  very exquisite. It is not the peace of the desert, but rather, perhaps,  the peace of the prairie--an atmosphere tender, delicately thrilling,  softly bright, hopeful in its gleaming calm. Often and often have I left  the _Loulia_ very early moored against the long sand islet that faces  Luxor when the Nile has not subsided, I have rowed across the quiet  water that divided me from the western bank, and, with a happy heart, I  have entered into the lovely peace of the great spaces that stretch from  the Colossi of Memnon to the Nile, to the mountains, southward toward  Armant, northward to Kerekten, to Danfik, to Gueziret-Meteira. Think of  the color of young clover, of young barley, of young wheat; think of  the timbre of the reed flute's voice, thin, clear, and frail with the  frailty of dewdrops; think of the torrents of spring rushing through the  veins of a great, wide land, and growing almost still at last on their  journey. Spring, you will say, perhaps, and high Nile not yet subsided!  But Egypt is the favored land of a spring that is already alert at the  end of November, and in December is pushing forth its green. The Nile  has sunk away from the feet of the Colossi that it has bathed through  many days. It has freed the plain to the fellaheen, though still  it keeps my island in its clasp. And Hapi, or Kam-wra, the \"Great  Extender,\" and Ra, have made this wonderful spring to bloom on the dark  earth before the Christian's Christmas.    What a pastoral it is, this plain of Thebes, in the dawn of day! Think  of the reed flute, I have said, not because you will hear it, as you  ride toward the mountains, but because its voice would be utterly in  place here, in this arcady of Egypt, playing no tarantella, but one of  those songs, half bird-like, and half sadly, mysteriously human, which  come from the soul of the East. Instead of it, you may catch distant  cries from the bank of the river, where the shadoof-man toils, lifting  ever the water and his voice, the one to earth, the other, it seems, to  sky; and the creaking lay of the water-wheel, which pervades Upper Egypt  like an atmosphere, and which, though perhaps at first it irritates, at  last seems to you the sound of the soul of the river, of the sunshine,  and the soil.    Much of the land looks painted. So flat is it, so young are the growing  crops, that they are like a coating of green paint spread over a mighty  canvas. But the doura rises higher than the heads of the naked children  who stand among it to watch you canter past. And in the far distance  you see dim groups of trees--sycamores and acacias, tamarisks and palms.  Beyond them is the very heart of this \"land of sand and ruins and gold\";  Medinet-Abu, the Ramesseum, Deir-el Medinet, Kurna, Deir-el-Bahari, the  tombs of the kings, the tombs of the queens and of the princes. In the  strip of bare land at the foot of those hard, and yet poetic mountains,  have been dug up treasures the fame of which has gone to the ends of the  world. But this plain, where the fellaheen are stooping to the soil, and  the women are carrying the water-jars, and the children are playing in  the doura, and the oxen and the camels are working with ploughs that  look like relics of far-off days, is the possession of the two great  presiding beings whom you see from an enormous distance, the Colossi of  Memnon. Amenhotep III. put them where they are. So we are told. But in  this early morning it is not possible to think of them as being brought  to any place. Seated, the one beside the other, facing the Nile and the  home of the rising sun, their immense aspect of patience suggests will,  calmly, steadily exercised, suggests choice; that, for some reason, as  yet unknown, they chose to come to this plain, that they choose solemnly  to remain there, waiting, while the harvests grow and are gathered about  their feet, while the Nile rises and subsides, while the years and  the generations come, like the harvests, and are stored away in the  granaries of the past. Their calm broods over this plain, gives to it  a personal atmosphere which sets it quite apart from every other flat  space of the world. There is no place that I know on the earth which has  the peculiar, bright, ineffable calm of the plain of these Colossi. It  takes you into its breast, and you lie there in the growing sunshine  almost as if you were a child laid in the lap of one of them. That  legend of the singing at dawn of the \"vocal Memnon,\" how could it have  arisen? How could such calmness sing, such patience ever find a voice?  Unlike the Sphinx, which becomes ever more impressive as you draw near  to it, and is most impressive when you sit almost at its feet, the  Colossi lose in personality as you approach them and can see how they  have been defaced.    From afar one feels their minds, their strange, unearthly temperaments  commanding this pastoral. When you are beside them, this feeling"]]]
