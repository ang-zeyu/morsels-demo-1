What amazes me most is that so old a man as  Holzbauer should have so much spirit,--it is incredible, the  amount of fire in his music.\"    (Mannheim, November 14, 1777, to his father. Ignaz Holzbauer was  born in Vienna, in 1711, and died as chapelmaster in Mannheim, on  April 7, 1793. During the last years of his life he was totally  deaf. The music referred to was the setting of the first great  German Singspiel, \"Gunther von Schwarzburg.\")    82. \"There is much that is pretty in many of Martini's things,  but in ten years nobody will notice them.\"    (Reported by Nissen. Martini lived in Bologna from 1706 to 1784;  there Mozart learned to know and admire him. In 1776 he wrote a  letter to him in which he said that of all people in the world he  \"loved, honored and valued\" him most.)    83. \"For those who seek only light entertainment in music nobody  better can be recommended than Paisiello.\"    (Reported by Nissen. Paisiello was born in Taranto in 1741,  composed over a hundred operas which, like his church music, won  much applause. He died in Naples in 1816. Mozart considered his  music \"transparent.\")    84. \"Jomelli has his genre in which he shines, and we must  abandon the thought of supplanting him in that field in the  judgment of the knowing. But he ought not to have abandoned his  field to compose church music in the old style, for instance.\"    (Reported by Nissen. Jomelli was born in 1714 near Naples, where  he died in 1774. He was greatly admired as a composer of operas  and church music. He was Court Chapelmaster in Stuttgart from  1753 to 1769.)    85. \"Wait till you know how many of his works we have in Vienna!  When I get back home I shall diligently study his church music,  and I hope to learn a great deal from it.\"    (A remark made in Leipsic when somebody spoke slightingly of the  music of Gassmann, an Imperial Court Chapelmaster in Vienna, and  much respected by Maria Theresa and Joseph.)    86. \"The fact that Gatti, the ass, begged the Archbishop for  permission to compose a serenade shows his worthiness to wear the  title, which I make no doubt he deserves also for his musical  learning.\"    (Vienna, October 12, 1782, to his father. Gatti was Cathedral  Chapelmaster in Salzburg.)    87. \"What we should like to have, dear father, is some of your  best church pieces; for we love to entertain ourselves with all  manner of masters, ancient and modern. Therefore I beg of you  send us something of yours as soon as possible.\"    (Vienna, March 29, 1783, to his father, Leopold Mozart in  Salzburg, himself a capable composer.)    88. \"In a sense Vogler is nothing but a wizard. As soon as he  attempts to play something majestic he becomes dry, and you are  glad that he, too, feels bored and makes a quick ending. But what  follows?--unintelligible slip-slop. I listened to him from a  distance. Afterward he began a fugue with six notes on the same  tone, and Presto! Then I went up to him. As a matter of fact I  would rather watch him than hear him.\"    (Mannheim, December 18, 1777, to his father. Abbe Vogler was  trying the new organ in the Lutheran church at Mannheim. Vogler  lived from 1749 to 1814, and was the teacher of Karl Maria von  Weber (who esteemed him highly) and Meyerbeer. Mozart's criticism  seems unduly severe.)    89. \"I was at mass, a brand new composition by Vogler. I had  already been at the rehearsal day before yesterday afternoon, but  went away after the Kyrie. In all my life I have heard nothing like  this. Frequently everything is out of tune. He goes from key to key  as if he wanted to drag one along by the hair of the head, not in  an interesting manner which might be worth while, but bluntly and  rudely. As to the manner in which he develops his ideas I shall say  nothing; but this I will say that it is impossible for a mass by  Vogler to please any composer worthy of the name. Briefly, I hear a  theme which is not bad; does it long remain not bad think you? will  it not soon become beautiful? Heaven forefend! It grows worse and  worse in a two-fold or three-fold manner; for instance scarcely is  it begun before something else enters and spoils it; or he makes so  unnatural a close that it can not remain good; or it is misplaced;  or, finally, it is ruined by the orchestration. That's Vogler's  music.\"    (Mannheim, November 20, 1777, to his father.)    90. \"Clementi plays well so far as execution with the right hand  is concerned; his forte is passages in thirds. Aside from this he  hasn't a pennyworth of feeling or taste; in a word he is a mere  mechanician.\"    (Vienna, January 12, 1782, to his father. Four days later Mozart  expressed the same opinion of Muzio Clementi, who is still in  good repute, after having met him in competition before the  emperor. \"Clementi preluded and played a sonata; then the Emperor  said to me, 'Allons, go ahead.' I preluded and played some  variations.\")    91. \"Now I must say a few words to my sister about the Clementi  sonatas. Every one who plays or hears them will feel for himself  that as compositions they do not signify. There are in them no  remarkable or striking passages, with the exception of those in  sixths and octaves, and I beg my sister not to devote too much  time to these lest she spoil her quiet and steady hand and make  it lose its natural lightness, suppleness and fluent rapidity.  What, after all, is the use? She is expected to play the sixths  and octaves with the greatest velocity (which no man will  accomplish, not even Clementi), and if she tries she will produce  a frightful zig-zag, and nothing more. Clementi is a Ciarlatano  like all Italians. He writes upon a sonata Presto, or even  Prestissimo and alla breve, and plays it Allegro in 4-4 time. I  know it because I have heard him! What he does well is his  passages in thirds; but he perspired over these day and night in  London. Aside from this he has nothing,--absolutely nothing; not  excellence in reading, nor taste, nor sentiment.\"    (Vienna, June 7, 1783, to his father and sister.)    92. \"Handel knows better than any of us what will make an effect;  when he chooses he strikes like a thunderbolt; even if he is  often prosy, after the manner of his time, there is always  something in his music.\"    (Mozart valued Handel most highly. He knew his masterpieces by  heart--not only the choruses but also many arias. [Reported by  Rochlitz. H.E.K.])    93. \"Apropos, I intended, while asking you to send back the  rondo, to send me also the six fugues by Handel and the toccatas  and fugues by Eberlin. I go every Sunday to Baron von Swieten's,  and there nothing is played except Handel and Bach. I am making a  collection of the fugues,--those of Sebastian as well as of  Emanuel and Friedemann Bach; also of Handel's, and here the six  are lacking. Besides I want to let the baron hear those of  Eberlin. In all likelihood you know that the English Bach is  dead; a pity for the world of music.\"    (Vienna, April 10, 1782, to his father. Johann Ernst Eberlin  (Eberle), born in 1702, died in 1762 as archiepiscopal  chapelmaster in Salzburg. Many of his unpublished works are  preserved in Berlin. The \"English\" Bach was Johann Christian, son  of the great Johann Sebastian. As a child Mozart made his  acquaintance in London.)    94. \"I shall be glad if papa has not yet had the works of Eberlin  copied, for I have gotten them meanwhile, and discovered,--for I  could not remember,--that they are too trivial and surely do not  deserve a place among those of Bach and Handel. All respect to  his four-part writing, but his clavier fugues are nothing but  long-drawn-out versetti.\"    (Vienna, April 29, 1782, to his sister Nannerl.)    95. \"Johann Christian Bach has been here (Paris) for a fortnight.  He is to write a French opera, and is come only to hear the  singers, whereupon he will go to London, write the opera, and  come back to put it on the stage. You can easily imagine his  delight and mine when we met again. Perhaps his delight was not  altogether sincere, but one must admit that he is an honorable  man and does justice to all. I love him, as you know, with all my  heart, and respect him; as for him, one thing is certain, that to  my face and to others, he really praised me, not extravagantly,  like some, but seriously and in earnest.\"    (St. Germain, August 27, 1778, to his father. Johann Christian  Bach was the second son of Johann Sebastian, and born in 1735.  He lived in London where little Wolfgang learned to know him in  1764. Bach took the precocious boy on his knee and the two played  on the harpsichord. [Bach was Music Master to the Queen. \"He  liked to play with the boy,\" says Jahn; \"took him upon his knee  and went through a sonata with him, each in turn playing a  measure with such precision that no one would have suspected  two performers. He began a fugue, which Wolfgang took up and  completed when Bach broke off.\" H.E.K.])    96. \"Bach is the father, we are the youngsters. Those of us who  can do a decent thing learned how from him; and whoever will not  admit it is a...\"    (A remark made at a gathering in Leipsic. The Bach referred to is  Phillip Emanuel Bach, who died in 1788.)    97. \"Here, at last, is something from which one can learn!\"    (Mozart's ejaculation when he heard Bach's motet for double  chorus, \"Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied,\" at Leipsic in 1789.  Rochlitz relates: \"Scarcely had the choir sung a couple of  measures when Mozart started. After a few more measures he cried  out: 'What is that?' and now his whole soul seemed to be in his  ears.\")    98. \"Melt us two together, and we will fall far short of making a  Haydn.\"    (Said to the pianist Leopold Kozeluch who had triumphantly  pointed out a few slips due to carelessness in Haydn's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4060"],[0,"The Renaissance: studies in art and poetry (#8)"],[1,"Renaissance fulfils.  And yet to read a page of one of Pico's  forgotten books is like a glance into one of those ancient  sepulchres, upon which the wanderer in classical lands has  sometimes stumbled, with the old disused ornaments and  furniture of a world wholly unlike ours still fresh in them.  That  whole conception of nature is so different from our own.  For  Pico the world is a limited place, bounded by actual crystal walls,  and a material firmament; it is like a painted toy, like that map or  system of the world, held, as a great target or shield, in the hands  of the creative Logos, by whom the Father made all things, in one  of the earlier frescoes of the Campo Santo at Pisa.  How different  from this childish dream is our own conception of nature, with its  unlimited space, its innumerable suns, and the earth but a mote in  the beam; how different the strange new awe, or superstition,  with which it fills our minds!  \"The silence of those infinite  spaces,\" [42] says Pascal, contemplating a starlight night, the  silence of those infinite spaces terrifies me\":-- Le silence éternel de  ces espaces infinis m'effraie.    He was already almost wearied out when he came to Florence.  He had loved much and been beloved by women, \"wandering  over the crooked hills of delicious pleasure\"; but their reign over  him was over, and long before Savonarola's famous \"bonfire of  vanities,\" he had destroyed those love-songs in the vulgar tongue,  which would have been so great a relief to us, after the scholastic  prolixity of his Latin writings.  It was in another spirit that he  composed a Platonic commentary, the only work of his in Italian  which has come down to us, on the \"Song of Divine Love\"--  secondo la mente ed opinione dei Platonici--\"according to the  mind and opinion of the Platonists,\" by his friend Hieronymo  Beniveni, in which, with an ambitious array of every sort of  learning, and a profusion of imagery borrowed indifferently from  the astrologers, the Cabala, and Homer, and Scripture, and  Dionysius the Areopagite, he attempts to define the stages by  which the soul passes from the earthly to the unseen beauty.  A  change indeed had passed over him, as if the chilling touch of the  abstract and disembodied beauty Platonists profess to long for  were already upon him.  Some sense of this, perhaps, coupled  with that over-brightness which in the popular imagination  always betokens an early [43] death, made Camilla Rucellai, one  of those prophetic women whom the preaching of Savonarola had  raised up in Florence, declare, seeing him for the first time, that  he would depart in the time of lilies--prematurely, that is, like the  field-flowers which are withered by the scorching sun almost as  soon as they are sprung up.  He now wrote down those thoughts  on the religious life which Sir Thomas More turned into English,  and which another English translator thought worthy to be added  to the books of the Imitation.  \"It is not hard to know God,  provided one will not force oneself to define Him\":--has been  thought a great saying of Joubert's.  \"Love God,\" Pico writes to  Angelo Politian, \"we rather may, than either know Him, or by  speech utter Him.  And yet had men liefer by knowledge never  find that which they seek, than by love possess that thing, which  also without love were in vain found.\"    Yet he who had this fine touch for spiritual things did not--and in  this is the enduring interest of his story--even after his  conversion, forget the old gods.  He is one of the last who  seriously and sincerely entertained the claim on men's faith of the  pagan religions; he is anxious to ascertain the true significance of  the obscurest legend, the lightest tradition concerning them.  With many thoughts and many influences which led him in that  direction, [44] he did not become a monk; only he became  gentle and patient in disputation; retaining \"somewhat of the old  plenty, in dainty viand and silver vessel,\" he gave over the  greater part of his property to his friend, the mystical poet  Beniveni, to be spent by him in works of charity, chiefly in the  sweet charity of providing marriage-dowries for the peasant girls  of Florence.  His end came in 1494, when, amid the prayers and  sacraments of Savonarola, he died of fever, on the very day on  which Charles the Eighth entered Florence, the seventeenth of  November, yet in the time of lilies--the lilies of the shield of  France, as the people now said, remembering Camilla's  prophecy.  He was buried in the conventual church of Saint  Mark, in the hood and white frock of the Dominican order.    It is because the life of Pico, thus lying down to rest in the  Dominican habit, yet amid thoughts of the older gods, himself  like one of those comely divinities, reconciled indeed to the new  religion, but still with a tenderness for the earlier life, and  desirous literally to \"bind the ages each to each by natural piety\"-  -it is because this life is so perfect a parallel to the attempt made  in his writings to reconcile Christianity with the ideas of  paganism, that Pico, in spite of the scholastic character of those  writings, is really interesting.  Thus, in the Heptaplus, or  Discourse on the Seven Days of the Creation, he endeavours to  reconcile the [45] accounts which pagan philosophy had given of  the origin of the world with the account given in the books of  Moses--the Timaeus of Plato with the book of Genesis.  The  Heptaplus is dedicated to Lorenzo the Magnificent, whose  interest, the preface tells us, in the secret wisdom of Moses is  well known.  If Moses seems in his writings simple and even  popular, rather than either a philosopher or a theologian, that is  because it was an institution with the ancient philosophers, either  not to speak of divine things at all, or to speak of them  dissemblingly: hence their doctrines were called mysteries.  Taught by them, Pythagoras became so great a \"master of  silence,\" and wrote almost nothing, thus hiding the words of God  in his heart, and speaking wisdom only among the perfect.  In  explaining the harmony between Plato and Moses, Pico lays hold  on every sort of figure and analogy, on the double meanings of  words, the symbols of the Jewish ritual, the secondary meanings  of obscure stories in the later Greek mythologists.  Everywhere  there is an unbroken system of correspondences.  Every object in  the terrestrial world is an analogue, a symbol or counterpart, of  some higher reality in the starry heavens, and this again of some  law of the angelic life in the world beyond the stars.  There is the  element of fire in the material world; the sun is the fire of heaven;  and in the super-celestial world there is the fire of [46] the  seraphic intelligence.  \"But behold how they differ!  The  elementary fire burns, the heavenly fire vivifies, the super-  celestial fire loves.\"  In this way, every natural object, every  combination of natural forces, every accident in the lives of men,  is filled with higher meanings.  Omens, prophecies, supernatural  coincidences, accompany Pico himself all through life.  There are  oracles in every tree and mountain-top, and a significance in  every accidental combination of the events of life.    This constant tendency to symbolism and imagery gives Pico's  work a figured style, by which it has some real resemblance to  Plato's, and he differs from other mystical writers of his time by  a genuine desire to know his authorities at first hand.  He reads  Plato in Greek, Moses in Hebrew, and by this his work really  belongs to the higher culture.  Above all, we have a constant  sense in reading him, that his thoughts, however little their  positive value may be, are connected with springs beneath them  of deep and passionate emotion; and when he explains the grades  or steps by which the soul passes from the love of a physical  object to the love of unseen beauty, and unfolds the analogies  between this process and other movements upward of human  thought, there is a glow and vehemence in his words which  remind one of the manner in which his own brief existence  flamed itself away.    I said that the Renaissance of the fifteenth [47] century was, in  many things, great rather by what it designed or aspired to do,  than by what it actually achieved.  It remained for a later age to  conceive the true method of effecting a scientific reconciliation  of Christian sentiment with the imagery, the legends, the theories  about the world, of pagan poetry and philosophy.  For that age  the only possible reconciliation was an imaginative one, and  resulted from the efforts of artists, trained in Christian schools, to  handle pagan subjects; and of this artistic reconciliation work like  Pico's was but the feebler counterpart.  Whatever philosophers  had to say on one side or the other, whether they  were successful or not in their attempts to reconcile the old to the  new, and to justify the expenditure of so much care and thought  on the dreams of a dead faith, the imagery of the Greek religion,  the direct charm of its story, were by artists valued and cultivated  for their own sake.  Hence a new sort of mythology, with a tone  and qualities of its own.  When the ship-load of sacred earth from  the soil of Jerusalem was mingled with the common clay in the  Campo Santo at Pisa, a new flower grew up from it, unlike any  flower men had seen before, the anemone with its concentric  rings of strangely blended colour, still to be found by those who  search long enough for it, in the long grass of the Maremma.  Just  such a strange flower was that mythology of the Italian  Renaissance, which grew up from the mixture of two traditions,  two [48] sentiments, the sacred and the profane.  Classical story  was regarded as so much imaginative material to be received and  assimilated.  It did not come into men's minds to ask curiously of  science, concerning the origin of such"]]]
