When I got among  them, raging like a mad bull, I flung four or five to the earth, and  fell down with them myself, continually aiming my dagger now at one and  now at another. Those who remained upright plied both hands with all  their force, giving it me with hammers, cudgels, and anvil; but inasmuch  as God does sometime mercifully intervene, He so ordered that neither  they nor I did any harm to one another. I only lost my cap, on which my  adversaries seized, though they had run away from it before, and struck  at it with all their weapons. Afterwards, they searched among their dead  and wounded, and saw that not a single man was injured.    Note 1. Cellini calls these magistrates 'arronzinati cappuccetti,' a  term corresponding to our Roundheads. The democratic or anti-Medicean  party in Florence at that time, who adhered to the republican principles  of Fra Girolamo Savonarola, distinguished themselves by wearing the long  tails of their hoods twisted up and turned round their heads. Cellini  shows his Medicean sympathies by using this contemptuous term, and by  the honourable mention he makes of Prinzivalle della Stufa    Note 2. A convent of closely immured nuns.    Note 3. The word I have translated 'massacred' above is 'assassinato.'  It occurs frequently in Italian of this period, and indicates the  extremity of wrong and outrage.    XVIII    I WENT off in the direction of Santa Maria Novella, and stumbling up  against Fra Alessio Strozzi, whom by the way I did not know, I entreated  this good friar for the love of God to save my life, since I had  committed a great fault. He told me to have no fear; for had I done  every sin in the world, I was yet in perfect safety in his little cell.    After about an hour, the Eight, in an extraordinary meeting, caused one  of the most dreadful bans which ever were heard of to be published  against me, announcing heavy penalties against who should harbour me or  know where I was, without regard to place or to the quality of my  protector. My poor afflicted father went to the Eight, threw himself  upon his knees, and prayed for mercy for his unfortunate young son.  Thereupon one of those Radical fellows, shaking the crest of his twisted  hood, stood up and addressed my father with these insulting words: [1]  Get up from there, and begone at once, for to-morrow we shall send your  son into the country with the lances. [2] My poor father had still the  spirit to answer: What God shall have ordained, that will you do, and  not a jot or little more. Whereto the same man replied that for certain  God had ordained as he had spoken. My father said: The thought consoles  me that you do not know for certain; and quitting their presence, he  came to visit me, together with a young man of my own age, called Pierro  di Giovanni Landi-we loved one another as though we had been brothers.    Under his mantle the lad carried a first-rate sword and a splendid coat  of mail; and when they found me, my brave father told me what had  happened, and what the magistrates had said to him. Then he kissed me on  the forehead and both eyes, and gave me his hearty blessing, saying:  May the power of goodness of God be your protection; and reaching me  the sword and armour, he helped me with his own hands to put them on.  Afterwards he added: Oh, my good son, with these arms in thy hand thou  shalt either live or die. Pier Landi, who was present, kept shedding  tears; and when he had given me ten golden crowns, I bade him remove a  few hairs from my chin, which were the first down of my manhood. Frate  Alessio disguised me like a friar and gave me a lay brother to go with  me. [3] Quitting the convent, and issuing from the city by the gate of  Prato, I went along the walls as far as the Piazza di San Gallo. Then I  ascended the slope of Montui, and in one of the first houses there I  found a man called Il Grassuccio, own brother to Messer Benedetto da  Monte Varchi. [4] I flung off my monks clothes, and became once more a  man. Then we mounted two horses, which were waiting there for us, and  went by night to Siena. Grassuccio returned to Florence, sought out my  father, and gave him the news of my safe escape. In the excess of his  joy, it seemed a thousand years to my father till he should meet the  member of the Eight who had insulted him; and when he came across the  man, he said: See you, Antonio, that it was God who knew what had to  happen to my son, and not yourself? To which the fellow answered: Only  let him get another time into our clutches! And my father: I shall  spend my time in thanking God that He has rescued him from that fate.    Note 1. 'Un di queli arrovellati scotendo la cresto dello arronzinato  cappuccio.' See above, p. 31. The democrats in Cellinis days were  called at Florence 'Arrabbiati' or 'Arrovellati.' In the days of  Savonarola this nickname had been given to the ultra-Medicean party or  Palleschi.    Note 2. 'Lanciotti.' There is some doubt about this word. But it clearly  means men armed with lances, at the disposal of the Signory.    Note 3. 'Un converso,' an attendant on the monks.    Note 4. Benedetto da Monte Varchi was the celebrated poet, scholar, and  historian of Florence, better known as Varchi. Another of his brothers  was a physician of high repute at Florence. They continued throughout  Cellinis life to live on terms of intimacy with him.    XIX    AT Siena I waited for the mail to Rome, which I afterwards joined; and  when we passed the Paglia, we met a courier carrying news of the new  Pope, Clement VII. Upon my arrival in Rome, I went to work in the shop  of the master-goldsmith Santi. He was dead; but a son of his carried on  the business. He did not work himself, but entrusted all his commissions  to a young man named Lucagnolo from Iesi, a country fellow, who while  yet a child had come into Santis service. This man was short but well  proportioned, and was a more skilful craftsman than any one whom I had  met with up to that time; remarkable for facility and excellent in  design. He executed large plate only: that is to say, vases of the  utmost beauty, basons, and such pieces. [1] Having put myself to work  there, I began to make some candelabra for the Bishop of Salamanca, a  Spaniard. [2] They were richly chased, so far as that sort of work  admits. A pupil of Raffaello da Urbino called Gian Francesco, and  commonly known as Il Fattore, was a painter of great ability; and being  on terms of friendship with the Bishop, he introduced me to his favour,  so that I obtained many commissions from that prelate, and earned  considerable sums of money. [3]    During that time I went to draw, sometimes in Michel Agnolos chapel,  and sometimes in the house of Agostino Chigi of Siena, which contained  many incomparable paintings by the hand of that great master Raffaello.  [4] This I did on feast-days, because the house was then inhabited by  Messer Gismondo, Agostinos brother. They plumed themselves exceedingly  when they saw young men of my sort coming to study in their palaces.  Gismondos wife, noticing my frequent presence in that house-she was a  lady as courteous as could be, and of surpassing beauty-came up to me  one day, looked at my drawings, and asked me if I was a sculptor or a  painter; to whom I said I was a goldsmith. She remarked that I drew too  well for a goldsmith; and having made one of her waiting-maids bring a  lily of the finest diamonds set in gold, she showed it to me, and bade  me value it. I valued it at 800 crowns. Then she said that I had very  nearly hit the mark, and asked me whether I felt capable of setting the  stones really well. I said that I should much like to do so, and began  before her eyes to make a little sketch for it, working all the better  because of the pleasure I took in conversing with so lovely and  agreeable a gentlewoman. When the sketch was finished, another Roman  lady of great beauty joined us; she had been above, and now descending  to the ground-floor, asked Madonna Porzia what she was doing there. She  answered with a smile: I am amusing myself by watching this worthy  young man at his drawing; he is as good as he is handsome. I had by  this time acquired a trifle of assurance, mixed, however, with some  honest bashfulness; so I blushed and said: Such as I am, lady, I shall  ever be most ready to serve you. The gentlewoman, also slightly  blushing, said: You know well that I want you to serve me; and  reaching me the lily, told me to take it away; and gave me besides  twenty golden crowns which she had in her bag, and added: Set me the  jewel after the fashion you have sketched, and keep for me the old gold  in which it is now set. On this the Roman lady observed: If I were in  that young mans body, I should go off without asking leave. Madonna  Porzia replied that virtues rarely are at home with vices, and that if I  did such a thing, I should strongly belie my good looks of an honest  man. Then turning round, she took the Roman ladys hand, and with a  pleasant smile said: Farewell, Benvenuto. I stayed on a short while at  the drawing I was making, which was a copy of a Jove by Raffaello. When  I had finished it and left the house, I set myself to making a little  model of wax, in order to show how the jewel would look when it was  completed. This I took to Madonna Porzia, whom I found with the same  Roman lady. Both of them were highly satisfied with my work, and treated  me so kindly that, being somewhat emboldened, I promised the jewel  should be twice as good as the model. Accordingly I set hand to it, and  in twelve days I finished it in the form of a fleur-de-lys, as I have  said above, ornamenting it with little masks, children, and animals,  exquisitely enamelled, whereby the diamonds which formed the lily were  more than doubled in effect.

And the central  object of their worship comes before us as a tortured, persecuted,  slain god--the suffering Dionysus--of whose legend they have their  own special and esoteric version.  That version, embodied in a  supposed Orphic poem, The Occultation of Dionysus, is represented  only by the details that have passed from it into the almost endless  Dionysiaca of Nonnus, a writer of the fourth century; and the imagery  has to be put back into the shrine, bit by bit, and finally  incomplete.  Its central point is the picture of the rending to  pieces of a divine child, of whom a tradition, scanty indeed, but  harmonious in its variations, had long maintained itself.  It was in  memory of it, that those who were initiated into the Orphic mysteries  tasted of the raw flesh of the sacrifice, and thereafter ate flesh no  more; and it connected itself with that strange object in the Delphic  shrine, the grave of Dionysus.    Son, first, of Zeus, and of Persephone whom Zeus woos, in the form of  a serpent--the white, golden-haired child, the best-beloved of his  father, and destined by him to be the ruler of the world, grows up in  secret.  But one day, Zeus, departing on a journey in his great  fondness for the child, delivered to him his crown and staff, and so  left him--shut in a strong tower.  Then it came to pass that the  jealous Here sent [52] out the Titans against him.  They approached  the crowned child, and with many sorts of playthings enticed him  away, to have him in their power, and then miserably slew him--  hacking his body to pieces, as the wind tears the vine, with the axe  Pelekus, which, like the swords of Roland and Arthur, has its proper  name.  The fragments of the body they boiled in a great cauldron, and  made an impious banquet upon them, afterwards carrying the bones to  Apollo, whose rival the young child should have been, thinking to do  him service.  But Apollo, in great pity for this his youngest  brother, laid the bones in a grave, within his own holy place.  Meanwhile, Here, full of her vengeance, brings to Zeus the heart of  the child, which she had snatched, still beating, from the hands of  the Titans.  But Zeus delivered the heart to Semele; and the soul of  the child remaining awhile in Hades, where Demeter made for it new  flesh, was thereafter born of Semele--a second Zagreus--the younger,  or Theban Dionysus.

In such a  picture there must necessarily be a certain artificiality; things  near and far, matter of varying degrees of certainty, fact and  surmise, being reflected and concentrated, for its production, as if  on the surface of a mirror.  Such concrete character, however, Greek  poet or sculptor, from time to time, impressed on the vague world of  popular belief and usage around him; and in the Bacchanals of  Euripides we have an example of the figurative or imaginative power  of poetry, selecting and combining, at will, from that mixed and  floating mass, weaving the many-coloured threads together, blending  the various phases of legend--all the light and shade of the [54]  subject--into a shape, substantial and firmly set, through which a  mere fluctuating tradition might retain a permanent place in men's  imaginations.  Here, in what Euripides really says, in what we  actually see on the stage, as we read his play, we are dealing with a  single real object, not with uncertain effects of many half-fancied  objects.  Let me leave you for a time almost wholly in his hands,  while you look very closely at his work, so as to discriminate its  outlines clearly.    This tragedy of the Bacchanals--a sort of masque or morality, as we  say--a monument as central for the legend of Dionysus as the Homeric  hymn for that of Demeter, is unique in Greek literature, and has also  a singular interest in the life of Euripides himself.  He is writing  in old age (the piece was not played till after his death) not at  Athens, nor for a polished Attic audience, but for a wilder and less  temperately cultivated sort of people, at the court of Archelaus, in  Macedonia.  Writing in old age, he is in that subdued mood, a mood  not necessarily sordid, in which (the shudder at the nearer approach  of the unknown world coming over him more frequently than of old)  accustomed ideas, conformable to a sort of common sense regarding the  unseen, oftentimes regain what they may have lost, in a man's  allegiance.  It is a sort of madness, he begins to think, to differ  from the received opinions thereon.  Not that he is insincere or  ironical, but that he tends, in the [55] sum of probabilities, to  dwell on their more peaceful side; to sit quiet, for the short  remaining time, in the reflexion of the more cheerfully lighted side  of things; and what is accustomed--what holds of familiar usage--  comes to seem the whole essence of wisdom, on all subjects; and the  well-known delineation of the vague country, in Homer or Hesiod,  one's best attainable mental outfit, for the journey thither.  With  this sort of quiet wisdom the whole play is penetrated.  Euripides  has said, or seemed to say, many things concerning Greek religion, at  variance with received opinion; and now, in the end of life, he  desires to make his peace--what shall at any rate be peace with men.  He is in the mood for acquiescence, or even for a palinode; and this  takes the direction, partly of mere submission to, partly of a  refining upon, the authorised religious tradition: he calmly  sophisticates this or that element of it which had seemed grotesque;  and has, like any modern writer, a theory how myths were made, and  how in lapse of time their first signification gets to be obscured  among mortals; and what he submits to, that he will also adorn  fondly, by his genius for words.    And that very neighbourhood afforded him his opportunity.  It was in  the neighbourhood of Pella, the Macedonian capital, that the worship  of Dionysus, the newest of the gods, prevailed in its most  extravagant form--the [56] Thiasus, or wild, nocturnal procession of  Bacchic women, retired to the woods and hills for that purpose, with  its accompaniments of music, and lights, and dancing.  Rational and  moderate Athenians, as we may gather from some admissions of  Euripides himself, somewhat despised all that; while those who were  more fanatical forsook the home celebrations, and went on pilgrimage  from Attica to Cithaeron or Delphi.  But at Pella persons of high  birth took part in the exercise, and at a later period we read in  Plutarch how Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great, was devoted  to this enthusiastic worship.  Although in one of Botticelli's  pictures the angels dance very sweetly, and may represent many  circumstances actually recorded in the Hebrew scriptures, yet we  hardly understand the dance as a religious ceremony; the bare mention  of it sets us thinking on some fundamental differences between the  pagan religions and our own.  It is to such ecstasies, however, that  all nature-worship seems to tend; that giddy, intoxicating sense of  spring--that tingling in the veins, sympathetic with the yearning  life of the earth, having, apparently, in all times and places,  prompted some mode of wild dancing.  Coleridge, in one of his  fantastic speculations, refining on the German word for enthusiasm--  Schwärmerei, swarming, as he says, \"like the swarming of bees  together\"--has explained how the sympathies of mere numbers, as such,  the random catching on [57] fire of one here and another there, when  people are collected together, generates as if by mere contact, some  new and rapturous spirit, not traceable in the individual units of a  multitude.  Such swarming was the essence of that strange dance of  the Bacchic women: literally like winged things, they follow, with  motives, we may suppose, never quite made clear even to themselves,  their new, strange, romantic god.  Himself a woman-like god,--it was  on women and feminine souls that his power mainly fell.  At Elis, it  was the women who had their own little song with which at spring-time  they professed to call him from the sea: at Brasiae they had their  own temple where none but women might"]]]
