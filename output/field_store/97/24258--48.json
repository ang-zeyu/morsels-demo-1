To  this it clung most pertinaciously by its fore paws; and such was the  force of this deceptive instinct, that it remained in the same position  for about three weeks, all this time evidently mistaking the wig for  its mother. It was fed, from time to time, with goat's milk; and, at  length, emancipated itself voluntarily, by quitting the fostering care  of the peruke. The confidence which it ere long assumed, and the  amusing familiarity of its manners, soon rendered it a favorite with  the family. The unsuspecting naturalist had, however, introduced a wolf  in sheep's clothing into his dwelling; for, one morning, on entering  his chamber, the door of which had been imprudently left open, he  beheld his young favorite making a hearty breakfast on a collection of  insects which he had made. In the first transports of his anger, he  resolved to strangle the monkey in his arms; but his rage immediately  gave way to pity, when he perceived that the crime of its voracity had  carried the punishment along with it. In eating the beetles, it had  swallowed several of the pins on which they were transfixed. Its agony,  consequently, became great, and all his efforts were unable to preserve  its life.          ORDER III.    CARNARIA,    BUTCHERING ANIMALS.      This order includes bats, hedgehogs, bears, dogs, wolves, foxes, lions,  weasels, &c.      BATS.    These creatures, partaking both of the nature of quadrupeds and birds,  have excited the wonder of mankind in all ages. There is a great  variety of species, from the common bat of our climate to the vampyre  of South America, whose wings stretch to the extent of two feet. These  animals live in caves and crevices during the day, and sally forth at  evening to catch their prey. For this reason, there is a popular  disgust of the whole tribe; yet the species in our climate are a  harmless race. We cannot say as much of the larger kinds, which  sometimes darken the air, by their abundance, in hot climates. One  species, already mentioned, is a formidable animal.    Captain Stedman, in his \"Narrative of a Five Years' Expedition against  the revolted Negroes of Surinam,\" relates that, on awaking about four  o'clock one morning in his hammock, he was extremely alarmed at finding  himself weltering in congealed blood, and without feeling any pain  whatever. \"The mystery was,\" says Captain Stedman, \"that I had been  bitten by the vampyre, or spectre of Guiana, which is also called the  flying dog of New Spain; and by the Spaniards, _perrovolador_. This is  no other than a bat of monstrous size, that sucks the blood from men  and cattle, while they are fast asleep, even, sometimes, till they die;  and, as the manner in which they proceed is truly wonderful, I shall  endeavor to give a distinct account of it.    \"Knowing, by instinct, that the person they intend to attack is in a  sound slumber, they generally alight near the feet, where, while the  creature continues fanning with his enormous wings, which keeps one  cool, he bites a piece out of the tip of the great toe, so very small,  indeed, that the head of a pin could scarcely be received into the  wound, which is, consequently, not painful; yet, through this orifice,  he continues to suck the blood, until he is obliged to disgorge. He  then begins again, and thus continues sucking and disgorging until he  is scarcely able to fly, and the sufferer has often been known to pass  from time to eternity. Cattle they generally bite in the ear, but  always in places where the blood flows spontaneously. Having applied  tobacco ashes as the best remedy, and washed the gore from myself and  hammock, I observed several small heaps of congealed blood, all round  the place where I had lain, upon the ground; on examining which, the  surgeon judged that I had lost at least twelve or fourteen ounces of  blood.\"    \"Some years ago,\" says Mr. Waterton, in his \"Wanderings in South  America,\" \"I went to the River Paumaron, with a Scotch gentleman, by  name Tarbet. We hung our hammocks in the thatched loft of a planter's  house. Next morning, I heard this gentleman muttering in his hammock,  and now and then letting fall an imprecation or two, just about the  time he ought to have been saying his morning prayers. 'What is the  matter, sir?' said I, softly; 'is any thing amiss?' 'What's the  matter?' answered he, surlily; 'why, the vampyres have been sucking me  to death.' As soon as there was light enough, I went to his hammock,  and saw it much stained with blood. 'There,' said he, thrusting his  foot out of the hammock, 'see how these infernal imps have been drawing  my life's blood.' On examining his foot, I found the vampyre had tapped  his great toe. There was a wound somewhat less than that made by a  leech. The blood was still oozing from it. I conjectured he might have  lost from ten to twelve ounces of blood. Whilst examining it, I think I  put him into a worse humor, by remarking that a European surgeon would  not have been so generous as to have blooded him without making a  charge. He looked up in my face, but did not say a word. I saw he was  of opinion that I had better have spared this piece of ill-timed  levity.\"      HEDGEHOG.    This animal belongs exclusively to the eastern continent, and is well  known from the thick and sharp prickles with which its back and sides  are covered, and the contractile power by which it can draw its head  and belly within the prickly covering of its back, so as to give it the  appearance of a ball. It is found near hedges and thickets, from the  fruits and herbage of which it obtains its food. It also feeds upon  small animals, such as snails and beetles.    The sagacity of the hedgehog is celebrated in antiquity. We are  informed by Plutarch, that a citizen of Cyzicus thus acquired the  reputation of a good meteorologist: A hedgehog generally has its burrow  open in various points; and, when its instinct warns it of an  approaching change of the wind, it stops up the aperture towards that  quarter. The citizen alluded to, becoming aware of this practice, was  able to predict to what point the wind would next shift.    Though of a very timid disposition, the hedgehog has been sometimes  tamed. In the year 1790, there was one in the possession of a Mr.  Sample, in Northumberland, which performed the duty of a turnspit as  well, in all respects, as the dog of that denomination. It ran about  the house with the same familiarity as any other domestic animal.    In the London Sporting Magazine for 1821, there is an account of one,  which, after having been tamed in a garden, found its way to the  scullery, and there made regular search for the relics of the dinner  plates; having its retreat in the adjoining cellar. It was fed after  the manner itself had selected. Milk was given in addition to the meat;  but it lost its relish for vegetables, and constantly rejected them. It  soon became as well domesticated as the cat, and lived on a footing of  intimacy with it.      THE MOLE.    Of this animal there are several species; they burrow in the earth, and  form avenues from one nest to another, like the crossing streets of a  city. Their eyes are small, and so buried in fur as to be invisible,  except on close inspection.    _Mole-Catching._--It has been a common opinion that moles were  destructive to the crops; and in Europe, much pains have been taken to  destroy them. The mole-catcher--in general a quiet old man, who passes  his winter in making his traps, in the chimney-corner--comes forth, in  the spring, with his implements of destruction. His practised eye soon  discovers the tracks of the mole, from the mound which he throws up to  some neighboring bank, or from one mound to another. It is in this  track, or run, that he sets his trap, a few inches below the surface of  the ground. As the mole passes through this little engine of his ruin,  he disturbs a peg which holds down a strong hazel rod in a bent  position. The moment the peg is moved, the end of the rod which is held  down flies up, and with it comes up the poor mole, dragged out of the  earth which he has so ingeniously excavated, to be gibbeted, without a  chance of escape.    There was a Frenchman, of the name of Le Court, who died a few years  since,--a man of great knowledge and perseverance, and who did not  think it beneath him to devote his whole attention to the observation  of the mole. He established a school for mole-catching; and taught many  what he had acquired by incessant perseverance--the art of tracing the  mole to his hiding-place in the ground, and cutting off his retreat.  The skill of this man once saved, as was supposed, a large and fertile  district of France from inundation by a canal, whose banks the moles  had undermined in every direction.    More recently, it has been doubted whether moles are really so  mischievous to the farmer as has been supposed. It is said that they  assist in draining the land, and thus prevent the foot-rot in sheep.  Mr. Hogg, the Ettrick shepherd, says, \"If a hundred men and horses were  employed on a common-sized pasture-farm--say from 1500 to 2000  acres--in raising and draining manure for a top-dressing to the land,  they would not do it so effectually, so equally, and so neatly, as the  natural number of moles on the farm would do for themselves.\"    Moles are said to be very ferocious animals; and, as an evidence of  this, we are told that a mole, a toad, and a viper, were enclosed in a  glass case; the mole despatched the other two, and devoured a great  part of both of them.      THE BEAR.    Of this animal there are many species; among which, the white bear of  the polar regions, and the grisly bear of the eastern slope of the  Rocky Mountains, are the largest and most formidable. The brown bear is  common to both continents."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33721"],[0,"The Barren Ground Caribou of Keewatin (#8)"],[1,"thwest; temperature, 29° to 48°; ground bare. A band of about    15 Caribou appeared on the north side of Windy River at its    mouth. They included four large and two smaller bucks, the    remainder being does and fawns. They were apparently traveling    south.      The 30th was cloudy, with a sprinkle of rain; wind light,    westerly; temperature, 39° to 48°; ground bare. A few black    flies were brought out by the mild weather. During an    all-morning trip to Point Lake, Charles saw no Caribou, but in    the afternoon he reported about 200 on the eastern side of    Little River. There were also half a dozen bucks on the south    side of Windy River.      October 1 was a rare, fine, sunshiny day in the Barrens; wind    moderate to brisk, south to southwest; temperature, 37° to 61°;    ground bare; tundra ponds mostly ice-covered. A blowfly crawled    over a caribou carcass, and possibly a few black flies were    abroad. Two bucks passed from the shoal water of Duck Bay over    Little River Ridge. Charles reported about 40 Caribou moving    north a mile or two north of camp, and I saw a single buck    likewise engaged. During the preceding week or so Fred had seen    a good many of the animals between the upper Kazan River and    Nueltin Lake; they were moving south and west.      The 2nd was another clear day; wind moderate, southwest;    temperature, 41° to 65°; ground bare. About five does and fawns    were seen at dusk in the spruce tract near Four-hill Creek.      The next day was drizzly and foggy throughout; wind light,    southwest to southeast; temperature, 41° to 43.5°. No Caribou    sighted. Eskimos arriving in camp reported them scarce along the    way from the upper Kazan River.      October 4 was a dismal, dark day, with steady light rain    throughout; wind very light, easterly; temperature, 36° to    42.5°. Fred reported 20 Caribou north of camp.      Snow fell throughout the 5th; wind light, north-northwest;    temperature, 31° to 35°. No Caribou sighted.      With 6 inches of snow on the ground in the morning, there was    some additional precipitation during the overcast day of    October 6; wind moderate to brisk, northeast; temperature, 31°    to 33°; waters clear of ice. No Caribou sighted.      October 7 was a generally cloudy day; wind moderate to very    light, northerly; temperature, 24° to 29°; watercourses largely    open. In the morning Charles reported a couple of hundred    Caribou swimming southward across Windy Bay; he considered this    a part of the final southward movement into the timbered    country--apparently initiated by the recent snowstorm. Later he    saw an approximately equal number 2 miles north of camp, moving    toward the bay; and Fred encountered about 50 on the north side    of the bay.      Late on the 8th clouds gave way to sunshine; nearly calm to a    gentle breeze from west and southwest; temperature, 26.5° to    33.5°; 6 inches of snow on ground. I obtained a distant view of    about 100 Caribou resting near Glacier Pond. Perhaps less than a    quarter of them were old bucks; the remainder, younger bucks,    does, and fawns.      October 9 was largely sunny, with light rain in the evening;    wind light to moderate, southwest to south; temperature, 29° to    38°; ground with a 6-inch snow covering. No Caribou sighted.      Some snow fell on the 10th, though the day was partly sunny;    wind very light, south to west; temperature, 33° to 36°. No    Caribou sighted.      Clouds prevailed on the 11th; wind no more than very light,    westerly; temperature, 33° to 38°; about 4 inches of snow on    ground. Charles reported about a thousand Caribou scattered over    a long hill several miles to the northwest; they were not    traveling.      October 12 was marked by clouds, mist, and rain; wind light to    moderate, southwesterly; temperature, 32° to 40°. No Caribou    sighted.      There was a little sun on the 13th; wind light to moderate, west    to east; temperature, 37° to 45.5°; ground largely bare and    tundra ponds open. In the afternoon we set out for Simons' Lake,    and camped about 4 miles up the Windy River. No Caribou sighted.      On the 14th we reached the upper end of Simons' Lake, for a    several days' stay at a deserted trading-post. There were snow    flurries and a little rain; wind brisk, westerly; temperature,    35° to 36°; ground mostly bare. A band of about 15 Caribou,    a solitary buck, and many tracks and droppings were seen along    the way.      October 15 was partly cloudy; wind very light to light, west to    northwest and east; temperature, 21° to 36°. Four Caribou    sighted.      October 16 was a stormy, cloudy day; wind brisk, easterly;    temperature, 30.5° to 34°. About a dozen Caribou were noted in    the vicinity of Simons' Lake.      A strong easterly gale during the night, with heavy rain, was    followed during the day of the 17th by steady rain, with    moderate to light easterly or southeasterly wind; temperature,    35° to 38°. A single Caribou seen.      October 18 was partly cloudy; wind brisk to light, westerly;    temperature, 31° to 41°; waters open; some small patches of snow    in sight. Four Caribou (at least two of them bucks) passed by.      The 19th was partly cloudy; nearly calm to moderate wind, west    and northwest; temperature, 30° to 40°. About five or six bucks    (three of them together) appeared, perhaps moving south.      The weather on the 20th was raw, dismal, and gusty; wind brisk,    northwest; temperature, 27° to about 35°; some ice on Simons'    Lake; a little fresh snow on higher hills. No Caribou sighted.      October 21 was somewhat foggy; nearly calm; temperature, 25° to    32°; Simons' Lake partly frozen; ground generally bare. A lone    fawn was seen as we started on the return trip to the Windy    River post.      The 22nd was largely sunny; wind very light to brisk,    southwesterly; temperature, about 30° to 46°. A medium-sized    buck was seen near the mouth of Windy River.      The 23rd was largely cloudy; wind brisk, southwest; temperature,    35° to 39°; ground practically all bare; bay and river open.    A buck started to cross to the north side of Windy River, but    went back.      For the better part of a week, till October 29, I found no    further fresh indications of Caribou in our vicinity. In the    meantime the weather was largely cloudy, with some rain and snow    (4-5 inches of the latter on the 27th); winds very light to    moderate, swinging from east to south and west; temperature, 27°    to 50°; waters generally open.      October 29 was largely cloudy; a gentle wind, south to east;    temperature, 29° to 35°; 4-5 inches of snow on ground; thin ice    on a tundra pond. The fresh track of a buck (fig. 20) was found    near camp.      On the 30th gentle rain changed to snow; calm to a moderate    wind, northeast to north; temperature, 30° to 33°. Tracks showed    the passing of about a dozen Caribou, including half a dozen    that swam westward across the mouth of Little River, breaking    through a rim of ice at the edge.      Clouds prevailed on the 31st; wind moderate to brisk, northerly;    temperature, 17° to 25.5°; 5-6 inches of snow on ground, with    drifts up to a foot deep; river and lake open. Fred reported    three Caribou.      November 1 marked the long-delayed \"freeze-up.\" Windy Bay and    the edges of Windy River were frozen, while pieces of ice    floated down the river. The day was cloudy, with continual snow    flurries after noon; wind light to brisk, southeast;    temperature, 21° to 31°; about 6 inches of snow on ground.      The 2nd was cloudy, with some rain and sleet; wind moderate to    brisk, southeast to west; temperature, 29° to 34°. No Caribou    sighted for two days.      On the 3rd it was cloudy all day; wind light, northwest;    temperature, 16° to 20°. A herd of about 50 Caribou (largely    does, with a few fawns and well-antlered bucks) hurried down the    side of Little River Ridge onto the ice of Duck Bay, with the    apparent intention of crossing to the south side of Windy Bay;    but they were intercepted by a hunter and retreated    northwestward along the ridge. Fred secured three    southward-traveling bucks at a distance from camp.      No Caribou were sighted on the three following days (November 4    to 6), which were more or less cloudy, with some snow; wind    light to brisk, southerly to northerly; temperature, 13° to    24.5°; ice 3 inches thick on Windy Bay; about 6 inches of snow    on ground.      There was snow during the night of November 6 and the morning of    the 7th, resulting in drifts up to a yard deep; wind brisk,    northerly; temperature, -3° to 13°. Fred reported \"lots\" of    Caribou some 10 miles to the north, moving south.      The next three days (November 8 to 10) varied from cloudy (with    a snow flurry) to sunny; wind moderate to strong, northwest and    north; temperature, -10.5° to 1°; 6-8 inches of snow (much    drifted); Windy River gradually becoming ice-covered. No Caribou    sighted.      November 11 was partly sunny; wind moderate to brisk, northerly;    temperature, 3° to 6.5°; about 8 inches of snow on the average.    Mike Schweder reported five does moving south across the mouth    of Windy River on the ice.      Thereafter, until my departure on December 4, no more Caribou    were actually seen in the vicinity of the headquarters on Windy    River. There were, however, tracks of single animals on November    15 and 16. Moreover, during the period from about November 7 to    15, while traveling northward to the upper Kazan River, Charles    Schweder saw thousands of Caribou, in herds up to 300, moving    southward. He surmised that their course took them somewhere    between Ennadai and Nueltin lakes. Fred also reported many to    the northward on the 7th, as already noted. This was perhaps the    last large migratory movement of the year in our general area."]]]
