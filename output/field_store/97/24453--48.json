But, in the first  place, even public opinion, when not prejudiced in favour of the  so-called consequences of irresponsibility, recognises in many  familiar and everyday cases that there are criminals who, without  being mad, are still not as ordinary men; and the reporters call  them ``human tigers,'' ``brutes,'' and the like.  And in the  second place, the scientific proofs of these hereditary  tenden<p 30>cies to crime, even apart from the clinical forms of  mental alienation, are now so numerous that it is useless to  insist upon them further.    The third class is that of the criminals whom, after my prison  experience, I have called criminals by contracted habit.  These  are they who, not presenting the anthropological characteristics  of the born criminals, or presenting them but slightly, commit  their first crime most commonly in youth, or even in childhood--  almost invariably a crime against property, and far more through  moral weakness, induced by circumstances and a corrupting  environment, than through inborn and active tendencies.  After  this, as M. Joly observes, either they are led on by the impunity  of their first offences, or, more decisively, prison associations  debilitate and corrupt them, morally and physically, the cell  degrades them, alcoholism renders them stupid and subject to  impulse, and they continually fall back into crime, and become  chronically prone to it.  And society, which thus abandons them,  before and after they leave their prison, to wretchedness,  idleness, and temptations, gives them no assistance in their  struggle to gain an honest livelihood, even when it does not  thrust them back into crime by harassing police regulations, which  prevent them from finding or keeping honest employment.[7]      [7] Fliche, ``Comment en devient Criminel,'' Paris, 1886.        Of those criminals who begin by being occasional criminals, and  end, after progressive degeneration, by exhibiting the features of  the born criminals, Thomas More said, ``What is this but to make  thieves for the <p 31>pleasure of hanging them?''  And it is just  this class of criminals whom measures of social prevention might  reduce to a minimum, for by abolishing the causes we abolish the  effects.    Apart from their organic and psychological characteristics, innate  or acquired, there are two bio-sociological symptoms which seem to  me to be common, though for distinct reasons, to born criminals  and habitual criminals.  I mean precocity and relapse.  The  occasional crime and the crime of passion do not, as a rule, occur  before manhood, and rarely or never lead to relapse.    Here are a few figures concerning precocity, derived from  international prison statistics:--      PRISONERS UNDER 20 YEARS OF AGE.                  Male.    Female.  __________________________________________________________________                                                      p.c.     p.c.

Out of 146,217 accused before the tribunals there were 4 per  cent. under sixteen, and 14 per cent. between sixteen and twenty-  one.  Out of 25,135 females there were 4 per cent. under sixteen,  and 11 per cent. between sixteen and twenty-one; whilst in 1886  the percentages were 3 and 14 of males, 2.5 and 14 of females.    In Prussia, of persons accused of crimes and offences in 1860-70,  4 per cent. were under eighteen years.    In Germany, of persons condemned in 1886, 3 per cent. were between  twelve and fifteen, 6 per cent. between fifteen and eighteen, and  16 per cent. between eighteen and twenty-one years.    In Italy, out of 5,189 persons condemned at the assizes in 1887, 3  per cent. were between fourteen and eighteen, and 12 per cent.  between eighteen and twenty-one.  Out of 65,624 tried before the  tribunals, 1.2 per cent. were under fourteen, 5 per cent. were  between fourteen and eighteen, and 13 per cent. between eighteen  and twenty-one.  There is a continual increase of precocious  criminals in Italy.  Prisoners condemned at the assizes under the  age of twenty-one stood at 15 per cent. from 1880 to 1887, whilst  those of a similar age who were tried before the tribunals rose  from 17 to 20 per cent.    To these numerical data may be added others of a qualificative  character, showing that precocity is most frequent in respect of  the natural crimes and offences which are usually observed amongst  born and habitual criminals.  <p 33>    In France the younger prisoners in 1882 had been sentenced in the  following proportions:--                                                 Male.

He attended school  in Farmington until he was fourteen years of age.    On the first of May, 1821, he went to live with Col. George Cowles  with whom he remained two years. While there he attended school in the  winter and worked upon a farm during the {22} summer months. It was  while living with Mr. Cowles that Wilford again witnessed a religious  revival which was conducted by the Presbyterians, who were at that  time the only sect in Farmington. Of this second revival he writes: \"I  attended the meetings, inquiry, Sunday schools, and prayer meetings.  I tried to get religion by effort and prayer, but my efforts created  darkness instead of light and I was not happy in the attempt. They  wanted us to give our hearts to God without telling us what to do or  explaining any principle in a comprehensive manner. There were many  young people at that time of my age who made a profession of religion.  I did not wish to make a mockery of sacred things by professing light  when I had received none, so I kept aloof from all professions.\"    At this time the Woodruff family was undergoing a severe struggle  for a livelihood. Young Wilford lived out, first with one and then  with another, working hard during the summer and fall and attending  school in the winter. In the year 1823 while making his abode with Mr.  Andrew Mills he underwent his first attack of homesickness. \"Mr. Mills  was a proud and austere man,\" he writes, \"I had never before lived  at a place where I did not feel free and sociable, and there was no  conversation between us except to ask or answer a question. I ate and  slept very little there for two weeks. Relief, however, came to me when  I started to school and made the acquaintance of my fellow students. My  homesickness left me and never came back.    \"I returned home in 1825, soon after which my father made a contract  with Mr. Horace Todd that I should work one year with him.\" The year,  however, did not pass before the boy split his instep with an ax. This  ended his service there, but his brother Thompson took the place there  and worked the year out. \"Thus we kept our contract.\" Wilford was  crippled for nine months. At the end of that time he left home on horse  back in search of work. Again misfortune overtook him. He was thrown  from his horse and compelled to return home where he remained for some  time. There was always a welcome in his home, because of the love and  respect every member of the family entertained for him.    Part of the time up to April, 1827, he remained at home, {23} and part  of the time he was engaged in working for other people. At that time he  was twenty years of age and left his home never to return except as a  visitor. He first went to live with his Aunt Helen Wheeler. He took her  flour mill at East Avon on shares and worked it for three years. During  that time he established himself in the trade of a miller.    Notwithstanding his youth at the time of leaving home, his soul  was full of deep and serious thoughts. They were ennobling in their  character and safeguarded the young man along the slippery paths of  youth. Here are some of the reflections of those days: \"This is an  important period of my life. As I leave my father's home to enter upon  the stage of life to act for myself, to be my own counselor, and to  form my own character in the broad open world, my mind is filled with  serious reflections. I am full of anxiety--an anxiety which is painful  to me. Should I outlive my parents, how long will it be before I shall  follow them to the grave? It will be said of them: 'They have gone the  way of all flesh and their children will follow them into the same  eternal world.' My age is an important period in the life of every man;  for, generally speaking, at this period of life man forms much of his  character for time and eternity. How cautious I ought to be in passing  this landmark along the road of my early existence! I feel that I need  care, prudence, circumspection, and wisdom to guide my footsteps in the  path which leads to honor and eternal life.\"    Later on, referring to this same period of life, he says: \"I reflected  further upon the days of my youth which were gone, and upon the  fleetness of time that had flown like an arrow to return no more. I  reasoned thus: while walking through a rapid stream, we cannot tread  twice in the same water, neither can we twice spend the same time.  Then how ought we to prize the golden moments and measure time by our  talents to the honor and glory of God and for the salvation of our  souls; so that when the Lord comes, He may receive His own with usury.    \"In trying to comprehend the fleetness of time, I have asked myself  these questions. Where is the old world? Where are the millions of the  earth's inhabitants, including my own ancestors? And where are the days  of my youth? They are gone--all {24} gone into the boundless ocean of  eternity where I shall soon find myself.\"    This remarkable state of his mind at that youthful period of life is  so unusual in young men of that age that it is quite reasonable to  suppose that he was undergoing a mental struggle on questions of right  and wrong. It was not simply with him a question of good and bad;  has conscience told him what his conduct ought to be in the presence  of temptation. What he wanted to know, what he was yearning to learn  was some positive rule of life that would govern and guide him in the  formation of correct religious doctrines.    In those times it was thought no evil to indulge in card playing and  pastimes of a similar character. He occasionally took a hand in these  games, but soon withdrew from such recreation, since he believed card  playing to be a vice. His journal shows that he understood the dangers  that arise from the so-called respectability of companionship when  such companions are thoughtless, indifferent, and self-indulgent. \"The  religious influence of such men,\" he writes, \"where it is bad is most  to be dreaded. The vulgar and dissipated will not have much influence  over the man who intends to maintain a fair standing in society. On the  other hand, the respectable man may lead him step by step into such  evils that bring upon him, before he is aware of it, sorrow, disgrace,  misery, and shame.    \"If I was ever led to stake anything at the card table, I had the  providential good fortune to lose. There was thus cut off the natural  encouragement to engage in such a vice. In all these recreations  there was a spirit working within me which drew my attention to inner  thoughts of a nobler sort until I lost all desire for cards and the  ball room and for the company of those who enjoyed that kind of  pleasure. So much was this the case, that I felt like a speckled bird  in the midst of my companions. Indeed, I learned by experience and by  the workings of the spirit of the Lord within my own soul that the  transitory pleasures of human life do not in any way constitute true  and lasting happiness.\"    Before launching out in business for himself, he says: \"I had not  acquired much taste for reading. Having at my disposal each day several  leisure hours, I felt impressed that I must not {25} squander time  in idleness. I did not care for novel reading. I believed it to be  useless. Nor had I much taste for history, having read but little of  it. One day while reading a school book, I came across these remarkable  words: 'He that will spend his life in that manner which is most  exaltant will find that custom will render it most delightsome.'\"    These words made a strong impression upon his mind. He at once began  to read history. At first he read too much at a time to remember, to  digest, and to profit by it. After a judicious regulation of this  mental pastime, he read carefully histories of the United States,  England, Scotland, Greece, and Rome. He read Rollin's Ancient History,  Josephus, and other books. They became to him a delight, and from them  he gained much that was helpful.    \"By perusing history,\" he writes, \"we hold converse with men of  judgment, wisdom, and knowledge. I finally took up the Bible as a  study of history and I never found any history equally interesting  until later on I read the Book of Mormon. While reading these books  we converse, as it were, with the Lord and with His holy prophets  and apostles. In studying the Word of the Lord we learn truths which  cannot be acquired from any other source. Those books which contain the  revelations of heaven are of far more interest than books containing  merely the opinions, theories, and doctrines of men.\"    During his further stay with his Aunt Helen, he encountered other  religious revivals without any benefit to him further than to emphasize  his convictions that the gospel in its purity was not among the people  at that time and place.    At that time he was called upon to mourn the demise of his beloved  brother, Philo. A few months prior to his death, Philo dreamed that an  angel from heaven was going through the streets of the town with a roll  containing a list of those who should die during the year in that town.  The angel approached Philo and unfolded to him the roll, at the same  time he informed him that on November 27th there would be a funeral at  his father's house. Philo recorded the dream in his journal. On the  very day named by the angel his own funeral occurred at his father's  home. The fulfillment of this strange dream made a lasting impression  on Wilford's mind.    {26} The year following, another very remarkable circumstance occurred  which was equally impressive to his thoughtful and spiritual mind.  He writes: \"I was called to sit up for the night with the remains of  a young man named Henry Miller. He had been very wicked and profane.  The day before his death, he attended a celebration of the nation's  birthday, July 4th. The boy's father, who was a religious, God-fearing"]]]
