Pace,  in announcing it to Wolsey, pointed out that the Emperor spoke without  the consent of the Electors, that Maximilian was thoroughly  untrustworthy, and that Henry in such an enterprise might imperil his  hold upon the English Crown, \"which,\" writes Pace with pardonable pride,  \"is this day more esteemed than the Emperor's crown and all his empire.\"  Henry was of the same opinion; and Maximilian failed on this plea \"to  pluck money from the king craftily.\" Pace remained, and jingled English  money in Maximilian's ear, as a means of preventing him from turning to  France; but not a penny was Maximilian allowed to touch, to Sir Robert  Wingfield's great annoyance. Pace so far succeeded, that when, in  November 1516, Francis I. made an alliance with the Swiss, five of the  cantons stood aloof. Pace was rewarded for his labours and sufferings by  being made a secretary of state. Sir Robert Wingfield received a severe  rebuke from the king, which sorely disturbed his self-complacency. But  it is characteristic of Wolsey's absence of personal feeling that  Wingfield was not recalled from his post. Wolsey saw that he had been no  more foolish than most other Englishmen would have been in his place.    Meanwhile a change had taken place in the affairs of Europe which turned  the attention of France and England alike in a new direction. Ferdinand  the Catholic died in January 1516, and the preponderance of France had  so alarmed him that he laid aside his plan of dividing the power of the  House of Austria by instituting his second grandson, Ferdinand, King of  Spain. After the battle of Marignano he changed his will in favour of  his eldest grandson, the Archduke Charles, who now added the Spanish  kingdoms to his possession of the Netherlands. The young prince had just  emancipated himself from the tutelage of Maximilian, but was under the  influence of ministers who pursued a purely Flemish policy, and longed  to give peace to the Netherlands by an alliance with France. England was  connected with Flanders by commercial interests, and long negotiations  had been conducted with the Flemish Government for a close alliance. But  Charles's advisers were won over by France, and Charles himself was  attracted by the hope of a French marriage. His position was difficult,  as he was poor and helpless; he could not even go to take possession of  the Spanish Crowns without help from one side or the other. Had he been  older and wiser he would have seen that it was safer to accept the gold  of Henry VIII., from whose future projects he had nothing to fear,  rather than try and secure a precarious peace for the Netherlands by an  alliance with France. However, Charles turned a cold ear to the English  ambassadors, and his ministers secretly brought about a treaty with  France, which was signed at Noyon in August 1516.    The Treaty of Noyon was a further rebuff to Wolsey, England was passed  by in silence, and a tempting bait was laid to draw Maximilian also into  the French alliance, and so leave England entirely without allies.  Maximilian had been for some time at war with Venice about the  possession of the towns of Brescia and Verona. The Treaty of Noyon  provided that the Venetians should pay the Emperor 200,000 crowns and  remain in possession of the disputed territory. Maximilian used this  offer to put himself up to auction; he expressed his detestation of the  peace of Noyon, but pleaded that unless Henry came to his help he would  be driven by poverty to accept the proffered terms. Henry answered by a  proposal that Maximilian should earn the price he fixed upon his  services: let him come into the Netherlands, and work the overthrow of  the unworthy ministers who gave such evil advice to their sovereign.  Maximilian stipulated for the allowance which he was to receive for the  expenses of a journey to the Netherlands, for which he began to make  preparations. He raised all possible doubts and difficulties, and  received all the money he could extract on any pretext from Henry VIII.;  at last he secretly signed the Treaty of Noyon in December, and drew his  payments from both parties so long as he could keep his game unsuspected.    But Wolsey was not so much deceived as Maximilian thought, and showed no  discomfiture when Maximilian's shiftiness at length came to light. If  Maximilian would not be faithful it was well that his untrustworthiness  should be openly shown, and Francis I., who was watching his manoeuvres,  could not feel proud of his new ally. He knew what he had to expect from  Maximilian when the 200,000 crowns were spent. The money that had been  spent on Maximilian was not wasted if it gave him an encouragement to  display his feebleness to the full.    So Henry maintained a dignified attitude, and showed no resentment. He  received Maximilian's excuses with cold politeness, and waited for  Francis I. to discover the futility of his new alliances. Maximilian was  clearly of no account. Charles had gained all that he could gain from  his league with France towards quieting the Netherlands; for his next  step, a journey to Spain, he needed the help of England, and soon  dropped his attitude of indifference. After thwarting England as much as  he could, he was driven to beg for a loan to cover the expenses of his  journey, and England showed no petty resentment for his past conduct.  The loan was negotiated, Charles's ambassadors were honourably received,  it was even proposed that he should visit Henry on his way. This honour  Charles cautiously declined on the ground of ill health; but all the  other marks of Henry's goodwill were accepted with gratitude, and in  September 1517 Charles set out on his voyage to Spain, where he found  enough to employ his energies for some time.    This conciliatory attitude of England was due to a perception that the  time had come when simple opposition to France was no longer useful.  England had so far succeeded as to prevent the French ascendency from  being complete; she had stemmed the current, had shown Francis I. the  extent of her resources, and had displayed unexpected skill. Moreover,  she had made it clear that neither she nor France could form a  combination sufficiently powerful to enable the one to crush the other,  and had given Francis I. a lesson as to the amount of fidelity he might  expect from his allies. When it was clear to both sides that there was  no hope for far-reaching schemes, it was natural for the two powers to  draw together, and seek a reasonable redress for the grievances which  immediately affected them.    Chief amongst these on the French side was the possession of Tournai by  the English, glorious, no doubt, as a trophy of English valour, but of  very doubtful advantage to England. Negotiations about its restoration  were begun as early as March 1517, and were conducted with profound  secrecy. Of course Charles hoped to get Tournai into his own hands, and  did not wish it to be restored to France. It was necessary to keep him  in ignorance of what was going on, and not till he had sailed to Spain  were there any rumours of what was passing.    Wolsey and Henry VIII. deceived the ambassadors of Charles and of Venice  by their repeated professions of hostility against France, and Charles's  remonstrances were answered by equivocations, so that he had no  opportunity for interfering till the matter had been agreed upon as part  of a close alliance between England and France. The negotiations for  this purpose were long and intricate, and form the masterpiece of  Wolsey's diplomatic skill. They were made more difficult by the outbreak  in England of a pestilence, the sweating sickness, before which Henry  fled from London and moved uneasily from place to place. Wolsey was  attacked by it in June so seriously that his life was despaired of;  scarcely was he recovered when he suffered from a second attack, and  soon after went on a pilgrimage to Walsingham to perform a vow and enjoy  change of air. But with this exception, he stuck manfully to his work in  London, where, beside his manifold duties in internal administration, he  directed the course of the negotiations with France.    In fact Wolsey alone was responsible for the change of policy indicated  by the French alliance. He had thoroughly carried the king with him; but  he was well aware that his course was likely to be exceedingly  unpopular, and that on him would fall the blame of any failure. Henry  did not even inform his Council of his plans. He knew that they would  all have been opposed to such a sudden change of policy, which could  only be justified in their eyes by its manifest advantage in the end.  Wolsey was conscious that he must not only conclude an alliance with  France, but must show beyond dispute a clear gain to England from so  doing.    Wolsey's difficulties were somewhat lessened by the birth of an heir to  the French Crown in February 1518. France could now offer, as a  guarantee for her close alliance with England, a proposal of marriage  between the Dauphin and Henry's only daughter Mary. Still the  negotiations cautiously went on while Wolsey drove the hardest bargain  that he could. They were not finished till September, when a numerous  body of French nobles came on a splendid embassy to London. Never had  such magnificence been seen in England before as that with which Henry  VIII. received his new allies. Even the French nobles admitted that it  was beyond their power to describe. Wolsey entertained the company at a  sumptuous supper in his house at Westminster, \"the like of which,\" says  the Venetian envoy, \"was never given by Cleopatra or Caligula, the whole  banqueting hall being decorated with huge vases of gold and silver.\"  After the banquet a band of mummers, wearing visors on their faces,  entered and danced. There were twelve ladies and twelve gentlemen,  attended by twelve torch-bearers; all were clad "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5396"],[0,"The Crisis — Complete (#8)"],[1,"stone flagging before him. Her suffering was stamped on the little man's  face--and it seemed to Stephen that this was but one trial more which  adversity had brought to Mr. Canter.    \"Nancy,\" he answered (how often, and to how many, must he have had to  say the same thing), \"I haven't the money, Nancy. Would to God that I  had, Nancy!\"    She had sunk down on the bricks. But she had not fainted. It was not so  merciful as that. It was Stephen who lifted her, and helped her to the  coping, where she sat with her bandanna awry.    Stephen was not of a descent to do things upon impulse. But the tale  was told in after days that one of his first actions in St. Louis was of  this nature. The waters stored for ages in the four great lakes, given  the opportunity, rush over Niagara Falls into Ontario.    \"Take the woman away,\" said Stephen, in a low voice, \"and I will buy the  girl,--if I can.\"    The little man looked up, dazed.    \"Give me your card,--your address. I will buy the girl, if I can, and  set her free.\"    He fumbled in his pocket and drew out a dirty piece of pasteboard. It  read: \"R. Canter, Second Hand Furniture, 20 Second Street.\" And still  he stared at Stephen, as one who gazes upon a mystery. A few curious  pedestrians had stopped in front of them.    \"Get her away, if you can, for God's sake,\" said Stephen again. And he  strode off toward the people at the auction. He was trembling. In his  eagerness to reach a place of vantage before the girl was sold, he  pushed roughly into the crowd.    But suddenly he was brought up short by the blocky body of Mr. Hopper,  who grunted with the force of the impact.    \"Gosh,\" said that gentleman, \"but you are inters'ted. They ain't begun  to sell her yet--he's waitin' for somebody. Callatin' to buy her?\" asked  Mr. Hopper, with genial humor.    Stephen took a deep breath. If he knocked Mr. Hopper down, he certainly  could not buy her. And it was a relief to know that the sale had not  begun.    As for Eliphalet, he was beginning to like young Brice. He approved  of any man from Boston who was not too squeamish to take pleasure in a  little affair of this kind.    As for Stephen, Mr. Hopper brought him back to earth. He ceased  trembling, and began to think.    \"Tarnation!\" said Eliphalet. \"There's my boss, Colonel Carvel across the  street. Guess I'd better move on. But what d'ye think of him for a real  Southern gentleman?\"    \"The young dandy is his nephew, Clarence Colfax. He callates to own this  town.\" Eliphalet was speaking leisurely, as usual, while preparing to  move. \"That's Virginia Carvel, in red. Any gals down Boston-way to beat  her? Guess you won't find many as proud.\"    He departed. And Stephen glanced absently at the group. They were  picking their way over the muddy crossing toward him. Was it possible  that these people were coming to a slave auction? Surely not. And yet  here they were on the pavement at his very side.    She wore a long Talma of crimson cashmere, and her face was in that most  seductive of frames, a scoop bonnet of dark green velvet, For a fleeting  second her eyes met his, and then her lashes fell. But he was aware,  when he had turned away, that she was looking at him again. He grew  uneasy. He wondered whether his appearance betrayed his purpose, or made  a question of his sanity.    Sanity! Yes, probably he was insane from her point of view. A sudden  anger shook him that she should be there calmly watching such a scene.    Just then there was a hush among the crowd. The beautiful slave-girl was  seized roughly by the man in charge and thrust forward, half fainting,  into view. Stephen winced. But unconsciously he turned, to see the  effect upon Virginia Carvel.    Thank God! There were tears upon her lashes.    Here was the rasp of the auctioneer's voice:-- \"Gentlemen, I reckon  there ain't never been offered to bidders such an opportunity as this  heah. Look at her well, gentlemen. I ask you, ain't she a splendid  creature?\"    Colonel Carvel, in annoyance, started to move on. \"Come Jinny,\" he said,  \"I had no business to bring you aver.\"    But Virginia caught his arm. \"Pa,\" she cried, \"it's Mr. Benbow's Hester.  Don't go, dear. Buy her for me You know that I always wanted her.  Please!\"    The Colonel halted, irresolute, and pulled his goatee Young Colfax  stepped in between them.    \"I'll buy her for you, Jinny. Mother promised you a present, you know,  and you shall have her.\"    Virginia had calmed.    \"Do buy her, one of you,\" was all she said    \"You may do the bidding, Clarence,\" said the Colonel, \"and we'll settle  the ownership afterward.\" Taking Virginia's arm, he escorted her across  the street.    Stephen was left in a quandary. Here was a home for the girl, and a good  one. Why should me spend the money which meant so much to him. He saw  the man Jenkin elbowing to the front. And yet--suppose Mr. Colfax did  not get her? He had promised to buy her if he could, and to set her  free:    Stephen had made up his mind: He shouldered his way after Jenkins.          CHAPTER V. THE FIRST SPARK PASSES    \"Now, gentlemen,\" shouted the auctioneer when he had finished his  oration upon the girl's attractions, \"what 'tin I bid? Eight hundred?\"    Stephen caught his breath. There was a long pause no one cared to start  the bidding.    \"Come, gentlemen, come! There's my friend Alf Jenkins. He knows what  she's worth to a cent. What'll you give, Alf? Is it eight hundred?\"    Mr. Jenkins winked at the auction joined in the laugh.    \"Three hundred!\" he said.    The auctioneer was mortally offended. Then some one cried:--\"Three  hundred and fifty!\"    It was young Colfax. He was recognized at once, by name, evidently as a  person of importance.    \"Thank you, Mistah Colfax, suh,\" said the auctioneer, with a servile  wave of the hand in his direction, while the crowd twisted their  necks to see him. He stood very straight, very haughty, as if entirely  oblivious to his conspicuous position.    \"Three seventy-five!\"    \"That's better, Mistah Jenkins,\" said the auctioneer, sarcastically. He  turned to the girl, who might have stood to a sculptor for a figure of  despair. Her hands were folded in front of her, her head bowed down. The  auctioneer put his hand under her chin and raised it roughly. \"Cheer up,  my gal,\" he said, \"you ain't got nothing to blubber about now.\"    Hester's breast heaved and from her black eyes there shot a magnificent  look of defiance. He laughed. That was the white blood.    The white blood!    Clarence Colfax had his bid taken from his lips. Above the heads of  the people he had a quick vision of a young man with a determined face,  whose voice rang clear and strong,-- \"Four hundred!\"    Even the auctioneer, braced two ways, was thrown off his balance by the  sudden appearance of this new force. Stephen grew red over the sensation  he made. Apparently the others present had deemed competition with such  as Jenkins and young Colfax the grossest folly. He was treated to much  liberal staring before the oily salesman arranged his wits to grapple  with the third factor.    Four hundred from--from--from that gentleman. And the chubby index  seemed the finger of scorn.    \"Four hundred and fifty!\" said Mr. Colfax, defiantly.    Whereupon Mr. Jenkins, the New Orleans dealer, lighted a very long cigar  and sat down on the coping. The auctioneer paid no attention to this  manoeuvre. But Mr. Brice and Mr. Colfax, being very young, fondly  imagined that they had the field to themselves, to fight to a finish.    Here wisdom suggested in a mild whisper to Stephen that there was a last  chance to pull out. And let Colfax have the girl? Never. That was pride,  and most reprehensible. But second he thought of Mr. Canter and of  Nancy, and that was not pride.    \"Four seventy-five!\" he cried.    \"Thank you, suh.\"    \"Now fur it, young uns!\" said the wag, and the crowd howled with  merriment.    \"Five hundred!\" snapped Mr. Colfax.    He was growing angry. But Stephen was from New England, and poor, and he  thought of the size of his purse. A glance at his adversary showed that  his blood was up. Money was plainly no consideration to him, and young  Colfax did not seem to be the kind who would relish returning to a young  lady and acknowledge a defeat.    Stephen raised the bid by ten dollars. The Southerner shot up fifty.  Again Stephen raised it ten. He was in full possession of himself now,  and proof against the thinly veiled irony of the oily man's remarks  in favor of Mr. Colfax. In an incredibly short time the latter's  impetuosity had brought them to eight hundred and ten dollars.    Then several things happened very quickly.    Mr. Jenkins got up from the curb and said, \"Eight hundred and  twenty-five,\" with his cigar in his mouth. Scarcely had the hum of  excitement died when Stephen, glancing at Colfax for the next move,  saw that young gentleman seized from the rear by his uncle, the tall  Colonel. And across the street was bliss Virginia Carvel, tapping her  foot on the pavement.    \"What are you about, sir?\" the Colonel cried. \"The wench isn't worth  it.\"    \"Mr. Colfax shook himself free.    \"I've got to buy her now, sir,\" he cried.    \"I reckon not,\" said the Colonel. \"You come along with me.\"    Naturally Mr. Colfax was very angry. He struggled but he went. And so,  protesting, he passed Stephen, at whom he did not deign to glance. The  humiliation of it must have been great for Mr. Colfax. \"Jinny wants her;  sir,\" he said, \"and I have a right to buy her.\"    \"Jinny wants everything,\" was the Colonel's reply. And in a single look  of curiosity and amusement his own gray eyes met Stephen's. They seemed  to regret that this young man, too, had not a guardian. Then uncle and  nephew recrossed the street, and as they walked off the Colonel was seen  to laugh. Virginia had her chin in the air, and Clarence's was in his  collar.    The crowd, of course, indulged in roars of laughter, and even"]]]
