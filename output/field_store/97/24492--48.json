[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5341"],[0,"Kilmeny of the Orchard (#8)"],[1,"she was very pretty--tall and splendid, like a queen,  with great thick braids of black hair and red, red cheeks and lips.  Everybody who saw her looked at her a second time. She was a little  vain of her beauty, I think, Master. And she was proud, oh, she was very  proud. She liked to be first in everything, and she couldn't bear not to  show to good advantage. She was dreadful determined, too. You couldn't  budge her an inch, Master, when she once had made up her mind on any  point. But she was warm-hearted and generous. She could sing like an  angel and she was very clever. She could learn anything with just one  look at it and she was terrible fond of reading.    \"When I'm talking about her like this it all comes back to me, just what  she was like and how she looked and spoke and acted, and little ways she  had of moving her hands and head. I declare it almost seems as if  she was right here in this room instead of being over there in the  churchyard. I wish you'd light the lamp, Master. I feel kind of  nervous.\"    Eric rose and lighted the lamp, rather wondering at Mrs. Williamson's  unusual exhibition of nerves. She was generally so calm and composed.    \"Thank you, Master. That's better. I won't be fancying now that Margaret  Gordon's here listening to what I'm saying. I had the feeling so strong  a moment ago.    \"I suppose you think I'm a long while getting to Kilmeny, but I'm coming  to that. I didn't mean to talk so much about Margaret, but somehow my  thoughts got taken up with her.    \"Well, Margaret passed the Board and went to Queen's Academy and got  a teacher's license. She passed pretty well up when she came out, but  Janet told me she cried all night after the pass list came out because  there were some ahead of her.    \"She went to teach school over at Radnor. It was there she met a man  named Ronald Fraser. Margaret had never had a beau before. She could  have had any young man in Lindsay if she had wanted him, but she  wouldn't look at one of them. They said it was because she thought  nobody was good enough for her, but that wasn't the way of it at all,  Master. I knew, because Margaret and I used to talk of those matters,  as girls do. She didn't believe in going with anybody unless it was  somebody she thought everything of. And there was nobody in Lindsay she  cared that much for.    \"This Ronald Fraser was a stranger from Nova Scotia and nobody knew much  about him. He was a widower, although he was only a young man. He had  set up store-keeping in Radnor and was doing well. He was real handsome  and had taking ways women like. It was said that all the Radnor girls  were in love with him, but I don't think his worst enemy could have said  he flirted with them. He never took any notice of them; but the very  first time he saw Margaret Gordon he fell in love with her and she with  him.    \"They came over to church in Lindsay together the next Sunday and  everybody said it would be a match. Margaret looked lovely that day, so  gentle and womanly. She had been used to hold her head pretty high, but  that day she held it drooping a little and her black eyes cast down.  Ronald Fraser was very tall and fair, with blue eyes. They made as  handsome a couple as I ever saw.    \"But old James Gordon and Thomas and Janet didn't much approve of him. I  saw that plain enough one time I was there and he brought Margaret home  from Radnor Friday night. I guess they wouldn't have liked anybody,  though, who come after Margaret. They thought nobody was good enough for  her.    \"But Margaret coaxed them all round in time. She could do pretty near  anything with them, they were so fond and proud of her. Her father held  out the longest, but finally he give in and consented for her to marry  Ronald Fraser.    \"They had a big wedding, too--all the neighbours were asked. Margaret  always liked to make a display. I was her bridesmaid, Master. I helped  her dress and nothing would please her; she wanted to look that nice  for Ronald's sake. She was a handsome bride; dressed in white, with red  roses in her hair and at her breast. She wouldn't wear white flowers;  she said they looked too much like funeral flowers. She looked like a  picture. I can see her this minute, as plain as plain, just as she was  that night, blushing and turning pale by turns, and looking at Ronald  with her eyes of love. If ever a girl loved a man with all her heart  Margaret Gordon did. It almost made me feel frightened. She gave him the  worship it isn't right to give anybody but God, Master, and I think that  is always punished.    \"They went to live at Radnor and for a little while everything went  well. Margaret had a nice house, and was gay and happy. She dressed  beautiful and entertained a good deal. Then--well, Ronald Fraser's first  wife turned up looking for him! She wasn't dead after all.    \"Oh, there was terrible scandal, Master. The talk and gossip was  something dreadful. Every one you met had a different story, and it was  hard to get at the truth. Some said Ronald Fraser had known all the time  that his wife wasn't dead, and had deceived Margaret. But I don't think  he did. He swore he didn't. They hadn't been very happy together, it  seems. Her mother made trouble between them. Then she went to visit her  mother in Montreal, and died in the hospital there, so the word came  to Ronald. Perhaps he believed it a little too readily, but that he DID  believe it I never had a doubt. Her story was that it was another woman  of the same name. When she found out Ronald thought her dead she and her  mother agreed to let him think so. But when she heard he had got married  again she thought she'd better let him know the truth.    \"It all sounded like a queer story and I suppose you couldn't blame  people for not believing it too readily. But I've always felt it was  true. Margaret didn't think so, though. She believed that Ronald Fraser  had deceived her, knowing all the time that he couldn't make her his  lawful wife. She turned against him and hated him just as much as she  had loved him before.    \"Ronald Fraser went away with his real wife, and in less than a year  word came of his death. They said he just died of a broken heart,  nothing more nor less.    \"Margaret came home to her father's house. From the day that she went  over its threshold, she never came out until she was carried out in her  coffin three years ago. Not a soul outside of her own family ever saw  her again. I went to see her, but Janet told me she wouldn't see me. It  was foolish of Margaret to act so. She hadn't done anything real wrong;  and everybody was sorry for her and would have helped her all they  could. But I reckon pity cut her as deep as blame could have done, and  deeper, because you see, Master, she was so proud she couldn't bear it.    \"They say her father was hard on her, too; and that was unjust if it was  true. Janet and Thomas felt the disgrace, too. The people that had been  in the habit of going to the Gordon place soon stopped going, for they  could see they were not welcome.    \"Old James Gordon died that winter. He never held his head up again  after the scandal. He had been an elder in the church, but he handed in  his resignation right away and nobody could persuade him to withdraw it.    \"Kilmeny was born in the spring, but nobody ever saw her, except the  minister who baptized her. She was never taken to church or sent to  school. Of course, I suppose there wouldn't have been any use in her  going to school when she couldn't speak, and it's likely Margaret taught  her all she could be taught herself. But it was dreadful that she was  never taken to church, or let go among the children and young folks.  And it was a real shame that nothing was ever done to find out why she  couldn't talk, or if she could be cured.    \"Margaret Gordon died three years ago, and everybody in Lindsay went to  the funeral. But they didn't see her. The coffin lid was screwed down.  And they didn't see Kilmeny either. I would have loved to see HER for  Margaret's sake, but I didn't want to see poor Margaret. I had never  seen her since the night she was a bride, for I had left Lindsay on a  visit just after that, and what I came home the scandal had just broken  out. I remembered Margaret in all her pride and beauty, and I couldn't  have borne to look at her dead face and see the awful changes I knew  must be there.    \"It was thought perhaps Janet and Thomas would take Kilmeny out after  her mother was gone, but they never did, so I suppose they must have  agreed with Margaret about the way she had been brought up. I've often  felt sorry for the poor girl, and I don't think her people did right by  her, even if she was mysteriously afflicted. She must have had a very  sad, lonely life.    \"That is the story, Master, and I've been a long time telling it, as I  dare say you think. But the past just seemed to be living again for  me as I talked. If you don't want to be pestered with questions about  Kilmeny Gordon, Master, you'd better not let on you've seen her.\"    Eric was not likely to. He had heard all he wanted to know and more.    \"So this girl is at the core of a tragedy,\" he reflected, as he went to  his room. \"And she is dumb! The pity of it! Kilmeny! The name suits her.  She is as lovely and innocent as the heroine of the old ballad. 'And  oh, Kilmeny was fair to see.' But the next line is certainly not so  appropriate, for her eyes were anything but 'still and steadfast'--after  she had seen me, at all events.\"    He tried to put her out of his thoughts, but he could not. The memory of  her beautiful face drew him with a power he could not resist. The next  evening he went again to the orchard.        CHAPTER VII. A ROSE OF WOMANHOOD    When he emerged from the spruce wood and entered the orchard his heart  gave a sudden leap, and he felt that the blood rushed madly to his face.  She was there, bending over the bed of June lilies in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53416"],[0,"Only a Girl's Love (#8)"],[1," returned to his face.    \"I was unhappy, uncle,\" she said, simply.    \"Unhappy!\" he echoed, gently--\"unhappy! My child, you are too young to  know what the word means. Tell me\"--and he put his long white hand on  her arm.    The touch was the one thing needed to draw them together. With a  sudden, yet not abrupt movement, she slid down at his side and leant  her head on his arm.    \"Yes, I was very unhappy, uncle. They were hard and unkind. They meant  well perhaps, but it was not to be borne. And then--then, after papa  died, it was so lonely, so lonely. There was no one--no one to care for  me--to care whether one lived or died. Uncle, I bore it as long as I  could, and then I--came.\"    The old man's eyes grew dim, and his hand rose gently to her head, and  smoothed the rich, silky hair.    \"Poor child! poor child!\" he murmured, dreamily, looking not at her,  but at the gloaming outside.    \"As long as I could, uncle, until I felt that I must run away, or  go mad, or die. Then I remembered you, I had never seen you, but I  remembered that you were papa's brother, and that, being of the same  blood, you must be good, and kind, and true; and so I resolved to come  to you.\"    His hand trembled on her head, but he was silent for a moment; then he  said, in a low voice:    \"Why did you not write?\"    A smile crossed the girl's face.    \"Because they would not permit us to write, excepting under their  dictation.\"    He started, and a fiery light flashed from the gentle, dreamy eyes.    \"No letters were allowed to leave the school unless the principals had  read them. We were never out alone, or I would have posted a letter  unknown to them. No, I could not write, or I would have done so,  and--and--waited.\"    \"You would not have waited long, my child,\" he murmured.    She threw back her head and kissed his hand. It was a strange gesture,  more foreign than English, full of the impulsive gracefulness of the  passionate South in which she had been born and bred; it moved the old  man strangely, and he drew her still closer to him as he whispered--    \"Go on!--go on!\"    \"Well I made up my mind to run away,\" she continued. \"It was a dreadful  thing to do, because if I had been caught and brought back, they would  have----\"    \"Stop, stop!\" he broke in with passionate dread. \"Why did I not know  of this? How did Harold come to send you there? Great Heaven! a young  tender girl! Can Heaven permit it?\"    \"Heaven permits strange things, uncle,\" said the girl, gravely. \"Papa  did not know, just as you did not know. It was an English school, and  all was fair and pleasant outside--outside! Well the night just after I  had received the money you used to send me each quarter, I bribed one  of the servants to leave the door open and ran away. I knew the road to  the coast and knew what day and time the boat started. I caught it and  reached London. There was just enough money to pay the fare down here,  and I--I--that is all, uncle.\"    \"All?\" he murmured. \"A young, tender child!\"    \"And are you not angry?\" she asked, looking up into his face. \"You will  not send me back?\"    \"Angry! Send you back! My child, do you think if I had known, if I  could have imagined that you were not well treated, that you were not  happy, that I would have permitted you to remain a day, an hour longer  than I could have helped? Your letters always spoke of your contentment  and happiness.\"    She smiled.    \"Remember, they were written with someone looking over my shoulder.\"    Something like an imprecation, surely the first that he had uttered for  many a long year, was smothered on the gentle lips.    \"I could not know that--I could not know that, Stella! Your father  thought it best--I have his last letter. My child, do not cry----\"    She raised her face.    \"I am not crying; I never cry when I think of papa, uncle, Why should  I? I loved him too well to wish him back from Heaven.\"    The old man looked down at her with a touch of awe in his eyes.    \"Yes, yes,\" he murmured; \"it was his wish that you should remain there  at school. He knew what I was, an aimless dreamer, a man living out of  the world, and no fit guardian for a young girl. Oh, yes, Harold knew.  He acted for the best, and I was content. My life was too lonely, and  quiet, and lifeless for a young girl, and I thought that all was right,  while those fiends----\"    She put her hand on his arm.    \"Do not let us speak of them, or think of them any more, uncle. You  will let me stay with you, will you not? I shall not think your life  lonely; it will be a Paradise after that which I have left--Paradise.  And, see, I will strive to make it less lonely; but\"--and she turned  suddenly with a look of troubled fear--\"but perhaps I shall be in your  way?\" and she looked round.    \"No, no,\" he said, and he put his hand to his brow. \"It is strange! I  never felt my loneliness till now! and I would not have you go for all  the world!\"    She wound her arms round him, and nestled closer, and there was silence  for a space; then he said:    \"How old are you, Stella?\"    She thought a moment.    \"Nineteen, uncle.\"    \"Nineteen--a child!\" he murmured; then he looked at her, and his lips  moved inaudibly as he thought, \"Beautiful as an angel,\" but she heard  him, and her face flushed, but the next moment she looked up frankly  and simply.    \"You would not say that much if you had seen my mamma. _She_ was  beautiful as an angel. Papa used to say that he wished you could  have seen her; that you would have liked to paint her. Yes, she was  beautiful.\"    The artist nodded.    \"Poor, motherless child!\" he murmured.    \"Yes, she was beautiful,\" continued the girl, softly. \"I can just  remember her, uncle. Papa never recovered from her death. He always  said that he counted the days till he should meet her again. He loved  her so, you see.\"    There was silence again; then the artist spoke:    \"You speak English with scarcely an accent, Stella.\"    The girl laughed; it was the first time she had laughed, and it caused  the uncle to start. It was not only because it was unexpected, but  because of its exquisite music. It was like the trill of a bird. In an  instant he felt that her childish sorrow had not imbittered her life or  broken her spirit. He found himself almost unconsciously laughing in  harmony.    \"What a strange observation, uncle!\" she said, when the laugh had died  away. \"Why I am English! right to the backbone, as papa used to say.  Often and often he used to look at me and say: 'Italy has no part and  parcel in you beyond your birth, Stella; you belong to that little  island which floats on the Atlantic and rules the world.' Oh, yes, I am  English. I should be sorry to be anything else, notwithstanding mamma  was an Italian.\"    He nodded.    \"Yes, I remember Harold--your father--always said you were an English  girl. I am glad of that.\"    \"So am I,\" said the girl, naively.    Then he relapsed into one of his dreamy silences, and she waited silent  and motionless. Suddenly he felt her quiver under his arm, and heave a  long, deep sigh.    With a start he looked down; her face had gone wofully pale to the very  lips.    \"Stella!\" he cried, \"what is it? Are you ill? Great Heaven!\"    She smiled up at him.    \"No, no, only a little tired; and,\" with naive simplicity, \"I think I  am a little hungry. You see, I only had enough for the fare.\"    \"Heaven forgive me!\" he cried, starting up so suddenly as almost to  upset her. \"Here have I been dreaming and mooning while the child was  starving. What a brainless idiot I am!\"    And in his excitement he hurried up and down the room, knocking over a  painting here and a lay figure there, and looking aimlessly about as if  he expected to see something in the shape of food floating in the air.    At last with his hand to his brow he bethought him of the bell, and  rang it until the little cottage resounded as if it were a fire-engine  station. There was a hurried patter of footsteps outside, the door was  suddenly opened, and a middle-aged woman ran in, with a cap very much  awry and a face startled and flushed.    \"Gracious me, sir, what's the matter?\" she exclaimed.    Mr. Etheridge dropped the bell, and without a word of explanation,  exclaimed--\"Bring something to eat at once, Mrs. Penfold, and some  wine, at once, please. The poor child is starving.\"    The woman looked at him with amazement, that increased as glancing  round the room she failed to see any poor child, Stella being hidden  behind the antique high-backed chair.    \"Poor child, what poor child! You've been dreaming, Mr. Etheridge!\"    \"No, no!\" he said, meekly; \"it's all true, Mrs. Penfold. She has come  all the way from Florence without a morsel to eat.\"    Stella rose from her ambush.    \"Not all the way from Florence, uncle,\" she said.    Mrs. Penfold started and stared at the visitor.    \"Good gracious me!\" she exclaimed; \"who is it?\"    Mr. Etheridge rubbed his brow.    \"Did I not tell you? It is my niece--my niece Stella. She has come  from Italy, and--I wish you'd bring some food. Bring a bottle of the  old wine. Sit down and rest, Stella. This is Mrs. Penfold--she is my  housekeeper, and a good woman, but,\"--he added, without lowering his  tone in the slightest, though he was evidently under the idea that he  was inaudible--\"but rather slow in comprehension.\"    Mrs. Penfold came forward, still flushed and excited, and with a smile.    \"Your niece, sir! Not Mr. Harold's daughter that you so often have  spoken of! Why, how did you come in, miss?\"    \"I found the door open,\" said Stella.    \"Good gracious me! And dropped from the clouds! And that must have  been an hour ago! And you, sir,\" looking at the bewildered artist  reproachfully, \"you let the dear young thing sit here with her hat and  jacket on all that time, after coming all that way, without sending for  me.\"    \"We didn't want you,\" said the old man, calmly.    \"Want me! No! But the dear child"]]]
