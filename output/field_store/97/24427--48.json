Come on, I say, and don't  go to sleep as you walk, you two.\"    So, worn and footsore, they moved on toward Cava.                                         CHAPTER V                                    AT CAVA      Pappina was unaccustomed to long walks. She felt lame, her flesh was  sore, and furthermore she could not forget Guiseppe's unkindness. It  hurt her that he had forced her to sing and dance for her food, and  then had scolded her for her lack of animation.    \"He said I was no better than his puppets. I hate him!\" she muttered  to herself as she trudged along in the growing dusk. \"That franc was  mine; that fine gentleman gave it to me. I wish I hadn't given it to  Guiseppe. It was mine. If any one gives me money again I'll keep it  for myself. I'll hide it away for Marta and me. Guiseppe may starve--I  shan't care. I hate him.\"    So the little girl was thinking all the way from Pagani to Cava. The  road was hard and rough. Occasionally Pappina, her aching feet hurt  by a sharp stone, would utter a little cry, \"_Ola_ [Oh]!\" as she  jumped aside, but except for these few exclamations there was complete  silence. Marta, in deep study, again and again stretched out her bony  hand and laid it caressingly on the head of the tired little girl  trudging uncomplainingly yet sullenly along the deserted road.    Guiseppe was determined to reach Cava that night. His snapping black  eyes looked keenly ahead for the spires and the lights of the village.    As he saw them dimly in the distance he inwardly rejoiced that the  day's tramp was almost over. A half-mile from the village he halted  beneath a large tree which protectingly spread its branches beside the  road.    He leaned the Punchinello box against the trunk of the tree and, still  without speaking, threw himself on the ground.    In spite of her fatigue, Pappina stood with her hands clasped, looking  at the distant lights of Cava. Marta, rolling together her apron and  her shawl as a pillow for Pappina's head, watched the child and waited  for her to speak or move. Pappina did neither.    \"She is such a tired little girl,\" Marta said after a few moments, as  she took Pappina gently by the hand. \"_Vieni, carina, resta_ [rest].\"    For a moment Pappina hung back, then she clung to Marta in the dark and  whispered: \"For you, Marta, for you, because you are good to me.\"    Marta took the child in her arms and carried her to a resting-place.  She kissed the little hand, her whole heart going out to Pappina  in love and compassion as she blessed her with the words \"_Dio vi  benedica. Buona notte, carissima_ [God bless you. Good-night, dearest].\"    Only Guiseppe rested well. Marta felt too keenly the wrong done Pappina  to sleep at all.    \"He'll kill the baby,\" her thoughts ran. \"He shows her no mercy. Oh!  what can I do? There'll be trouble--I feel it, I know it. I must  protect her. How sweet, how patient, how gentle she is when he is good  to her!\"    Marta heard the deep breathing of Guiseppe sleeping, heard Pappina  muttering in her disturbed slumber: \"I hate him! I hate him!\"    Guiseppe was awake at the first peep of day. Seeing Marta bending over  Pappina, he commanded her: \"Shake the willful child; bid her get up at  once. It's fete day.\"    Marta during her night's revery had determined to protect Pappina at  any cost to herself, so she pleaded for the child:    \"Yes, Guiseppe, it is fete day, and for that reason you had better let  Pappina rest for a little while. She is exhausted from her long tramp  yesterday. She will have much excitement, singing and dancing all day,  even late in the evening. We can find our breakfast and I will bring  Pappina's to her. Let her rest, I pray you, Guiseppe; let her rest.\"    Marta stood before her husband, her worn face shining with earnestness.  Guiseppe looked at her in surprise; then laughed brutally.    \"Bravo, Marta!\" he cried. \"I didn't know you had it in you. You want  the child to sleep, eh?\" Then closing his eyes just a little, like a  tiger before he springs, he went on: \"So you will not awaken her? Then  it is Guiseppe, the tyrant--eh, Marta?--who must rudely arouse the  sleeping princess from her morning slumber.\"    As he finished speaking he moved toward Pappina, who was tossing  restlessly on her hard couch, but Marta sprang between him and the  child.    \"Guiseppe, I have always obeyed you, have I not?\" she entreated in a  low voice. \"Look at Pappina: her restlessness shows how tired she is.  Guiseppe, hear me! I beg you to let her sleep and be rested for her  hard day's work.\" Marta leaned forward and placed her hands on the  man's arm as she went on: \"I have asked few favors, demanded none, but  now for this once, Guiseppe, I pray you grant me my request! Let her  rest!\"    Guiseppe, hesitating, ran his hand several times through his black hair  as he looked from Marta to Pappina, still asleep on the ground. He knit  his brow, struggling with himself as though it were a hardship to grant  his wife a favor.    \"Guiseppe,\" Marta bravely began again, but he interrupted her.    \"Come on,\" he said roughly. \"I'll humor you this time. I'll let her  sleep.\"    So it came about that Pappina awoke under the big tree in the early  morning sun to find herself alone. Suddenly a great fear seized her.  Perhaps Marta and Guiseppe had gone off and left her. She sprang up  and ran to the road, looking wildly about for them. In her terror she  did not notice the Punchinello box leaning against the tree, and she  started toward the village, crying aloud: \"Marta, Marta!\"    Her tears flowed freely, and between her sobs she continued to cry  for Marta and occasionally for Guiseppe. It was with Guiseppe's name  half-spoken on her lips that the little frightened child stopped  crying.    \"Guiseppe! Gui--oh! I hate him! I hate him more than I did last night!\"  The memory of how he had treated her the day before came over her like  a flood. \"It is fete day at Cava; he said so. All I earn is mine, and  when I sing the Garibaldi I shall have my tambourine full of money. Oh,  how glad I am! Then I can go home.\"    As she hurried on, her plan grew clearer. She would strike out for  herself. Then suddenly she stopped again, like a butterfly halted and  shifted in its course by a vagrant wind.    \"Oh, Marta! If you were only with me, I should not care,\" she sobbed.    Buffeted by conflicting feelings, Pappina sped on toward the village of  Cava.    Marta ate but little. She started back to find Pappina, leaving  Guiseppe to finish his breakfast alone.    \"She'll like what I have brought her,\" she took pleasure in thinking as  she approached the spot where they had camped for the night. She saw no  signs of Pappina astir. \"She's still asleep, tired out, poor baby! I'm  so glad Guiseppe let her rest.\"    She smiled on the friendly tree as she neared its welcome shade. She  peeped around the trunk; no one was there. Down went the bowl of milk  with a crash to the ground.    \"Pappina gone!\" She stood speechless and terrified. Recovering herself,  she ran through the bushes, crying: \"Pappina, Pappina, Pappina! Where  are you, _carina_?\"    No answer came to her cries.    \"Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do?\" she moaned as she ran to and  fro, wringing her hands. \"What will Guiseppe say? How can I tell him  Pappina is gone? He'll say it is all my fault. How can I endure his  rage and disappointment? And my Pappina!--oh, I should not care for  Guiseppe's anger if I knew she was safe.\"    Poor Marta! For the first time in years she gave way to tears. Her  whole frame shook with sobs.    Guiseppe, meanwhile, having finished his meal, was growing impatient at  Marta's delay. The streets were filling with people.    \"What detains them?\" he asked himself. Then the thought occurred to  him that perhaps Marta's warning had come true and the child was sick  again. \"God forbid that she is ill!\" the man ejaculated as he piously  crossed himself.    He heard the sound of the bugle calling the soldiers for drill. Priests  and children were assembling for the march into church. Women and men  in festival garb were hastening to mass. Bands, boys, and venders  were everywhere. Guiseppe paced impatiently up and down, growing more  nervous every moment. Then another thought came to him:    \"Perhaps they've forgotten I'm waiting. Marta may have forgotten. She's  getting to be a bigger fool every day over that headstrong child. Well,  the minx certainly has grit, and such spirit! _Per bacco!_ She's lamb  and tigress combined. If she were like other children I could beat her,  but--well, I'll be hanged if I could beat Pappina!\"    Guiseppe's anxiety was increasing every second. \"The crowds are even  now going to mass,\" he muttered. \"I'll go and meet them.\" He started  with rapid strides toward the spot where the three of them had spent  the night. He halted on hearing Marta's sobs. A great fear overcame  him; then, recovering himself, he rushed on like a madman toward the  tree where Marta sat, sobbing in her grief and fear. He took in the  situation at once.    \"What!\" he exclaimed, \"Pappina not here! Where is she?\"    He stood dazed. The calamity of losing Pappina on fete day crushed him.  Then, arousing himself, he shook Marta roughly by the shoulder and  showered imprecations upon her.    \"You fool! You dog! And to-day is fete day. You're in league with the  little imp against me.\"    \"Oh, Guiseppe--\"    \"Don't speak to me! I humored you, and what do I get in return? You  rob me of my living. Thief! Snake!\" In his anger he kicked over the  Punchinello box. \"And I've only these poor puppets left,\" he cried.    \"Guiseppe, have pity!\" Marta begged, shrinking as far away"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45573"],[0,"Out with Garibaldi: A story of the liberation of Italy (#8)"],[1,"merely been taking a walk in the country. Ten  minutes later they entered the lodging that Madame Forli had taken,  after staying for a few days at an hotel. Great indeed was the joy which  their arrival excited. The two ladies had been suffering terrible  anxiety since the fighting began at Rome, and especially since it was  known that the French had obtained possession of one of the gates, and  that a fierce struggle was going on. They were sure their husbands would  keep their promise to leave the city when the situation became  desperate; but it was too likely that Captain Percival might have  fallen, for it was certain that he would be in the thick of the fighting  by the side of Garibaldi. It was, then, with rapturous delight that they  were greeted, and it was found that both were unharmed.    It was at once decided to start by a steamer that would leave the next  day. Both the ladies possessed passports: Muriel that which had been  made out for her husband and herself on their return from their visit to  England; while her mother had one which the professor had obtained for  both of them when the troubles first began, and he foresaw that it was  probable he might have to leave the country. Therefore no difficulty was  experienced on this score; and when the party went on board the next day  the documents were stamped without any questions being asked. Not the  least delighted among them to quit Leghorn was Frank, who was now four  years old. He had found it dull indeed in their quiet lodging at  Leghorn, and missed his father greatly, and his grandfather also, for  the professor was almost as fond of the child as its parents.    There were but few passengers besides themselves, for in the disturbed  state of Italy, and, indeed, of all Europe, there were very few English  tourists in 1848; and even those who permanently resided in Italy had  for the most part left. The passengers, therefore, were, with the  exception of the two ladies and Captain Percival, all Italians, who  were, like Signor Forli, leaving because they feared that the liberal  opinions they had ventured to express--when it seemed that with the  accession of a liberal pontiff to the papal chair better times were  dawning for Italy--would bring them into trouble now it was but too  evident that the reign of despotism was more firmly established than  ever.    The steamer touched at Genoa, and here the greater portion of her  passengers left, among them Professor Forli's party. They took train to  Milan, where they stopped for a few days, crossed the Alps by the St.  Gothard's Pass, spent a fortnight in Switzerland, and then journeyed  through Bale, down the Rhine to Cologne, and thence to England. They  were in no hurry, for time was no object to any of them, as they were  well supplied with money; and after the excitement and trouble of the  last few months, the quiet and absence of all cause for uneasiness was  very pleasant to them. On their arrival at Tom Percival's town residence  in Cadogan Place sad news awaited them. Only a fortnight before, his  yacht had been run down at sea, and he and the greater part of the crew  had perished.          CHAPTER III.    TROUBLES.      The death of Tom Percival naturally made a great difference to his  brother's position. He was now a large land-owner, with a fine place in  the country and a house in town. The next nine years of his life were  unmarked by any particular incident. Signor Forli and his wife were  permanently established in Cadogan Place. The professor had never been  accustomed to a country life, and in London he was able to indulge in  all his former pursuits. He had always laid by a certain amount of his  income, and could have lived in some comfort in London, as until the  troubles began he had received, in addition to his modest salary as a  professor, the rents of a property he possessed near Naples, of which  place he was a native. But neither Captain Percival nor his wife would  hear of his setting up an establishment of his own.    \"We shall not be up in town above three months of the year at the  outside,\" the former said; \"and of course Muriel will always want to  have you with us for that time, for I know very well that you will  seldom tear yourself from your work and come down and stay with us in  the country. It will be far better for us that the house shall be always  used, instead of being left for nine months in the year to caretakers.  You can fit up the library with cases for your coins and manuscripts.  You have already made the acquaintance of many of the scientific and  learned men you formerly corresponded with, and will soon get a very  pleasant society of your own. It will be better in all respects. You can  shut up the rooms you don't use, while the servants whom I keep to look  after the house must in any case be told to consider you as their  master; and you can, if you choose, get a couple of Italian servants as  your own special domestics.\" And so, after much argument, it was  settled, and for some years things went on to the satisfaction of all.    When ten years old Frank was sent to a preparatory school for Harrow,  and three years later to the great school itself. Just at this time the  professor determined to pay a visit to Italy. Since the fall of Rome  everything had gone on quietly there; and although persons suspected of  liberal ideas had been seized and thrown into prison without any public  inquiry, he considered that now that he had been settled in England for  years, and had become a naturalised British subject, he could without  any risk go over to make an effort to obtain a reversal of the  confiscation of his property in the Neapolitan territory. Before  starting he had called upon the official representative of the  Neapolitan government, and had been assured by him that his passport as  a British subject would be respected, and that if he refrained from  taking any part in politics he could travel in King Ferdinand's  territories without any fear of his movements being in any way  interfered with.    Up to this time Captain Percival and his wife had been strongly against  the proposed visit, but after the professor had received this official  assurance they believed with him that he could in perfect safety  undertake the journey. He wrote on his arrival at Naples, stating that  he had, as soon as he landed, called upon one of the ministers, and  reported to him the assurance that the envoy in London had given him,  and had been told that, while expressing no opinion upon the probability  of his obtaining a reversal of the confiscation of his estate, there  could be no objection whatever to his endeavouring to do so, but that he  did not think the government would authorise his establishing himself  permanently in the kingdom, as his well-known political opinions would  naturally render him obnoxious. He had given his assurance that he had  no intention whatever of remaining beyond the time necessary for the  purpose for which he had come; that he had now permanently settled in  England, and had only come over for the purpose that he had specified;  and that on no account would he hold any political discussions with such  personal friends as he had in Italy, or give any expression whatever of  his own views. He wrote that, as he had said before starting, he did not  intend to call upon any of his former acquaintances, as, if he did so,  it might bring them into discredit with the government.    No other letter was received from him. After waiting for three weeks,  Captain Percival wrote to the proprietor of the hotel from which the  previous letter was dated, asking if he was still there, and if not, if  he was aware of his present address. The answer was received in due  time, saying that Professor Forli had gone out one morning, a week after  his arrival, with the intention, he believed, of visiting his former  estate, but that he had not returned. Two days later a person had  arrived bearing a letter from him, saying that he had changed his plans  and should not return to Naples, and requesting that his luggage and  all personal effects should be handed over to the bearer, who would  discharge the amount owing for his bill. He had complied with the  request, and had since received no communication from Professor Forli.  Captain Percival went at once to call upon the minister for foreign  affairs, stated the whole circumstances to him, and the assurance that  the professor had received from the Neapolitan envoy before starting,  and said that he felt sure that, in spite of his assurance and the  protection of his passport as a British subject, his father-in-law had  been seized and thrown into prison.    \"If that is the case, a serious wrong has been committed,\" the minister  said. \"But we cannot assume that without some proof. He may have been  seized by some brigands, who by a ruse have obtained possession of his  effects; possibly the person now in possession of the estate, fearing  that he might be ousted from it, has taken these means for suppressing a  claimant who might be dangerous. However, what you have told me is  sufficient for me to commence action, by making a complaint to the  Neapolitan government that a British subject, duly furnished with a  passport, is missing, and requesting that measures shall at once be  taken to ascertain what has become of him.\"    Correspondence went on for three or four months, the Neapolitan  government protesting that they had made inquiries in every direction,  but had obtained no clue whatever as to Professor Forli's movements from  the time when he left his hotel, and disclaiming any knowledge whatever  of him. It was now January 1858, and Lord Palmerston, who was then prime  minister, took the case up warmly, and Captain Percival had several  interviews with him.    \"I quite agree with you, sir,\" the minister said, \"that he is probably  in a Neapolitan dungeon; but at present "]]]
