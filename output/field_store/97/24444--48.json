Smith (#8)"],[1,"name would soon have been  buried with his body in the grave to perish and be forgotten, \"for  as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the  dead.\" But the most glorious part of his mission had to be accomplished  after the crucifixion and death of his body. When on the first day  of the week some of the disciples went to the tomb with certain  preparations for the body of their Lord, they were met there by two men  clothed in \"shining garments,\" who said unto them, \"Why seek ye the  living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he  spoke unto you when he was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of Man must  be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the  third day rise again.\" And not until then did the disciples remember  these words of the Savior, or begin to understand their meaning. Why  were they thus forgetful and seemingly ignorant of all they had been  taught by the Savior respecting the objects of his mission to the  earth? Because they lacked one important qualification, they had not  yet been \"endowed with power from on high.\" They had not yet obtained  the gift of the {25} Holy Ghost. And the presumption is, they never  would have received this important and essential endowment had Christ's  mission been completed at the time of his death.    It may seem strange to some who may not have reflected on this  matter fully, that the disciples of Christ were without the gift of  the Holy Ghost until after his resurrection. But so it is written,  notwithstanding the Savior on one occasion declared, \"blessed art thou  Simon, etc., for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but  my Father which is in heaven.\" While Jesus was with them he was their  light and their inspiration. They followed him by sight, and felt the  majestic power of his presence, and when these were gone they returned  to their nets and to their various occupations and to their homes  saying, \"we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed  Israel, but the chief priests and our rulers have delivered him to  be condemned to death, and have crucified him.\" No wonder that Jesus  exclaimed unto some of them, \"O fools, and slow of heart to believe all  that the prophets have spoken.\"    If the disciples had been endowed with the \"gift of the Holy Ghost,\"  or \"with power from on high,\" at this time, their course would have  been altogether different from this, as the sequel abundantly proved.  If Peter, who was the chief apostle, had received the gift of the  Holy Ghost, and the power and testimony thereof prior to the terrible  night on which he cursed and swore and denied his Lord, the result  would have been very different with him, for then he would have sinned  against \"light and knowledge,\" and \"against the Holy Ghost,\" for which  there is no forgiveness. The fact, therefore, that he was forgiven,  after bitter tears of repentance, is an evidence that he was without  the witness of the Holy Ghost, never having received it. The other  disciples or apostles of Christ were precisely in the same condition,  and it was not until the evening of the day on which Jesus came out of  the grave that he bestowed upon {26} them this inestimable gift. John  gives a careful description of this important event which concludes  as follows: \"Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my  Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he had said this,  he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:  whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them,\" etc. This was  their glorious commission, and now were they prepared to receive the  witness of the Spirit--even the testimony of Jesus Christ. Yet they  were told to tarry in Jerusalem, until they were endued with power  from on high, which they did. Jesus further told them that if he went  not away the \"Comforter\"--that is, the Holy Ghost--would not come unto  them, but if he went away he would \"send him,\" and he it was who should  testify of Christ, and of the Father, and bring to their remembrance  \"all things whatsoever\" he had commanded or taught them, and it should  \"lead them into all truth.\" Thus we see that the resurrection from the  dead, not only of Christ, but of all mankind, in the due time of the  Lord; the endowment of the apostles with the Holy Ghost, and their  glorious commission from Christ, being sent out by him as he was sent  by the Father; the opening of the eyes of the disciples to understand  the prophecies of the Scriptures, and many other things did Jesus after  he cried out upon the cross, \"it is finished.\" Further, the mission  of Jesus will be unfinished until he redeems the whole human family,  except the sons of perdition, and also this earth from the curse that  is upon it and both the earth and its inhabitants can be presented to  the Father redeemed, sanctified and glorious.    Things upon the earth, so far as they have not been perverted by  wickedness, are typical of things in heaven. Heaven was the prototype  of this beautiful creation when it came from the hand of the Creator,  and was pronounced \"good.\"--_Journal of Discourses,_ Vol. 23 (1883),  pp. 169-175, delivered June 18, 1882.    {27} MAN ETERNALLY RESPONSIBLE. Man will be held responsible in the  life to come for the deeds that he has done in this life, and will  have to answer for the stewardships entrusted to his care here, before  the judge of the quick and the dead, the Father of our spirits, and of  our Lord and Master. This is the design of God, a part of his great  purpose. We are not here to live a few months or years, to eat, drink  and sleep, then to die, pass away and perish. The Lord Almighty never  designed man to be so ephemeral, useless and imperfect as this. I  would pity the being who had such a conception as this of the Creator  of the starry heavens, the planets, and the world on which we dwell,  poor as it is in glory in comparison to the many others created. Is  it conceivable that one possessing such power, majesty, intelligence,  light and knowledge would create a world like this and people it with  beings in his own image and likeness only to live and grovel through a  short, miserable existence, then die and perish? No such thing! There  is no death here, but there is life!    God is the God of the living, and not of the dead. He is the God of  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and of the ancient prophets. They live!  They live not only in the words they spoke, the predictions they  made, and in the promises handed down from generation to generation  to the children of men; they live not only in the record they made,  in the doctrines that they taught, and in the hope that they held out  for redemption, atonement and salvation, but they live in spirit, in  entity, as they lived here. They are prophets, as they were prophets  here, the chosen of God; patriarchs, as they were here; possessing  the same identity, the same entity; and by and by, if not already,  they will possess the same bodies they possessed while journeying  in mortality. Those bodies will become purified, cleansed, and made  perfect; and the spirit and the body will be reunited, never more to be  separated, never again to taste of death. This is the law {28} and the  promise of God, and the words spoken to his ancient prophets, come down  to us through the generations that have followed.--_Improvement Era,_  Vol. 21, p. 357, Feb., 1918.    OUR INDESTRUCTIBLE, IMMORTAL IDENTITY. What a glorious thing it is  to know and be true to that which has been revealed in these latter  times through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. It was  revealed anciently by the Savior himself, and he exemplified that  glorious principle of which I wish to say a few words, and which has  been renewed and emphasized more especially in these latter days  through Joseph Smith--I refer to our identity, our indestructible,  immortal identity. As in Christ we have the example, he was born of  woman, he lived, he died, and he lived again in his own person and  being, bearing even the marks of the wounds in his flesh, after his  resurrection from the dead--so also a testimony has been given to you,  in later days, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and others who have  been blessed with knowledge, that the same individual Being still  lives and will always live. Jesus is possessed of immortality, and  eternal life; and in evidence of his existence and his immortality, and  in evidence of the great and glorious truths of the gospel which he  taught, the death which he died, and the resurrection that he wrought  from the dead, he has revealed himself and borne his own record and  testimony to those who have lived and still live in this day and age.  What a glorious thought it is, to me at least, and it must be to all  who have conceived of the truth or received it in their hearts, that  those from whom we have to part here, we will meet again and see as  they are. We will meet the same identical being that we associated  with here in the flesh--not some other soul, some other being, or  the same being in some other form, but the same identity and the same  form and likeness, the same person we knew and were associated with in  our mortal existence, even to the {29} wounds in the flesh. Not that  a person will always be marred by scars, wounds, deformities, defects  or infirmities, for these will be removed in their course, in their  proper time, according to the merciful providence of God. Deformity  will be removed; defects will be eliminated, and men and women shall  attain to the perfection of their spirits, to the perfection that God  designed in the beginning. It is his purpose that men and women, his  children, born to become heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus  Christ, shall be made perfect, physically as well as spiritually,  through obedience to the law by which he has provided the means that  perfection shall "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47132"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 7 (of 8) (#8)"],[1,"principle, was drawn up, and the organisation of the civil  police taken in hand. The Imperial authorities were engaged in a  scheme for restocking the country after the war by establishing stock  depots on the Government farms in both the Transvaal and Orange  River.    [Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL CHARLES KNOX.    Photo Elliott & Fry, London.]      LYTTELTON'S SWEEPING MOVEMENT--10TH TO 20TH MARCH--THABANCHU LINE    The enemy, under the direction of Fourie, in many small gangs of from  two to four hundred, still hovered in the region between the Orange  River and the Thabanchu-Ladybrand line. With the object of sweeping  them up, General Lyttelton organised a combined northward movement  which began on the 10th of March. General Bruce-Hamilton's columns,  under Lieutenant-Colonels Monro, Maxwell, and White pushed up from  Aliwal North, Colonel Hickman and Lieutenant-Colonel Thorneycroft  moved out from Bethulie and Springfontein respectively, prolonging the  line on the left to the railway, while Colonel Haig's troops advanced  from Edenburg. Later on, as the columns swept upwards, Colonel  Bethune's Brigade took its place in the scheme, filling the gap  between Leeuw Kop and Boesman's Kop, with its right flank resting on  the Kaffir River. While these were marching up, the line of posts from  Bloemfontein _via_ Thabanchu to the Basutoland border was temporarily  reinforced by Colonel Harley, who, with some 200 mounted men, two  guns, and a battalion, had been detached from the portion of General  Rundle's force which was holding Ficksburg. The road still further  north, near Houtnek, was watched by Colonel Pilcher to guard against  hostile movement in that region. The combined advance, though there  was little fighting, was decidedly successful. Heavy stocks of grain  were found, and such as could not be accommodated in the British  waggons were destroyed. Though, as usual, the Boers were dispersed in  driblets and most of the farms were deserted and the property  abandoned, some of their number got caught in the meshes of the  military net. Colonel Pilcher's men succeeded in securing some  thirty-three Boers and about 3000 horses, and the total haul of the  columns on reaching the Thabanchu line on the 20th amounted to 70  prisoners, 4300 horses, and many trek oxen. After this date General  Bruce-Hamilton's force and that of Colonel Hickman disposed themselves  between Wepener and Dewetsdorp, while Colonel Haig was ordered to keep  his eye on rambling raiders from Cape Colony, in the region of the  Caledon. Colonel Bethune's Brigade, marching north _via_ Winburg and  Ventersburg, soon swelled the mounted force of some 7000 men, being  organised at Kroonstad (under the command of General Elliot), and  Colonel Thorneycroft, now under orders of General C. Knox, took up a  position at Brandfort. This place at that time was somewhat harassed  by meandering marauders, who were in the habit of taking up a nightly  post on a hill near by. These were surprised by the mounted infantry  and burgher police, and their number considerably thinned.    [Illustration: OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTH-EAST OF THE ORANGE RIVER  COLONY]    From all points the clearance of the Colony was pursued with vigour.  On the 24th Colonel White, in the Thabanchu region, surprised parties  of Boers, capturing six waggons, thirty-four horses, and some cattle,  and on the 25th some smart work was done by a detachment of Lancers,  Yeomanry, and Rimington's Guides, who drove off and dispersed various  portions of Fourie's commando without loss to themselves. At this time  Fourie, Joubert, Pretorius, and Coetzee had been all hanging about the  neighbourhood of Dewetsdorp, and on the 25th and 26th some spirited  encounters took place between them and Captain Damant, who, with some  of Rimington's Scouts, engaged in many perilous excursions. On the  27th General Bruce-Hamilton, with Hickman's column and Rimington's  Scouts, moved out with a view to clearing off the snipers that  fringed the surrounding hills. The Scouts and the Lancaster Mounted  Infantry routed the Boers from one position after another, chasing  them for miles as far as Blesbokfontein, where they dispersed.  Meanwhile on the left, near Byersberg, our troops had discovered the  Boer laager, whereupon Rimington's Scouts rode round the position,  driving the enemy, who scampered from their concealment in the ridges,  in a south-westerly direction. Owing to the exhaustion of the horses  the pursuit could not be continued, but the troops returned to camp  with a goodly show of horses, cattle, and Cape carts as a prize for  their endurance.    Concurrently with the activities in the south-east of the Orange River  Colony, in the region of Winburg and Heilbron, good work had been  going forward. Colonel Williams and Major Pine Coffin, working in  combination, had cleared the Doornberg, a supply depot, which, owing  to De Wet's absence, was but weakly guarded. All stock was removed,  and during the operations General P. Botha and seven Boers were killed  and many were taken prisoners. Colonel Williams and the combined  forces, reinforced by Major Massy's column from Edenburg, now took up  a position near the Vet and Zand Rivers, in order to catch De Wet  should he break northward. But as this leader was now in hiding,  \"taking a breather\" for fresh nimbleness in future, it was found  unnecessary to wait there, and the column moved on towards Heilbron.  Here, accompanied by a detachment from the garrison under Major  Weston, Colonel Williams continued his work of clearance, fighting  betimes, and capturing grain, forage, foodstuffs, and ammunition in  great quantities. Colonel Williams then moved to the north of  Heilbron, performing the same task of clearance between the Wilge  River and the main line of rail. This occupation took him well into  April, of which month more anon.           *       *       *       *       *    During the middle of March Lord Kitchener engaged himself with the  rearrangement of the mobile columns in the Orange River Colony,  dividing the place into four military districts. Each district was  placed under the control of a General Officer, whose duty it was to  deal with any encroachments of the enemy, to prevent the concentration  of commandos, and to clear the country of horses and cattle, and any  supplies which might stimulate the marauders to new exertion. The  southern district, bounded on the south by the Orange River, on the  north by the line Petrusburg-Ladybrand, on the west by the Kimberley  Railway, on the east by Basutoland, was entrusted to General  Lyttelton, his force including the columns of General Bruce-Hamilton  and Colonels Hickman and Haig.    The central district, bounded on the south by General Lyttelton's  command, on the north by the Bultfontein-Winburg-Ficksburg line,  extending to Boshof, was assigned to General C. Knox, with whom were  the columns of Colonels Pilcher and Thorneycroft.    The northern district, including part of Orange River Colony north  of General C. Knox's command, bounded on the east by the  Frankfort-Reitz-Bethlehem line, was allotted to General Elliot,  whose troops consisted of Colonel Bethune's Cavalry Brigade, Colonel  de Lisle's Column (withdrawn from Cape Colony), and General  Broadwood's Brigade, composed of 7th Dragoon Guards, three  battalions Imperial Yeomanry, and six guns.    [Illustration: REORGANISATION OF TROOPS IN THE ORANGE RIVER COLONY]    The eastern district, as before, remained in charge of General Rundle,  who, with the original 8th Division and some Mounted Infantry and  Yeomanry, protected the line Frankfort-Reitz-Bethlehem-Ficksburg.    By the end of March recruiting for General Baden-Powell's Police  ceased. The work of training, clothing, mounting, and equipping was  carried on with all speed, and the recruits who arrived from England  promptly displayed their grit and their zeal by withstanding the  assaults of the Boers, who invariably attacked such districts as they  fancied were in charge of the \"raw\" element. The new-comers were no  fledgelings, however, for the members of the Constabulary were mostly  gentlemen or farmers of a high class, selected with a view to making  good colonists.          CHAPTER II    CAPE COLONY--PURSUIT OF RAIDERS--MARCH AND APRIL--CHASING KRUITZINGER      While the pursuit of De Wet was going forward, our troops under  General Settle, and subsequently under Colonel Douglas Haig (Colonels  Henniker, Gorringe, Grenfell, Scobell, and Crewe), worked unceasingly  against the Boer raiders who were making themselves obstreperous in  various parts of the Colony. Pearston was occupied by seven hundred of  the enemy with two guns, who captured sixty rifles and 15,000 rounds  of ammunition, in spite of the gallant defence of the tiny garrison.  The invaders, a part of Kruitzinger's commando, were promptly swept  away by Colonel Gorringe, who reoccupied the place on the 5th, and  caused the fugitives to be pursued. Accordingly the commando broke  into three parties and fled eastward over the railway.    About the same time one hundred raiders, under Scheepers, made a  desperate attack upon the village of Aberdeen--an attack which happily  failed owing to the smartness of the garrison. This consisted of a  portion of the 4th Derbyshire Militia, Town Guard, and twenty men of  the 9th Lancers, under Colonel Priestly. The Boers, however, succeeded  in penetrating into the town, and releasing some of their compatriots  who were in gaol. They further tried to loot the stores, but were not  given the opportunity, so promptly did the Town Guard send them to the  right-about. Colonel Parsons arrived on the scene in the afternoon,  followed, the next day, by Colonel Scobell and some Colonials, and  soon, though not without sharp fighting, the kopjes surrounding the  place were purged of the raiders. The sharpshooters of the Imperial  Yeomanry under Major Warden were"]]]
