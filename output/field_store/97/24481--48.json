Nothing can  alter the fact that, the very moment woman resorts to violence, she  places herself within the jurisdiction of an ethical law, which is as  old as civilisation, and which was framed in its interests.

II    WOMAN'S DISABILITY IN THE MATTER OF INTELLECT    Characteristics of the Feminine Mind--Suffragist Illusions with Regard  to the Equality of Man and Woman as Workers--Prospect for the  Intellectual Future of Woman--Has Woman Advanced?    The woman voter would be pernicious to the State not only because she  could not back her vote by physical force, but also by reason of her  intellectual defects.    Woman's mind attends in appraising a statement primarily to the mental  images which it evokes, and only secondarily--and sometimes not at  all--to what is predicated in the statement. It is over-influenced by  individual instances; arrives at conclusions on incomplete evidence;  has a very imperfect sense of proportion; accepts the congenial as  true, and rejects the uncongenial as false; takes the imaginary which  is desired for reality, and treats the undesired reality which is out  of sight as non-existent--building up for itself in this way, when  biased by predilections and aversions, a very unreal picture of the  external world.    The explanation of this is to be found in all the physiological  attachments of woman's mind:[1] in the fact that mental images are in  her over-intimately linked up with emotional reflex responses; that  yielding to such reflex responses gives gratification; that  intellectual analysis and suspense of judgment involve an inhibition  of reflex responses which is felt as neural distress; that precipitate  judgment brings relief from this physiological strain; and that woman  looks upon her mind not as an implement for the pursuit of truth, but  as an instrument for providing her with creature comforts in the form  of agreeable mental images.    [1] Certain of these have already been referred to in the letter printed  in the Appendix (_ vide_ p.167 _infra_).    In order to satisfy the physical yearning for such comforts, a  considerable section of intelligent and virtuous women insist on  picturing to themselves that the reign of physical force is over, or as  good as over; that distinctions based upon physical and intellectual force  may be reckoned as non-existent; that male supremacy as resting upon these  is a thing of the past; and that Justice means Egalitarian Equity--means  equating the weaklings with the strong and the incapable with the capable.    All this because these particular ideas are congenial to the woman of  refinement, and because it is to her, when she is a suffragist,  uncongenial that there should exist another principle of justice which  demands from the physically and intellectually capable that they shall  retain the reins of government in their own hands; and specially  uncongenial that in all man-governed States the ideas of justice of  the more forceful should have worked out so much to the advantage of  women, that a large majority of these are indifferent or actively  hostile to the Woman's Suffrage Movement.    In further illustration of what has been said above, it may be pointed  out that woman, even intelligent woman, nurses all sorts of  misconceptions about herself. She, for instance, is constantly  picturing to herself that she can as a worker lay claim to the same  all-round efficiency as a man--forgetting that woman is notoriously  unadapted to tasks in which severe physical hardships have to be  confronted; and that hardly any one would, if other alternative  offered, employ a woman in any work which imposed upon her a combined  physical and mental strain, or in any work where emergencies might  have to be faced.    In like manner the suffragist is fond of picturing to herself that  woman is for all ordinary purposes the intellectual equal, and that  the intelligent woman is the superior of the ordinary man.    These results are arrived at by fixing the attention upon the fact  that an ordinary man and an ordinary woman are, from the point of view  of memory and apprehension, very much on a level; and that a highly  intelligent woman has a quicker memory and a more rapid power of  apprehension than the ordinary man; and further, by leaving out of  regard that it is not so much a quick memory or a rapid power of  apprehension which is required for effective intellectual work, as  originality, or at any rate independence of thought, a faculty of  felicitious generalisations and diacritical judgment, long-sustained  intellectual effort, an unselective mirroring of the world in the  mind, and that relative immunity to fallacy which goes together with a  stable and comparatively unresponsive nervous system.    When we consider that the intellect of the quite ungifted man works  with this last-mentioned physiological advantage, we can see that the  male intellect must be, and--_pace [with the permission of]_ the woman  suffragist--it in point of fact is, within its range, a better  instrument for dealing with the practical affairs of life than that of  the intelligent woman.    How far off we are in the case of woman from an unselective mirroring  of the world in the mind is shown by the fact that large and important  factors of life may be represented in woman's mind by lacunae [gaps]  of which she is totally unconscious.    Thus, for instance, that not very unusual type of spinster who is in a  condition of retarded development (and you will find this kind of  woman even on County Council's), is completely unconscious of the  sexual element in herself and in human nature generally. Nay, though  one went from the dead, he could not bring it home to her that  unsatisfied sexuality is an intellectual disability.    Sufficient illustration will now have been given of woman's incapacity  to take a complete or objective view of any matter in which she has a  personal, or any kind of emotional interest; and this would now be the  place to discuss those other aspects of her mind which are relevant to  her claim to the suffrage. I refer to her logical endowment and her  political sagacity.    All that I might have been required to say here on these issues has,  however, already been said by me in dealing with the arguments of the  suffragist. I have there carefully written it in between the lines.    One thing only remains over.--We must, before we pass on, consider  whether woman has really, as she tells us, given earnest for the  future weeding out of these her secondary sexual characters, by making  quite phenomenal advances within the lifetime of the present  generation; and, above all, whether there is any basis for woman's  confident assurance that, when for a few generations she shall have  enjoyed educational advantages, she will at any rate pull up level  with man.    The vision of the future may first engage our attention; for only this  roseate prospect makes of any man a feminist.    Now the basis that all this hope rests upon is the belief that it is a  law of heredity that acquired characteristics are handed down; and,  let it be observed, that whereas this theory found, not many decades  ago, under the influence of Darwin, thousands of adherents among  scientific men, it finds to-day only here and there an adherent.    But let that pass, for we have to consider here, not only whether  acquired characteristics are handed down, but further whether, \"if we  held that doctrine true,\" it would furnish scientific basis for the  belief that educational advantages carried on from generation to  generation would level up woman's intellect to man's; and whether, as  the suffragist also believes, the narrow education of past generations  of women can be held responsible for their present intellectual  shortcomings.    A moment's consideration will show--for we may here fix our eyes only  on the future--that woman could not hope to advance relatively to man  except upon the condition that the acquired characteristics of woman,  instead of being handed down equally to her male and female  descendants, were accumulated upon her daughters.    Now if that be a law of heredity, it is a law which is as yet unheard  of outside the sphere of the woman suffrage societies. Moreover, one  is accustomed to hear women, when they are not arguing on the  suffrage, allege that clever mothers make clever sons.    It must, as it will have come home to us, be clear to every thoughtful  mind that woman's belief that she will, through education and the  cumulation of its effects upon her through generations, become a more  glorious being, rests, not upon any rational basis, but only on the  physiological fact that what is congenial to woman impresses itself  upon her as true. All that sober science in the form of history and  physiology would seem to entitle us to hope from the future of woman  is that she will develop _pari passu [step by step]_ with man; and  that education will teach her not to retard him overmuch by her  lagging in the rear.    In view of this larger issue, the question as to whether woman has, in  any real sense of the word, been making progress in the course of the  present generation, loses much of interest.    If to move about more freely, to read more freely, to speak out her  mind more freely, and to have emancipated herself from traditionary  beliefs--and, I would add, traditionary ethics--is to have advanced,  woman has indubitably advanced.    But the educated native too has advanced in all these respects; and he  also tells us that he is pulling up level with the white man.    Let us at any rate, when the suffragist is congratulating herself on  her own progress, meditate also upon that dictum of Nietzsche,  \"Progress is writ large on all woman's banners and bannerets; but one  can actually see her going back.\"      III"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#8)"],[1,"since we--oh, you know. I married him for his money and I still  don't know why he married me. Yes, I do, but I've never liked to admit  it. He'd made a lot of money in the market and had built this house.  He needed a wife the way he needed an automobile, a portable bar, a  Capehart, a thoroughbred Great Dane and a membership in the Pond Club.  I was available, at a price, which he met--but that's all there is to  our story.\"    \"Poor Jimmie!\" I sympathized. \"We're both lost, I guess. No, I'm not  Winnie but I don't know who else I could possibly be. You see, less  than twenty-four hours ago I was a lieutenant-commander on a light  carrier in the North Pacific and--\"    Germaine slowly withdrew her hand from mine.    \"Oh!\" she exclaimed softly. \"Oh Winnie! Poor old idiot! I'll take care  of you and see that you get over this. Wait, I'll call the doctor right  away. The Hartford Sanctuary's a very nice place, and I can come over  every week to--\"    I shook my head. \"You'll do nothing of the kind, my dear,\" I ordered.  \"No doctor can help me on this one. Besides,\" I added, \"how do you know  that I wasn't batty before and have just come to my senses.\"    Her eyes were frightened. \"All right, dear,\" she agreed. \"I like you  better this way, anyhow.\"          CHAPTER 6      \"Thanks, Jimmie,\" I replied. \"I'm going to try to stay this way.\"    My wife sat down beside me and studied me closely. \"You _look_  different,\" she remarked. \"To me, at any rate. You're sort of coming to  a focus. If only--. You're so different and--strange.\"    Here was my chance to recover lost ground.    \"As near as I can make out,\" I said, \"I've had a kind of amnesia. I  know you, of course, and my name, and that this is my house and that  Ponto is my dog, even though he tried to bite me. I know the Pond Club  and the Harvard Club, but that's about all I seem able to remember.  I can't recall where I work or where I bank, or who my friends are  or what kind of car I drive or what I was doing before yesterday  afternoon.\"    She relaxed at the holy scientific word 'amnesia,' as though to name a  mystery explained it.    \"But you were saying something about being on an aircraft carrier in  the Pacific,\" she objected.    I laughed. \"That must have been part of a very vivid dream I was having  in a chair in the bar at the Pond, when Ranty Tolan woke me up. It was  one of those dreams which seemed so real that real life seemed like a  dream. It still does a bit. That's where my alleged mind got stalled  and I'm still floundering around. Help me, won't you?\"    \"You didn't seem to need much help remembering Virginia Rutherford,\"  she remarked, \"but I'll try to fill in some of the gaps for you. You  have your own firm--Tompkins, Wasson and Cone--at No. 1 Wall Street.  It's sort of combination brokerage office and investment counsel. You  once told me that your specialty was finding nice rich old ladies  and helping them re-invest their unearned millions. You bank at the  National City Farmers and your car is a black '41 Packard coupe.\"    \"That helps a lot,\" I thanked her. \"Now how about my friends? If I go  to town tomorrow, I ought to be on the look-out for them. Business  isn't so good right now that I can afford to let myself be run in as an  amnesiac while my partners look after the loot.\"    She frowned. \"I don't know much about your friends in town, since so  many of them are in the war,\" she admitted. \"There's Merry Vail, of  course, who roomed with you at Harvard, but he hasn't come out here  much since Adela divorced him after that business in Bermuda. Sometimes  you talk about the men you see at the Club but I've never been able  to keep track of the Phils and Bills and Neds and Joes and Dicks and  Harrys. You'll have to find your own way there. At the office, of  course, there's Graham Wasson and Phil Cone, your partners, but you  won't have much trouble once you're at your desk. Wasson is dark and  plump and Cone is fair and plump and they're both about five years  younger than you are.\"    \"The office doesn't worry me,\" I agreed. \"I can handle anything that  develops there.\"    \"You know, Winnie,\" Jimmie remarked, \"if I were you I wouldn't try to  go to town for a few days. The office will run itself and you need a  rest. I don't know much about amnesia but I've always heard that rest  and kind treatment--\"    \"Uh-uh!\" I dissented emphatically. \"Worst thing in the world for it.  I've always heard that the thing to do is to go back over the ground  until you come to the thing that gave you the original shock and then  it all comes back to you. If I stick around Bedford Hills I'll just get  panicky over not being sure whether I remember things or not. I'll go  to town in the morning and see if I can't find myself.\"    She laughed, as wives laugh. \"You may be a changed man,\" she announced,  \"but you're still stubborn as a mule. Tell me, to change the subject,  you say that you remember me. Tell me what I seem like to you, now  that you've changed, as you say, aside from age, sex, scars and  distinguishing marks, if any, and marital status.\"    I closed my eyes and thought of Dorothy as she had been that last night  in Hartford before she walked out and I decided to join the Navy as a  Reserve Officer.    \"You are piano music on a summer night--something Scarlatti or  Mozart--thin, cool, precise, gay. You are apple blossoms against a  Berkshire hillside. You are the smoke of fallen leaves climbing into  the cool October sky. You are surf on a sandy beach, with the gulls  wheeling and the white-caps racing past the lighthouse on the point.  You are bobsleds and hot coffee and dough-nuts by a roaring wood fire.  And you're a lost child, with two pennies in your fist, looking in the  window of a five-cent candy-shop.\"    Germaine relaxed. \"Except for that last bit, Winnie, you made me sound  like a year-round vacation resort or an ad for a new automobile. You've  mentioned almost everything about me except the one thing I obviously  am.\"    \"Which is?\"    \"A simple, rather stupid woman, I guess,\" Germaine sighed, \"who's had  everything in life except what she wants.\"    \"All women are simple,\" I pontificated, \"since what they want is  simple.\"    \"You moron!\" she blazed. \"Don't you see that no woman knows what she  wants until she is made to want it. You ... you never made me want  anything simple, except to crack you over the head with something.\"    After she had left, I sat for a long time. There seemed to be nothing  to do or say. Winnie's domestic life was still in too much of a snarl  for me to do the obvious thing and follow Germaine upstairs, and into  her bedroom, lock the door, and kiss her tear-stained face and tell her  that I was sorry I had hurt her.... Before it would be safe to accept  her gambits I must first explore my business connections. Hadn't my  wife said something about girls in the office?           *       *       *       *       *    My first stop in the morning, after I had been careful to take a late  commuting train in to the city in order to avoid business men who were  sure to know and greet Winnie Tompkins, was the Pond Club.    Tammy was behind the bar and as soon as I entered he turned and mixed  me a powerful pick-me-up. I drained it with the usual convulsive effort  and then pretended to relax.    \"Thanks, Tammy,\" I said. \"That's what I needed.\" \"Good morning, Mr.  Tompkins,\" he remarked. \"I'm glad to see you back. You were looking a  trifle seedy--if you don't mind my saying so, sir--when you were in  here Monday afternoon.\"    \"I took a day off in the country and got rested up,\" I told him. \"I  feel fine now. Anybody in the Club?\"    \"Not just now, sir. A couple of gentlemen were asking for you yesterday  afternoon--that would be Tuesday. That was Commander Tolan, sir, and  a friend of his, a Mr. Harcourt his name was, who hasn't been here  before. They asked me if you were at your home but I just laughed.  'Him gone home?' I said. 'Not while he has a girl and a flat on Park  Avenue.' Begging your pardon, Mr. Tompkins, I knew you didn't want to  be bothered wherever you were and so I said the first thing that came  to my head.\"    \"You're doing fine, Tammy,\" I assured him. \"I don't want to see anybody  for a couple of days. Now then, I'd like you to tell me what happened  here Monday afternoon. It's the first time in my life I've ever drawn a  complete blank.\"    \"Well, sir,\" the Club steward recited. \"You came in about two o'clock  and sat down in your usual chair--that one in the corner. You said  something about having had lunch at the Harvard Club, sir, and had a  couple of Scotch and sodas here.\"    \"Was I tight, Tammy?\"    \"Not to call tight. You didn't show it, and after a time you went to  sleep, like you was tired out. You was still sleeping when Mr. Morgan,  Mr. Davis and Commander Tolan came in. That would be a little after  three o'clock, sir. They made some talk about how you were sleeping  through the noise they made, that it would take a bomb to wake you.  Then, sir, I guess you had some kind of a dream. You began talking like  and thrashing with your arms and making noises. So Commander Tolan he  said, 'Jesus we can't drink with that going on' and went and shook you  by the shoulder until you woke up. You'd been dreaming all right, Mr.  Tompkins, because you talked wild when you woke up, about Alaska and  where were you. The others joked a bit about it after you left but I'd  take my oath, sir, that you weren't really what might be called tight,  Mr. Tompkins.\"    \"Thanks a million, Tammy,\" I said. \"That's a load off my mind. I drew  a blank and didn't know where I'd been or what I'd been doing. Can you  let me have some money? I'm a bit short of cash.\"    \"Of course, sir. How much will you need?\"    \"A couple of hundred will do,\" I told him, \"if you have that much.\"    \"That will be easy, sir. If you'll just sign a check, like the house  rules says, I'll get it from the safe.\"   "]]]
