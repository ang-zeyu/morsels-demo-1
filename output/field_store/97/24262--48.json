[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33799"],[0,"The Blood of the Arena (#8)"],[1," a burst of admiration answered it. \"Stand aside,  everybody!\" He had said, \"Stand aside, everybody!\" What a man!    He walked up to the beast absolutely alone, and instantly silence fell  again. He calmly readjusted the red flag on the stick, extended it, and  advanced thus a few steps until he almost touched the nose of the bull,  which stood stupefied and terrified by the audacity of the man.    The public dared not speak nor even breathe but admiration shone in  their eyes. What a youth! He walked in between the very horns! He  stamped the ground impatiently with one foot, inciting the beast to  attack, and that enormous mass of flesh, defended by sharp horns fell  bellowing upon him. The _muleta_ passed over his horns, which grazed the  tassels and fringes of the dress of the bull-fighter standing firm in  his place, with no other movement than a backward bending of his body. A  shout from the crowd answered this whirl of the _muleta_. Hurrah!    The infuriated beast returned; he re-attacked the man with the \"rag,\"  who repeated the pass, with the same roar from the public. The bull,  made more and more furious by the deception, attacked the athlete who  continued whirling the red flag within a short distance, fired by the  proximity of danger and the wondering exclamations of the crowd that  seemed to intoxicate him.    Gallardo felt the animal snort upon him; the moist vapor from its muzzle  wet his right hand and his face. Grown familiar by contact he looked  upon the brute as a good friend who was going to let himself be killed  to contribute to his glory.    The bull stood motionless for some seconds as if tired of this play,  gazing with hazy eyes at the man and at the red scarf, suspecting in his  obscure mind the existence of a trick which with attack after attack was  drawing him toward death.    Gallardo felt the presentiment of his happiest successes. Now! He rolled  the flag with a circular movement of his left hand around the staff and  he raised his right hand to the height of his eyes, standing with the  sword pointing towards the neck of the beast.    The crowd was stirred by a movement of protest and horror.    \"Don't strike yet,\" shouted thousands of voices. \"No, no!\"    It was too soon. The bull was not in good position; he would make a  lunge and catch him. But Gallardo moved regardless of all rules of the  art. What did either rules or life matter to that desperate man?    Suddenly he threw himself forward with his sword held before him, at the  same time that the wild beast fell upon him. It was a brutal, savage  encounter. For an instant man and beast formed a single mass and thus  moved together several paces, no one knowing which was the conqueror,  the man with an arm and part of his body lying between the two horns, or  the beast lowering his head and trying to seize with his defences the  puppet of gold and colors which seemed to be slipping away from him.    At last the group parted, the _muleta_ lay on the ground like a rag, and  the bull-fighter, his hands free, went staggering back from the impulse  of the shock until he recovered his equilibrium a few steps away. His  clothing was in disorder; his cravat floated outside his vest, gored and  torn by one of the horns.    The bull raced on impelled by the momentum of his start. Above his broad  neck the red hilt of the sword embedded to the cross scarcely protruded.  Suddenly the animal paused, shuddering with a painful movement of  obeisance, doubled his fore legs, inclined his head till his bellowing  muzzle touched the sand, and finished by lying down with shudders of  agony.    It seemed as if the very building would fall, as if the bricks dashed  against one another, as if the multitude was about to fly  panic-stricken, by the way it rose to its feet, pale, tremulous,  gesticulating and throwing its arms. Dead! What a stroke! Every one had  believed for a second that the _matador_ was caught on the horns. All  had felt sure they would see him fall upon the sand stained with blood  and, as they beheld him standing up still giddy from the shock but  smiling, surprise and amazement augmented the enthusiasm.    \"How fierce!\" they shouted from the tiers of seats, not finding a more  fitting word to express their astonishment--\" How rash!\"    Hats flew into the arena and a deafening roar of applause, like a shower  of hail, ran from row to row of seats as the _matador_ advanced around  the ring until he stood in front of the president's box.    The ovation burst out clamorously when Gallardo, extending his arms,  saluted the president. All shouted, demanding for the swordsman the  honors due to mastery. They must give him the ear. Never was this  distinction so merited; few sword-thrusts like that had ever been seen;  and the enthusiasm increased when a _mozo_ of the plaza handed him a  dark triangle, hairy and blood-stained--the point of one of the beast's  ears.    The third bull was now in the ring, but the ovation to Gallardo  continued as though the public had not yet recovered from its amazement;  as though all that might occur during the rest of the bull-fight would  be tame in comparison.    The other bull-fighters, pale with professional envy, strove valiantly  to attract the attention of the public. Applause was given, but it was  weak and faint after the former ovations. The public was exhausted by  the delirium of its enthusiasm and heeded absent-mindedly the events  that took place in the ring. Fiery discussions broke out and ran from  tier to tier. The adherents of other bull-fighters, serene and unmoved  by the transports that had overcome the people, took advantage of the  spontaneous movement, to turn the discussion upon Gallardo. Very  valiant, very daring, a suicide, they said, but that was not art. And  the vehement adherents of the idol, proud of his audacity and carried  away by their own feelings, became indignant like the believer who sees  the miracles of his favorite saint held in doubt.    The attention of the public was diverted by incidents that disturbed the  people on some of the tiers of seats. Suddenly those in one section  moved; the spectators rose to their feet, turning their backs to the  ring; arms and canes whirled above their heads. The rest of the crowd  ceased looking at the arena, directing their attention to the seat of  trouble and to the large numbers, painted on the inner wall, that marked  the different sections of the amphitheatre.    \"Fight in the third!\" they yelled joyfully. \"Now there's a row in the  fifth!\"    Following the contagious impulse of the crowd, all became excited and  rose to their feet to see over their neighbors' heads but were unable to  distinguish anything except the slow ascent of the police who, opening a  passage from step to step, reached the group where the dispute had  begun.    \"Sit down!\" exclaimed the more prudent, deprived of their view of the  ring where the bull-fighters continued the game.    Little by little the waves of the multitude calmed, the rows of heads  assumed their former regularity on the circular lines of the benches,  and the bull-fight went on. But the nerves of the audience were shaken  and their state of mind manifested itself in unjust animosity toward  certain fighters or by profound silence.    The public, exhausted by the recent intense emotion, found all the  events tame. They sought to allay their ennui by eating and drinking.  The venders in the plaza went about between _barreras_, throwing with  marvellous skill the articles bought. Oranges flew like red balls to the  highest row, going from the hand of the seller to those of the buyer in  a straight line, as if pulled by a thread. Bottles of carbonated drinks  were uncorked. The liquid gold of Andalusian wines shone in little  glasses.    A movement of curiosity circulated along the benches. Fuentes was about  to fix the _banderillas_ in his bull and every one expected some  extraordinary show of skill and grace. He advanced alone to the centre  of the plaza with the _banderillas_ in one hand, serene, tranquil,  walking slowly, as though he were to begin a game. The bull followed his  movements with curious eyes, amazed to see the man alone before him  after the former hurly-burly of fluttering and extended capes, of cruel  barbs thrust into his neck, of horses that came and stood within reach  of his horns, as if offering themselves to his attack.    The man hypnotized the beast. He drew near until he could touch his poll  with the point of the _banderillas_, then he ran slowly away, with short  steps, the bull after him, as though persuaded into obedience and drawn  against his will to the extreme opposite side of the plaza. The animal  seemed to be mastered by the bull-fighter; he obeyed him in all his  movements until the man, calling the game ended, extended his arms with  a _banderilla_ in each hand, raised his small, slender body upon his  toes, advanced toward the bull with majestic ease, and thrust the gayly  colored darts into its neck.    Three times he performed the same feat, applauded by the public. Those  who considered themselves connoisseurs retaliated now for the explosion  of enthusiasm provoked by Gallardo. This was a bull-fighter! This was  pure art.    Gallardo, standing near the barrier, wiped the sweat off his face with a  towel which Garabato handed him. Then he turned his back on the ring to  avoid seeing the prowess of his companion. Outside of the plaza he  esteemed his rivals with that feeling of fraternity established by  danger; but as soon as they stepped into the arena all were enemies and  their triumphs pained him as if they were offences. Now the enthusiasm  of the public seemed to him a robbery that diminished his own great  triumph.    When the fifth bull came out, it was for him, and he sprang into the  arena anxious to again startle the public by his daring.    When a _picador_ fell he threw his cape and enticed the bull to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33830"],[0,"Fur Farming (#8)"],[1,"r. It is advisable to  have a set of inside enclosures, and as it is necessary that the animals  are not annoyed by visitors. It is a good plan to have the space between  the inside and outside fences filled with trees and clumps of brush so  as to obstruct the view. The inner enclosures are small and designed for  single animals and pairs and should be about thirty or forty feet in  size. There should also be several larger enclosures for the males and  females, for, except during the breeding season it will do no harm to  allow the males to run together. Each separate enclosure should be  provided with a gate so that it will be an easy matter to remove the  foxes from one enclosure to another. The plan for the arrangement of the  yards as shown here is a good one and is taken from the Government  Bulletin.    [Illustration: Plan for Arrangement of Fox Yards.]    Each compartment should be provided with small kennels, for although the  fox will usually dig a den, the nature of the ground is not always  suitable and they take kindly to these artificial dens. They are usually  made four or five feet square and two or three feet high. If desired,  shelters may be made of boxes as shown in the cut. No bedding is  required, as the old foxes will do well without or will provide one  themselves.    [Illustration: Box Shelter for Female and Young.]    FEEDING.--Many fox raisers have failed to recognize the fact that the  fox is almost omnivorous and give a strictly meat diet according. While  this does not always have disastrous results, it is better to give them  a mixed food, including besides meat, table scraps, bread and milk, etc.  Overfeeding is a common trouble and should be avoided. Of course they  must have sufficient, but should not be allowed to become too fat, as  this spoils them for breeding purposes; also feeding should be at  regular intervals. The weight of a healthy fox is from six to nine  pounds, and when an animal weighs more than ten pounds it is almost  certain that it is too fat. When a number of animals are kept together  in one enclosure the boldest and strongest will usually get more than  its share of the food. Of course fresh drinking water must be provided  regularly.    One of the most successful breeders feeds a quarter of a pound of meat  and a quart of skim milk daily. A quarter of a pound of meat and a  handful of scraps is a fair daily allowance. Another fox farmer feeds  along with the meat a hoecake made of corn meal and sour milk.    Beef, mutton, fish, horseflesh, etc., are all good food for the fox. Old  worn-out animals may be secured in any rural district, but it is  absolutely necessary that the animals be healthy and the meat should be  kept on ice. One breeder claims that if everything were purchased, his  foxes would not cost him more than one cent each a day, but as he feeds  considerable table scraps the cost is even less.    BREEDING.--In the wild state the male fox mates with a single female but  in captivity one male will answer for two or even three females but it  is best to have all animals in pairs. It has been found best to place  the male with the female in December or January and leave them in  company until the last of March when the males should be removed. The  females should be kept in the small enclosures continuously and the  young foxes removed when weaned. They breed the first season, when less  than a year old, but as a rule the litters are small.    [Illustration: Corner of Fox Yard showing Stones to Prevent Escape by  Digging.]    As before stated it is absolutely necessary to prevent the animals from  becoming nervous from too frequent visits of strangers. This nervousness  has a bad effect on their breeding qualities. It is especially bad  after the young foxes are born, as the mother fearing for the safety of  her young, will move them about continuously until they are badly  injured or die of exposure. The keeper also should not disturb the young  but should keep away from them as much as possible. In raising silver  foxes, only the most perfect specimens should be kept for breeding  purposes. However, if there is a tendency to show some red among the fur  this may be bred out entirely by using care in selecting the breeding  stock.    [Illustration: Fox Yards, Showing Detail of Outer Fence.]    As there is considerable difference in the disposition of individuals  this should also be kept in mind and those animals showing the least  aversion to man should be selected, providing, of course, that they are  prolific and otherwise perfect.    A party in Ohio who has been raising foxes for some time writes as  follows:    Two years ago I added foxes to my game preserve and last spring my red  gave birth to five young foxes. My black male fox got to the young and  killed the three males. I now have three cross foxes, one black and four  red. I expect to have a big increase in the spring. Should I get a lot  of black pups next spring I will surely do well with my foxes.    I find that foxes are not strictly carnivorous (flesh eating) animals. I  feed them stale bread, milk and any kind of a dead fowl, rats, mice,  stale meats, muskrat, coon or any other carcass. I aim to give them all  they will eat, yet I often have thought that I feed them too much at one  time and not enough at other times.    I think foxes should be fed morning and evening only about what they  will eat. They should be given fresh water twice a day during the summer  months and the water should not be given them in a shallow vessel,  nothing lower than an ordinary bucket. They are sure to foul the water  if they can get over or in it.    Allow me to suggest to any one who contemplates raising foxes that one  of the essential things to do is to first build a kennel in such a way  that they will not gnaw or dig out. A safe fox pen can be built by  putting a stone wall or concrete two feet down, setting posts first,  then build wall around posts. Don't use any netting over two-inch mesh  and the poultry netting should be made of No. 17 wire. Fox will tear the  ordinary two-inch poultry netting as fast as you can put it on.    My kennel is 50 feet by 25 feet and 7 feet high, covered over the top  with ordinary poultry netting. One of the essential things to do after  kennel is built is to see that it is properly underdrained and to see  that plenty of dry leaves are put in kennel. Straw will do if leaves  cannot be gotten. A mound of earth would be an excellent thing in each  apartment of your kennels. Foxes are great to be constantly digging in  the ground. Keep plenty of boxes in your kennel with a nice smooth hole  in each box, as a rough hole destroys their fur.    [Illustration: Yards of a Successful Maine Fox Farm.]    A summary of the whole shows that the points most necessary of  consideration for success is in proper feeding, in giving particular  attention to the animals during the breeding season, in using special  care to prevent them from being frightened and in the keeper winning the  confidence of the captive animals. A careful study of their nature is  advised and it should always be kept in mind that foxes are wild animals  and therefore should have far more attention than is necessary with  domestic animals.          CHAPTER VI.    SKUNK RAISING.      There are but two species of skunk found in North America, namely, the  common striped skunk and the small spotted skunk of the Central  States,--commonly known as the \"civet cat.\" This latter name is wrong as  the real civet cat is an entirely different animal.    It is with the true skunk that this article has to deal, and of this  animal naturalists recognize several varieties, the only difference  being in size and markings.    They are found in all parts of the United States, with the exception of  the bunch-grass plains and the mountainous district of the West. They  occur again to the west of the mountain ranges and also are found in  most parts of Southern Canada. They are found in the prairie country and  in the hilly and mountainous districts of the East, and are at home in  the \"wilds\" as well as in the thickly settled districts, however, they  seem to thrive best in the farming sections and especially if the  country is of a hilly nature. Their dens are located along the gravelly  hillsides, quite often under the roots of trees and stumps but in the  prairie they den along the washouts and creek banks. In thickly settled  sections they frequently make their home under houses and outbuildings,  showing practically no fear of man and often appropriate the den of the  woodchuck.    They are nocturnal animals and as a rule do not wander far from the den  but in the fall they travel farther, looking for a good den in which to  spend the winter. Again, in early spring during the mating season, the  males travel considerably. While they are not a hibernating animal, they  stay in the dens during cold weather, also when the snow is loose and  deep, but are sure to be out on the first nice night.    The mating season of this animal is in February and early March and the  young are born mostly in May, although some will be born in April. There  are usually from four to ten young in a litter but occasionally there  will be a larger number.    The value of a skunk skin depends mainly on its size and markings, they  being graded by the buyers entirely by the amount of black fur,  providing, of course, that the skin is prime and well handled. There is  a considerable difference in respect to sizes and markings of the  average catches of the various sections. From some parts of the country  they will run quite large, in other parts small, and while in one  section they will run perhaps ninety per cent. long stripes, in other  parts of the country the black and short stripe grade predominates. Of  course the skunks of the South are not as well furred as those found  farther north.    Being slow moving animals, they can"]]]
