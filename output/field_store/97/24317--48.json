On the  following day the Boers made themselves unpleasantly obstreperous by  saluting the place with quick-firing guns, weapons whose shells burst  almost simultaneously with the report, thus depriving those aimed at of  the chance of running to cover.    The air of Mafeking is said to be equal to champagne, and perhaps to its  stimulating influence the garrison owed its sprightliness and activity.  The little township \"ran\" a journal of its own, and though not so  effervescent as _The Lyre_ of Ladysmith, it had its humorous side. The  _Mafeking Mail_, as it was called, was issued daily--shells permitting.  Quoting from the _Mail_ of the 1st of November, a facsimile of which was  reproduced by the _Daily Telegraph_, we read that--         \"We have borne the much-feared bombardment for a fortnight, and       still Mafeking stands. From what we have experienced we do not       consider ourselves too optimistic in anticipating a successful       ending to the contest. For the first time in the history of       Boer warfare have the Boers been defeated at every turn by a       force far inferior in point of numbers. Since the first attack       on Saturday, October 14th, they fly directly our guns are       heard. Safely out of range they fire into the town, but they do       not appear to be pining for another attempt at storming       Mafeking. In the 'general orders' issued last Sunday the       following occurs:--'The Colonel Commanding having made a       careful inspection of the defences of the town and the native       stadt, is now of opinion that no force that the Boers are       likely to bring against us could possibly effect an entrance at       any point.' Now, this is like the advertisements say a certain       cocoa is--grateful and comforting, and we feel that having got       so far through the ordeal, we have only to remain steadfast, as       the matter of a little time will see decided the first great       step towards the settlement of the future of South Africa.       There is no doubt that the attention of Great Britain, the       Colonies, in fact, the whole world, is now riveted upon this       little spot, which is now playing a prominent part in the most       important epoch in the history of this wonderful continent. We       know there is no need to urge the claims of our country and       kindred upon our gallant garrison. Being in such close touch       with each other that nothing but the exceptional circumstances       thrust upon us could have made possible, we are in a position       to judge and recognise the steady determination that British       blood and British pluck exhibit when such a crisis as the       present arises, and we know that the memory of Bronkhurst       Spruit, Majuba, and Potchefstrom will make that determination,       supported by the knowledge of our grand successes of the past       fortnight, more firm, more strong, and more united than has       been before, and this, with the grand soldier who is in command       here, will render certain the first stages towards the complete       crushing of the enemy.         \"There is no doubt that there was landed in South Africa by       Sunday last a body of 57,000 men, including probably twelve or       fourteen regiments of cavalry, twenty or twenty-two batteries       of artillery, and forty regiments of infantry, besides, most       likely, a body of mounted infantry. Of this force there will be       not less than 15,000 disembarked at Cape Town and despatched on       the road here. They may now be settling accounts with the Boers       outside Kimberley, in which case Vryburg might be reached by       Sunday, allowing for some delay at Fourteen Streams. When our       troops reach Vryburg the air of Mafeking will not suit Cronje       sprinters, so by _this day week_ we may begin to wish them a       pleasant journey back to the Transvaal. It will then be merely       an interchange of courtesy if we return the visit.         \"When the big gun with which the enemy hoped to pulverise us,       and which has sent more shells in the neighbourhood of the       hospital and women's laager than in any other parts of the       town, is taken by our troops, we think it only fair to Mafeking       that it should be brought here. It will make a good memorial       and be an object lesson to succeeding generations, who, reading       the history of our bombardment, and seeing the weapon employed       against our women and children, will be able to judge of the       nineteenth-century Boer's fitness to dominate such a territory       as the Transvaal. Let it be placed, say, in the space opposite       the entrance to the railway station, raised on end, with the       unexploded shells piled at its base, with a description of       Colonel Baden-Powell's clever defence of the place. We hope the       Colonel will bear the town in mind when the disposal of the gun       is under discussion.         \"Major Lord E. Cecil, C.S.O., last evening issued the following       under the heading of 'General Orders':\"--         [Here was recorded Colonel Baden-Powell's appreciation of the       action of Colonel Walford and his gallant men, which has been       previously quoted.]    The perusal of the opening paragraphs of the _Mafeking Mail_ serves to  enlighten us as to the degrees of hope deferred through which the plucky  inhabitants had to pass. The pathos of the expression, \"So by this day  week we may begin to wish them a pleasant journey back to the  Transvaal,\" can only be understood by comparing the date to which it  referred with that of the relief of the noble garrison--the 17th of May  1900!    On the 7th of November, the force under Major Godley and Captain Vernon  made a successful sortie, the excellent management of which was  recognised in an order issued by Colonel Baden-Powell:--    \"The surprise against the enemy to the westward of the town was smartly  and successfully executed at dawn this morning by a force under the  direction of Major Godley. Captain Vernon's squadron of the Protectorate  Regiment carried this operation out with conspicuous coolness and  steadiness. The gunners, under Major Panzera, fought and worked their  guns well under a very trying fire from the enemy. The Bechuanaland  Rifles are to be congratulated on the efficient services rendered by  them under Captain Cowan in this their first engagement in the field.  The enemy appeared to have suffered severely, while our casualties were  luckily very light. This is largely due to the fact that Major Godley  delivered his blow suddenly and quickly, and withdrew his force again in  good time and order. The Colonel Commanding has much pleasure in placing  on record a plucky piece of work by Gunners R. Cowan and F. H. Godson.  The Hotchkiss gun, of which they had charge, was overturned and its  trail-hook broken in course of action. In spite of a very heavy fire  from the enemy's one-pound Maxim and seven-pound Krupp, these men  attached the trail to the limber by ropes, and brought the gun safely  away.\"    At this time the town was surrounded by some 2000 Boers, and a heavy  shell-fire was daily exchanged. The damage done, however, was slight,  except in the case of the Convent, which seemed to be a favourite mark  for the Boer gunners. The trenches of the besiegers had been moved to  about 2000 yards of the town, and from here the enemy fired with rifles,  but with indifferent success. The Boers, in fact, were getting  disheartened. Colonel Baden-Powell was proving himself prepared to enter  into a competitive examination on the subject of \"slimness\" with them,  and they were somewhat disturbed at the intellectual strain demanded for  rivalry against so smart a pupil. All manner of efforts were made, and  there was even a Dutch council of war as to the propriety of making a  midnight attack upon the place. But the wily Colonel was ready for them.  He took care that lanterns should be placed in suitable positions to  illumine the paths of the would-be assailants, and when they turned on  these lanterns the attention of their guns and broke them, more were  immediately found to take their place. There was also the British  bayonet in reserve, and a hint which they did not care to prove as a  certainty--that dynamite was somewhere or other arranged in a ring round  the place, so that at a given sign the too pressing attentions of  intruders might be disposed of. These some one called \"the B. P.  Surprise Packets,\" which were arranged on the lucky-tub principle, ready  for those who might venture on an experimental dive. The exact locality  was not disclosed, in order that their whereabouts might prove a  never-ending source of wonder and interest to the besiegers.    [Illustration: OUTPOST AND ENTRENCHMENT, SOUTHERN FORT, MAFEKING]    As before said, continual sorties took place, and Colonel Baden-Powell  succeeded in capturing mules and horses from the enemy and generally  harassing him. Great expectations sustained the gallant little party  that Colonel Plumer's force would shortly make its way from the north  and join hands with Colonel Baden-Powell. Early in November the opposing  forces stood thus:--      Colonel Baden-Powell, with 500 Cavalry, 200 Cape Mounted        Police, and B.S.A. Company's Mounted Police, 60        Volunteers, six machine-guns, two 7-pounders, and 200        to 300 townsmen used to arms                            1500      1000 Transvaal Boers under Commandant Cronje, and 500        Boers at Maritzani                                      1500    But later, some of the Boers were drawn off for service in the south.    [Illustration: SERGEANT-MAJOR--IMPERIAL LIGHT HORSE.    Photo by Gregory & Co., London.]      KURUMAN AND ELSEWHERE    Of the diminutive town of Kuruman and its gallant struggle little can be  said.

I beg to remain, Gentlemen,    Yours most sincerely,    F. Liszt    Address the Symphonies to Mr. Ricordi, Florence. From the 15th of  June till the 1st of September I shall be in the neighborhood of  Lucca. Ricordi's address is the safest.        21. To the Beethoven Committee at Bonn    [Printed in L. Ramann's Biography of Liszt, vol. 1]    Gentlemen,    As the subscription for Beethoven's monument is only getting on  slowly, and as the carrying out of this undertaking seems to be  rather far distant, I venture to make a proposal to you, the  acceptance of which would make me very happy. [In Bonn,  Beethoven's birthplace, a committee had been formed to erect a  Beethoven monument. Yet, in spite of the assent which met the  proposal, the contributions flowed in so meagrely--Paris, for  example, contributed only 424 francs 90 centimes--that Liszt, on  reading this in a paper, immediately formed the noble resolution  mentioned in the above letter. \"Such a niggardly almsgiving, got  together with such trouble and sending round the hat, must not be  allowed to help towards building our Beethoven's monument!\" he  wrote to Berlioz. Thus the German nation has in great measure to  thank Franz Liszt for the monument erected to its greatest  composer at Bonn.]    I offer myself to make up, from my own means, the sum still  wanting for the erection of the monument, and ask no other  privilege than that of naming the artist who shall execute the  work. That artist is Bartolini of Florence, who is universally  considered the first sculptor in Italy.    I have spoken to him about the matter provisionally, and he  assures me that a monument in marble (which would cost about  fifty to sixty thousand francs) could be finished in two years,  and he is ready to begin the work at once. I have the honor to  be, etc.,    Franz Liszt    Pisa, October 3rd, 1839        22. To Count Leo Festetics in Pest    [Printed in F. von Schober's \"Letters about Liszt's Sojourn in  Hungary.\"]    Dear Count,    Shall you like to have me again at Pest this year? I know not. In  any case you are threatened with my presence from the 18th to the  22nd of next December. I shall come to you a little older, a  little more matured, and, permit me to say, more finished an  artist, than I was when you saw me last year, for since that time  I have worked enormously in Italy. I hope you have kept me in  remembrance, and that I may always count on your friendship,  which is dear to me.    What joy, what an immense happiness it will be to be once more in  my own country, to feel myself surrounded by such noble and  vigorous sympathies, which, thank God, I have done nothing to  forfeit in my distant and wandering life. What feelings, what  emotions will then fill my breast! All this, dear Count, I will  not attempt to express to you, for in truth I should not know  how. Let it suffice you to know that the love of my country, of  my chivalrous and grand country, has ever lived most deeply in my  heart; and that, if unhappily it does not seem likely that I can  ever show to my country what a love and devotion I feel for it,  the sentiments will remain none the less unchanged in my heart.    But I will not tire you any longer with myself and my sentiments.    I forgot to tell you that for nearly a week I have been confined  to my bed with a very severe fever, which might easily have  become more serious still. My second concert was obliged to be  put off on account of it. Today my doctor has given me permission  to play on Wednesday. I don't really know whether I shall be able  to do it, for my hand trembles fearfully. Excuse this horrible  writing, but I did want to send you a few words. It is a sort of  anticipation of Pest, which is sweet to me.    A revoir then very soon, dear Count; meanwhile believe me, as  ever, yours most sincerely,    F. Liszt    November 24th, 1839, in bed        23. To Clara Wieck    [The great pianist, afterwards Schumann's wife.]    Pest, December 25th, 1839    How grateful I am, Mademoiselle, for the kind remembrance you  keep of me! And how much I am already rejoicing at the thought of  seeing you and hearing you again soon in Leipzig! I was so vexed  not to be in Paris last winter when I knew you were going to  spend some time there. Perhaps I should have been able to be of  some little use to you there. You know that, at all times and in  every country, I shall always be at your service. I should become  too lengthy if I allowed myself to reply in detail to your kind  questions about my new compositions. I worked immensely hard in  Italy. Without exaggeration I think I have written four to five  hundred pages of pianoforte music. If you have patience to hear  half a quarter of them I shall be delighted to play them to you,  so so.    The \"Studies after Paganini,\" which are dedicated to you, will  only appear in two months' time; but I will bring you the proofs,  which have long been corrected, to Leipzig.    Once more many thanks, and many tender and respectful wishes for  everything that can contribute to your happiness. And above all a  bientot.    Yours in admiration and sympathy,    F. Liszt        24. To Robert Schumann in Leipzig    [Autograph in the Royal Library in Berlin.]    Dresden, March 27th, 1840    My dear Schumann,    It is all splendid. Only I should prefer to play the \"Hexameron\"  last, so as to finish with orchestra. Please, therefore, have the  \"Etudes\" and the \"Carnaval\" put after the Mendelssohn Concerto!  [Refers to Liszt's third concert in Leipzig, on March 30th, 1840,  for the benefit of the Orchestral Pension Fund.]    Best remembrances to Mendelssohn and Hiller; and believe me yours  ever,    F. Liszt    I shall certainly return Monday morning, for on Sunday I am  giving a concert for the poor here. But if it should de possible  for me to come on Sunday...but I doubt it. [Together with this  letter a friend, Carl K[ragen?], writes to Schumann: \"He [Liszt]  has played me the glorious Mendelssohn Concerto. It was divine!  Tomorrow Tieck is to read Faust for Liszt at my mother's house,  and Liszt is to play at our house with Lipinski!, Do come for it!  Ah, if you could only induce Mendelssohn and his wife to come  too!\"]        25. To Franz von Schober in Vienna    [The autographs of all the letters in this collection to Schober  are in the possession of Fran Babette Wolf at Dresden.-Addressed  to the poet and writer, an intimate and worthy friend of Franz  Schubert. He became Councillor of Legation to Weimar, and died at  Dresden in 1882.]    Metz, April 3rd, 1840    I did not get any news from you at Leipzig, dear Schober, as I  expected. I am afraid I was very indiscreet in asking you to be  so good as to undertake this work, which I should have valued so  much, coming from you. [In answer to the distorted reports in  various newspapers of Liszt's visit to Hungary (January, 1840),  Schober, who had been an eyewitness, thought it right to clear up  the misrepresentations, which he did in the form of \"Letters  about Liszt's Sojourn in Hungary\"; these he published, but much  later (Berlin, Schlesinger, 1843)] But I will not speak of it any  more. If by any chance you have already done it I should be  grateful to you to send it me--otherwise we will not speak of it  any more.    Do you know that I have been pursued by one constant regret  during my journey, the regret not to have induced you to  accompany me? Your society has always been beneficial and  strengthening to me: I do not know why, but I imagine that we  should live smoothly together. Your qualities, your faults (if  you have any), your character and temper, all please me and  attach me to you. You know that I flatter myself I can understand  and appreciate you...Should you see any great difficulty in  joining me somewhere next autumn-at Venice, for example--and in  making a European tour with me? Answer me frankly on this matter.  And once more, the question of money need not be considered. As  long as we are together (and I should like you to have at least  three free years before you) my purse will be yours, on the sole  condition that you consent to undertake the management of our  expenses,--and that you are thoroughly convinced beforehand of  the gratitude I shall feel towards you.    Excuse me, my dear good friend, for entering so plainly into  matters, but we have talked together too openly, it seems to me,  for it to be possible that your delicate feeling on certain  points should be wounded by this.    I have sent back Kiss, of Dresden. He is a good fellow, but a  little awkward, and wanting in a certain point of honor, without  which a man is not a man as I understand the word. So I am alone  now, and am not going to have any one tacked on to me. A former  pupil of mine, Monsieur Hermann, has undertaken to arrange my  concerts, which is a great relief to me. A propos of concerts, I  gave six (in nine days!) at Prague, three at Dresden, and the  same number at Leipzig (in twelve days)--so I am perfectly tired  out, and feel great need of rest. That was good, wasn't it?  Adieu, my dear good friend-let me hear from you soon (address 19,  Rue Pigalle, Paris), and depend entirely upon me--nunc et semper.    Yours ever sincerely,    F. Liszt    Will you be so good as to go to Diabelli's [Music publisher in  Vienna] when you pass by, and advise him again not to publish the  third part of the Hungarian Melodies (which I sent him by Hartel)  without first sending me a proof to Paris to correct. Adieu.    Best remembrances to Kriehuber [A well-known Vienna painter and  lithographer, from whom a number of Liszt portraits have come.]  and Lowy. Why does not the latter write to me?        26.
