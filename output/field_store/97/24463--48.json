[_Siegfried's mien and gestures show that he          has understood the bird's song. He sees Mime          approaching, and remains without moving, leaning          on his sword, observant and self-contained, in his          place on the knoll till the close of the following          scene._    MIME            [_Steals forward, and observes Siegfried from the          foreground._        He weighs in his mind      The booty's worth;      Can there by chance      Have come this way      A Wanderer wise      Who talked to the child,  And taught him crafty runes?      Doubly sly      Be then the dwarf;      My snares must be cunning,      Cleverly set,      That with cajoling      And wily falsehoods  The insolent boy I may fool.            [_He goes nearer to Siegfried and welcomes him with          flattering gestures._        Ha! Welcome, Siegfried!      Say, bold fighter,  Hast thou been taught how to fear?    SIEGFRIED    A teacher still is to find.    MIME        But the dragon grim      Has fallen before thee?  A fell and fierce monster was he.    SIEGFRIED    Though grim and spiteful the brute, I grieve over his death, While  there live still, unpunished, Blacker scoundrels than he was! The one  who bade me slay I hate far more than the slain.    MIME [_Very friendly._        Have patience! Thou wilt not      Look on me long.    [_Sweetly._        In endless sleep  Soon thine eyelids will be sealed.     Thy uses are over,            [_As if praising him._        Done is the deed;      The only task left  For me is to win the booty.  Methinks that task will not tax me;  Thou wert always easy to fool.    SIEGFRIED    To me thou art plotting harm, then?    MIME [_Astonished._        What makes thee think that?            [_Continuing tenderly._    Siegfried, listen, my own one!  I have always loathed  Thee and all that are like thee.      It was not from love      That I reared thee with care:  The gold hid in Fafner's cave  I worked for as my reward.            [_As if he were promising him something nice._        If thou wilt not yield      It up to me,            [_As if he were ready to lay down his life for him._        Siegfried, my son,      Thou plainly must see            [_As if in friendly jest._    I have no choice but to slay thee!    SIEGFRIED        That I am hated      Pleases me;  But must I lose my life for thy pleasure?    MIME [_Angrily._        I never said that;      Thou hast made a mistake.      See, thou art weary      From stress of strife,  Burning with fever and thirst;      Mime, the kind one,      To cool thy thirst  Brought a quickening draught.      While thy blade thou didst melt      I brewed thee the drink;      Touch it, and straight  Thy sword shall be mine,  And mine the hoard and Tarnhelm too.            [_Tittering._    SIEGFRIED        So thou of my sword      And all it has won me--  Ring and booty--wouldst rob me?    MIME [_Violently._    Why wilt mistake so my words!  Do I drivel or dote?      I use the utmost      Pains with my speech,      That what in my heart      I mean may be hidden;      And the stupid boy  Misunderstands what I say!      Open thy ears, boy,      And attend to me!  Hear, now, what Mime means.  Take this: the drink will refresh thee  As my drinks oft have done.      Many a time      When fretful and bad,      Though loth enough,  The draughts I brought thou hast swallowed.    SIEGFRIED        Of a cooling drink      I were glad;  Say, how has this one been brewed?    MIME            [_Jesting merrily, as if describing to him a          pleasant state of intoxication which the liquor is          to bring about._        Hei! Just drink it!      Trust to my skill.      In mist and darkness  Soon shall thy senses be sunk;      None to watch or ward them,  Stark-stretched shall thy limbs be.      Thou lying thus,      'Twere not hard  To take the booty and hide it;      But wert thou to awake,      Nevermore would      Mime be safe,  Even owning the ring.      So with the sword      He has made so sharp            [_With a gesture of extravagant joy._        First I will hack      The child's head off!  Then I shall have both rest and the ring!            [_Tittering._    SIEGFRIED    Thou wouldst, then, slay me when sleeping?    MIME [_Furiously._    Do what, child? Did I say that?            [_He takes pains to assume the utmost tenderness.          Carefully and distinctly._        I only mean      To chop off thy head!            [_With the appearance of heartfelt solicitude for          Siegfried's health._        For even if I      Had loathed thee less,      And had not thy scoffs      And my drudgery shameful  So loudly urged to vengeance,            [_Gently._        I should never dare to pause      Till from my path I thrust thee:            [_Jestingly again._    How else could I come by the booty,  Which Alberich covets as well?            [_He pours the liquid into the drinking-horn, and          offers it to Siegfried with pressing gestures._        Now, my W채lsung,      Wolf-begot,  Drink the draught and be choked,  And never drink again!            [_Tittering._    SIEGFRIED [_Threatens him with his sword._        Taste thou my sword,      Loathsome babbler!

Alberich's voice in mocking          laughter from the cleft._    SIEGFRIED            [_Looking at Mime on the ground, quietly hangs his          sword again on his belt._        Envy's wage      Pays Nothung;  'Twas for this that I forged him.            [_He picks up Mime's body, carries it to the knoll,          and throws it into the cave._        In the cavern, there,      Lie on the hoard;      With steadfast guile      The gold thou hast gained:  Now let it belong to its master!  And a watchman good  I give thee, that thieves  Never may enter and steal.            [_With a great effort he pushes the body of the          dragon in front of the entrance to the cave, which          it completely stops up._        There lie thou too,      Dragon grim;      Along with thy foe      Greedy of gain  Thou shalt guard the glittering gold:  So both at last shall rest in peace.            [_He looks down thoughtfully into the cave for a          time, and then turns slowly to the front of the          stage as if tired. He passes his hand over his          brow._        Hot I feel      From the heavy toil;      Fast and furious      Flows my blood,  My hand burns on my head.  High stands the sun in heaven;      From azure heights      Falls his gaze  Through a cloudless sky on my crown.  Pleasant shadows will cool me under the linden.            [_He stretches himself out under the lime-tree, and          again looks up through the boughs._    If only, pretty warbler,      So long and so      Rudely disturbed,  I could once more hear thee singing!      On a branch I see thee      Merrily swaying;      Chirping and chattering,      Brothers and sisters  Are happily hovering round.    But I--I am alone,  Without brother or sister;      My mother died,      My father fell,  Unseen by their son!      The one soul I knew      Was a loathsome old dwarf;            [_Warmly._        Love he festered not      By kindness;      Many a cunning      Snare did he set me;  At last I was forced to slay him.            [_He looks sorrowfully up at the branches._        Bird sweet and friendly,      I ask thee a boon:      Wilt thou find for me      A comrade true?--  Wilt thou choose for me the right one?      So oft I have called,      And yet no one has come!      Thou, my friend,      Wilt manage it better,  So wise thy counsel has been.            [_Softly._    Now sing! I hearken to thy song.    THE WOOD-BIRD'S VOICE        Hei! Siegfried has slain      The deceitful dwarf!      I know for him now      A glorious bride.  She sleeps where rugged rocks soar;  Ringed is her chamber by fire.      Who battles the flames,      Wakens the bride,  Br체nnhilde wins as reward.    SIEGFRIED            [_Starts up impetuously from his seat._        O lovely song,      Flower-sweet breath!      Thy yearning music      Burns in my breast!      Like leaping flame      It kindles my heart.      What races so swift      Through soul and senses?  Sweetest of friends, O say!            [_He listens._    THE WOOD-BIRD'S VOICE        Grieving yet glad,      Love I am singing;      Blissful, from woe      Weaving my song:  They only who yearn understand.    SIEGFRIED        Forth, forth then,      Swift and rejoicing!  Forth from the wood to the fell!      Just one thing more      I would learn, sweet singer:  Say, shall I break through the fire?  Can I awaken the bride?            [_He listens again._    THE WOOD-BIRD'S VOICE        No coward wins      Br체nnhild' for bride,      Or wakes the maid:  Only a heart without fear.    SIEGFRIED [_Shouting with joy._        The foolish boy      Who has never learned fear,  Dear bird, that dullard am I!      To-day I took endless      Trouble in vain,  To find out what fear was from Fafner.      With longing I burn      Now from Br체nnhild' to learn it.  What path soonest leads to the fell?            [_The bird flutters up, circles over Siegfried, and          flies hesitatingly before him._    SIEGFRIED    The bird to my goal will guide me.      Fly where thou wilt,      I follow thy flight!            [_He runs after the bird, who for a time flies          uncertainly hither and thither to tease him; at          last he follows him, when, taking a definite          direction towards the back, the bird flies away._    [Illustration]      [Illustration]          THE THIRD ACT          _A wild spot at the foot of a rocky mountain which      rises precipitously at the back on the left.

It has  additional qualities, it is true; but, since no two entities ever have  the same abilities, no two Lenses will ever be of identical qualities.  Strictly speaking, a Lens has no real power of its own; it merely  concentrates, intensifies, and renders available whatever powers are  already possessed by its wearer. You must develop your own powers and  your own abilities; we of Arisia, in furnishing the Lens, will have  done everything that we should do.\"    \"Of course, sir; and much more than we have any right to expect. You  have given me a Lens for Roderick Kinnison; how about the others? Who  is to select them?\"    \"You are, for a time.\" Silencing the man's protests, Mentor went on:  \"You will find that your judgment will be good. You will send to us  only one entity who will not be given a Lens, and it is necessary  that that one entity should be sent here. You will begin a system of  selection and training which will become more and more rigorous as  time goes on. This will be necessary; not for the selection itself,  which the Lensmen themselves could do among babies in their cradles,  but because of the benefits thus conferred upon the many who will not  graduate, as well as upon the few who will. In the meantime you will  select the candidates; and you will be shocked and dismayed when you  discover how few you will be able to send.    \"You will go down in history as First Lensman Samms; the Crusader,  the man whose wide vision and tremendous grasp made it possible for  the Galactic Patrol to become what it is to be. You will have highly  capable help, of course. The Kinnisons, with their irresistible driving  force, their indomitable will to do, their transcendent urge; Costigan,  back of whose stout Irish heart lie Erin's best of brains and brawn;  your cousins George and Ray Olmstead; your daughter Virgilia....\"    \"Virgilia! Where does _she_ fit into this picture? What do you know  about her--and how?\"    \"A mind would be incompetent indeed who could not visualize, from even  the most fleeting contact with you, a fact which has been in existence  for some twenty three of your years. Her doctorate in psychology;  her intensive studies under Martian and Venerian masters--even under  one reformed Adept of North Polar Jupiter--of the involuntary,  uncontrollable, almost unknown and hence highly revealing muscles  of the face, the hands, and other parts of the human body. You will  remember that poker game for a long time.\"    \"I certainly will.\" Samms grinned, a bit shamefacedly. \"She gave us  clear warning of what she was going to do, and then cleaned us out to  the last millo.\"    \"Naturally. She has, all unconsciously, been training herself for  the work she is destined to do. But to resume; you will feel yourself  incompetent, unworthy--that, too, is a part of a Lensman's Load. When  you first scan the mind of Roderick Kinnison you will feel that he, not  you, should be the prime mover in the Galactic Patrol. But know now  that no mind, not even the most capable in the universe, can either  visualize truly or truly evaluate itself. Commissioner Kinnison, upon  scanning your mind as he will scan it, will know the truth and will be  well content. But time presses; in one minute you leave.\"    \"Thanks a lot ... thanks.\" Samms got to his feet and paused,  hesitantly. \"I suppose that it will be all right ... that is, I can  call on you again, if...?\"    \"No,\" the Arisian declared, coldly. \"My visualization does not indicate  that it will ever again be either necessary or desirable for you to  visit or to communicate with me or with any other Arisian.\"    Communication ceased as though a solid curtain had been drawn between  the two. Samms strode out and stepped into the waiting vehicle, which  whisked him back to his lifeboat. He blasted off; arriving in the  control room of the _Chicago_ precisely at the end of the sixth hour  after leaving it.    \"Well, Rod, I'm back ...\" he began, and stopped; utterly unable to  speak. For at the mention of the name Samms' Lens had put him fully  en rapport with his friend's whole mind; and what he perceived struck  him--literally and precisely--dumb.    He had always liked and admired Rod Kinnison. He had always known  that he was tremendously able and capable. He had known that he was  big; clean; a square shooter; the world's best. Hard; a driver who  had little more mercy on his underlings in selected undertakings than  he had on himself. But now, as he saw spread out for his inspection  Kinnison's ego in its entirety; as he compared in fleeting glances that  terrific mind with those of the other officers--good men, too, all of  them--assembled in the room; he knew that he had never even begun to  realize what a giant Roderick Kinnison really was.    \"What's the matter, Virge?\" Kinnison exclaimed, and hurried up, both  hands outstretched. \"You look like you're seeing ghosts! What did they  do to you?\"    \"Nothing--much. But 'ghosts' doesn't half describe what I'm seeing  right now. Come into my office, will you, Rod?\"    Ignoring the curious stares of the junior officers, the Commissioner  and the Councillor went into the latter's quarters, and in those  quarters the two Lensmen remained in close consultation during  practically all of the return trip to Earth. In fact, they were still  conferring deeply, via Lens, when the _Chicago_ landed and they took a  ground-car into The Hill.    \"But who are you going to send first, Virge?\" Kinnison demanded. \"You  must have decided on at least some of them, by this time.\"    \"I know of only five, or possibly six, who are ready,\" Samms replied,  glumly. \"I would have sworn that I knew of a hundred, but they don't  measure up. Jack, Mason Northrop, and Conway Costigan, for the first  load. Lyman Cleveland, Fred Rodebush, and perhaps Bergenholm--I haven't  been able to figure him out, but I'll know when I get him under my  Lens--next. That's all.\"    \"Not quite. How about your identical-twin cousins, Ray and George  Olmstead, who have been doing such a terrific job of counter-spying?\"    \"Perhaps ... Quite possibly.\"    \"And if I'm good enough, Clayton and Schweikert certainly are, to name  only two of the commodores. And Knobos and DalNalten. And above all,  how about Jill?\"    \"Jill? Why, I don't ... she measures up, of course, but ... but at  that, there was nothing said against it, either ... I wonder....\"    \"Why not have the boys in--Jill, too--and thrash it out?\"    The young people were called in; the story was told; the problem  stated. The boys' reaction was instantaneous and unanimous. Jack  Kinnison took the lead.    \"Of course Jill's going, if anybody does!\" he burst out vehemently.  \"Count _her_ out, with all the stuff she's got? _Hardly_!\"    \"Why, Jack! This, from _you_?\" Jill seemed highly surprised. \"I have it  on excellent authority that I'm a stinker; a half-witted one, at that.  A jelly-brain, with come-hither eyes.\"    \"You are, and a lot of other things besides.\" Jack Kinnison did not  back up a millimeter, even before their fathers. \"But even at your  sapadilliest your half wits are better than most other people's whole  ones; and I never said or thought that your brain couldn't function,  whenever it wanted to, back of those sad eyes. Whatever it takes to be  a Lensman, sir,\" he turned to Samms, \"she's got just as much of as the  rest of us. Maybe more.\"    \"I take it, then, that there is no objection to her going?\" Samms asked.    There was no objection.    \"What ship shall we take, and when?\"    \"The _Chicago_. Now.\" Kinnison directed. \"She's hot and ready. We  didn't strike any trouble going or coming, so she didn't need much  servicing. Flit!\"    They flitted, and the great battleship made the second cruise as  uneventfully as she had made the first. The _Chicago's_ officers and  crew knew that the young people left the vessel separately; that they  returned separately, each in his or her lifeboat. They met, however,  not in the control room, but in Jack Kinnison's private quarters; the  three young Lensmen and the girl. The three were embarrassed; ill at  ease. The Lenses were--definitely--not working. No one of them would  put his Lens on Jill, since she did not have one.... The girl broke the  short silence.    \"Wasn't she the most perfectly _beautiful_ thing you ever saw?\" she  breathed. \"In spite of being over seven feet tall? She looked to be  about twenty--except her eyes--but she must have been a hundred, to  know so much--but what are you boys staring so about?\"    \"_She!_\" Three voices blurted as one.    \"Yes. She. Why? I know we weren't together, but I got the impression,  some way or other, that there was only the one. What did _you_ see?\"    All three men started to talk at once, a clamor of noise; then all  stopped at once.    \"You first, Spud. Whom did you talk to, and what did he, she, or it  say?\" Although Conway Costigan was a few years older than the other  three, they all called him by nickname as a matter of course.    \"National Police Headquarters--Chief of the Detective Bureau,\"  Costigan reported, crisply. \"Between forty three and forty five; six  feet and half an inch; one seventy five. Hard, fine, keen, a Big Time  Operator if there ever was one. Looked a lot like your father, Jill;  the same dark auburn hair, just beginning to gray, and the same deep  orange-yellow markings in his eyes. He gave me the works; then took  this Lens out of his safe, snapped it onto my wrist, and gave me two  orders--get out and stay out.\"    Jack and Mase stared at Costigan, at Jill, and at each other. Then they  whistled in unison.    \"I see this is not going to be a unanimous report, except possibly in  one minor detail,\" Jill remarked. \"Mase, you're next.\"    \"I landed on the campus of the University of Arisia,\" Northrop stated,  flatly. \"Immense place--hundreds of thousands of students. They look  me to the Physics Department--to the private laboratory of the"]]]
