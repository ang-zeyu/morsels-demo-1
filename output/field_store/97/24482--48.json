Rich  Bessie's heart may suffer as much grief as poor Mayrie's; she can be  just as lonely and discontented, and just as gay and happy.  I think,  friend Claus, it is your duty to make all little ones glad, whether  they chance to live in palaces or in cottages.\"    \"Your words are wise, fair Queen,\" replied Claus, \"and my heart tells  me they are as just as they are wise.  Hereafter all children may claim  my services.\"    Then he bowed before the gracious Fairy and, kissing Necile's red lips,  went back into his Valley.    At the brook he stopped to drink, and afterward he sat on the bank and  took a piece of moist clay in his hands while he thought what sort of  toy he should make for Bessie Blithesome.  He did not notice that his  fingers were working the clay into shape until, glancing downward, he  found he had unconsciously formed a head that bore a slight resemblance  to the Nymph Necile!    At once he became interested.  Gathering more of the clay from the bank  he carried it to his house.  Then, with the aid of his knife and a bit  of wood he succeeded in working the clay into the image of a toy nymph.  With skillful strokes he formed long, waving hair on the head and  covered the body with a gown of oakleaves, while the two feet sticking  out at the bottom of the gown were clad in sandals.    But the clay was soft, and Claus found he must handle it gently to  avoid ruining his pretty work.    \"Perhaps the rays of the sun will draw out the moisture and cause the  clay to become hard,\" he thought.  So he laid the image on a flat board  and placed it in the glare of the sun.    This done, he went to his bench and began painting the toy deer, and  soon he became so interested in the work that he forgot all about the  clay nymph.  But next morning, happening to notice it as it lay on the  board, he found the sun had baked it to the hardness of stone, and it  was strong enough to be safely handled.    Claus now painted the nymph with great care in the likeness of Necile,  giving it deep-blue eyes, white teeth, rosy lips and ruddy-brown hair.  The gown he colored oak-leaf green, and when the paint was dry Claus  himself was charmed with the new toy.  Of course it was not nearly so  lovely as the real Necile; but, considering the material of which it  was made, Claus thought it was very beautiful.    When Bessie, riding upon her white palfrey, came to his dwelling next  day, Claus presented her with the new toy.  The little girl's eyes were  brighter than ever as she examined the pretty image, and she loved it  at once, and held it close to her breast, as a mother does to her child.    \"What is it called, Claus?\" she asked.    Now Claus knew that Nymphs do not like to be spoken of by mortals, so  he could not tell Bessie it was an image of Necile he had given her.  But as it was a new toy he searched his mind for a new name to call it  by, and the first word he thought of he decided would do very well.    \"It is called a dolly, my dear,\" he said to Bessie.    \"I shall call the dolly my baby,\" returned Bessie, kissing it fondly;  \"and I shall tend it and care for it just as Nurse cares for me.  Thank  you very much, Claus; your gift has made me happier than I have ever  been before!\"    Then she rode away, hugging the toy in her arms, and Claus, seeing her  delight, thought he would make another dolly, better and more natural  than the first.    He brought more clay from the brook, and remembering that Bessie had  called the dolly her baby he resolved to form this one into a baby's  image.  That was no difficult task to the clever workman, and soon the  baby dolly was lying on the board and placed in the sun to dry.  Then,  with the clay that was left, he began to make an image of Bessie  Blithesome herself.    This was not so easy, for he found he could not make the silken robe of  the lord's daughter out of the common clay.  So he called the Fairies  to his aid, and asked them to bring him colored silks with which to  make a real dress for the clay image.  The Fairies set off at once on  their errand, and before nightfall they returned with a generous supply  of silks and laces and golden threads.    Claus now became impatient to complete his new dolly, and instead of  waiting for the next day's sun he placed the clay image upon his hearth  and covered it over with glowing coals.  By morning, when he drew the  dolly from the ashes, it had baked as hard as if it had lain a full day  in the hot sun.    Now our Claus became a dressmaker as well as a toymaker.  He cut the  lavender silk, and neaty sewed it into a beautiful gown that just  fitted the new dolly.  And he put a lace collar around its neck and  pink silk shoes on its feet.  The natural color of baked clay is a  light gray, but Claus painted the face to resemble the color of flesh,  and he gave the dolly Bessie's brown eyes and golden hair and rosy  cheeks.    It was really a beautiful thing to look upon, and sure to bring joy to  some childish heart.  While Claus was admiring it he heard a knock at  his door, and little Mayrie entered.  Her face was sad and her eyes red  with continued weeping.    \"Why, what has grieved you, my dear?\" asked Claus, taking the child in  his arms.    \"I've--I've--bwoke my tat!\" sobbed Mayrie.    \"How?\" he inquired, his eyes twinkling.    \"I--I dwopped him, an' bwoke off him's tail; an'--an'--then I dwopped  him an' bwoke off him's ear!  An'--an' now him's all spoilt!\"    Claus laughed.    \"Never mind, Mayrie dear,\" he said.  \"How would you like this new  dolly, instead of a cat?\"    Mayrie looked at the silk-robed dolly and her eyes grew big with  astonishment.    \"Oh, Tlaus!\" she cried, clapping her small hands together with rapture;  \"tan I have 'at boo'ful lady?\"    \"Do you like it?\" he asked.    \"I love it!\" said she.  \"It's better 'an tats!\"    \"Then take it, dear, and be careful not to break it.\"    Mayrie took the dolly with a joy that was almost reverent, and her face  dimpled with smiles as she started along the path toward home.        6.  The Wickedness of the Awgwas    I must now tell you something about the Awgwas, that terrible race of  creatures which caused our good Claus so much trouble and nearly  succeeded in robbing the children of the world of their earliest and  best friend.    I do not like to mention the Awgwas, but they are a part of this  history, and can not be ignored.  They were neither mortals nor  immortals, but stood midway between those classes of beings.  The  Awgwas were invisible to ordinary people, but not to immortals.  They  could pass swiftly through the air from one part of the world to  another, and had the power of influencing the minds of human beings to  do their wicked will.    They were of gigantic stature and had coarse, scowling countenances  which showed plainly their hatred of all mankind.  They possessed no  consciences whatever and delighted only in evil deeds.    Their homes were in rocky, mountainous places, from whence they sallied  forth to accomplish their wicked purposes.    The one of their number that could think of the most horrible deed for  them to do was always elected the King Awgwa, and all the race obeyed  his orders.  Sometimes these creatures lived to become a hundred years  old, but usually they fought so fiercely among themselves that many  were destroyed in combat, and when they died that was the end of them.  Mortals were powerless to harm them and the immortals shuddered when  the Awgwas were mentioned, and always avoided them.  So they flourished  for many years unopposed and accomplished much evil.    I am glad to assure you that these vile creatures have long since  perished and passed from earth; but in the days when Claus was making  his first toys they were a numerous and powerful tribe.    One of the principal sports of the Awgwas was to inspire angry passions  in the hearts of little children, so that they quarreled and fought  with one another.  They would tempt boys to eat of unripe fruit, and  then delight in the pain they suffered; they urged little girls to  disobey their parents, and then would laugh when the children were  punished.  I do not know what causes a child to be naughty in these  days, but when the Awgwas were on earth naughty children were usually  under their influence.    Now, when Claus began to make children happy he kept them out of the  power of the Awgwas; for children possessing such lovely playthings as  he gave them had no wish to obey the evil thoughts the Awgwas tried to  thrust into their minds.    Therefore, one year when the wicked tribe was to elect a new King, they  chose an Awgwa who proposed to destroy Claus and take him away from the  children.    \"There are, as you know, fewer naughty children in the world since  Claus came to the Laughing Valley and began to make his toys,\" said the  new King, as he squatted upon a rock and looked around at the scowling  faces of his people.  \"Why, Bessie Blithesome has not stamped her foot  once this month, nor has Mayrie's brother slapped his sister's face or  thrown the puppy into the rain-barrel.  Little Weekum took his bath  last night without screaming or struggling, because his mother had  promised he should take his toy cat to bed with him!  Such a condition  of affairs is awful for any Awgwa to think of, and the only way we can  direct the naughty actions of children is to take this person Claus  away from them.\"    \"Good! good!\" cried the big Awgwas, in a chorus, and they clapped their  hands to applaud the speech of the King.    \"But what shall we do with him?\" asked one of the creatures.    \"I have a plan,\" replied the wicked King; and what his plan was you  will soon discover.    That night Claus went to bed feeling very happy, for he had completed  no less than four pretty toys during the day, and they were sure, he  thought, to make four little children happy.  But while he slept the  band of invisible Awgwas surrounded his bed, bound"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5201"],[0,"Don Juan Tenorio (#8)"],[1,"anterior baja al     incognito during the previous  centro de la escena, encarándose con    scene, goes to centre stage,  don Juan.)                              facing Don Juan.)
