When you have got plenty of that, you can raise disputes and  strive to get another's goods. But you shall have no second chance to  deal so again: nay, let us settle our dispute here with true judgement  divided our inheritance, but you seized the greater share and carried it  off, greatly swelling the glory of our bribe-swallowing lords who love  to judge such a cause as this. Fools! They know not how much more the  half is than the whole, nor what great advantage there is in mallow and  asphodel [1301].    (ll. 42-53) For the gods keep hidden from men the means of life. Else  you would easily do work enough in a day to supply you for a full year  even without working; soon would you put away your rudder over the  smoke, and the fields worked by ox and sturdy mule would run to waste.  But Zeus in the anger of his heart hid it, because Prometheus the crafty  deceived him; therefore he planned sorrow and mischief against men. He  hid fire; but that the noble son of Iapetus stole again for men from  Zeus the counsellor in a hollow fennel-stalk, so that Zeus who delights  in thunder did not see it. But afterwards Zeus who gathers the clouds  said to him in anger:    (ll. 54-59) 'Son of Iapetus, surpassing all in cunning, you are glad  that you have outwitted me and stolen fire--a great plague to you  yourself and to men that shall be. But I will give men as the price for  fire an evil thing in which they may all be glad of heart while they  embrace their own destruction.'    (ll. 60-68) So said the father of men and gods, and laughed aloud. And  he bade famous Hephaestus make haste and mix earth with water and to put  in it the voice and strength of human kind, and fashion a sweet, lovely  maiden-shape, like to the immortal goddesses in face; and Athene to  teach her needlework and the weaving of the varied web; and golden  Aphrodite to shed grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that  weary the limbs. And he charged Hermes the guide, the Slayer of Argus,  to put in her a shameless mind and a deceitful nature.    (ll. 69-82) So he ordered. And they obeyed the lord Zeus the son of  Cronos. Forthwith the famous Lame God moulded clay in the likeness of a  modest maid, as the son of Cronos purposed. And the goddess bright-eyed  Athene girded and clothed her, and the divine Graces and queenly  Persuasion put necklaces of gold upon her, and the rich-haired Hours  crowned her head with spring flowers. And Pallas Athene bedecked her  form with all manners of finery. Also the Guide, the Slayer of Argus,  contrived within her lies and crafty words and a deceitful nature at the  will of loud thundering Zeus, and the Herald of the gods put speech in  her. And he called this woman Pandora [1302], because all they who dwelt  on Olympus gave each a gift, a plague to men who eat bread.    (ll. 83-89) But when he had finished the sheer, hopeless snare, the  Father sent glorious Argos-Slayer, the swift messenger of the gods, to  take it to Epimetheus as a gift. And Epimetheus did not think on what  Prometheus had said to him, bidding him never take a gift of Olympian  Zeus, but to send it back for fear it might prove to be something  harmful to men. But he took the gift, and afterwards, when the evil  thing was already his, he understood.    (ll. 90-105) For ere this the tribes of men lived on earth remote and  free from ills and hard toil and heavy sickness which bring the Fates  upon men; for in misery men grow old quickly. But the woman took off the  great lid of the jar [1303] with her hands and scattered all these and  her thought caused sorrow and mischief to men. Only Hope remained there  in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did  not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her,  by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus who gathers the clouds. But the rest,  countless plagues, wander amongst men; for earth is full of evils and  the sea is full. Of themselves diseases come upon men continually by day  and by night, bringing mischief to mortals silently; for wise Zeus took  away speech from them. So is there no way to escape the will of Zeus.    (ll. 106-108) Or if you will, I will sum you up another tale well and  skilfully--and do you lay it up in your heart,--how the gods and mortal  men sprang from one source.    (ll. 109-120) First of all the deathless gods who dwell on Olympus made  a golden race of mortal men who lived in the time of Cronos when he was  reigning in heaven. And they lived like gods without sorrow of heart,  remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them;  but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting  beyond the reach of all evils. When they died, it was as though they  were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful  earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt  in ease and peace upon their lands with many good things, rich in flocks  and loved by the blessed gods.    (ll. 121-139) But after earth had covered this generation--they are  called pure spirits dwelling on the earth, and are kindly, delivering  from harm, and guardians of mortal men; for they roam everywhere over  the earth, clothed in mist and keep watch on judgements and cruel deeds,  givers of wealth; for this royal right also they received;--then they  who dwell on Olympus made a second generation which was of silver and  less noble by far. It was like the golden race neither in body nor in  spirit. A child was brought up at his good mother's side an hundred  years, an utter simpleton, playing childishly in his own home. But when  they were full grown and were come to the full measure of their prime,  they lived only a little time in sorrow because of their foolishness,  for they could not keep from sinning and from wronging one another, nor  would they serve the immortals, nor sacrifice on the holy altars of the  blessed ones as it is right for men to do wherever they dwell. Then Zeus  the son of Cronos was angry and put them away, because they would not  give honour to the blessed gods who live on Olympus.    (ll. 140-155) But when earth had covered this generation also--they are  called blessed spirits of the underworld by men, and, though they are of  second order, yet honour attends them also--Zeus the Father made a third  generation of mortal men, a brazen race, sprung from ash-trees [1304];  and it was in no way equal to the silver age, but was terrible and  strong. They loved the lamentable works of Ares and deeds of violence;  they ate no bread, but were hard of heart like adamant, fearful men.  Great was their strength and unconquerable the arms which grew from  their shoulders on their strong limbs. Their armour was of bronze, and  their houses of bronze, and of bronze were their implements: there was  no black iron. These were destroyed by their own hands and passed to the  dank house of chill Hades, and left no name: terrible though they were,  black Death seized them, and they left the bright light of the sun.    (ll. 156-169b) But when earth had covered this generation also, Zeus  the son of Cronos made yet another, the fourth, upon the fruitful earth,  which was nobler and more righteous, a god-like race of hero-men who  are called demi-gods, the race before our own, throughout the boundless  earth. Grim war and dread battle destroyed a part of them, some in the  land of Cadmus at seven-gated Thebe when they fought for the flocks of  Oedipus, and some, when it had brought them in ships over the great sea  gulf to Troy for rich-haired Helen's sake: there death's end enshrouded  a part of them. But to the others father Zeus the son of Cronos gave a  living and an abode apart from men, and made them dwell at the ends of  earth. And they live untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed  along the shore of deep swirling Ocean, happy heroes for whom the  grain-giving earth bears honey-sweet fruit flourishing thrice a year,  far from the deathless gods, and Cronos rules over them [1305]; for  the father of men and gods released him from his bonds. And these last  equally have honour and glory.    (ll. 169c-169d) And again far-seeing Zeus made yet another generation,  the fifth, of men who are upon the bounteous earth.    (ll. 170-201) Thereafter, would that I were not among the men of the  fifth generation, but either had died before or been born afterwards.  For now truly is a race of iron, and men never rest from labour and  sorrow by day, and from perishing by night; and the gods shall lay sore  trouble upon them. But, notwithstanding, even these shall have some good  mingled with their evils. And Zeus will destroy this race of mortal  men also when they come to have grey hair on the temples at their birth  [1306]. The father will not agree with his children, nor the children  with their father, nor guest with his host, nor comrade with comrade;  nor will brother be dear to brother as aforetime. Men will dishonour  their parents as they grow quickly old, and will carp at them, chiding  them with bitter words, hard-hearted they, not knowing the fear of the  gods. They will not repay their aged parents the cost their nurture, for  might shall be their right: and one man will sack another's city. There  will be no favour for the man who keeps his oath or for the just or  for the good; but rather men will praise the evil-doer and his violent  dealing. Strength will be right and reverence will cease to be; and the  wicked will hurt the worthy man, speaking false words against him, and  will swear an oath upon them. Envy, foul-mouthed, delighting in evil,  with scowling face, will go along with wretched men one and all. And  then Aidos and Nemesis [1307], with their sweet forms wrapped in white  robes, will go from the wide-pathed earth and forsake mankind to join  the company of the deathless gods: and bitter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34804"],[0,"Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion as Illustrated (#8)"],[1,"the world, or gazed into  the mirror of polished crystal that he held in his hand, in which all  the actions of men were reflected. He was a stern god of judgment, with  whose being ideas of moral retribution were associated. He was therefore  much dreaded. Up to a certain point he reminds us of the Vedic Varuna.  His statue was made of dark obsidian rock, and his face recalled that of  the bear or tapir. Suspended to his hair, which was plaited into a tail  and enclosed in a golden net, there hung an ear, which was likewise made  of gold, towards which there mounted flocks of smoke in the form of  tongues. These were the prayers and supplications of mortals. Maladies,  famines and death, were the manifestations of Tezcatlipoca's justice.  Dry as the season over which he presided, he was not easily moved. And  yet he was not absolutely inexorable. The ardent prayers, the sacrifices  and the supplications of his priests might avert the strokes of his  wrath. But in spite of all, he was pre-eminently the god of austere law.  And this is why he was regarded as the civilizing and organizing deity  of the Aztecs. It was he who had established the laws that governed the  people and who watched over their observance. In this capacity he made  frequent journeys of inspection, like an invisible prefect of police,  through the city of Mexico, to see what was going on there. Stone seats  had been erected in the streets for him to rest upon on these  occasions, and no mortal would have dared to occupy them. At the same  time a terrible and cruel subtlety in the means he employed to  accomplish his ends was attributed to him; and the legend about him,  which is far less brilliant than that of his brother Uitzilopochtli, led  several Europeans to believe that he was simply an ancient magician who  had spread terror around him by his sorceries. All this we see  exemplified in his conflicts with a third great deity whom we shall next  describe. In any case we may define Tezcatlipoca as another  determination of the Sun, and specifically of the winter Sun of the  cold, dry, sterile season.[13]    The third great deity is Quetzalcoatl, that is to say \"the feathered  serpent,\" or \"the serpent-bird;\" and it is specially noteworthy, in  connection with the elevated rank which he occupied in the Mexican  pantheon, that he was not an Aztec deity, but one of the ancient gods of  the invaded country. He was in fact a Toltec deity, and we recognize in  his name, as well as in the special notes in the legend concerning him,  that god of the wind whom we know already in Central America under the  varying names of Cuculcan, Hurakan, Gucumatz, Votan and so forth. He is  almost always a serpent, and a serpent with feathers. His temple at  Mexico departed altogether from the pyramidal type that we have  described. It was dome-shaped and covered. The entrance was formed by a  great serpent-mouth, wide open and showing its fangs, so that the  Spaniards thought it represented a gate of hell. Quetzalcoatl's priests  were clothed in white, whereas the ordinary garb of the Mexican priests  was black. There was something mysterious and occult about the  priesthood of this deity, as though it were possessed of divine secrets  or promises, the importance of which it would be dangerous to  undervalue. A special aversion to human sacrifice, and especially to the  frightful abuse of the practice amongst the Aztecs, was attributed to  this god and his priests, in passive protest, as it were, against the  sanguinary rites to which the Aztecs attributed the prosperity of their  empire.    The legend of Quetzalcoatl, as the Aztecs transmitted it to the  Spaniards, is a motley concatenation of euhemerized myths. Its  historical basis is the continuous retreat of the Toltecs before the  northern invaders, with their god Tezcatlipoca. This latter deity  becomes a magician, cunning and malicious enough to get the better of  the gentle Quetzalcoatl on every occasion. I regret that time will not  allow me to tell in detail of the combat between Tezcatlipoca and  Quetzalcoatl. The latter was a sovereign who lived long ago at Tulla,  the northern focus of Toltec civilization. Under his sceptre men lived  in great happiness and enjoyed abundance of everything. He had taught  them agriculture, the use of the metals, the art of cutting stone, the  means of fixing the calendar; and being opposed to the sacrifice of  human victims--note this--he had advised their replacement by the  drawing of blood from the tongue, the lips, the chest, the legs, &c.  Tezcatlipoca succeeded by his enchantments in destroying this rule of  peace and prosperity, and forced Quetzalcoatl to quit Tulla, which  thereupon fell in ruins. He then pursued him into Cholula, the ancient  sacred city of the Toltecs, in which he had sought refuge, and in which  he had again made happiness and abundance reign. Finally, he forced him  to quit the continent altogether, and embark in a mysterious vessel not  far from Vera Cruz, near to the very spot where Cortes disembarked.  Since then Quetzalcoatl had disappeared; \"But wait!\" said his priests,  \"for he will return.\" This expectation of Quetzalcoatl's return  furnishes a kind of parallel to the Messianic hope, or more closely yet  to the early Christian expectation of the _parousia_ or \"second coming\"  of the Christ. For when he returned, it would be to punish his enemies,  to chastise the wicked, the oppressors and the tyrants. And that is why  the Aztecs dreaded his return, and why they had not dared to proscribe  his cultus, but, on the contrary, recognized it and carried it on. And  if you would know the real secret of the success of Fernando Cortes in  his wild enterprize--for, after all, the Mexican sovereign could easily  have crushed him and his handful of men, by making a hecatomb of them  before they had had time to entrench themselves and make allies--you  will find it in the fact that Montezuma, whose conscience was oppressed  with more crimes than one, had a very lively dread of Quetzalcoatl's  return; and when he was informed that at the very point where the  dreaded god had embarked, to disappear in the unknown East, strange and  terrible beings had been seen to disembark, bearing with them fragments  of thunderbolts, in tubes that they could discharge whenever they  would--some of them having two heads and six legs, swifter of foot than  the fleetest men--Montezuma could not doubt that--it was Quetzalcoatl  returning, and instead of sending his troops against Cortes, he  preferred to negotiate with him, to allow him to approach, and to  receive him in his own palace. And although doubts soon asserted  themselves in his mind, yet he long retained, perhaps even to the last,  a superstitious dread of Cortes, that enabled the latter to secure a  complete ascendancy over him. This, I repeat, was the secret of the bold  Spaniard's success; nor can we ever understand the matter rightly unless  we take into consideration the significance of this worship of  Quetzalcoatl that the Aztecs had continued to respect, though all the  while flattering themselves that their own god, Tezcatlipoca, would be  able once more to protect them against his ancient adversary. Years  after the conquest, Father Sahagun had still to answer the question of  the natives, who asked him what he knew of the country of  Quetzalcoatl.[14]    What, then, was the fundamental significance of this feathered Serpent  that so pre-occupied the religious consciousness of the Aztecs?    He was not the Sun. The Sun does not disappear in the East. He was a god  of the wind, as Father Sahagun perfectly well understood, but of that  wind in particular that brings over the parched land of Mexico the tepid  and fertilizing exhalations of the Atlantic. And this is why  Tezcatlipoca, the god of the cold and dry season, rather than  Uitzilopochtli, is his personal enemy. It is towards the end of the dry  season that the fertilizing showers begin to fall on the eastern shores,  and little by little to reach the higher lands of the interior. The  flying Serpent, then, the wind that comes like a huge bird upon the air,  bringing life and abundance with it, is a benevolent deity who spreads  prosperity wherever he goes. But he does not always breathe over the  land, and does not carry his blessed moisture everywhere. Tezcatlipoca  appears. The lofty plateaux of Tulla, of Mexico and of Cholula, are the  first victims of his desolating force. Quetzalcoatl withdraws ever  further and further to the East, and at last disappears in the great  ocean.    Such is the natural basis of the myth of Quetzalcoatl, and the  justification of my remark that we find in him the pendant of those  deities, serpents and birds in one, who were adored in Central America,  and who answered, like Quetzalcoatl, to the idea of the Atlantic wind.  He was, in truth, the ancient deity that the Nahuas or Mayas of the  civilized immigrations brought with them when they settled in Anahuac  and still further North. Like all the other gods of these regions,  Quetzalcoatl had assumed the human shape more and more completely. We  still possess, especially in the Trocadero Museum at Paris, great blocks  of stone on which he is represented as a serpent covered with feathers,  coiled up and sleeping till the time comes for him to wake. But there  are also statues of him in human form, save that his body is surmounted  by a bird's head, with the tongue projected. Now in the Mexican  hieroglyphie this bird's head, with the tongue put out, is no other than  the symbol of the wind. Hence, too, his names of _Tohil_ \"the hummer\" or  \"the whisperer,\" _Ehecatl_ \"the breeze,\" _Nauihehecatl_ \"the lord of the  four winds,\" &c. The naturalistic meaning of Quetzalcoatl, then, cannot  admit of the smallest doubt.    It is probably to the more gentle and humane religious tendency which  was kept alive by the priesthood of this deity, that we"]]]
