Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall  fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt  them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of  the rocks.\" Now it has ever been the case with Israel, when they  wished to express the greatness of their God, to say, The Lord liveth,  which brought up our fathers out of the land of Egypt. This saying at  once called to mind the power and miracles of that memorable event,  and associated with it all that was great and grand, and was  calculated to strike the mind with awe, under a lively sense of the  power of Israel's God. But, to our astonishment, something is yet to  transpire which will cast into momentary forgetfulness all the great  events of that day, and the children of Israel shall know that their  God liveth, by casting their minds upon events of recent date, which  shall have transpired, still more glorious and wonderful than their  coming out of Egypt. They will exclaim, The Lord liveth, which  recently brought the children of Israel from the north, and from all  lands whither He had driven them, and hath planted them in the land of  Canaan, which He gave our fathers. With this idea will be associated  every display of grandeur and sublimity, of wonder and amazement;  while they call to mind the revelations, manifestations, miracles and  mercies displayed in bringing about this great event, in the eyes of  all the nations. In view of this, Jeremiah exclaims, in the last verse  of this chapter: \"Therefore, behold, I will _this once_ cause them to  know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall  know that my name is the Lord.\"    But the means made use of to bring about this glorious event are, not  only the raising of a standard, the lifting up of an ensign, so that  we may know when the time is fulfilled, but fishers and hunters are to  be employed to fish and hunt them from every mountain, from every  hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. Let the reader mark here: men  were not to send missionaries, who were not inspired, to go and teach  Israel several hundred different doctrines, and opinions of men, and  to tell them they supposed the time had about arrived for them to  gather; but the God of heaven is to call men by actual revelation,  direct from heaven, and to tell them who Israel is; who the Indians of  America are, if they should be of Israel; and also where the ten  tribes are, and all the scattered remnants of that long lost people.  He it is who is to give them their errand and mission, and to clothe  them with power from on high to execute the great work, in defiance of  opposing elements, and all the opposition of earth and hell combined.  But do you ask: \"Why is the Lord to commission men by actual  revelation?\" I reply, because He has no other way of sending men in  any age. \"No man,\" says the Apostle, \"taketh this honor upon himself,  but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.\" Now, we all acknowledge  that Aaron was called by revelation.    Now the great Jehovah never did, nor never will, acknowledge the  priesthood or ministry of any man who is not called by revelation, and  inspired, as in days of old. But, \"O!\" says the reader, \"you startle  me, for the whole train of modern divines profess no revelation later  than the Bible, and no direct inspiration or supernatural gift of the  Spirit. Do you cast them all off, and say that they have no  authority?\" I reply, No, for the Bible does it, and I only humbly  acquiesce in the decision, as they are nowhere known in the Scripture,  except as teachers whom the people have heaped to themselves (the word  heap does not mean a few, but many). But to prove more fully that God  will give revelations in order to bring about this glorious work, we  will refer you to Ezekiel xx, 33-38. It reads: \"As I live, saith the  Lord God, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and  with fury poured out, will I rule over you; and I will bring you out  from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye  are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and  with fury poured out. And I will bring you into the wilderness of the  people, and there will I plead with you face to face. Like as I  pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so  will I plead with you, saith the Lord God, And I will cause you to  pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the  covenant, and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them  that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the country  where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel;  and ye shall know that I am the Lord.\"    You discover that this promise begins with a double assurance: first,  with an oath, _as I live_; second, with an assurance, _surely, with a  mighty hand_, etc. And, in the close of the same chapter, lest the  people should possibly misunderstand him, he exclaims: \"O Lord, they  say of me, doth he not speak in parables?\" Here we have the children  of Israel brought from among all nations, with a mighty hand and a  stretched out arm, and with fury poured out (O ye nations who oppose  these things, beware, remember Pharaoh, and learn wisdom), we see them  brought into the wilderness of the people; and there the Lord is to  plead with them, face to face, just as he did with their fathers in  the wilderness of Egypt. This pleading face to face can never be done  without revelation, and a personal manifestation, as much so as in old  times. Now I ask, were all His manifestations to Israel in the  wilderness mere fables not to be understood literally? If so, this  will be so too; for one will be precisely like the other, no parable,  but a glorious reality. He will cause them to pass under the rod, and  bring them into the bond of the covenant.    This brings to mind the new covenant so often promised in the  Scriptures, to be made with the house of Israel and with the house of  Judah, just in time to gather them from their long dispersion. Some  may suppose that the new covenant which was to gather Israel made its  appearance in the days of Christ and his Apostles. But Paul tells us  it was yet future in his day. So, in his eleventh chapter to the  Romans, he says, \"that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until  the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and so all Israel shall be  saved; as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer,  and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob, for this is my covenant  unto them, when I shall take away their sins.\" From this we learn that  Paul placed that covenant in the future, even down to the restoration  of Israel, in the last days, when the times of the Gentiles should be  fulfilled. Then there should come a Deliverer for Israel, and not  before, seeing that they had rejected the first coming of that  Deliverer. And he himself said to the Jews: \"Behold, your house is  left unto you desolate; for I say unto you, ye shall not see me  henceforth till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of  the Lord.\" Then, and not until then, should the covenant be renewed  with Israel. And even when the Apostles inquired, saying, \"Wilt thou  at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?\" the Savior made  answer, that it was not for them to know the times and seasons which  the Father had put in His own power; but they were to receive power,  and bear witness of Him, etc.; as much as to say, that work is not for  you Apostles to accomplish, but shall be done in the Lord's own time,  by whom He will; but go ye and do the work I have commanded you.    Again, Isaiah, lxi, 8, 9, in speaking of this covenant, tells us that  it should make their seed known among the Gentiles, and their  offspring among the people; and should cause all that see them to  acknowledge them that they are the seed that the Lord hath blessed.  Now, we know that it is a question which can only be decided by  revelation, whether the aborigines of America are the seed of Jacob or  not. Again, it is a matter of uncertainty where the ten tribes are, or  who they are; but the new covenant, whenever it makes its appearance,  will reveal these things, and will leave the matter no longer in  suspense; we shall then know their seed among the Gentiles, and their  offspring among the people. But, O! how different was the effect of  the covenant made eighteen hundred years ago in its effects upon  Israel; it cast them off in unbelief, and caused all that have seen  them or heard of them ever since to acknowledge that they are the seed  that the Lord hath _cursed_. When the covenant is renewed in the last  days, the Lord will bring them into the bond of the covenant, by  manifesting Himself to them face to face. Let me inquire, How does God  make a covenant with the people in any age? The answer is, By  communicating His will to them by actual revelation; for, without  this, it would be impossible to make a covenant between two parties.  In order to illustrate this subject, let us bring an example. We see  how we make covenants with each other. For instance, a young man  wishes to enter into a covenant of matrimony with a young lady; but  deprive him of the privilege of revealing his mind to her, cut off all  direct communication between them, and a covenant could never be made;  and so it is with the Almighty. He never did enter into a covenant  with His creatures, without revelations; and He never can do it. In  short, whenever He made a covenant with the people, where a whole  people were concerned, He included in the covenant the priesthood,  offices, and authorities, together with the ordinances and blessings  which pertain to His covenant; and so will He do at this time.  Whenever the new covenant is established, it will organize the kingdom  of God with all its offices, ordinances,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3567"],[0,"Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte — Complete (#8)"],[1,"to Paris. He had attained  the proper age, and the report of him was favourable, therefore he was  very naturally included among the number of the five who were chosen in  1784.    In a biographical account of Bonaparte I have read the following  anecdote:--When he was fourteen years of age he happened to be at a  party where some one pronounced a high eulogium on Turenne; and a lady  in the company observed that he certainly was a great man, but that  she should like him better if he had not burned the Palatinate. \"What  signifies that,\" replied Bonaparte, \"if it was necessary to the object  he had in view?\"    This is either an anachronism or a mere fabrication. Bonaparte was  fourteen in the year 1783. He was then at Brienne, where certainly he  did not go into company, and least of all the company of ladies.            CHAPTER II.     1784-1794.

Bonaparte was fifteen years and two months old when he went to the  Military College of Paris.         --[Madame Junot relates some interesting particulars connected with     Napoleon's first residence in Paris:     \"My mother's first care,\" says she, \"on arriving in Paris was to     inquire after Napoleon Bonaparte. He was at that time in the     military school at Paris, having quitted Brienne in the September of     the preceding year.       \"My uncle Demetrius had met him just after he alighted from the coach     which brought him to town; 'And truly.' said my uncle, 'he had the     appearance of a fresh importation. I met him in the Palms Royal,     where he was gaping and staring with wonder at everything he saw.     He would have been an excellent subject for sharpers, if, indeed, he     had had anything worth taking!' My uncle invited him to dine at his     house; for though my uncle was a bachelor, he did not choose to dine     at a 'traiteur' (the name 'restaurateur' was not then introduced).     He told my mother that Napoleon was very morose. 'I fear,' added     he, 'that that young man has more self-conceit than is suitable to     his condition. When he dined with me he began to declaim violently     against the luxury of the young men of the military school. After a     little he turned the conversation on Mania, and the present     education of the young Maniotes, drawing a comparison between it and     the ancient Spartan system of education. His observations on this     head he told me he intended to embody in a memorial to be presented     to the Minister of War. All this, depend upon it, will bring him     under the displeasure of his comrades; and it will be lucky if he     escape being run through.' A few days afterwards my mother saw     Napoleon, and then his irritability was at its height. He would     scarcely bear any observations, even if made in his favour, and I am     convinced that it is to this uncontrollable irritability that he     owed the reputation of having been ill-tempered in his boyhood, and     splenetic in his youth. My father, who was acquainted with almost     all the heads of the military school, obtained leave for him     sometimes to come out for recreation. On account of an accident (a     sprain, if I recollect rightly) Napoleon once spent a whole week at     our house. To this day, whenever I pass the Quai Conti, I cannot     help looking up at a 'mansarde' at the left angle of the house on     the third floor. That was Napoleon's chamber when he paid us a     visit, and a neat little room it was. My brother used to occupy the     one next to it. The two young men were nearly of the same age: my     brother perhaps had the advantage of a year or fifteen months. My     mother had recommended him to cultivate the friendship of young     Bonaparte; but my brother complained how unpleasant it was to find     only cold politeness where he expected affection. This     repulsiveness on the part of Napoleon was almost offensive, and must     have been sensibly felt by my brother, who was not only remarkable     for the mildness of his temper and the amenity and grace of his     manner, but whose society was courted in the most distinguished     circles of Paris on account of his accomplishments. He perceived in     Bonaparte a kind of acerbity and bitter irony, of which he long     endeavoured to discover the cause. 'I believe,' said Albert one day     to my mother, 'that the poor young man feels keenly his dependent     situation.'\" ('Memoirs of the Duchesse d'Abrantes, vol. i. p. 18,     edit. 1883).]--    I accompanied him in a carriole as far as Nogent Sur Seine, whence the  coach was to start. We parted with regret, and we did not meet again  till the year 1792. During these eight years we maintained an active  correspondence; but so little did I anticipate the high destiny which,  after his elevation, it was affirmed the wonderful qualities of his  boyhood plainly denoted, that I did not preserve one of the letters  he wrote to me at that period, but tore them up as soon as they were  answered.         --[I remember, however, that in a letter which I received from him     about a year after his arrival in Paris he urged me to keep my     promise of entering the army with him. Like him, I had passed     through the studies necessary for the artillery service; and in 1787     I went for three months to Metz, in order to unite practice with     theory. A strange Ordinance, which I believe was issued in 1778 by     M. de Segur, required that a man should possess four quarterings of     nobility before he could be qualified to serve his king and country     as a military officer. My mother went to Paris, taking with her the     letters patent of her husband, who died six weeks after my birth.     She proved that in the year 1640 Louis XIII. had, by letters     patent, restored the titles of one Fauvelet de Villemont, who in     1586 had kept several provinces of Burgundy subject to the king's     authority at the peril of his life and the loss of his property; and     that his family had occupied the first places in the magistracy     since the fourteenth century. All was correct, but it was observed     that the letters of nobility had not been registered by the     Parliament, and to repair this little omission, the sum of twelve     thousand francs was demanded. This my mother refused to pay, and     there the matter rested.]--    On his arrival at the Military School of Paris, Bonaparte found  the establishment on so brilliant and expensive a footing that he  immediately addressed a memorial on the subject to the Vice-Principal  Berton of Brienne.         --[A second memoir prepared by him to the same effect was intended     for the Minister of War, but Father Berton wisely advised silence to     the young cadet (Iung, tome i. p. 122). Although believing in the     necessity of show and of magnificence in public life, Napoleon     remained true to these principles. While lavishing wealth on his     ministers and marshals, \"In your private life,\" said be, \"be     economical and even parsimonious; in public be magnificent\"     (Meneval, tome i. p. 146).]--    He showed that the plan of education was really pernicious, and far from  being calculated to fulfil the object which every wise government must  have in view. The result of the system, he said, was to inspire  the pupils, who were all the sons of poor gentlemen, with a love of  ostentation, or rather, with sentiments of vanity and self-sufficiency;  so that, instead of returning happy to the bosom of their families, they  were likely to be ashamed of their parents, and to despise their humble  homes. Instead of the numerous attendants by whom they were surrounded,  their dinners of two courses, and their horses and grooms, he suggested  that they should perform little necessary services for themselves, such  as brushing their clothes, and cleaning their boots and shoes; that  they should eat the coarse bread made for soldiers, etc. Temperance and  activity, he added, would render them robust, enable them to bear the  severity of different seasons and climates, to brave the fatigues of  war, and to inspire the respect and obedience of the soldiers under  their command. Thus reasoned Napoleon at the age of sixteen, and time  showed that he never deviated from these principles. The establishment  of the military school at Fontainebleau is a decided proof of this.    As Napoleon was an active observer of everything passing around him, and  pronounced his opinion openly and decidedly, he did not remain long at  the Military School of Paris. His superiors, who were anxious to get rid  of him, accelerated the period of his examination, and he obtained the  first vacant sub-lieutenancy in a regiment of artillery.    I left Brienne in 1787; and as I could not enter the artillery,  I proceeded in the following year to Vienna, with a letter of  recommendation to M. de Montmorin, soliciting employment in the French  Embassy at the Court of Austria.    I remained two months at Vienna, where I had the honour of twice seeing  the Emperor Joseph. The impression made upon me by his kind reception,  his dignified and elegant manners, and graceful conversation, will never  be obliterated from my recollection. After M. de Noailles had initiated  me in the first steps of diplomacy, he advised me to go to one of the  German"]]]
