He knows accurately the  original cost in money of each, and how much each would be likely to  sell for in case it were brought to the hammer. All this is, of course,  good and solid information, but it is too microscopically minute and  exact to interest anyone outside a very small circle.  To most of us  these details are unimportant, and yet every lucky find must pass some  specialist, who assigns to it its proper position in point of  excellence, and makes it keep its place.  For this reason I have been  charged with the offence of speaking about him as though he were a  common bookworm, ready to feed on anything that came in his way, which  is, of course, flat treason, not by any means to be silently borne by  the elite.                                       *CHAPTER IV.*                         *THE FORGOTTEN LORE SOCIETY.*      Common-sense tells us that 'finds,' as they are popularly called, must  necessarily be made by the purest of accidents. Valuables of any kind,  though frequently lost or mislaid, seldom remain unappropriated for  long, and to search for them with intent is to be too late in such a  large preponderance of cases that it is not worth while to go to the  trouble of doing so.  A 'find,' as I take the word to mean in a popular  sense, is the discovery of something of special interest or value,  followed by its acquisition at a price which is, at market rates, very  much less than it is worth.  The price paid is the gist of the find in  the popular eye, though there is no denying that, in the case of genuine  literature, this is about the most unsatisfactory view that can be taken  of the matter.    If an extremely scarce or interesting book, for which one has, perhaps,  been searching for years, is at last acquired at any price whatever, the  'find' is none the less real, merely because the cost is great, though  we should have hard work to convince the ordinary book-buyer that this  is so.  He is of opinion that money can buy anything, books not  excepted, and in that he is assuredly wrong, for there are many books  which are not to be procured at any price, simply because they have  disappeared as though they had never been.  We know they once lived,  because they are referred to by name in contemporary reviews, or have  perhaps been reprinted; but now they are as dead as the 'Original  Poetry' of Victor and Cazire, which can be traced to the pages of the  _Morning Chronicle_ of September 18, 1810, and to a couple of reviews of  the day, but of which no copy is now known.    It was this 'Original Poetry' that first suggested the idea of a society  to promote the systematic search for 'rare and curious volumes of  forgotten lore,' as Edgar Poe felicitously has it.  These poems were the  production of Shelley and a friend--probably his cousin, Harriet  Grove--but had hardly been published a week when Stockdale, the  publisher, inspecting the book with more attention than he previously  had leisure to bestow, recognised one of the pieces as having been taken  bodily from 'The Monk.'  Shelley then suppressed the entire edition in  disgust, but not before nearly a hundred copies had been put into  circulation. The question is, Where are these derelicts now? It is  incomprehensible that all can have been consigned to the flames or torn  to pulp. Most probably one at least has survived the wrack of time and  neglect, and may be lying perdu in the garret or rubbish-heap of some  old farmhouse, in which Shelley is but little known, and 'Victor' and  'Cazire' absolute strangers both.  And if this particular book, why not  many others, which, though not absolutely lost, are yet so very rarely  met with that it is the ambition of every book-hunter, great or small,  to track them down?    As the world is not inhabited entirely by specialists, the inference is  that books of all kinds, good as well as indifferent, lie hidden away in  obscure places, waiting the coming of some appreciative explorer who  will rescue them from the neglect of many years, and restore them to the  world from whence they came.  It is no use advertising in these cases.  Every week, year in and year out, stereotyped advertisements appear in  all sorts of likely and unlikely journals, and nothing ever seems to  come of them.  They are read, doubtless, by the very people whose goods  and chattels stand in need of a thorough overhauling; but they do not  know the real extent of their possessions, and usually have a fine  contempt for articles of small bulk--a by no means unusual circumstance,  be it said, even in educated circles, for it is on record that, when  Sion College was burned down, many priceless volumes in the library were  destroyed simply because the attendants, at the risk of their lives,  devoted all the time available to the rescue of folios.    Thus it came to pass that Prynne's miscellaneous writings were for the  most part saved, while other treatises, of far more importance, but  smaller in size, were licked up by the flames, and so perished.  The  natural instinct of human beings is to place confidence in weight, and  to ascribe wisdom to bulk.  For centuries this idea prevailed throughout  Europe, and doubtless prompted Nicolai de Lyra to write those hundreds  of folios of commentary on the New Testament which at one time were the  mournful heritage of thousands.  So also the great Baxter reaped much  renown by reason of his seventy folios or quartos, causing Bayle to  remark, 'Perhaps no copying clerk who ever lived to grow old amidst the  dust of an office ever transcribed so much as this author has written.'    The real book-hunter of to-day is, however, fortunately free of the  ancient superstition, and knows very well that as a general rule the  scarcest printed books are those which are small in size.  To the people  at large this is not so, and thus it is that pamphlets of extreme  rarity, small volumes which you can hold in your hand with ease, or  carry in an inner pocket with comfort, are neglected and eventually  forgotten, and doubtless destroyed in sheer ignorance, more often than  we care to think of.  It was with the object of rescuing some of these  that the Forgotten Lore Society first saw the light seven years ago.  This, indeed, was not its real name, but the title is a good one, and as  descriptive of the objects sought to be attained as any other that could  be invented.  The idea was to search the country for neglected books in  the hope that something at least might be discovered among the heaps of  ancestral rubbish that time and the elements are fast bringing to decay.    Now, I venture to state that the more anyone of impartial judgment  considers facts and probabilities, the more he must be satisfied that  this was no Quixotic scheme.  In some instances it is plain that even  the most protracted and thorough search would be mere waste of time, as,  for instance, in the case of Byron's 'Fugitive Pieces,' 1806, which is  known to have been entirely destroyed, with the exception of three  copies, all of which can be accounted for.  But, then, the operations of  the society were not confined to odd volumes, but to rarities of any  kind and in any number that Providence might see fit to throw in its  way.  If not Byron, then Shelley, or Burns, or those older authors whose  very names are synonyms for extreme scarcity, such, for example, as  Brereton, Whitbourne, W. Hamond, Bullinger, and the scores who have  written seventeenth-century poems and composed old music to sing them  to.  Have all practically vanished, or are they merely under the lock of  a combination of indifference and ignorance for a time?  That was the  question.    With this society I was connected as an ordinary member, and allotted a  certain acreage over which to roam, on the distinct understanding that  any advantage was to accrue to the benefit of the members as a whole.  Elaborate rules were drawn up, and every imaginable contingency fully  provided for.  There was no lack of money, and no want of enterprise or  enthusiasm; yet the project failed for the simplest of all reasons--but  one which had apparently never entered into the calculations of the  promoters.  Spread over England, and some parts of Scotland and Ireland,  were over a hundred book-men, all of them thoroughly well versed in  literature of a certain kind, but, with few exceptions, rigorous  specialists, who affected particular authors or subjects, and knew  little outside the restricted circle they had made their own.  Let any  one of these be drawn within the vortex of his favourite branch of  study, and I am sure that he would have acquitted himself admirably; but  what was wanted in a matter of this kind was a general and extensive  acquaintance with the market, and not a knowledge, however deep or  profound, of the lives of authors long since dead, and of what they  wrote, and the circumstances that attended the publication of their  works.  This, unfortunately, was the information with which most of the  members set out to search the countryside, and the mistakes they made  would be sufficient to excite the laughter of even the tyro were they  but published. A perfect Iliad of woes tracked the footsteps of each  member of this society wherever he went, and it is not at all surprising  that it eventually languished and was finally dissolved.  A few of these  mistakes may, however, be set down with the object of showing how easy  it is to tumble into error, and at the same time to be perfectly  satisfied that the mistake, if any, is on the wrong shoulders.    Every collector of Mr. Ruskin's works knows that on December 14, 1864,  he delivered a lecture at the Town Hall, Manchester, and that this  lecture was printed and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46303"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 6 (of 8) (#8)"],[1,"a new charger. He joined his  regiment in time to lead to the attack, but taking a more northerly  direction than was intended, he found himself exposed to a murderous  tornado from the southern slopes of Diamond Hill. Nevertheless, the  charge of the valiant band, small though it now was, had a glorious  result. Away scudded the Boers to both sides, scattering over the  distance towards Diamond Hill, while their oppressive propinquity to the  British guns and Broadwood's right flank was brought to an abrupt close.  This done, Lord Airlie decided, as the horses were too jaded and  overworked to engage in effective pursuit, to become no further involved.  He was about to withdraw his regiment when suddenly a bullet caught him,  and, almost instantly, he fell dead. Thus the Empire lost one of its  finest soldiers, one of its most honourable, well-beloved of men.[2] The  charge cost the regiment two officers and seventeen troopers, a  deplorable loss considering its diminished size since the commencement of  operations. At the same hour, while Gordon's Brigade was heavily engaged  on the right, the Boers became so obstreperous that the Household Cavalry  had been ordered to charge. This order was obeyed with zest. The  Dutchmen, numerous as they were, took in at a glance all that was meant  by the approaching whirlwind--a flashing avalanche of naked blades--and  turned tail. Away they fled over their grassy ridges, seized their horses  and made off so quickly that none of the Lifeguardsmen and few of their  chargers were sacrificed to the dashing exploit. It was thought that the  whole body of the foe were on the move, but this was not the case. The  congregating crowds of the enemy amid the scrub-covered ridges around the  main position had yet to be cleared off. Accordingly, soon after noon,  the 21st Brigade (Bruce Hamilton) advanced, cleverly clambering up the  crests, which had previously been scoured by artillery, and finally  succeeded in folding back the formidable wave of Dutchmen which guarded  the line, and forcing them, such as could escape, amid a hurricane of  bullets, to gallop to fresh cover. Dusk set in early, but the troops,  sticking to the ground they had won, covering a front of some 25 miles,  there bivouacked for the night.    [Illustration: _Scale, Diagram is about 16 miles square._    BATTLE OF DIAMOND HILL--POSITION ON 11TH JUNE[3]]    Early the next day (the 12th) the Dutch overture began, the foe operating  vigorously with their long-range guns. They were evidently unappeased,  and meant a dogged resistance. General Ian Hamilton was among the first  to be hit, but not dangerously. The incident caused not a little concern,  for this remarkably energetic officer had become, as it were, almost  hoary with fighting the Boers. From early days when he commanded the  infantry at Elandslaagte to the splendid defence at Wagon Hill he had  been eternally to the fore, brilliant in intellect and unfailing in dash  and daring. After his entry to the Free State he had fought his way from  Israel's Poort, Thabanchu, Houtnek, and on through all the varied phases  of the advance of the right wing of the army towards Pretoria. It was no  marvel that the thought of his even temporary disablement caused  consternation. Fortunately it was discovered that no bones were broken,  and the gallant officer, though in some pain, refused to leave the field.    [Illustration: BATTLE OF DIAMOND HILL--POSITION ON 12TH JUNE]    At midday General Bruce Hamilton's Brigade made a brilliant attack on the  Diamond Hill plateau. The Derbyshires to the right, the City Imperial  Volunteers in the middle, the Sussex on their left, grandly advanced amid  an enfilading fire of considerable warmth, which only ceased its horrible  activity when the 82nd Field Battery, under Major Conolly, by a feat of  herculean energy, was dragged to the rocky heights, and vomited vengeance  at a distance of 1700 yards from the stubborn enemy. But though it  ultimately had the effect of silencing the Boers, it did not accomplish  its arduous task without grievous loss. Gunners were hit on all sides,  and horses dropped in the moment of unlimbering, but the gallant work  never ceased, and, though a scene of carnage reigned around, the guns  with unflinching and heroic persistence continued to pour on the hills  their cleansing fires for two mortal hours. In the late afternoon the  Guards came into action, and more guns, the Boers having rapidly taken up  a position near the railway, and to the drumming of mighty pieces and the  whistling tune of musketry the twilight set in. Face to face the  belligerents grew lost in mist. Preparations were then made for the  complete rout of the Boers on the morrow, but when morning arrived it was  found that the Dutch hordes had made themselves scarce. Pursuit was  attempted, but the horses were too exhausted for more heavy work. The  Westtralians, however--150 of them belonging to Colonel de Lisle's  Corps--were unappeased. They pushed on to a point whence the Boer army, a  crowd of some 4000, with waggons, cattle, and guns, could be seen  crossing Bronkher's Spruit. That place of grievous memories, where  Colonel Anstruther[4] fell victim to Boer perfidy, awoke its own ghosts,  for scarcely had the Dutchmen reached the fatal area than an avenging  sleet from the magazines of the Westtralians brought them to a state of  panic. In an instant Dutchmen, waggons, guns, were scattering in all  directions, while the Colonials, expending 20,000 rounds of ammunition,  coolly plied their rifles in their coign of vantage till the numbers of  the enemy were sensibly thinned by death, wounds, or flight. Thus was  given the finishing touch to a battle which had a double purpose. It  served to clear the way for forty miles to the east and relieve Pretoria  of the too close attentions of the massed enemy, and it engaged many of  the Boers who had fallen back from Laing's Nek on the taking of Pretoria,  thus assisting General Buller's operations at Volksrust, which have yet  to be described. Sir Redvers, in his turn, aided the main scheme by  causing the Boers to feel that their rear would shortly be threatened,  and that even retreat to the east must now have its geographical limits.    [Illustration: LIEUT.-COLONEL THE EARL OF AIRLIE (12th Lancers)    Killed at Battle of Diamond Hill, June 11th    Photo by Bassano, London]    General French was unable to fulfil his part of the programme, firstly,  because the Boers saw through his plan, and secondly, because his  Division was merely the shadow of the goodly Division that had flown to  Kimberley in February, and his operations were entirely handicapped, not  only by the nature of the country, but by the nature of his tools.  General Ian Hamilton was little better off. Broadwood's Brigade, which  once had numbered 1800, was now reduced to 400, while the Household  Cavalry mustered only 63, the 12th Lancers 120, and the 10th Hussars 200.  Not only were the regiments reduced in numbers, but their mounts were now  of the most heterogeneous description, Basuto, Argentine, and Cape ponies  doing duty for chargers, and in many cases utterly unequal to the  exertion expected of them. Without this explanation it would be difficult  to comprehend why so apparently large a force should have been unable to  do more than rout the enemy. But when it is once understood that a  considerable part of Lord Roberts's army was now represented merely _on  paper_, the difficulties of the latter part of the campaign may be better  conceived.    The C.I.V.'s had two days of stiff battle. A private, giving an account  of his experiences, declared that they were the heaviest days' fighting  he had seen. \"The C.I.V.'s were in the firing line both days, and our  casualties were about sixty. One of our lieutenants had a very sad death  just in front of my company. I have heard two names given to the action,  but I don't know which is correct; they are Diamond Hill and Donkerskoek.  Our General said it was a second Spion Kop, the Boer position being so  fine, and the firing from the trenches so heavy. Our regiment had got to  within about 400 yards of the position, and had fixed bayonets, but had  to give up the idea of charging, for if we had half the regiment would  have been swept away. One of the Boer doctors was down at our hospital  after the first day's fight, and he told us that the Boers had lost about  600 that day. They must have lost another 600 the next day, as our  artillery was much nearer, and simply poured shells into them all day.\"    The total losses were about 200, but most deeply deplored by all ranks  was the gallant commander, the Earl of Airlie. He was as brave as he was  popular, and, like all his famous fighting race, was a soldier _born_,  not made. Besides his record of previous service, he had distinguished  himself in the Modder River battle, and was twice mentioned in despatches  by Lord Methuen. On one of these occasions he made himself notable for  the splendid dash with which he dismounted a section of his men and drove  back a party of Boers who were enfilading the British force. In May he  was wounded in the fighting round Welkom, was nursed to health at  Bloemfontein by Lady Airlie, and went again to the front just before the  surrender of Pretoria. Two other distinguished officers fell: Major the  Hon. L. Fortescue, and Lieutenant the Hon. C. Cavendish, 17th Lancers.    Besides those already noted the list of casualties during the various  engagements contained the names of:--         _Killed_:--12th Lancers--Lieutenant G. C. de C. Wright. 82nd       Battery Royal Field Artillery--Second Lieutenant W. S. Luce.       New South Wales Mounted Infantry--Lieutenant Drage. 1st Royal       Sussex Regiment--Captain C. J. K. Maguire.
