Thus the Mare Humorum has swept away half the wall of the  rings, Hippalus and Doppelmayer, and far out in the open plain of the Mare  Nubium, great circles like Kies, and that immediately north of Flamsteed,  stand up in faint relief as of half-submerged rings. Clearly there was a  period after the age in which the great ring mountains and walled plains  came into existence, when an invasive flood attacked and partially  destroyed a large proportion of them. And the flood itself evidently  became more viscous and less fluid the further it spread from its original  centre of action, for the ridges and crumpling of the surface indicate  that the material found more and more difficulty in its flow.    We have evidence just as direct that there is no atmosphere. This is very  strikingly shown when the Moon, in its monthly progress among the stars,  passes before one of them and occults it. Such an occultation is  instantaneous, and is particularly impressive when either a disappearance  or a reappearance occurs at the defective limb; that is to say, at the  limb which is not illuminated by the Sun, and is therefore invisible. The  observer may have a bright star in the field of view, showing steadily in  a cloudless sky; there is not a hint of a weakening in its light; suddenly  it is gone. The first experience of such an observation is most  disconcerting; it is hardly less disconcerting to observe the reappearance  at the dark limb. One moment the field of view of the telescope is empty;  the next, without any sort of dawning, a bright star is shining steadily  in the void, and it almost seems to the observer as if an explosion had  taken place. If the Moon had an atmosphere extending upwards from its  surface in all directions and of any appreciable density, an occultation  would not be so exceedingly abrupt; and, in particular, if the occultation  were watched through a spectroscope, then, at the disappearance, the  spectrum of the star would not vanish as a whole, but the red end would go  first, and the rest of the spectrum would be swept out of sight  successively, from orange to the violet. This does not happen; the whole  spectrum goes out together, and it is clear that no appreciable atmosphere  can exist on the Moon. In actual observation so inappreciable is it that  its density at the Moon's surface is variously estimated as 1/300th of  that of the Earth by Neison, and as 1/10000th by W. H. Pickering. If the  Moon possessed an atmosphere bearing the same proportion to her total mass  as we find in the case of the Earth, she would have a density of  one-fortieth of our atmosphere at the sea level.    The Moon is at the same mean distance from the Sun as the Earth, and  therefore, surface for surface, receives from it on the average the same  amount of light and heat. But it makes a very different use of these  supplies. Bright as the Moon appears when seen at the full on some winter  night, it has really but a very low power of reflection, and is only  bright by contrast with the darkness of the midnight sky. If the full Moon  is seen in broad daylight, it is pale and ghost-like. Sir John Herschel  has put it on record that when in South Africa he often had the  opportunity of comparing the Moon with the face of Table Mountain, the Sun  shining full upon both, and the Moon appeared no brighter than the  weathered rock. The best determinations of the _albedo_ of the Moon, that  is to say, of its reflective power, give it as 0.17, so that only  one-sixth of the incident light is reflected, the other five-sixths being  absorbed. It is difficult to obtain a good determination of the Earth's  _albedo_, but the most probable estimate puts it as about 0.50, or three  times as great as that of the Moon. This high reflective power is partly  to be accounted for by the great extent of the terrestrial polar caps, but  chiefly by the clouds and dust layer always present in its atmosphere.    A larger proportion, therefore, of the solar rays are employed in heating  the soil of the Moon than in heating that of the Earth, and in this  connection the effect of an important difference between the two worlds  must be noted. The Earth rotates on its axis in 23 hours 56 minutes 4  seconds, the mean length of its rotation as referred to the Sun being 24  hours. The rotation of the Moon, on the other hand, takes 27 days 7 hours  43 minutes to accomplish, giving a mean rotation, as referred to the Sun,  of 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes. The lunar surface is therefore exposed  uninterruptedly to the solar scorching for very nearly fifteen of our days  at a time, and it is, in turn, exposed to the intense cold of outer space  for an equal period. As the surface absorbs heat so readily, it must  radiate it as quickly; hence radiation must go on with great rapidity  during the long lunar night. Lord Rosse and Prof. Very have both obtained  measures of the change in the lunar heat radiation during the progress of  a total eclipse of the Moon, with the result that the heat disappeared  almost completely, though not quite at the same time as the light. Prof.  Langley succeeded in obtaining from the Moon, far down in the long wave  lengths of the infra-red, a heat spectrum which was only partly due to  reflection from the Sun; part coming from the lunar soil itself, which,  having absorbed heat from the Sun, radiated it out again almost  immediately. In 1898, Prof. Very, following up Langley's line of work,  concluded that the temperature of the lunar soil must range through about  350 deg. Centigrade, considerably exceeding 100 deg. at the height of the lunar  day, and falling to about the temperature of liquid air during the lunar  night. So wide a range of temperature must be fatal to living organisms,  particularly when the range is repeated at short, regular intervals of  time. But this range of temperature comes directly from the length of the  Moon's rotation period; for the longer the day of the Moon, the higher the  temperature which may be attained in it; the longer the night, the greater  the cold which will in turn be experienced. We learn, therefore, that the  time of rotation of a planet is an important factor in its habitability.          CHAPTER VI    THE CANALS OF MARS      Both of the two worlds best placed for our study are thus, for different  reasons, ruled out of court as worlds for habitation. The Sun by its  vastness, its intolerable heat and the violence of its changes, has to be  rejected on the one hand, while the Moon, so small, and therefore so  rigid, unchanging and bare, is rejected on the other.    Of the other heavenly bodies, the planet Mars is the one that we see to  best advantage. Two other planets, Eros and Venus, at times come nearer to  us, but neither offers us on such occasions equal facilities for their  examination. But of Mars it has been asserted not only that it is  inhabited, but that we know it to be the case, since the evidence of the  handiwork of intelligent beings is manifest to us, even across the  tremendous gulf of forty or more million miles of space.    A claim so remarkable almost captures the position by its audacity. There  is a natural desire among men to believe the marvellous, and the very  boldness of the assertion goes no small way to overcome incredulity. And  when we consider how puny are men as we see them on this our planet, how  minute their greatest works, how superhuman any undertaking would be which  could demonstrate our existence to observers on another planet, we must  admit that it is a marvel that there should be any evidence forthcoming  that could bear one way or another on the solution of a problem so  difficult.    The first fact that we have to remember with regard to the planet Mars is  the smallness of its apparent size. To the eye it is nearly a star--a  point of light without visible surface. It is almost twice the size of the  Moon in actual diameter, but as its mean distance from the Earth is 600  times that of the Moon, its mean apparent diameter is 300 times smaller.  We cannot, however, watch Mars in all parts of its orbit; it is best  placed for observation, and, therefore, most observed, when in opposition,  and oppositions may be favourable or unfavourable. At the most favourable  opposition, Mars is 140 times as distant as the Moon; at the least  favourable, 260 times; so that on such occasions its apparent size varies  from 1/70th of the diameter of the Moon to 1/130th. But a telescope with a  magnifying power of 70 could never, under the most perfect conditions,  show Mars, even in the closest opposition, as well as the Moon is seen  with the naked eye, for the practical magnifying power of a telescope is  never as great as the theoretical. In practice, a child's spy-glass  magnifying some six diameters will show the full Moon to better advantage  than Mars has ever been seen, even in our most powerful telescopes.    The small apparent size of the planet explains how it was that Galileo  does not seem to have been able to detect any markings upon it. In 1659,  Huyghens laid the foundation stone of areography by observing some dark  spots, and determining from their apparent movements that the planet had a  rotation on its axis, which it accomplished in about the same time as the  Earth. Small and rough as are the drawings that Huyghens made, the  identification of one or two of his spots is unmistakable. Seven years  later, in 1666, both Cassini and Hooke made a number of sketches, and  those by Hooke have been repeatedly used in modern determinations of the  rotation period of the planet. The next great advance was made by Sir  William Herschel, who, during the oppositions of 1777, 1779, 1781, and  1783, determined the inclination of the axis of Mars to the plane of its  orbit, measured its polar and equatorial diameters, and ascertained the  amount of the polar "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35993"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote de la Mancha (#8)"],[1,"ing,  denoted very plainly his parentage and country, and consequently would  fix a lasting honour on that part of the world.    And now, his armour being scoured, his head-piece improved to a  helmet, his horse and himself new-named, he perceived he wanted  nothing but a lady, on whom he might bestow the empire of his heart;  for he was sensible that a knight-errant without a mistress was a tree  without either fruit or leaves, and a body without a soul. \"Should I,\"  said he to himself, \"by good or ill fortune, chance to encounter some  giant, as it is common in knight-errantry, and happen to lay him  prostrate on the ground, transfixed with my lance, or cleft in two,  or, in short, overcome him, and have him at my mercy, would it not be  proper to have some lady to whom I may send him as a trophy of my  valour? Then when he comes into her presence, throwing himself at her  feet, he may thus make his humble submission: 'Lady, I am the giant  Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania, vanquished in single  combat by that never-deservedly-enough-extolled knight-errant Don  Quixote de la Mancha, who has commanded me to cast myself most humbly  at your feet, that it may please your honour to dispose of me  according to your will.'\" Near the place where he lived dwelt a  good-looking country girl, for whom he had formerly had a sort of an  inclination, though, it is believed, she never heard of it, nor  regarded it in the least. Her name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and this was  she whom he thought he might entitle to the sovereignty of his heart;  upon which he studied to find her out a new name, that might have some  affinity with her old one, and yet at the same time sound somewhat  like that of a princess, or lady of quality; so at last he resolved to  call her Dulcinea, with the addition of del Toboso, from the place  where she was born; a name, in his opinion, sweet, harmonious, and  dignified, like the others which he had devised.          CHAPTER II.    _Which treats of Don Quixote's first sally._      These preparations being made, he found his designs ripe for action,  and thought it now a crime to deny himself any longer to the injured  world that wanted such a deliverer; the more when he considered what  grievances he was to redress, what wrongs and injuries to remove, what  abuses to correct, and what duties to discharge. So one morning before  day, in the greatest heat of July, without acquainting any one with  his design, with all the secrecy imaginable, he armed himself  cap-a-pie, laced on his ill-contrived helmet, braced on his target,  grasped his lance, mounted Rozinante, and at the private door of his  back-yard sallied out into the fields, wonderfully pleased to see with  how much ease he had succeeded in the beginning of his enterprise. But  he had not gone far ere a terrible thought alarmed him; a thought that  had like to have made him renounce his great undertaking; for now it  came into his mind, that the honour of knighthood had not yet been  conferred upon him, and therefore, according to the laws of chivalry,  he neither could nor ought to appear in arms against any professed  knight; nay, he also considered, that though he were already knighted,  it would become him to wear white armour, and not to adorn his shield  with any device, until he had deserved one by some extraordinary  demonstration of his valour.    These thoughts staggered his resolution; but his frenzy prevailing  more than reason, he resolved to be dubbed a knight by the first he  should meet, after the example of several others, who, as the romances  informed him, had formerly done the like. As for the other difficulty  about wearing white armour, he proposed to overcome it, by scouring  his own at leisure until it should look whiter than ermine. And having  thus dismissed these scruples, he rode calmly on, leaving it to his  horse to go which way he pleased; firmly believing, that in this  consisted the very essence of adventures. And as he thus went on, \"no  doubt,\" said he to himself, \"that when the history of my famous  achievements shall be given to the world, the learned author will  begin it in this very manner, when he comes to give an account of this  my setting out: 'Scarce had the ruddy Phoebus begun to spread the  golden tresses of his lovely hair over the vast surface of the earthly  globe, and scarce had those feathered poets of the grove, the pretty  painted birds, tuned their little pipes, to sing their early welcomes  in soft melodious strains to the beautiful Aurora, displaying her rosy  graces to mortal eyes from the gates and balconies of the Manchegan  horizon,--when the renowned knight Don Quixote de la Mancha,  disdaining soft repose, forsook the voluptuous down, and mounting his  famous steed Rozinante, entered the ancient and celebrated plains of  Montiel.'\" This was indeed the very road he took; and then proceeding,  \"O happy age! O fortunate times!\" cried he, \"decreed to usher into the  world my famous achievements; achievements worthy to be engraven on  brass, carved on marble, and delineated in some masterpiece of  painting, as monuments of my glory, and examples for posterity! And  thou, venerable sage, wise enchanter, whatever be thy name; thou whom  fate has ordained to be the compiler of this rare history, forget not,  I beseech thee, my trusty Rozinante, the eternal companion of all my  adventures.\" After this, as if he had been really in love; \"O Princess  Dulcinea,\" cried he, \"lady of this captive heart, much sorrow and woe  you have doomed me to in banishing me thus, and imposing on me your  rigorous commands, never to appear before your beauteous face!  Remember, lady, that loyal heart your slave, who for your love submits  to so many miseries.\" To these extravagant conceits, he added a world  of others, all in imitation, and in the very style of those which the  reading of romances had furnished him with; and all this while he rode  so softly, and the sun's heat increased so fast, and was so violent,  that it would have been sufficient to have melted his brains, had he  had any left.    He travelled almost all that day without meeting any adventure worth  the trouble of relating, which put him into a kind of despair; for he  desired nothing more than to encounter immediately some person on whom  he might try the vigour of his arm.    Towards the evening, he and his horse being heartily tired and almost  famished, Don Quixote looked about him, in hopes to discover some  castle, or at least some shepherd's cottage, there to repose and  refresh himself; and at last near the road which he kept, he espied an  inn, a most welcome sight to his longing eyes. Hastening towards it  with all the speed he could, he got thither just at the close of the  evening. There stood by chance at the inn-door two young female  adventurers, who were going to Seville with some carriers that  happened to take up their lodging there that very evening; and as  whatever our knight-errant saw, thought, or imagined, was all of a  romantic cast, and appeared to him altogether after the manner of his  favourite books, he no sooner saw the inn but he fancied it to be a  castle fenced with four towers, and lofty pinnacles glittering with  silver, together with a deep moat, drawbridge, and all those other  appurtenances peculiar to such kind of places.    When he came near it, he stopped a while at a distance from the gate,  expecting that some dwarf would appear on the battlements, and sound  his trumpet to give notice of the arrival of a knight; but finding  that nobody came, and that Rozinante was for making the best of his  way to the stable, he advanced to the door, at which the innkeeper  immediately appeared. He was a man whose burden of fat inclined him to  peace and quietness, yet when he observed such a strange disguise of  human shape in his old armour and equipage, he could hardly forbear  laughter; but having the fear of such a warlike appearance before his  eyes, he resolved to give him good words, and therefore accosted him  civilly: \"Sir Knight,\" said he, \"if your worship be disposed to  alight, you will fail of nothing here but of a bed; as for all other  accommodations, you may be supplied to your mind.\" Don Quixote  observing the humility of the governor of the castle (for such the  innkeeper and inn seemed to him), \"Senior Castellano,\" said he, \"the  least thing in the world suffices me; for arms are the only things I  value, and combat is my bed of repose.\" \"At this rate, Sir Knight, you  may safely alight, and I dare assure you, you can hardly miss being  kept awake all the year long in this house, much less one single  night.\" With that he went and held Don Quixote's stirrup, who having  ate nothing all that day, dismounted with no small trouble and  difficulty. He immediately desired the governor (that is, the  innkeeper) to have special care of his steed, assuring him that there  was not a better in the universe; upon which the innkeeper viewed him  narrowly, but could not think him to be half so good as Don Quixote  said. However, having set him up in the stable, he came back to the  knight to see what he wanted, and whether he would eat anything. \"That  I will, with all my heart,\" cried Don Quixote, \"whatever it be; for I  am of opinion nothing can come to me more seasonably.\" Now, it  happened to be Friday, and there was nothing to be had at the inn but  some pieces of fish, which they call _truchuela_; so they asked him  whether he could eat any of that truchuela, because they had no other  fish to give him. Don Quixote imagining they meant small trout, told  them, that provided there were more than one, it was the same thing to  him, they would serve him as well as a great one; \"for,\" continued he,  \"it is all one to me whether I am paid a piece of eight in one single  piece, or in eight small reals, which are worth as much. Besides, it  is probable these small trouts may be like"]]]
