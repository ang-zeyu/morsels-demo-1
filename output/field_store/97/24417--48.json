And so a tragic  and irrevocable miscarriage of justice was happily averted.    Peace liked attending trials. The fact that in Habron's case he was the  real murderer would seem to have made him the more eager not to miss so  unique an experience. Accordingly he went from Hull to Manchester,  and was present in court during the two days that the trial lasted. No  sooner had he heard the innocent man condemned to death than he left  Manchester for Sheffield--now for all he knew a double murderer.    It is a question whether, on the night of November 28, Peace met Mrs.  Dyson at an inn in one of the suburbs of Sheffield. In any case, the  next morning, Wednesday, the 29th, to his mother's surprise Peace walked  into her house. He said that he had come to Sheffield for the fair.  The afternoon of that day Peace spent in a public-house at Ecclesall,  entertaining the customers by playing tunes on a poker suspended from  a piece of strong string, from which he made music by beating it with  a short stick. The musician was rewarded by drinks. It took very little  drink to excite Peace. There was dancing, the fun grew fast and furious,  as the strange musician beat out tune after tune on his fantastic  instrument.    At six o'clock the same evening a thin, grey-haired,  insignificant-looking man in an evident state of unusual excitement  called to see the Rev. Mr. Newman, Vicar of Ecclesall, near Banner  Cross. Some five weeks before, this insignificant-looking man had  visited Mr. Newman, and made certain statements in regard to the  character of a Mr. and Mrs. Dyson who had come to live in the parish.  The vicar had asked for proof of these statements. These proofs his  visitor now produced. They consisted of a number of calling cards and  photographs, some of them alleged to be in the handwriting of Mrs.  Dyson, and showing her intimacy with Peace. The man made what purported  to be a confession to Mr. Newman. Dyson, he said, had become jealous of  him, whereupon Peace had suggested to Mrs. Dyson that they should give  her husband something to be jealous about. Out of this proposal their  intimacy had sprung. Peace spoke of Mrs. Dyson in terms of forgiveness,  but his wrath against Dyson was extreme. He complained bitterly that  by taking proceedings against him, Dyson had driven him to break up his  home and become a fugitive in the land. He should follow the Dysons, he  said, wherever they might go; he believed that they were at that moment  intending to take further proceedings against him. As he left, Peace  said that he should not go and see the Dysons that night, but would call  on a friend of his, Gregory, who lived next door to them in Banner Cross  Terrace. It was now about a quarter to seven.    Peace went to Gregory's house, but his friend was not at home. The lure  of the Dysons was irresistible. A little after eight o'clock Peace was  watching the house from a passageway that led up to the backs of the  houses on the terrace. He saw Mrs. Dyson come out of the back door,  and go to an outhouse some few yards distant. He waited. As soon as  she opened the door to come out, Mrs. Dyson found herself confronted  by Peace, holding his revolver in his hand. \"Speak,\" he said, \"or I'll  fire.\" Mrs. Dyson in terror went back. In the meantime Dyson, hearing  the disturbance, came quickly into the yard. Peace made for the passage.  Dyson followed him. Peace fired once, the shot striking the lintel  of the passage doorway. Dyson undaunted, still pursued. Then Peace,  according to his custom, fired a second time, and Dyson fell, shot  through the temple. Mrs. Dyson, who had come into the yard again on  hearing the first shot, rushed to her husband's side, calling out:  \"Murder! You villain! You have shot my husband.\" Two hours later Dyson  was dead.    After firing the second shot Peace had hurried down; the passage into  the roadway. He stood there hesitating a moment, until the cries of Mrs.  Dyson warned him of his danger. He crossed the road, climbed a wall,  and made his way back to Sheffield. There he saw his mother and brother,  told them that he had shot Mr. Dyson, and bade them a hasty good-bye.  He then walked to Attercliffe Railway Station, and took a ticket for  Beverley. Something suspicious in the manner of the booking-clerk made  him change his place of destination. Instead of going to Beverley that  night he got out of the train at Normanton and went on to York. He spent  the remainder of the night in the station yard. He took the first train  in the morning for Beverley, and from there travelled via Collingham  to Hull. He went straight to the eating-house kept by his wife, and  demanded some dinner. He had hardly commenced to eat it when he heard  two detectives come into the front shop and ask his wife if a man called  Charles Peace was lodging with her. Mrs. Peace said that that was  her husband's name, but that she had not seen him for two months. The  detectives proposed to search the house. Some customers in the shop told  them that if they had any business with Mrs. Peace, they ought to go  round to the side door. The polite susceptibility of these customers  gave Peace time to slip up to a back room, get out on to an adjoining  roof, and hide behind a chimney stack, where he remained until the  detectives had finished an exhaustive search. So importunate were the  officers in Hull that once again during the day Peace had to repeat this  experience. For some three weeks, however, he contrived to remain in  Hull. He shaved the grey beard he was wearing at the time of Dyson's  murder, dyed his hair, put on a pair of spectacles, and for the first  time made use of his singular power of contorting his features in such  a way as to change altogether the character of his face. But the hue and  cry after him was unremitting. There was a price of L100 on his head,  and the following description of him was circulated by the police:      \"Charles Peace wanted for murder on the night of the 29th inst. He is  thin and slightly built, from fifty-five to sixty years of age. Five  feet four inches or five feet high; grey (nearly white) hair, beard and  whiskers. He lacks use of three fingers of left hand, walks with his  legs rather wide apart, speaks somewhat peculiarly as though his  tongue were too large for his mouth, and is a great boaster. He is  a picture-frame maker. He occasionally cleans and repairs clocks and  watches and sometimes deals in oleographs, engravings and pictures. He  has been in penal servitude for burglary in Manchester. He has lived in  Manchester, Salford, and Liverpool and Hull.\"      This description was altered later and Peace's age given as forty-six.  As a matter of fact he was only forty-four at this time, but he looked  very much older. Peace had lost one of his fingers. He said that it had  been shot off by a man with whom he had quarrelled, but it was believed  to be more likely that he had himself shot it off accidentally in  handling one of his revolvers. It was to conceal this obvious means of  identification that Peace made himself the false arm which he was in the  habit of wearing. This was of gutta percha, with a hole down the middle  of it into which he passed his arm; at the end was a steel plate to  which was fixed a hook; by means of this hook Peace could wield a fork  and do other dexterous feats.    Marked man as he was, Peace felt it dangerous to stay longer in Hull  than he could help. During the closing days of the year 1876 and the  beginning of 1877, Peace was perpetually on the move. He left Hull for  Doncaster, and from there travelled to London. On arriving at King's  Cross he took the underground railway to Paddington, and from there a  train to Bristol. At the beginning of January he left Bristol for Bath,  and from Bath, in the company of a sergeant of police, travelled by  way of Didcot to Oxford. The officer had in his custody a young woman  charged with stealing L40. Peace and the sergeant discussed the case  during the journey. \"He seemed a smart chap,\" said Peace in relating  the circumstances, \"but not smart enough to know me.\" From Oxford he  went to Birmingham, where he stayed four or five days, then a week in  Derby, and on January 9th he arrived in Nottingham.    Here Peace found a convenient lodging at the house of one, Mrs. Adamson,  a lady who received stolen goods and on occasion indicated or organised  suitable opportunities for acquiring them.    She lived in a low part of the town known as the Marsh. It was at  her house that Peace met the woman who was to become his mistress and  subsequently betray his identity to the police. Her maiden name was  Susan Gray.    She was at this time about thirty-five years of age, described as  \"taking\" in appearance, of a fair complexion, and rather well educated.  She had led a somewhat chequered married life with a gentleman named  Bailey, from whom she continued in receipt of a weekly allowance until  she passed under the protection of Peace. Her first meeting with her  future lover took place on the occasion of Peace inviting Mrs. Adamson  to dispose of a box of cigars for him, which that good woman did at a  charge of something like thirty per cent. At first Peace gave himself  out to Mrs. Bailey as a hawker, but before long he openly acknowledged  his real character as an accomplished burglar. With characteristic  insistence Peace declared his passion for Mrs. Bailey by threatening  to shoot her if she did not become his. Anxious friends sent for her to  soothe the distracted man. Peace had been drowning care with the help  of Irish whiskey. He asked \"his pet\" if she were not glad to see him, to  which the lady replied with possible sarcasm: \"Oh, particularly, very,  I like you so much.\" Next day Peace apologised for his rude behaviour  of the previous evening, and so melted the heart "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#8)"],[1,"ands, and  banks intended to lend the buyers the necessary purchase-money  were created.  The sums lent were to be repaid by small annuities  deducted from the product of the sale of the crops.    Assured of the neutrality of the peasants, the government could  contend with the fanatics who were burning the towns, throwing  bombs among the crowds, and waging a merciless warfare.  All  those who could be taken were killed.  Such extermination is the  only method discovered since the beginning of the world by which  a society can be protected against the rebels who wish to destroy  it.    The victorious government understood moreover the necessity of  satisfying the legitimate claims of the enlightened portion of  the nation.  It created a parliament instructed to prepare laws  and control expenditure.    The history of the Russian Revolution shows us how a government,  all of whose natural supports have crumbled in succession, can,  with wisdom and firmness, triumph over the most formidable  obstacles.  It has been very justly said that governments are not  overthrown, but that they commit suicide.      3.  Revolutions effected by Governments.--Examples:  China, Turkey, &c.      Governments almost invariably fight revolutions; they hardly ever  create them.  Representing the needs of the moment and general  opinion, they follow the reformers timidly; they do not precede  them.  Sometimes, however, certain governments have attempted  those sudden reforms which we know as revolutions.  The stability  or instability of the national mind decrees the success or  failure of such attempts.    They succeed when the people on whom the government seeks to  impose new institutions is composed of semi-barbarous tribes,  without fixed laws, without solid traditions; that is to say,  without a settled national mind.  Such was the condition of  Russia in the days of Peter the Great.  We know how he sought to  Europeanise the semi-Asiatic populations by means of force.    Japan is another example of a revolution effected by a  government, but it was her machinery, not her mind that was  reformed.    It needs a very powerful autocrat, seconded by a man of genius,  to succeed, even partially, in such a task.  More often than not  the reformer finds that the whole people rises up against him.  Then, to the contrary of what befalls in an ordinary revolution,  the autocrat is revolutionary and the people is conservative.  But an attentive study will soon show you that the peoples are  always extremely conservative.    Failure is the rule with these attempts.  Whether effected by the  upper classes or the lower, revolutions do not change the souls  of peoples that have been a long time established.  They only  change those things that are worn by time and ready to fall.    China is at the present time making a very interesting but  impossible experiment, in seeking, by means of the government,  suddenly to renew the institutions of the country.  The  revolution which overturned the dynasty of her ancient sovereigns  was the indirect consequence of the discontent provoked by  reforms which the government had sought to impose with a view to  ameliorating the condition of China.  The suppression of opium  and gaming, the reform of the army, and the creation of schools,  involved an increase of taxation which, as well as the reforms  themselves, greatly indisposed the general opinion.    A few cultured Chinese educated in the schools of Europe profited  by this discontent to raise the people and proclaim a republic,  an institution of which the Chinese could have had no conception.    It surely cannot long survive, for the impulse which has given  birth to it is not a movement of progress, but of reaction.  The  word republic, to the Chinaman intellectualised by his European  education, is simply synonymous with the rejection of the yoke of  laws, rules, and long-established restraints.  Cutting off his  pigtail, covering his head with a cap, and calling himself a  Republican, the young Chinaman thinks to give the rein to all his  instincts.  This is more or less the idea of a republic that a  large part of the French people entertained at the time of the  great Revolution.    China will soon discover the fate that awaits a society deprived  of the armour slowly wrought by the past.  After a few years of  bloody anarchy it will be necessary to establish a power whose  tyranny will inevitably be far severer than that which was  overthrown.  Science has not yet discovered the magic ring  capable of saving a society without discipline.  There is no need  to impose discipline when it has become hereditary, but when the  primitive instincts have been allowed to destroy the barriers  painfully erected by slow ancestral labours, they cannot be  reconstituted save by an energetic tyranny.    As a proof of these assertions we may instance an experiment  analogous to that undertaken by China; that recently attempted by  Turkey.  A few years ago young men instructed in European schools  and full of good intentions succeeded, with the aid of a  number of officers, in overthrowing a Sultan whose tyranny seemed  insupportable.  Having acquired our robust Latin faith in the  magic power of formulae, they thought they could establish the  representative system in a country half-civilised, profoundly  divided by religious hatred, and peopled by divers races.    The attempt has not prospered hitherto.  The authors of the  reformation had to learn that despite their liberalism they were  forced to govern by methods very like those employed by the  government overthrown.  They could neither prevent summary  executions nor wholesale massacres of Christians, nor could they  remedy a single abuse.    It would be unjust to reproach them.  What in truth could they  have done to change a people whose traditions have been fixed so  long, whose religious passions are so intense, and whose  Mohammedans, although in the minority, legitimately claim to  govern the sacred city of their faith according to their code?  How prevent Islam from remaining the State religion in a country  where civil law and religious law are not yet plainly separated,  and where faith in the Koran is the only tie by which the idea of  nationality can be maintained?    It was difficult to destroy such a state of affairs, so that we  were bound to see the re-establishment of an autocratic  organisation with an appearance of constitutionalism--that is to  say, practically the old system once again.  Such attempts afford  a good example of the fact that a people cannot choose its  institutions until it has transformed its mind.      4.  Social elements which survive the changes of Government after  Revolution.      What we shall say later on as to the stable foundation of the  national soul will enable us to appreciate the force of systems  of government that have been long established, such as ancient  monarchies.  A monarch may easily be overthrown by conspirators,  but these latter are powerless against the principles which the  monarch represents.  Napoleon at his fall was replaced not by his  natural heir, but by the heir of kings.  The latter incarnated an  ancient principle, while the son of the Emperor personified ideas  that were as yet imperfectly established in men's minds.    For the same reason a minister, however able, however great the  services he has rendered to his country, can very rarely  overthrow his Sovereign.  Bismarck himself could not have done  so.  This great minister had single-handed created the unity of  Germany, yet his master had only to touch him with his finger and  he vanished.  A man is as nothing before a principle supported by  opinion.    But even when, for various reasons, the principle incarnated by a  government is annihilated with that government, as happened at  the time of the French Revolution, all the elements of social  organisation do not perish at the same time.    If we knew nothing of France but the disturbances of the last  hundred years and more we might suppose the country to live in a  state of profound anarchy.  Now her economic, industrial, and  even her political life manifests, on the contrary, a continuity  that seems to be independent of all revolutions and governments.    The fact is that beside the great events of which history treats  are the little facts of daily life which the books neglect to  tell.  They are ruled by imperious necessities which halt for no  man.  Their total mass forms the real framework of the life of  the people.    While the study of great events shows us that the nominal  government of France has been frequently changed in the space of  a century, an examination of the little daily events will prove,  on the contrary, that her real government has been little  altered.    Who in truth are the real rulers of a people?  Kings and  ministers, no doubt, in the great crises of national life, but  they play no part whatever in the little realities which make up  the life of every day.  The real directing forces of a country  are the administrations, composed of impersonal elements which  are never affected by the changes of government.  Conservative of  traditions, they are anonymous and lasting, and constitute an  occult power before which all others must eventually bow.  Their  action has even increased to such a degree that, as we shall  presently show, there is a danger that they may form an anonymous  State more powerful than the official State.  France has thus  come to be governed by heads of departments and government  clerks.  The more we study the history of revolutions the more we  discover that they change practically nothing but the label.  To  create a revolution is easy, but to change the soul of a people  is difficult indeed.        CHAPTER IV    THE PART PLAYED BY THE PEOPLE IN REVOLUTIONS    1.
