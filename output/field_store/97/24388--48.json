A voice answered from within: \"Tell him I cannot see any one,\" it  said complainingly.    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Poole, with a note of something like  triumph in his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr.  Utterson back across the yard and into the great kitchen, where  the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floor.    \"Sir,\" he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, \"was that my  master's voice?\"    \"It seems much changed,\" replied the lawyer, very pale, but  giving look for look.    \"Changed? Well, yes, I think so,\" said the butler. \"Have I been  twenty years in this man's house, to be deceived about his voice?  No, sir; master's made away with; he was made, away with eight  days ago, when we heard him cry out upon the name of God; and  who's in there instead of him, and why it stays there, is a thing  that cries to Heaven, Mr. Utterson!\"    56)    \"This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale,  my man,\" said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. \"Suppose it were  as you suppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been--well,  murdered, what could induce the murderer to stay? That won't hold  water; it doesn't commend itself to reason.\"    \"Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I'll do  it yet,\" said Poole. \"All this last week (you must know) him, or  it, or whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying  night and day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his  mind. It was sometimes his way--the master's, that is--to  write his orders on a sheet of paper and throw it on the stair.  We've had nothing else this week back; nothing but papers, and a  closed door, and the very meals left there to be smuggled in when  nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice and  thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints,  and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in  town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another  paper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and  another order to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter  bad, sir, whatever for.\"    \"Have you any of these papers?\" asked Mr. Utterson.    Poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which  the lawyer, bending nearer    57)    to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents ran thus: \"Dr.  Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He assures them  that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his  present purpose. In the year 18---, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat  large quantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with  the most sedulous care, and should any of the same quality be  left, to forward it to him at once. Expense is no consideration.  The importance of this to Dr. J. can hardly be exaggerated.\" So  far the letter had run composedly enough, but here with a sudden  splutter of the pen, the writer's emotion had broken loose. \"For  God's sake,\" he had added, \"find me some of the old.\"    \"This is a strange note,\" said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply,  \"How do you come to have it open?\"    \"The man at Maw's was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me  like so much dirt,\" returned Poole.    \"This is unquestionably the doctor's hand, do you know?\" resumed  the lawyer.    \"I thought it looked like it,\" said the servant rather sulkily;  and then, with another voice, \"But what matters hand-of-write?\"  he said. \"I've seen him!\"    \"Seen him?\" repeated Mr. Utterson. \"Well?\"    \"That's it!\" said Poole. \"It was this way. I came suddenly into  the theatre from the    58)    garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this drug or  whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was  at the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up  when I came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped up-stairs into  the cabinet. It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the  hair stood upon my head like quills. Sir, if that was my master,  why had he a mask upon his face? If it was my master, why did he  cry out like a rat, and run from me? I have served him long  enough. And then...\" The man paused and passed his hand over his  face.    \"These are all very strange circumstances,\" said Mr. Utterson,  \"but I think I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is  plainly seized with one of those maladies that both torture and  deform the sufferer; hence, for aught I know, the alteration of  his voice; hence the mask and the avoidance of his friends; hence  his eagerness to find this drug, by means of which the poor soul  retains some hope of ultimate recovery--God grant that he be  not deceived! There is my explanation; it is sad enough, Poole,  ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain and natural, hangs  well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant alarms.\"    \"Sir,\" said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor,  \"that thing was not my master, and there's the truth. My master\"  here he looked round him and began to whisper--\"is    59)    a tall, fine build of a man, and this was more of a dwarf.\"  Utterson attempted to protest. \"O, sir,\" cried Poole, \"do you  think I do not know my master after twenty years? Do you think I  do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door, where I  saw him every morning of my life? No, Sir, that thing in the mask  was never Dr. Jekyll--God knows what it was, but it was never  Dr. Jekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was  murder done.\"    \"Poole,\" replied the lawyer, \"if you say that, it will become my  duty to make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master's  feelings, much as I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove  him to be still alive, I shall consider it my duty to break in  that door.\"    \"Ah Mr. Utterson, that's talking!\" cried the butler.    \"And now comes the second question,\" resumed Utterson: \"Who is  going to do it?\"    \"Why, you and me,\" was the undaunted reply.    \"That's very well said,\" returned the lawyer; \"and whatever comes  of it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.\"    \"There is an axe in the theatre,\" continued Poole; \"and you might  take the kitchen poker for yourself.\"    The lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand,  and balanced it. \"Do you know, Poole,\" he said, looking up, \"that    60)    you and I are about to place ourselves in a position of some  peril?\"    \"You may say so, sir, indeed,\" returned the butler.    \"It is well, then, that we should be frank,\" said the other. \"We  both think more than we have said; let us make a clean breast.  This masked figure that you saw, did you recognise it?\"    \"Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up,  that I could hardly swear to that,\" was the answer. \"But if you  mean, was it Mr. Hyde?--why, yes, I think it was! You see, it  was much of the same bigness; and it had the same quick, light  way with it; and then who else could have got in by the  laboratory door? You have not forgot, sir that at the time of the  murder he had still the key with him? But that's not all. I don't  know, Mr. Utterson, if ever you met this Mr. Hyde?\"    \"Yes,\" said the lawyer, \"I once spoke with him.\"    \"Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was  something queer about that gentleman--something that gave a man  a turn--I don't know rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this:  that you felt it in your marrow kind of cold and thin.\"    \"I own I felt something of what you describe,\" said Mr. Utterson.    \"Quite so, sir,\" returned Poole. \"Well, when    61)    that masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicals  and whipped into the cabinet, it went down my spine like ice. Oh,  I know it's not evidence, Mr. Utterson. I'm book-learned enough  for that; but a man has his feelings, and I give you my  Bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!\"    \"Ay, ay,\" said the lawyer. \"My fears incline to the same point.  Evil, I fear, founded--evil was sure to come--of that  connection. Ay, truly, I believe you; I believe poor Harry is  killed; and I believe his murderer (for what purpose, God alone  can tell) is still lurking in his victim's room. Well, let our  name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.\"    The footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.      \"Pull yourself together, Bradshaw,\" said the lawyer. \"This  suspense, I know, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our  intention to make an end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to  force our way into the cabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are  broad enough to bear the blame. Meanwhile, lest anything should  really be amiss, or any malefactor seek to escape by the back,  you and the boy must go round the corner with a pair of good  sticks and take your post at the laboratory door. We give you ten  minutes to get to your stations.\"    As Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. \"And now,  Poole, let us get to ours,\"    62)    he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the way into the  yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now quite  dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that  deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro  about their steps, until they came into the shelter of the  theatre, where they sat down silently to wait. London hummed  solemnly all around; but nearer at hand, the stillness was only  broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the  cabinet floor.    \"So it will walk all day, sir,\" whispered Poole; \"ay, and the  better part of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the  chemist, there's a bit of a break. Ah, it's an ill conscience  that's such an enemy to rest! Ah, sir, there's blood foully shed  in every step of it! But hark again, a little closer--put your  heart in your ears, Mr. Utterson, and tell me, is that the  doctor's foot?\"    The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all  they went so slowly; it was different indeed from "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#8)"],[1,"others or  not.\"    At this the Wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick of  producing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again.  He  did it very cleverly, indeed, and the Princess looked at the strange  piglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person  could be.  But afterward she said:    \"I have heard of this wonderful magic.  But it accomplishes nothing of  value.  What else can you do?\"    The Wizard tried to think.  Then he jointed together the blades of his  sword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose.  But  even that did not satisfy the Princess.    Just then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oil  which Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon, and he got a clever  idea from those commonplace things.    \"Your Highness,\" said he, \"I will now proceed to prove my magic by  creating two suns that you have never seen before; also I will exhibit  a Destroyer much more dreadful that your Clinging Vines.\"    So he placed Dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other  and set a lantern upon each of their heads.    \"Don't laugh,\" he whispered to them, \"or you will spoil the effect of  my magic.\"    Then, with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his wrinkled  face, the Wizard got out his match-box and lighted the two lanterns.  The glare they made was very small when compared with the radiance of  the six great colored suns; but still they gleamed steadily and  clearly.  The Mangaboos were much impressed because they had never  before seen any light that did not come directly from their suns.    Next the Wizard poured a pool of oil from the can upon the glass floor,  where it covered quite a broad surface.  When he lighted the oil a  hundred tongues of flame shot up, and the effect was really imposing.    \"Now, Princess,\" exclaimed the Wizard, \"those of your advisors who  wished to throw us into the Garden of Clinging Vines must step within  this circle of light.  If they advised you well, and were in the right,  they will not be injured in any way.  But if any advised you wrongly,  the light will wither him.\"    The advisors of the Princess did not like this test; but she commanded  them to step into the flame and one by one they did so, and were  scorched so badly that the air was soon filled with an odor like that  of baked potatoes.  Some of the Mangaboos fell down and had to be  dragged from the fire, and all were so withered that it would be  necessary to plant them at once.    \"Sir,\" said the Princess to the Wizard, \"you are greater than any  Sorcerer we have ever known.  As it is evident that my people have  advised me wrongly, I will not cast you three people into the dreadful  Garden of the Clinging Vines; but your animals must be driven into the  Black Pit in the mountain, for my subjects cannot bear to have them  around.\"    The Wizard was so pleased to have saved the two children and himself  that he said nothing against this decree; but when the Princess had  gone both Jim and Eureka protested they did not want to go to the Black  Pit, and Dorothy promised she would do all that she could to save them  from such a fate.    For two or three days after this--if we call days the periods between  sleep, there being no night to divide the hours into days--our friends  were not disturbed in any way.  They were even permitted to occupy the  House of the Sorcerer in peace, as if it had been their own, and to  wander in the gardens in search of food.    Once they came near to the enclosed Garden of the Clinging Vines, and  walking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest.  They  saw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing and  twisting around like a nest of great snakes.  Everything the vines  touched they crushed, and our adventurers were indeed thankful to have  escaped being cast among them.    Whenever the Wizard went to sleep he would take the nine tiny piglets  from his pocket and let them run around on the floor of his room to  amuse themselves and get some exercise; and one time they found his  glass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom  part of the great dome, walking through the air as easily as Eureka  could.  They knew the kitten, by this time, so they scampered over to  where she lay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her.    The cab-horse, who never slept long at a time, sat upon his haunches  and watched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval.    \"Don't be rough!\" he would call out, if Eureka knocked over one of the  round, fat piglets with her paw; but the pigs never minded, and enjoyed  the sport very greatly.    Suddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent,  solemn-eyed Mangaboos.  Each of the vegetable folks bore a branch  covered with sharp thorns, which was thrust defiantly toward the horse,  the kitten and the piglets.    \"Here--stop this foolishness!\" Jim roared, angrily; but after being  pricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the way  of the thorns.    The Mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks, but left an opening to  the doorway of the hall; so the animals slowly retreated until they  were driven from the room and out upon the street.  Here were more of  the vegetable people with thorns, and silently they urged the now  frightened creatures down the street.  Jim had to be careful not to  step upon the tiny piglets, who scampered under his feet grunting and  squealing, while Eureka, snarling and biting at the thorns pushed  toward her, also tried to protect the pretty little things from injury.  Slowly but steadily the heartless Mangaboos drove them on, until they  had passed through the city and the gardens and come to the broad  plains leading to the mountain.    \"What does all this mean, anyhow?\" asked the horse, jumping to escape a  thorn.    \"Why, they are driving us toward the Black Pit, into which they  threatened to cast us,\" replied the kitten.  \"If I were as big as you  are, Jim, I'd fight these miserable turnip-roots!\"    \"What would you do?\" enquired Jim.    \"I'd kick out with those long legs and iron-shod hoofs.\"    \"All right,\" said the horse; \"I'll do it.\"    An instant later he suddenly backed toward the crowd of Mangaboos and  kicked out his hind legs as hard as he could.  A dozen of them smashed  together and tumbled to the ground, and seeing his success Jim kicked  again and again, charging into the vegetable crowd, knocking them in  all directions and sending the others scattering to escape his iron  heels.  Eureka helped him by flying into the faces of the enemy and  scratching and biting furiously, and the kitten ruined so many  vegetable complexions that the Mangaboos feared her as much as they did  the horse.    But the foes were too many to be repulsed for long.  They tired Jim and  Eureka out, and although the field of battle was thickly covered with  mashed and disabled Mangaboos, our animal friends had to give up at  last and allow themselves to be driven to the mountain.          7.  Into the Black Pit and Out Again      When they came to the mountain it proved to be a rugged, towering chunk  of deep green glass, and looked dismal and forbidding in the extreme.  Half way up the steep was a yawning cave, black as night beyond the  point where the rainbow rays of the colored suns reached into it.    The Mangaboos drove the horse and the kitten and the piglets into this  dark hole and then, having pushed the buggy in after them--for it  seemed some of them had dragged it all the way from the domed  hall--they began to pile big glass rocks within the entrance, so that  the prisoners could not get out again.    \"This is dreadful!\" groaned Jim.  \"It will be about the end of our  adventures, I guess.\"    \"If the Wizard was here,\" said one of the piglets, sobbing bitterly,  \"he would not see us suffer so.\"    \"We ought to have called him and Dorothy when we were first attacked,\"  added Eureka.  \"But never mind; be brave, my friends, and I will go and  tell our masters where you are, and get them to come to your rescue.\"    The mouth of the hole was nearly filled up now, but the kitten gave a  leap through the remaining opening and at once scampered up into the  air.  The Mangaboos saw her escape, and several of them caught up their  thorns and gave chase, mounting through the air after her.  Eureka,  however, was lighter than the Mangaboos, and while they could mount  only about a hundred feet above the earth the kitten found she could go  nearly two hundred feet.  So she ran along over their heads until she  had left them far behind and below and had come to the city and the  House of the Sorcerer.  There she entered in at Dorothy's window in the  dome and aroused her from her sleep.    As soon as the little girl knew what had happened she awakened the  Wizard and Zeb, and at once preparations were made to go to the rescue  of Jim and the piglets.  The Wizard carried his satchel, which was  quite heavy, and Zeb carried the two lanterns and the oil can.  Dorothy's wicker suit-case was still under the seat of the buggy, and  by good fortune the boy had also placed the harness in the buggy when  he had taken it off from Jim to let the horse lie down and rest.  So  there was nothing for the girl to carry but the kitten, which she held  close to her bosom and tried to comfort, for its little heart was still  beating rapidly.    Some of the Mangaboos discovered them as soon as they left the House of  the Sorcerer; but when they started toward the mountain the vegetable  people allowed them to proceed without interference, yet followed in a  crowd behind them so that they could not go back again.    Before long they neared the Black Pit, where a busy swarm of Mangaboos,  headed by their Princess, was engaged in piling up glass rocks before  the entrance.    \"Stop, I command you!\" cried the Wizard, in an angry tone, and at once "]]]
