I can see it a little when I      make the Yoorish sign or blow the power of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it      is near like them at May Eve on the Hill. The other face may wear      off some. I wonder how I shall look when the earth is cleared and      there are no earth beings on it. He that came with the Aklo Sabaoth      said I may be transfigured, there being much of outside to work on.    Morning found Dr. Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of  wakeful concentration. He had not left the manuscript all night, but  sat at his table under the electric light turning page after page  with shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text. He  had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home, and when she  brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a  mouthful. All that day he read on, now and then halted maddeningly as  a reapplication of the complex key became necessary. Lunch and dinner  were brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either.  Toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but  soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths  and menaces to man's existence that he had uncovered.    On the morning of September fourth Professor Rice and Dr. Morgan  insisted on seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and  ashen-gray. That evening he went to bed, but slept only fitfully.  Wednesday--the next day--he was back at the manuscript, and began to  take copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had  already deciphered. In the small hours of that night he slept a little  in an easy-chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before  dawn. Some time before noon his physician, Dr. Hartwell, called to see  him and insisted that he cease work. He refused, intimating that it was  of the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the  diary, and promising an explanation in due course of time.    That evening, just as twilight fell, he finished his terrible perusal  and sank back exhausted. His wife, bringing his dinner, found him in a  half-comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with  a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken.  Weakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all  in a great envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside coat  pocket. He had sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in  need of medical aid that Dr. Hartwell was summoned at once. As the  doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again, \"_But  what, in God's name, can we do?_\"    Dr. Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made  no explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the  imperative need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan. His wilder  wanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals  that something in a boarded-up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic  references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race  and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder  race of beings from another dimension. He would shout that the world  was in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it  away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane  or phase of entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of eons  ago. At other times he would call for the dreaded _Necronomicon_ and  the _Dæmonolatreia_ of Remigius, in which he seemed hopeful of finding  some formula to check the peril he conjured up.    \"Stop them, stop them!\" he would shout. \"Those Whateleys meant to let  them in, and the worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do  something--it's a blind business, but I know how to make the powder....  It hasn't been fed since the second of August, when Wilbur came here to  his death, and at that rate....\"    But Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and  slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever. He  woke late Friday, clear of head, though sober, with a gnawing fear and  tremendous sense of responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to  go over to the library and summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and  the rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains  in the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate. Strange and  terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from  secure places of storage, and diagrams and formulæ were copied with  feverish haste and in bewildering abundance. Of skepticism there was  none. All three had seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the  floor in a room of that very building, and after that not one of them  could feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman's  raving.    Opinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police,  and the negative finally won. There were things involved which simply  could not be believed by those who had not seen a sample, as indeed was  made clear during certain subsequent investigations. Late at night the  conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan, but all  day Sunday Armitage was busy comparing formulæ and mixing chemicals  obtained from the college laboratory. The more he reflected on the  hellish diary, the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any  material agent in stamping out the entity which Wilbur Whateley had  left behind him--the earth-threatening entity which, unknown to him,  was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable Dunwich  horror.    Monday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr. Armitage, for the task  in hand required an infinity of research and experiment. Further  consultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of  plan, and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty  must remain. By Tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out,  and believed he would try a trip to Dunwich within a week. Then, on  Wednesday, the great shock came. Tucked obscurely away in a corner of  the _Arkham Advertiser_ was a facetious little item from the Associated  Press, telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whisky of  Dunwich had raised up. Armitage, half stunned, could only telephone  for Rice and Morgan. Far into the night they discussed, and the next  day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all. Armitage  knew he would be meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was  no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others  had done before him.      9    Friday morning Armitage, Rice and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich,  arriving at the village about 1 in the afternoon. The day was pleasant,  but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent  seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy  ravines of the stricken region. Now and then on some mountain top a  gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky. From the  air of hushed fright at Osborn's store they knew something hideous  had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye  house and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich,  questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing  for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with  their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks  in the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous  swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places. The trail up and down  Sentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance,  and he looked long at the sinister altarlike stone on the summit.    At length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had  come from Aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone  reports of the Frye tragedy, decided to seek out the officers and  compare notes as far as practicable. This, however, they found more  easily planned than performed; since no sign of the party could be  found in any direction. There had been five of them in a car, but now  the car stood empty near the ruins in the Frye yard. The natives, all  of whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as  Armitage and his companions. Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something  and turned pale, nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep  hollow that yawned close by.    \"Gawd,\" he gasped, \"I telled 'em not ter go daown into the glen, an' I  never thought nobody'd dew it with them tracks an' that smell an' the  whippoorwills a-screechin' daown thar in the dark o' noonday....\"    A cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear  seemed strained in a kind of instinctive, unconscious listening.  Armitage, now that he had actually come upon the horror and its  monstrous work, trembled with the responsibility he felt to be  his. Night would soon fall, and it was then that the mountainous  blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course. _Negotium perambulans in  tenebris...._ The old librarian rehearsed the formulæ he had memorized,  and clutched the paper containing the alternative ones he had not  memorized. He saw that his electric flashlight was in working order.  Rice, beside him, took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used  in combating insects; whilst Morgan uncased the big-game rifle on which  he relied despite his colleague's warnings that no material weapon  would be of help.    Armitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind  of a manifestation to expect, but he did not add to the fright of the  Dunwich people by giving any hints or clues. He hoped that it might  be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous  thing it had escaped. As the shadows gathered, the natives commenced  to disperse homeward, anxious to bar themselves indoors"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/502"],[0,"Desert Gold (#8)"],[1," talking, drinking.  The fact that they wore cartridge  belts crossed over their breasts satisfied that these were the rebels.  He had noted the belts of the Mexicans outside, who were apparently  guards.  A waiter brought more drinks to this group at the table, and  this caused the leader to turn so Gale could see his face.  It was  indeed the sinister, sneering face of the bandit Rojas.  Gale gazed at  the man with curiosity.  He was under medium height, and striking in  appearance only because of his dandified dress and evil visage. He wore  a lace scarf, a tight, bright-buttoned jacket, a buckskin vest  embroidered in red, a sash and belt joined by an enormous silver clasp.  Gale saw again the pearl-handled gun swinging at the bandit's hip.  Jewels flashed in his scarf.  There were gold rings in his ears and  diamonds on his fingers.    Gale became conscious of an inward fire that threatened to overrun his  coolness.  Other emotions harried his self-control.  It seemed as if  sight of the man liberated or created a devil in Gale.  And at the  bottom of his feelings there seemed to be a wonder at himself, a  strange satisfaction for the something that had come to him.    He stepped out of the doorway, down the couple of steps to the floor of  the saloon, and he staggered a little, simulating drunkenness. He fell  over the pool tables, jostled Mexicans at the bar, laughed like a  maudlin fool, and, with his hat slouched down, crowded here and there.  Presently his eye caught sight of the group of cowboys whom he had  before noticed with such interest.    They were still in a corner somewhat isolated.  With fertile mind  working, Gale lurched over to them.  He remembered his many  unsuccessful attempts to get acquainted with cowboys.  If he were to  get any help from these silent aloof rangers it must be by striking  fire from them in one swift stroke.  Planting himself squarely before  the two tall cowboys who were standing, he looked straight into their  lean, bronzed faces.  He spared a full moment for that keen cool gaze  before he spoke.    \"I'm not drunk.  I'm throwing a bluff, and I mean to start a rough  house.  I'm going to rush that damned bandit Rojas.  It's to save a  girl--to give her lover, who is my friend, a chance to escape with her.  When I start a row my friend will try to slip out with her.  Every door  and window is watched.  I've got to raise hell to draw the guards  in.... Well, you're my countrymen.  We're in Mexico.  A beautiful  girl's honor and life are at stake.  Now, gentlemen, watch me!\"    One cowboy's eyes narrowed, blinking a little, and his lean jaw  dropped; the other's hard face rippled with a fleeting smile.    Gale backed away, and his pulse leaped when he saw the two cowboys, as  if with one purpose, slowly stride after him.  Then Gale swerved,  staggering along, brushed against the tables, kicked over the empty  chairs.  He passed Rojas and his gang, and out of the tail of his eye  saw that the bandit was watching him, waving his hands and talking  fiercely.  The hum of the many voices grew louder, and when Dick  lurched against a table, overturning it and spilling glasses into the  laps of several Mexicans, there arose a shrill cry. He had succeeded in  attracting attention; almost every face turned his way.  One of the  insulted men, a little tawny fellow, leaped up to confront Gale, and in  a frenzy screamed a volley of Spanish, of which Gale distinguished  \"Gringo!\"  The Mexican stamped and made a threatening move with his  right hand.  Dick swung his leg and with a swift side kick knocked the  fellows feet from under him, whirling him down with a thud.    The action was performed so suddenly, so adroitly, it made the Mexican  such a weakling, so like a tumbled tenpin, that the shrill jabbering  hushed.  Gale knew this to be the significant moment.    Wheeling, he rushed at Rojas.  It was his old line-breaking plunge.  Neither Rojas nor his men had time to move.  The black-skinned bandit's  face turned a dirty white; his jaw dropped; he would have shrieked if  Gale had not hit him.  The blow swept him backward against his men.  Then Gale's heavy body, swiftly following with the momentum of that  rush, struck the little group of rebels.  They went down with table and  chairs in a sliding crash.    Gale carried by his plunge, went with them.  Like a cat he landed on  top.  As he rose his powerful hands fastened on Rojas.  He jerked the  little bandit off the tangled pile of struggling, yelling men, and,  swinging him with terrific force, let go his hold.  Rojas slid along  the floor, knocking over tables and chairs. Gale bounded back, dragged  Rojas up, handling him as if he were a limp sack.    A shot rang out above the yells.  Gale heard the jingle of breaking  glass.  The room darkened perceptibly.  He flashed a glance backward.  The two cowboys were between him and the crowd of frantic rebels. One  cowboy held two guns low down, level in front of him.  The other had  his gun raised and aimed.  On the instant it spouted red and white.  With the crack came the crashing of glass, another darkening shade over  the room.  With a cry Gale slung the bleeding Rojas from him.  The  bandit struck a table, toppled over it, fell, and lay prone.    Another shot made the room full of moving shadows, with light only back  of the bar.  A white-clad figure rushed at Gale.  He tripped the man,  but had to kick hard to disengage himself from grasping hands.  Another  figure closed in on Gale.  This one was dark, swift. A blade  glinted--described a circle aloft.  Simultaneously with a close, red  flash the knife wavered; the man wielding it stumbled backward.  In the  din Gale did not hear a report, but the Mexican's fall was significant.  Then pandemonium broke loose.  The din became a roar.  Gale heard shots  that sounded like dull spats in the distance.  The big lamp behind the  bar seemingly split, then sputtered and went out, leaving the room in  darkness.    Gale leaped toward the restaurant door, which was outlined faintly by  the yellow light within.  Right and left he pushed the groping men who  jostled with him.  He vaulted a pool table, sent tables and chairs  flying, and gained the door, to be the first of a wedging mob to  squeeze through.  One sweep of his arm knocked the restaurant lamp from  its stand; and he ran out, leaving darkness behind him. A few bounds  took him into the parlor.  It was deserted.  Thorne had gotten away  with Mercedes.    It was then Gale slowed up.  For the space of perhaps sixty seconds he  had been moving with startling velocity.  He peered cautiously out into  the plaza.  The paths, the benches, the shady places under the trees  contained no skulking men.  He ran out, keeping to the shade, and did  not go into the path till he was halfway through the plaza.  Under a  street lamp at the far end of the path he thought he saw two dark  figures.  He ran faster, and soon reached the street. The uproar back  in the hotel began to diminish, or else he was getting out of hearing.  The few people he saw close at hand were all coming his way, and only  the foremost showed any excitement. Gale walked swiftly, peering ahead  for two figures.  Presently he saw them--one tall, wearing a cape; the  other slight, mantled.  Gale drew a sharp breath of relief.  Thorne and  Mercedes were not far ahead.    From time to time Thorne looked back.  He strode swiftly, almost  carrying Mercedes, who clung closely to him.  She, too, looked back.  Once Gale saw her white face flash in the light of a street lamp. He  began to overhaul them; and soon, when the last lamp had been passed  and the street was dark, he ventured a whistle.  Thorne heard it, for  he turned, whistled a low reply, and went on.  Not for some distance  beyond, where the street ended in open country, did they halt to wait.  The desert began here.  Gale felt the soft sand under his feet and saw  the grotesque forms of cactus.  Then he came up with the fugitives.    \"Dick!  Are you--all right?\" panted Thorne, grasping Gale.    \"I'm--out of breath--but--O.K.,\" replied Gale.    \"Good! Good!\" choked Thorne.  \"I was scared--helpless.... Dick, it  worked splendidly.  We had no trouble.  What on earth did you do?\"    \"I made the row, all right,\" said Dick.    \"Good Heavens!  It was like a row I once heard made by a mob.  But the  shots, Dick--were they at you?  They paralyzed me.  Then the yells.  What happened?  Those guards of Rojas ran round in front at the first  shot.  Tell me what happened.\"    \"While I was rushing Rojas a couple of cowboys shot out the lamplights.  A Mexican who pulled a knife on me got hurt, I guess.  Then I think  there was some shooting from the rebels after the room was dark.\"    \"Rushing Rojas?\" queried Thorne, leaning close to Dick.  His voice was  thrilling, exultant, deep with a joy that yet needed confirmation.  \"What did you do to him?\"    \"I handed him one off side, tackled, then tried a forward pass,\"  replied Dick, lightly speaking the football vernacular so familiar to  Thorne.    Thorne leaned closer, his fine face showing fierce and corded in the  starlight.  \"Tell me straight,\" he demanded, in thick voice.    Gale then divined something of the suffering Thorne had  undergone--something of the hot, wild, vengeful passion of a lover who  must have brutal truth.    It stilled Dick's lighter mood, and he was about to reply when Mercedes  pressed close to him, touched his hands, looked up into his face with  wonderful eyes.  He thought he would not soon forget their beauty--the  shadow of pain that had been, the hope dawning so fugitively.    \"Dear lady,\" said Gale, with voice not wholly steady, \"Rojas himself  will hound you no more to-night, nor for many nights.\"    She seemed to shake, to thrill, to rise with the intelligence. She  pressed his hand close over her heaving breast.  Gale felt the quick  throb of her heart.    \"Senor!  Senor Dick!\" she cried.  Then her "]]]
