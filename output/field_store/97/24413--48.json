He took up a black leather case, put on his hat, and they went down the  dark stairs into the street. The summer moon hung full in the sky. For  the time being, it was the great fact in the world. Beyond the edge of  the town the plain was so white that every clump of sage stood out  distinct from the sand, and the dunes looked like a shining lake. The  doctor took off his straw hat and carried it in his hand as they walked  toward Mexican Town, across the sand.    North of Pueblo, Mexican settlements were rare in Colorado then. This  one had come about accidentally. Spanish Johnny was the first Mexican  who came to Moonstone. He was a painter and decorator, and had been  working in Trinidad, when Ray Kennedy told him there was a \"boom\" on in  Moonstone, and a good many new buildings were going up. A year after  Johnny settled in Moonstone, his cousin, Famos Serrenos, came to work in  the brickyard; then Serrenos' cousins came to help him. During the  strike, the master mechanic put a gang of Mexicans to work in the  roundhouse. The Mexicans had arrived so quietly, with their blankets and  musical instruments, that before Moonstone was awake to the fact, there  was a Mexican quarter; a dozen families or more.    As Thea and the doctor approached the 'dobe houses, they heard a guitar,  and a rich barytone voice--that of Famos Serrenos--singing \"La  Golandrina.\" All the Mexican houses had neat little yards, with tamarisk  hedges and flowers, and walks bordered with shells or whitewashed  stones. Johnny's house was dark. His wife, Mrs. Tellamantez, was sitting  on the doorstep, combing her long, blue-black hair. (Mexican women are  like the Spartans; when they are in trouble, in love, under stress of  any kind, they comb and comb their hair.) She rose without embarrassment  or apology, comb in hand, and greeted the doctor.    \"Good-evening; will you go in?\" she asked in a low, musical voice. \"He  is in the back room. I will make a light.\" She followed them indoors,  lit a candle and handed it to the doctor, pointing toward the bedroom.  Then she went back and sat down on her doorstep.    Dr. Archie and Thea went into the bedroom, which was dark and quiet.  There was a bed in the corner, and a man was lying on the clean sheets.  On the table beside him was a glass pitcher, half-full of water. Spanish  Johnny looked younger than his wife, and when he was in health he was  very handsome: slender, gold-colored, with wavy black hair, a round,  smooth throat, white teeth, and burning black eyes. His profile was  strong and severe, like an Indian's. What was termed his \"wildness\"  showed itself only in his feverish eyes and in the color that burned on  his tawny cheeks. That night he was a coppery green, and his eyes were  like black holes. He opened them when the doctor held the candle before  his face.    \"MI TESTA!\" he muttered, \"MI TESTA,\" doctor. \"LA FIEBRE!\" Seeing the  doctor's companion at the foot of the bed, he attempted a smile.  \"MUCHACHA!\" he exclaimed deprecatingly.    Dr. Archie stuck a thermometer into his mouth. \"Now, Thea, you can run  outside and wait for me.\"    Thea slipped noiselessly through the dark house and joined Mrs.  Tellamantez. The somber Mexican woman did not seem inclined to talk, but  her nod was friendly. Thea sat down on the warm sand, her back to the  moon, facing Mrs. Tellamantez on her doorstep, and began to count the  moon flowers on the vine that ran over the house. Mrs. Tellamantez was  always considered a very homely woman. Her face was of a strongly marked  type not sympathetic to Americans. Such long, oval faces, with a full  chin, a large, mobile mouth, a high nose, are not uncommon in Spain.  Mrs. Tellamantez could not write her name, and could read but little.  Her strong nature lived upon itself. She was chiefly known in Moonstone  for her forbearance with her incorrigible husband.    Nobody knew exactly what was the matter with Johnny, and everybody liked  him. His popularity would have been unusual for a white man, for a  Mexican it was unprecedented. His talents were his undoing. He had a  high, uncertain tenor voice, and he played the mandolin with exceptional  skill. Periodically he went crazy. There was no other way to explain his  behavior. He was a clever workman, and, when he worked, as regular and  faithful as a burro. Then some night he would fall in with a crowd at  the saloon and begin to sing. He would go on until he had no voice left,  until he wheezed and rasped. Then he would play his mandolin furiously,  and drink until his eyes sank back into his head. At last, when he was  put out of the saloon at closing time, and could get nobody to listen to  him, he would run away--along the railroad track, straight across the  desert. He always managed to get aboard a freight somewhere. Once beyond  Denver, he played his way southward from saloon to saloon until he got  across the border. He never wrote to his wife; but she would soon begin  to get newspapers from La Junta, Albuquerque, Chihuahua, with marked  paragraphs announcing that Juan Tellamantez and his wonderful mandolin  could be heard at the Jack Rabbit Grill, or the Pearl of Cadiz Saloon.  Mrs. Tellamantez waited and wept and combed her hair. When he was  completely wrung out and burned up,--all but destroyed,--her Juan always  came back to her to be taken care of,--once with an ugly knife wound in  the neck, once with a finger missing from his right hand,--but he played  just as well with three fingers as he had with four.    Public sentiment was lenient toward Johnny, but everybody was disgusted  with Mrs. Tellamantez for putting up with him. She ought to discipline  him, people said; she ought to leave him; she had no self-respect. In  short, Mrs. Tellamantez got all the blame. Even Thea thought she was  much too humble. To-night, as she sat with her back to the moon, looking  at the moon flowers and Mrs. Tellamantez's somber face, she was thinking  that there is nothing so sad in the world as that kind of patience and  resignation. It was much worse than Johnny's craziness. She even  wondered whether it did not help to make Johnny crazy. People had no  right to be so passive and resigned. She would like to roll over and  over in the sand and screech at Mrs. Tellamantez. She was glad when the  doctor came out.    The Mexican woman rose and stood respectful and expectant. The doctor  held his hat in his hand and looked kindly at her.    \"Same old thing, Mrs. Tellamantez. He's no worse than he's been before.  I've left some medicine. Don't give him anything but toast water until I  see him again. You're a good nurse; you'll get him out.\" Dr. Archie  smiled encouragingly. He glanced about the little garden and wrinkled  his brows. \"I can't see what makes him behave so. He's killing himself,  and he's not a rowdy sort of fellow. Can't you tie him up someway? Can't  you tell when these fits are coming on?\"    Mrs. Tellamantez put her hand to her forehead. \"The saloon, doctor, the  excitement; that is what makes him. People listen to him, and it excites  him.\"    The doctor shook his head. \"Maybe. He's too much for my calculations. I  don't see what he gets out of it.\"    \"He is always fooled,\"--the Mexican woman spoke rapidly and tremulously,  her long under lip quivering.    \"He is good at heart, but he has no head. He fools himself. You do not  understand in this country, you are progressive. But he has no judgment,  and he is fooled.\" She stooped quickly, took up one of the white  conch-shells that bordered the walk, and, with an apologetic inclination  of her head, held it to Dr. Archie's ear. \"Listen, doctor. You hear  something in there? You hear the sea; and yet the sea is very far from  here. You have judgment, and you know that. But he is fooled. To him, it  is the sea itself. A little thing is big to him.\" She bent and placed  the shell in the white row, with its fellows. Thea took it up softly and  pressed it to her own ear. The sound in it startled her; it was like  something calling one. So that was why Johnny ran away. There was  something awe-inspiring about Mrs. Tellamantez and her shell.    Thea caught Dr. Archie's hand and squeezed it hard as she skipped along  beside him back toward Moonstone. She went home, and the doctor went  back to his lamp and his book. He never left his office until after  midnight. If he did not play whist or pool in the evening, he read. It  had become a habit with him to lose himself.          VII    Thea's twelfth birthday had passed a few weeks before her memorable call  upon Mrs. Tellamantez. There was a worthy man in Moonstone who was  already planning to marry Thea as soon as she should be old enough. His  name was Ray Kennedy, his age was thirty, and he was conductor on a  freight train, his run being from Moonstone to Denver. Ray was a big  fellow, with a square, open American face, a rock chin, and features  that one would never happen to remember. He was an aggressive idealist,  a freethinker, and, like most railroad men, deeply sentimental. Thea  liked him for reasons that had to do with the adventurous life he had  led in Mexico and the Southwest, rather than for anything very personal.  She liked him, too, because he was the only one of her friends who ever  took her to the sand hills. The sand hills were a constant  tantalization; she loved them better than anything near Moonstone, and  yet she could so seldom get to them. The first dunes were accessible  enough; they were only a few miles beyond the Kohlers', and she could  run out there any day when she could do her practicing in the morning  and get Thor off her hands for an afternoon. But the real hills--the  Turquoise Hills, the Mexicans called them--were ten good miles away, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#8)"],[1,"conductor in a disordered rehearsal of the melodrama to come. And so  we alight on him in this Rocca, sinister and lonely, the protagonist of  the piece to which he was in a little to supply the most tragic  denouement.    He lay sunk back in pillows on a couch set in an alcove high and apart.  One long, jewelled hand caressed the head of a boarhound.  Judged by the  swift code of his times, he was already mature, a sage of thirty-one.  His eyes were small and deep-seated under gloomy thatches, his forehead  narrow and receding, his cheeks ravenous, his nose was hooked.  But in  contrast with this pinched hunger of feature were the bagging chin and  sensual neck, as well as the grossness of the body, which attenuated  into feeble legs.  One could not look on him and gather from crown to  foot the assurance of a single generous youthful impulse.  The curse of  an inherited despotism had wrinkled him from his birth.    An effeminate luxury, which was presently to make Milan a byword among  the austerer principalities, spoke in his dress.  His short-skirted  tunic, puff-shouldered, and pinched and pleated at the waist within a  gem-encrusted girdle, was of Damascene silk, rose-coloured and lined  with costliest fur.  His hose were of white satin; his slippers, of  crimson velvet, sparkled with rosettes of diamonds and rubies.  On his  head he wore a cap of maintenance, also of red velvet, and sewn with  pearls; and a short jewelled dagger hung at his waist.    By his side, a very foil to his magnificence, stood one in a  sad-coloured cloak.  This was Lascaris, a Greek professor, whom he had  invited to Milan for his learning, and used, like Pharaoh, to expound  him his dreams. For he was subject to evil dreams, was this  Galeazzo--hauntings and visions which wrought in him that state that he  would become a very madman if so little as the shadow of an opposition  crossed his imagination.  And even now such a mood was working in him,  as he lounged darkly conning the life of the hall from his eyrie.    That was a deep, semi-domed alcove, approached from the main chamber by  a short avenue of square-sided pillars, and roofed with a mosaic of  ultramarine and gold, into which were wrought the arms of the Sforzas  and Viscontis, the lilies of France and the red cross of Savoy.  Entablatures of white marble carved into bas-reliefs filled the  inter-columniations of this approach; while the pillars themselves, of  dark green panels inlaid on white, were sprayed and flowered with  exquisite mouldings in gold. The capitals, blossoming crowns of gilt  foliage and marble faces, supported a white cornice, which at the  alcove's mouth ran down into twin fluted shafts, between which rose a  shallow flight of steps to a sort of dais or shrine within.  And thence,  from a carved marble bench, Galeazzo looked down on the soft surging  motley of the throng in the hall below.    Every sound there was instinctively subdued to the occasion: the  laughter of girls, the thrum of lutes, the ring of steel and rustle of  silk.  Not so much as a misdirected glance, even, would venture to  appropriate to the company's cynic merriment the figure of a solitary  captive, who stood bound and guarded at the foot of the dais.  Yet it  was plain that this captive felt the enforced forbearance, and mocked it  with a bitterer cynicism than its own.    He was a small, ill-formed, harsh-featured man, very soberly dressed,  and with a cropped head--a feature sufficiently disdainful of the bushed  and elaborately waved locks of those by whom he was surrounded.  Lean-throated and short-sighted, his face was a face to scorn falsehood  without loving truth, a face the mouthpiece of dead languages for dead  languages' sake, a face the contemner of the present just because it was  the present and alive.  As he stood, loweringly phlegmatic as any caged  hate, his peering eyes and snarling lip would occasionally lift  themselves together, not towards the glittering lord of destinies on the  dais, but towards his henchman, the Greek, who would answer the  challenge with a stare of serene and opulent contempt.  And so a long  interval of silence held them opposed.    Suddenly the Duke stirred from his black reverie, his lips sputtering  little inarticulate blasphemies.  His knee peevishly dismissing the  hound, he gripped an arm of the bench, and turning gloomily on Lascaris,  uttered the one impatient word, 'Well?'    The Greek, temporising for the moment, inclined his smooth,  black-bearded face, so that the oily essence on his hair, which was  foppishly crimped and snooded, was wafted to the Sforza nostrils,  offending their delicacy. Galeazzo, momentarily repelled, rallied to a  harsher frown, and demanded: 'The fruit, man, the fruit of all this  meditation?  Jesu! it should be rotten-ripe by its smell!'    Lascaris expanded his chest, unoffended, and, caressing his beard,  answered impassively:--    'Thou questionest of this vision, Theosutos?  I answer, How many changes  can be rung on a carillon of eight bells?  By such measure shalt thou  imagine, an thou canst, the changes possible to the myriad of particles  that go to the composition of a single human eye.  Now, in the  unthinkable dispersements and readjustments of Infinity, shall it not  sometimes happen that two particles, or two thousand particles, or two  billion particles, out of the sum of particles which were that eye,  shall chance together again, and recover, because of that meeting, some  very ancient, very remote impression which they once absorbed in common?  These, Theosutos, be the ghosts, haphazard, indefinable, visible to one  and unseen of all the rest, which make the solitary seer; these be the  lonely hauntings of the ages--dust blown over desolate places, to  commingle a moment at some cross roads, and weave a phantom wreath of  memory, and so again be cast and scattered among the cycles.  Thy vision  is but a shadow of old dead years.'    An ill-repressed stutter of laughter from the prisoner at the foot of  the steps greeted the finish of this exegesis.  Lascaris flushed  scarcely perceptibly.  The Duke took no more notice of man or sound than  he would have of a whimpering dog.  Once or twice he stammered an oath,  gnawing his finger, and frowning up, and down, and up again at the  Greek.  Finally he broke out, in a fury:--    'Now, by the Host, thou consolest me--now, by the Host!  To reconcile to  this spectre by arguing it perpetual!  To----'    Grinding his teeth, he clipped his long fingers on the bench arm, as if  he were about to spring.  Lascaris forestalled him with a placid word:--    'Not perpetual.  The mood invokes these shadows, as the mood shall lay  them.'    Galeazzo snarled.    'The mood!  What mood, fool?  You shift and shift. God! it will be the  mood of the mood next.  Hast thou no master-key to all?  Go to, then!'    He sank back into his cushions, glooming and panting. The sleek olive  mask of the face near him yielded no sign of perturbation.    Gradually a very deadly expression came to usurp in the Duke's eyes that  blinder madness of desperation. An indolent smile relaxed his features.  He yawned, it was because, the soul horror being temporarily withdrawn,  the incontinent devil was supplanting in him the tempestuous one.  He  rolled lazily about, addressing his creature once more:--    'You doctors--all the same!  Big words to little cures. Treat a State's  constitution or a man's--'tis the word's the thing.  Ye woo not the  truth, but her raiment.  Hear'st me?  I had a tutor once, a crabbed  fellow called Montano.'    He yawned again.  The prisoner below (Cola Montano himself) gasped  slightly, and shot one stealthy glance his way.  Lascaris sniggered.    'Surely, lord,' he said, 'we need no reminding while the man himself  keeps his tongue.'    A half-suppressed snarl broke from the prisoner. Galeazzo, hunched on  his cushions, stared vacantly before him.    'Ah!' he said, 'he could talk.  I remember him, a midwife to the  wind--as ye all be--as ye all be.  What of the fellow?'    Lascaris wondered.    'Little, in truth, Magnificence, save in so far as your Magnificence was  pleased to introduce his name.'    'Did I?  I had forgot.  What was the connection? Empty words, was it  not, and vainglory and presumption?'    'And discontent.  Add it thereto, Illustrious.'    'Discontent?  Of what?  The man prospers, I understand, on his school of  all the virtues.  Discontent? Why, hath he not risen to that  independence of power that he dares lampoon his prince?  Discontent?'    'Like Alexander, thou standest in his light, Theosutos.'    'Discontent?'    'Ay, that he should be twitted with having schooled a despot.'    'Why, true; he taught me how to score a lesson with a scourge.  My  shoulders could tell.'    'Gods! did he dare?'    'He dared.  'Twas a fellow of Roman mettle.'    'He would dare more now.'    'What?'    'A republic, so they say.'    'Ah! he should be the man for visions--a seer, an exorcist.'    'Short-sighted for a seer, Illustrious.  The man cannot see the length  of his own nose.'    'Yet may he see far.  I would he were here.'    The prisoner, wrought at last beyond self-control, turned on the Greek  and squirted a little shriek of venom--    'Yet through and through thee, thou loathsome, envious pimp!'    Then he whipped upon the other--    'And why not a republic, Galeazzo?  Thy father Francesco was a  republican at heart, else had he never given his son's leading-strings  into my hands.  There was a confederacy dreamed of in his day--Genoa,  Milan, and Venice; Florence, Sienna, and Bologna.  One rampart to the  rolling Alps, one wall on which barbarian hordes might burst and waste  themselves in foam. Northwards, a baffled sea; south, all Italy a  tranquil haven, a watered garden, where knowledge with all its flowers  should find space, and breathing-space to grow. Dost thou love Italy?  Then why not a republic, Galeazzo?'  "]]]
