You see he had such a kind little twinkle in  his eyes that she felt happy right away as she replied, \"Oh, I'm Little  Girl, and I wanted so much to see Santa that I just came, and here I  am!\"    \"Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!\" laughed Santa, \"and here you are! Wanted to see  Santa, did you, and so you came! Now that's very nice, and it's too bad  I'm in such a hurry, for we should like nothing better than to show you  about and give you a real good time. But you see it is quarter of twelve  now, and I must be on my way at once, else I'll never reach that first  chimney-top by midnight. I'd call Mrs. Santa and ask her to get you  some supper, but she is busy finishing dolls' clothes which must be  done before morning, and I guess we'd better not bother her. Is there  anything that you would like, Little Girl?\" and good old Santa put  his big warm hand on Little Girl's curls and she felt its warmth and  kindness clear down to her very heart. You see, my dears, that even  though Santa was in such a great hurry, he wasn't too busy to stop and  make some one happy for a minute, even if it was some one no bigger than  Little Girl.    So she smiled back into Santa's face and said: \"Oh, Santa, if I could  ONLY ride down to Earth with you behind those splendid reindeer! I'd  love to go; won't you PLEASE take me? I'm so small that I won't take up  much room on the seat, and I'll keep very still and not bother one bit!\"    Then Santa laughed, SUCH a laugh, big and loud and rollicking, and he  said, \"Wants a ride, does she? Well, well, shall we take her, Little  Elves? Shall we take her, Little Fairies? Shall we take her, Good  Reindeer?\"    And all the Little Elves hopped and skipped and brought Little Girl a  sprig of holly; and all the Little Fairies bowed and smiled and brought  her a bit of mistletoe; and all the Good Reindeer jingled their bells  loudly, which meant, \"Oh, yes! let's take her! She's a good Little  Girl! Let her ride!\" And before Little Girl could even think, she found  herself all tucked up in the big fur robes beside Santa, and away they  went, right out into the air, over the clouds, through the Milky Way,  and right under the very handle of the Big Dipper, on, on, toward the  Earthland, whose lights Little Girl began to see twinkling away down  below her. Presently she felt the runners scrape upon something, and  she knew they must be on some one's roof, and that Santa would slip down  some one's chimney in a minute.    How she wanted to go, too! You see if you had never been down a chimney  and seen Santa fill up the stockings, you would want to go quite as  much as Little Girl did, now, wouldn't you? So, just as Little Girl  was wishing as hard as ever she could wish, she heard a Tiny Voice say,  \"Hold tight to his arm! Hold tight to his arm!\" So she held Santa's arm  tight and close, and he shouldered his pack, never thinking that it  was heavier than usual, and with a bound and a slide, there they were,  Santa, Little Girl, pack and all, right in the middle of a room where  there was a fireplace and stockings all hung up for Santa to fill.    Just then Santa noticed Little Girl. He had forgotten all about her for  a minute, and he was very much surprised to find that she had come, too.  \"Bless my soul!\" he said, \"where did you come from, Little Girl? and  how in the world can we both get back up that chimney again? It's easy  enough to slide down, but it's quite another matter to climb up again!\"  and Santa looked real worried. But Little Girl was beginning to feel  very tired by this time, for she had had a very exciting evening, so she  said, \"Oh, never mind me, Santa. I've had such a good time, and I'd  just as soon stay here a while as not. I believe I'll curl up on his  hearth-rug a few minutes and have a little nap, for it looks as warm and  cozy as our own hearth-rug at home, and--why, it is our own hearth and  it's my own nursery, for there is Teddy Bear in his chair where I leave  him every night, and there's Bunny Cat curled up on his cushion in the  corner.\"    And Little Girl turned to thank Santa and say goodbye to him, but  either he had gone very quickly, or else she had fallen asleep very  quickly--she never could tell which--for the next thing she knew, Daddy  was holding her in his arms and was saying, \"What is my Little Girl  doing here? She must go to bed, for it's Christmas Eve, and old Santa  won't come if he thinks there are any little folks about.\"    But Little Girl knew better than that, and when she began to tell him  all about it, and how the Christmas fairies had welcomed her, and how  Santa had given her such a fine ride, Daddy laughed and laughed, and  said, \"You've been dreaming, Little Girl, you've been dreaming.\"    But Little Girl knew better than that, too, for there on the hearth was  the little Black Coal, which had given her Two Shoes and Bright Light,  and tight in her hand she held a holly berry which one of the Christmas  Sprites had placed there. More than all that, there she was on the  hearth-rug herself, just as Santa had left her, and that was the best  proof of all.    The trouble was, Daddy himself had never been a Little Girl, so he  couldn't tell anything about it, but we know she hadn't been dreaming,  now, don't we, my dears?          VII. \"A CHRISTMAS MATINEE\"*    *This story was first published in the Youth's Companion, vol. 74.    MRS. M.A.L. LANE    It was the day before Christmas in the year 189-. Snow was falling  heavily in the streets of Boston, but the crowd of shoppers seemed  undiminished. As the storm increased, groups gathered at the corners and  in sheltering doorways to wait for belated cars; but the holiday cheer  was in the air, and there was no grumbling. Mothers dragging tired  children through the slush of the streets; pretty girls hurrying home  for the holidays; here and there a harassed-looking man with perhaps a  single package which he had taken a whole morning to select--all had the  same spirit of tolerant good-humor.    \"School Street! School Street!\" called the conductor of an electric car.  A group of young people at the farther end of the car started to  their feet. One of them, a young man wearing a heavy fur-trimmed coat,  addressed the conductor angrily.    \"I said, 'Music Hall,' didn't I?\" he demanded. \"Now we've got to walk  back in the snow because of your stupidity!\"    \"Oh, never mind, Frank!\" one of the girls interposed. \"We ought to have  been looking out ourselves! Six of us, and we went by without a  thought! It is all Mrs. Tirrell's fault! She shouldn't have been so  entertaining!\"    The young matron dimpled and blushed. \"That's charming of you, Maidie,\"  she said, gathering up her silk skirts as she prepared to step down into  the pond before her. \"The compliment makes up for the blame. But how it  snows!\"    \"It doesn't matter. We all have gaiters on,\" returned Maidie Williams,  undisturbed.    \"Fares, please!\" said the conductor stolidly.    Frank Armstrong thrust his gloved hand deep into his pocket with angry  vehemence. \"There's your money,\" he said, \"and be quick about the  change, will you? We've lost time enough!\"    The man counted out the change with stiff, red fingers, closed his lips  firmly as if to keep back an obvious rejoinder, rang up the six fares  with careful accuracy, and gave the signal to go ahead. The car went on  into the drifting storm.    Armstrong laughed shortly as he rapidly counted the bits of silver lying  in his open palm. He turned instinctively, but two or three cars were  already between him and the one he was looking for.    \"The fellow must be an imbecile,\" he said, rejoining the group on the  crossing. \"He's given me back a dollar and twenty cents, and I handed  him a dollar bill.\"    \"Oh, can't you stop him?\" cried Maidie Williams, with a backward step  into the wet street.    The Harvard junior, who was carrying her umbrella, protested: \"What's  the use. Miss Williams? He'll make it up before he gets to Scollay  Square, you may be sure. Those chaps don't lose anything. Why, the  other day, I gave one a quarter and he went off as cool as you please.  'Where's my change?' said I. 'You gave me a nickel,' said he. And  there wasn't anybody to swear that I didn't except myself, and I didn't  count.\"    \"But that doesn't make any difference,\" insisted the girl warmly.  \"Because one conductor was dishonest, we needn't be. I beg your pardon,  Frank, but it does seem to me just stealing.\"    \"Oh, come along!\" said her cousin, with an easy laugh. \"I guess the West  End Corporation won't go without their dinners to-morrow. Here, Maidie,  here's the ill-gotten fifty cents. _I_ think you ought to treat us  all after the concert; still, I won't urge you. I wash my hands of all  responsibility. But I do wish you hadn't such an unpleasant conscience.\"    Maidie flushed under the sting of his cousinly rudeness, but she went on  quietly with the rest. It was evident that any attempt to overtake the  car was out of the question.    \"Did you notice his number, Frank?\" she asked, suddenly.    \"No, I never thought of it\" said Frank, stopping short. \"However, I  probably shouldn't make any complaint if I had. I shall forget all about  it tomorrow. I find it's never safe to let the sun go down on my wrath.  It's very likely not to be there the next day.\"    \"I wasn't thinking of making a complaint,\" said Maidie; but the two  young men were enjoying the small joke too much to notice what she said.    The great doorway of Music Hall was just ahead. In a moment the party  were within its friendly shelter, stamping off the snow. The girls  were adjusting veils and hats with adroit feminine touches; the pretty  chaperon was beaming approval upon them, and the young men were taking  off their wet overcoats, when Maidie turned again in sudden"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#8)"],[1," of Singapore, near the waterfront, there is a street called  Bukum Street. It is actually little more than an alley crowded on both  sides with rickety two story frame buildings with open store fronts  on the lower floors. They say that when you want to find Bukum Street  you don't bother to ask a native policeman. You simply stand still and  sniff. Then follow the most terrible smell of them all, and at its  source you will find Bukum Street.    \"Halfway along the waterfront side of Bukum Street there is a little  spice and coffee shop very appropriately called the Devil's Den. It  is owned and operated by a man named Serrangi who looks as old as the  city itself. He is a Sumatran, as far as we can find out, but I fancy  he has a little of all the bloods of the Far East in his veins. He is a  hideous looking creature. Face terribly scarred, and he has a cast in  his right eye. But he is more diabolically clever than Satan, himself.  We know that he is a thief, that he would murder any one for you for  the price of a few pennies, and, that there is no intrigue brewing  in which he hasn't got at least the tip of his finger. But, to our  discredit, if you wish, the British Singapore authorities haven't been  able to catch him redhanded in a single thing. Personally, I think we  should throw the beggar in prison, and be done with it. Unfortunately,  though, the white man's laws do not operate that way. Also, Serrangi  has a tremendous influence with the native population. To punish  Serrangi without proof of guilt might stir up a beautiful native riot.  And so, we've only been able to watch and wait ... and hope. And to  date we're no better off than we were two years ago.\"    \"Serrangi and his Devil's Den is the leak, sir?\" murmured Freddy Farmer  as the senior officer paused for breath.    \"We don't know,\" was the blunt reply. \"You see, this business is so  confoundedly twisted up that anything might be possible. It might even  be possible that Serrangi is loyal to the Crown, though I'm sure I  would drop dead from the shock if such proof even came to my attention.  But I'm only telling you what we suspect, not what we know. And the  first item on our long list of suspicions is that all Axis spies  entering or leaving Singapore do so through the Devil's Den. In short  that Serrangi's place is ... you might say ... the clearing house for  information. A couple of months ago a known Nazi spy ... one high up in  the Gestapo by the way ... was picked up as he left the Devil's Den.  We found nothing of interest on his person, however. And we could not  prove that he had gone to Serrangi's for any other reason than to make  a few purchases. Also, not over two weeks ago one of our agents was  last seen entering Serrangi's. We never saw him again. We haven't even  found his body yet. And an authorized search of the Devil's Den brought  to light absolutely nothing!\"    The Air Vice Marshal paused and clenched both fists in a helpless  gesture.    \"Working in the East is so utterly different from working in the West!\"  he said bitterly. \"In England we could close up a place like the  Devil's Den, and burn it to the ground, if we thought it was necessary.  And toss the lot of them in prison, to boot. But you can't do that  sort of thing out here. Not unless you want to have native trouble on  your hands. Anyway, we feel certain that if we could learn even a few  of the secrets of Serrangi's place we would be able to profit as much  as though we had an extra dozen divisions of trained troops, together  with aircraft, and the like. Now, here is the part that concerns you.  And....\"    The Intelligence Officer stopped talking abruptly and stared hard at  the two youths.    \"This is entirely outside your line of duty,\" he said almost harshly.  \"Just because I am telling you all this does not mean in the slightest  that you must agree to go through with the thing. You two are R.A.F.  pilots, and there's still plenty for you to do as such. I mean....  Well, that is....\"    \"Why not just tell us, sir?\" Dave interrupted with an encouraging grin  as the senior officer fumbled for words. \"If we get cold feet, or think  we'd flop the thing, we promise to tell you.\"    \"Thanks, Dawson,\" the Air Vice Marshal said gravely. \"Very well, then.  I want to get you two into Serrangi's place, by hook or by crook. No  one knows you have come to Singapore. I mean, the Harkness has arrived  but you weren't aboard. Of course, by now those damn Axis agents, that  have been virtually living in my pockets without my knowing it, must  know that two pilots took off from the Harkness before she reached  port; that their arrival at Singapore is long over-due, and that this  Catalina has gone out to try and find them. Well, this Catalina is  going to return to Singapore R.A.F. Base, her flight a failure. Yes, we  found the half submerged wreckage of the Harkness' plane. But, _no_  sign of the two who were in it. Examination of the wreckage showed that  the craft had obviously been shot down. How, we don't know. We are only  certain that the two pilots in her are dead. The sharks must have got  them.\"    Dave Dawson licked his lower lip and glanced sidewise at Freddy Farmer.    \"Imagine how the shark that got you feels!\" he chuckled.    \"Is that so!\" the English youth snapped. \"Well, it's always been  difficult to tell from the look on your face whether you were dead or  alive. So you fit the part perfectly, my lad.\"    \"Ouch!\" Dave cried and winced. Then grinning at the Intelligence  officer he said, \"Go ahead, sir. Don't mind us. It's the way we let off  steam, I guess.\"    \"More should adopt the method,\" the Air Vice Marshal said firmly. \"But  this business is far from a joke. It is far more serious than I can  tell you. To be very brutal about it, by this time tomorrow it's quite  possible that you and Farmer _may be_....\"    The senior officer didn't finish. Instead he stuck out a clenched fist  and then extended the thumb downward toward the compartment floor. The  gesture was more explanatory than words. Dave felt a tingling chill  ripple through his heart but he kept the grin on his face. After a  moment the Air Intelligence officer continued.    \"You two will be reported as definitely dead,\" he said. \"I'll make no  bones about being certain of that. I fancy we'll even drink a silent  toast to you at evening mess. You know, do the thing up right for the  benefit of listening ears or watching eyes. Meantime, you two will  proceed to Bukum Street and go into the Devil's Den. Both of you speak  German, and French, and, of course, English. You will have to decide  for yourselves what language you want to use. You'll be.... Well,  you'll be wharf rats to all appearances. Or you can be a couple of  French merchant sailors stranded in Singapore after jumping ship. You  can be a couple of Germans rescued from a China boat sunk off shore.  Fact is, you can be anything you like. It will be frankly up to you to  decide each move as you go along.\"    \"Aren't you just a bit ahead of things, sir?\" Freddy Farmer said as the  flush mounted in his cheeks. \"I mean, how do we get ashore from this  Catalina? And what about clothes?\"    \"That's the easiest part of the whole thing,\" the other replied. \"We'll  talk about that later. Now, the moment you enter the Devil's Den your  lives will be in your own hands. I cannot tell you what you will find.  I cannot tell you what will happen. I'd be a blasted miracle maker, if  I could. But, I can tell you this. We know the identification code word  of Nazi agents out here in the Far East. It's three words, as a matter  of fact. _Der Fuehrer's Tag._ Meaning, of course, The Leader's Day. How  and when you use it, I do not know. And....\"    The Air Vice Marshal paused and groaned softly.    \"And I have got to tell you this,\" he said presently. \"The British  Intelligence agent who entered the Devil's Den two weeks ago, never to  be seen again, was _also_ armed with the code word, or words. I am as  certain, though, as I am that I'm sitting here, that the Nazi agent  identification signal has not been changed. They still use it, and you  two will have to decide the proper time, and place, to mention it.\"    \"A salute when you take a sip of your coffee might be a good idea,\"  Dave said, looking at Freddy. \"Sort of say it under your breath, but  loud enough for anyone sitting close to hear.\"    Dave turned his head and looked at Air Vice Marshal Bostworth.    \"Your plan is for us to be a couple of Axis agents reporting, isn't it,  Sir?\" he asked.    The Air Intelligence officer gave Dawson a look of frank admiration,  and nodded instantly.    \"Exactly that,\" he said. \"I'm sure new agents sent out go straight to  Serrangi's place. Of course, there may be some one to whom they report.  I don't know. That's the risk you've got to take. But here's a plan to  cover that part. You can be a couple of Axis agents shipping from China  to ... say Australia. Your boat was sunk.... I can give you the names  of several ships sunk in the South China Sea recently ... and you were  put ashore in Singapore. You, of course, have known of the Devil's Den,  and you know the code words for identification.\"    \"That's a splendid arrangement, sir!\" Freddy Farmer spoke up excitedly.  \"That way we won't have to show any papers. We can say we lost  everything at sea. But....\"    The English youth stopped short and scowled.    \"But what, Farmer?\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth prompted.    It was a few seconds before Freddy acted as though he had heard.    \"I was thinking, sir,\" he said slowly, \"what if nobody pays any  attention to us? What if we just go into this Devil's Den, and nothing  happens?\"    \"We've got to hope hard that something will,\" the Air Intelligence  officer said grimly. \"And I don't think you need worry about nobody  paying any attention to you. You'll be strangers, and you'll look the  part of seamen put ashore from a lost ship. I'm quite "]]]
