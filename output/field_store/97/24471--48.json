This is what President Cannon said:  \"A prevalent idea has been that this prejudice against us owes its  origin and continuation to our belief in a plurality of wives; but when  it is recollected that the mobbings, drivings, and expulsions from  cities, counties and states which we have endured, and our exodus to  these mountains all took place before the revelation of that doctrine  was PUBLICLY known, it will be seen at once that our belief in it has  not been the cause of persecution.\" Now, I ask, is it not plain to  see why his quotation stopped in the middle of a sentence? The Saints  all know that President George Q. Cannon was always faithful to his  testimony that plural marriage was introduced by the Prophet Joseph  Smith. Latter-day Saints generally declare that this doctrine was not  _publicly_ known in the days of Joseph the Seer, but that it was taught  by him to his trusted friends. When this fact is known the alleged  quotations which follow, purported to be from H. B. Clawson, Ephraim  Jensen and \"Elder Whitaker\" lose their force.    5. This is not in the Salt Lake Herald of February 9, 1852.    6. The following is the Brooklyn _Citizen's_ report of that same  discourse from which Mr. Evans quotes his passage as given in the New  York _Herald_: Elder Whitaker said: \"The people of the East have been  led to believe that polygamy was alone responsible for all the troubles  of the Mormons, but the fact remains, that as the fight was waged  against Jesus Christ, against his followers, and against all great men  for declaring the truth, so the same spirit is manifest now; but the  Mormons will humbly seek those willing to accept the truths inspired  of God, leaving the justice of their cause to be vindicated by honest  investigation and time. The fight is directed against the doctrine of  the Mormon Church, though polygamy has done such yeoman service in  arousing public sentiment, to attain certain ends unworthy of honest  men. The crusaders have kept the public mind from the real cause of  the attack. From the time the Church was organized in 1830-47, when  the people, after many previous drivings, persecutions, mobbings and  cruel mockings, were driven to Utah, the cry of polygamy was never made  a cause of their persecutions; indeed, that subject was not committed  in writing until 1843, never published to the world until 1852, and  was abandoned by the issuance of the 'Manifesto' of President Wilford  Woodruff, in 1890, since which time not one polygamous marriage has  been solemnized; but those having wives at that time were never asked,  and it was never expected they would abandon them, and when death  brings such relations to a close, there will be no polygamy among the  Mormons.\" The Brooklyn _Citizen_, Monday, January 8, 1900.    Why Mr. Evans accepted the brief extract from the New York _Herald_ in  preference to the full account in the Brooklyn _Citizen_ will require  no comment, but it certainly does appear that Elder Whitaker _did_ know  who introduced \"polygamy.\"    As I do not have the Yeoman's _Shield_ and am not in communication  with Elder Ephraim Jenson, I cannot vouch for his remarks, but feel  safe in saying that if the whole report were published, his testimony  would agree with that of Elder Whitaker as published in the Brooklyn  _Citizen_.    7. In quoting from \"The Mysteries of Mormonism, by an Apostle's  Wife,\" Mr. Evans reveals the character of his \"dozens and dozens of  witnesses.\" The reader will perceive that he depends largely on the  most bitter anti-\"Mormons\" and apostates for his \"evidence,\" but in  quoting from \"The Mysteries of Mormonism, by an Apostle's Wife,\" he  certainly reaches the climax of this base testimony. This work was  published in 1882, by Richard K. Fox, proprietor of the notorious  _Police Gazette_. The author of these \"Mysteries,\" undoubtedly a  man, assumes the title of \"An Apostle's Wife,\" in order to hide his  perfidy. The work is one of the vilest and most contemptible of all  anti-\"Mormon\" publications, and is most bitter in its denunciation of  the Prophet Joseph Smith. In it he is called a \"lusty toper,\" \"the  worst of a bad breed,\" \"an ignorant, brutal loafer,\" \"immoral, false  and fraudulent,\" and the author says, \"_this_ is the man who founded  what he dared to call a faith, and grafted on the United States the  religion of licentiousness and bodily lust known as Mormonism.\" An  apology is perhaps due for even referring to this matter, but since Mr.  Evans makes this work one of the chief of his \"dozens and dozens of  witnesses,\" I feel that he should be exposed. He professes to believe  in the divine mission of Joseph Smith, and yet calls upon us to accept  the wicked falsehoods of this disreputable witness, whom he declares  \"_ought to know whereof she affirms_.\" Shame upon the man who draws his  inspiration from such a source!    8. This whole statement is absolutely false, and there was not the  least shadow of reason for uttering it. President Smith's first wife  did not refuse to consent to additional wives. He did not marry two  sisters on the same day. In depending on the unreliable Alfred Henry  Lewis for his argument, Mr. Evans shows the desperate weakness of his  position. It would be a hard matter to squeeze more falsehoods in the  space occupied by the article of A. H. Lewis, from which Mr. Evans  quotes so faithfully.    9. This letter is dated March 1, 1905, but was not written until  sometime after April 19, 1905, for on the latter date Mr. Evans wrote:  \"You may look for reply to your letter as it appeared in the Toronto  _Star_, as soon as I have time to reply thereto.\" This reply was  received May 5, 1905.        A REJOINDER TO MR. R. C. EVANS' LETTER                                               Salt Lake City, May 23, 1905.    _Mr. R. C. Evans_,    _Counselor in Presidency of Reorganized Church_.    Sir:--Your reply to my open letter of February 17 was received May  5. Whether I was \"fair, dispassionate and also candid\" in my letter,  or, as you seem to think, \"guilty of a labored effort to cover up the  true facts regarding 'blood atonement, polygamy, etc.'\" and \"your  faith\"--which was not discussed--I am perfectly willing to leave to the  judgment of \"those who read\" the same in the Toronto _Star_. So on this  point we may both rest satisfied.      BLOOD ATONEMENT    I will now consider your \"labored effort to cover up the _true facts_  regarding blood atonement.\"    In my letter I candidly placed the true belief and teachings of the  Latter-day Saints in relation to this doctrine before you. This fact  appears to be displeasing to you, as it overturns your conclusions  and accusations against our people. If you desire to know the correct  position of the Church on this doctrine, I would recommend a careful  study of John Taylor's _Meditation and Atonement_ and Charles W.  Penrose's _Blood Atonement_, which was published in answer to such  wicked misrepresentations as I claim you have made in relation to this  principle and our belief in relation thereto. There is no reason for  any person to misunderstand our position, unless he desires to do so.  I claim, too, that we are in a better position to teach that which  we believe than is the stranger who attempts to present our case,  especially if he is antagonistic or unfriendly.    If you do not believe the doctrine of blood atonement as that doctrine  is taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which  church you are pleased to call \"Utah Mormonism,\" then I say that you  _do not_ believe in the atonement of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  To this I will refer later.    You delight--as all anti-\"Mormons\" do--in referring to statements  made by President Brigham Young, Jedediah M. Grant and others during  the troublous times preceding the advent of Johnston's army into  Utah. I see, too, that like many others, you place your own _desired_  interpretation on their remarks, place them before the public in a  garbled state, taking care to give the darkest interpretation possible  from which the public may gather false conclusions. You take great  pains to cover up the conditions prevailing which called forth such  extreme and in some instances unwise remarks. Conditions in some  respects akin to those surrounding the Saints in Missouri in 1838-39  when other unwise remarks were made by members of the leading quorums  of the Church, but in a sense justifiable and which should be condoned  under the trying circumstances that called them forth.[1]      THE CHURCH JUDGED FROM ITS ACCEPTED STANDARDS    Writing on this subject Elder B. H. Roberts, in his criticism on Harry  Leon Wilson's plagarisms in his _Lions of the Lord_, declares the  position taken by members of the Church and all fair-minded men in  these words:        \"The justice of Burke's assertion has never been questioned, and      without any wresting whatever it may be applied to \"Mormon\" leaders      who sometimes spoke and acted under the recollection of rank      injustice perpetrated against themselves and their people; or to      rebuke rising evils against which their souls revolted.\"    Even the president of the Reorganized Church recognized this fact in  his answer to _The American Baptist_, wherein he said:        \"Whoever counseled or did evil in those times (in Missouri) are      responsible, personally, therefor; but the church, as such is no      more responsible for it than were the early Christians for Peter's      attempt to kill the high priest's servant when he cut off his      ear with his sword. The church, as such, should be judged by its      authorized doctrines and deeds, and not by the unauthorized sayings      or doings of some or many of its members or ministers.        It is not to be wondered at that in those times when the embryo      authors and abettors of the \"Border Ruffianism\" that reigned in      Missouri and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50536"],[0,"Gospel Themes: A Treatise on Salient Features of \"Mormonism\" (#8)"],[1,"the divine Nazarene that has caused  Christian nations to thrive, that has enabled Christianity, in spite of  its errors, to flourish, to survive the wreck of empires and weather  the storms of time? Was not Christ indeed as \"lightning out of heaven,\"  sent down to kindle and illumine the world, and has not the world been  warmer and brighter for his coming? Is it not the faith of any nation,  its trust in and reliance upon some power deemed by it divine, that  constitutes its main strength?    Faith Must Be Genuine.--But faith must be genuine. Pretense and  formalism will not avail. Hypocrisy is the worst form of unbelief.  Honest idolatry is infinitely preferable to dishonest worship. Better  burn incense to Diana, believing it to be right, than bow down to  Christ in hollow-hearted insincerity. Mighty Rome did not fall, until  she had ceased to worship sincerely the gods enshrined within her  Pantheon. Glorious Greece did not succumb, until she had proved false  to her ancient faith, until her believers had become doubters, until  skeptical philosophy had supplanted religious enthusiasm, and the  worship of freedom, grace, and beauty had degenerated to unbridled  license and groveling sensuality. No nation ever crumbled to ruin until  false to itself, false to the true principles of success, the basic one  of which is to believe.    The Articles of Faith.--What should Latter-day Saints believe? I can  think of no better answer to this question than is contained in the  Articles of Faith, formulated by the Prophet Joseph Smith soon after  the Church of Christ was organized in this dispensation:    \"1. We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in his Son Jesus Christ,  and in the Holy Ghost.    \"2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not  for Adam's transgression.    \"3. We believe that through the atonement of Christ all men may be  saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.    \"4. We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel  are:--First, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, repentance; third,  baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, laying on of  hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.    \"5. We believe that a man must be called of God by prophecy, and by the  laying on of hands, by those who are in authority, to preach the gospel  and administer in the ordinances thereof.    \"6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the primitive  church, viz.: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.    \"7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions,  healing, interpretation of tongues, etc.    \"8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is  translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word  of God.    \"9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that he does now reveal,  and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things  pertaining to the kingdom of God.    \"10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the  restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion will be built upon this  continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth: and that  the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisaical glory.    \"11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the  dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege,  let them worship how, where, or what they may.    \"12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers and  magistrates, in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law.    \"13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous,  and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the  admonition of Paul, We believe all things, we hope all things, we have  endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there  is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we  seek after these things.\"        CHAPTER IV.    Repentance.    The First Fruit of Faith.--The first fruit of faith is repentance.  Repentance follows faith as naturally as kindness follows love, as  obedience springs from reverence, as a desire to be congenial with,  succeeds admiration for, one whose example is deemed worthy of  emulation. God commands all men everywhere to repent. A desire to  please him and become acceptable in his sight, leads the soul of faith  of repentance.    A Gift from God.--No repentance is possible, however, without the  Spirit of the Lord, which \"giveth light to every man that cometh into  the world\" (D&C 84:45-47). This is what makes repentance, no less than  faith, a gift from God. When his Spirit ceases to strive with men, they  no longer desire to repent, and are delivered over to the buffetings  of Satan. They deliver themselves over to those buffetings. They make  their choice between the spirit of good and the spirit of evil, both of  which are in the world, influencing the spirit of man, and they receive  their wages from the master whom they list to obey.    The Spirit of God and the Holy Ghost.--A distinction should be drawn  between the Spirit \"that enlighteneth every man,\" and the Holy Ghost,  whose gifts are given to members of the Church of Christ. The former  is an influence, proceeding from the Divine Presence; the latter a  personage, one of the Godhead, concerning whom the Prophet Joseph says:  \"The Father has a body of flesh and bones, as tangible as man's; the  Son also; but the Holy Ghost is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so  the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us\" (D&C 130:22).    The Prophet says further upon this subject: \"There is a difference  between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius  received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the  convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the gospel, but he  could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, until after he was  baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the  Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God would have left  him.\"--(\"Joseph Smith's Teachings,\" p. 69.)    Real Repentance.--Repentance is not that superficial sorrow felt by a  criminal when caught in the act of wrong-doing--a sorrow not for sin,  but for sin's detection, for being taken in transgression. Chagrin  is not repentance. Mortification and shame, alone, bring no change  of heart toward right living or right feeling. Repentance involves  remorse; but even remorse is not all there is to repentance. In its  highest meaning and fullest measure, repentance is equivalent to  reformation--a resolve to \"sin no more,\" backed by conduct consistent  with such a determination. \"Repentance is a thing that cannot be  trifled with every day. Daily transgression and daily repentance is  not that which is pleasing in the sight of God\" (\"Joseph Smith's  Teachings,\" p. 136). \"By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his  sins. Behold, he will confess them and forsake them\" (D&C 58:43). This  is a real, genuine repentance. All who truly repent can be forgiven.  These, and these alone, are ready for the cleansing process--baptism  for the remission of sins. Without repentance, there is no forgiveness,  and consequently no remission of sins.    Damnation No Part of the Gospel.--Damnation is no part of the gospel.  Damnation or condemnation is simply the sad alternative, the inevitable  consequence of rejecting the means of escape. When men hear the gospel  and refuse to obey it, the come under condemnation. This cannot be  helped. God would save them, but they will not be saved. They are free  agents, and they damn themselves. Says Joseph the prophet: \"When God  offers knowledge or a gift to a man, and he refuses to receive it,  he will be damned.\" Not because God wishes to damn him, but because  damnation is inevitable when one rejects the offer of salvation.    Sin, a Wilful Transgression of Law.--A man sins when he goes contrary  to light and knowledge--that is, contrary to the light and knowledge  that has come to him. One may blunder in ignorance, and suffer painful  consequences; but one does not sin unless one knows better than to do  the thing in which the sin consists.    Carlyle on Repentance.--\"Of all acts,\" says Carlyle, \"is not, for a  man, repentance the most divine? The deadliest sin, I say, were that  same supercilious consciousness of no sin;--that is death; the heart so  conscious is divorced from sincerity, humility and fact; is dead: it is  'pure' as dead dry sand is pure.\"--\"Heroes and Hero-Worship,\" Lecture  II.    Condemnation Measured by Culpability.--They who refuse to repent will  be damned; they damn themselves by that refusal. But damnation is not  necessarily permanent, and like salvation or exaltation, it exists in  degrees. The degree of condemnation is according to the measure of  culpability in those condemned. Even the damned, who repent, can be  saved.    Some Souls Incapable of Repentance.--Some sinners cannot repent. Their  sins are of such a heinous character as to preclude it. The spirit of  repentance cannot lay hold upon them. T heir conduct has so grieved  it, that it is completely withdrawn. Consequently they cannot repent,  and that is what makes their case hopeless. If they could repent, they  could be forgiven; but not being able to repent, the pardoning power  cannot reach them. There would be no unpardonable sin if all sinners  were capable of repentance. Those who cannot repent, who have committed  the sin unpardonable, are called sons of perdition.    A Hint from Shakespeare.--Apropos of the inability to repent,  Shakespeare gives a philosophic hint in his tragedy of \"Hamlet.\"  Claudius, brother to the king of Denmark, has murdered the king  in order to obtain his crown and queen. But remorse gnaws at the  murderer's conscience--not a godly remorse, leading to repentance,  but the terror that guilty souls feel at the prospect of judgment and  retribution. Claudius kneels to pray, but "]]]
