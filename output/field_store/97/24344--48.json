There is little sport in shooting this  variety. The food of this species, like all other mountain dwelling  grouse, is buds, tender shoots and seeds, berries and insects when  obtainable.    =Color=--Male--Upper parts gray, the central back and the wings having  a brownish hue; the tail-coverts, which are tipped with broad  splashes of white is a distinguishing feature of this species;  feathers, on the flanks tipped broadly with white, throat, black,  imperfectly edged with white; tail, nearly square at the end and of a  brownish color.    Female--Considerably more of an ochreous cast. It has the same  characteristic broad white tips on the feathers of the flanks; tail,  dirty ochre, mottled with black and narrowly tipped with white.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is a depression in the ground in some  secluded place and lined with leaves or grass. The eggs, averaging  about a dozen, are of a reddish buff mottled with brown.    =Measurements=--Total length about 15 inches; wing about 7 inches.  Weight from one and a half to two pounds.        [Illustration: SAGE COCK (Centrocercus europhasianus)]      THE SAGE HEN    (Centrocercus urophasianus)    The sage grouse, or sage hen is the largest of the grouse of America,  some of the males weighing as much as seven pounds. Its range, so far  as the geographical scope of this work is concerned, is northeastern  California, Nevada, and eastern Oregon and Washington, but it extends  much farther east. It is only found in the sage brush districts of the  high altitudes. They usually remain in single broods, though they are  sometimes found in much larger flocks. They often travel for  considerable distances, \"following the leader\" in single file. They  strut in the nesting season, but in a peculiar way, pushing their  breasts on the ground until the feathers are worn off and even the  skin abraded.    A peculiarity of the sage grouse is that it has no gizzard, but  instead it has a stomach more like that of an animal. The young birds  lie quite well to a dog and furnish very good sport, and until they  are about half grown the flesh is quite good, but the older birds are  very unsavory and in fact almost unpalatable. This is caused by their  feeding almost entirely upon the leaves of the sage.    =Color=--Male--Upper parts, gray, barred with brown; tail, very long,  the longer feathers being quite narrow and stiff and barred also with  brown; a dark line over the eye and a light one from the eye down the  side of the neck; throat and cheeks, nearly white, mottled with black;  a few long hairy like feathers grow from the side of the neck of the  male birds.    Female--The female is colored and marked like the male but  considerably darker, is much smaller, with shorter tail and without  the hairy feathers on the side of the neck.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is nothing more than a hollow in the midst  of some bunch of brush, possibly lined with a few leaves. The eggs are  from twelve to eighteen in number and of a greenish shade, mottled  with bright brown, but these spots are easily rubbed off.    =Measurements=--Male--Total length from 24 to 28 inches; wing,  12 to 14. Weight, from four to seven pounds.    Female--Total length, from 20 to 22 inches; wing, 10 to 12. Weight,  from three to five pounds.        [Illustration: SHARP-TAIL GROUSE                   (Pediocaetes phasianellus columbianus)]      COLUMBIAN SHARP-TAILED GROUSE    (Pediocaetes phasianellus columbianus)    The Columbian sharp-tailed grouse is the \"prairie chicken\" of eastern  Washington. It is far different from the pinated grouse  (=Tympanuchus=) of the middle states, commonly called prairie chicken.  Its habitat is much the same, however, being the open plains and  untimbered foothills east of the Cascade mountains in Washington and  through eastern Oregon into northern Nevada, and the extreme  northeastern corner of California. The sharp-tail grouse has the same  habit of strutting in large groups like the prairie chicken at the  beginning of the nesting season. They do not drum, however, like the  eastern bird, but make a noise more like an attempt to crow. They also  take refuge in the timber for protection from the storms of winter.    During the hunting season they lie well to a dog and afford fine  shooting. The food of the sharp-tailed grouse consists of about ten  per cent insects, the balance being made up of seeds, grains and  berries, with a good percentage of \"brouse\" in the winter.    =Color=--Male--Side of head and throat, pale buff with mottlings of  brown on the cheeks; back and wings, gray, mottled with black;  breast, light buff. Under parts, white with lines of dark brown;  central tail feathers long and pointed; no long feathers on the neck.    Female--Resembles the male with the exception that the tail feathers  are not so long.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is a rude affair on the ground, lined with a  little dead grass and generally contains from ten to fifteen eggs of a  greenish buff speckled with fine dots of brown.    =Measurements=--Total length from 14 to 16 inches, with the wing about  eight; the central tail feathers are about five inches in length. The  average bird will weigh about two pounds.            Order ANSERES      Family, ANATIDAE                                                               Range.

THE WATERFOWL      The great variety of the waterfowl of the Pacific Coast, the wonderful  numbers in which they are found and the excellent shooting they  afford, forms a subject, which, to do it justice, would require the  space of an ordinary volume.    With the exception of the Gulf tier of the Southern states, waterfowl  on the Atlantic Coast are but birds of passage, tarrying for a time on  their way to milder winter quarters; tourists loitering for a day or  two at attractive by-stations as they wing their way south in the fall  and again on their return north in the spring. They are leaving the  isolation of the far north or the mountain lakes and marshes where  they spent the summer rearing their young and they are seeking more  favorable feeding grounds in the milder climate of the South, where  animal and vegetable life is not in the state of hibernation which  prevents it from furnishing them with an abundance of food during  their southern sojourn.    Over the larger portion of our hunting grounds what is the beginning  of the calendar year is in fact the beginning of our spring. When the  frost king lays his hand upon all vegetable and insect life in the  East, spreading his white shroud over field and pasture and breaking  with his icy sleet from the vine and the brush their clinging leaves;  when from the trees have fallen the last vestige of their autumnal  crowns of gold and crimson; when the last flower has shed its petals;  when the last hum of insect is heard and the last song of bird has  died away on the southern horizon--'tis then the early rains of the  Coast start the new sown grain in the fields, give life again to the  grasses of the plains, carpet the foothills and the valleys with the  gold and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38077"],[0,"British Birds in Their Haunts (#8)"],[1,"has taught it to pour forth its  melody at a time of the year when the bleak winds of winter roar  through the leafless trees'. The song of the Mistle Thrush is loud,  wild, and musical, Waterton calls it 'plaintive', Knapp 'harsh and  untuneful'. I must confess that I agree with neither. This note,  generally the earliest of the Spring sounds (for the Redbreast's song  belongs essentially to winter), is to my ear full of cheerful promise  amounting to confidence--a song of exultation in the return of genial  weather. The bird sings generally perched on the topmost branch of  some lofty tree, and there he remains for hours together out-whistling  the wind and heeding not the pelting rain. This song, however, is not  continuous, but broken into passages of a few notes each, by which  characteristic it may be distinguished alike from that of the Thrush  or the Blackbird, even when mellowed by distance to resemble either.  The Mistletoe Thrush is essentially a tree-loving bird. During winter  its food mainly consists of berries, among which those of the Mountain  Ash and Yew have the preference, though it also feeds on those of the  Hawthorn, Ivy, Juniper, and the strange plant from which it derives  its name.[1] Towards other birds it is a very tyrant, selfish and  domineering in the extreme; to such a degree, indeed, that even when  it has appeased its appetite it will allow no other bird to approach  the tree which it has appropriated for its feeding ground. I have seen  it take possession of a Yew-tree laden with berries, and most  mercilessly drive away, with angry vociferations and yet more  formidable buffets, every other bird that dared to come near. Day  after day it returned, until the tree was stripped of every berry,  when it withdrew and appeared no more.    As soon as the unfrozen earth is penetrable by its beak, it adds to  its diet such worms and grubs as it can discover; and, if it be not  belied, it is given to plunder the nests of other birds of their eggs  and young. It may be on this account that Magpies, Jays, and other  large woodland birds, robbers themselves, entertain an instinctive  dislike towards it. Certainly these birds are its better enemies; but  in the breeding season it eludes their animosity by quitting the  woods, and resorting to the haunts of man. Its harsh screech is now  rarely heard, for its present object is not defiance, but immunity  from danger. Yet it takes no extraordinary pains to conceal its nest.  On the contrary, it usually places this where there is little or no  foliage to shadow it, in a fork between two large boughs of an apple,  pear, or cherry tree, sometimes only a few feet from the ground, and  sometimes twenty feet or more. The nest is a massive structure,  consisting of an external basket-work of twigs, roots, and lichens,  within which is a kind of bowl of mud containing a final lining of  grass and roots. The bird is an early builder. It generally lays five  eggs and feeds its young on snails, worms, and insects. The range of  the Mistle Thrush extends as far as the Himalayas. In Great Britain it  is a resident species.       [1] That this thrush feeds on the berries of the mistletoe was         stated by Yarrell, but it is not now generally believed to         be a fact.       [Illustration:       Missel Thrush Song Thrush          Redwing       Fieldfare          [_face p. 2_]]       [Illustration:       Blackbird [M] _imm._          Blackbird [F] [M]               Ring Ouzel [M] [F]]        THE SONG THRUSH     TURDUS MAsSICUS        Upper parts brown tinged with olive; wing-coverts edged and      tipped with reddish yellow; cere yellowish; throat white in      the middle, without spots; sides of neck and breast reddish      yellow with triangular dark brown spots; abdomen and flanks      pure white with oval dark brown spots; under wing-coverts pale      orange yellow; bill and feet greyish brown. Length, eight      inches and a half, breadth thirteen inches. Eggs blue with a      few black spots mostly at the larger end.    The Thrush holds a distinguished place among British birds, as  contributing, perhaps, more than any other to the aggregate charms of  a country life. However near it may be, its song is never harsh, and  heard at a distance its only defect is, that it is not nearer. It  possesses, too, the charm of harmonizing with all other pleasant  natural sounds. If to these recommendations we add that the Thrush  frequents all parts of England, and resorts to the suburban garden as  well as the forest and rocky glen, we think we may justly claim for it  the distinction among birds, of being the last that we would willingly  part with, not even excepting its allowed master in song himself, the  Nightingale. Three notes are often repeated: Did he do it? Shut the  gate, Kubelik.    The food of the Thrush during winter consists of worms, insects, and  snails. The first of these it picks up or draws out from their holes,  in meadows and lawns; the others it hunts for among moss and stones,  in woods and hedges, swallowing the smaller ones whole, and extracting  the edible parts of large snails by dashing them with much adroitness  against a stone. When it has once discovered a stone adapted to its  purpose, it returns to it again and again, so that it is not uncommon  in one's winter walks to come upon a place thickly strewn with broken  shells, all, most probably, the 'chips' of one workman. As spring  advances, it adds caterpillars to its bill of fare, and as the summer  fruits ripen, it attacks them all in succession; strawberries,  gooseberries, currants, raspberries, cherries, and, on the Continent,  grapes suit its palate right well; and, when these are gone, pears and  apples, whether attached to the tree or lying on the ground, bear, too  often for the gardener, the marks of its beak on their ripest side.  During all this period it relieves the monotony of its diet by an  occasional repast on animal food; as, indeed, in winter it alternates  its food whenever opportunity occurs, by regaling itself on wild  berries. Yet, despite the mischief which it perpetrates in our gardens  by devouring and spoiling much of the choicest fruit--for your thrush  is an epicure, and tastes none but the ripest and best--the service  which it renders as a devourer of insects more than compensates for  all. So the gardener, if a wise man, will prefer the scare-crow to the  gun, the protecting net to that which captures.    I know two adjoining estates in Yorkshire. On one the gardener shoots  blackbirds and thrushes in fruit time. On the other they are  protected. The latter yields always more fruit than the former.    The Thrush holds a high rank, too, among birds as an architect. Its  nest is usually placed in a thorn-bush, a larch or young fir-tree, a  furze-bush, an apple or pear tree, or an ordinary hedge, at no great  elevation from the ground, and not concealed with much attempt at art.  Indeed, as it begins to build very early, it is only when it selects  an evergreen that it has much chance of effectually hiding its  retreat. The nest externally is composed of feather-moss, intermatted  with bents, twigs, and small roots, and terminates above in a thicker  rim of the same materials. Thus far the bird has displayed her skill  as basket-maker. The outer case is succeeded by a layer of cow-dung,  applied in small pellets, and cemented with saliva. The builder, with  a beak for her only trowel, has now completed the mason's work. But  she has yet to show her skill as a plasterer; this she does by lining  her cup-like chamber with stucco made from decayed wood, pulverized  and reduced to a proper consistence, kneading it with her beak. With  this for her sole instrument, except her round breast, to give to the  whole the requisite form, she has constructed a circular bowl  sufficiently compact to exclude air and water, as true and as finely  finished as if it had been moulded on a potter's wheel, or turned on a  lathe.    The Thrush lays four or five eggs, and rears several broods in the  season, building a new nest for each brood. During incubation the  female is very tame, and will suffer herself to be approached quite  closely without deserting her post. In the vicinity of houses, where  she is familiar with the human form, she will even take worms and  other food from the hand.        THE REDWING     TURDUS ILAACUS        Upper plumage olive brown; lore black and yellow; a broad      white streak above the eye; lower plumage white, with numerous      oblong dusky spots, middle of the abdomen without spots; under      wing-coverts and flanks bright orange red; bill dusky; feet      grey. Length eight inches, breadth thirteen inches. Eggs      greenish blue mottled with dark brownish red spots.    The Redwing (called in France _Mauvis_, whence an old name for the  Song-thrush, 'Mavis') is the smallest of the Thrushes with which we  are familiar. It is, like the Fieldfare, a bird of passage, reaching  us from the north about the same time with the Woodcock, in October.  It resembles the Song-thrush more than any other bird of the family,  but may readily be distinguished even at some distance by the light  stripe over the eye, and its bright red under wing-coverts. In some  parts of France it is much sought after by the fowler, its flesh  being considered by many superior to that of the Quail and Woodcock.  It owes perhaps some of this unfortunate distinction to the fact of  its arriving in France in time to fatten on grapes, for in this  country it is often too lean to be worth cooking. Being impatient of  cold, it is less abundant in the north of England than the south; but  even in the mild climates of Devon and Cornwall, where it congregates  in large numbers, it is so much enfeebled by unusually severe weather,  as to be liable to be hunted down by boys with sticks, and a Redwing  starved to death used to be no unfrequent sight in the"]]]
