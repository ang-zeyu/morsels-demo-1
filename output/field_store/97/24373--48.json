The great inequalities in  the richness of neighboring regions in the Milky Way show that the  hypothesis of uniform distribution does not apply to the equatorial  region. The claim has therefore been made that there is no proof of the  system extending out any farther in the equatorial than in the polar  direction.    The consideration of this objection requires a closer inquiry as to  what we are to understand by the form of our system. We have already  pointed out the impossibility of assigning any boundary beyond which we  can say that nothing exists. And even as regards a boundary of our  stellar system, it is impossible for us to assign any exact limit  beyond which no star is visible to us. The analogy of collections of  stars seen in various parts of the heavens leads us to suppose that  there may be no well-defined form to our system, but that, as we go out  farther and farther, we shall see occasional scattered stars to,  possibly, an indefinite distance. The truth probably is that, as in  ascending a mountain, we find the trees, which may be very dense at its  base, thin out gradually as we approach the summit, where there may be  few or none, so we might find the stars to thin out could we fly to the  distant regions of space. The practical question is whether, in such a  flight, we should find this sooner by going in the direction of the  axis of our system than by directing our course towards the Milky Way.  If a point is at length reached beyond which there are but few  scattered stars, such a point would, for us, mark the boundary of our  system. From this point of view the answer does not seem to admit of  doubt. If, going in every direction, we mark the point, if any, at  which the great mass of the stars are seen behind us, the totality of  all these points will lie on a surface of the general form that  Herschel supposed.    There is still another direct indication of the finitude of our stellar  system upon which we have not touched. If this system extended out  without limit in any direction whatever, it is shown by a geometric  process which it is not necessary to explain in the present connection,  but which is of the character of mathematical demonstration, that the  heavens would, in every direction where this was true, blaze with the  light of the noonday sun. This would be very different from the  blue-black sky which we actually see on a clear night, and which, with  a reservation that we shall consider hereafter, shows that, how far  so-ever our stellar system may extend, it is not infinite. Beyond this  negative conclusion the fact does not teach us much. Vast, indeed, is  the distance to which the system might extend without the sky appearing  much brighter than it is, and we must have recourse to other  considerations in seeking for indications of a boundary, or even of a  well-marked thinning out, of stars.    If, as was formerly supposed, the stars did not greatly differ in the  amount of light emitted by each, and if their diversity of apparent  magnitude were due principally to the greater distance of the fainter  stars, then the brightness of a star would enable us to form a more or  less approximate idea of its distance. But the accumulated researches  of the past seventy years show that the stars differ so enormously in  their actual luminosity that the apparent brightness of a star affords  us only a very imperfect indication of its distance. While, in the  general average, the brighter stars must be nearer to us than the  fainter ones, it by no means follows that a very bright star, even of  the first magnitude, is among the nearer to our system. Two stars are  worthy of especial mention in this connection, Canopus and Rigel. The  first is, with the single exception of Sirius, the brightest star in  the heavens. The other is a star of the first magnitude in the  southwest corner of Orion. The most long-continued and complete  measures of parallax yet made are those carried on by Gill, at the Cape  of Good Hope, on these two and some other bright stars. The results,  published in 1901, show that neither of these bodies has any parallax  that can be measured by the most refined instrumental means known to  astronomy. In other words, the distance of these stars is immeasurably  great. The actual amount of light emitted by each is certainly  thousands and probably tens of thousands of times that of the sun.    Notwithstanding the difficulties that surround the subject, we can at  least say something of the distance of a considerable number of the  stars. Two methods are available for our estimate--measures of parallax  and determination of proper motions.    The problem of stellar parallax, simple though it is in its conception,  is the most delicate and difficult of all which the practical  astronomer has to encounter. An idea of it may be gained by supposing a  minute object on a mountain-top, we know not how many miles away, to be  visible through a telescope. The observer is allowed to change the  position of his instrument by two inches, but no more. He is required  to determine the change in the direction of the object produced by this  minute displacement with accuracy enough to determine the distance of  the mountain. This is quite analogous to the determination of the  change in the direction in which we see a star as the earth, moving  through its vast circuit, passes from one extremity of its orbit to the  other. Representing this motion on such a scale that the distance of  our planet from the sun shall be one inch, we find that the nearest  star, on the same scale, will be more than four miles away, and  scarcely one out of a million will be at a less distance than ten  miles. It is only by the most wonderful perfection both in the  heliometer, the instrument principally used for these measures, and in  methods of observation, that any displacement at all can be seen even  among the nearest stars. The parallaxes of perhaps a hundred stars have  been determined, with greater or less precision, and a few hundred more  may be near enough for measurement. All the others are immeasurably  distant; and it is only by statistical methods based on their proper  motions and their probable near approach to equality in distribution  that any idea can be gained of their distances.    To form a conception of the stellar system, we must have a unit of  measure not only exceeding any terrestrial standard, but even any  distance in the solar system. For purely astronomical purposes the most  convenient unit is the distance corresponding to a parallax of 1\",  which is a little more than 200,000 times the sun's distance. But for  the purposes of all but the professional astronomer the most convenient  unit will be the light-year--that is, the distance through which light  would travel in one year. This is equal to the product of 186,000  miles, the distance travelled in one second, by 31,558,000, the number  of seconds in a year. The reader who chooses to do so may perform the  multiplication for himself. The product will amount to about 63,000  times the distance of the sun.    [Illustration with caption: A Typical Star Cluster--Centauri]    The nearest star whose distance we know, Alpha Centauri, is distant  from us more than four light-years. In all likelihood this is really  the nearest star, and it is not at all probable that any other star  lies within six light-years. Moreover, if we were transported to this  star the probability seems to be that the sun would now be the nearest  star to us. Flying to any other of the stars whose parallax has been  measured, we should probably find that the average of the six or eight  nearest stars around us ranges somewhere between five and seven  light-years. We may, in a certain sense, call eight light-years a  star-distance, meaning by this term the average of the nearest  distances from one star to the surrounding ones.    To put the result of measures of parallax into another form, let us  suppose, described around our sun as a centre, a system of concentric  spheres each of whose surfaces is at the distance of six light-years  outside the sphere next within it. The inner is at the distance of six  light-years around the sun. The surface of the second sphere will be  twelve light-years away, that of the third eighteen, etc. The volumes  of space within each of these spheres will be as the cubes of the  diameters. The most likely conclusion we can draw from measures of  parallax is that the first sphere will contain, beside the sun at its  centre, only Alpha Centauri. The second, twelve light-years away, will  probably contain, besides these two, six other stars, making eight in  all. The third may contain twenty-one more, making twenty-seven stars  within the third sphere, which is the cube of three. Within the fourth  would probably be found sixty-four stars, this being the cube of four,  and so on.    Beyond this no measures of parallax yet made will give us much  assistance. We can only infer that probably the same law holds for a  large number of spheres, though it is quite certain that it does not  hold indefinitely. For more light on the subject we must have recourse  to the proper motions. The latest words of astronomy on this subject  may be briefly summarized. As a rule, no star is at rest. Each is  moving through space with a speed which differs greatly with different  stars, but is nearly always swift, indeed, when measured by any  standard to which we are accustomed. Slow and halting, indeed, is that  star which does not make more than a mile a second. With two or three  exceptions, where the attraction of a companion comes in, the motion of  every star, so far as yet determined, takes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4069"],[0,"The Dawn of Canadian History : A Chronicle of Aboriginal Canada (#8)"],[1,"coast of Newfoundland is, indeed, for the most part, bold,  rugged, and inhospitable.    Leif put to sea once more. For two days the wind was from the  north-east. Then again they reached land. This new region was the  famous country which the Norsemen called Vineland, and of which every  schoolboy has read. There has been so much dispute as to whether  Vineland--this warm country where grapes grew wild--was Nova Scotia or  New England, or some other region, that it is worth while to read the  account of the Norse saga, literally translated:       They came to an island, which lay on the north side     of the land, where they disembarked to wait for good     weather. There was dew upon the grass; and having     accidentally got some of the dew upon their hands and     put it to their mouths, they thought that they had     never tasted anything so sweet. Then they went on     board and sailed into a sound that was between the     island and a point that went out northwards from the     land, and sailed westward past the point. There was     very shallow water and ebb tide, so that their ship     lay dry; and there was a long way between their ship     and the water. They were so desirous to get to the     land that they would not wait till their ship floated,     but ran to the land, to a place where a river comes     out of a lake. As soon as their ship was afloat they     took the boats, rowed to the ship, towed her up the     river, and from thence into the lake, where they cast     anchor, carried their beds out of the ship, and set     up their tents.       They resolved to put things in order for wintering     there, and they erected a large house. They did not     want for salmon, in both the river and the lake; and     they thought the salmon larger than any they had ever     seen before. The country appeared to them to be of so     good a kind that it would not be necessary to gather     fodder for the cattle for winter. There was no frost     in winter, and the grass was not much withered. Day     and night were more equal than in Greenland and     Iceland.    The chronicle goes on to tell how Leif and his men spent the winter in  this place. They explored the country round their encampment. They  found beautiful trees, trees big enough for use in building houses,  something vastly important to men from Greenland, where no trees grow.  Delighted with this, Leif and his men cut down some trees and loaded  their ship with the timber. One day a sailor, whose home had been in a  'south country,' where he had seen wine made from grapes, and who was  nicknamed the 'Turk,' found on the coast vines with grapes, growing  wild. He brought his companions to the spot, and they gathered grapes  sufficient to fill their ship's boat. It was on this account that Leif  called the country 'Vineland.' They found patches of supposed corn  which grew wild like the grapes and reseeded itself from year to year.  It is striking that the Norse chronicle should name these simple  things. Had it been a work of fancy, probably we should have heard, as  in the Chinese legends, of strange demons and other amazing creatures.  But we hear instead of the beautiful forest extending to the shore, the  mountains in the background, the tangled vines, and the bright patches  of wild grain of some kind ripening in the open glades-the very things  which caught the eye of Cartier when, five centuries later, he first  ascended the St Lawrence.    Where Vineland was we cannot tell. If the men really found wild grapes,  and not some kind of cranberry, Vineland must have been in the region  where grapes will grow. The vine grows as far north as Prince Edward  Island and Cape Breton, and, of course, is found in plenty on the  coasts of Nova Scotia and New England. The chronicle says that the  winter days were longer in Vineland than in Greenland, and names the  exact length of the shortest day. Unfortunately, however, the Norsemen  had no accurate system for measuring time; otherwise the length of the  shortest winter day would enable us to know at what exact spot Leif's  settlement was made.    Leif and his men stayed in Vineland all winter, and sailed home to  Greenland in the spring (1001 A.D.). As they brought timber, much  prized in the Greenland settlement, their voyage caused a great deal of  talk. Naturally others wished to rival Leif. In the next few years  several voyages to Vineland are briefly chronicled in the sagas.    First of all, Thorwald, Leif's brother, borrowed his ship, sailed away  to Vineland with thirty men, and spent two winters there. During his  first summer in Vineland, Thorwald sent some men in a boat westward  along the coast. They found a beautiful country with thick woods  reaching to the shore, and great stretches of white sand. They found a  kind of barn made of wood, and were startled by this first indication  of the presence of man. Thorwald had, indeed, startling adventures. In  a great storm his ship was wrecked on the coast, and he and his men had  to rebuild it. He selected for a settlement a point of land thickly  covered with forest. Before the men had built their houses they fell in  with some savages, whom they made prisoners. These savages had bows and  arrows, and used what the Norsemen called 'skin boats.' One of the  savages escaped and roused his tribe, and presently a great flock of  canoes came out of a large bay, surrounded the Viking ship, and  discharged a cloud of arrows. The Norsemen beat off the savages, but in  the fight Thorwald received a mortal wound. As he lay dying he told his  men to bury him there in Vineland, on the point where he had meant to  build his home. This was done. Thorwald's men remained there for the  winter. In the spring they returned to Greenland, with the sad news for  Leif of his brother's death.    Other voyages followed. A certain Thorfinn Karlsevne even tried to  found a permanent colony in Vineland. In the spring of 1007, he took  there a hundred and sixty men, some women, and many cattle. He and his  people remained in Vineland for nearly four years. They traded with the  savages, giving them cloth and trinkets for furs. Karlsevne's wife gave  birth there to a son, who was christened Snorre, and who was perhaps  the first white child born in America. The Vineland colony seems to  have prospered well enough, but unfortunately quarrels broke out  between the Norsemen and the savages, and so many of Karlsevne's people  were killed that the remainder were glad to sail back to Greenland.    The Norse chronicles contain a further story of how one of Karlsevne's  companions, Thorward, and his wife Freydis, who was a daughter of Eric  the Red, made a voyage to Vineland. This expedition ended in tragedy.  One night the Norsemen quarrelled in their winter quarters, there was a  tumult and a massacre. Freydis herself killed five women with an axe,  and the little colony was drenched in blood. The survivors returned to  Greenland, but were shunned by all from that hour.    After this story we have no detailed accounts of voyages to Vineland.  There are, however, references to it in Icelandic literature. There  does not seem any ground to believe that the Norsemen succeeded in  planting a lasting colony in Vineland. Some people have tried to claim  that certain ancient ruins on the New England coast--an old stone mill  at Newport, and so on--are evidences of such a settlement. But the  claim has no sufficient proof behind it.    On the whole, however, there seems every ground to conclude that again  and again the Norsemen landed on the Atlantic coast of America. We do  not know where they made their winter quarters, nor does this matter.  Very likely there were temporary settlements in both 'Markland,' with  its thick woods bordering on the sea, and in other less promising  regions. It should be added that some writers of authority refuse even  to admit that the Norsemen reached America. Others, like Nansen, the  famous Arctic explorer, while admitting the probability of the voyages,  believe that the sagas are merely a sort of folklore, such as may be  found in the primitive literature of all nations. On the other hand,  John Fiske, the American historian, who devoted much patient study to  the question, was convinced that what is now the Canadian coast, with,  probably, part of New England too, was discovered, visited, and  thoroughly well known by the Norse inhabitants of Greenland. For  several centuries they appear to have made summer voyages to and from  this 'Vineland the Good' as they called it, and to have brought back  timber and supplies not found in their own inhospitable country. It is  quite possible that further investigation may throw new light on the  Norse discoveries, and even that undeniable traces of the buildings or  implements of the settlers in Vineland may be found. Meanwhile the  subject, interesting though it is, remains shrouded in mystery.        CHAPTER V    THE BRISTOL VOYAGES    The discoveries of the Norsemen did not lead to the opening of America  to the nations of Europe. For this the time was not yet ripe. As yet  European nations were backward, not only in navigation, but in the  industries and commerce which supply the real motive for occupying new  lands. In the days of Eric the Red Europe was only beginning to emerge  from a dark period. The might and splendour of the Roman Empire had  vanished, and the great kingdoms which we know were still to rise.    All this changed in the five hundred years between the foundation of  the Greenland colony and the voyage of Christopher Columbus. The  discovery of America took place as a direct result of the advancing  civilization and growing power of Europe. The event itself was, in a  sense, due to pure accident. Columbus was seeking Asia when he found  himself among the tropical islands of the West Indies. In another  sense, however, the discovery marks in world history a necessary stage,  "]]]
