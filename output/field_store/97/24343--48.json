For a time the armor-clad fishes held undisputed sway;  then their reign was ended by the coming of the sharks, who in their  turn gave way to the fish-lizards, the Ichthyosaurs and Plesiosaurs.  These, however, were rather local in their rule; but the next group of  reptiles to appear on the scene, the great marine reptiles called  Mosasaurs, practically extended their empire around the world, from New  Zealand to North America.    We properly call these reptiles great, for so they were; but there are  degrees of greatness, and there is a universal tendency to think of the  animals that have become extinct as much greater than those of the  present day, to magnify the reptile that we never saw as well as the  fish that \"got away,\" and it may be safely said that the greatest of  animals will shrink before a two-foot rule. As a matter of fact, no  animals are known to have existed that were larger than the whales; and,  while there are now no reptiles that can compare in bulk with the  Dinosaurs, there were few Mosasaurs that exceeded in size a first-class  Crocodile. An occasional Mosasaur reaches a length of forty feet, but  such are rare indeed, and one even twenty-five feet long is a large  specimen,[4] while the great Mugger, or Man-eating Crocodile, grows, if  permitted, to a length of twenty-five or even thirty feet, and need not  be ashamed to match his bulk and jaws against those of most Mosasaurs.    [4] _It is surprising to find Professor Cope placing the length of the  Mosasaurs at 70, 80, or 100 feet, as there is not the slightest basis  for even the lowest of these figures. Professor Williston, the best  authority on the subject, states, in his volume on the \"Cretaceous  Reptiles of Kansas,\" that there is not in existence any specimen of a  Mosasaur indicating a greater length than 45 feet._    The first of these sea-reptiles to be discovered has passed into  history, and now reposes in the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, after  changing hands two or three times, the original owner being dispossessed  of his treasure by the subtleties of law, while the next holder was  deprived of the specimen by main force. Thus the story is told by M.  Faujas St. Fond, as rendered into English, in Mantell's \"Petrifactions  and their Teachings\": \"Some workmen, in blasting the rock in one of the  caverns of the interior of the mountain, perceived, to their  astonishment, the jaws of a large animal attached to the roof of the  chasm. The discovery was immediately made known to M. Hoffman, who  repaired to the spot, and for weeks presided over the arduous task of  separating the mass of stone containing these remains from the  surrounding rock. His labors were rewarded by the successful extrication  of the specimen, which he conveyed in triumph to his house. This  extraordinary discovery, however, soon became the subject of general  conversation, and excited so much interest that the canon of the  cathedral which stands on the mountain resolved to claim the fossil, in  right of being lord of the manor, and succeeded, after a long and  harassing lawsuit, in obtaining the precious relic. It remained for  years in his possession, and Hoffman died without regaining his  treasure. At length the French Revolution broke out, and the armies of  the Republic advanced to the gates of Maestricht. The town was  bombarded; but, at the suggestion of the committee of savans who  accompanied the French troops to select their share of the plunder, the  artillery was not suffered to play on that part of the city in which the  celebrated fossil was known to be preserved. In the meantime, the canon  of St. Peter's, shrewdly suspecting the reason why such peculiar favor  was shown to his residence, removed the specimen and concealed it in a  vault; but, when the city was taken, the French authorities compelled  him to give up his ill-gotten prize, which was immediately transmitted  to the Jardin des Plantes, at Paris, where it still forms one of the  most interesting objects in that magnificent collection.\" And there it  remains to this day.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--A Great Sea Lizard, _Tylosaurus Dyspelor_. _From  a drawing by J. M. Gleeson._]    The seas that rolled over western Kansas were the headquarters of the  Mosasaurs, and hundreds--aye, thousands--of specimens have been taken  from the chalk bluffs of that region, some of them in such a fine state  of preservation that we are not only well acquainted with their internal  structure, but with their outward appearance as well. They were  essentially swimming lizards--great, overgrown, and distant relatives of  the Monitors of Africa and Asia, especially adapted to a roving,  predatory life by their powerful tails and paddle-shaped feet. Their  cup-and-ball vertebrae indicate great flexibility of the body, their  sharp teeth denote ability to capture slippery prey, and the structure  of the lower jaw shows that they probably ate in a hurry and swallowed  their food entire, or bolted it in great chunks. The jaws of all  reptiles are made up of a number of pieces, but these are usually so  spliced together that each half of the jaw is one inflexible, or nearly  inflexible, mass of bone. In snakes, which swallow their prey entire,  the difficulty of swallowing animals greater in diameter than themselves  is surmounted by having the two halves of the lower jaw loosely joined  at the free ends, so that these may spread wide apart and thus increase  the gape of the mouth. This is also helped by the manner in which the  jaw is joined to the head. The pelican solves the problem by the length  of his mandibles, this allowing so much spring that when open they bow  apart to form a nice little landing net. In the Mosasaurs, as in the  cormorants, among birds, there is a sort of joint in each half of the  lower jaw which permits it to bow outward when opened, and this, aided  by the articulation of the jaw with the cranium, adds greatly to the  swallowing capacity. Thus in nature the same end is attained by very  different methods. To borrow a suggestion from Professor Cope, if the  reader will extend his arms at full length, the palms touching, and then  bend his elbows outward he will get a very good idea of the action of a  Mosasaur's jaw. The western sea was a lively place in the day of the  great Mosasaurs, for with them swam the king of turtles, Archelon, as  Mr. Wieland has fitly named him, a creature a dozen feet or more in  length, with a head a full yard long, while in the shallows prowled  great fishes with massive jaws and teeth like spikes.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Jaw of a Mosasaur, Showing the Joint that  Increased the Swallowing Capacity of that Reptile.]    There, too, was the great, toothed diver, Hesperornis (see page 83),  while over the waters flew pterodactyls, with a spread of wing of twenty  feet, largest of all flying creatures; and, not improbably--nay, very  probably--fish-eaters, too; and when each and all of these were seeking  their dinners, there were troublous times for the small fry in that old  Kansan sea.    And then there came a change; to the south, to the west, to the north,  the land was imperceptibly but surely rising, perhaps only an inch or  two in a century, but still rising, until \"The Ocean in which flourished  this abundant and vigorous life was at last completely inclosed on the  west by elevations of sea-bottom, so that it only communicated with the  Atlantic and Pacific at the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic Sea.\"    The continued elevation of both eastern and western shores contracted  its area, and when ridges of the sea-bottom reached the surface, forming  long, low bars, parts of the water-area were included, and connection  with salt-water prevented. Thus were the living beings imprisoned and  subjected to many new risks to life. The stronger could more readily  capture the weaker, while the fishes would gradually perish through the  constant freshening of the water. With the death of any considerable  class, the balance of food-supply would be lost, and many large species  would disappear from the scene. The most omnivorous and enduring would  longest resist the approach of starvation, but would finally yield to  inexorable fate--the last one caught by the shifting bottom among  shallow pools, from which his exhausted energies could not extricate  him.[5]    [5] _Cope: \"The Vertebrata of the Cretaceous Formations of the West,\" p.  50, being the \"Report of the United States Geological Survey of the  Territories,\" Vol. II._    Like the \"Fossil man\" the sea-serpent flourishes perennially in the  newspapers and, despite the fact that he is now mainly regarded as a  joke, there have been many attempts to habilitate this mythical monster  and place him on a foundation of firm fact. The most earnest of these  was that of M. Oudemans, who expressed his belief in the existence of  some rare and huge seal-like creature whose occasional appearance in  southern waters gave rise to the best authenticated reports of the  sea-serpent. Among other possibilities it has been suggested that some  animal believed to be extinct had really lived over to the present day.  Now there are a few waifs, spared from the wrecks of ancient faunas,  stranded on the shores of the present, such as the Australian Ceratodus  and the Gar Pikes of North America, and these and all other creatures  that could be mustered in were used as proofs to sustain this theory.  If, it was said, these animals have been spared, why not others? If a  fish of such ancient lineage as the Gar Pike is so common as to be a  nuisance, why may there not be a few Plesiosaurs or a Mosasaur "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3803"],[0,"File No. 113 (#8)"],[1,"fall, and stood up looking stronger than  ever; seizing the wrist of the detective, she held it as if her delicate  little hand were a vice, and cried out:    \"Explain yourself! what does all this mean? Do you know anything about  the contents of this note?\"    Although Fanferlot betrayed courage in daily contending with the most  dangerous rascals, he was positively terrified by Mme. Gypsy.    \"Alas!\" he murmured.    \"Prosper is to be arrested, accused of being a thief?\"    \"Yes, madame, he is accused of taking three hundred and fifty thousand  francs from the bank-safe.\"    \"It is false, infamous, absurd!\" she cried. She had dropped Fanferlot's  hand; and her fury, like that of a spoiled child, found vent in violent  actions. She tore her web-like handkerchief, and the magnificent lace on  her gown, to shreds.    \"Prosper steal!\" she cried; \"what a stupid idea! Why should he steal? Is  he not rich?\"    \"M. Bertomy is not rich, madame; he has nothing but his salary.\"    The answer seemed to confound Mme. Gypsy.    \"But,\" she insisted, \"I have always seen him have plenty of money; not  rich--then----\"    She dared not finish; but her eye met Fanferlot's, and they understood  each other.    Mme. Nina's look meant:    \"He committed this robbery in order to gratify my extravagant whims.\"    Fanferlot's glance answered:    \"Very likely, madame.\"    A few minutes' reflection convinced Nina that her first impression  was the correct one. Doubt fled after hovering for an instant over her  agitated mind.    \"No!\" she cried, \"I regret to say that Prosper would never have stolen  one cent for me. One can understand a man robbing a bank to obtain means  of bestowing pleasure and luxury upon the woman he loves; but Prosper  does not love me, he never has loved me.\"    \"Oh, fair lady!\" protested the gallant and insinuating Fanferlot, \"you  surely cannot mean what you say.\"    Her beautiful eyes filled with tears, as she sadly shook her head, and  said:    \"I mean exactly what I say. It is only too true. He is ready to gratify  my every wish, you may say; what does that prove? Nothing. I am too  well convinced that he does not love me. I know what love is. Once I was  beloved by an affectionate, true-hearted man; and my own sufferings of  the last year make me know how miserable I must have made him by my cold  return. Alas! we must suffer ourselves before we can feel for others.  No, I am nothing to Prosper; he would not care if--\"    \"But then, madame, why--\"    \"Ah, yes,\" interrupted Nina, \"why? you will be very wise if you can  answer me. For a year have I vainly sought an answer to this question,  so sad to me. I, a woman, cannot answer it; and I defy you to do so. You  cannot discover the thoughts of a man so thoroughly master of himself  that never is a single thought passing in his mind to be detected upon  his countenance. I have watched him as only a woman can watch the man  upon whom her fate depends, but it has always been in vain. He is kind  and indulgent; but he does not betray himself, never will he commit  himself. Ignorant people call him weak, yielding: I tell you that  fair-haired man is a rod of iron painted like a reed!\"    Carried away by the violence of her feelings, Mme. Nina betrayed her  inmost thoughts. She was without distrust, never suspecting that the  stranger listening to her was other than a friend of Prosper.    As for Fanferlot, he congratulated himself upon his success. No one but  a woman could have drawn him so excellent a portrait; in a moment of  excitement she had given him the most valuable information; he now  knew the nature of the man with whom he had to deal, which in an  investigation like that he was pursuing is the principal point.    \"You know that M. Bertomy gambles,\" he ventured to say, \"and gambling is  apt to lead a man--\"    Mme. Gypsy shrugged her shoulders, and interrupted him:    \"Yes, he plays,\" she said, \"but he is not a gambler. I have seen him  lose and gain large sums without betraying the slightest agitation. He  plays as he drinks, as he sups, as he falls in love--without passion,  without enthusiasm, without pleasure. Sometimes he frightens me; he  seems to drag about a body without a soul. Ah, I am not happy! Never  have I been able to overcome his indifference, and indifference so  great, so reckless, that I often think it must be despair; nothing will  convince me that he has not some terrible secret, some great misfortune  weighing upon his mind, and making life a burden.\"    \"Then he has never spoken to you of his past?\"    \"Why should he tell me? Did you not hear me? I tell you he does not love  me!\"    Mme. Nina was overcome by thoughts of the past, and tears silently  coursed down her cheeks.    But her despair was only momentary. She started up, and, her eyes  sparkling with generous resolution, she cried out:    \"But I love him, and I will save him! I will see his chief, the  miserable wretch who dares to accuse him. I will haunt the judges, and  I will prove that he is innocent. Come, monsieur, let us start, and I  promise you that before sunset he shall be free, or I shall be in prison  with him.\"    Mme. Gypsy's project was certainly laudable, and prompted by the noblest  sentiments; but unfortunately it was impracticable.    Moreover, it would be going counter to the plans of the detective.    Although he had resolved to reserve to himself all the difficulties  as well as the benefits of this inquiry, Fanferlot saw clearly that  he could not conceal the existence of Mme. Nina from the judge of  instruction. She would necessarily be brought into the case, and sought  for. But he did not wish her to take any steps of her own accord. He  proposed to have her appear when and how he judged proper, so that he  might gain for himself the merit of having discovered her.    His first step was to endeavor to calm the young woman's excitement. He  thought it easy to prove to her that the least interference in favor of  Prosper would be a piece of folly.    \"What will you gain by acting thus, my dear madame?\" he asked. \"Nothing.  I can assure you that you have not the least chance of success. Remember  that you will seriously compromise yourself. Who knows if you will not  be suspected as M. Bertomy's accomplice?\"    But this alarming perspective, which had frightened Cavaillon into  foolishly giving up a letter which he might so easily have retained,  only stimulated Gypsy's enthusiasm. Man calculates, while woman follows  the inspirations of her heart. Our most devoted friend, if a man,  hesitates and draws back: if a woman, rushes undauntedly forward,  regardless of the danger.    \"What matters the risk?\" she exclaimed. \"I don't believe any danger  exists; but, if it does, so much the better: it will be all the more to  my credit. I am sure Prosper is innocent; but, if he should be guilty, I  wish to share the punishment which awaits him.\"    Mme. Gypsy's persistence was becoming alarming. She hastily drew around  her a cashmere shawl, and, putting on her hat, declared that she was  ready to walk from one end of Paris to the other, in search of the  judge.    \"Come, monsieur,\" she said with feverish impatience. \"Are you not coming  with me?\"    Fanferlot was perplexed. Happily he always had several strings to his  bow.    Personal considerations having no hold upon this impulsive nature, he  resolved to appeal to her interest in Prosper.    \"I am at your command, fair lady,\" he said; \"let us go if you desire  it; only permit me, while there is yet time, to say that we are very  probably going to do great injury to M. Bertomy.\"    \"In what way, if you please?\"    \"Because we are taking a step that he expressly forbade in his letter;  we are surprising him--giving him no warning.\"    Nina scornfully tossed her head, and replied:    \"There are some people who must be saved without warning, and against  their will. I know Prosper: he is just the man to let himself be  murdered without a struggle, without speaking a word--to give himself up  through sheer recklessness and despair.\"    \"Excuse me, madame,\" interrupted the detective: \"M. Bertomy has by  no means the appearance of a man who has given up in despair. On the  contrary, I think he has already laid his plan of defence. By showing  yourself, when he advised you to remain in concealment, you will be very  likely to make vain his most careful precautions.\"    Mme. Gypsy was silently weighing the value of Fanferlot's objections.  Finally she said:    \"I cannot remain here inactive, without attempting to contribute in  some way to his safety. Can you not understand that this floor burns my  feet?\"    Evidently, if she was not absolutely convinced, her resolution was  shaken. Fanferlot saw that he was gaining ground, and this certainty,  making him more at ease, gave weight to his eloquence.    \"You have it in your power, madame,\" he said, \"to render a great service  to the man you love.\"    \"In what way, monsieur, in what way?\"    \"Obey him, my child,\" said Fanferlot, in a paternal manner.    Mme. Gypsy evidently expected very different advice.    \"Obey,\" she murmured, \"obey!\"    \"It is your duty,\" said Fanferlot with grave dignity, \"it is your sacred  duty.\"    She still hesitated; and he took from the table Prosper's note, which  she had laid there, then continued:    \"What! M. Bertomy at the most trying moment, when he is about to be  arrested, stops to point out your line of conduct; and you would render  vain this wise precaution! What does he say to you? Let us read over  this note, which is like the testament of his liberty. He says, 'If you  love me, I entreat you, obey.' And you hesitate to obey. Then you do not  love him. Can you not understand, unhappy child, that M. Bertomy has his  reasons, terrible, imperious reasons, for your remaining in obscurity  for the present?\"    Fanferlot understood these reasons the moment he put his foot in the  sumptuous apartment of the Rue Chaptal; and, if "]]]
