The schoolmaster had been watching there all night.  How we  cheered as she sailed up the channel.\"    Captain Jim's eyes were shining.  They were looking at the Four Winds  Harbor of sixty years agone, with a battered old ship sailing through  the sunrise splendor.    \"And Persis Leigh was on board?\" asked Anne.    \"Yes--her and the captain's wife.  They'd had an awful passage--storm  after storm--and their provisions give out, too.  But there they were  at last.  When Persis Leigh stepped onto the old wharf John Selwyn took  her in his arms--and folks stopped cheering and begun to cry.  I cried  myself, though 'twas years, mind you, afore I'd admit it.  Ain't it  funny how ashamed boys are of tears?\"    \"Was Persis Leigh beautiful?\" asked Anne.    \"Well, I don't know that you'd call her beautiful  exactly--I--don't--know,\" said Captain Jim slowly.  \"Somehow, you never  got so far along as to wonder if she was handsome or not.  It jest  didn't matter.  There was something so sweet and winsome about her that  you had to love her, that was all.  But she was pleasant to look  at--big, clear, hazel eyes and heaps of glossy brown hair, and an  English skin.  John and her were married at our house that night at  early candle-lighting; everybody from far and near was there to see it  and we all brought them down here afterwards.  Mistress Selwyn lighted  the fire, and we went away and left them sitting here, jest as John had  seen in that vision of his.  A strange thing--a strange thing!  But  I've seen a turrible lot of strange things in my time.\"    Captain Jim shook his head sagely.    \"It's a dear story,\" said Anne, feeling that for once she had got  enough romance to satisfy her.  \"How long did they live here?\"    \"Fifteen years.  I ran off to sea soon after they were married, like  the young scalawag I was.  But every time I come back from a voyage I'd  head for here, even before I went home, and tell Mistress Selwyn all  about it.  Fifteen happy years!  They had a sort of talent for  happiness, them two.  Some folks are like that, if you've noticed.  They COULDN'T be unhappy for long, no matter what happened.  They  quarrelled once or twice, for they was both high-sperrited.  But  Mistress Selwyn says to me once, says she, laughing in that pretty way  of hers, 'I felt dreadful when John and I quarrelled, but underneath it  all I was very happy because I had such a nice husband to quarrel with  and make it up with.'  Then they moved to Charlottetown, and Ned  Russell bought this house and brought his bride here.  They were a gay  young pair, as I remember them.  Miss Elizabeth Russell was Alec's  sister.  She came to live with them a year or so later, and she was a  creature of mirth, too.  The walls of this house must be sorter SOAKED  with laughing and good times.  You're the third bride I've seen come  here, Mistress Blythe--and the handsomest.\"    Captain Jim contrived to give his sunflower compliment the delicacy of  a violet, and Anne wore it proudly.  She was looking her best that  night, with the bridal rose on her cheeks and the love-light in her  eyes; even gruff old Doctor Dave gave her an approving glance, and told  his wife, as they drove home together, that that red-headed wife of the  boy's was something of a beauty.    \"I must be getting back to the light,\" announced Captain Jim.  \"I've  enj'yed this evening something tremenjus.\"    \"You must come often to see us,\" said Anne.    \"I wonder if you'd give that invitation if you knew how likely I'll be  to accept it,\" Captain Jim remarked whimsically.    \"Which is another way of saying you wonder if I mean it,\" smiled Anne.  \"I do, 'cross my heart,' as we used to say at school.\"    \"Then I'll come.  You're likely to be pestered with me at any hour.  And I'll be proud to have you drop down and visit me now and then, too.  Gin'rally I haven't anyone to talk to but the First Mate, bless his  sociable heart.  He's a mighty good listener, and has forgot more'n any  MacAllister of them all ever knew, but he isn't much of a  conversationalist.  You're young and I'm old, but our souls are about  the same age, I reckon.  We both belong to the race that knows Joseph,  as Cornelia Bryant would say.\"    \"The race that knows Joseph?\" puzzled Anne.    \"Yes.  Cornelia divides all the folks in the world into two kinds--the  race that knows Joseph and the race that don't.  If a person sorter  sees eye to eye with you, and has pretty much the same ideas about  things, and the same taste in jokes--why, then he belongs to the race  that knows Joseph.\"    \"Oh, I understand,\" exclaimed Anne, light breaking in upon her.    \"It's what I used to call--and still call in quotation marks 'kindred  spirits.'\"    \"Jest so--jest so,\" agreed Captain Jim.  \"We're it, whatever IT is.  When you come in tonight, Mistress Blythe, I says to myself, says I,  'Yes, she's of the race that knows Joseph.'  And mighty glad I was, for  if it wasn't so we couldn't have had any real satisfaction in each  other's company.  The race that knows Joseph is the salt of the airth,  I reckon.\"    The moon had just risen when Anne and Gilbert went to the door with  their guests.  Four Winds Harbor was beginning to be a thing of dream  and glamour and enchantment--a spellbound haven where no tempest might  ever ravin.  The Lombardies down the lane, tall and sombre as the  priestly forms of some mystic band, were tipped with silver.    \"Always liked Lombardies,\" said Captain Jim, waving a long arm at them.  \"They're the trees of princesses.  They're out of fashion now.  Folks  complain that they die at the top and get ragged-looking.  So they  do--so they do, if you don't risk your neck every spring climbing up a  light ladder to trim them out.  I always did it for Miss Elizabeth, so  her Lombardies never got out-at-elbows.  She was especially fond of  them.  She liked their dignity and stand-offishness.  THEY don't hobnob  with every Tom, Dick and Harry.  If it's maples for company, Mistress  Blythe, it's Lombardies for society.\"    \"What a beautiful night,\" said Mrs. Doctor Dave, as she climbed into  the Doctor's buggy.    \"Most nights are beautiful,\" said Captain Jim.  \"But I 'low that  moonlight over Four Winds makes me sorter wonder what's left for  heaven.  The moon's a great friend of mine, Mistress Blythe.  I've  loved her ever since I can remember.  When I was a little chap of eight  I fell asleep in the garden one evening and wasn't missed.  I woke up  along in the night and I was most scared to death.  What shadows and  queer noises there was!  I dursn't move.  Jest crouched there quaking,  poor small mite.  Seemed 's if there weren't anyone in the world but  meself and it was mighty big.  Then all at once I saw the moon looking  down at me through the apple boughs, jest like an old friend.  I was  comforted right off.  Got up and walked to the house as brave as a  lion, looking at her.  Many's the night I've watched her from the deck  of my vessel, on seas far away from here.  Why don't you folks tell me  to take in the slack of my jaw and go home?\"    The laughter of the goodnights died away.  Anne and Gilbert walked hand  in hand around their garden.  The brook that ran across the corner  dimpled pellucidly in the shadows of the birches.  The poppies along  its banks were like shallow cups of moonlight.  Flowers that had been  planted by the hands of the schoolmaster's bride flung their sweetness  on the shadowy air, like the beauty and blessing of sacred yesterdays.  Anne paused in the gloom to gather a spray.    \"I love to smell flowers in the dark,\" she said.  \"You get hold of  their soul then.  Oh, Gilbert, this little house is all I've dreamed  it.  And I'm so glad that we are not the first who have kept bridal  tryst here!\"        CHAPTER 8    MISS CORNELIA BRYANT COMES TO CALL    That September was a month of golden mists and purple hazes at Four  Winds Harbor--a month of sun-steeped days and of nights that were  swimming in moonlight, or pulsating with stars.  No storm marred it, no  rough wind blew.  Anne and Gilbert put their nest in order, rambled on  the shores, sailed on the harbor, drove about Four Winds and the Glen,  or through the ferny, sequestered roads of the woods around the harbor  head; in short, had such a honeymoon as any lovers in the world might  have envied them.    \"If life were to stop short just now it would still have been richly  worth while, just for the sake of these past four weeks, wouldn't it?\"  said Anne.  \"I don't suppose we will ever have four such perfect weeks  again--but we've HAD them.  Everything--wind, weather, folks, house of  dreams--has conspired to make our honeymoon delightful.  There hasn't  even been a rainy day since we came here.\"    \"And we haven't quarrelled once,\" teased Gilbert.    \"Well, 'that's a pleasure all the greater for being deferred,'\" quoted  Anne.  \"I'm so glad we decided to spend our honeymoon here.  Our  memories of it will always belong here, in our house of dreams, instead  of being scattered about in strange places.\"    There was a certain tang of romance and adventure in the atmosphere of  their new home which Anne had never found in Avonlea.  There, although  she had lived in sight of the sea, it had not entered intimately into  her life.  In Four Winds it surrounded her and called to her  constantly.  From every window of her new home she saw some varying  aspect of it.  Its haunting murmur was ever in her ears.

Nebsecht laughed too, and said, \"Now I know why my clothes were so  heavy, and felt so intolerably hot at noon. While I get rid of my  superfluous clothing, will you go and ask the high-priest if I have  leave to quit the temple.\"    \"He commissioned me to send a leech to the paraschites, and added that  the girl was to be treated like a queen.\"    \"Ameni? and did he know that we have to do with a paraschites?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Then I shall begin to believe that broken limbs may be set with  vows-aye, vows! You know I cannot go alone to the sick, because my  leather tongue is unable to recite the sentences or to wring rich  offerings for the temple from the dying. Go, while I undress, to the  prophet Gagabu and beg him to send the pastophorus Teta, who usually  accompanies me.\"    \"I would seek a young assistant rather than that blind old man.\"    \"Not at all. I should be glad if he would stay at home, and only let his  tongue creep after me like an eel or a slug. Head and heart have nothing  to do with his wordy operations, and they go on like an ox treading out  corn.\"       [In Egypt, as in Palestine, beasts trod out the corn, as we learn     from many pictures in the catacombs, even in the remotest ages;     often with the addition of a weighted sledge, to the runners of     which rollers are attached. It is now called noreg.]    \"It is true,\" said Pentaur; \"just lately I saw the old man singing out  his litanies by a sick-bed, and all the time quietly counting the dates,  of which they had given him a whole sack-full.\"    \"He will be unwilling to go to the paraschites, who is poor, and he  would sooner seize the whole brood of scorpions yonder than take a piece  of bread from the hand of the unclean. Tell him to come and fetch me,  and drink some wine. There stands three days' allowance; in this hot  weather it dims my sight.    \"Does the paraschites live to the north or south of the Necropolis?\"    \"I think to the north. Paaker, the king's pioneer, will show you the  way.\"    \"He!\" exclaimed the student, laughing. \"What day in the calendar is  this, then?       [Calendars have been preserved, the completest is the papyrus     Sallier IV., which has been admirably treated by F. Chabas. Many     days are noted as lucky, unlucky, etc. In the temples many     Calendars of feasts have been found, the most perfect at Medinet     Abu, deciphered by Dumich.]    The child of a paraschites is to be tended like a princess, and a leech  have a noble to guide him, like the Pharaoh himself! I ought to have  kept on my three robes!\"    \"The night is warm,\" said Pentaur.    \"But Paaker has strange ways with him. Only the day before yesterday I  was called to a poor boy whose collar bone he had simply smashed with  his stick. If I had been the princess's horse I would rather have  trodden him down than a poor little girl.\"    \"So would I,\" said Pentaur laughing, and left the room to request The  second prophet Gagabu, who was also the head of the medical staff of the  House of Seti, to send the blind pastophorus       [The Pastophori were an order of priests to which the physicians     belonged.]    Teta, with his friend as singer of the litany.          CHAPTER IV.    Pentaur knew where to seek Gagabu, for he himself had been invited to  the banquet which the prophet had prepared in honor of two sages who had  lately come to the House of Seti from the university of Chennu.       [Chennu was situated on a bend of the Nile, not far from the Nubian     frontier; it is now called Gebel Silsilch; it was in very ancient     times the seat of a celebrated seminary.]    In an open court, surrounded by gaily-painted wooden pillars, and  lighted by many lamps, sat the feasting priests in two long rows on  comfortable armchairs. Before each stood a little table, and servants  were occupied in supplying them with the dishes and drinks, which were  laid out on a splendid table in the middle of the court. Joints of  gazelle,       [Gazelles were tamed for domestic animals: we find them in the     representations of the herds of the wealthy Egyptians and as     slaughtered for food. The banquet is described from the pictures of     feasts which have been found in the tombs.]    roast geese and ducks, meat pasties, artichokes, asparagus and other  vegetables, and various cakes and sweetmeats were carried to the guests,  and their beakers well-filled with the choice wines of which there was  never any lack in the lofts of the House of Seti.       [Cellars maintain the mean temperature of the climate, and in Egypt     are hot Wine was best preserved in shady and airy lofts.]    In the spaces between the guests stood servants with metal bowls, in  which they might wash their hands, and towels of fine linen.    When their hunger was appeased, the wine flowed more freely, and each  guest was decked with sweetly-smelling flowers, whose odor was supposed  to add to the vivacity of the conversation.    Many of the sharers in this feast wore long, snowwhite garments, and  were of the class of the Initiated into the mysteries of the faith, as  well as chiefs of the different orders of priests of the House of Seti.    The second prophet, Gagabu, who was to-day charged with the conduct of  the feast by Ameni--who on such occasions only showed himself for a few  minutes--was a short, stout man with a bald and almost spherical head.  His features were those of a man of advancing years, but well-formed,  and his smoothly-shaven, plump cheeks were well-rounded. His grey eyes  looked out cheerfully and observantly, but had a vivid sparkle when he  was excited and began to twitch his thick, sensual mouth.    Close by him stood the vacant, highly-ornamented chair of the  high-priest, and next to him sat the priests arrived from Chennu, two  tall, dark-colored old men. The remainder of the company was arranged in  the order of precedency, which they held in the priests' colleges, and  which bore no relation to their respective ages.    But strictly as the guests were divided with reference to their rank,  they mixed without distinction in the conversation.    \"We know how to value our call to Thebes,\" said the elder of the  strangers from Chennu, Tuauf, whose essays were frequently used in the  schools,--[Some of them are still in existence]--\"for while, on one  hand, it brings us into the neighborhood of the Pharaoh, where life,  happiness, and safety flourish, on the other it procures us the honor  of counting ourselves among your number; for, though the university of  Chennu in former times was so happy as to bring up many great men, whom  she could call her own, she can no longer compare with the House of  Seti. Even Heliopolis and Memphis are behind you; and if I, my humble  self, nevertheless venture boldly among you, it is because I ascribe  your success as much to the active influence of the Divinity in your  temple, which may promote my acquirements and achievements, as to your  great gifts and your industry, in which I will not be behind you. I have  already seen your high-priest Ameni--what a man! And who does not know  thy name, Gagabu, or thine, Meriapu?\"    \"And which of you,\" asked the other new-comer, \"may we greet as the  author of the most beautiful hymn to Amon, which was ever sung in the  land of the Sycamore? Which of you is Pentaur?\"    \"The empty chair yonder,\" answered Gagabu, pointing to a seat at the  lower end of the table, \"is his. He is the youngest of us all, but a  great future awaits him.\"    \"And his songs,\" added the elder of the strangers. \"Without doubt,\"  replied the chief of the haruspices,--[One of the orders of priests in  the Egyptian hierarchy]--an old man with a large grey curly head, that  seemed too heavy for his thin neck, which stretched forward--perhaps  from the habit of constantly watching for signs--while his prominent  eyes glowed with a fanatical gleam. \"Without doubt the Gods have granted  great gifts to our young friend, but it remains to be proved how he will  use them. I perceive a certain freedom of thought in the youth, which  pains me deeply. Although in his poems his flexible style certainly  follows the prescribed forms, his ideas transcend all tradition; and  even in the hymns intended for the ears of the people I find turns of  thought, which might well be called treason to the mysteries which only  a few months ago he swore to keep secret. For instance he says--and we  sing--and the laity hear--           \"One only art Thou, Thou Creator of beings;          And Thou only makest all that is created.    And again--            He is one only, Alone, without equal;          Dwelling alone in the holiest of holies.\"       [Hymn to Amon preserved in a papyrus roll at Bulaq, and deciphered     by Grehaut and L. Stern.]    Such passages as these ought not to be sung in public, at least in times  like ours, when new ideas come in upon us from abroad, like the swarms  of locusts from the East.\"    \"Spoken to my very soul!\" cried the treasurer of the temple, \"Ameni  initiated this boy too early into the mysteries.\"    \"In my opinion, and I am his teacher,\" said Gagabu, \"our brotherhood may  be proud of a member who adds so brilliantly to the fame of our temple.  The people hear the hymns without looking closely at the meaning of the  words. I never saw the congregation more devout, than when the beautiful  and deeply-felt song of praise was sung at the feast of the stairs.\"       [A particularly solemn festival in honor of Amon-Chem, held in the     temple of Medinet-Abu.]    \"Pentaur was always thy favorite,\" said the former speaker. \"Thou  wouldst not permit in any one else many things that are allowed to  him. His hymns are nevertheless to me and to many others a dangerous  performance; and canst thou dispute the fact that we have grounds for  grave anxiety, and that things happen and circumstances grow up around  us which hinder us, and at last"]]]
