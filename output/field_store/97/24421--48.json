Among the elements are several instances of remarkable similarity of  properties. Thus there is a strong resemblance between platinum and  iridium; bromine and iodine; iron, manganese, and magnesium; cobalt  and nickel; phosphorus and arsenic; but this resemblance consists  mainly in their forming isomorphous compounds in which these  elements exist in the same relative proportion. These compounds are  similar, because the atoms of which they are composed are arranged  in the same manner. The converse of this is also true: nitrate of  strontia becomes quite dissimilar to its common state if a certain  proportion of water is taken into its composition.    If we suppose selenium to be merely modified sulphur, and phosphorus  modified arsenic, how does it happen, we must inquire, that  sulphuric acid and selenic acid, phosphoric and arsenic acid,  respectively form compounds which it is impossible to distinguish by  their form and solubility? Were these merely isomeric, they ought to  exhibit properties quite dissimilar!    We have not, I believe, at present the remotest ground to suppose  that any one of those substances which chemists regard as elements  can be converted into another. Such a conversion, indeed, would  presuppose that the element was composed of two or more ingredients,  and was in fact not an element; and until the decomposition of these  bodies is accomplished, and their constituents discovered, all  pretensions to such conversions deserve no notice.    Dr. Brown of Edinburgh thought he had converted iron into rhodium,  and carbon or paracyanogen into silicon. His paper upon this subject  was published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,  and contained internal evidence, without a repetition of his  experiments, that he was totally unacquainted with the principles of  chemical analysis. But his experiments have been carefully repeated  by qualified persons, and they have completely proved his ignorance:  his rhodium is iron, and his silicon an impure incombustible coal.          LETTER VI      My dear Sir,    One of the most remarkable effects of the recent progress of science  is the alliance of chemistry with physiology, by which a new and  unexpected light has been thrown upon the vital processes of plants  and animals. We have now no longer any difficulty in understanding  the different actions of aliments, poisons, and remedial agents--we  have a clear conception of the causes of hunger, of the exact nature  of death; and we are not, as formerly, obliged to content ourselves  with a mere description of their symptoms. It is now ascertained  with positive certainty, that all the substances which constitute  the food of man must be divided into two great classes, one of which  serves for the nutrition and reproduction of the animal body, whilst  the other ministers to quite different purposes. Thus starch, gum,  sugar, beer, wine, spirits, &c., furnish no element capable of  entering into the composition of blood, muscular fibre, or any part  which is the seat of the vital principle. It must surely be  universally interesting to trace the great change our views have  undergone upon these subjects, as well as to become acquainted with  the researches from which our present knowledge is derived.    The primary conditions of the maintenance of animal life, are a  constant supply of certain matters, animal food, and of oxygen, in  the shape of atmospheric air. During every moment of life, oxygen is  absorbed from the atmosphere in the organs of respiration, and the  act of breathing cannot cease while life continues.    The observations of physiologists have demonstrated that the body of  an adult man supplied abundantly with food, neither increases nor  diminishes in weight during twenty-four hours, and yet the quantity  of oxygen absorbed into his system, in that period, is very  considerable. According to the experiments of Lavoisier, an adult  man takes into his system from the atmosphere, in one year, no less  than 746 pounds weight of oxygen; the calculations of Menzies make  the quantity amount even to 837 pounds; but we find his weight at  the end of the year either exactly the same or different one way or  the other by at most a few pounds. What, it may be asked, has become  of the enormous amount of oxygen thus introduced into the human  system in the course of one year? We can answer this question  satisfactorily. No part of the oxygen remains in the body, but is  given out again, combined with carbon and hydrogen. The carbon and  hydrogen of certain parts of the animal body combine with the oxygen  introduced through the lungs and skin, and pass off in the forms of  carbonic acid and vapour of water. At every expiration and every  moment of life, a certain amount of its elements are separated from  the animal organism, having entered into combination with the oxygen  of the atmosphere.    In order to obtain a basis for the approximate calculation, we may  assume, with Lavoisier and Seguin, that an adult man absorbs into  his system 32 1/2 ounces of oxygen daily,--that is, 46,037 cubic  inches = 15,661 grains, French weight; and further, that the weight  of the whole mass of his blood is 24 pounds, of which 80 per cent.  is water. Now, from the known composition of the blood, we know that  in order to convert its whole amount of carbon and hydrogen into  carbonic acid and water, 64.102 grains of oxygen are required. This  quantity will be taken into the system in four days and five hours.  Whether the oxygen enters into combination directly with the  elements of the blood, or with the carbon and hydrogen of other  parts of the body, it follows inevitably--the weight of the body  remaining unchanged and in a normal condition--that as much of these  elements as will suffice to supply 24 pounds of blood, must be taken  into the system in four days and five hours; and this necessary  amount is furnished by the food.    We have not, however, remained satisfied with mere approximation: we  have determined accurately, in certain cases, the quantity of carbon  taken daily in the food, and of that which passes out of the body in  the faeces and urine combined--that is, uncombined with oxygen; and  from these investigations it appears that an adult man taking  moderate exercise consumes 13.9 ounces of carbon, which pass off  through the skin and lungs as carbonic acid gas. [1]    It requires 37 ounces of oxygen to convert 13 9/10 of carbon into  carbonic acid. Again; according to the analysis of Boussingault,  (Annales de Chim. et de Phys., lxx. i. p.136), a horse consumes 79  1/10 ounces of carbon in twenty-four hours, a milch cow 70 3/4  ounces; so that the horse requires 13 pounds 3 1/2 ounces, and the  cow 11 pounds 10 3/4 ounces of oxygen. [2]    As no part of the oxygen taken into the system of an animal is given  off in any other form than combined with carbon or hydrogen, and as  in a normal condition, or state of health, the carbon and hydrogen  so given off are replaced by those elements in the food, it is  evident that the amount of nourishment required by an animal for its  support must be in a direct ratio with the quantity of oxygen taken  in to its system. Two animals which in equal times take up by means  of the lungs and skin unequal quantities of oxygen, consume an  amount of food unequal in the same ratio. The consumption of oxygen  in a given time may be expressed by the number of respirations; it  is, therefore, obvious that in the same animal the quantity of  nourishment required must vary with the force and number of  respirations. A child breathes quicker than an adult, and,  consequently, requires food more frequently and proportionably in  larger quantity, and bears hunger less easily. A bird deprived of  food dies on the third day, while a serpent, confined under a bell,  respires so slowly that the quantity of carbonic acid generated in  an hour can scarcely be observed, and it will live three months, or  longer, without food. The number of respirations is fewer in a state  of rest than during labour or exercise: the quantity of food  necessary in both cases must be in the same ratio. An excess of  food, a want of a due amount of respired oxygen, or of exercise, as  also great exercise (which obliges us to take an increased supply of  food), together with weak organs of digestion, are incompatible with  health.    But the quantity of oxygen received by an animal through the lungs  not only depends upon the number of respirations, but also upon the  temperature of the respired air. The size of the thorax of an animal  is unchangeable; we may therefore regard the volume of air which  enters at every inspiration as uniform. But its weight, and  consequently the amount of oxygen it contains, is not constant. Air  is expanded by heat, and contracted by cold--an equal volume of hot  and cold air contains, therefore, an unequal amount of oxygen. In  summer atmospheric air contains water in the form of vapour, it is  nearly deprived of it in winter; the volume of oxygen in the same  volume of air is smaller in summer than in winter. In summer and  winter, at the pole and at the equator, we inspire an equal volume  of air; the cold air is warmed during respiration and acquires the  temperature of the body. In order, therefore, to introduce into the  lungs a given amount of oxygen, less expenditure of force is  necessary in winter than in summer, and for the same expenditure of  force more oxygen is inspired in winter. It is also obvious that in  an equal number of respirations we consume more oxygen at the level  of the sea than on a mountain.    The oxygen taken into the system is given out again in the same  form, both in summer and winter: we expire more carbon at a low than  at a high temperature, and require more or less carbon in our food  in the same "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#8)"],[1,"enlisted for  time, but for eternity also, and did not wish to shrink now, although I  felt my incompetency.\"    Having received notice of his appointment, and instructions from the  Prophet to make his way to Far West as soon as possible, he appointed a  time to leave, and in the interim made a farewell visit to the branches  of the Church he had presided over, for the purpose of setting them in  order.    Some time previous to being called to the Apostleship, in connection  with a brother by the name of Henry Humphrey, Elder Taylor had  purchased a house and barn and five acres of land within a quarter of  a mile of the Kirtland Temple, where they had anticipated going into  business together as soon as he should be released from presiding in  Canada. This, with his expenses during nearly two years that he had  been preaching in Canada without remuneration, left him with very  little means. \"But,\" he writes, \"I put my trust in the Lord.\"    He told his wife to make preparations for leaving at a certain time.    \"But how are you going to perform a journey of thirteen or fourteen  hundred miles by land, and to a wilderness country without means?\"    \"I don't know; but the Lord will open out the way.\"    Everywhere he went, he told the Saints about the time he expected to  leave for Far West, but still no visible prospect of getting there was  yet in sight. Three or four days before the time appointed for his  departure, he called upon a Brother John Mills, who had previously  talked of going with him to Kirtland when the time came that he could  leave Canada. Elder Taylor now told him that he would have to give up  going to Kirtland as he had received word from the Prophet to go to Far  West.    \"Well, I'll go to Far West too,\" said Brother Mills, \"won't you go with  me, Brother Taylor, I have plenty of teams?\"    Elder Taylor.--\"Brother Mills, I have nothing to pay you with for  taking me.\"    Brother Mills.--\"That makes no difference.\"    Elder Taylor.--\"But I have no money to pay my expenses.\"    Brother Mills.--\"I have plenty, and it is at your service.\"    Elder Taylor.--\"That is very kind of you, but I object to getting into  debt without the prospect of being able to pay.\"    Brother Mills.--\"But you need not pay.\"    Elder Taylor.--\"Well, if you'll clear me of all responsibility in the  matter, and take the Lord for your paymaster, I'll go with you.\"    Brother Mills.--\"Oh, I am quite willing to agree to that.\"    And so it was arranged right then that they would travel together to  Far West. Before the day of their departure had come, the Saints sent  to Elder Taylor plenty of supplies, flour, cakes and hams; and as it  was the winter season, and such things would keep, they furnished  him enough roasted geese, ducks, and other cooked provisions to last  himself and several other families hundreds of miles on the journey.  Others sent him money and clothing, so that he had an abundance of  everything; and as Brother Mills had supplied the necessary conveyance  for the journey, it would appear that he had not trusted in the Lord in  vain.    They fitted up a covered sleigh for their families to ride in, while  their goods were conveyed in wagons. In this way they traveled to  Kirtland.    Footnotes    1. There is a revelation in the Doctrine & Covenants, Sec 118, that  was given at Far West, on the 8th of July, 1838, in which John Taylor,  John E. Page, Wilford Woodruff and Willard Richards, are called to the  Apostleship; and direction is given that they should be officially  notified of their appointment. But it is quite evident that Elder  Taylor was notified of his appointment previous to July 8th, 1838, as  he wound up his affairs and prepared to leave Canada, because of his  being informed of this call to the Apostleship in the fall of 1837.        CHAPTER VI.    JOURNEY TO FAR WEST VIA KIRTLAND--STATE OF AFFAIRS AT  KIRTLAND--DEFIANCE TO A MOB--EXPERIENCE AT DE WITT--MISSOURI  PERSECUTIONS--ORDAINED AN APOSTLE.    On arriving in Kirtland Elder Taylor found that the Presidency of the  Church and many of the Saints had removed to Far West, Missouri. This  alone was calculated to make a great alteration in the place, and  surround it with a spirit of loneliness. But other causes had also been  operating to bring about marked changes since his former visits to this  shrine.    Only a year or two before, everything in and about Kirtland had been  prosperous. The Saints abounded in everything their hearts could  desire. The men wore expensive raiment, ornamented with velvets and  silks of the richest and rarest quality. It may be taken for granted  that the sisters were not a whit behind them. They were arrayed in  their silks, satins, lace, veils and jewelry; and amid all their piety,  manifested a full share of vanity and pride.    Speculation was rife all over the United States at that time, and  the Saints did not escape the contagion. They started a banking  institution, engaged in mercantile pursuits and land speculation. For  a time they were prosperous and wealth rapidly accumulated among them.  Sidney Rigdon declared, in a burst of enthusiasm, that the glory of the  latter-days was now being ushered in, and that Zion would soon become  the glory of the whole earth; when the Lord for silver would bring  gold; for iron, brass; and for stones, iron. But a wave of financial  disaster swept over the entire country. Banking institutions went  down before it; thousands of merchants were hopelessly ruined; and in  the general disaster Kirtland did not escape. Like the inhabitants of  other towns her people were overwhelmed with financial embarrassment.  \"Distress, ruin and poverty,\" says Elder Taylor, \"seemed to prevail.  Apostates and corrupt men were prowling about as so many wolves seeking  whom they might devour. They were oppressive, cruel, heartless;  devising every pretext that the most satanic malignity could invent  to harass the Saints. Fraud, false accusation and false swearing,  vexatious law suits, personal violence, and bare-faced robbery  abounded. They were truly afflicted, persecuted and tormented.\"    As snow failed them at Kirtland Elder Taylor and company had to  abandon their sleigh and take to their wagons. The roads were so very  bad, however, that they had only gone some twenty or thirty miles  when they concluded it would be wise to stop until they should become  dryer. In the village where they stopped Elder Taylor took a job of  varnishing some furniture for a cabinet maker. While here he formed the  acquaintance of a number of infidels with whom he frequently conversed,  and they desired to hear him preach. He consented. They could not obtain  the use of the Methodist Church, though they had assisted to build it;  but nothing daunted, they cleared out and seated a cabinet maker's  shop, and here the Elder held forth.    He proved the Bible true, and then taught them its principles. He  proved the Book of Mormon true, and then preached from that. They were  highly delighted with his lectures; and when the time came that he had  to leave them, they deeply regretted his departure. One of the number  took him by the hand and said: \"Mr. Taylor, God bless you wherever you  go.\"    Among them was a gentleman to whom the Prophet Joseph had gone to  school. He spoke very highly of him as an exemplary, moral young man.  He had never investigated the evidences concerning the Book of Mormon;  but he knew the Prophet's character was misrepresented by pious frauds,  jealous of his influence and the spread of Mormonism.    Near Columbus, the capital of Ohio, they stayed at a town where a  number of brethren resided, and all were anxious to hear Elder Taylor  preach. As they had no hall, it was arranged that he should speak in  the open air.    A little before meeting time a number of the brethren came running to  the house where he was stopping with the information that the whole  town was gathering and that a number of men had proposed tar and  feathers, and boasted they would dress him with them if he undertook  to preach. The brethren advised him not to attempt it as they were not  strong enough to protect him. After a moment's reflection, however, he  decided to go and preach. The brethren remonstrated; they knew the tar  and feathers were prepared and that he could not escape. He replied  that he had made up his mind to go; they could go with him if they  chose, if not, he would go alone.    A very large concourse of people had assembled to listen to him. He  began his remarks by informing them that he had lately come from  Canada--a land under monarchical rule; that standing as he then did on  free soil, among free men, he experienced peculiar sensations.    \"Gentlemen, I now stand among men whose fathers fought for and obtained  one of the greatest blessings ever conferred upon the human family--the  right to think, to speak, to write; the right to say who shall govern  them, and the right to worship God according to the dictates of their  own consciences--all of them sacred, human rights, and now guaranteed  by the American Constitution. I see around me the sons of those noble  sires, who, rather than bow to the behests of a tyrant, pledged their  lives, fortunes and sacred honors to burst those fetters, enjoy freedom  themselves, bequeath it to their posterity, or die in the attempt.    \"They nobly fought and nobly conquered; and now the cap of liberty is  elevated on the tops of your liberty poles throughout the land, and  the flag of freedom waves from Wisconsin to Louisiana--from Maine to  Missouri. Not only so, but your vessels--foremost in the world--sail  over oceans, seas and bays; visiting every nation, and wherever those  vessels go your flag flutters in the breeze, a hope is inspired among  the down-trodden millions, that they, perchance, if they cannot find  liberty in their own land, may find it with you. * * * Gentlemen, with  you liberty is more than a name;"]]]
