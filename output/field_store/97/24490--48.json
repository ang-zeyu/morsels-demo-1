Besides I want  for the people to see I'm able to get about again, if I be a cripple.\"    Mrs. Tom perceived that Sabina meant to celebrate her recovery by a  triumphal return.  \"Well, my dear, I'll tell Leadville to send in the  cart for 'ee.\"    \"This 'ere thing do run so smooth as a die,\" said Sabina, returning to  her happy absorption in the trolly. \"You'd never believe 'ow easy I can  get about in it,\" and she began, with her strong, illness-whitened  hands, to turn the wheels.    \"Will it go uphill?\" said the other, after observing with interest the  paces of this new steed.    Sabina's face fell.  \"Lorrd bless me, I never thought o' that!\"    \"'Owever will you manage?\"  Only the shelf on which Wastralls--house,  yard and garden--stood, was flat.    \"I...\"  Sabina hesitated.  The brightness had died cut of her face.  \"I  don't know if Leadville will carry out my wishes or no.\"    \"Well, you can 'ardly expect 'un to.\"    \"I dun't see why 'e shouldn't.  'Tis my land, why shouldn't 'e do as I  want for'n to do?\"    \"'Cos 'e's so obstinate in 'is way as you are in yours.\"    \"My dear life, I bain't obstinate.  'Ow can 'ee say so?  I only do same  as my father and granfer did. I'm sure they wouldn't like for me to  alter it.\"    \"No, I don't 'spose they would,\" said Mrs. Tom, \"still...\"    Sabina was troubled, but not on account of Isolda's mistaken view of her  character.  That she had already forgotten.  \"Well, I've got th' old  George Biddick. I'm sure 'e'll do what I want for'n to do, if Leadville  won't.\"    \"Still that isn't like seein' for yerself.\"    \"I shall 'av to take the chance of that,\" but she did not seem happy  about it.  She mused with knit brow for some seconds, then changed the  subject.  \"Isolda, I'd like for Mrs. Bate to put my bed up in the big  room.\"    This--the old Justice Room--occupied one end of the house.  For many  years it had been used as a storeroom, but underneath dust and litter  lay evidence, in painted panelling and marble mantelpiece, of former  state.    \"'Tis a proper old lumber-shop,\" said Mrs. Tom, \"but that doesn't  matter.\"    \"You see,\" explained Sabina, \"I can't go overstairs.\"    \"I wonder 'ow Leadville'll like sleepin' on the ground floor?\"    \"Well, he must like it or lump it.\"  She spoke with the confidence of  one whose marriage had been a success. \"We'll get the room to rights for  yer.\"    \"And Isolda, I don't want to keep on Mrs. Bate, nor I don't want her  Jenifer nor her Janey.\"    \"'Ow'll 'ee manage then?\"    \"I want some one of my own flesh and blood.  I should love to 'av one of  your li'l maids.  Why couldn't I 'av Gray?  We've always 'greed like  chickens.\"    \"Well, I don't know I'm sure.\"  Mrs. Tom had been expecting this, she  had even schemed for it.  She had five daughters, pretty maidens all of  them, and Gray was the eldest.  What more suitable than that she should  fill a daughter's place at Wastralls?  Nevertheless it would not be wise  to jump at the offer.  \"She's young to go from 'ome.\"    \"Wastralls is only next door and she'll be all right with me.\"    \"An' 'as you've none of yer own,\" agreed Mrs. Tom, \"Gray's the nearest.\"    Whatever Sabina's intentions, however, she would not promise to make the  girl her heir.  \"'Twill be for the maid's good,\" she said vaguely.    \"I'll see what Tom got to say about it.\"  Gray was eighteen and, with  Richbell coming on, could well be spared.  No doubt Mrs. Constantine  Rosevear would think Wastralls ought eventually to go to one of her  sons; but, in this world, a hen scratched up what she could for her own  chicks.    \"Gray think more 'bout 'ome than Richbell,\" Sabina said thoughtfully.  \"She's not after the chaps so much.\"    The mother's pride was touched.  \"Whenever she go up round the parish,  there's always three or four pairs of eyes lookin' at Gray.  She can  always 'av a chap if she like, but she don't trouble whether she do or  no.\"    \"Is there any special young man, do 'ee think?\"    \"Well now, I don't care to say...\"    Sabina's curiosity was aroused.  \"Now Isolda, there's somethin' gone on  since I come in 'ere.  Who is it?\"    Mrs. Rosevear had spent some of the happiest hours of her life,  discussing her children with this trusty friend. \"No stranger,\" she said  smilingly.    \"Who then?\"    \"One of your 'inds.\"    The other opened her eyes.  \"My dear life, didn't she ought to be  lookin' for some one better off?\"    \"She don't think anything of money.\"    \"They don't at that age, we got to do that for'm. Who is it then?\"    \"Why, Jim Rosevear, the yard-man.\"    Mrs. Byron knitted her brows in an endeavour to recall the young man's  face.  \"Jim Rosevear?  He come just before my accident.  I can't think  who 'ee is.\"    \"Why, iss you do.  You know, Jack Rosevear of Treketh's son.\"    \"Jack Rosevear--th' old chap who's so contrary?\"    \"That's of'm.  When he get in a temper, you know, 'ee take off 'is 'at,  swing'n around, and fling'n down and stamp on it.\"    \"Oh iss, I know, I remember.\"  She meditated. \"That 'edn't as bad after  all.\"    \"No, 'tedn't bad, though 'ee've quarrelled with's father.  But Mrs.  Andrews over to Gentle Jane is 'is auntie and, as she's nobody of 'er  own and 'er man's dead, there's a farm there and Jim's nothing to do but  go in and 'ang up 'is 'at.\"    \"Then what's ah doin' at Wastralls?\"    Isolda smiled, that secret smile of the mother.  \"Well, you needn't ask  me that.  Ed'n Wastralls next door to Hember?\"    \"So that's it, is it?\"    \"There was heaps o' maidens after 'im, for 'e's a pretty boy and, at  Christmas Tree last New Year, 'e ad some mistletoe in's cap and they all  astin' for't; but Gray was the one 'e gived it to.  And that's 'ow 'e  come to you as yard-man.\"    \"And do she think anything 'bout 'im?\"    \"I believe she do, but she don't go round and tell everybody what she's  doin'.  She's so meek as a mouse.\"    \"Then tedn't known?\"    \"You're the first I've told anything to about it.\"    Sabina nodded.  \"Then if Gray comes to me, it'll hurry matters up?\"    \"Well, I'm very 'greeable for 'er to 'av 'im, 'cos I think 'e's a nice  boy.\"    \"And Gentle Jane is a nice farm and you've four other maidens?  Well, I  dunno as I shall want to lose 'er as soon as I get 'er, still we can  settle that by and by.\"                                        *CHAPTER IV*      A few days, spent in trundling herself about the ward, and Mrs. Byron  was ready for the long journey, over Big Hill and down to the sea.  Leadville, who saw in her return the extinction of his last hope, had  not the heart to come for her.    \"Pretty pickle I should look,\" he said to Mrs. Tom, \"drivin' missus 'ome  sittin' up in that trolly, showin' 'erself off like that.  Better fit  she should 'av Mr. Brenton's covered cart and cover 'erself up.  Any  one'd think she'd want to 'ide 'er affliction.\"    \"You fancy S'bina 'idin' of it?\" said Mrs. Tom, who had suggested his  going.  \"She'll be quite proud for people to see 'er goin' about with  'er poor old stumps. Leavin' out 'er laigs, you knaw, she's as strong as  ever.\"    When he frowned Byron's black brows came together in an ominous line.  \"Strong as ever?\" he said, \"that's different from what Dr. Derek told  me.  He give me no encouragement as she'll make old bones.\"    \"I wouldn't give much for that, then.  She'll be like a barley weed,  always dyin' and never dead.\"  She had been cleaning the house in  readiness for Mrs. Byron's return; and now, her labours ended, was  drinking a cup of tea with the master of it.  \"They old Rosevears was  long-livin' and they do say, she's more like Old Squire than either Tom  or Constantine be.  'Oo be 'ee gwine send in for 'er?\"    \"Jim can go in for 'er; there is two or three things wanted into  Shoppe\"--this was another hamlet in the widespread parish--\"and 'e can  bring 'em 'ome.\"    \"I'm sorry you bain't goin'.  You're the one ought to fetch 'er.\"    \"I've got a very poor 'eart for that sort of thing and this'll be worse  than Hobby-horse goin' to Traytor.\"    \"Iss,\" nodded Mrs. Tom.  \"I bet everybody'll turn out to give S'bina a  welcome 'ome.  After all, your ways bain't like our ways.\"    Leadville could not let that pass.  \"I might 'a 'bin born down east o'  Truro, still I can't tell you whether I was or no.  But I feel in my  bones an' veins that I'm no 'foreigner.'  Couldn't fancy this place as I  do if it wadn't so.\"    \"'Tis your misfortune,\" said Mrs. Tom, taking her cloak from the  door-peg, \"as you fancy it so.  If you was one of we, you'd act  different.\"    Mrs. Byron had a bright day for her journey, a day with but one cloud.  The staff of the hospital had gathered to see her start and when, on her  trolly, and followed by her luggage and a certain long wooden box, oddly  suggestive of a shortened coffin, she rolled herself down the hall and  into the roadway, they broke into a cheer. The gallant bearing of this  mutilated creature had drawn from them an emotional response.  The  beauty of it, the poignancy, touched them.  Men pressed forward to offer  their help and tears stood in the eyes of the women. That was the  spirit, this elemental courage, this defiance of unhappy fate.  Yes,  Sabina was indeed true descendant of Old Squire--he to whom men for so  long had given their respect.    In the road, drawn up and waiting, stood the farm wagon.  Jim Rosevear,  with a proper sense of the ceremonial nature of the occasion, had  plaited the horses' manes and tails with coloured worsteds.  The brass  harness twinkled in the sun and the cart-horses had been groomed until  their coats were nearly as bright. Sabina, occupied with her trolly,  which was showing a tendency to turn a little to the left, was not  immediately aware that the driver was not her husband.  Not indeed until  the trolly had been lifted to its place on the floor of the wagon and  secured by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#8)"],[1,"nt, gazed down at the little conclave that was concerned with  the misdeeds of his young descendant.    \"It is a difficult question,\" repeated Colonel Crayfield; he had said  the same thing already, several times.    \"Would you recommend another school?\" asked Augusta. \"Some stricter  establishment, perhaps, if one could be found, that would receive a girl  under the painful circumstances?\"    Colonel Crayfield halted beside a table. He picked up a long, narrow  scent-bottle, and appeared to examine it closely. Augusta hoped he would  not let it fall; the bottle had come from Delhi, was said to have been  the property of a Moghul princess, and once to have contained attar of  roses.    \"Well, on the whole, no,\" he said presently. \"We don't want to break  the child's spirit.\"    \"Spirit!\" echoed old Mrs. Carrington. \"She has the evil spirit of her  mother, not the spirit of her father's people, which I foolishly  imagined might have counteracted failings inherited from the other  side.\"    To Augusta's relief, Colonel Crayfield replaced the precious  scent-bottle, and addressed himself to the three ladies. \"If you will  pardon my plain speaking, I think you are making too much of this--this  indiscretion of Stella's. I had a talk with her this morning----\"    \"This morning?\" cried Augusta and Ellen together, and the three pairs of  eyes were fixed on him in amazed curiosity.    \"Yes; this morning, before breakfast,\" he confessed calmly, \"and my  opinion is that Stella meant no harm. She is growing up, is no longer a  child, and she needs more outlet. School is hardly the place for her  now.\"    \"But what would you suggest?\" came faintly from Ellen.    Mrs. Carrington shot a quick glance at him. She was recalling their  conversation on the terrace the previous afternoon; he had said, \"If I  were not a bachelor, and could offer her a chance in India----\" Then he  had strolled in the garden with Ellen, and had enjoyed Ellen's music  after dinner. Was it in his mind to seek the hand and the heart of her  younger daughter?    \"A plan has occurred to me,\" he continued, with caution; \"but I am not  at all sure--in fact, subject to your permission,\" he bowed slightly to  the trio, \"I should prefer to wait a little before saying anything  further.\"    Mrs. Carrington smiled, and at the moment she resembled a hawk more than  a sea-gull. With a gracious gesture of assent she rose. \"Augusta, my  dear,\" she said suavely, \"will you assist me upstairs? I feel rather  fatigued. This discussion has been trying, and I think\"--again she shot  a sharp glance at Colonel Crayfield--\"we may leave the solution of our  unhappy difficulty with every confidence to our poor dear Charles's old  friend.\"    Augusta dutifully supported her mother from the room; but, to Mrs.  Carrington's exasperation, the tiresome Ellen must needs come too,  instead of allowing Colonel Crayfield this obvious opportunity of paying  his addresses.    Therefore Colonel Crayfield found himself alone in the drawing-room, and  he was only too thankful for the relief. Now he could think connectedly.  In no way had he committed himself, so far, to any suggestion. Should he  ultimately decide that to marry the girl was too serious a step to take,  he could still advise something quite different from the idea that was  so strongly seductive.... He might suggest that Stella should be sent to  some Anglo-Indian friends of his own in London as a paying guest, he  being financially responsible; or he could offer to find some family in  India, when he returned there, who would be willing to take charge of a  girl as a matter of business, he, as her godfather, paying expenses. The  money was nothing.    As he roamed round the room, doubtful, undecided, his eyes fell on the  group of coloured clay models of Indian servants set out on a  papier-mâché bracket, and he paused, for they recalled the existence of  Sher Singh, his Hindu bearer, who for the past twenty-five years had  been his right hand and chief of his domestic staff, and who perhaps  knew more about Robert Crayfield than any other living being. Sher Singh  would not welcome a memsahib. At the same time, the fellow would hardly  be such a fool as to jeopardise his own valuable position by making  trouble; the almighty rupee would soon settle Sher Singh's objections,  and Stella must be made to understand that interference with the head  servant's authority in the household could not be permitted.... Thus the  Commissioner of Rassih endeavoured to exorcise the inopportune vision of  his confidential retainer, who, he was aware, bore a faint, fantastic  likeness to himself. People would sometimes remark, laughing, \"Like  master, like man.\"    He looked out of the window to see Stella crossing the lawn, a basket on  her arm; and he noted afresh the splendid promise of her young form, the  grace of her proportions, the perfection of feature and colouring. Truly  she was well worth a drastic upheaval of his mode of life, a price that  was hardly too high, all things considered. Involuntarily as he watched  her, he began to make plans for the future. The big bedroom that  overlooked the gardens at Rassih? No, it was not so cool in the hot  weather as the one he had hitherto occupied himself, which gave on to  the vast desert area at the back of the house. True, his present room  held tragic associations; his predecessor in the appointment had  committed suicide from the balcony, throwing himself over the parapet  down on to the rubbish and scrub far below, where in the night time  hyenas and jackals yelled and fought and made diabolical merriment....  And then there was the bathroom door, scarred with sabre cuts and bullet  holes, hideous reminders of a mutiny massacre where women and  children---- But that all belonged to the past. Stella need never be  told of such horrors, nor of the stories of footsteps, and cries, and  unaccountable noises--servants' superstitious nonsense that, of course,  he scoffed at and suppressed, though sometimes, when the heat kept him  awake at night, he had even imagined that he heard them himself.... The  drawing-room should be renovated; he had never used it; he would order a  piano from Calcutta.    Stella disappeared round the corner of the house, and Colonel Crayfield  realised with a sense of mingled triumph and incredulity that he had  actually made up his mind, that he had done with all hesitation. And  when Robert Crayfield once made up his mind he did not alter it.    A timid cough in the doorway disturbed his reflections. It was Ellen  Carrington, driven back to the drawing-room by her mother under pretext  that good manners did not permit of a guest being left solitary,  unentertained. She fluttered to a seat, prepared to make polite,  impersonal conversation; but Colonel Crayfield trampled on the  intention.    \"Well, and what do you think of it all, Miss Ellen?\" he inquired  confidentially; at any rate, she seemed to him the most human of the  three females. His tone gave her a nice little sense of importance.    \"I expect you are right. We may have taken things too seriously. But  Stella's conduct did seem very--rather----\"    He broke in abruptly. \"Can you keep a secret?\" And as his companion  looked up alarmed, he added, smiling, \"Only for a short time?\"    \"I--I hope I can.\" She had so little experience of secrets, and the very  word \"secret\" savoured of deceit!    \"Well, it's this. I intend to take Stella back with me to India. I  intend to marry her.\"    Ellen gasped. Totally unprepared as she was for such a disclosure, it  left her dumbfounded, also vaguely shocked. To her maidenly mind there  was something indelicate in the notion of _Stella_, who was little more  than a child, _married_, and to a man so very much her senior. Oh, dear!  In all her bewilderment Colonel Crayfield's voice sounded oddly distant.    \"I'm so--so surprised!\" she faltered.    \"I admit that she is young enough to be my daughter, but surely the  drawback goes for nothing if I am prepared to accept it. Consider the  advantage for Stella!\"    It was beyond Ellen's power to voice her feelings. She was only aware of  a nebulous resentment that she could not define even to herself, much  less aloud to the man who had caused it.    \"As my wife,\" he went on, glad to give utterance to his arguments, \"she  will have an assured position, she will be suitably provided for, _and_  she will be well looked after--I can promise you _that_!\"    The last sentence sounded to Ellen more like a threat than a promise.  Her silence puzzled Colonel Crayfield, annoyed him. He had anticipated  expressions of delight, of gratitude; he felt he had every reason to  expect them; yet this limp, bloodless old maid appeared totally  unimpressed by the benefits he proposed to shower upon her niece, seemed  even to disapprove of the whole business. He brushed from his mind the  impatience her odd behaviour had aroused.    \"I am in no doubt as to Stella's reception of my purpose,\" he could not  resist telling her, with pointed satisfaction; and had Miss Ellen been  capable of such vulgarity she would have sworn that she saw him lick his  lips.... She shrank, instinctively disgusted, and gathered up her  knitting with trembling hands.    \"Will you excuse me?\" she stammered; even her mother's orders could keep  her no longer in the room; she felt as if Colonel Crayfield had suddenly  turned into a sort of ogre. \"I--I have a letter to write that must catch  the post.\" And with this, one of the few lies she had ever told in her  life, she sidled past him to the door.    He looked after her in contemptuous wonderment; then stepped out of the  window in search of his future bride. Probably she was eating  gooseberries, and the kitchen garden had this advantage, that it was  not overlooked by windows, though it was hardly the spot he would have  chosen for love-making. But Stella was nowhere to be found, and  returning at last to"]]]
