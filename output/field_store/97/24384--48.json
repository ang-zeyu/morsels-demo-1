She  is first a maiden whom no public breath is to disturb in her virgin  calm; and afterwards a chaste wife, whose lover is as jealous of her  reputation as any husband could be. The youthful lover had begun by  propounding the riddle of his love so obscurely that even by his  fellow-poets it had been found insoluble, adepts though they themselves  were in the art of smothering a thought. Then, though all his longing is  for Beatrice, lest she become the subject of common talk he feigns that  he is in love first with one lady and then with another.[41] He even  pushes his deceit so far that she rebukes him for his fickleness to one  of his sham loves by denying him the customary salutation when they  meet--this salutation being the only sign of friendship she has ever  shown. It is already some few years since the first sonnet was written.  Now, in a ballad containing a more direct avowal of his love than he has  yet ventured on,[42] he protests that it was always Beatrice his heart  was busy with, and that to her, though his eyes may have seemed to  wander, his affection was always true. In the very next poem we find him  as if debating with himself whether he shall persevere. He weighs the  ennobling influence of a pure love and the sweetness it gives to life,  against the pains and self-denial to which it condemns its servant.  Here, he tells us in his commentary, he was like a traveller who has  come to where the ways divide. His only means of escape--and he feels it  is a poor one--is to throw himself into the arms of Pity.    From internal evidence it seems reasonably certain that the marriage of  Beatrice fell at the time when he describes himself as standing at the  parting of the ways. Before that he has been careful to write of his  love in terms so general as to be understood only by those in possession  of the key. Now he makes direct mention of her, and seeks to be in her  company; and he even leads us to infer that it was owing to his poems  that she became a well-known personage in the streets of Florence.  Immediately after the sonnet in which he has recourse to Pity, he tells  how he was led by a friend into the house of a lady, married only that  day, whom they find surrounded by her lady friends, met to celebrate her  home-coming after marriage. It was the fashion for young gentlemen to  offer their services at such a feast. On this occasion Dante for one can  give no help. A sudden trembling seizes him; he leans for support  against the painted wall of the chamber; then, lifting his eyes to see  if the ladies have remarked his plight, he is troubled at beholding  Beatrice among them, with a smile on her lips, as, leaning towards her,  they mock at her lover's weakness. To his friend, who, as he leads him  from the chamber, asks what ails him, he replies: 'My feet have reached  that point beyond which if they pass they can never return.' It was only  matrons that gathered round a bride at her home-coming; Beatrice was  therefore by this time a married woman. That she was but newly married  we may infer from Dante's confusion on finding her there.[43] His secret  has now been discovered, and he must either renounce his love, or, as he  is at length free to do, Beatrice being married, declare it openly, and  spend his life in loyal devotion to her as the mistress of his  imagination and of his heart.[44]    But how is he to pursue his devotion to her, and make use of his new  privilege of freer intercourse, when the very sight of her so unmans  him? He writes three sonnets explaining what may seem pusillanimity in  him, and resolves to write no more. Now comes the most fruitful episode  in the history. Questioned by a bevy of fair ladies what is the end of a  love like his, that cannot even face the object of its desire, he  answers that his happiness lies in the words by which he shows forth the  praises of his mistress. He has now discovered that his passion is its  own reward. In other words, he has succeeded in spiritualising his love;  although to a careless reader it might seem in little need of passing  through the process. Then, soon after, as he walks by a crystal brook,  he is inspired with the words which begin the noblest poem he had yet  produced,[45] and that as the author of which he is hailed by a  fellow-poet in Purgatory. It is the first to glorify Beatrice as one in  whom Heaven is more concerned than Earth; and in it, too, he anticipates  his journey through the other world. She dies,[46] and we are surprised  to find that within a year of her death he wavers in his allegiance to  her memory. A fair face, expressing a tender compassion, looks down on  him from a window as he goes nursing his great sorrow; and he loves the  owner of the face because she pities him. But seeing Beatrice in a  vision he is restored, and the closing sonnet tells how his whole desire  goes forth to her, and how his spirit is borne above the highest sphere  to behold her receiving honour, and shedding radiance on all around her.  The narrative closes with a reference to a vision which he does not  recount, but which incites him to severe study in order that he may  learn to write of her as she deserves. And the last sentence of the  _Vita Nuova_ expresses a hope--a hope which would be arrogant coming  after anything less perfect than the _Vita Nuova_--that, concerning her,  he shall yet say things never said before of any woman. Thus the poet's  earliest work contains an earnest of the latest, and his morning makes  one day with his evening.    The narrative of the _Vita Nuova_ is fluent and graceful, in this  contrasting strongly with the analytical arguments attached to the  various poems. Dante treats his readers as if they were able to catch  the meaning of the most recondite allegory, and yet were ignorant of the  alphabet of literary form. And, as is the case with other poets of the  time, the free movement of his fancy is often hampered by the necessity  he felt of expressing himself in the language of the popular scholastic  philosophy. All this is but to say that he was a man of his period, as  well as a great genius. And even in this his first work he bettered the  example of Guido Cavalcanti, Guido of Bologna, and the others whom he  found, but did not long suffer to remain, the masters of Italian  verse.[47] These inherited from the Provencal and Sicilian poets much  of the cant of which European poetry has been so slow to clear itself;  and chiefly that of presenting all human emotion and volition under the  figure of love for a mistress, who was often merely a creature of fancy,  set up to act as Queen of Beauty while the poet ran his intellectual  jousts. But Dante dealt in no feigned inspiration, and distinguishes  himself from the whole school of philosophical and artificial poets as  'one who can only speak as love inspires.'[48] He may deal in allegory  and utter sayings dark enough, but the first suggestions of his thoughts  are obtained from facts of emotion or of real life. His lady was no  creature of fancy, but his neighbour Beatrice Portinari: and she who  ends in the _Paradiso_ as the embodied beauty of holiness was, to begin  with, a fair Florentine girl.    The instance of Beatrice is the strongest, although others might be  adduced, to illustrate Dante's economy of actual experience; the skilful  use, that is, of real emotions and incidents to serve for suggestion and  material of poetical thought. As has been told, towards the close of the  _Vita Nuova_ he describes how he found a temporary consolation for the  loss of Beatrice in the pity of a fair and noble lady. In his next work,  the _Convito_, or _Banquet_, she appears as the personification of  philosophy. The plan of the _Convito_ is that of a commentary on odes  which are interpreted as having various meanings--among others the  literal as distinguished from the allegorical or essentially true. As  far as this lady is concerned, Dante shows some eagerness to pass from  the literal meaning; desirous, it may be, to correct the belief that he  had ever wavered in his exclusive devotion to Beatrice. That for a time  he did transfer his thoughts from Beatrice in Heaven to the fair lady of  the window is almost certain, and by the time he wrote the _Purgatorio_  he was able to make confession of such a fault. But at the earlier  period at which the _Convito_[49] was written, he may have come to  regard the avowal in the _Vita Nuova_ as an oversight dishonouring to  himself as well as to his first love, and so have slurred it over,  leaving the fact to stand enveloped in an allegory. At any rate, to his  gloss upon this passage in his life we are indebted for an interesting  account of how, at the age of twenty-seven, he put himself to school:--        'After losing the earliest joy of my life, I was so smitten with      sorrow that in nothing could I find any comfort. Yet after some      time my mind, eager to recover its tone, since nought that I or      others could do availed to restore me, directed itself to find how      people, being disconsolate, had been comforted. And so I took to      reading that little-known book by Boethius, by writing which he,      captive and in exile, had obtained relief. Next, hearing that Tully      as well had written a book in which, treating of friendship, he had      consoled the worthy Laelius on the occasion of the loss of his      friend Scipio, I read that too. And though at the first I found      their meaning hard, at last I comprehended it as far as my      knowledge of the language and some little command of mother-wit      enabled me to do: which same mother-wit had already helped me to      much, as may be seen by the _Vita Nuova_. And as it often happens      that a man goes seeking silver, and lights on gold he is not      looking for--the result of chance, or of some divine provision; so   "]]]
