(Foregoing combination of characters  distinguishing _S. cyanosticta_ from any other species in genus.)    _Description and Variation._--The largest males are from Piedras Negras,  El Peten, Guatemala, and they average 52.5 mm. in snout-vent length  whereas males from Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, average 50.6 mm. and those  from northern Oaxaca 50.3 mm. The smallest breeding male has a  snout-vent length of 44.6 mm. The average ratio of tibia length to  snout-vent length is 54.8 per cent in males from Piedras Negras,  and 56.4 and 56.3 per cent in males from Los Tuxtlas and Oaxaca,  respectively. The only other character showing noticeable geographic  variation is the size of the tympanum. The average ratio of the diameter  of the tympanum to the diameter of the eye is 76.3 per cent in males  from Piedras Negras, 71.8 from Oaxaca, and 66.9 from Los Tuxtlas.    The dorsal ground color of _Smilisca cyanosticta_ is pale green to tan  and the venter is creamy white. The dorsum is variously marked with dark  olive-green or dark brown spots or blotches (Pl. 6B). An interorbital  dark bar usually is present. The most extensive dark area is a V-shaped  mark in the occipital region with the anterior branches not reaching the  eyelids; this mark is continuous, by means of a narrow mid-dorsal mark,  with an inverted V-shaped mark in the sacral"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37839"],[0,"My Experiences in Manipur and the Naga Hills (#8)"],[1,"regarding them in hand, but it perished in the  insurrection of 1879. The probability is, that they came originally  from the south-eastern corner of Thibet.    Some of the Maories of New Zealand reminded me of the Angamis. The  well-defined nose is a prominent characteristic of the last,  as it is of some of the inhabitants of Polynesia. The people of  Samagudting--that is, the adults in 1874--told me that they had come  from the north-east, and were the seventh generation that had been  there. When they first occupied their village, the site was, they  said, covered with the bones and tusks of elephants which had come  there to die.    Had I lived longer among the Nagas, I should have liked to have made  deeper researches into their language and past history; as it was,  all my time was taken up with my active duties, and I had not a moment  to spare.    Their dress is a short kilt of black cotton cloth, ornamented, in  the case of warriors, with rows of cowrie shells. They have handsome  cloths of dark blue and yellow thrown over their shoulders in cold  weather. Their arms are spears and heavy short swords, called by the  Assamese name of dao; helmets and shields of wicker work (used chiefly  to cover the more vulnerable parts of the body) and sometimes clothed  with skins of tigers or bears. They have also tails of wood decorated  with goats' hair dyed red. The warspears are plain; the ornamental  ones are covered with goats' hair dyed red, and are sometimes used in  battle. Their drill is of a most complicated style, and requires much  practice. An Angami in full war paint is a very formidable-looking  individual. They are divided into many clans. Several clans often  inhabit one village, and it frequently happened that two clans thus  situated were at deadly feud with each other.    Blood feuds were common among all the hill-tribes, but the system  was carried to excess among the Angamis. Life for life was the rule,  and until each of the opposing parties had lost an equal number,  peace was impossible, and whenever members of one village met any  belonging to the other, hostilities were sure to result. Sometimes  an attempt was made to bring about a reconciliation, but then it  frequently happened that the number of slain to the credit of each  were unequal. Mozuma and Sephema might be at war, and Mozuma killed  five, whereas Sephema had killed only four. Sephema says, \"I must  kill one more to make the balance, then I will treat for peace,\"  so war continues. Some day Sephema has a chance, but kills two  instead of the one that was required; this gives her the advantage,  and Mozuma refuses to treat. So it goes on interminably. The position  of a small village at war with a large one, was often deplorable as  no one dared to leave the village except under a strong escort. I  once knew a case of some Sephema men at feud with Mozuma, hiring two  women of the powerful village of Konoma to escort them along the road  as thus accompanied no one dare touch them.    Once at Piphima, when my assistant Mr. Needham was encamped there,  parties from two hostile villages suddenly met each other and rushed  to arms. He was equal to the occasion and stopped the combat. I made  it a criminal offence to fight on our road called the \"Political Path,\"  and it was generally respected as neutral ground.    No Angami could assume the \"toga virilis,\" in this case the kilt  ornamented with cowrie shells, already described, until he had slain  an enemy, and in the more powerful villages no girl could marry a man  unless he was so decorated. The cowrie ornaments were taken off when  a man was mourning the death of a relation.    To kill a baby in arms, or a woman, was accounted a greater feat  than killing a man, as it implied having penetrated to the innermost  recesses of an enemy's country, whereas a man might be killed anywhere  by a successful ambush. I knew a man who had killed sixty women and  children, when on one occasion he happened to come upon them after  all the men had left the village on a hunting expedition.    Every Naga who was able to murder an enemy did so, and received great  commendation for it by all his friends. Later, when I was in Manipur,  I had a pleasant young fellow as interpreter. He often took my boys  out for a walk when he had nothing else to do, and was a careful,  trustworthy man. Once I asked him how many people he had killed (he  wore the cowrie kilt, a sure sign he had killed some one). A modest  blush suffused his face as if he did not like to boast of such a good  deed, and he mildly said, \"Two, a woman and a girl!\"    The Angamis when on friendly terms are an agreeable people to deal  with, polite, courteous, and hospitable. I never knew any one take  more pains or more successfully not to hurt the susceptibilities of  those they are talking to, indeed they show a tact and good feeling  worthy of imitation. My wife and I soon knew all the villagers well,  and often visited them, when we were always offered beer, and asked to  come into their verandahs and sit down, and just as we were leaving,  our host would search the hen's nests to give us a few eggs. The beer  we never took, but many Europeans like it and find it wholesome. It  is made of rice and has rather a sharp taste. Their houses are large  substantial structures built of wood and bamboo thatched with grass,  and the eaves come low down. Houses with any pretensions always  have verandahs. Besides the houses, there are granaries, often at  a distance for fear of fire. The Angamis bury their dead in and  about their villages, and for a time, decorate them with some of the  belongings of the deceased. Naturally they strongly object to the  graves being disturbed, and in making alterations I was careful not  to hurt their feelings.    The more powerful villages in the interior of the hills have a large  area of cultivation on terraces cut out of the hillside, and carefully  irrigated. Some of the terraces go up the hillsides to a great height,  and show considerable skill in their formation. On these terraces  lowland rice is grown and is very productive. Some of the smaller  outlying villages like Samagudting have only ordinary hill cultivation,  where upland rice is grown. The terrace land used to be greatly valued,  and was often sold at prices equal to L22 to L25 per acre!    The Angamis, in common with most hill-tribes that I have come across,  have a vague indefinite belief in a supreme being, but look on him as  too great and good to injure them. They believe themselves also to be  subject to the influence of evil spirits, whom it is their constant  endeavour to appease by sacrifices. Every misfortune is, as a rule,  ascribed to evil spirits, and much money is spent on appeasing them,  the usual way being to offer fowls, of which the head, feet, and  entrails are offered to the demon, with many incantations. The other  parts are eaten by the sacrificer.    All kinds of animals are readily eaten by the Angamis, and those dying  a natural death are not rejected. Dogs' flesh is highly esteemed. When  a man wants to have a delicate dish, he starves his dog for a day to  make him unusually voracious, and then cooks a huge dish of rice on  which he feeds the hungry beast. As soon as the dog has eaten his  fill, he is knocked on the head and roasted, cut up and divided,  and the rice being taken out, is considered the bonne bouche. The  Manipur dogs are regularly bred for sale to the hill-tribes, Nagas  included, and a portion of the bazaar, or market, used to be allotted  to them. I have seen a string of nineteen dogs being led away to be  strangled. Poor things, they seemed to realise that all was not well.    The Naga women are not handsome but very pleasant-looking, and  many of the girls are pretty, but soon age with the hard toil they  have to perform; working in the fields and carrying heavy loads up  endless hills. They have plenty of spirit and can generally hold  their own. They do not marry till they are nearly or quite grown  up. Divorce can be easily obtained when there is an equal division of  goods. Often a young man takes advantage of this, and marries a rich  old widow, and soon divorces her, receiving half her property, when he  is in a position to marry a nice young girl. The tribal name of the  Angami Nagas is \"Tengima.\" Naga is a name given by the inhabitants  of the plains, and in the Assamese language means \"naked.\" As some  of the Naga tribes are seen habitually in that state, the name was  arbitrarily applied to them all. It is the greatest mistake to connect  them with the snake worshippers, \"Nag Bungsees\" of India. Neither Nagas  or Manipuris, or any tribes on the eastern frontier, are addicted to  this worship, or have any traditions connected with it, and any snake,  cobra (Nag) or otherwise, would receive small mercy at their hands. The  slightest personal acquaintance with the Assamese and their language,  would have dispelled this myth for ever.    The Nagas are skilful iron-workers and turn out very handsome  spears. Their women weave substantial and pretty coloured cloths,  and every man knows enough of rough carpentering to enable him to  build his house, and make pestles and mortars for husking rice. They  make rough pottery, but without the potter's wheel.    After Ghumbeer Singh's Expedition, our next dealings with the Angamis  were in 1833, when Lieut. Gordon, adjutant of the Manipur Levy,  accompanied the Rajah of Manipur with a large force of Manipuris into  the Angami hills. On this occasion, Kohima and other villages were  subdued, as already stated, and an annual tribute exacted by Manipur.    So far as the British territories were concerned, Naga raids went  on as usual, but nothing was done till early in January 1839, when  Mr. Grange, sub-Assistant Commissioner of the Nowgong District,  was despatched with a detachment of the First Assam Sebundies (now  43rd Goorkha Light"]]]
