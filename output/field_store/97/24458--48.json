FASOLT          In truth it grieves me    Greatly the woman to lose;    And that my heart may forget her        Ye must heap the hoard,        Pile it so high        That it shall hide    The blossom-sweet maid from mine eyes!    WOTAN          Be Freia's form        The gauge of the gold.            [_Freia is placed in the middle by the two giants,          who then stick their staves into the ground in          front of her so that her height and breadth is          indicated._    FAFNER           Our staves give the measure         Of Freia's form;     Thus high now heap ye the hoard.    WOTAN          On with the work:        Irksome I find it!    LOGE          Help me, Froh!    FROH          I will end        Freia's dishonour.            [_Loge and Froh heap up the treasure hastily          between the staves._    FAFNER          Let the pile        Less loosely be built;        Firm and close        Pack ye the gauge!            [_He presses down the treasure with rude strength;          he bends down to look for gaps._          I still can see through;        Come, fill up the crannies!    LOGE          Hands off, rude fellow!        Touch nothing here!    FAFNER      Come here! This gap must be closed!    WOTAN [_Turning away angrily._          Deep in my breast        Burns the disgrace!    FRICKA          See how in shame    Beautiful Freia stands;        For release she asks,    Dumb, with sorrowful eyes.        Heartless man!    The lovely one owes this to thee!    FAFNER          Still more! Pile on still more.    DONNER          My patience fails;        Mad is the wrath    Roused by this insolent rogue!        Come hither, hound!        Measure must thou?    Thy strength then measure with mine!    FAFNER          Softly, Donner!        Roar where it serves;    Thy roar is impotent here.    DONNER [_Lunging out at him._          It will crush thee to thy cost, rogue.    WOTAN          Calm thyself!    Methinks that Freia is hid.    LOGE          The hoard is spent.    FAFNER            [_Measures the hoard carefully with his eye, and          looks to see if there are any crevices._      Still shines to me Holda's hair.        Yonder thing, too,        Throw on the hoard!    LOGE          Even the helm?    FAFNER          Make haste! Here with it!    WOTAN          Let it go also!    LOGE [_Throws the Tarnhelm on the heap._          At last we have finished.        Have ye enough now?    FASOLT          Freia, the fair,        Is hidden for aye!        The price has been paid.        Ah, have I lost her?            [_He goes up to the hoard and peers through it._          Sadly shine        Her eyes on me still,        Like stars they beam        Softly on me;        Still through this chink        I look on their light.            [_Beside himself._      While her sweet eyes I behold thus,    From the woman how can I part?    FAFNER          Hey! Come hither,        And stop me this cranny!    LOGE          Greedy grumblers!        Can ye not see    The gold is all gone?    FAFNER          Not the whole, friend!        On Wotan's finger    Shines a golden ring still;    Give that to close up the crevice!    WOTAN          What! Give my ring?    LOGE          Be ye counselled!        The Rhine-Maidens        Must have the gold;    Wotan will give them what theirs is.    [Illustration: Plate 14      FAFNER.      \"Hey! Come hither,       And stop me this cranny!\"]    WOTAN          What nonsense is this?    The ring I won so hardly,    Undismayed I hold and will keep.    LOGE          Broken then        Must be the promise    I gave the maidens who grieved.    WOTAN        By thy promise I am not bound;      As booty mine is the ring.    FAFNER          Not so. The ring    Must go with the ransom.    WOTAN      Boldly ask what ye will:        It shall be granted;        But not for all    The world would I give you the ring.    FASOLT [_Furious, pulls Freia from behind the hoard._          All is off!        The bargain stands:    Fair Freia ours is for ever!    FREIA        Help me! Help me!    FRICKA        Heartless God,      Grant it! Give way!    FROH        Keep not the gold back!    DONNER        Give them the ring too!    WOTAN        Let me alone!      I hold to the ring.            [_Fafner stops Fasolt as he is hastening off. All          stand dismayed; Wotan turns from them in anger. The          stage has grown dark again. From a cleft in the          rock on one side issues a bluish flame in which          Erda suddenly becomes visible, rising so that her          upper half is seen._    ERDA [_Stretching out a warning hand towards Wotan._      Yield it, Wotan! Yield it!    Flee the ring's dread curse!        Awful        And utter disaster    It will doom thee to.    WOTAN      What woman woe thus foretells?    ERDA      All things that were I know,        And things that are;        All things that shall be        I foresee.        The endless world's        Ur-Wala,    Erda, bids thee beware.        Ere the earth was,        Of my womb born        Were daughters three;        And my knowledge    Nightly the Norns tell to Wotan.        Now summoned by        Danger most dire,        I myself come.    Hearken! Hearken! Hearken!    All things will end shortly;        And for the Gods        Dark days are dawning!    Be counselled; keep not the ring!            [_Erda sinks slowly as far as the breast, while the          bluish light grows fainter._    WOTAN          A mystic might        Rang in thy words.    Tarry, and tell me further.    ERDA [_Disappearing._          Thou hast been warned;        Enough dost know;    Weigh my words with fear!            [_She vanishes completely._    [Illustration: Plate 15, \"Erda bids thee beware\"]    WOTAN      If thus doomed to foreboding--        I must detain thee        Till all is answered!            [_Wotan is about to follow Erda in order to detain          her. Froh and Fricka throw themselves in his way          and prevent him._    FRICKA        What meanest thou, madman?    FROH        Go not, Wotan!      Fear thou the warner,      Heed her words well!            [_Wotan gazes thoughtfully before him._    DONNER [_Turning to the giants with a resolute air._          Hark, ye giants!        Come back and wait still!    The gold we give you also.    FRICKA          Ah, dare I hope it?        Deem ye Holda    Worthy of such a price?            [_All look at Wotan in suspense; he, rousing          himself from deep thought, grasps his spear and          swings it in token of having come to a bold          decision._    WOTAN          To me, Freia,        For thou art free!        Bought back for aye,    Youth everlasting, return!    Here, giants, take ye the ring!            [He throws the ring on the hoard. The giants          release Freia; she hastens joyfully to the Gods,          who caress her in turns for a space, with every          manifestation of delight.    FASOLT [_To Fafner._          Hold there, greedy one!        Grant me my portion!        Honest division        Best for both is.    FAFNER      More on the maid than the gold    Thou wert set, love-sick fool,        And much against        Thy will the exchange was.        Sharing not, Freia    Thou wouldst have wooed for thy bride;        Sharing the gold,        It is but just    That the most of it should be mine.    FASOLT          Infamous thief!        Taunts? And to me!            [_To the Gods._      Come judge ye between us;        Halve ye the hoard        As seems to you just!            [_Wotan turns away in contempt._          Let him have the treasure;        Hold to what matters: the ring!    FASOLT            [_Falls upon Fafner, who has meanwhile been          steadily packing up the treasure._          Back, brazen rascal!        Mine is the ring.    I lost for it Freia's smile.            [_He snatches haply at the ring._          Off with thy hands!        The ring is mine.            [_There is a struggle. Fasolt tears the ring from          Fafner._    FASOLT          I hold it. It is mine now!    FAFNER          Hold fast, lest it should fall!            [_Lunging out with his stave, he fells Fasolt to          the ground with one blow; from the dying man he          then hastily tears the ring._          Now feast upon Freia's smile:        No more shalt thou touch the ring!            [_He puts the ring into the sack and tranquilly          continues to pack up the rest of the hoard. All the          Gods stand horrified. A solemn silence._    [Illustration: Plate 16, Fafner kills Fasolt.]    WOTAN          Dread indeed    I find is the curse's might.    LOGE          Unmatched, Wotan,        Surely thy luck is!        Great thy gain was        In getting the ring;        But the gain of its loss        Is gain greater still:        There thy foemen, see,        Slaughter thy foes    For the gold thou hast let go.    WOTAN      Dark forebodings oppress me!        Care and fear        Fetter my soul;        Erda must teach me,        Tell how to end them:        To her I must descend.    FRICKA [_Caressing and coaxing him._          Why linger, Wotan?        Beckon they not,        The stately walls,        Waiting to offer    Welcome kind to their lord?    WOTAN [_Gloomily._          With wage accurst        Paid was their cost.    DONNER [_Pointing to the background, which is still         enveloped in mist._          Heavily mists        Hang in the air;        Gloomy, wearisome        Is their weight!        The wan-visaged clouds    Charged with their storms I will gather,    And sweep the blue heavens clean.            [_Donner mounts a high rock on the edge of the          precipice, and swings his hammer; during what          follows the mists gather round him._      Hey da! Hey da! Hey do!        To me, O ye mists!        Ye vapours, to me!        Donner, your lord,        Summons his hosts!   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/485"],[0,"The Road to Oz (#8)"],[1," so much,\" Polychrome begged him; \"it  makes cold chills run down my back.\"    \"But I can't help it, my dear; my donkey head wants to bray  continually,\" he replied.  \"Doesn't your fox head want to yelp every  minute?\" he asked Button-Bright.    \"Don't know,\" said the boy, still staring at the shaggy man's ears.  These seemed to interest him greatly, and the sight also made him  forget his own fox head, which was a comfort.    \"What do you think, Polly?  Shall I promise the donkey king an  invitation to Ozma's party?\" asked Dorothy of the Rainbow's Daughter,  who was flitting about the room like a sunbeam because she could never  keep still.    \"Do as you please, dear,\" answered Polychrome.  \"He might help to amuse  the guests of the Princess.\"    \"Then, if you will give us some supper and a place to sleep to-night,  and let us get started on our journey early to-morrow morning,\" said  Dorothy to the King, \"I'll ask Ozma to invite you--if I happen to get  to Oz.\"    \"Good!  Hee-haw! Excellent!\" cried Kik-a-bray, much pleased.  \"You  shall all have fine suppers and good beds.  What food would you prefer,  a bran mash or ripe oats in the shell?\"    \"Neither one,\" replied Dorothy, promptly.    \"Perhaps plain hay, or some sweet juicy grass would suit you better,\"  suggested Kik-a-bray, musingly.    \"Is that all you have to eat?\" asked the girl.    \"What more do you desire?\"    \"Well, you see we're not donkeys,\" she explained, \"and so we're used to  other food.  The foxes gave us a nice supper in Foxville.\"    \"We'd like some dewdrops and mist-cakes,\" said Polychrome.    \"I'd prefer apples and a ham sandwich,\" declared the shaggy man, \"for  although I've a donkey head, I still have my own particular stomach.\"    \"I want pie,\" said Button-Bright.    \"I think some beefsteak and chocolate layer-cake would taste best,\"  said Dorothy.    \"Hee-haw!  I declare!\" exclaimed the King.  \"It seems each one of you  wants a different food.  How queer all living creatures are, except  donkeys!\"    \"And donkeys like you are queerest of all,\" laughed Polychrome.    \"Well,\" decided the King, \"I suppose my Magic Staff will produce the  things you crave; if you are lacking in good taste it is not my fault.\"    With this, he waved his staff with the jeweled ball, and before them  instantly appeared a tea-table, set with linen and pretty dishes, and  on the table were the very things each had wished for.  Dorothy's  beefsteak was smoking hot, and the shaggy man's apples were plump and  rosy-cheeked.  The King had not thought to provide chairs, so they all  stood in their places around the table and ate with good appetite,  being hungry.  The Rainbow's Daughter found three tiny dewdrops on a  crystal plate, and Button-Bright had a big slice of apple pie, which he  devoured eagerly.    Afterward the King called the brown donkey, which was his favorite  servant, and bade it lead his guests to the vacant house where they  were to pass the night.  It had only one room and no furniture except  beds of clean straw and a few mats of woven grasses; but our travelers  were contented with these simple things because they realized it was  the best the Donkey-King had to offer them.  As soon as it was dark  they lay down on the mats and slept comfortably until morning.    At daybreak there was a dreadful noise throughout the city.  Every  donkey in the place brayed.  When he heard this the shaggy man woke up  and called out \"Hee-haw!\" as loud as he could.    \"Stop that!\" said Button-Bright, in a cross voice.  Both Dorothy and  Polly looked at the shaggy man reproachfully.    \"I couldn't help it, my dears,\" he said, as if ashamed of his bray;  \"but I'll try not to do it again.\"    Of coursed they forgave him, for as he still had the Love Magnet in his  pocket they were all obliged to love him as much as ever.    They did not see the King again, but Kik-a-bray remembered them; for a  table appeared again in their room with the same food upon it as on the  night before.    \"Don't want pie for breakfus',\" said Button-Bright.    \"I'll give you some of my beefsteak,\" proposed Dorothy; \"there's plenty  for us all.\"    That suited the boy better, but the shaggy man said he was content with  his apples and sandwiches, although he ended the meal by eating  Button-Bright's pie.  Polly liked her dewdrops and mist-cakes better  than any other food, so they all enjoyed an excellent breakfast.  Toto  had the scraps left from the beefsteak, and he stood up nicely on his  hind legs while Dorothy fed them to him.    Breakfast ended, they passed through the village to the side opposite  that by which they had entered, the brown servant-donkey guiding them  through the maze of scattered houses.  There was the road again,  leading far away into the unknown country beyond.    \"King Kik-a-bray says you must not forget his invitation,\" said the  brown donkey, as they passed through the opening in the wall.    \"I shan't,\" promised Dorothy.    Perhaps no one ever beheld a more strangely assorted group than the one  which now walked along the road, through pretty green fields and past  groves of feathery pepper-trees and fragrant mimosa.  Polychrome, her  beautiful gauzy robes floating around her like a rainbow cloud, went  first, dancing back and forth and darting now here to pluck a  wild-flower or there to watch a beetle crawl across the path.  Toto ran  after her at times, barking joyously the while, only to become sober  again and trot along at Dorothy's heels.  The little Kansas girl walked  holding Button-Bright's hand clasped in her own, and the wee boy with  his fox head covered by the sailor hat presented an odd appearance.  Strangest of all, perhaps, was the shaggy man, with his shaggy donkey  head, who shuffled along in the rear with his hands thrust deep in his  big pockets.    None of the party was really unhappy.  All were straying in an unknown  land and had suffered more or less annoyance and discomfort; but they  realized they were having a fairy adventure in a fairy country, and  were much interested in finding out what would happen next.          8.  The Musicker      About the middle of the forenoon they began to go up a long hill.  By-and-by this hill suddenly dropped down into a pretty valley, where  the travelers saw, to their surprise, a small house standing by the  road-side.    It was the first house they had seen, and they hastened into the valley  to discover who lived there.  No one was in sight as they approached,  but when they began to get nearer the house they heard queer sounds  coming from it.  They could not make these out at first, but as they  became louder our friends thought they heard a sort of music like that  made by a wheezy hand-organ; the music fell upon their ears in this way:      Tiddle-widdle-iddle oom pom-pom!        Oom, pom-pom! oom, pom-pom!    Tiddle-tiddle-tiddle oom pom-pom!        Oom, pom-pom--pah!      \"What is it, a band or a mouth-organ?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Don't know,\" said Button-Bright.    \"Sounds to me like a played-out phonograph,\" said the shaggy man,  lifting his enormous ears to listen.    \"Oh, there just COULDN'T be a funnygraf in Fairyland!\" cried Dorothy.    \"It's rather pretty, isn't it?\" asked Polychrome, trying to dance to  the strains.      Tiddle-widdle-iddle, oom pom-pom,        Oom pom-pom; oom pom-pom!      came the music to their ears, more distinctly as they drew nearer the  house.  Presently, they saw a little fat man sitting on a bench before  the door.  He wore a red, braided jacket that reached to his waist, a  blue waistcoat, and white trousers with gold stripes down the sides.  On his bald head was perched a little, round, red cap held in place by  a rubber elastic underneath his chin.  His face was round, his eyes a  faded blue, and he wore white cotton gloves.  The man leaned on a stout  gold-headed cane, bending forward on his seat to watch his visitors  approach.    Singularly enough, the musical sounds they had heard seemed to come  from the inside of the fat man himself; for he was playing no  instrument nor was any to be seen near him.    They came up and stood in a row, staring at him, and he stared back  while the queer sounds came from him as before:      Tiddle-iddle-iddle, oom pom-pom,        Oom, pom-pom; oom pom-pom!    Tiddle-widdle-iddle, oom pom-pom,        Oom, pom-pom--pah!      \"Why, he's a reg'lar musicker!\" said Button-Bright.    \"What's a musicker?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Him!\" said the boy.    Hearing this, the fat man sat up a little stiffer than before, as if he  had received a compliment, and still came the sounds:      Tiddle-widdle-iddle, oom pom-pom,        Oom pom-pom, oom--      \"Stop it!\" cried the shaggy man, earnestly.  \"Stop that dreadful noise.\"    The fat man looked at him sadly and began his reply.  When he spoke the  music changed and the words seemed to accompany the notes.  He said--or  rather sang:      It isn't a noise that you hear,    But Music, harmonic and clear.        My breath makes me play        Like an organ, all day--    That bass note is in my left ear.      \"How funny!\" exclaimed Dorothy; \"he says his breath makes the music.\"    \"That's all nonsense,\" declared the shaggy man; but now the music began  again, and they all listened carefully.      My lungs are full of reeds like those    In organs, therefore I suppose,    If I breathe in or out my nose,        The reeds are bound to play.      So as I breathe to live, you know,    I squeeze out music as I go;    I'm very sorry this is so--        Forgive my piping, pray!      \"Poor man,\" said Polychrome; \"he can't help it.  What a great  misfortune it is!\"    \"Yes,\" replied the shaggy man; \"we are only obliged to hear this music  a short time, until we leave him and go away; but the poor fellow must  listen to himself as long as he lives, and that is enough to drive him  crazy.  Don't you think so?\"    \"Don't know,\" said Button-Bright.  Toto said, \"Bow-wow!\" and the others  laughed.    \""]]]
