True epilepsy is not compatible with      extraordinary intellectual endowments. Caesar, Napoleon, Peter the      Great, and other geniuses may have had some symptomatic fits, but      not idiopathic epilepsy.\" [B]    [Footnote B: Chas. L. Dana, A. M. M. D., Text Book of Nervous Diseases,  3rd edition, p. 408.]    There is much glamor of sophistry, which may be taken for profound  reason and argument, in the work to which I am calling your attention.  But one word answers this \"philosophical\" accounting for our Prophet.  The work accomplished by him, the institutions he founded, destroy  the whole fabric of premises and argument on which this theory is  based. Great as was the Prophet Joseph Smith--and he was great; to him  more than to any other man of modern times was it given to look deep  into the things that are; to comprehend the heavens and the laws that  obtain there; to understand the earth, its history, and its mission. He  looked into the deep things of God--always, be it remembered, by the  inspiration of God--and out of the rich treasure of divine knowledge he  brought forth things both new and old for the instruction of our race,  the like of which, in some respects, had not been known in previous  dispensations. Hence I repeat that Joseph Smith was great; but great  as he was, rising up and towering far above him is the work that he  accomplished through divine guidance; that work is infinitely greater  than the prophet--greater than all the prophets connected with it. Its  consistency, its permanency, its power, its institutions, contradict  the hallucination theory advanced to account for its origin.    Let us look at this work for a moment. If one could but draw it clearly  in outline, and present it in its originality and greatness, it would  be its own witness of its divinity, for in all things it transcends the  mere wit of man. Take the Church organization for illustration; and  look at it with reference to its being an assemblage of means to the  accomplishment of an end. As I understand the Church of Christ, its  mission is two-fold; first, it is to proclaim the truth; second, it is  to perfect those who receive the truth. I think these two things cover,  in a general way, the entire mission of the Church. Is its organization  competent to attain those two mighty ends? Let us see; and first as to  the proclamation of the truth--the work really of the foreign ministry.  What provision has God made for that? He has in his Church, first of  all Twelve Special Witnesses, the Twelve Apostles, who were chosen  in the first instance, by the Three Special Witnesses to the Book of  Mormon. I remark in passing that there is a peculiar fitness in the  Twelve Apostles--the Twelve Special Witnesses being chosen by those  who had been made Witnesses for God by the great vision and revelation  he had given them concerning the absolute truth and correctness of the  Book of Mormon. Upon these Twelve Apostles rests the responsibility  of being witnesses for the Lord Jesus Christ in all the world. That  is their special, peculiar calling. You can see, however, if you take  into account the extent of their field of labor--for it encompasses  the whole round world--that twelve men would not be adequate to meet  all the requirements of the foreign ministry. God knew this, and hence  he called into existence other special witnesses, to labor under the  direction of these Twelve, they holding the keys to open the door of  the gospel to all the nations of the earth; for all must hear it, from  the greatest to the least. The Twelve, I say, hold the keys of this  foreign ministry; and hence whenever there has been an opening of  the door of the gospel to a foreign nation, one or more of these men  holding the keys have been sent to do it. It was for this reason that  Heber C. Kimball, one of the Twelve Apostles, was sent to Great Britain  in 1837, to open the door of the gospel in that land; why Elder John  Taylor was sent to France and Germany; why Elder Lorenzo Snow was sent  to Italy and Switzerland; why Erastus Snow was sent to the Scandinavian  countries; why Parley P. Pratt went to Chili and opened the door of the  gospel to the South American republics; why, more recently, Elder Heber  J. Grant was sent to Japan to open a mission. The Twelve, then, hold  the keys of this ministry, and upon them devolves this responsibility  of opening the door of salvation to the nations. But after them, other  witnesses are chosen. These are the seventy apostles, or special  witnesses, the assistants of the Twelve; under whose directions they  labor. At first, two quorums of Seventy only were organized; but  with the promise of the Prophet that as the work should expand other  quorums would be organized, not only till seven times seven quorums  should be brought into existence, but until seventy times seven; \"aye,\"  said he, \"until there shall be a hundred and forty and four thousand  seventies chosen, if the work of the ministry shall require it.\" So we  have continued organizing quorums of Seventy, to labor in the foreign  ministry, until now we have one hundred and forty-three quorums in the  Church--a body of nearly ten thousand men. They are special witnesses  of the name of Christ in all the world, and when their numbers are  considered, together with the privilege we have of increasing them, you  can see that ample provision is made, in this respect, for the work of  the foreign ministry.    But now let us consider their organization for a moment. Sixty-three  members with seven presidents, when the quorum is complete, constitute  a quorum. Suppose you were to send an entire quorum of Seventy bodily  into the world--I hope that will be done some day--you could break  that quorum into groups of ten. You could send with each group a  president. It should be remembered here that these presidents are  equal in authority. The council of a quorum of Seventy is made up  of seven presidents, not one president and six counsellors--but  seven presidents, equal in authority. For the sake of order in  administration, however, the right of initiative and presidency in  the council is recognized as being vested in the senior member by  ordination, not of age. And this principle is observed not only in  the case of the first or senior president, but all down the line in  the First Council, and in all quorum councils of the Seventies. By  this simple arrangement all confusion as to the right of presidency  is obviated; for no sooner does the council of a quorum, or any part  thereof, meet, in any part of the world than each president knows at  once upon whom the responsibility of initiative rests. But to return  to the groups of ten into which the quorum can be divided, with a  president for each group. You could break each group of ten into  five pairs, and scatter them out among the people, to bear effectual  witness of the truth of the gospel under the provision of the law of  the gospel; for it is the law of the gospel, one may say, for the  Elders to travel two and two, mainly for the reason, I suppose, that  God has declared that he would establish, his word in the mouth of two  or three witnesses; and it is good when bearing testimony to the world  that there should be the legal number of witnesses provided for in the  law of God. Moreover, there is a very much needed companionship and  sympathy provided for when the Elders travel two and two; and they are  a protection one to the other. You could scatter these groups of ten  in one or more states or countries; and they could occasionally meet  in group conferences, exchange experiences, give advice and counsel;  after which refreshing they could again divide into pairs, scatter  and so continue their ministry. Occasionally the seven groups of the  quorum could be brought together in general quorum conference, to take  counsel for making their ministry more and ever more effectual: to  readjust methods; to plan new campaigns; to strengthen each other by a  mutual exchange of experiences and sympathy; and do whatever else their  combined wisdom, helped by the inspiration of the Lord, would suggest  as right and proper to do in the furtherance of their high aim in  bringing to pass the salvation of men. Such are the possibilities of a  quorum of Seventy. It may become a veritable flying column of witnesses  for God, sweeping the earth with the testimony of Jesus, and calling  the inhabitants of the earth unto repentance! Can you think of this  beautiful arrangement for the foreign ministry as having its origin in  the alleged epileptic hallucinations of a man? Such a conception is  palpably absurd, and utterly revolting to reason.    Turn now for a moment to the home ministry of the Church, and what have  you? You have your stake organization, with its Presidency of three  presiding High Priests, aided in their counsels and labors by the High  Council of the stake, consisting of twelve High Priests. This council  also constitutes a judicial body for the settlement of difficulties  that may not be satisfactorily adjusted in the Bishop's courts. It is,  however, an ecclesiastical court of original as well as of appellate  jurisdiction. You have a Bishopric in the respective wards of the  Church, constituting the local presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood,  with quorums of Priests, Teachers and Deacons to aid them in the work  of their ministry. The Deacons take care of the house of the Lord,  and are to be assistants to the Teachers when occasion requires. The  Teachers are the watchmen upon the towers of Zion, and it is their  business to see that there is no iniquity in the Church--no backbiting,  no faultfinding, and that the members attend to their religious duties.  The Priests' duty is to visit the homes of the people and instruct  them in the gospel. Where they have sons or daughters who will not be  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4776"],[0,"Political Ideals (#8)"],[1,"that arise.  Should Welsh children be allowed the use  of the Welsh language in schools?  Should gipsies be compelled to  abandon their nomadic life at the bidding of the education  authorities?  Should miners have an eight-hour day?  Should Christian  Scientists be compelled to call in doctors in case of serious illness?  These are matters of passionate interest to certain sections of the  community, but of very little interest to the great majority.  If they  are decided according to the wishes of the numerical majority, the  intense desires of a minority will be overborne by the very slight and  uninformed whims of the indifferent remainder.  If the minority are  geographically concentrated, so that they can decide elections in a  certain number of constituencies, like the Welsh and the miners, they  have a good chance of getting their way, by the wholly beneficent  process which its enemies describe as log-rolling.  But if they are  scattered and politically feeble, like the gipsies and the Christian  Scientists, they stand a very poor chance against the prejudices of  the majority.  Even when they are geographically concentrated, like  the Irish, they may fail to obtain their wishes, because they arouse  some hostility or some instinct of domination in the majority.  Such a  state of affairs is the negation of all democratic principles.    The tyranny of the majority is a very real danger.  It is a mistake to  suppose that the majority is necessarily right.  On every new question  the majority is always wrong at first.  In matters where the state  must act as a whole, such as tariffs, for example, decision by  majorities is probably the best method that can be devised.  But there  are a great many questions in which there is no need of a uniform  decision.  Religion is recognized as one of these.  Education ought to  be one, provided a certain minimum standard is attained.  Military  service clearly ought to be one.  Wherever divergent action by  different groups is possible without anarchy, it ought to be  permitted.  In such cases it will be found by those who consider past  history that, whenever any new fundamental issue arises, the majority  are in the wrong, because they are guided by prejudice and habit.  Progress comes through the gradual effect of a minority in converting  opinion and altering custom.  At one time--not so very long ago--it  was considered monstrous wickedness to maintain that old women ought  not to be burnt as witches.  If those who held this opinion had been  forcibly suppressed, we should still be steeped in medieval  superstition.  For such reasons, it is of the utmost importance that  the majority should refrain from imposing its will as regards matters  in which uniformity is not absolutely necessary.      IV    The cure for the evils and dangers which we have been considering is a  very great extension of devolution and federal government.  Wherever  there is a national consciousness, as in Wales and Ireland, the area  in which it exists ought to be allowed to decide all purely local  affairs without external interference.  But there are many matters  which ought to be left to the management, not of local groups, but of  trade groups, or of organizations embodying some set of opinions.  In  the East, men are subject to different laws according to the religion  they profess.  Something of this kind is necessary if any semblance of  liberty is to exist where there is great divergence in beliefs.    Some matters are essentially geographical; for instance, gas and  water, roads, tariffs, armies and navies.  These must be decided by an  authority representing an area.  How large the area ought to be,  depends upon accidents of topography and sentiment, and also upon the  nature of the matter involved.  Gas and water require a small area,  roads a somewhat larger one, while the only satisfactory area for an  army or a navy is the whole planet, since no smaller area will prevent  war.    But the proper unit in most economic questions, and also in most  questions that are intimately concerned with personal opinions, is not  geographical at all.  The internal management of railways ought not to  be in the hands of the geographical state, for reasons which we have  already considered.  Still less ought it to be in the hands of a set  of irresponsible capitalists.  The only truly democratic system would  be one which left the internal management of railways in the hands of  the men who work on them.  These men should elect the general manager,  and a parliament of directors if necessary.  All questions of wages,  conditions of labor, running of trains, and acquisition of material,  should be in the hands of a body responsible only to those actually  engaged in the work of the railway.    The same arguments apply to other large trades: mining, iron and  steel, cotton, and so on.  British trade-unionism, it seems to me, has  erred in conceiving labor and capital as both permanent forces, which  were to be brought to some equality of strength by the organization of  labor.  This seems to me too modest an ideal.  The ideal which I  should wish to substitute involves the conquest of democracy and  self-government in the economic sphere as in the political sphere, and  the total abolition of the power now wielded by the capitalist.  The  man who works on a railway ought to have a voice in the government of  the railway, just as much as the man who works in a state has a right  to a voice in the management of his state.  The concentration of  business initiative in the hands of the employers is a great evil, and  robs the employees of their legitimate share of interest in the larger  problems of their trade.    French syndicalists were the first to advocate the system of trade  autonomy as a better solution than state socialism.  But in their view  the trades were to be independent, almost like sovereign states at  present.  Such a system would not promote peace, any more than it does  at present in international relations.  In the affairs of any body of  men, we may broadly distinguish what may be called questions of home  politics from questions of foreign politics.  Every group sufficiently  well-marked to constitute a political entity ought to be autonomous in  regard to internal matters, but not in regard to those that directly  affect the outside world.  If two groups are both entirely free as  regards their relations to each other, there is no way of averting the  danger of an open or covert appeal to force.  The relations of a group  of men to the outside world ought, whenever possible, to be controlled  by a neutral authority.  It is here that the state is necessary for  adjusting the relations between different trades.  The men who make  some commodity should be entirely free as regards hours of labor,  distribution of the total earnings of the trade, and all questions of  business management.  But they should not be free as regards the price  of what they produce, since price is a matter concerning their  relations to the rest of the community.  If there were nominal freedom  in regard to price, there would be a danger of a constant tug-of-war,  in which those trades which were most immediately necessary to the  existence of the community could always obtain an unfair advantage.  Force is no more admirable in the economic sphere than in dealings  between states.  In order to secure the maximum of freedom with the  minimum of force, the universal principle is: _Autonomy within each  politically important group, and a neutral authority for deciding  questions involving relations between groups_.  The neutral authority  should, of course, rest on a democratic basis, but should, if  possible, represent a constituency wider than that of the groups  concerned.  In international affairs the only adequate authority would  be one representing all civilized nations.    In order to prevent undue extension of the power of such authorities,  it is desirable and necessary that the various autonomous groups  should be very jealous of their liberties, and very ready to resist by  political means any encroachments upon their independence.  State  socialism does not tolerate such groups, each with their own officials  responsible to the group.  Consequently it abandons the internal  affairs of a group to the control of men not responsible to that group  or specially aware of its needs.  This opens the door to tyranny and  to the destruction of initiative.  These dangers are avoided by a  system which allows any group of men to combine for any given purpose,  provided it is not predatory, and to claim from the central authority  such self-government as is necessary to the carrying out of the  purpose.  Churches of various denominations afford an instance.  Their  autonomy was won by centuries of warfare and persecution.  It is to be  hoped that a less terrible struggle will be required to achieve the  same result in the economic sphere.  But whatever the obstacles, I  believe the importance of liberty is as great in the one case as it  has been admitted to be in the other.          Chapter IV: Individual Liberty and Public Control      I    Society cannot exist without law and order, and cannot advance except  through the initiative of vigorous innovators.  Yet law and order are  always hostile to innovations, and innovators are almost always, to  some extent, anarchists.  Those whose minds are dominated by fear of a  relapse towards barbarism will emphasize the importance of law and  order, while those who are inspired by the hope of an advance towards  civilization will usually be more conscious of the need of individual  initiative.  Both temperaments are necessary, and wisdom lies in  allowing each to operate freely where it is beneficent.  But those who  are on the side of law and order, since they are reinforced by custom  and the instinct for upholding the _status quo_, have no"]]]
