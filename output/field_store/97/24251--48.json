Before continuing the story I must note that Firishtah calls the king  of Vijayanagar \"Kishen Roy,\" otherwise Krishna Raya; but there can  be no doubt that his real name was Bukka. The historian collected  his information more than two hundred years after these events,  and often misnamed the Hindu kings of whom he writes.    Muhammad, then, crossed the Tungabhadra, and only about twenty-five  miles intervened between him and the great fortress of Adoni, which is  situated on a precipitous range of hills about that distance from the  river. The Tungabhadra at this portion of its course may be considered  as forming the arc, west to north, of a quarter circle having Adoni for  its centre, the radius roughly measuring about twenty-five miles. The  river is fordable at most seasons of the year, lying as it does in a  shallow rocky bed with low banks. It is difficult to locate with any  certainty the scenes of this campaign, but I gather generally that,  finding the Muhammadans aiming at the reduction of Adoni, Bukka marched  out with a very large force to intercept this move, and placed himself  on the south bank of the Tungabhadra, In the neighbourhood of the  threatened fortress. The Sultan crossed somewhere near the present town  of Siruguppa, and the great battle that ensued took place in the open  cotton-plains, perhaps near Kavutal (\"Kowtall\" on the Ordnance Map).    Here is Firishtah's account:[50] --    \"Roy Kishen Roy (I.E. Bukka), on receiving the intelligence (that  Muhammad had crossed), called together all the first nobles of his  court, and consulted on the best mode of opposing the mussulmauns. It  was agreed that Hoje Mul,[51] a maternal relation to the roy and  commander of his armies, should have the conduct of the war. Hoje Mul,  vain to excess, on receiving his command, asked the roy if he should  bring the prince of the mussulmauns alive a prisoner into his presence,  or present him only his head upon a spear. Kishen Roy replied, that  a living enemy, in any situation, was not agreeable, therefore he  had better put him to death as soon as he should take him. Hoje Mul,  having received his dismission marched to oppose Mahummud Shaw with  forty thousand horse and five hundred thousand foot. He commanded  the Bramins to deliver every day to the troops discourses on the  meritoriousness of slaughtering the mahummedans, in order to excite  zeal for expelling them. He ordered them to describe the butchery of  cows,[52] the insults to sacred images, and destroying of temples,  practised by the true believers.    \"Mahummud Shaw, when the enemy arrived within fifteen coss[53] of his  camp, commanded his general, Khan Mahummud, to muster the troops, who  were found to be fifteen thousand horse and fifty thousand foot. Ten  thousand horse and thirty thousand foot, with all the artillery,  he advanced under Khan Mahummud Khan.    \"On the 14th of Zeekaud (A.H. 767, or Thursday, July 23, A.D. 1366),  the armies of light and darkness met. From the dawn till four  in the afternoon, like the waves of the ocean, they continued in  warm conflict with each other, and great numbers were slain on both  sides. Mooseh Khan and Eeseh Khan, who commanded the right and left  wings of Khan Mahummud's line, drank the sherbet of martyrdom, and  their troops broke; which misfortune had nearly given a blow to the  army of Islaam. At this instant Mahummud Shaw appeared with three  thousand fresh horse. This restored the spirits of Khan Mahummud as  also of the disordered troops, who rallied and joined him. Mukkrib  Khan, advancing with the artillery, was not wanting in execution,  greatly disordering the enemy's horse and foot. He asked leave to  charge and complete the rout. Khan Mahummud upon this, detached a  number of the nobility to support him, and permitted him to advance;  which he did with such rapidity that the infidels had not time to use  fireworks (I.E. cannon), but cane to short weapons such as swords and  daggers. At this time an elephant, named Sheer Shikar,[54] belonging  to Khan Mahummud, refused the guidance of his driver, and rushed into  the center of the enemy's line, where he was stopped by the elephants  of Hoje Mul Roy, and his driver was killed. Khan Mahummud with five  hundred horse followed, and the elephant becoming unruly, turned  upon the enemy, throwing their ranks into confusion. Hoje Mul Roy,  after receiving a mortal wound, fled, and his followers no longer  made resistance. The infidels, seeing their center broke, fled on  all sides. The scymetars of the faithful were not yet sheathed from  slaughter when the royal umbrella appeared. The sultan gave orders  to renew the massacre of the unbelievers. They were executed with  such strictness that pregnant women, and even children at the breast,  did not escape the sword.    \"Mahummud Shaw halted a week on the field, and dispatched accounts  of his victory to his own dominions. In performance of his vow  of massacre he next marched towards the camp of Kishen Roy, who,  thinking himself unable to oppose notwithstanding his numerous force,  fled to the woods and mountains for shelter. The sultan followed him  from place to place for three months, putting to death all who came  in his way, without distinction. At length Kishen Roy took the road  of Beejanuggur, his capital. The sultan, pursuing, soon arrived with  his army near the city.\"    To make a long story short, the Sultan besieged Vijayanagar in vain  for a month, and then retreated across the Tungabhadra, harassed at  every step by masses of the Hindus from the city. He halted at last  in an open plain, and the king also pitched his camp at no great  distance. Muhammad's retreat had been deliberately carried out in  order to draw on his enemy, and cause him by over-confidence to  neglect proper precautions. The ruse was successful. The Muhammadans  made a sudden and unexpected night-attack. Bukka (called, as before,  \"Kishen\") was off his guard, having indulged in wine and the amusements  provided by a band of dancing-women. The slaughter was terrible, and  the Raya fled to Vijayanagar, ten thousand of his troops being slain;  -- \"But this did not satisfy the rage of the sultan, who commanded  the inhabitants of every place round Beejanuggur to be massacred  without mercy.\"    Then Bukka tried to make peace, but the Sultan refused.    \"At this time a favourite remarked to the sultan that he had only  sworn to slaughter one hundred thousand Hindoos, and not totally to  destroy their race The sultan replied that though twice the number  of his vow might have been slain, yet till the roy should submit, and  satisfy the musicians, he would not pardon him or spare the lives of  his subjects. To this the ambassadors, who had full powers, agreed,  and the money was paid at the instant. Mahummud Shaw then said,  'Praise be to God that what I ordered has been performed. I would  not let a light word be recorded of me in the pages of time!' \"    The ambassadors then pleaded that no religion ordained that the  innocent, and particularly helpless women and children, should suffer  for the guilty: --    \"If Kishen Roy had been faulty, the poor and wretched had not been  partakers in his crimes. Mahummud Shaw replied that the decrees of  providence had so ordered, and that he had no power to alter them.\"    The ambassadors finally urged that as the two nations were neighbours,  it were surely best to avoid unnecessary cruelty, which would only  embitter their relations with one another; and this argument had  effect.    \"Mahummud Shaw was struck by their remarks, and took an oath that  he would not in future put to death a single enemy after victory,  and would bind his successors to observe the same lenity.\"    For some years, no doubt, the promise was fulfilled, but we read of  wholesale massacres perpetrated by sovereigns of later date. As to  Muhammad, Firishtah glories in the statement that he had slaughtered  500,000 Hindus, and so wasted the districts of the Carnatic that for  several decades they did not recover their natural population.    Thus ended the war, and for some years there was peace between  Vijayanagar and Kulbarga.    Muhammad Shah died on 21st April A.D. 1375,[55] and was succeeded  by his son Mujahid, then nineteen years old. Shortly after his  accession Mujahid wrote to Bukka Raya (still called \"Kishen Roy\"  by Firishtah[56]), \"that as some forts and districts between the  Kistnah and Tummedra (Tungabhadra) rivers were held by them in  participation, which occasioned constant disagreements, he must for  the future limit his confines to the Tummedra, and give up all on  the eastern side to him, with the fort of Beekapore and some other  places.\" This \"Beekapore\" is the important fortress of Bankapur,  south of Dharwar. The Dakhani sovereigns always looked on it with  covetous eyes, as it lay on the direct route from Vijayanagar to the  sea, and its possession would paralyse Hindu trade.    The Raya replied by a counter-demand that the Sultan should evacuate  the whole of the Doab, since Raichur and Mudkal had always belonged  to the Anegundi family. Bukka declared the Krishna river to be the  true boundary, and asked that the elephants taken by Sultan Muhammad  should be restored.    The Sultan's answer was a declaration of war. He advanced in person,  crossed both the rivers, and arrived before Adoni. On hearing that the  Raya was encamped on the bank of the Tungabhadra, he left one force  to besiege the fortress, sent another to advance towards Vijayanagar,  and himself marched, probably in a north-westerly direction, towards  the river, \"by slow marches and with great caution.\" The Hindu prince  at first prepared to receive his attack, but for some reason[57]  lost heart and retired to the forests on the hills of Sandur, south  of his capital.

I trust the reader has not forgotten our old friend Don Simon Peon, to  whom, of course, our first visit was made. We were received by himself  and his mother, the Dona Joaquina, with the same kindness as on the  former occasion, and in a greater degree. They immediately offered all  in their power to further the objects of our visit, and to the last day  of our residence in the country we continued to feel the benefit of  their friendly assistance. For the present, the sala of the Dona  Joaquina was every evening the rendezvous of her large and respectable  family connexion; there we were in the habit of visiting at all times,  and had reason to believe that we were always welcome guests.    Among the first of Don Simon's good offices was a presentation to the  governor of the state. This gentleman, by reason of the peculiar  political position of Yucatan, occupied at that time a prominent and  important position; but, before introducing him to the reader, it may  not be amiss to give a brief account of the country of which he is the  official head.    It may be remembered that Columbus, in his first three voyages, did not  reach the Continent of America. On his fourth, final, and ill-fated  expedition, \"after sixty days of tempestuous weather, without seeing  sun or stars,\" he discovered a small island, called by the Indians  Guanaja, supposed to be that now laid down on some maps as the island  of Bonaca. While on shore at this island, he saw coming from the west a  canoe of large size, filled with Indians, who appeared to be a more  civilized people than any the Spaniards had yet encountered. In return  to the inquiries of the Spaniards for gold, they pointed toward the  west, and endeavoured to persuade them to steer in that direction.    \"Well would it have been for Columbus,\" says Mr. Irving, \"had he  followed their advice. Within a day or two he would have arrived at  Yucatan; the discovery of Mexico and the other opulent countries of New  Spain would have necessarily followed. The Southern Ocean would have  been disclosed to him, and a succession of splendid discoveries would  have shed fresh glory on his declining age, instead of its sinking amid  gloom, neglect, and disappointment.\"    Four years afterward, in the year 1506, Juan Dias de Solis, in company  with Vincent Yanez Pinzon, one of the companions of Columbus on his  last voyage, held the same course to the island of Guanaja, and then,  steering to the west, discovered the east coast of the province now  known by the name of Yucatan, and sailed along it some distance,  without, however, prosecuting the discovery.    On the eighth of February, 1517, Francisco Hernandez de Cordova, a rich  hidalgo of Cuba, with three vessels of good burden and one hundred and  ten soldiers, set sail from the port now known as St. Jago de Cuba, on  a voyage of discovery. Doubling St. Anton, now called Cape St. Antonio,  and sailing at hazard toward the west, at the end of twenty-one days  they saw land which had never been seen before by Europeans.    On the fourth of March, while making arrangements to land, they saw  coming to the ships five large canoes, with oars and sails, some of  them containing fifty Indians; and on signals of invitation being made,  above thirty came on board the captain's vessel. The next day the chief  returned with twelve large canoes and numerous Indians, and invited the  Spaniards to his town, promising them food, and whatever was necessary.  The words he used were _Conex cotoch_, which, in the language of the  Indians of the present day, means, \"Come to our town.\" Not  understanding the meaning, and supposing it was the name of the place,  the Spaniards called it Point or Cape Cotoche, which name it still  bears.    The Spaniards accepted the invitation, but, seeing the shore lined with  Indians, landed in their own boats, and carried with them fifteen  crossbows and ten muskets.    After halting a little while, they set out, the chief leading the way;  and, passing by a thick wood, at a signal from the chief a great body  of Indians in ambush rushed out, poured upon them a shower of arrows,  which at the first discharge wounded fifteen, and then fell upon them  with their lances; but the swords, crossbows, and firearms of the  Spaniards struck them with such terror that they fled precipitately,  leaving seventeen of their number slain.    The Spaniards returned to their ships, and continued toward the west,  always keeping in sight of land. In fifteen days they discovered a  large town, with an inlet which seemed to be a river. They went ashore  for water, and were about returning, when some fifty Indians came  toward them, dressed in good mantas of cotton, and invited them to  their town. After some hesitation, the Spaniards went with them, and  arrived at some large stone houses like those they had seen at Cape  Cotoche, on the walls of which were figures of serpents and other  idols. These were their temples, and about one of the altars were drops  of fresh blood, which they afterward learned was the blood of Indians,  sacrificed for the destruction of the strangers.    Hostile preparations of a formidable character were soon apparent, and  the Spaniards, fearing to encounter such a multitude, retired to the  shore, and embarked with their water-casks. This place was called  Kimpech, and at this day it is known by the name of Campeachy.    Continuing westwardly, they came opposite a town about a league from  the coast, which was called Potonchan or Champoton. Being again in  distress for water, they went ashore all together, and well armed. They  found some wells; filled their casks, and were about putting them into  the boats, when large bodies of warlike Indians came upon them from the  town, armed with bows and arrows, lances, shields, double-handed  swords, slings, and stones, their faces painted white, black, and red,  and their heads adorned with plumes of feathers. The Spaniards were  unable to embark their water-casks, and, as it was now nearly night,  they determined to remain on shore. At daylight great bodies of  warriors, with colours flying, advanced upon them from all sides. The  fight lasted more than half an hour; fifty Spaniards were killed; and  Cordova, seeing that it was impossible to drive back such a multitude,  formed the rest into a compact body and cut his way to the boats. The  Indians followed close at their heels, even pursuing them into the  water. In the confusion, so many of the Spaniards ran to the boats  together that they came near sinking them; but, hanging to the boats,  half wading and half swimming, they reached the small vessel, which  came up to their assistance. Fifty-seven of their companions were  killed, and five more died of their wounds. There was but one soldier  who escaped unwounded; all the rest had two, three, or four, and the  captain, Hernandez de Cordova, had twelve arrow wounds. In the old  Spanish charts this place is called the Bay \"de Mala Pelea,\" or  \"of  the bad fight.\"    This great disaster determined them to return to Cuba. So many sailors  were wounded that they could not man the three vessels, in consequence  of which they burned the smaller one, and, dividing the crew between  the other two, set sail. To add to their calamity, they had been  obliged to leave behind their water-casks, and they came to such  extremities with thirst, that their tongues and lips cracked open. On  the coast of Florida they procured water, and when it was brought  alongside one soldier threw himself from the ship into the boat, and,  seizing an earthen jar, drank till he swelled and died.    After this the vessel of the captain sprung a leak, but by great  exertions at the pumps they kept her from sinking, and brought her into  Puerto Carenas, which is now the port of Havana. Three more soldiers  died of their wounds; the rest dispersed, and the captain, Hernandez de  Cordova, died ten days after his arrival. Such was the disastrous end  of the first expedition to Yucatan.    In the same year, 1517, another expedition was set on foot. Four  vessels were fitted out, two hundred and forty companions enrolled  themselves, and Juan de Grijalva, \"a hopeful young man and  well-behaved,\" was named captain-in-chief.    On the sixth of April, 1518, the armament sailed from the port of  Matanzas for Yucatan. Doubling Cape San Antonio, and forced by the  currents farther down than its predecessor, they discovered the Island  of Cozumel.    Crossing over, and sailing along the coast, they came in sight of  Potonchan, and entered the Bay of Mala Pelea, memorable for the  disastrous repulse of the Spaniards. The Indians, exulting in their  former victory, charged upon them before they landed, and fought them  in the water; but the Spaniards made such slaughter that the Indians  fled and abandoned the town. The victory, however, cost them dear.  Three soldiers were killed, more than seventy wounded, and Juan de  Grijalva was hurt by three arrows, one of which knocked out two of his  teeth.    Embarking again, and continuing toward the west, in three days they saw  the mouth of a very broad river, which, as Yucatan was then supposed to  be an island, they thought to be its boundary, and called the Boca de  Terminos. At Tobasco they first heard the famous name of Mexico; and  after sailing on to Culua, now known as San Juan de Ulloa, the fortress  of Vera Cruz, and some distance beyond along the coast, Grijalva  returned to Cuba to add new fuel to the fire of adventure and  discovery.    Another expedition was got up on a grand scale. Ten ships were fitted  out, and it is creditable to"]]]
