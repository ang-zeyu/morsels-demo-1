Though old badgers and      foxes are often found in the same earth, more frequently when      one of the latter has been run to ground by hounds, yet, as a      rule, they give each other wide berths. If your correspondent      'Wilfred' wishes to save his cubs, let him kill every badger as      soon as possible.\"        \"Sir,--Replying to 'Wilfred's' question, 'Do badgers kill fox      cubs?' I cannot say they do, because there are no badgers in      this district; but having at different times had young foxes      killed in the way he describes, namely, bitten in the head, I      can assure him that it is done by an old dog fox. Should he wish      for further information, I refer him to Mr. John Douglas, Royal      Hotel, Pudding Chare, Newcastle-on-Tyne, who will tell him of      the experience he gained when at Clumber, under the Duke of      Newcastle.\"        \"Sir,--I may tell 'Wilfred' that I have never known old badgers      kill fox cubs, though I have studied the habits of both for      nearly forty years. No doubt an old vixen, with no cubs of her      own, killed his; the dog fox will not do this. Indeed, he will      cater for all the cubs of his own get, but a strange vixen is      very apt to kill any cubs which have no mother of their own. I      have known a terrier bitch kill a litter of foxhound puppies,      and one of my Irish terriers will kill puppies if she has the      chance. As to the 'natural' litter which 'Wilfred' found gone,      they had merely been shifted by the vixen; as soon as the cubs      get able to travel they are always shifted. Last year I had two      tame wild ducks sitting in a hedge. A badger passed regularly      within a yard of them every night, but they were undisturbed.      This year a fox took one of them just before it hatched. I was      sorry to read the other day in the _Field_ an account of two old      and four cub badgers having been dug out in Gloucestershire.      There is surely no sport in this, and the badgers are destitute      of grease now, whereas at Michaelmas they are fat enough to      provide grease for all the rheumatic people in the parish. I      like to catch one with my terriers when the harvest moon shines.      Sometimes I get up in a convenient tree near the earth and watch      the badgers feeding on the crazy roots. How fond they are of the      wild bees' honey, and also of wasps' nests. Let me advise      'Wilfred' to read the exhaustive and interesting account given      in a letter to the _Times_ (October 24, 1877), and quoted in      _Cassell's Natural History_, vol. ii. It thus concludes--'The      badgers and the foxes are not unfriendly, and last spring a      litter of cubs was brought forth very near the badgers; but      their mother removed them after they had grown familiar, as she      probably thought they were showing themselves more than was      prudent.' Mr. Ellis of Loughborough was the author of the      letter, and he had rare opportunities of studying the habits of      badgers.\"    I am loth to do it, but wishing to be an impartial historian, am  compelled to state that the badger is capable of vulpicide. As a rule he  can put up with an occasional lodger of the fox family, and live happily  with him, and from his superior qualities as an architect of  subterranean dwellings, he is on the whole an encourager of foxes. He  often gives up his spacious apartments to a vixen in the spring, and  submits to eviction. A fox will often take possession of a badger's  earth, new or old; and in order to persuade foxes to take to a  particular covert, no surer method can be pursued than to get badgers to  make earths when they are required. But even a badger's patience can be  exhausted, as the following history of my own experience will show. I  would premise, however, that I do not credit the oft-repeated story that  the fox gets rid of the badger by leaving his evacuations in the  badger's earth. Being the less and weaker animal, all a fox does is  allowed on sufferance. My suspicions of a badger's capability to wage  war on foxes were first aroused some years ago. The badgers had made a  fine double set of earths on the north side, of a hill in a neighbouring  larch wood, where no effort on my part to get foxes to breed and stay  had succeeded. No sooner, however, was a colony of badgers established  than foxes haunted the holes and covert. In a succession of years there  was as certain to be a litter of fox cubs in the badger earth as a  sunrise on the morrow.    What happened each spring was that the foxes and badgers frequented both  sets indiscriminately till about March. When the vixen lay in the  badgers abandoned the set of holes where she was, and restricted  themselves to the other set some twenty yards distant. Year after year  the fox cubs prospered and grew up, till one summer the keeper found a  fox cub in a field with his head bitten in two and terribly worried. I  did not know how to account for it. I watched the vixen and the other  cubs one evening to see that they were all right, and saw them, but  found they had left the earth and were in the covert. For two years all  went well and the foxes were unmolested, and then occurred something  that gave me a clue to the death of the cub three years before. Two  vixens lay in at the badgers' earth, and brought up their families of  seven and four respectively, till they were about one-third grown. There  were then to my knowledge at least four badgers and twelve foxes in  these two earths. On one or two occasions the stillness of the night was  broken by the veriest pandemonium at the earth, but still I did not  think much of it. At the end of the hunting season, at the end of April,  when the cubs were seven or eight weeks old, and a fortnight after the  hounds had been through the coverts, I found the largest and finest of  the vixens dead, and thought that, in spite of the earths being open,  she must have been chopped by the hounds. A post-mortem examination, as  well as the improbability of a vixen with cubs being out in the early  part of the day, convinced me that she had not been killed by hounds.  She seemed to have been badly bitten through the legs and thighs but not  on the body. From this time the other vixen and all the cubs left the  badgers' earths and remained in the covert. It was on this occasion that  an attempt to find out how many badgers there were in these earths was  rewarded by seeing seven full-grown badgers emerge from a single hole.  It was rough, no doubt, that the badgers should be invaded by two large  families of smelling foxes, and no doubt their patience had become  exhausted. Still I could not tolerate this kind of behaviour, and so I  had a dig at them, took two old ones out, and transported them to  Scotland. The following year there was peace and fox cubs again. The  year after, however, the vixen and her cubs took off into the covert  very early after another bit of Bank Holiday business, at a time of  night when all respectable people were quietly in bed. And yet all  through the year foxes are in the earth, and this spring, as heretofore,  a litter of cubs has been raised, but removed to another earth at a safe  distance from the badgers. I have never heard of badgers taking the  offensive against foxes; they will never molest a fox or vixen unless  their earth is invaded, and in my case if I had had no badgers in this  covert I should have had no foxes; and whilst it is annoying that the  fox cubs and vixen should be driven out, and perhaps occasionally  killed, the drawback is slight when it is considered that as long as  there are badgers there will be a litter of cubs, which nine times out  of ten will get safely off.    There are every now and then albino badgers reported, but I have never  seen one alive. I think, however, they are more subject to albinism than  most animals. I do not know of a case of melanism.    \"_White Badger at Overton, Hants._--While digging for badgers on April  30, we came across two dog badgers in the same earth, one of which was  quite white, the colour of a white ferret, with pink eyes.  Unfortunately, the terriers punished him so much he had to be destroyed.  I have helped to dig out a great many of these animals, but never saw  nor heard of a white one before.\"--T. P.          PART III      There are several methods by which the badger can be taken alive, or  killed, with ease. I am familiar with several successful ways of  trapping him. The reader, if he is not aware of these, must not expect  me to enlighten him, as my object in writing is to arouse an interest in  his preservation, not to facilitate his destruction. It may be as well  to state, however, that the inhuman engine, the steel trap (by which so  many of the birds and beasts that frequented the wild woods of England  and Scotland have been exterminated) is an instrument that arouses the  suspicion of a badger at once, and he is as clever in avoiding it as an  old-fashioned rat. The badger if caught in a steel trap will frequently  bite his leg or foot clean off. In my opinion there are two legitimate  methods of hunting the badger. First, that of a straight-forward attack  on his fortress; and should it be an old-established earth, it may be  the end of the longest day will not see the battle ended. There are, of  course, the fortunes of war--a lucky engagement, a wrong turn on the  part of the defender, a successful trench quickly cutting off his  retreat--which may deliver him unexpectedly into your hands; or the  enemy may outwit you altogether, conducting a masterful retreat, with  gallant sorties on the dogs, and by continually changing his front drive  you to abandon works, trenches, and operations that have cost great  labour and time; thus you may be left with a tired and wounded pack of  terriers, exhausted sappers, and the badger, having blocked and  barricaded his retreat with soil, stones, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36844"],[0,"In New England Fields and Woods (#8)"],[1,"not  so much as a scale, he is happy and content.    But how is it with him who comes stealing along with such light tread  that it scarcely crushes the violets or shakes the dewdrops from the  ferns, and casts his flies with such precise skill upon the very  handsbreadth of water that gives most promise to his experienced eye; or  drops his minnow with such care into the eddying pool, where he feels a  bass must lie awaiting it. Eye and ear and every organ of sense are  intent upon the sport for which he came. He sees only the images of the  clouds, no branch but that which impedes him or offers cover to his  stealthy approach. His ear is more alert for the splash of fishes than  for bird songs. With his senses go all his thoughts, and float not away  in day dreams.    Howsoever much he loves her, for the time while he hath rod in hand  Mother Nature is a fish-woman, and he prays that she may deal generously  with him. Though he be a parson, his thoughts tend not to religion;  though a savant, not to science; though a statesman, not to politics;  though an artist, to no art save the art of angling. So far removed from  all these while he casts his fly or guides his minnow, how much further  is his soul from all but the matter in hand when a fish has taken the  one or the other, and all his skill is taxed to the utmost to bring his  victim to creel. Heresy and paganism may prevail, the light of science  be quenched, the country go to the dogs, pictures go unpainted, and  statues unmoulded till he has saved this fish.    When the day is spent, the day's sport done, and he wends his way  homeward with a goodly score, satisfied with himself and all the world  besides, he may ponder on many things apart from that which has this day  taken him by green fields and pleasant waters. Now he may brood his  thoughts, and dream dreams; but while he angles, the complete angler is  not a contemplative man.      II    The rivers roaring between their brimming banks; the brooks babbling  over their pebbled beds and cross-stream logs that will be bridges for  the fox in midsummer; the freed waters of lakes and ponds, dashing in  slow beat of waves or quicker pulse of ripples against their shores, in  voices monotonous but never tiresome, now call all who delight in the  craft to go a-fishing.    With the sap in the aged tree, the blood quickens in the oldest angler's  veins, whether he be of the anointed who fish by the book, or of the  common sort who practice the methods of the forgotten inventors of the  art.    The first are busy with rods and reels that are a pleasure to the eye  and touch, with fly-books whose leaves are as bright with color as  painted pictures, the others rummaging corner-cupboards for mislaid  lines, searching the sheds for favorite poles of ash, ironwood,  tamarack, or cedar, or perhaps the woods for one just budding on its  sapling stump.    Each enjoys as much as the other the pleasant labor of preparation and  the anticipation of sport, though perhaps that of the scientific angler  is more aesthetic enjoyment, as his outfitting is the daintier and more  artistic. But to each comes the recollection of past happy days spent on  lake, river and brook, memories touched with a sense of loss, of days  that can never come again, of comrades gone forever from earthly  companionship.    And who shall say that the plebeian angler does not enter upon the  untangling of his cotton lines, the trimming of his new cut pole, and  the digging of his worms, with as much zest as his brother of the finer  cast on the testing and mending of lancewood or split bamboo rod, the  overhauling of silken lines and leaders, and the assorting of flies.      III    Considering the younger generation of anglers, one finds more enthusiasm  among those who talk learnedly of all the niceties of the art. They  scorn all fish not acknowledged as game. They plan more, though they may  accomplish less than the common sort to whom all of fishing tackle is a  pole, a line, and a hook. To them fishing is but fishing, and fish are  only fish, and they will go for one or the other when the signs are  right and the day propitious.    Descending to the least and latest generation of anglers, we see the  conditions reversed. The youth born to rod and reel and fly is not so  enthusiastic in his devotion to the sport as the boy whose birthright is  only the pole that craftsman never fashioned, the kinky lines of the  country store, and hooks known by no maker's name. For it is not in the  nature of a boy to hold to any nicety in sport of any sort, and this  one, being herein unrestrained, enters upon the art called gentle with  all the wild freedom of a young savage or a half-grown mink.    For him it is almost as good as going fishing, to unearth and gather in  an old teapot the worms, every one of which is to his sanguine vision  the promise of a fish. What completeness of happiness for him to be  allowed to go fishing with his father or grandfather or the acknowledged  great fisherman of the neighborhood, a good-for-nothing ne'er-do-well,  but wise in all the ways of fish and their taking and very careful of  and kind to little boys.    The high-hole never cackled so merrily, nor meadow lark sang sweeter,  nor grass sprang greener nor water shone brighter than to the boy when  he goes a-fishing thus accompanied. To him is welcome everything that  comes from the waters, be it trout, bass, perch, bullhead, or sunfish,  and he hath pride even in the abominable but toothsome eel and the  uneatable bowfin.    Well, remembering that we were once boys and are yet anglers, though we  seldom go a-fishing, we wish, in the days of the new springtide, to all  the craft, whether they be of high or low degree, bent and cramped with  the winter of age or flushed with the spring of life, pleasant and  peaceful days of honest sport by all watersides, and full creels and  strings and wythes.      IV    In the soft evenings of April when the air is full of the undefinable  odor of the warming earth and of the incessant rejoicing of innumerable  members of the many families of batrachians, one may see silently moving  lights prowling along the low shores of shallow waters, now hidden by  trunks of great trees that are knee-deep in the still water, now  emerging, illuminating bolls and branches and flashing their glimmering  glades far across the ripples of wake and light breeze.    If one were near enough he could see the boat of the spearers, its bow  and the intent figure of the spearman aglow in the light of the jack  which flares a backward flame with its steady progress, and drops a slow  shower of sparks, while the stern and the paddler sitting therein are  dimly apparent in the verge of the gloom.    These may be honest men engaged in no illegal affair; they exercise  skill of a certain sort; they are enthusiastic in the pursuit of their  pastime, which is as fair as jacking deer, a practice upheld by many in  high places; yet these who by somewhat similar methods take fish for  sport and food are not accounted honest fishermen, but arrant poachers.  If jacking deer is right, how can jacking fish be wrong? or if jacking  fish be wrong, how can jacking deer be right? Verily, there are nice  distinctions in the ethics of sport.          XVIII    FARMERS AND FIELD SPORTS        \"Happy the man whose only care        A few paternal acres bound,      Content to breathe his native air        On his own ground.\"      Happier still is such a one who has a love for the rod and gun, and with  them finds now and then a day's freedom from all cares by the side of  the stream that borders his own acres and in the woods that crest his  knolls or shade his swamp.    As a rule none of our people take so few days of recreation as the  farmer. Excepting Sundays, two or three days at the county fair, and  perhaps as many more spent in the crowd and discomfort of a cheap  railroad excursion, are all that are given by the ordinary farmer to  anything but the affairs of the farm. It is true that his outdoor life  makes it less necessary for him than for the man whose office or shop  work keeps him mostly indoors, to devote a month or a fortnight of each  year to entire rest from labor. Indeed, he can hardly do this except in  winter, when his own fireside is oftener the pleasantest place for rest.  But he would be the better for more days of healthful pleasure, and many  such he might have if he would so use those odd ones which fall within  his year, when crops are sown and planted or harvested. A day in the  woods or by the stream is better for body and mind than one spent in  idle gossip at the village store, and nine times out of ten better for  the pocket, though one come home without fin or feather to show for his  day's outing. One who keeps his eyes and ears on duty while abroad in  the field can hardly fail to see and hear something new, or, at least,  more interesting and profitable than ordinary gossip, and the wear and  tear of tackle and a few charges of ammunition wasted will cost less  than the treats which are pretty apt to be part of a day's loafing.    Barring the dearth of the objects of his pursuit, the farmer who goes  a-fishing and a-hunting should not be unsuccessful if he has fair skill  with the rod and gun. For he who knows most of the habits of fish and  game will succeed best in their capture, and no man, except the  naturalist and the professional fisherman and hunter, has a better  chance to gain this knowledge than the farmer, whose life brings him  into everyday companionship with nature. His fields and woods are the  homes and haunts of the birds and beasts of venery, from the beginning  of the year to its end, and in his streams many of the fishes pass their  lives. By his woodside the quail builds her nest, and when the foam of  blossom has dried away on the buckwheat field she leads her young there  to feed on the brown kernel stranded"]]]
