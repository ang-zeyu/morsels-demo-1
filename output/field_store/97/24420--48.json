[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4511"],[0,"The Life of the Bee (#8)"],[1,"s, selected as far as possible from among the oldest  bees in the hive. (The age of the bee can be readily told by its  body, which gradually becomes more polished, thinner, and almost  bald; and more particularly by the wings, which hard work uses and  tears.) It is their mission to feed the queen during the journey, to  tend her and guard her. I would frequently find, when the box  arrived, that nearly every one of the workers was dead. On one  occasion, indeed, they had all perished of hunger; but in this  instance as in all others the queen was alive, unharmed, and full of  vigour; and the last of her companions had probably passed away in  the act of presenting the last drop of honey she held in her sac to  the queen, who was symbol of a life more precious, more vast than  her own.    {28}    This unwavering affection having come under the notice of man, he  was able to turn to his own advantage the qualities to which it  gives rise, or that it perhaps contains: the admirable political  sense, the passion for work, the perseverance, magnanimity, and  devotion to the future. It has allowed him, in the course of the  last few years, to a certain extent to domesticate these intractable  insects, though without their knowledge; for they yield to no  foreign strength, and in their unconscious servitude obey only the  laws of their own adoption. Man may believe, if he choose, that,  possessing the queen, he holds in his hand the destiny and soul of  the hive. In accordance with the manner in which he deals with  her--as it were, plays with her--he can increase and hasten the  swarm or restrict and retard it; he can unite or divide colonies,  and direct the emigration of kingdoms. And yet it is none the less  true that the queen is essentially merely a sort of living symbol,  standing, as all symbols must, for a vaster although less  perceptible principle; and this principle the apiarist will do well  to take into account, if he would not expose himself to more than  one unexpected reverse. For the bees are by no means deluded. The  presence of the queen does not blind them to the existence of their  veritable sovereign, immaterial and everlasting, which is no other  than their fixed idea. Why inquire as to whether this idea be  conscious or not? Such speculation can have value only if our  anxiety be to determine whether we should more rightly admire the  bees that have the idea, or nature that has planted it in them.  Wherever it lodge, in the vast unknowable body or in the tiny ones  that we see, it merits our deepest attention; nor may it be out of  place here to observe that it is the habit we have of subordinating  our wonder to accidents of origin or place, that so often causes us  to lose the chance of deep admiration; which of all things in the  world is the most helpful to us.    {29}    These conjectures may perhaps be regarded as exceedingly  venturesome, and possibly also as unduly human. It may be urged that  the bees, in all probability, have no idea of the kind; that their  care for the future, love of the race, and many other feelings we  choose to ascribe to them, are truly no more than forms assumed by  the necessities of life, the fear of suffering or death, and the  attraction of pleasure. Let it be so; look on it all as a figure of  speech; it is a matter to which I attach no importance. The one  thing certain here, as it is the one thing certain in all other  cases, is that, under special circumstances, the bees will treat  their queen in a special manner. The rest is all mystery, around  which we only can weave more or less ingenious and pleasant  conjecture. And yet, were we speaking of man in the manner wherein  it were wise perhaps to speak of the bee, is there very much more we  could say? He too yields only to necessity, the attraction of  pleasure, and the fear of suffering; and what we call our intellect  has the same origin and mission as what in animals we choose to term  instinct. We do certain things, whose results we conceive to be  known to us; other things happen, and we flatter ourselves that we  are better equipped than animals can be to divine their cause; but,  apart from the fact that this supposition rests on no very solid  foundation, events of this nature are rare and infinitesimal,  compared with the vast mass of others that elude comprehension; and  all, the pettiest and the most sublime, the best known and the most  inexplicable, the nearest and the most distant, come to pass in a  night so profound that our blindness may well be almost as great as  that we suppose in the bee.    {30}    \"All must agree,\" remarks Buffon, who has a somewhat amusing  prejudice against the bee,--\"all must agree that these flies,  individually considered, possess far less genius than the dog, the  monkey, or the majority of animals; that they display far less  docility, attachment, or sentiment; that they have, in a word, less  qualities that relate to our own; and from that we may conclude that  their apparent intelligence derives only from their assembled  multitude; nor does this union even argue intelligence, for it is  governed by no moral considerations, it being without their consent  that they find themselves gathered together. This society,  therefore, is no more than a physical assemblage ordained by nature,  and independent either of knowledge, or reason, or aim. The  mother-bee produces ten thousand individuals at a time, and in the  same place; these ten thousand individuals, were they a thousand  times stupider than I suppose them to be, would be compelled, for  the mere purpose of existence, to contrive some form of arrangement;  and, assuming that they had begun by injuring each other, they  would, as each one possesses the same strength as its fellow, soon  have ended by doing each other the least possible harm, or, in other  words, by rendering assistance. They have the appearance of  understanding each other, and of working for a common aim; and the  observer, therefore, is apt to endow them with reasons and intellect  that they truly are far from possessing. He will pretend to account  for each action, show a reason behind every movement; and from  thence the gradation is easy to proclaiming them marvels, or  monsters, of innumerable ideas. Whereas the truth is that these ten  thousand individuals, that have been produced simultaneously, that  have lived together, and undergone metamorphosis at more or less the  same time, cannot fail all to do the same thing, and are compelled,  however slight the sentiment within them, to adopt common habits, to  live in accord and union, to busy themselves with their dwelling, to  return to it after their journeys, etc., etc. And on this foundation  arise the architecture, the geometry, the order, the foresight, love  of country,--in a word, the republic; all springing, as we have  seen, from the admiration of the observer.\" There we have our bees  explained in a very different fashion. And if it seem more natural  at first, is it not for the very simple reason that it really  explains almost nothing? I will not allude to the material errors  this chapter contains; I will only ask whether the mere fact of the  bees accepting a common existence, while doing each other the least  possible harm, does not in itself argue a certain intelligence. And  does not this intelligence appear the more remarkable to us as we  more closely examine the fashion in which these \"ten thousand  individuals\" avoid hurting each other, and end by giving assistance?  And further, is this not the history of ourselves; and does not all  that the angry old naturalist says apply equally to every one of our  human societies? And yet once again: if the bee is indeed to be  credited with none of the feelings or ideas that we have ascribed to  it, shall we not very willingly shift the ground of our wonder? If  we must not admire the bee, we will then admire nature; the moment  must always come when admiration can be no longer denied us, nor  shall there be loss to us through our having retreated, or waited.    However these things may be, and without abandoning this conjecture  of ours, that at least has the advantage of connecting in our mind  certain actions that have evident connection in fact, it is certain  that the bees have far less adoration for the queen herself than for  the infinite future of the race that she represents. They are not  sentimental; and should one of their number return from work so  severely wounded as to be held incapable of further service, they  will ruthlessly expel her from the hive. And yet it cannot be said  that they are altogether incapable of a kind of personal attachment  towards their mother. They will recognise her from among all. Even  when she is old, crippled, and wretched, the sentinels at the door  will never allow another queen to enter the hive, though she be  young and fruitful. It is true that this is one of the fundamental  principles of their polity, and never relaxed except at times of  abundant honey, in favour of some foreign worker who shall be well  laden with food.    When the queen has become completely sterile, the bees will rear a  certain number of royal princesses to fill her place. But what  becomes of the old sovereign? As to this we have no precise  knowledge; but it has happened, at times, that apiarists have found  a magnificent queen, in the flower of her age, on the central comb  of the hive; and in some obscure corner, right at the back, the  gaunt, decrepit \"old mistress,\" as they call her in Normandy. In  such cases it would seem that the bees have to exercise the greatest  care to protect her from the hatred of the vigorous rival who longs  for her death; for queen hates queen so fiercely that two who might  happen to be under the same roof would immediately fly at each  other. It would be pleasant to believe that the bees are thus  providing their ancient sovereign with a humble shelter "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45149"],[0,"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern (#8)"],[1," hand-breadth  in thickness, and the brim was embellished with flower work. It was  mounted on twelve brazen oxen, arranged in groups of three, the groups  facing respectively north, south, east and west. The great font stood  between the altar and the porch \"on the right side of the house,  eastward, over against the south.\"[49] Associated with the molten sea  were ten smaller vessels called lavers, mounted on bases of special  construction and provided with wheels to facilitate removal.[50] The  lavers were used in connection with the service of the altar, for the  washing of the offerings; but the main font or molten sea was reserved  for the ceremonial cleansing of the priests.    When the House of the Lord was completed, elaborate preparations were  made for its dedication. First came the installation of the Ark of the  Covenant and its appurtenances, the Tabernacle of the Congregation,  and the holy vessels. With great solemnity and to the accompaniment of  ceremonial sacrifice, the Ark was brought by the priests and placed  within the Holy of Holies beneath the wings of the cherubim. At this  time the Ark contained only the two tables of stone \"which Moses put  there.\" The staves by which the Ark was borne were so drawn out as to  be visible from within the Holy Place, and then \"it came to pass, when  the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the  house of the Lord, So that the priests could not stand to minister  because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of  the Lord.\"[51]    {41} Then Solomon addressed the assembled multitude, reciting the  circumstances under which the building of the Temple had been conceived  by his father David and executed by himself, and proclaiming the mercy  and goodness of Israel's God. Standing before the altar of the Lord, in  the court of the Temple, the king spread forth his hands toward heaven,  and offered the dedicatory prayer. The king then blessed the people,  saying \"Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people  Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one  word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses  his servant. The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers:  let him not leave us, nor forsake us.\"[52]    The principal services with the attendant festivities lasted seven  days, and \"on the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed  the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all  the goodness that the Lord had done for David his servant, and for  Israel his people.\"[53]    For only a third of a century did this splendid edifice maintain its  supremacy and glory. In the later years of his reign Solomon had done  wickedly in the sight of God and the people had not been slow to follow  their king in evil paths. Israel had grown weak in their allegiance to  Jehovah and had gone after strange gods. Following the death of Solomon  the nation was disrupted. In the fifth year of the reign of Rehoboam,  Shishak king of Egypt besieged the City of David and even despoiled  the Temple {42} and carried away part of the sacred treasures. Next,  Jehoash, king of one part of the divided nation, took away gold and  silver and sacred vessels from the House of the Lord and carried  them into Samaria.[54] It is thus shown that the desecration of the  Temple was not effected wholly by the enemies of Israel; the people to  whom the House had once been sacred contributed to its profanation.  Ahaz, the wicked king of Judah, removed the altar from its place and  substituted therefore another fashioned by his own order after the  pattern of the altars of the heathen; moreover he took down the molten  sea and dismantled the lavers.[55] Mannasseh, another evil king who  reigned in Judah, followed after Baal and set up idolatrous shrines  within the very precincts of the Temple.[56] The precious things of the  House of the Lord were used as barter between kings. So, Asa king of  Judah purchased the aid of Ben-hadad, to fight against Israel;[57] so  also did Jehoash purchase peace from Hazael king of Syria;[58] and so  did Hezekiah strip the House of the Lord for plunder wherewith to pay  tribute to the Assyrians.[59]    Some attempts were made to repair the worst of the ravages upon and  within the Temple[60] but it seemed that the House had been abandoned  to its fate. In the year 586 B. C., Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,  completed the destruction of the Temple in connection with {43} his  conquest of the kingdom of Judah. Whatever of value was yet there he  carried away, and the building was destroyed by fire.[61]    There occurs yet one later mention of some of the vessels that had been  made for the service of Jehovah,--when they were brought out to crown  the triumph of Belshazzar in his heathenish feast. Then was manifest  the displeasure of the Lord, and the trembling king heard from the  lips of Daniel his doom,--for he had been unmindful of the fate that  had overtaken his father, and had lifted up himself against the Lord  of heaven; and had brought out the vessels of the house of God that he  and his lords, his wives and his concubines might drink wine therefrom;  and he had praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood,  and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; but the God in whose hand  was his breath and whose were all his ways had he not glorified. He had  been weighed in the balances and was found wanting; and his kingdom was  taken from him. That night, Belshazzar the king was slain.[62]    THE TEMPLE OF EZEKIEL'S VISION    In the twenty-fifth year of the Babylonian captivity, while yet the  people of Israel were in exile in a strange land, the word of the Lord  came to the prophet Ezekiel; the power of God rested upon him; and he  saw in vision a glorious Temple, the plan of which he minutely {44}  described.[63] As to whether the prophet himself considered the design  so shown as one to be subsequently realized, or as but a grand yet  unattainable ideal, is not declared. Certain it is that the Temple of  the vision has not yet been builded.    In most of its essential features Ezekiel's ideal followed closely the  plan of Solomon's Temple; so close, indeed, is the resemblance, that  many of the details specified by Ezekiel have been accepted as those  of the splendid edifice destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. A predominant  characteristic of the Temple described by Ezekiel was the spaciousness  of its premises and the symmetry of both the Holy House and its  associated buildings. The area was to be a square of five hundred  cubits, walled about and provided with a gateway and arches on each  of three sides; on the west side the wall was to be unbroken by arch  or portal. At each of the gateways were little chambers regarded as  lodges,[64] and provided with porches. In the outer court were other  chambers. The entire area was to be elevated, and a flight of steps led  to each gateway. In the inner court was seen the great altar, standing  before the House, and occupying the center of a square of one hundred  cubits.[65] Ample provision was made for every variety of sacrifice  and offering, and for the accommodation of the priests, the singers,  and all engaged in the holy ritual.[66] The main structure comprised  a Porch, a Holy Place, and an inner sanctuary or Most Holy Place, the  last named elevated above the rest {45} and reached by steps. The plan  provided for even greater exclusiveness than had characterized the  sacred area of the Temple of Solomon; the double courts contributed  to this end. The service of the Temple was prescribed in detail; the  ordinances of the altar, the duties of the priests, the ministry of the  Levites, the regulations governing oblations and feasts were all set  forth.[67]    The immediate purpose of this revelation through the vision of the  prophet appears to have been that of awakening the people of Israel to  a realization of their fallen state and a conception of their departed  glory. The prophet was thus commanded:        \"Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that      they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the      pattern.        \"And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, show them the      form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out      thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and      all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the      laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the      whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.        \"This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the      whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is      the law of the house.\"[68]    THE TEMPLE OF ZERUBBABEL    For three score years and ten the Jews had grieved and groaned under  Babylonian rule. The greater part of the once proud Kingdom of Judah  had been carried {46} away captive, and such as remained in the land  of their fathers had lost their national status and had become largely  merged with the Gentiles. With dreadful exactness had been fulfilled  the dire prediction of Jeremiah. Through that prophet the Lord had  spoken, saying:        \"Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Because ye have not heard      my words,        \"Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith      the Lord, and Nebuchadrezzar [Nebuchadnezzar] the king of Babylon,      my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the      inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations around about,      and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and      an hissing, and perpetual desolations.        \"Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice      of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the      bride, the sound of the "]]]
