Vol. 1 (of 3) (#8)"],[1,"\" said his granddaughter, \"I am her warmest admirer, and--\"    Here Nurse appeared in _propriâ personâ_, and announced dinner. \"Give  Kate your arm, Egerton: I wish I had a fair lady to escort myself.\"    \"Did you communicate your fears for my brother's health, when your  nurse enquired for him?\" I asked, as we crossed the hall to the dining  room.    \"_De grâce_,\" said Miss Vernon, \"let that rest; we have little to  reproach each other with. We both behaved very badly.\"    \"At least, I had temptation to plead in excuse, but your motive was  sheer mischief!\"    \"And you call that no temptation, do you?\"    The dining room looked on a different view of the river and fields,  and gave a peep of a wood on the opposite bank, which I had not yet  seen. Its furniture bespoke the absence of wealth; the only approach  to ornament was a gracefully shaped basket filled with bright flowers,  which did duty as an epergne; while the well-polished plate, bright  glass, and snowy table linen, were admirable substitutes for more  costly addenda; and equally refreshing was the simple dinner of trout  from the river, Welch mutton, and fresh fruit, to my palate, wearied  with the hacknied _entrées_ of our regimental chef.    Nurse performed the part of butler with much _empressement_, and  occasionally, in reply to any question from her master, joined with  much ease and self-possession in the conversation.    There was something deliciously new to me in the whole entertainment.  My experience of dinners had been confined to the _olla podrida_ of  the mess table, and the equally long full dress affairs at which I had  assisted, both in town and country, with an occasional scramble at an  hotel or restaurant; but here there were grace and order that did not  convey the idea of employing a host of attendants, and consuming a  small fortune in its production; in short, it appeared to possess the  charm of home, which nothing costly or studied ever conveys.    \"You have a different view here,\" I observed, looking up from my plate  to the prospect before me, \"and I fancy it will afford some sketchable  points.\"    \"Then you sketch; how pleasant!\" said Miss Vernon.    \"It was a search for the picturesque brought him here,\" replied the  Colonel.    \"For the beautiful and picturesque, Colonel,\" I added.    \"Well, well, they are generally united.\"    \"Certainly, in this case,\" said I.    \"I am glad I asked the Winters this evening.\"    \"My dear master will give you a _carte du pays_; he has great genius,  though I tell him he is too fond of bread and cheese subjects,\"  observed Miss Vernon.    \"Bread and cheese subjects?\" I asked.    \"He made an admirable picture of two boys eating bread and cheese, and  is rather fond of that style of subjects, which I call, after his first  attempt,\" she replied.    \"I prefer bread and cheese to Gods and Goddesses myself, but Kate has  nurse on her side. The jelly;--thank you. Nurse, how do you like Mr.  Winter's pictures; you've seen them?\" said the Colonel.    \"'Deed then I have, sir; it's the scum of the earth he paints; a  gentleman painther should be above such raff! Sure little Billy  McKeogh, in Killeash, would never put a brush to anything ondher  Jupither or Vanius, with crowns on their heads; and whin me uncle  wanted a Coach and Horses for a sign, me bould Billy sis, sis he, I  don't like thim low subjects, sis he, an he only a bit of a boy. Was  the fish right, sir?\" This conclusion was _sotto voce_ and addressed  with a confidential bend to her master's ear, but reached mine  also. Miss Vernon, however, replied aloud and without a shadow of  embarrassment at this domestic query.    \"The fish was very nice, dear nurse.\"    \"It was a _chef d'oeuvre_, Colonel,\" I exclaimed; \"we must try to win  nurse over to us; Brougière, our _chef_, can do nothing like it.\"    \"A few lessons from Mrs. O'Toole,\" suggested nurse, modestly.    \"Ah yes, Mrs. O'Toole would be invaluable.\"    \"See that, now,\" said nurse, with a triumphant look, as she retired.    \"That's a great character,\" I remarked.    \"And a good one; I do love nurse!\" returned Miss Vernon.    \"She is thoroughly Irish; an Englishman seldom appreciates such a  character,\" said her grandfather.    \"But I may do so, I am half Irish; my mother was a De Burgh,\" I  exclaimed eagerly.    \"Indeed!\" said Miss Vernon.    \"Oh, I remember something of that,\" observed Colonel Vernon.    \"Besides, Miss Vernon, did I not serve an apprenticeship to all that is  pleasantest in Irish life at Dungar,\" I continued.    \"Bravo!\" cried the Colonel.    \"We admit you are half a compatriot,\" said Miss Vernon.    \"It is curious, Kate's distinct remembrance of you when you used  to play so good naturedly with her at Dungar, and her total  unconsciousness of your identity at the ball.\"    \"It is too provoking,\" I returned, \"to think my stratagem was in fact  unnecessary. Could I have discovered your name I am certain Dungar  would have immediately presented itself to my memory. Miss Vernon looks  like an Irish woman, and--\"    \"It is well you have so clearly made out your perfect familiarity with  Irish life. The English ideal of an Irish woman, generally presents a  broad face, wide mouth, and torn petticoat,\" said she, laughing.    I had sufficient tact not to reply, save by a look, which I was glad to  perceive possessed sufficient eloquence to call up the _soupçon_ of a  blush into the speaker's cheek.    \"Believe me, I tried hard for some legitimate introduction before I  ventured on my bold attempt.\"    \"Yes,\" said the Colonel, laughing, \"you were, I remember, _remarkable_  for your timidity.\"    \"You certainly did look a little amazed when I pretended to recognize  you,\" remarked Miss Vernon, \"but only for a moment. There was a Mr.  Harcourt I used to meet at Lady Desmond's, a very fine gentleman;  something like you, with whom for the sake of consistency I chose to  identify you. You see, grandpapa, I could not have danced but for some  such _ruse_, and when I proposed merely looking on, I did not calculate  how the sounds and sights of a ball-room would rouse the old leaven  within me.\"    \"My good star was in the ascendant; but for your admirable treatment  of my audacity I should have been still ignorant that I had old friends  within reach.\"    \"You would have stumbled on me in some of your sketching expeditions,\"  observed the Colonel.    I exclaimed hastily \"Yes, but--\" and stopping my imprudent revelations,  rose to open the door for Miss Vernon, who left us, saying she had  outstaid the proper interval for ladies. We soon followed her, and  stood gazing at a fine harvest moon, which was gradually silvering the  rocks and the river, as daylight disappeared, until the arrival of Miss  Vernon's guests speedily broke in upon our pleasant reminiscent chat,  and I was formally introduced.    Mrs. Winter looked rather puzzled. \"I thought, my dear, it was all a  mistake, your dancing with this gentleman?\"    \"Well, Mrs. Winter, the whole affair is now in such an entanglement  of mistakes that I advise you not to attempt unravelling it; rest  content with the assurance that Captain Egerton is a _bonâ fide_ old  acquaintance, fully recognised by grandpapa and myself.\"    \"I am sure I never meant I doubted it,\" said Kate's ex-chaperon, with a  little twittering embarrassed laugh, \"but\"--    \"I am going to make tea, and you had better make your peace with  Captain Egerton, whom you evidently doubt,\" returned Miss Vernon.    I seated myself beside Mrs. Winter and drew her into conversation,  by praising the old town and its _locale_, with very genuine warmth;  it was her native place, and my appreciation of it seemed to open  her heart. We then in some imperceptible manner glided into natural  history, and I was listening with every appearance of thrilling  interest, to a circumstantial account of the habits and customs of a  pug dog, called Fan, when Miss Vernon approached with a cup of tea,  whereupon my informant rose, saying she would go to the tea table,  around which we all now assembled.    \"Captain Egerton is a brother of the brush, Mr. Winter,\" said Miss  Vernon.    \"Indeed!\" he replied, with a sharp keen glance, \"what's your style,  sir?\"    \"Oh, I merely sketch; sometimes in water colours, but generally in  chalks. Very rude attempts, I assure you.\"    \"It's a glorious gift, any portion of power to transfer living nature  to dead canvass or paper. Miss Vernon tells me that she would give  worlds to be a painter, and yet she will not even try to draw.\"    \"I _do_ try,\" she exclaimed, \"I feel my eyesight failing fast in the  effort; but you cannot force nature, and she did not intend me for a  proficient in your noble art.\"    \"Pooh, pooh,\" cried Winter, \"don't tell me that with your eye for the  beautiful, for colors, for grace (look at the arrangement of those  flowers, Captain Egerton), that you have no genius for painting; you  have been shamefully neglected, and all your talents forced into  another species of harmony, more fashionable but infinitely inferior.\"    And he puffed, wiped his forehead, and swallowed his cup of tea at a  gulp.    \"Mr. Winter, I will not allow you to misrepresent yourself,\" said Miss  Vernon, \"you love music in your very soul; do not pretend to think it  inferior for the sake of argument!\"    \"It _is_ inferior; painting appertains more to the intellect than  music,\" rejoined Winter stoutly.    \"We know that angels sing in Heaven, but we never heard of their  sketching,\" replied Miss Vernon.    Mr. Winter, the Colonel, and I, laughed heartily at Miss Vernon's novel  argument, and Winter, recovered from the momentary shock with a hasty  \"Pooh, pooh, Heaven indeed! Look at the lives of eminent painters, and  then look at the lives of musicians.\"    \"I would rather not,\" said his antagonist.    \"Yes, it is strange,\" I observed, \"but painters seem to be a less  dissipated set of fellows than musicians; yet surely there is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47449"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 8 (of 8) (#8)"],[1," Premier, with reference to the attempt of  Mr. Rhodes to secure the unification of South Africa, \"Mr. Rhodes made  one mistake. He made the mistake of being too impatient. Had he allowed  time for development, had he allowed the Dutch population to get  reconciled to the idea of British citizenship, they would have had much  sooner than will be the case the federation of South Africa, _which is  the only future of that great country_.\"    To judge from the spirit of his utterances in Canada on the subject of  South Africa, it would appear that Sir Wilfrid Laurier's opinions as to  the best means of working towards the end of South African Federation  do not materially differ from those of Sir Edmund Barton. He believes  that the free consent of the new Colonies should be obtained, and that  the policy pursued with regard to Manitoba by the \"Fathers of  Confederation\"--a policy of which he disapproved at the time, a policy  which led to a long series of disputes between Manitoba and the Dominion  Government--should not be pursued in the case of the Transvaal and  Orange River Colonies. It will be remembered that the \"Red River  Settlement\" received Provincial status on condition of becoming a member  of confederation, and that the terms of membership were accepted under  compulsion, and in the hope that they could be bettered.          LAW AND LANGUAGE    BY MR. M. J. FARRELLY, LL.D.    _Barrister-at-Law; Advocate of the Supreme Court of Cape Colony_      I.--THE ROMAN DUTCH LAW AND THE LAW OF ENGLAND    The Roman Dutch Law--the body of legal principles and enactments  codified under the later Roman Empire by the Emperor Justinian, as  modified by legislation of the States-General and decisions of the  tribunals of Holland up to the end of the eighteenth century--the date  of the British occupation of Cape Colony--constitutes the Common Law of  all British South Africa from the Zambesi to the sea. Indeed its sway  stretches farther north, if we include the province of Northern  Rhodesia.    The recent annexation to the Empire of the territories of the two Boer  Republics must necessarily have many effects not alone in the sphere of  politics, but also in that of law. But no unsettling of the general  principles of private law, regulating the rights and duties of the  citizens in private relations, can be the result. The invariable  practice of the Imperial Government--the only possible one to prevent  inextricable confusion of personal status and property rights--has  always been to enforce, as the unaltered law of the land, any system of  European Law already in operation in territories annexed or ceded to the  Empire, being already a portion of the dominion of any State of the  European Family of Nations. In this respect the Imperial Government but  follows the general practice of other European States: a practice so  uniform that it may almost be regarded as a portion of the Law of  Nations, of that custom of the European race which for a century we are  accustomed to speak of as International Law. The committee of the Privy  Council, which, as regards the Empire outside of Europe, may be viewed  as the Imperial Court of Appeal, has therefore to adjudicate on systems  of law more numerous than these that come before any other tribunal in  the world. Not alone questions to be determined under the Common Law of  England, but suits to be decided under that law, as modified by the  legislation of the self-governing Colonies, come under the cognisance of  that unique tribunal. From the Channel Islands, whose people boast that  they were never conquered by England, are heard appeals, based on the  _Grand Coutumier de Normandie_, unknown in France since the French  Revolution. The French Law of Lower Canada, still administered under  British authority, is lifeless and unknown in the Paris which gave it  birth. Similarly the Roman Dutch Law of the United Provinces, now  enforced in the former over-sea possessions of Holland, has long ago  been swept away in Low Countries, surviving as the law of the land only  in the British possessions, in South America, in Ceylon, and in South  Africa. With one result, arresting the attention of the historical  student, that in our own day British tribunals accept, as of the highest  authority--in many matters most vitally affecting the status and  property of British citizens from the Lion's Head to the Line, the  recorded opinions of a Pretorian prefect of the Roman Empire in  York--the brightest of the five stars of the _Loi des Citations_.    The tribunals of the Empire constitute a museum of former systems of  law, flourishing far from their parent springs. But every change is not  necessarily progress. The marked liking of British colonists, born in  the United Kingdom, for the Roman Law under whose sway they have passed  is a very instructive phenomenon. Wisdom, they seem to think, did not  die with the fashioners of that \"codeless myriad of precedents, that  wilderness of single instances\" which, evolved according to  imperturbable theory from the bosom of the English judiciary, is known  as the Law of England.    This preference is the more impressive, seeing that on many vital  matters, not mere abstractions of jurisprudence, the Roman Dutch Law  differs from the English systemless system.    The personal status of all residents in the new British Colonies falls  under rules quite different from the English rules as to capacity to  enter into and to perform contracts, as to property rights, and as to  family relations. Results of some importance may chiefly be expected  from the fact that, since the annexation and the transformation of the  Republics into British Colonies, the presumption in law that British  immigrants intend to adopt a new domicile, and subject themselves and  their property to a new legal system, must necessarily be stronger than  when residence was being taken up in the territory, then foreign, of two  Boer Republics. In the future, not alone, as hitherto, contracts of  service and contracts as regards property, but the relationship,  personal and as affecting property, of marriage and succession, will  fall under the jurisdiction of a High Court administering primarily the  Law of Rome. The Court will apply the Law of England to those latter  conditions only in cases in which they consider that, in accordance with  the principles of Private International Law, the English system is  applicable--the presumption now being that, as a general rule, it is not  applicable.    [Illustration: Photo: Russell, London.    RIGHT HON. SIR J. GORDON SPRIGG, K.C.M.G.,    Prime Minister of Cape Colony.]    As regards the capacity of adults to enter into and be bound by  contract, the most striking difference between the English and Roman  Dutch systems is the survival, under the latter, of a modified form of  the Roman Interdiction of the Prodigal. Under certain circumstances, on  application of friends or relatives, such an order can issue. Again,  contracts of service made out of South Africa are not binding unless  entered into again before a public official in South Africa.    In respect to the tenure of property, more especially of property in  land, the differences which exist are all in favour of Roman Dutch Law.  An admirable system of registering titles to land, whether of ownership  or mortgage, exists in South Africa, as on the Continent of Europe,  where that most valuable legacy from the Roman Empire has remained  unchanged in principle to our day. No tedious scrutiny of documents  attesting title to land is necessary, as it is in England. The official  register is sufficient proof of ownership. Transfer is rapid and  inexpensive. Again, unavoidable calamity, amounting to a condition of  impossibility of beneficial occupation, excuses from the necessity of  payment of rent of land. Such excuse is not known to the Law of England.    Unlike the Law of England, but like the Law of Scotland, desertion by  either party to a marriage furnishes ground for absolute divorce, with  right of re-marriage. The system, flowing directly from the Roman Law,  both in Scotland and South Africa, is understood to work satisfactorily,  comparatively few divorces being sought for.      II.--THE MODERN LAW OF SOUTH AFRICA    Leaving the general principles of the law affecting personal status,  family relations, and property rights, the difference between the Law of  England and that of South Africa practically disappears as regards  Europeans in social relations. In the whole field of Commercial Law, and  in that of the Law of Crimes and Punishments, the Law of England has  practically been adopted in all the States and Colonies. The origin of  this state of the law is, of course, to be found in the fact that the  Roman Law conceptions were out of harmony with modern commercial  conditions and the competition of the World Market; and also that their  code of Crimes and Punishments has become inappropriate to the later  forms of European civilisation.    Several features of South African legislation require more special  notice. The Transvaal Law may be taken as typical of that of the other  States, and political and economical conditions make the law of the late  Republics of most importance and interest to the British public. The  most salient topics are those dealt with by the Law of Mines, the law as  to the natives, and the Law of Universal Military Service.    The law as to minerals, including not alone gold and silver, but all  precious metals and precious stones, is based on State ownership. It is  expressly declared: \"The right of mining for and disposal of all  precious stones and precious metals belongs to the State.\"    The State, however, does not undertake the work of mining, but grants,  under certain conditions, that privilege to various classes in the  community. The Government is authorised by law to proclaim a specified  area to be public \"diggings.\""]]]
