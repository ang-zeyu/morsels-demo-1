After the shock of their repulse by the Lancashire men of the 55th  Division they increased their strength of heavy artillery by three times  bringing up large numbers of howitzers, including eleven-inch monsters.  They were massed in divisions in front of us and determined to smash  through in the wake of a tremendous bombardment.      BRITISH UNDER FIRE    For five hours, as I said, this storm went on with high explosives and  gas, and the devoted British had to suffer this infernal thing, the  worst ordeal human beings may be called upon to bear, this standing to  while all the earth upheaved and the air was thick with shell splinters.    But when the bombardment had passed and the German infantry came forward  the British received them with blasts of machine-gun fire, incessant  volleys of rifle fire, and a trench mortar bombardment that burst with  the deadliest effect among the attacking troops.    This trench mortar barrage of the British was one of the most awful  means of slaughter yesterday, especially when the enemy tried to cross  La Bassee Canal further north, and in that sector the infantry and  gunner officers say more Germans were killed yesterday along the canal  bank than on any other day since the fighting in this neighborhood. One  battery of trench mortars did most deadly execution until their pits  were surrounded, and only two of their crews were able to escape.    The machine gunners fought out in the open after some of their positions  had been wiped out by gunfire, caught the enemy waves at fifty yards'  range, and mowed them down; but the enemy was not checked for a long  time, despite his losses, and when one body fell another came up to fill  its place and press on into any gap that had been made by their  artillery or their own machine-gun sections.    There was one such momentary gap between a body of the Black Watch, who  had been weakened by shellfire, and some of their comrades further  north, and into this the enemy tried to force a way. Other Scottish  troops were in reserve, and when it became clear that a portion of the  line was endangered by this turning movement they came forward with grim  intent, and by a fierce counterattack swept through the gap and flung  back the enemy, so that the position was restored.    Further north some Gloucesters were fighting the enemy both ways, as  once before in history, when they fought back to back, thereby winning  the honor of wearing their cap badge back and front, which they do to  this day. The Germans had worked behind them as well as in front of  them, and they were in a tight corner, but did not yield, and finally,  after hard fighting, cleared the ground about them.    Meanwhile further south some Lancashire troops on the canal lost some  parts of their front line under an intense bombardment, but still fought  on in the open, repulsing every effort to drive them back and smashing  the enemy out of their positions, so that only remnants of the German  outposts clung on until late last night, up to which time there was  savage strife on both sides.      FIGHTING FOR THE CANAL    Extraordinary scenes took place on the canal bank when the enemy tried  to cross. In the twilight of early dawn a party came out of a wood and  tried to get across the water, but was seen by the British machine  gunners and shot down.    Then another body of men advanced and carried with them a floating  bridge, but when those who were not hit reached the water's edge they  found the bridge as fixed did not reach to the other side. Some of them  walked on it, expecting perhaps to jump the gap, but were shot off, and  other men on the bank also were caught under British fire.    A Corporal went down to the canal edge and flung hand grenades at the  Germans still struggling to fix the bridge, and then a Lieutenant and a  few men rushed down and pulled the bridge on to their side of the bank.    Later this young officer saw one of the British pontoons drifting down  and swam to it and made it fast beyond the enemy's reach, but in a  position so that some of his men ran across and caught the enemy under  their fire on his side of the canal.    At 7 o'clock yesterday morning, while a handkerchief was hoisted by the  enemy, three hundred of them made signs of surrender. Some of them  changed their minds at the last moment and ran away, but 150 gave  themselves up, and some of them swam the canal in order to reach our  side for this purpose. They were shivering in their wet clothes and in  the northeast wind, which lashed over the battle lines yesterday, and  they were very miserable men.      THE BELGIAN VICTORY    _Mr. Gibbs declares that had the Germans been able to pass Givenchy or  cross the canal north of Bethune on the 18th and 19th the result would  have proved disastrous. He gives credit for the repulse to the British  and French combined lines. He thus describes the achievement of the  Belgians on April 17_:    The Germans on the 17th pressed the attack in force against the  Belgians. Besides three regiments of the 1st Landwehr Division usually  holding this sector, between the Ypres-Staden railway and Kippe, they  brought up from Dixmude--poor Dixmude, into whose flaming ruins I went  when it was first bombarded in October, 1914--two regiments of the 6th  Bavarian Division, and from the coast the 5th Matrosen Regiment of the  2d Naval Division, with a regiment of the 58th Saxons. It was a heavy  force, and they hoped to surprise and annihilate the Belgian resistance  by their weight and quickness of attack.    The Belgians were waiting for them, standing, too, in those swampy  fields which they have held against the enemy for three and a half  years, always shelled, always paying daily a toll of life and limb, not  getting much glory or recognition because of the great battles  elsewhere, but patient and enduring as when I knew them on the Yser in  the first dreadful Winter of the war, and their little regular army  fought to a finish.    Even before the battle the German marines, Saxon troops, and Landwehr  suffered misery and lost many men. They lay out in the flat, wet fields  two nights previously, and were very cold, and scared by the Belgian  gunfire which burst among them. They had no great artillery behind them,  and the Saxons and German sailors now prisoners of the Belgians curse  bitterly because they were expected to get through easily in spite of  this.      Germans Cut Off    The enemy's intention was to take Bixschoote and advance across the Yser  Canal, driving south to Poperinghe. What they did by their massed  attacks was to penetrate to a point near Hoekske, southeast of Merckem,  the main weight of their pressure being directed along the Bixschoote  road. The Belgians delivered a quick counterattack, with wonderful  enthusiasm among officers and men. They had perfect knowledge of the  country, and used this fully by striking up from a place called Luyghem  in such a way that the enemy was driven toward the swamp, where any who  went in sank up to his neck in the ice-cold water.    The Germans were cut off from their own lines and trapped. Seven hundred  of them surrendered, men of all the regiments I have mentioned, and they  seemed to think themselves lucky at getting off so cheaply, though they  quailed when they were brought back through the towns behind the lines,  and the Belgian women, remembering many things, raised a cry as these  men passed. It was not a pleasant sound. I heard it once in France when  a German officer passed through with an escort. It was a cry which made  my blood run cold. But there is gladness among the Belgian troops, for  they had long waited for their chance of striking, and made good.      Heroism of the Doctors    As heroic a story as anything in all this history of the last four weeks  is that of the medical officers, nurses, orderlies, and ambulance men  belonging to these casualty clearing stations, who were not far behind  the fighting lines when the battle began on March 21.    And then in a few hours they were on the very edge of the enemy's  advancing tide, so that they were almost caught by it and had to make  brave efforts to rescue the wounded, save their equipment, and get away  to a place where for a little while again they could go on with their  noble work until the red edge of war swept up with its fire again and  they had to retreat still further.    I used to pass very often the outer ring of those casualty clearing  stations on the right of the British line beyond Bapaume, in the Cambrai  salient, and away toward St. Quentin.    They were almost caught on that day of March 21 when the infernal  bombardment was flung over a wide belt of the British lines, and the  enemy stormed the defenses and the British fought back in heroic  rearguard actions. It became a question of only a few hours, sometimes  of the last quarter of an hour, when these brave medical officers with  the nurses and orderlies could get away.    It is always the rule of patients first, and at Ham there were 1,200  wounded, and many others in other places. The railways were choked with  military transport or destroyed by shellfire. On the roads refugees were  mixed up with the transport and guns and troops. It was a frightful  problem, but the medical staffs did not lose their nerve, and set about  the business of removal with fine skill and discipline.      Caring for the Wounded    What wounded could walk were gathered together and sent on to the roads  to make their way back as far as their strength would carry them. The  badly wounded were packed into all the available ambulances and sent  away. The equipment had sometimes to be put on any train, regardless of  its destination. It was gathered in afterward from whatever place it  went to.    A casualty clearing station of 1,000 beds needs 100 lorries to move it,  but nine lorries take a full kit for 200 beds, and always"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41481"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science January 1930 (#8)"],[1,"been able to  judge from comparative anatomy, a fresh swarm emerges. See!\"    He pointed to the pupa he had unearthed, which, as if stirred into  activity by his handling, was now beginning to move. Or, rather,  something was moving inside the cocoon.    The shell broke, and the hideous head and folded antenna of a beetle  appeared. With a convulsive writhing, the monster threw off the covering  and stepped out. It extended its wings, glistening, with moisture, from  the still soft and pliant carapace, or shell, and suddenly zoomed off  into the distance.           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy shuddered as the boom of its flight grew softer and subsided.    \"Any day now the entire swarm will emerge,\" cried Bram. \"How many  moultings they undergo before they undergo the finished state, I do not  know, but already, as you see, they are prepared for the battle of  life. They emerge ravenous. That beetle will fall upon the man-herds and  devour a full grown man, unless the guards destroy it.\"    He raised his arms with the gesture of an ancient prophet. \"Woe to the  human race,\" he cried, \"the wretched ape spawn that has cast out its  teachers and persecuted those who sought to raise it to higher things!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy knew that Bram was referring to himself. Bram turned fiercely upon  Dodd.    \"When I joined the Greystoke expedition,\" he cried, \"it was with the  express intention of refuting your miserable theories as to the fossil  monotremes. I could not sleep or eat, so deeply was I affronted by them.  For, if they were true, the dasyuridae are an innovation in the great  scheme of nature, and man, instead of being a mere afterthought, a jest  of the Creative Force, came to earth with a purpose.    \"That I deny,\" he yelled. \"Man is a joke. Nature made him when she was  tired, as the architect of a cathedral fashions a gargoyle in a sportive  moment. It is the insect, not man, who is the predestined lord of the  ages!\"    And for once in his life, perhaps because at this point Tommy dug him  violently in the ribs, Dodd had the sense to remain silent. Bram led the  way swiftly back into the larger cave.    \"When this swarm hatches out,\" he said, \"I calculate that there will be  a trillion beetles seeking food. There is no food for a tithe of them  here underneath the earth. What then? Do you realize their stupendous  power, their invincibility?    \"No, you don't realize it, because your minds, through long habit, are  only attuned to think in terms of man. All man's long history of  slaughter of the so-called lower creatures obsesses you, blinds your  understanding. A beetle? Something to be trodden underfoot, crushed in  sport! But I tell you, gentlemen, that nature--God, if you will--has  designed to supplant the man-ape by the beetle.    \"He has resolved to throw down the wretched so-called intelligence of  your kind and mine, and supplant it by the divine instinct of the  beetle, an instinct that is infinitely superior, because it arrives at  results instantaneously. It knows where man infers. Attuned closely to  nature, it alone is able to fulfil the divine plan of Creation.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Bram was certainly under the influence of his drug; nevertheless, so  violent were his gestures, so inspired was his utterance, that Tommy and  Dodd listened almost in awe.    \"They are invincible,\" Bram went on. \"Their fecundity is such that when  the new swarm is hatched out their numbers alone will make them  irresistible. They do not know fear. They shrink from nothing. And they  will follow me, their leader--I, who know the means of controlling them.  How, then, can puny man hope to stand against them?    \"Join me, gentlemen,\" Bram went on. \"And beware how you decide rashly.  For this is the supreme moment, not only of your own lives, but for all  humanity and beetledom. Upon your decision hangs the future of the  world.    \"For, irresistible as the beetles are, there is one thing they lack. That  is the sense of historic continuity. If they destroy man, they will know  nothing of man's achievements, poor though these are. My own work on the  fossil monotremes--\"    \"Which is a tissue of inaccuracies and half-baked deductions!\" shouted  Dodd.    Bram started as if a whip had lashed him. \"Liar!\" he bawled. \"Do you  think that I, who left the Greystoke expedition in a howling blizzard  because I knew that here, in the inner earth, I could refute your  miserable impostures--do you think that I am in the mood to listen to  your wretched farrago of impossibilities?\"    \"Listen to me,\" bawled Dodd, advancing with waving arms. \"Once and for  all, let me tell you that your deductions are all based upon fallacious  premises. No, I will not shut up, Tom Travers! You want me to aid your  damned beetles in the destruction of humanity! I tell you that your  phascalotherium, amphitherium, and all the rest of them, including the  marsupial lion, are degenerate developments of the age following the  pleistocene. I say the whole insect world was made to fertilize the  plant world, so that it should bear fruit for human food. Man is the  summit of the scale of evolution, and I will never join in any infamous  scheme for his destruction.\"    Bram glared at Dodd like a madman. Three times he opened his mouth to  speak, but only inarticulate sounds came from his throat. And when at  last he did speak, he said something that neither Dodd nor Tommy had  anticipated.    \"It looks as if you're not so paralysed as you made out,\" he sneered.  \"You'll change your mind within what used to be called a day, Dodd.  You'll crawl to my feet and beg for pardon. And you'll recant your lying  theories about the fossil monotremes, or you die--the pair of you--you  die!\"          CHAPTER VI    _Escape!_      \"I heard what he said. You shall not die. We shall go away to your  place, where there are no beetles to eat us, even if\"--Haidia  shuddered--\"even if we have to cross the bridge of fire, beyond which,  they tell me, lies freedom.\"    High over and a little to one side of the petrol flame Dodd and Tommy  had seen the slender arch of rock leading into another cleft in the  rocks. They had investigated it several times, but always the fierce  heat had driven them back.    Both Dodd and Tommy had noticed, however, that at times the fire seemed  to shrink in volume and intensity. Observation had shown them that these  times were periodical, recurring about every twelve hours.    \"I think I've got the clue, Tommy,\" said Dodd, as the three watched the  fiery fountain and speculated on the possibility of escape. \"That flow  of petrol is controlled, like the tides on earth, by the pull of the  moon. Just now it is at its height. I've noticed that it loses pretty  nearly half its volume at its alternating phase. If I'm right, we'll  make the attempt in about twelve hours.\"    \"Bram's given us twenty-four,\" said Tommy. \"But how about getting Haidia  across?\"    \"I go where you go,\" said Haidia, sidling up to Dodd and looking down  upon him lovingly. \"I do not afraid of the fire. If it burn me up, I go  to the good place.\"    \"Where's that, Haidia?\" asked Dodd.    \"When we die, we go to a place where it is always dark and there are no  beetles, and the ground is full of shrimps. We leave our bodies behind,  like the beetles, and fly about happy for ever.\"    \"Not a bad sort of place,\" said Dodd, squeezing Haidia's arm. \"If you  think you're ready to try to cross the bridge, we'll start as soon as  the fire gets lower.\"    \"I'll be on the job,\" answered Haidia, unconsciously reproducing a  phrase of Tommy's.           *       *       *       *       *    The girl glided away, and disappeared through the thick of the beetle  crowd clustered about the entrance to the cavern. Tommy and Dodd had  already discovered that it was through her ability to reproduce a  certain beetle sound meaning \"not good to eat\" that the girl could come  and go. They had once tried it on their own account, and had narrowly  escaped the lashing tentacles.    After that there was nothing to do but wait. Three or four hours must  have passed when Bram returned from his inner cave.    \"Well, Dodd, have you experienced a change of heart?\" he sneered. \"If  you knew what's in store for you, maybe you'd come to the conclusion  that you've been too cocksure about the monotremes. We're slaughtering  in the morning.\"    \"That so?\" asked Dodd.    \"That's so,\" shouted Bram. \"The beetles are beginning to emerge from the  pupae, and they'll need food if they're to be kept quiet. We're rounding  up about threescore of the culls--your friend Haidia will be among them.  We've got some caged ichneumon flies, pretty little things only a foot  long, which will sting them in certain nerve centers, rendering them  powerless to move. Then we shall bury them, standing up, in the  vegetable mould, for the beetles to devour alive, as soon as they come  out of the shells. You'll feel pretty, Dodd, standing there unable to  move, with the new born beetles biting chunks out of you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy shuddered, despite his hopes of their escaping. Bram, for a  scientist, had a grim and picturesque imagination.    \"Dodd, there is no personal quarrel between us,\" Bram went on. Again  that note of pathetic pleading came into his voice. \"Give up your mad  ideas. Admit that the banded ant-eater, at least, existed before the  pleistocene epoch, and everything can be settled. When you see what my  beetles are going to do to humanity, you'll be proud to join us. Only  make a beginning. You remember the point I made in my paper, about  spalacotherium in the Upper Jurassic rocks. It would convince anybody  but a hardened fanatic.\"    \"I read your paper, and I saw your so-called spalacotherium,  reconstructed from what you called a jaw-bone,\" shouted Dodd. \"That  so-called jaw-bone was a lump of chalk,"]]]
