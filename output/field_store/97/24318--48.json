These curious organs  communicate with other vessels, and, as we have previously stated, are  probably connected with respiration and excretion.    [Illustration: Paramecium aurelia. A dried specimen showing the  vesicles.--_Pritchard._]    The genus _Paramecium_ is now confined to those creatures which exhibit  rows of longitudinal cilia of uniform length, which are destitute of  hooks, styles, or other organs of motion than the cilia, which have a  lateral mouth, and no eye-spots. One mode of increase is by division,  which may be easily observed; another is through the formation of true  eggs as traced by Balbiani.    Another of the treasures from the pond was a species of _Trachelius_, or  long-necked ciliated animalcule, which kept darting in and out of a  slimy den, attached to the leaf of a water-plant. The body was stout and  fish-shaped, the tail blunt, and the neck furnished with long  conspicuous cilia, which enabled the advancing and retreating movements  to be made with great rapidity. The motions of this creature exhibit  more appearance of purpose and design than is common with animalcules,  but in proportion as these observations are prolonged, the student will  be impressed with the difficulty of assuming that anything like a  reasoning faculty and volition, is proved by movements that bear some  resemblance to those of higher animals, whose cerebral capacities are  beyond a doubt. It is, however, almost impossible to witness motions  which are neither constant nor periodic, without fancying them to be  dictated by some sort of intelligence. We must, nevertheless, be  cautious, lest we allow ourselves to be deceived by reasoning so  seductive, as the vital operations of the lowest organisms may be merely  illustrations of blind obedience to stimuli, in which category we must  reckon food, and until we arrive at forms of being which clearly possess  a ganglionic system, we have no certainty that a real will exists, even  of the simplest kind; and perhaps we must go still higher before we  ought to believe in its presence.    Ehrenberg was much struck with the restless character of many  infusoria--whether he looked at them by day or by night, they were never  still. In fact their motions are like the involuntary actions which take  place in the human frame; and if attached to their bodies we observe  cilia that never sleep, the living membrane of some of our own organs,  the nose, for example, is similarly ciliated, and keeps up a perpetual  though unconscious work.

The _Paramecia_, noticed in the last chapter, have increased and  multiplied their kind without any fear lest the due adjustment between  population and food should fail to be preserved. A small drop of the  scum from the surface of the water in their bottle is an astounding  sight. They move hither and thither in countless numbers, seldom  jostling, although thick as herrings in a tub, and in many portions of  the field the process of self-fissure, or multiplication by division, is  going on without any symptoms of discomfort on the part of the parent  creature. This is an interesting sight, but we will not linger over it,  for the sun is shining, and there is enough warmth in the air to make it  probable that the ponds will be more prolific than in the cold winter  months. Sunshine is a great thing for the microscopic hunter; it brings  swarms of creatures to the surface, and the Rotifers are especially fond  of its genial beams. Even if we imitate it by a bright lamp, we shall  attract crowds of live dancing specks to the illuminated side of a  bottle, and may thus easily effect their capture by the dipping-tube.    [Illustration: Pterodina patina.]    This year the March sunshine was not lost, for on the third of that  month I obtained a bottleful of conferva from a pond about a mile from  my house, and lying at the foot of the Highgate hills. Water-fleas were  immediately discovered in abundance, together with some minute worms,  and a ferocious-looking larva covered with scales; but what attracted  most attention was a Rotifer, like a transparent animated soup-plate,  from near the middle of which depended a tail, which swayed from side to  side, as the creature swam along. The head exhibited two little red  eyes; two tufts of cilia rowed the living disk through the water, and  the gizzard worked with a rapid snapping motion, that left no doubt the  ciliary whirlpools had brought home no slender stores of invisible food.  Sometimes the end of the tail acted as a sucker, and fixed the animal  tightly to the glass, when the wheels were protruded, and the body  swayed to and fro. Then the sucker action ceased, and as the creature  swam away, a tuft of cilia was thrust out from the extremity of the  tail. A power of one hundred linear was sufficient to enable the general  nature of this beautiful object to be observed, but to bring out the  details, much greater amplification was required, and this would be  useless if the little fidget could not be kept still.    [Illustration: Pterodina patina--gizzard.]    The size of the creature, whose name we may as well mention was  _Pterodina patina_, rendered this practicable, but required some care.  The longest diameter of the body, which was not quite round, was about  1--120\", so that it was visible to the naked eye, and as a good many  were swimming together, one could be captured without much difficulty,  and transferred with a very small drop of water to the live-box. Then  the cover had to be put on so as to squeeze the animal just enough to  keep it still without doing it any damage, or completely stopping its  motions. This was a troublesome task, and often a little overpressure  prevented its success.    Some observers always use in these cases an instrument called a  _compressorium_, by which the amount of pressure is regulated by a lever  or a fine screw; but whether the student possess one or not, he should  learn to accomplish the same result by dexterously manipulating a  well-made live-box. We will suppose the _Pterodina_ successfully caged,  and a power of about one hundred and fifty linear brought to bear upon  her, for our specimen is of the \"female persuasion.\" This will suffice  to demonstrate the disposition and relation of the several parts, after  which one of from four hundred to five hundred linear may be used with  great advantage, though in this case the illumination must be carefully  adjusted, and its intensity and obliquity frequently changed, until the  best effect is obtained.    We find, on thus viewing the Pterodina, that it is a complex, highly  organized creature, having its body protected by a _carapace_, like the  shell of a tortoise, but as flexible as a sheet of white gelatine paper,  which it resembles in appearance. Round the margin of this carapace are  a number of little bosses or dots, which vary in different individuals.  The cilia are not disposed, as at first appeared, in two separate and  distinct disks, but are continuous, as in the annexed sketch. Down each  side are two long muscular bands, distinctly _striated_, and when they  contract, the ciliary apparatus is drawn in. As this contraction takes  place, two apparently elastic bands, to which the ciliary lobes are  attached, are bent downwards, till they look like the C springs behind a  gentleman's carriage; and they regain their former position of slight  curvature, when the cilia are again thrust out.    [Illustration: Pterodina patina--tail-foot.]    The gizzard is three-lobed, and curiously grasped by forked expansions  of the handles of the hammers. The tail, or tail-foot, can be withdrawn  or thrust out at the will of the creature; and when in a good position  for observation, a slight additional pressure will keep it so for  examination. Delicate muscular longitudinal bands, forked towards the  end of their course, supply the means of performing some of its motions,  and one, or perhaps two, spiral threads extend through the upper half of  its length, and either act as muscles, or as elastic springs for its  extension. The intestines and other viscera are clearly exhibited, and a  strong ciliary action conducts the food to the gizzard-mouth.    To return to the tail. One spiral fibre is easily discovered; but I  have often, and at an interval of months, seen the appearance of two,  and am in some doubt whether this was a deception, arising from the  compression employed, or was a genuine indication.    [Illustration: A. Metopidia acuminata, as drawn by Mr. Gosse. B.  Specimen as seen and described in text. _c._ Mouth or gizzard.]    Where this Rotifer occurs I have usually found it plentiful, but  unfortunately could obtain no constant supplies after I had determined  to make a special study of the remarkable tail, which is much more  complicated than I have described. The _Pterodina_ lived for some time  in captivity, and for a week or two I could obtain them from my glass  tank. They were likewise to be found for some weeks in the same part of  the pond, but not all over it, until one day not a single specimen could  be discovered, notwithstanding a persevering search nor was I  afterwards able to get any from that pond during the remainder of the  year.    [Illustration: Trichodina pediculus.]    Several other Rotifers, with and without carapaces, were among the same  mass of confervae, among them a _Metopidia_, with a firm shell, a forked  jointed tail, and a projection in front which worked like a pickaxe  among the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36922"],[0,"Antarctic Penguins: A Study of Their Social Habits (#8)"],[1,"heap amongst natural  black ones near a nest-covered knoll. Returning in a few hours I found  nearly all the red stones and one or two of the green ones gone, and  later found them in nests. Later still, all the red ones had  disappeared, and last of all the green ones. I traced nearly all these  to nests, and found a few days later that, like the pieces of white  quartz, they were being stolen from nest to nest and thus slowly being  distributed in different directions. At other times I saw pieces of tin,  pieces of glass, half a stick of chocolate, and the head of a bright  metal teaspoon in different nests near our hut, the articles evidently  having been taken from our scrap-heap. Thus it is evident that penguins  like bright colours and prefer red to green, as instanced by the  selection of the coloured pebbles. I am sorry that I did not carry these  colour tests further.    During October 29 the stream of arrivals was undiminished, but the next  day it slackened considerably, and during the next two days stopped  altogether, all the rising ground of the rookery now being literally  crammed full with nests, several thousands of them being scattered up  the slopes of Cape Adare to a height of a thousand feet.      [Illustration: Fig. 31. Showing the Position of the Two Eggs]      [Illustration: Fig. 32. An Adelie in \"Ecstatic\" Attitude (Page 47)]          PART II      DOMESTIC LIFE OF THE ADELIE PENGUIN    Laying and incubation of the eggs : The Adelies' habits in the water :  Their games : Care of the young : The later development of their social  system.    On November 3 several eggs were found, and on the 4th these were  beginning to be plentiful in places, though many of the colonies had not  yet started to lay.    Let me here call attention to the fact that up to now not a single bird  out of all those thousands had left the rookery once it had entered it.  Consequently not a single bird had taken food of any description during  all the most strenuous part of the breeding season, and as they did not  start to feed till November 8 thousands had to my knowledge fasted for  no fewer than twenty-seven days. Now of all the days of the year these  twenty-seven are certainly the most trying during the life of the  Adelie.    With the exception, in some cases, of a few hours immediately after  arrival (and I believe the later arrivals could not afford themselves  even this short respite) constant vigilance had been maintained; battle  after battle had been fought; some had been nearly killed in savage  encounters, recovered, fought again and again with varying fortune. They  had mated at last, built their nests, procreated their species, and, in  short, met the severest trials that Nature can inflict upon mind and  body, and at the end of it, though in many cases blood-stained and in  all caked and bedraggled with mire, they were as active and as brave as  ever.    When one egg had been laid the hen still sat on the nest. The egg had to  be continually warmed, and as the temperature was well below  freezing-point, exposure would mean the death of the embryo.    In order to determine the period between the laying of the two eggs, I  numbered seven nests with wooden pegs, writing on the pegs the date on  which each egg was laid. The result obtained is shown on page 53.    The average interval in the four cases where two eggs were laid being  3.5 days.      [Illustration: Fig. 33. Floods (Page 66)]    No. 7 nest was that of the hen which I mentioned as having waited for so  long for a mate, and the lateness of the date on which the first egg  appeared may have resulted in there being no other.      +------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+    |            |    Date of   |    Date of    |             |    |            |  appearance  |   appearance  |   Interval  |    |            | of first egg | of second egg |             |    +------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+    | No. 1 nest |    Nov. 14   |       --      | Only 1 laid |    |            |              |               |             |    | No. 2 nest |    Nov. 13   |    Nov. 16    |    3 days   |    |            |              |               |             |    | No. 3 nest |    Nov. 14   |    Nov. 17    |    3 days   |    |            |              |               |             |    | No. 4 nest |              |               |             |    |            |              |               |             |    | No. 5 nest |    Nov. 12   |    Nov. 16    |    4 days   |    |            |              |               |             |    | No. 6 nest |    Nov.  8   |    Nov. 12    |    4 days   |    |            |              |               |             |    | No. 7 nest |    Nov. 24   |       --      | Only 1 laid |    +------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+    The only notes I have on the incubation period are that the first chick  appeared in No. 5 nest on December 19 (incubation period thirty-seven  days) and in No. 7 nest on December 28 (incubation period thirty-four  days).    The skuas had increased considerably in numbers by November 4, and  frequently came to the scrap-heap outside our hut. Here were many frozen  carcasses of penguins which we had thrown there after the breasts had  been removed for food during the past winter. The skuas picked the bones  quite clean of flesh, so that the skeletons lay white under the skins,  and it was remarkable to what distances they sometimes carried the  carcasses, which weighed considerably more than the skuas themselves. I  found some of these bodies over five hundred yards away.    A perpetual feud was carried on between the penguins and the skuas. The  latter birds come to the south in the summer, and make their nests close  to, and in some cases actually among, those of the penguins, and during  the breeding time live almost entirely on the eggs, and later, on the  chicks. They never attack the adult penguins, who run at them and drive  them away when they light within reach, but as the skuas can take to the  wing and the penguins cannot, no pursuit is possible.      [Illustration: Fig. 34. Flooded]      [Illustration: Fig. 35. A Nest with Stones of Mixed Sizes]    The skuas fly about over the rookery, keeping only a few yards from the  ground, and should one of them see a nest vacated and the eggs exposed,  if only for a few seconds, it swoops at this, and with scarcely a pause  in its flight, picks up an egg in its beak and carries it to an open  space on the ground, there to devour the contents. Here then was another  need for constant vigilance, and so daring did the skuas become, that  often when a penguin sat on a nest carelessly, so as to leave one of the  eggs protruding from under it, a lightning dash from a skua would result  in the egg being borne triumphantly away.    The bitterness of the penguins' hatred of the skuas was well shown in  the neighbourhood of our scrap-heap. None of the food thrown out on to  this heap was of the least use to the penguins, but we noticed after a  time that almost always there were one or more penguins there, keeping  guard against the skuas, and doing their utmost to prevent them from  getting the food, and never allowing them to light on the heap for more  than a few seconds at a time. In fact, a constant feature of this heap  was the sentry penguin, darting hither and thither, aiming savage pecks  at the skuas, which would then rise a yard or two into the air out of  reach, the penguin squalling in its anger at being unable to follow its  enemy. At this juncture the penguin would imitate the flying motion with  its flappers, seeming instinctively to attempt to mount into the air, as  its remote ancestors doubtlessly did, before their wings had adapted  themselves solely to swimming.    Close to the scrap-heap there was a large knoll crowded with penguins'  nests, and it was this knoll that provided the sentries. Very rarely did  one of these leave the heap until another came to relieve it as long as  there were skuas about, but when the skuas went the penguins left it  too. When the skuas returned, however, and without the lapse of a few  seconds, a penguin would be seen to detach itself from the knoll and run  to guard the heap. That some primitive understanding on this matter  existed among the penguins seems to me probable, because whilst there  were generally one or two guarding the heap, there was never a crowd,  the rest of the knoll seeming quite satisfied as long as one of their  number remained on guard.    In describing the Cape Adare rookery I mentioned the fact that the  pebbles entering into the formation of the beach are basaltic, and  therefore of a dead black shade. The result of this is that as the sun's  altitude increases, heat is absorbed readily by the black rock, through  that clear atmosphere, and the snow upon it rapidly melts.      [Illustration: Fig. 36. \"HOUR AFTER HOUR, DURING THE WHOLE DAY, THEY    FOUGHT AGAIN AND AGAIN\" (Page 68)]    For a long time the penguins at their nests had satisfied their thirst  by eating the snow near them, but as this disappeared, they suffered  greatly, as was made evident by the way they lay with beaks open and  tongues exposed between them. (Fig. 30.) As time went on the cocks  started to make short journeys to the drifts which still remained in  order to quench their thirst, but the hens stuck manfully, or rather  \"henfully\" to their posts, though some of them seemed much distressed.  Later, those cocks which had nested in the centre of the rookery had  quite long journeys to make in order to find drifts, a very popular  resort being that which had formed in the lee of our hut, and all day  streams of them came here to gobble snow. Once a cock was seen to take a  lump of snow in his beak and carry it to his mate on the nest, who ate  it.    Mr. Priestley tells me that when he was at Cape Royds in 1908 he saw  cocks taking snow to hens on"]]]
