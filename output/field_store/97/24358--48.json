He told me one day when I drew him into talk that he had a  nephew, Angel Ganivet, roaming in foreign lands. 'But he does not  forget his old uncle,' said he. 'I always receive my little pension  prompt to the day, and so I like to look at the foreign shields about  the city, and remember my nephew, far away, who remembers me.' That  was a trifle, of course, but it gave me a kindly feeling for the young  fellow, and I'm sorry he came to such an end. They found him in the  river, you know. I dare say it was suicide, and likely enough the  defeat of Spain had its share in causing his despondency; but nobody  knows. He was a zealous patriot, I understand, and all Granada seems  to take his death to heart.\"    My next authority was an aged Granadine, a man of letters; but he had  not read Ganivet's books.    \"I have heard of him often,\" he said, \"but I never met him. He was not  much in Granada, although he seems to have had a romantic affection  for the place. _Bueno!_ Its pomegranates are worth remembering. But  Ganivet liked to live in foreign countries, with the idea of  understanding his own better by comparison. He was young; he still had  hopes for Spain. Eighty years are on my head, and I have long done  with hoping. I have served in my country's armies, I have served in  her Government, I have seen much of Church and State, and since the  night when they murdered General Prim I have seen nothing good. But  Ganivet had faith in the national future, and the people, without  waiting to ask on what that faith was founded, love him for it, and  mourn his loss as if he had been their benefactor. They are all going  to pour into the theatre to-morrow night to hear his symbolic drama,  that not one in a hundred of them will try to understand, and the  hundredth will get it all wrong.\"    The \"function\" took place in the _Gran Teatro de Isabel la Catolica_,  a name to conjure with throughout all Spain, and especially in  Granada. The day set for the performance, and widely advertised by  newspapers and posters for a month in advance, was a Wednesday. On  Tuesday, in a fever lest we be too late, we arrived at the ticket  office. We had our hurry all to ourselves. Apparently nobody else had  as yet taken a seat. The office was empty, save for us and our  attendant train of boys and beggars.    The official in charge, deaf, slow, and courteous, invited us into a  private room and gave us rocking-chairs by the _brasero_, while he,  with paper and pencil, laboriously added the price of our _entradas_  to the price of our modest box, and spent five minutes in subtracting  the amount from the figure of the small bill we handed him. The  counting out of the change was another strain on his arithmetic, and,  after all these toils, we were still without tickets. He said he would  \"write them out at home,\" and we might send some one for them the next  day. But he affably offered to show us the theatre, and led us through  black passages to a great dusky space, where, while he struck match  after match, we could catch glimpses of pit and balconies, and even a  far-off stage, with a group of actors gathered about a lamp,  rehearsing the play. In Wednesday morning's paper, however, they  announced with entire nonchalance that they were not ready yet, and  would postpone the representation until Thursday.    On Thursday evening the theatre, choking full though it was, hardly  presented a brilliant appearance. Granada is not Madrid, nor Seville,  and the best the Granadines had to offer their dead poet was the  tribute of their presence in such guise as they could command. The  big, barnlike theatre, with its rows of broken lamp-chimneys, looked  shabby, and the rag-tag proportion of the audience was so great that  it overflowed the _Paraiso_ into the aisles and doorways and all  conceivable corners. People were so jumbled and crumpled together  that, with reminiscences of my traveller's hold-all, I found myself  wondering if they would ever shake out smooth again.    Whole families were there, from the infant in arms that invariably  screamed when the actors were reciting any passage of peculiar  delicacy, to the dozing old grandfather, who kept dropping his  cigarette out of his mouth in a way that threatened to set us all on  fire. The gentlemen, even in the boxes and the stalls, were generally  ungloved, and we did not see a dress suit in the house. Cloaks and  neckties were ablaze with color as usual, but the masculine toilets  eluded our stricter observation; for when the curtain was up, our eyes  were all for the stage, and between acts your Spaniard sits with hat  on head, enveloped in a cloud of tobacco smoke.    But the Andalusian ladies made amends for everything. By some  prehistoric agreement, Spanish women have yielded the rainbow to the  men, reserving for their own attire the quiet elegance of black or the  festive beauty of pure white. The dress that evening, even in the  principal boxes, was conspicuously simple. But the clear brunette  complexions, the delicate contours, the rich black hair worn high and  crowned with natural flowers, the waving fans and flashing glances,  cast a glamour over the whole scene.    The memorial rites themselves made up in quantity whatever they might  lack in quality, continuing from eight o'clock till two. An orchestra,  organized from Granada musicians for this occasion, opened the  programme. The bust of Ganivet, wrought by a young Granada sculptor,  was reverently unveiled. The star actor, Fuentes of Granada, who had  undertaken with his troupe to present his fellow-townsman's drama  purely as a labor of love, read an interpretation written by one of  Granada's leading critics. The orchestra was in evidence again,  introducing the first act, entitled \"Faith.\" After this the orchestra  played Breton's serenade, \"In the Alhambra,\" and the curtain rose for  the second act on so natural a scene-painting of the famous fortress  that the audience went wild with enthusiasm, and the blushing artist,  also a Granadine, had to be literally shoved from the wings upon the  stage to receive his plaudits.    Between the second act, \"Love,\" and the last act, \"Death,\" came an  _andante elegiaco_, \"written expressly for this artistic solemnity\" by  a Granada composer. Here, again, the appreciation of the audience was  unbounded, and nothing would do but the reluctant master must leave  his box, struggle through the packed multitude to the conductor's  stand, and take the baton himself for a second rendering from the  first chord to the last. At the close of the third act the orchestra  did its part once more, and the celebration ended, somewhat  incongruously, with a lively bit of modern comedy.    There was imperfection enough, had one been disposed to look for it.  The fifty members of the impromptu orchestra had hardly brought  themselves into accord, the acting was not of the best Spanish  quality, and the players had not half learned their parts. Every long  declamation was a duet, the prompter's rapid undertone charging along  beneath the actor's voice like a horse beneath its rider. But the  audience understood, forgave, were grateful, and sat with sublime  patience through the long pauses between the acts, repeating one to  another, \"They say Fuentes is studying his speeches.\" As the caustic  old scholar had predicted, most of them, apparently, did not try to  understand the allegory. They applauded the obviously poetic touches,  the palpably dramatic situations, and when, in the Alhambra act, a  gypsy air was sung, the galleries delightedly caught it up and  chorused it over again.    But in general that nondescript assembly looked on in passive gravity  while _El Escultor de su Alma_ was rendered, as their poet had  bidden, in their own theatre and for them. They may have gathered  hints and snatches of that mystical message from the dead, whose lofty  look, fixed in shining marble, dominated all the house.    The restless Spirit of Man, seeking the perfect Truth, tears himself  loose from the bride of his youth, Heavenly Faith, and wanders in  beggary through the world. Yet Truth for him can only be the child of  his union with Faith, and in parting from one he has parted from both.  In old age, almost maddened by his wanderings and woes, he meets his  Truth again, full-grown and beautiful, but is so fierce and wild in  his desire to possess her that only Death can reconcile them--Death  and that Heavenly Faith who could not abandon him, though he had  forsaken her.    Ganivet's mother, who, with his brothers, witnessed the play from  behind the scenes, is said to have rejoiced in it as a last solemn  assurance from her son of his secure repose in the Catholic faith of  his fathers. It may not have meant so much to that great audience,  many of whom could neither read nor write, but those tiers upon tiers  of dark Spanish faces were full of earnestness and of a proud content.  However it may have baffled their heads, this legacy of a play, in its  Alhambra setting, spoke clearly to their hearts. One ragamuffin said  to another, as an all-sufficient criticism, \"He was thinking of  Granada when he wrote it.\"    A few days later, I found and eagerly read Angel Ganivet's most  significant booklet, _Idearium_, published in the autumn of 1896, in  which he sets forth his dream for the future of his beloved country.    Ganivet claims that the deepest moral element in Spanish character is  stoicism, \"not the brutal and heroic stoicism of Cato, nor the serene  and majestic stoicism of Marcus Aurelius, nor the rigid and extreme  stoicism of Epictetus, but the natural and humane stoicism of Seneca.\"  He holds that Seneca,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#8)"],[1,"into the pitiful little face.    There had been no baby at The Place for many a year. Lad had seldom  seen one at such close quarters. But now the sight did something queer  to his heart--the big heart that ever went out to the weak and  defenseless, the heart that made a playfully snapping puppy or a  cranky little lapdog as safe from his terrible jaws as was Lady  herself.    He sniffed in friendly fashion at the child's pathetically upturned  face. Into the dull baby-eyes, at sight of him, came a look of pleased  interest--the first that had crossed their blankness for many a long  day. Two feeble little hands reached out and buried themselves  lovingly in the mass of soft ruff that circled Lad's neck.    The dog quivered all over, from nose to brush, with joy at the  touch. He laid his great head down beside the drawn cheek, and  positively reveled in the pain the tugging fingers were inflicting on  his sensitive throat.    In one instant, Lad had widened his narrow and hard-established circle  of Loved Ones, to include this half-dead wisp of humanity.    The child's mother came up the steps in the Master's wake. At sight of  the huge dog, she halted in quick alarm.    \"Look out!\" she shrilled. \"He may attack her! Oh, _do_ drive him  away!\"    \"Who? Lad,\" queried the Mistress. \"Why, Lad wouldn't harm a hair of  her head if his life depended on it! See, he adores her already. I  never knew him to take to a stranger before. And she looks brighter  and happier, too, than she has looked in months. Don't make her cry by  sending him away from her.\"    \"But,\" insisted the woman, \"dogs are full of germs. I've read so. He  might give her some terrible----\"    \"Lad is just as clean and as germless as I am,\" declared the Mistress,  with some warmth. \"There isn't a day he doesn't swim in the lake, and  there isn't a day I don't brush him. He's----\"    \"He's a collie, though,\" protested the guest, looking on in uneasy  distaste, while Baby secured a tighter and more painful grip on the  delighted dog's ruff. \"And I've always heard collies are awfully  treacherous. Don't you find them so?\"    \"If we did,\" put in the Master, who had heard that same asinine  question until it sickened him, \"if we found collies were treacherous,  we wouldn't keep them. A collie is either the best dog or the worst  dog on earth. Lad is the best. We don't keep the other kind. I'll call  him away, though, if it bothers you to have him so close to Baby.  Come, Lad!\"    Reluctantly, the dog turned to obey the Law; glancing back, as he  went, at the adorable new idol he had acquired; then crossing  obediently to where the Master stood.    The Baby's face puckered unhappily. Her pipestem arms went out toward  the collie. In a tired little voice she called after him:    \"Dog! _Doggie!_ Come back here, right away! I love you, Dog!\"    Lad, vibrating with eagerness, glanced up at the Master for leave to  answer the call. The Master, in turn, looked inquiringly at his  nervous guest. Lad translated the look. And, instantly, he felt an  unreasoning hate for the fussy woman.    The guest walked over to her weakly gesticulating daughter and  explained:    \"Dogs aren't nice pets for sick little girls, dear. They're rough;  and besides, they bite. I'll find Dolly for you as soon as I unpack:\"    \"Don't want Dolly,\" fretted the child. \"Want the dog! He isn't  rough. He won't bite. Doggie! I love you! Come _here!_\"    Lad looked up longingly at the Master, his plumed tail a-wag, his ears  up, his eyes dancing. One hand of the Master's stirred toward the  hammock in a motion so imperceptible that none but a sharply watchful  dog could have observed it.    Lad waited for no second bidding. Quietly, unobtrusively, he crossed  behind the guest, and stood beside his idol. The Baby fairly squealed  with rapture, and drew his silken head down to her face.    \"Oh, well!\" surrendered the guest, sulkily. \"If she won't be happy any  other way, let him go to her. I suppose it's safe, if you people say  so. And it's the first thing she's been interested in, since----_No_,  darling,\" she broke off, sternly. \"You shall _not_ kiss him! I draw  the line at that. Here! Let Mamma rub your lips with her handkerchief.\"    \"Dogs aren't made to be kissed,\" said the Master, sharing, however,  Lad's disgust at the lip-scrubbing process. \"But she'll come to less  harm from kissing the head of a clean dog than from kissing the mouths  of most humans. I'm glad she likes Lad. And I'm still gladder that he  likes her. It's almost the first time he ever went to an outsider of  his own accord.\"    That was how Lad's idolatry began. And that, too, was how a miserably  sick child found a new interest in life.    Every day, from morning to dusk, Lad was with the Baby. Forsaking his  immemorial \"cave\" under the music-room piano, he lay all night outside  the door of her bedroom. In preference even to a romp through the  forest with Lady, he would pace majestically alongside the invalid's  wheelchair as it was trundled along the walks or up and down the  veranda.    Forsaking his post on the floor at the left of the Master's seat, at  meals--a place that had been his alone since puppyhood--he lay always  behind the Baby's table couch. This to the vast discomfort of the maid  who had to step over him in circumnavigating the board, and to the  open annoyance of the child's mother.    Baby, as the days went on, lost none of her first pleasure in her  shaggy playmate. To her, the dog was a ceaseless novelty. She loved to  twist and braid the great white ruff on his chest, to toy with his  sensitive ears, to make him \"speak\" or shake hands or lie down or  stand up at her bidding. She loved to play a myriad of intricate  games with him--games ranging from _Beauty and the Beast_, to _Fairy  Princess and Dragon_.    Whether as _Beast_ (to her _Beauty_) or in the more complex and  exacting role of _Dragon_, Lad entered wholesouledly into every such  game. Of course, he always played his part wrong. Equally, of course,  Baby always lost her temper at his stupidity, and pummeled him, by way  of chastisement, with her nerveless fists--a punishment Lad accepted  with a grin of idiotic bliss.    Whether because of the keenly bracing mountain air or because of her  outdoor days with a chum who awoke her dormant interest in life, Baby  was growing stronger and less like a sallow ghostling. And, in the  relief of noting this steady improvement, her mother continued to  tolerate Lad's chumship with the child, although she had never lost  her own first unreasoning fear of the big dog.    Two or three things happened to revive this foolish dread. One of them  occurred about a week after the invalid's arrival at The Place.    Lady, being no fonder of guests than was Lad, had given the veranda  and the house itself a wide berth. But one day, as Baby lay in the  hammock (trying in a wordy irritation to teach Lad the alphabet), and  as the guest sat with her back to them, writing letters, Lady trotted  around the corner of the porch.    At sight of the hammock's queer occupant, she paused, and stood  blinking inquisitively. Baby spied the graceful gold-and-white  creature. Pushing Lad to one side, she called, imperiously:    \"Come here, new Doggie. You pretty, _pretty_ Doggie!\"    Lady, her vanity thus appealed to, strolled mincingly forward. Just  within arm's reach, she halted again. Baby thrust out one hand, and  seized her by the ruff to draw her into petting-distance.    The sudden tug on Lady's fur was as nothing to the haulings and  maulings in which Lad so meekly reveled. But Lad and Lady were by no  means alike, as I think I have said. Boundless patience and a  chivalrous love for the Weak, were not numbered among Lady's erratic  virtues. She liked liberties as little as did Lad; and she had a far  more drastic way of resenting them.    At the first pinch of her sensitive skin there was an instant flash of  gleaming teeth, accompanied by a nasty growl and a lightning-quick  forward lunge of the dainty gold-white head. As the wolf slashes at a  foe--and as no animals but wolf and collie know how to--Lady slashed  murderously at the thin little arm that sought to pull her along.    And Lad, in the same breath, hurled his great bulk between his mate  and his idol. It was a move unbelievably swift for so large a dog. And  it served its turn.    The eye-tooth slash that would have cut the little girl's arm to the  bone, sent a red furrow athwart Lad's massive shoulder.    Before Lady could snap again, or, indeed, could get over her surprise  at her mate's intervention, Lad was shouldering her off the edge of  the veranda steps. Very gently he did this, and with no show of  teeth. But he did it with much firmness.    In angry amazement at such rudeness on the part of her usually  subservient mate, Lady snarled ferociously, and bit at him.    Just then, the child's mother, roused from her letter-writing by the  turmoil, came rushing to her endangered offspring's rescue.    \"He growled at Baby,\" she reported hysterically, as the noise brought  the Master out of his study and to the veranda on the run. \"He  _growled_ at her, and then he and that other horrid brute got to  fighting, and----\"    \"Pardon me,\" interposed the Master, calling both dogs to him, \"but Man  is the only animal to maltreat the female of his kind. No male dog  would fight with Lady. Much less would Lad--Hello!\" he broke  off. \"Look at his shoulder, though! That was meant for Baby. Instead  of scolding Lad, you may thank him for saving her from an ugly slash.  I'll keep Lady chained up, after this.\"    \"But----\"    \"But, with Lad beside her, Baby is in just about as much danger as  she would be with a guard of forty U. S. Regulars,\" went on the  Master. \"Take my word for it. Come along, Lady. It's the kennel for  you for the next few weeks, old girl. Lad, when I get back, I'll wash  that shoulder for you.\"    With a sigh, Lad went over to"]]]
