It displays a striking union of that  beauty, grace, and expression, of which, in this school, he may be said  to have set the example. It would appear that he continued to employ his  talents to an extreme old age, there remaining, in the select gallery of  Santa Giustina, at Padua, one of his Madonnas, painted in 1516.[29] Such  figures, together with those of the Dead Christ, are the most frequent  paintings of his hand that we meet with. Should any one, not content  with the commendations I have bestowed, feel inclined to prefer a  Bellini to a Raffaello, because he was his superior in architectural  design, let him consult the opinion of Boschini, p. 28, of his _Carta da  Navigare_, but let him recollect that the same writer possesses nothing  of the poet beyond the measure of the verse, and the exaggeration of his  praises.    The name of Giovanni ought not to go down unaccompanied by that of his  brother Gentile, who preceded him, alike in the period of his birth and  of his death. Though living apart, in regard to family, they were of  congenial mind and disposition, esteeming one another as friends and  brethren, mutually encouraging and respecting each other, as superior in  merit. But in Giovanni this was modesty, in Gentile only truth. For the  latter had a more confined genius; but by diligence, that sometimes  compensates the neglect of nature, he was enabled to attain an  honourable station among his contemporaries. He was employed by the  republic upon an equal footing with his brother, to adorn the hall of  the great council; and when the Grand Turk sent to Venice in search of  an eminent portrait painter, he was commissioned by the senate to go to  Constantinople, where in the exercise of his profession he added glory  to the Venetian name. Besides his works in painting, he there struck a  fine medallion for Mahomet II., bearing the head of the emperor, with  three crowns on the reverse; a rare work, of which, however, I learn  there is a specimen in possession of his Excellency, Theodore Corer.  However inferior we are to consider him to his brother, and tenacious of  that ancient harshness in many of his works, there are still several of  a more beautiful description, such as his histories of the Holy Cross at  San Giovanni, and the Preaching of S. Mark, at the college of that  saint; a piece, which, placed near that of a Paris Bordone, does no  discredit to its author. He shews himself a faithful copyist, inasmuch  as every thing he remarked in a concourse of people, is faithfully  pourtrayed. The features of the audience, and the peculiar conformations  of the body are as diversified as we see them in nature, including even  instances of deformity, into which through her own general laws, nature  is known to fall; and we are thus presented with caricatures, with bald,  and lean, and pursy, and, what is more remarkable, the auditors of S.  Mark are drawn without regard to times, in the costume of Venetians or  of Turks. Yet from its exact imitation of the truth, its arrangement,  and its animated style, the work does not fail to please and strike the  beholder. I shall even go further; for there are pictures on a smaller  scale, by the same hand, executed with so much taste, that they may be  esteemed not unworthy of the name of his brother. Such is a Presentation  of the infant Jesus at the Temple, in half length, which adorns the  Palazzo Barbarigo, at San Polo, a duplicate of which was painted for  that of the Grimani, with still more delicacy and care. Opposite to this  of Gentile is a fine picture of Gian Bellini, which, however, superior  in the softness of its tints, is considered scarcely equal in point of  beauty and other qualities of the art.    The two Bellini and the last of the Vivarini had a competitor in Vittore  Carpaccio, either a Venetian or a native of Capo d'Istria,[30] and along  with these he was selected to ornament the ducal palace. It was  destroyed by fire in 1576, when that noble collection of ancient  historic pieces perished, though subsequently restored by the most  celebrated artists of later times. Yet there still remains a specimen of  Vittore's style in the Oratory of Santa Ursula, sufficient to entitle  him to rank among the best artists of the age. It consists of eight  histories drawn from the acts of that saint, and of her eleven thousand  companions, which were all about that time very generally admitted to be  true. The production is not wanting in power of conception, developing  numerous and novel combinations, nor in the order of their distribution;  in richness of ideas, both in varying the features and costume, nor in  architectural skill and landscape, serving to adorn them. Still more  remarkable is its expression of nature and simplicity; an expression  which so frequently invited Zanetti himself to a renewed contemplation  of it. He there remarked the various passions of the people, who  appeared to understand every thing passing; and, in their earnest  attention, expressed sentiments in unison with the representation;  whence he concludes his description by saying that Carpaccio felt the  truth in his very heart.    He produced still nobler specimens of his genius in the college of San  Girolamo, which rivalled those of Giovanni Bellini, without, in this  instance, yielding to them. His character, which might frequently be  confounded with that of Gentile, shines most conspicuous, perhaps, in  his altarpieces, where he is original in almost every composition. The  most celebrated in Venice is one of the Purification at San Giobbe, in  which, however, the S. Vecchio Simeone is represented in a pontifical  dress, between two servants arrayed like cardinals. If we except this  error, in point of costume, and add a little more warmth of colours to  the flesh, more delicacy of contour, the piece would not discredit the  first artist of any times. Owing to the fault of his early education,  however, these qualities he never attained. This, also, happened to  Lazzaro Sebastiani, his disciple and follower; to Giovanni Mansueti, to  Marco, and to Pietro Veglia, as well as to Francesco Rizzo, of San  Croce, a territory in the district of Bergamo;[31] artists who, however  nearly they touched upon the golden period, did not succeed in freeing  themselves from the influence of the old and uniform taste, and for this  reason are often confounded with each other. I do not here treat of the  paintings left by them at Venice, as they have so frequently been  described elsewhere. It will be enough to inform the reader that in  these, also, we discover several noble traces of the style of Gentile  and Carpaccio, more especially in the architecture, and that their  colouring, which, in this school, is considered cold and languid, would  be termed, in several of the others, both soft and animated enough for  that period. The one who, if I mistake not, approaches nearer to the  modern, and in some degree towards the style of Giorgione, is Benedetto  Diana, as well in his altarpiece of Santa Lucia, at the SS. Apostoli, as  in the Limosina de' Confratelli di San Giovanni, painted at their  college in competition with the Bellini.    We next come to Marco Basaiti, sprung from a Greek family in the Friuli,  and a rival also of Giovanni; but more successful than Carpaccio. The  church of San Giobbe, here mentioned for the third time, possesses his  picture of Christ praying in the Garden, painted in 1510. It is now a  little defaced, but has been highly extolled by Ridolfi and others, who  beheld it in a more perfect condition. Above all his productions,  however, the Vocation of San Pietro to the Apostleship, in the church of  the Certosa, is the most celebrated; a piece, of which there is seen a  duplicate in the imperial gallery at Vienna. It is certainly one of the  most beautiful pictures of that age; and most generally there is no kind  of merit in Gian Bellini, in which Basaiti does not either equal, or  very closely approach him. Indeed he appears to exhibit even a freer  genius, a more happy composition, and a more skilful art in uniting the  grounds of his pictures with the figures. These are beautiful, and for  the most part incline to the free style; their look is full of fire; the  tints of the fleshy parts of a rosy glow; the middle tints inclining  sometimes to paleness, but not without grace. Though not a native, he  resided a long period at Venice, which contains a good number of his  works, a few of which are in the ancient taste, but the most part  bordering upon the modern. His native place of Friuli possesses no other  specimen besides a Christ taken from the Cross, in the monastery of  Sesto, consisting of large figures, with a fine group in the background  of the picture, and with a landscape full of nature. In several parts it  is defaced by age; but a true connoisseur will still, perhaps, prefer it  to the others, for being free from the retouches of modern art.    Among the pupils of Gian Bellini, who were very numerous, are some who  ought to be referred to another epoch, like Giorgione, and to different  schools, like Rondinello of Ravenna; several, however, take their place  here, who, in the opinion of their national contemporaries, did not  fully attain to the possession of the new style. The family of the heads  of the school, produced also a Bellin Bellini, who being educated in  that academy, very happily imitated its manner. He painted Madonnas for  private individuals, which, their author being little known, are for the  most part attributed to Gentile, or to Giovanni. The artist who is  mentioned by Vasari as the pupil of Giovanni, named Girolamo Mocetto,  was one of the earliest and least"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3470"],[0,"Such Is Life (#8)"],[1,"one time, on some business  about shares; an' when I come home, Molly was gone.  She'd left a letter  for me, sayin' she'd nothing to live for; an' we'd meet on the other side  o' the grave; an' I must always think kind of her; an' to remember ole times,  when there was on'y the two of us; an' prayin' God to bless me  for always bein' good to her--Why it knocked me stiff, for I'd always been  a selfish, unfeelin'\"----He stopped abruptly; he had uttered the last sentences  only by a strong effort.    Presently Dixon, pitying his emotion, remarked to Thompson in a gratuitously  lively tone, and with diction too florid for exact reproduction,    \"Say--was I tellin' you I seen that white bullock you swapped  to Cartwright las' year?  I think he's gittin' a cancer;  mebbe it's on'y blight; I would n't say.  An' that lyin' (individual),  Ike Cunningham, told me he busted his self with trefile  jist after Cartwright got him.\"    \"Ah!\" replied Thompson absently.    \"What become o' yer place?\" asked Mosey, turning to Cooper.    \"I'll answer that question, but not to satisfy you,\" replied Cooper coldly.  \"Well, chaps, when pore Molly's day was fixed, I scraped up a hundred notes,  an' borrered two hundred on the place, to give her a start when the thing  took place.  My ole dad he left everything to me, with strict orders  to see Molly through.  He did n't want to make her a bait for loafers.  Well, when the thing was squashed--me, like a fool, I was advised to lay  the money out in minin' shares for Molly; an' then I kep' risin' more money,  an' buyin' more shares; an' I got sort o' muddled somehow;  an' to make a long story short, the whole (adj.) thing went to (sheol).  It was goin' that road when I seen the last o' pore Molly; an' when I lost her,  I jist roused round an' got a team together, an' signed everything the lyin',  cheatin' (financiers) told me to sign; an' then I cleared off.  Must be gittin' on for--let's see--Molly was twenty-three when she  got her accident, an' it was three year after when she made away with herself.  That was nine year ago, so she'd be thirty-five if she was alive now.  She need n't 'a' done it! O, she should n't 'a' done it!--  for she'd the satisfaction o' knowin' the curse that come on that blasted dog!  I told her all the particulars I got, thinkin' to satisfy her;  but I believe it on'y done her harm, for the end come a week or ten days after.  Seems strange, lookin' back at it, to think how simple our fam'ly's been  broke up, an' my gran'father's old home gone into the hands o' strangers.\"    \"Never got a trace of your sister?\" asked Thompson.    \"Not a trace.  Some people would have it she was gone to America,  or California, or somewhere--but why would she go?  Me an' the Ryans--  that was the married couple we had--we knowed most about it, an' we cared most;  an' we was sure from the first, though we done everything that could be done.  She went away at night, an' took nothing with her--not a single item  o' clothes, but jist as she stood.  Ah! I'd give what little I got,  an' walk a thousand mile on to the back of it, to see her pore bones  buried safe, an' then I'd be satisfied.\"    Cooper sighed deeply, and lit his pipe; then, for a time, the utter stillness  of the bright starlight was broken only by the faint jingle  of the horses' hobble-chains, and the sound of some of the nearer bullocks  cropping the luxuriant grass.    \"The ram-paddick's a fool to this spot,\" remarked Mosey, at length.  \"Mind you, it was friendly of Number Two to lay us on.  On'y decent thing  I ever knowed him to do.  He ain't the clean spud.\"    \"He's ill-natured, certainly,\" observed Thompson; \"but I can't help taking  an interest in him.  As a general rule, the more uncivilised a man is,  till you come right down to the level of the blackfellow,  the better bushman he is; but I must say this of Thingamybob,  that he comes as near the blackfellow\"----    \"Hold on,\" interrupted Dixon, whose private conversation with Bum  had caused him to lose step in the march of conversation--\"Who the (sheol)  is this Thingamybob--bar sells?\"    \"I wish somebody would fetch me a drink of water,\" replied Thompson,  dropping his subject in pointed rebuke of Dixon's behaviour.  \"I'd rather perish than go for it myself; and I won't live two hours  if I don't get it.  It's Cooper's fault.  When he keeps the meat fresh,  it walks away; and when he packs it in salt, and then roasts it in the pan--  like this evening--you can see the salt all over it like frost.  Grand remedy for scurvy, and Barcoo rot, and the hundreds of natural diseases  that flesh is subject to, as the poet says.\"    \"Lis'n that (adj.) liar,\" growled Cooper, with a fairly successful attempt  at easy good-nature.  \"An' I'm as bad off as him; an' there ain't a whimper  out o' me.\"    \"I'll bring a drink for you both,\" said I, rising and taking two pannikins  from the lid of the tucker-box.  \"I would n't do it only that I'm famishing,  myself; and I'm tired of waiting for some one else to give in.\"    Then, whilst helping myself to a drink from the water-bag under the rear  of Thompson's wagon, and filling the pannikins for my friends,  I couldn't possibly avoid overhearing the conversation which sprang into life  the moment my back was turned----    \"My lord Billy-be-damd,\" remarked Mosey.  \"Wonder why the (sheol)  he ain't at Runnymede to-night, doin' the amiable with Mother Bodysark.  Bright pair, them two.\"    \"Would n't trust him as fur's I could sling him,\" said Dixon.  \"Too thick with the (adj.) squatters for my fancy.  A man never knows what game  that bloke's up to.\"    \"Can't make him out no road,\" confessed Cooper.  \"Seems a decent, easy-goin',  God-send-Sunday sort o' feller; but I'll swear there's more in his head  nor a comb'll take out.\"    \"He calls himself a philosopher,\" murmured Thompson; \"but his philosophy  mostly consists in thinking he knows everything, and other people know nothing.  That's the principal point I've seen in him; and we've been acquainted  since we were about that high.  It was always his way.\"    \"Who's this Mother Bodysark--if it's a fair question?\" asked Cooper.    \"Mrs. Beaudesart,\" corrected Thompson.  \"She's a widow woman--  sort of forty-second cousin to Mrs. Montgomery, and housekeeper at the station.  I never heard of anybody grudging her to Collins.\"    \"Between ourselves, Thompson,\" remarked Willoughby, \"his conversation  this afternoon rather amused me.  It recalled to my mind an excellent  and most characteristic pleasantry, which you may not have heard.  The story goes that Coleridge once asked Lamb, 'Did you ever hear me preach?'  'Preach!' said Lamb; 'Gad, I never heard you do anything else!' And yet,  if Mr. Collins had enjoyed the advantages accruing from even the rudiments  of a liberal ed\"----    \"He's got summick to do with Gub'ment lately,\" said Price cunningly.  \"My 'pinion, he's shadderin' summedy.\"    \"He ain't a gurl o' that sort,\" interposed Bum hastily.  \"My 'pinion,  he's a spieler.  No more a detective nor I am.\"    I returned to the group.  My friends drained their pannikins;  Thompson threw his at the tucker-box, and Cooper was just aiming his,  when Willoughby, who had shared the frosted mutton, interposed----    \"If you please, Cooper.\"    \"Seen better days, pore (fellow),\" observed Cooper sympathetically,  as the ripple of the water into the pannikin indicated that the whaler  was at the tap.    \"Can't see much worse,\" mused Thompson.    \"My (adj.) oath--can't he?\" chuckled Mosey.  \"Hold on till he gits old.\"    \"People seem to think Gawd made these here colonies for a rubbage-heap,\"  said Bum.  \"That's the English idear of\"----    \"Stiddy, Charley,\" interrupted Dixon.  \"Everybody's got a right to live,  an' that pore (fellow)'s got jist as much right as me or you.  A man ought to show respect to misforcune, Charley.\"    \"Shall I bring a pannikin of water for any of you gentlemen?\"  asked Willoughby, without a trace of ironical emphasis on the last word.    \"Fetch me one while yer hand's in,\" replied Bum    Willoughby brought the drink.  I fancied even an accession  to the subdued suavity of his manner as he picked up and replaced  on the tuckerbox the empty pannikin which Bum had thanklessly tossed  on the ground at his feet.  Then he resumed his place; and Thompson,  palpably turning his back on Dixon and Bum, selected him as chief hearer  of his recommenced discourse----    \"Comes as near the blackfellow as it's possible for a white man to get.  And you couldn't kill him with an axe.  Then start him at any civilised work--  such as splicing a loop on a wool rope, or making a yoke,  or wedging a loose box in a wheel--and he has the best hands in the country.  At the same time, it's plain to be seen that he has been brought up  in the class of society that sticks a napkin, in a bone ring,  alongside your plate at dinner.\" Here Thompson paused, and the recurrence  of some distressing memory elicited a half-suppressed sigh.    \"There is nothing unreasonable in that phenomenon,\" remarked Willoughby--  \"rather the reverse.  Probably the person you speak of is a gentleman.  Now, the man who is a gentleman by birth and culture--by which I mean a man  of good family, who has not only gone through the curriculum of a university,  but has graduated, so to speak, in society--such a one has every advantage  in any conceivable situation.  The records of military enterprise, exploration,  pioneering, and so forth, furnish abundant evidence of this very obvious fact.  You will find, I think, that high breeding and training are conditions of  superiority in the human as well as in the equine and canine races; pedigree  being, of course, the primary desideratum. Non generant aquilae columbas,  we say.\"    \"Don't run away with the idear that nobody knows who Columbus was,\"  retorted Bum.  \"He discovered America--or else my readin's did me  (adj.) little good.\"    \"More power to yer (adj."]]]
