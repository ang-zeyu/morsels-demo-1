And the third was  sentenced to receive fifty lashes, but was recommended by the court to  the Governor, and forgiven.    Hitherto, however, (February) nothing of a very atrocious nature had  appeared. But the day was at hand, on which the violation of public  security could no longer be restrained, by the infliction of temporary  punishment. A set of desperate and hardened villains leagued themselves  for the purposes of depredation, and, as it generally happens, had art  enough to persuade some others, less deeply versed in iniquity, to be  the instruments for carrying it on. Fortunately the progress of these  miscreants was not of long duration. They were detected in stealing a  large quantity of provisions at the time of issuing them. And on being  apprehended, one of the tools of the superiors impeached the rest, and  disclosed the scheme. The trial came on the 28th of the month, and of  four who were arraigned for the offence, three were condemned to die,  and the fourth to receive a very severe corporal punishment. In hopes  that his lenity would not be abused, his Excellency was, however,  pleased to order one only for execution, which took place a little  before sun-set the same day. The name of the unhappy wretch was Thomas  Barret, an old and desperate offender, who died with that hardy spirit,  which too often is found in the worst and most abandoned class of men.  During the execution the battalion of marines was under arms, and the  whole of the convicts obliged to be present. The two associates of the  sufferer were ordered to be kept close prisoners, until an eligible  place to banish them to could be fixed on; as were also two more, who on  the following day were condemned to die for a similar offence.    Besides the Criminal court, there is an inferior one composed of the  Judge Advocate, and one or more justices of the peace, for the trial of  small misdemeanours. This court is likewise empowered to decide all law  suits, and its verdict is final, except where the sum in dispute amounts  to more than three hundred pounds, in which case an appeal to England  can be made from its decree. Should necessity warrant it, an Admiralty  court, of which Lieutenant Governor Ross is judge, can also be summoned,  for the trial of offences committed on the high seas.    From being unwilling to break the thread of my narrative, I omitted to  note in its proper place the sailing of the 'Supply', Lieut. Ball,  on the 15th of the month, for Norfolk Island, which the Governor had  instructions from the ministry to take possession of. Lieut. King of  the Sirius was sent as superintendent and commandant of this place,  and carried with him a surgeon, a midshipman, a sawyer, a weaver, two  marines, and sixteen convicts, of whom six were women. He was also  supplied with a certain number of live animals to stock the island,  besides garden seeds, grain, and other requisites.          CHAPTER XI      A Description of the Natives of New South Wales, and our Transactions  with them.      I doubt not my readers will be as glad as I feel myself, to conclude the  dull detail of the last chapter. If they please, they may turn from the  subtle intricacies of the law, to contemplate the simple, undisguised  workings of nature, in her most artless colouring.    I have already said, we had been but very few days at Port Jackson, when  an alteration in the behaviour of the natives was perceptible; and I  wish I could add, that a longer residence in their neighbourhood had  introduced a greater degree of cordiality and intermixture between  the old, and new, lords of the soil, than at the day on which this  publication is dated subsists.    From their easy reception of us in the beginning, many were induced to  call in question the accounts which Mr. Cook had given of this people.  That celebrated navigator, we were willing believe, had somehow by  his conduct offended them, which prevented the intercourse that would  otherwise have taken place. The result, however, of our repeated  endeavours to induce them to come among us has been such as to confirm  me in an opinion, that they either fear or despise us too much, to be  anxious for a closer connection. And I beg leave at once, to apprize the  reader, that all I can here, or in any future part of this work, relate  with fidelity of the natives of New South Wales, must be made up of  detached observations, taken at different times, and not from a regular  series of knowledge of the customs and manners of a people, with whom  opportunities of communication are so scarce, as to have been seldom  obtained.    In their persons, they are far from being a stout race of men, though  nimble, sprightly, and vigorous. The deficiency of one of the fore teeth  of the upper jaw, mentioned by Dampier, we have seen in almost the whole  of the men; but their organs of sight so far from being defective, as  that author mentions those of the inhabitants of the western side of the  continent to be, are remarkably quick and piercing. Their colour, Mr.  Cook is inclined to think rather a deep chocolate, than an absolute  black, though he confesses, they have the appearance of the latter,  which he attributes to the greasy filth their skins are loaded with.  Of their want of cleanliness we have had sufficient proofs, but I am of  opinion, all the washing in the world would not render them two degrees  less black than an African negro. At some of our first interviews, we  had several droll instances of their mistaking the Africans we brought  with us for their own countrymen.    Notwithstanding the disregard they have invariably shewn for all the  finery we could deck them with, they are fond of adorning themselves  with scars, which increase their natural hideousness. It is hardly  possible to see any thing in human shape more ugly, than one of these  savages thus scarified, and farther ornamented with a fish bone struck  through the gristle of the nose. The custom of daubing themselves  with white earth is also frequent among both sexes: but, unlike the  inhabitants of the Islands in the Pacific Ocean, they reject the  beautiful feathers which the birds of their country afford.    Exclusive of their weapons of offence, and a few stone hatchets very  rudely fashioned, their ingenuity is confined to manufacturing small  nets, in which they put the fish they catch, and to fish-hooks made of  bone, neither of which are unskilfully executed. On many of the rocks  are also to be found delineations of the figures of men and birds, very  poorly cut.    Of the use or benefit of cloathing, these people appear to have no  comprehension, though their sufferings from the climate they live in,  strongly point out the necessity of a covering from the rigour of the  seasons. Both sexes, and those of all ages, are invariably found naked.  But it must not be inferred from this, that custom so inures them to  the changes of the elements, as to make them bear with indifference the  extremes of heat and cold; for we have had visible and repeated proofs,  that the latter affects them severely, when they are seen shivering,  and huddling themselves up in heaps in their huts, or the caverns of the  rocks, until a fire can be kindled.    Than these huts nothing more rude in construction, or deficient in  conveniency, can be imagined. They consist only of pieces of bark laid  together in the form of an oven, open at one end, and very low, though  long enough for a man to lie at full length. There is reason, however,  to believe, that they depend less on them for shelter, than on the  caverns with which the rocks abound.    To cultivation of the ground they are utter strangers, and wholly depend  for food on the few fruits they gather; the roots they dig up in the  swamps; and the fish they pick up along shore, or contrive to strike  from their canoes with spears. Fishing, indeed, seems to engross nearly  the whole of their time, probably from its forming the chief part of a  subsistence, which, observation has convinced us, nothing short of the  most painful labour, and unwearied assiduity, can procure. When fish  are scarce, which frequently happens, they often watch the moment of  our hauling the seine, and have more than once been known to plunder its  contents, in spite of the opposition of those on the spot to guard it:  and this even after having received a part of what had been caught. The  only resource at these times is to shew a musquet, and if the bare sight  is not sufficient, to fire it over their heads, which has seldom failed  of dispersing them hitherto, but how long the terror which it excites  may continue is doubtful.    The canoes in which they fish are as despicable as their huts, being  nothing more than a large piece of bark tied up at both ends with vines.  Their dexterous management of them, added to the swiftness with which  they paddle, and the boldness that leads them several miles in the  open sea, are, nevertheless, highly deserving of admiration. A canoe  is seldom seen without a fire in it, to dress the fish by, as soon as  caught: fire they procure by attrition.    From their manner of disposing of those who die, which will be mentioned  hereafter, as well as from every other observation, there seems no  reason to suppose these people cannibals; nor do they ever eat animal  substances in a raw state, unless pressed by extreme hunger, but  indiscriminately broil them, and their vegetables, on a fire, which  renders these last an innocent food, though in their raw state many of  them are of a poisonous quality: as a poor convict who unguardedly  eat of them experienced, by falling a sacrifice in twenty-four hours  afterwards. If bread be given to the Indians, they chew and spit it  out again, seldom choosing to swallow it. Salt beef and pork they like  rather better, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3536"],[0,"The Enchanted Castle (#8)"],[1,"from among the splashes    \"I don't know,\" said Kathleen, \"but I'm sure we ought to tell the  truth.\"    \"You can, if you like,\" said a voice from the folds of a towel that  waved lonely in front of the wash-hand stand    \"All right. We will, then, first thing after brek your brek, I mean.  You'll have to wait up here till we can collar something and bring  it up to you. Mind you dodge Eliza when she comes to make the  bed.\"    The invisible Mabel found this a fairly amusing game; she further  enlivened it by twitching out the corners of tucked-up sheets and  blankets when Eliza wasn't looking.    \"Drat the clothes!\" said Eliza; \"anyone ud think the things was  bewitched.\"    She looked about for the wonderful Princess clothes she had  glimpsed earlier in the morning. But Kathleen had hidden them in  a perfectly safe place under the mattress, which she knew Eliza  never turned.    Eliza hastily brushed up from the floor those bits of fluff which  come from goodness knows where in the best regulated houses.  Mabel, very hungry and exasperated at the long absence of the  others at their breakfast, could not forbear to whisper suddenly in  Eliza's ear:    \"Always sweep under the mats.\"    The maid started and turned pale. \"I must be going silly,\" she  murmured; \"though it's just what mother always used to say. Hope  I ain't going dotty, like Aunt Emily. Wonderful what you can  fancy, ain't it?\"    She took up the hearth-rug all the same, swept under it, and under  the fender. So thorough was she, and so pale, that Kathleen,  entering with a chunk of bread raided by Gerald from the pantry  window, exclaimed:    \"Not done yet. I say, Eliza, you do look ill! What's the matter?\"    \"I thought I'd give the room a good turn-out,\" said Eliza, still very  pale.    \"Nothing's happened to upset you?\" Kathleen asked. She had her  own private fears.    \"Nothing only my fancy, miss,\" said Eliza. \"I always was fanciful  from a child dreaming of the pearly gates and them little angels  with nothing on only their heads and wings so cheap to dress, I  always think, compared with children.\"    When she was got rid of, Mabel ate the bread and drank water  from the tooth-mug.    \"I'm afraid it tastes of cherry tooth-paste rather,\" said Kathleen  apologetically.    \"It doesn't matter,\" a voice replied from the tilted mug; \"it's more  interesting than water. I should think red wine in ballads was  rather like this.\"    \"We've got leave for the day again,\" said Kathleen, when the last  bit of bread had vanished, \"and Gerald feels like I do about lies, So  we're going to tell your aunt where you really are.\"    \"She won't believe you.\"    \"That doesn't matter, if we speak the truth,\" said Kathleen primly.    \"I expect you'll be sorry for it,\" said Mabel; \"but come on and, I  say, do be careful not to shut me in the door as you go out. You  nearly did just now.\"    In the blazing sunlight that flooded the High Street four shadows  to three children seemed dangerously noticeable. A butcher's boy  looked far too earnestly at the extra shadow, and his big,  liver-coloured lurcher snuffed at the legs of that shadow's mistress  and whined uncomfortably.    \"Get behind me,\" said Kathleen; \"then our two shadows will look  like one.\"    But Mabel's shadow, very visible, fell on Kathleen's back, and the  ostler of the Davenant Arms looked up to see what big bird had  cast that big shadow.    A woman driving a cart with chickens and ducks in it called out:  \"Halloa, missy, ain't you blacked yer back, neither! What you been  leaning up against?\"    Everyone was glad when they got out of the town.    Speaking the truth to Mabel's aunt did not turn out at all as anyone  even Mabel expected. The aunt was discovered reading a pink  novelette at the window of the housekeeper's room, which, framed  in clematis and green creepers, looked out on a nice little  courtyard to which Mabel led the party.    \"Excuse me,\" said Gerald, \"but I believe you've lost your niece?\"    \"Not lost, my boy,\" said the aunt, who was spare and tall, with a  drab fringe and a very genteel voice.    \"We could tell you something about her,\" said Gerald.    \"Now,\" replied the aunt, in a warning voice, \"no complaints,  please. My niece has gone, and I am sure no one thinks less than I  do of her little pranks. If she's played any tricks on you it's only her  lighthearted way. Go away, children, I'm busy.\"    \"Did you get her note?\" asked Kathleen.    The aunt showed rather more interest than before, but she still kept  her finger in the novelette.    \"Oh,\" she said, \"so you witnessed her departure? Did she seem  glad to go?\"    \"Quite,\" said Gerald truthfully.    \"Then I can only be glad that she is provided for,\" said the aunt. \"I  dare say you were surprised. These romantic adventures do occur  in our family. Lord Yalding selected me out of eleven applicants  for the post of housekeeper here. I've not the slightest doubt the  child was changed at birth and her rich relatives have claimed  her.\"    \"But aren't you going to do anything tell the police, or\"    \"Shish!\" said Mabel.    \"I won't shish,\" said Jimmy. \"Your Mabel's invisible  that's all it is.  She's just beside me now.\"    \"I detest untruthfulness,\" said the aunt severely, \"in all its forms.  Will you kindly take that little boy away? I am quite satisfied  about Mabel.\"    \"Well,\" said Gerald, \"you are an aunt and no mistake! But what  will Mabel's father and mother say?\"    \"Mabel's father and mother are dead,\" said the aunt calmly, and a  little sob sounded close to Gerald's ear.    \"All right,\" he said, \"we'll be off. But don't you go saying we didn't  tell you the truth, that's all.\"    \"You have told me nothing,\" said the aunt, \"none of you, except  that little boy, who has told me a silly falsehood.\"    \"We meant well,\" said Gerald gently. \"You don't mind our having  come through the grounds, do you? we're very careful not to touch  anything.\"    \"No visitors are allowed,\" said the aunt, glancing down at her  novel rather impatiently.    \"Ah! but you wouldn't count us visitors,\" said Gerald in his best  manner. \"We re friends of Mabel's. Our father's Colonel of the th.\"    \"Indeed!\" said the aunt.    \"And our aunt's Lady Sandling, so you can be sure we wouldn't  hurt anything on the estate.\"    \"I'm sure you wouldn't hurt a fly,\" said the aunt absently.  \"Good-bye. Be good children.\"    And on this they got away quickly.    \"Why,\" said Gerald, when they were outside the little court, \"your  aunt's as mad as a hatter. Fancy not caring what becomes of you,  and fancy believing that rot about the motor lady!\"    \"I knew she'd believe it when I wrote it,\" said Mabel modestly.  \"She's not mad, only she's always reading novelettes, I read the  books in the big library. Oh, it's such a jolly room such a queer  smell, like boots, and old leather books sort of powdery at the  edges. I'll take you there some day. Now your consciences are all  right about my aunt, I'll tell you my great idea. Let's get down to  the Temple of Flora. I'm glad you got aunt's permission for the  grounds. It would be so awkward for you to have to be always  dodging behind bushes when one of the gardeners came along.\"    \"Yes,\" said Gerald modestly, \"I thought of that.\"    The day was as bright as yesterday had been, and from the white  marble temple the Italian-looking landscape looked more than ever  like a steel engraving coloured by hand, or an oleographic  imitation of one of Turner's pictures.    When the three children were comfortably settled on the steps that  led up to the white statue, the voice of the fourth child said sadly:  \"I'm not ungrateful, hut I'm rather hungry. And you can't be always  taking things for me through your larder window. If you like, I'll go  back and live in the castle. It's supposed to be haunted. I suppose I  could haunt it as well as anyone else. I am a sort of ghost now, you  know. I will if you like.\"    \"Oh no,\" said Kathleen kindly; \"you must stay with us.    \"But about food. I'm not ungrateful, really I'm not, but breakfast is  breakfast, and bread's only bread.\"    \"If you could get the ring off, you could go back.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mabel's voice, \"but you see, I can't. I tried again last  night in bed, and again this morning. And it's like stealing, taking  things out of your larder even if it's only bread.\"    \"Yes, it is,\" said Gerald, who had carried out this bold enterprise.    \"Well, now, what we must do is to earn some money.\"    Jimmy remarked that this was all very well. But Gerald and  Kathleen listened attentively.    \"What I mean to say,\" the voice went on, \"I'm really sure is all for  the best, me being invisible. We shall have adventures you see if  we don t.\"    \"Adventures,\" said the bold buccaneer, \"are not always profitable.\"  It was Gerald who murmured this.    \"This one will be, anyhow, you see. Only you mustn't all go. Look  here, if Jerry could make himself look common \"    \"That ought to be easy,\" said Jimmy. And Kathleen told him not to  be so jolly disagreeable.    \"I'm not,\" said Jimmy, \"only \"    \"Only he has an inside feeling that this Mabel of yours is going to  get us into trouble,\" put in Gerald. \"Like La Belle Dame Sans  Merci, and he does not want to be found in future ages alone and  palely loitering in the middle of sedge and things.\"    \"I won't get you into trouble, indeed I won t,\" said the voice. \"Why,  we're a band of brothers for life, after the way you stood by me  yesterday. What I mean is Gerald can go to the fair and do  conjuring.\"    \"He doesn't know any,\" said Kathleen.    \"I should do it really,\" said Mabel, \"but Jerry could look like doing  it move things without touching them and all that. But it wouldn't  do for all three of you to go. The more there are of children the  younger they look, I think, and the more people wonder what they  re doing all alone by themselves.\"    \"The accomplished conjurer deemed these the words of wisdom,\"  said Gerald; and"]]]
