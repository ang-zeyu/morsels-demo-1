But he gave a happy little laugh, and  said to the prince, gratefully:    \"Thank you very much, my master!  The fall is hurting me delightfully.  I almost feel as if I could cry, and that would be joy indeed!\"    \"Well,\" answered the prince, with a sigh, \"I see I must get my hands  greased after all\"--for the black's body had really been greased to  enable him to elude the grasp of his opponents.    But Marvel made a quick leap and seized the Wrestler firmly around the  waist.  The next moment, to the astonishment of all, the black man flew  swiftly into the air, plunged through one of the open windows high up  in the wall, and disappeared from view.  When the king and his people  again turned their wondering eyes upon the prince he was wiping his  hands carefully upon a silk handkerchief.    At this sight a pretty young girl, who stood near the throne, laughed  aloud, and the sound of her laughter made King Terribus very angry.    \"Come here!\" he commanded, sternly.  The girl stepped forward, her face  now pale and frightened, while tear-drops trembled upon the lashes that  fringed her downcast eyes.  \"You have dared to laugh at the humiliation  of your king,\" said Terribus, his horrid face more crimson than ever,  \"and as atonement I command that you drink of the poisoned cup.\"    Instantly a dwarf came near, bearing a beautiful golden goblet in his  crooked hands.    \"Drink!\" he said, an evil leer upon his face.    The girl well knew this goblet contained a vile poison, one drop of  which on her tongue would cause death; so she hesitated, trembling and  shrinking from the ordeal.    Prince Marvel looked into her sweet face with pitying eyes, and  stepping quickly to her side, took her hand in his.    \"Now drink!\" he said, smiling upon her; \"the poison will not hurt you.\"    She drank obediently, while the dwarf chuckled with awful glee and the  king looked on eagerly, expecting her to fall dead at his feet.  But  instead the girl stood upright and pressed Marvel's hand, looking  gratefully into his face.    \"You are a fairy!\" she whispered, so low that no one else heard her  voice.  \"I knew that you would save me.\"    \"Keep my secret,\" whispered the prince in return, and still holding her  hand he led her back to her former place.    King Terribus was almost wild with rage and disappointment, and his  elephant nose twisted and squirmed horribly.    \"So you dare to thwart my commands, do you!\" he cried, excitedly.  \"Well, we shall soon see which of us is the more powerful.  I have  decreed your death--and die you shall!\"    For a moment his eye roved around the chamber uncertainly.  Then he  shouted, suddenly:    \"Ho, there!  Keepers of the royal menagerie--appear!\"    Three men entered the room and bowed before the king.  They were of the  Gray Men of the mountains, who had followed Prince Marvel and Nerle  through the rocky passes.    \"Bring hither the Royal Dragon,\" cried the king, \"and let him consume  these strangers before my very eyes!\"    The men withdrew, and presently was heard a distant shouting, followed  by a low rumbling sound, with groans, snorts, roars and a hissing like  steam from the spout of a teakettle.    The noise and shouting drew nearer, while the people huddled together  like frightened sheep; and then suddenly the doors flew open and the  Royal Dragon advanced to the center of the room.    This creature was at once the pride and terror of the Kingdom of Spor.  It was more than thirty feet in length and covered everywhere with  large green scales set with diamonds, making the dragon, when it moved,  a very glittering spectacle.  Its eyes were as big as pie-plates, and  its mouth--when wide opened--fully as large as a bath-tub.  Its tail  was very long and ended in a golden ball, such as you see on the top of  flagstaffs.  Its legs, which were as thick as those of an elephant, had  scales which were set with rubies and emeralds.  It had two monstrous,  big ears and two horns of carved ivory, and its teeth were also carved  into various fantastic shapes--such as castles, horses' heads, chinamen  and griffins--so that if any of them broke it would make an excellent  umbrella handle.    The Royal Dragon of Spor came crawling into the throne-room rather  clumsily, groaning and moaning with every step and waving its ears like  two blankets flying from a clothesline.    The king looked on it and frowned.    \"Why are you not breathing fire and brimstone?\" he demanded, angrily.    \"Why, I was caught out in a gale the other night,\" returned the Dragon,  rubbing the back of its ear with its left front paw, as it paused and  looked at the king, \"and the wind put out my fire.\"    \"Then why didn't you light it again?\" asked Terribus, turning on the  keepers.    \"We--we were out of matches, your Majesty!\" stammered the trembling  Gray Men.    \"So--ho!\" yelled the king, and was about to order the keepers beheaded;  but just then Nerle pulled out his match-box, lit one of the matches,  and held it in front of the Dragon's mouth.  Instantly the creature's  breath caught fire; and it began to breathe flames a yard in length.    \"That's better,\" sighed the Dragon, contentedly.  \"I hope your Majesty  is now satisfied.\"    \"No,--I am not satisfied!\" declared King Terribus.  \"Why do you not  lash your tail?\"    \"Ah, I can't do that!\" replied the Dragon.  \"It's all stiffened up with  rheumatism from the dampness of my cave.  It hurts too much to lash it.\"    \"Well, then, gnash your teeth!\" commanded the king.    \"Tut--tut!\" answered the Dragon, mildly; \"I can't do that, either; for  since you had them so beautifully carved it makes my teeth ache to  gnash them.\"    \"Well, then, what are you good for?\" cried the king, in a fury.    \"Don't I look awful?  Am I not terrible to gaze on?\" inquired the  Dragon, proudly, as it breathed out red and yellow flames and made them  curl in circles around its horns.  \"I guess there's no need for me to  suggest terror to any one that happens to see me,\" it added, winking  one of the pie-plate eyes at King Terribus.    The king looked at the monster critically, and it really seemed to him  that it was a frightful thing to behold.  So he curbed his anger and  said, in his ordinary sweet voice:    \"I have called you here to destroy these two strangers.\"    \"How?\" asked the Dragon, looking upon Prince Marvel and Nerle with  interest.    \"I am not particular,\" answered the king.  \"You may consume them with  your fiery breath, or smash them with your tail, or grind them to atoms  between your teeth, or tear them to pieces with your claws.  Only, do  hurry up and get it over with!\"    \"Hm-m-m!\" said the Dragon, thoughtfully, as if it didn't relish the  job; \"this one isn't Saint George, is it?\"    \"No, no!\" exclaimed the king, irritably; \"it's Prince Marvel.  Do get  to work as soon as possible.\"    \"Prince Marvel--Prince Marvel,\" repeated the Dragon.  \"Why, there isn't  a prince in the whole world named Marvel!  I'm pretty well posted on  the history of royal families, you know.  I'm afraid he's Saint George  in disguise.\"    \"Isn't your name Prince Marvel?\" inquired the king, turning to the  boyish-looking stranger.    \"It is,\" answered Marvel.    \"Well, it's mighty strange I've never heard of you,\" persisted the  Dragon.  \"But tell me, please, how would you prefer to be killed?\"    \"Oh, I'm not going to be killed at all,\" replied the prince, laughing.    \"Do you hear that, Terribus?\" asked the Dragon, turning to the king;  \"he says he isn't going to be killed.\"    \"But I say he is!\" cried Terribus.  \"I have decreed his death.\"    \"But do you suppose I'm going to kill a man against his will?\" inquired  the Dragon, in a reproachful voice; \"and such a small man, too!  Do you  take me for a common assassin--or a murderer?\"    \"Do you intend to obey my orders?\" roared the king.    \"No, I don't; and that's flat!\" returned the Dragon, sharply.  \"It's  time for me to take my cough medicine; so if you've nothing more to say  I'll go back to my cave.\"    \"Go, go, go!\" shrieked the king, stamping his foot in passion.  \"You've  outlived your usefulness!  You're a coward!  You're a traitor!  You're  a--a--a--\"    \"I'm a dragon and a gentleman!\" answered the monster, proudly, as the  king paused for lack of a word; \"and I believe I know what's proper for  dragons to do and what isn't.  I've learned wisdom from my father, who  got into trouble with Saint George, and if I fought with this person  who calls himself Prince Marvel, I'd deserve to be a victim of your  Fool-Killer.  Oh, I know my business, King Terribus; and if you knew  yours, you'd get rid of this pretended prince as soon as possible!\"    With this speech he winked at Prince Marvel, turned soberly around and  crawled from the room.  One of the keepers got too near and the  Dragon's breath set fire to his robe, the flames being with difficulty  extinguished; and the gold ball on the end of the Dragon's tail struck  a giant upon his shins and made him dance and howl in pain.    But, aside from these slight accidents, the monster managed to leave  the throne-room without undue confusion, and every one, including the  king, seemed glad to be rid of him.        10.  Prince Marvel Wins His Fight    When the door had closed on the Royal Dragon, King Terribus turned  again to Prince Marvel, while his crimson face glowed with  embarrassment, and his front eye rolled with baffled rage as he thought  how vain had been all his efforts to kill this impudent invader of his  domains.    But his powers were by no means exhausted.  He was a mighty king--the  mightiest of all in the Enchanted Island, he believed--and ways to  destroy his enemies were numerous.    \"Send for a hundred of my Gray Men!\" he suddenly cried; and a courtier  ran at once to summon them.  The Gray Men would obey his orders without  question, he well knew.  They were silent, stubborn, quick, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5180"],[0,"Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Ruling (#8)"],[1,"otherwise inappropriate  behavior that occurred in their libraries before they began using  Internet filtering software compared to the amount that happened  after they installed the software.  The plaintiffs' witnesses  also testified that because public libraries are public places,  incidents involving inappropriate behavior in libraries (sexual  and otherwise) existed long before libraries provided access to  the Internet.  2.        Methods for Regulating Internet Use  The methods that public libraries use to regulate Internet  use vary greatly.  They can be organized into four categories:  (1) channeling patrons' Internet use; (2) separating patrons so  that they will not see what other patrons are viewing; (3)  placing Internet terminals in public view and having librarians  observe patrons to make sure that they are complying with the  library's Internet use policy; and (4) using Internet filtering  software.  The first category  channeling patrons' Internet use   frequently includes offering training to patrons on how to use  the Internet, including how to access the information that they  want and to avoid the materials that they do not want.  Another  technique that some public libraries use to direct their patrons  to pages that the libraries have determined to be accurate and  valuable is to establish links to \"recommended Web sites\" from  the public library's home page (i.e., the page that appears when  patrons begin a session at one of the library's public Internet  terminals).  Librarians select these recommended Web sites by  using criteria similar to those employed in traditional  collection development.  However, unless the library determines  otherwise, selection of these specific sites does not preclude  patrons from attempting to access other Internet Web sites.      Libraries may extend the \"recommended Web sites\" method  further by limiting patrons' access to only those Web sites that  are reviewed and selected by the library's staff.  For example,  in 1996, the Westerville, Ohio Library offered Internet access to  children through a service called the \"Library Channel.\"  This  service was intended to be a means by which the library could  organize the Internet in some fashion for presentation to  patrons.  Through the Library Channel, the computers in the  children's section of the library were restricted to 2,000 to  3,000 sites selected by librarians.  After three years,  Westerville stopped using the Library Channel system because it  overly constrained the children's ability to access materials on  the Internet, and because the library experienced several  technical problems with the system.      Public libraries also use several different techniques to  separate patrons during Internet sessions so that they will not  see what other patrons are viewing.  The simplest way to achieve  this result is to position the library's public Internet  terminals so that they are located away from traffic patterns in  the library (and from other terminals), for example, by placing  them so that they face a wall.  This method is obviously  constrained by libraries' space limitations and physical layout.   Some libraries have also installed privacy screens on their  public Internet terminals.  These screens make a monitor appear  blank unless the viewer is looking at it head-on.   Although the  Multnomah and Fort Vancouver Libraries submitted records showing  that they have received few complaints regarding patrons'  unwilling exposure to materials on the Internet, privacy screens  do not always prevent library patrons or employees from  inadvertently seeing the materials that another patron is viewing  when passing directly behind a terminal.  They also have the  drawback of making it difficult for patrons to work together at a  single terminal, or for librarians to assist patrons at  terminals, because it is difficult for two people to stand side  by side and view a screen at the same time.  Some library patrons  also find privacy screens to be a hindrance and have attempted to  remove them in order to improve the brightness of the screen or  to make the view better.      Another method that libraries use to prevent patrons from  seeing what other patrons are viewing on their terminals is the  installation of \"recessed monitors.\"  Recessed monitors are  computer screens that sit below the level of a desk top and are  viewed from above.  Although recessed monitors, especially when  combined with privacy screens, eliminate almost all of the  possibility of a patron accidentally viewing the contents on  another patron's screen, they suffer from the same drawbacks as  privacy screens, that is, they make it difficult for patrons to  work together or with a librarian at a single terminal.  Some  librarians also testified that recessed monitors are costly, but  did not indicate how expensive they are compared to privacy  screens or filtering software.  A related technique that some  public libraries use is to create a separate children's Internet  viewing area, where no adults except those accompanying children  in their care may use the Internet terminals.  This serves the  objective of keeping children from inadvertently viewing  materials appropriate only for adults that adults may be viewing  on nearby terminals.  A third set of techniques that public libraries have used to  enforce their Internet use policies takes the opposite tack from  the privacy screens/recessed monitors approach by placing all of  the library's public Internet terminals in prominent and visible  locations, such as near the library's reference desk.  This  approach allows librarians to enforce their library's Internet  use policy by observing what patrons are viewing and employing  the tap-on-the-shoulder policy.  Under this approach, when  patrons are viewing materials that are inconsistent with the  library's policies, a library staff member approaches them and  asks them to view something else, or may ask them to end their  Internet session.  A patron who does not comply with these  requests, or who repeatedly views materials not permitted under  the library's Internet use policy, may have his or her Internet  or library privileges suspended or revoked.  But many librarians  are uncomfortable with approaching patrons who are viewing  sexually explicit images, finding confrontation unpleasant.  Hence some libraries are reluctant to apply the tap-on-the-  shoulder policy.      The fourth category of methods that public libraries employ  to enforce their Internet use policies, and the one that gives  rise to this case, is the use of Internet filtering software.  According to the June 2000 Survey of Internet Access Management  in Public Libraries, approximately 7% of libraries with public  Internet access had mandated the use of blocking programs by  adult patrons.  Some public libraries provide patrons with the  option of using a blocking program, allowing patrons to decide  whether to engage the program when they or their children access  the Internet.  Other public libraries require their child patrons  to use filtering software, but not their adult patrons.  Filtering software vendors sell their products on a  subscription basis.  The cost of a subscription varies with the  number of computers on which the filtering software will be used.   In 2001, the cost of the Cyber Patrol filtering software was  $1,950 for 100 terminal licenses.  The Greenville County Library  System pays $2,500 per year for the N2H2 filtering software, and  a subscription to the Websense filter costs Westerville Public  Library approximately $1,200 per year.  No evidence was presented on the cost of privacy screens,  recessed monitors, and the tap-on-the-shoulder policy, relative  to the costs of filtering software.  Nor did any of the libraries  proffered by the government present any quantitative evidence on  the relative effectiveness of use of privacy screens to prevent  patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit  material, and the use of filters, discussed below.  No evidence  was presented, for example, comparing the number of patron  complaints in those libraries that have tried both methods.      The librarians who testified at trial whose libraries use  Internet filtering software all provide methods by which their  patrons may ask the library to unblock specific Web sites or  pages.  Of these, only the Tacoma Public Library allows patrons  to request that a URL be unblocked without providing any  identifying information; Tacoma allows patrons to request a URL  by sending an email from the Internet terminal that the patron is  using that does not contain a return email address for the user.   David Biek, the head librarian at the Tacoma Library's main  branch, testified at trial that the library keeps records that  would enable it to know which patrons made unblocking requests,  but does not use that information to connect users with their  requests.  Biek also testified that he periodically scans the  library's Internet use logs to search for: (1) URLs that were  erroneously blocked, so that he may unblock them; or (2) URLs  that should have been blocked, but were not, in order to add them  to a blocked category list.  In the course of scanning the use  logs,  Biek has also found what looked like attempts to access  child pornography.  In two cases, he communicated his findings to  law enforcement and turned over the logs in response to a  subpoena.  At all events, it takes time for librarians to make  decisions about whether to honor patrons' requests to unblock Web  pages.  In the libraries proffered by the defendants, unblocking  decisions sometimes take between 24 hours and a week.  Moreover,  none of these libraries allows unrestricted access to the  Internet pending a determination of the validity of a Web site  blocked by the blocking programs.  A few of the defendants'  proffered libraries represented that"]]]
