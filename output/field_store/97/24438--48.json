These are the  Martyrs of Al-Bakia, who received the crown of glory at the hands of  Al-Muslim,[FN#23] the general of the arch-heretic Yazid[FN#24] The  prayer here recited differs so little from that addressed to the  martyrs of Ohod, that I will not transcribe it. The fifth station is  near the centre of the cemetery at the tomb of Ibrahim, who died, to  the eternal regret of Al-Islam, some say six months old, others in his  second year. He was the son    [p.38] of Mariyah, the Coptic girl, sent as a present to Mohammed by  Jarih, the Mukaukas or governor of Alexandria. The Prophet with his own  hand piled earth upon the grave, and sprinkled it with water,a ceremony  then first performed,disposed small stones upon it, and pronounced the  final salutation. For which reason many holy men were buried in this  part of the cemetery, every one being ambitious to lie in ground which  has been honored by the Apostles hands. Then we visited Al-Nafi Maula,  son of Omar, generally called Imam Nafi al-Kari, or the Koran chaunter;  and near him the great doctor Imam Malik ibn Anas, a native of  Al-Madinah, and one of the most dutiful of her sons. The eighth station  is at the tomb of Ukayl bin Abi Talib, brother of Ali.[FN#25] Then we  visited the spot where lie interred all the Prophets wives, Khadijah,  who lies at Meccah, alone excepted. Mohammed married fifteen wives of  whom nine survived him. After the Mothers of the Moslems, we prayed at  the tombs of Mohammeds daughters, said to be ten in number.    In compliment probably to the Hajj, the beggars mustered strong that  morning at Al-Bakia. Along the walls and at the entrance of each  building squatted ancient dames, all engaged in anxious contemplation  of every approaching face, and in pointing to dirty cotton napkins  spread upon the ground before them, and studded with a few coins, gold,  silver, or copper, according to the expectations of the proprietress.  They raised their voices to demand largesse: some promised to recite  Fatihahs, and the most audacious seized visitors by the skirts of their    [p.39] garments. Fakihs, ready to write Y.S., or anything else demanded  of them, covered the little heaps and eminences of the cemetery, all  begging lustily, and looking as though they would murder you, when told  how beneficent is Allahpolite form of declining to be charitable. At the  doors of the tombs old housewives, and some young ones also, struggled  with you for your slippers as you doffed them, and not unfrequently the  charge of the pair was divided between two. Inside, when the boys were  not loud enough or importunate enough for presents, they were urged on  by the adults and seniors, the relatives of the Khadims and hangers-on.  Unfortunately for me, Shaykh Hamid was renowned for taking charge of  wealthy pilgrims: the result was, that my purse was lightened of three  dollars. I must add that although at least fifty female voices loudly  promised that morning, for the sum of ten parahs each, to supplicate  Allah in behalf of my lame foot, no perceptible good came of their  efforts.    Before leaving Al-Bakia, we went to the eleventh station, [FN#26] the  Kubbat al-Abbasiyah, or Dome of Abbas. Originally built by the Abbaside  Caliphs in A.H. 519, it is a larger and a handsomer building than its  fellows, and it is situated on the right-hand side of the gate as you  enter. The crowd of beggars at the door testified to its importance:  they were attracted by the Persians who assemble here in force to weep  and to pray. Crossing the threshold with some difficulty, I walked  round a mass of tombs which occupies the centre of the building,  leaving but a narrow passage between it and the walls. It is railed  round, and covered over with several Kiswahs of green cloth worked with  white letters: it looked like a confused    [p.40] heap, but it might have appeared irregular to me by the reason  of the mob around. The Eastern portion contains the body of Al-Hasan,  the son of Ali and grandson of the Prophet[FN#27]; the Imam Zayn  al-Abidin, son of Al-Hosayn, and great-grandson to the Prophet; the  Imam Mohammed al-Bakir (fifth Imam), son to Zayn al-Abidin; and his son  the Imam aafar al-Sadikall four descendants of the Prophet, and buried in  the same grave with Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, uncle to Mohammed. It is  almost needless to say that these names are subjects of great  controversy. Al-Musudi mentions that here was found an inscribed stone  declaring it to be the tomb of the Lady Fatimah, of Hasan her brother,  of Ali bin Hosayn, of Mohammed bin Ali, and of Jaafar bin Mohammed. Ibn  Jubayr, describing Al-Bakia, mentions only two in this tomb, Abbas and  Hasan; the head of the latter, he says, in the direction of the formers  feet. Other authors    [p.41] relate that in it, about the ninth century of the Hijrah, was  found a wooden box covered with fresh-looking red felt cloth, with  bright brass nails, and they believe it to have contained the corpse of  Ali, placed here by his own son Hasan.    Standing opposite this mysterious tomb, we repeated, with difficulty by  reason of the Persians weeping, the following supplication:Peace be upon  Ye, O Family of the Prophet! O Lord Abbas, the free from Impurity and  Uncleanness, and Fathers Brother to the Best of Men! And Thou too O Lord  Hasan, Grandson of the Prophet! And thou also O Lord Zayn  al-Abidin[FN#28]! Peace be upon Ye, One and All, for verily God hath  been pleased to deliver You from all Guile, and to purify You with all  Purity. The Mercy of Allah and His Blessings be upon Ye, and verily He  is the Praised, the Mighty! After which, freeing ourselves from the  hands of greedy boys, we turned round and faced the southern wall,  close to which is a tomb attributed to the Lady Fatimah.[FN#29] I will  not repeat the prayer, it being the same as that recited in the Harim.    [p.42] Issuing from the hot and crowded dome, we recovered our slippers  after much trouble, and found that our garments had suffered from the  frantic gesticulations of the Persians. We then walked to the gate of  Al-Bakia, stood facing the cemetery upon an elevated piece of ground,  and delivered the general benediction.    O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! O full of Mercy! O abounding in Beneficence!  Lord of Length (of days), and Prosperity, and Goodness! O Thou, who  when asked, grantest, and when prayed for aid, aidest! Have Mercy upon  the Companions of thy Prophet, of the Muhajirin, and the Ansar! Have  Mercy upon them, One and All!    [p.43] Have Mercy upon bdullah bin Hantal (and so on, specifying their  names), and make Paradise their Resting-place, their Habitation, their  Dwelling, and their Abode! O Allah! accept our Ziyarat, and supply our  Wants, and lighten our Griefs, and restore us to our Homes, and comfort  our Fears, and disappoint not our Hopes, and pardon us, for on no other  do we rely; and let us depart in Thy Faith, and after the Practice of  Thy Prophet, and be Thou satisfied with us! O Allah! forgive our past  Offences, and leave us not to our (evil) Natures during the Glance of  an Eye, or a lesser Time; and pardon us, and pity us, and let us return  to our Houses and Homes safe, (i.e., spiritually and physically)  fortunate, abstaining from what is unlawful, re-established after our  Distresses, and belonging to the Good, thy Servants upon whom is no  Fear, nor do they know Distress. Repentance, O Lord! Repentance, O  Merciful! Repentance, O Pitiful! Repentance before Death, and Pardon  after Death! I beg pardon of Allah! Thanks be to Allah! Praise be to  Allah! Amen, O Lord of the (three) Worlds!    After which, issuing from Al-Bakia,[FN#30] we advanced    [p.44] northwards, leaving the city gate on the left hand, till we came  to a small Kubbah (dome) close to the road. It is visited as containing  the tomb of the Prophets paternal aunts, especially of Safiyah, daughter  of Abd al-Muttalib, sister of Hamzah, and one of the many heroines of  early Al-Islam. Hurrying over our devotions here,for we were tired  indeed,we applied to a Sakka for water, and entered a little  coffee-house near the gate of the town: after which we rode home.    I have now described, at a wearying length I fear, the spots visited by  every Zair at Al-Madinah. The guide-books mention altogether between  fifty and fifty-five Mosques and other holy places, most of which are  now unknown even by name to the citizens. The most celebrated of these  are the few following, which I describe from hearsay. About three miles  to the North-west of the town, close to the Wady al-Akik, lies the  Mosque called Al-KiblataynThe Two Directions of Prayer. Some give this  title to the Masjid al-Takwa at Kuba.[FN#31] Others assert that the  Prophet, after visiting and eating    [p.45] at the house of an old woman named Umm Mabshar, went to pray the  mid-day prayer in the Mosque of the Benu Salmah. He had performed the  prostration with his face towards Jerusalem, when suddenly warned by  revelation he turned Southwards and concluded his orisons in that  direction.[FN#32] I am told it is a mean dome without inner walls,  outer enclosures, or minaret.    The Masjid Benu Zafar (some write the word Tifr) is also called Masjid  al-Baghlahof the She-mule,because, according to Al-Matari, on the ridge  of stone to the south of this Mosque are the marks where the Prophet  leaned his arm, and where the she-mule, Duldul, sent by the Mukaukas as  a present with Mariyah the Coptic girl and Yafur the donkey, placed its  hoofs. At the Mosque was shown a slab upon which the Prophet sat  hearing recitations from the Koran; and historians declare that by  following his example many women have been blessed with  offspring.[FN#33] This Mosque is to the East of Al-Bakia.    The Masjid al-Jumahof Friday,or Al-Anikahof the Sand-heaps,is in the valley  near Kuba, where Mohammed prayed and preached on the first Friday after"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4664"],[0,"Light, Life, and Love: Selections from the German Mystics of the Middle Ages (#8)"],[1,"work. It is an indwelling and a  living together of the soul in God. (255)    Every gift of God makes the soul ready to receive a new gift,  greater than itself. (15)    Yea, since God has never given any gift, in order that man might  rest in the possession of the gift, but gives every gift that He has  given in heaven and on earth, in order that He might be able to give  one gift, which is Himself, so with this gift of grace, and with all  His gifts He will make us ready for the one gift, which is Himself.  (569)    No man is so boorish or stupid or awkward, that he cannot, by God's  grace, unite his will wholly and entirely with God's will. And  nothing more is necessary than that he should say with earnest  longing: O Lord, show me Thy dearest will, and strengthen me to do  it. And God does it, as sure as He lives, and gives him grace in  ever richer fulness, till he comes to perfection, as He gave to the  woman at Jacob's well. Look you, the most ignorant and the lowest of  you all can obtain this from God, before he leaves this church, yea,  before I finish this sermon, as sure as God lives and I am a man.  (187)    O almighty and merciful Creator and good Lord, be merciful to me for  my poor sins, and help me that I may overcome all temptations and  shameful lusts, and may be able to avoid utterly, in thought and  deed, what Thou forbiddest, and give me grace to do and to hold all  that Thou hast commanded. Help me to believe, to hope, and to love,  and in every way to live as Thou willest, as much as Thou willest,  and what Thou willest. (415)    THE WILL    THEN is the will perfect, when it has gone out of itself, and is  formed in the will of God. The more this is so, the more perfect and  true is the will, and in such a will thou canst do all things. (553)    SURRENDER OF THE WILL    YOU should know, that that which God gives to those men who seek to  do His will with all their might, is the best. Of this thou mayest  be as sure, as thou art sure that God lives, that the very best must  necessarily be, and that in no other way could anything better  happen. Even if something else seems better, it would not be so good  for thee, for God wills this and not another way, and this way must  be the best for thee. Whether it be sickness or poverty or hunger or  thirst, or whatever it be, that God hangs over thee or does not hang  over thee--whatever God gives or gives not, that is all what is best  for thee; whether it be devotion or inwardness, or the lack of these  which grieves thee--only set thyself right in this, that thou  desirest the glory of God in all things, and then whatever He does  to thee, that is the best.    Now thou mayest perchance say: How can I tell whether it is the will  of God or not? If it were not the will of God, it would not happen.  Thou couldst have neither sickness nor anything else unless God  willed it. But know that it is God's will that thou shouldst have so  much pleasure and satisfaction therein, that thou shouldst feel no  pain as pain; thou shouldst take it from God as the very best thing,  for it must of necessity be the very best thing for thee. Therefore  I may even wish for it and desire it, and nothing would become me  better than so to do.    If there were a man whom I were particularly anxious to please, and  if I knew for certain that he liked me better in a grey cloak than  in any other, there is no doubt that however good another cloak  might be, I should be fonder of the grey than of all the rest. And  if there were anyone whom I would gladly please, I should do nothing  else in word or deed than what I knew that he liked.    Ah, now consider how your love shows itself! If you loved God, of a  surety nothing would give you greater pleasure than what pleases Him  best, and that whereby His will may be most fully done. And, however  great thy pain or hardship may be, if thou hast not as great  pleasure in it as in comfort or fulness, it is wrong.    We say every day in prayer to our Father, Thy will be done. And yet  when His will is done, we grumble at it, and find no pleasure in His  will. If our prayers were sincere, we should certainly think His  will, and what He does, to be the best, and that the very best had  happened to us. (134)    Those who accept all that the Lord send, as the very best, remain  always in perfect peace, for in them God's will has become their  will. This is incomparably better than for our will to become God's  will. For when thy will becomes God's will--if thou art sick, thou  wishest not to be well contrary to God's will, but thou wishest that  it were God's will that thou shouldest be well. And so in other  things. But when God's will becomes thy will--then thou art sick: in  God's name; thy friend dies: in God's name! (55)    SUFFERING    MEN who love God are so far from complaining of their sufferings,  that their complaint and their suffering is rather because the  suffering which God's will has assigned them is so small. All their  blessedness is to suffer by God's will, and not to have suffered  something, for this is the loss of suffering. This is why I said,  Blessed are they who are willing to suffer for righteousness, not,  Blessed are they who have suffered. (434)    All that a man bears for God's sake, God makes light and sweet for  him. (45)    If all was right with you, your sufferings would no longer be  suffering, but love and comfort. (442)    If God could have given to men anything more noble than suffering,  He would have redeemed mankind with it: otherwise, you must say that  my Father was my enemy, if he knew of anything nobler than  suffering. (338)    True suffering is a mother of all the virtues. (338)    SIN    DEADLY sin is a death of the soul. To die is to lose life. But God  is the life of the soul; since then deadly sin separates us from  God, it is a death of the soul.    Deadly sin is also an unrest of the heart. Everything can rest only  in its proper place. But the natural place of the soul is God; as St  Augustine says, Lord, thou hast made us for Thyself, and our heart  is restless till it finds rest in Thee. But deadly sin separates us  from God; therefore it is an unrest of the heart. Deadly sin is also  a sickness of the faculties, when a man can never stand up alone for  the weight of his sins, nor ever resist falling into sin. Therefore  deadly sin is a sickness of the faculties. Deadly sin is also a  blindness of the sense, in that it suffers not a man to know the  shortness of the pleasures of lust, nor the length of the punishment  in hell, nor the eternity of joys in heaven. Deadly sin is also a  death of all graces; for as soon as a deadly sin takes place, a man  becomes bare of all graces. (217)    Every creature must of necessity abide in God; if we fall out of the  hands of his mercy, we fall into the hands of His justice. We must  ever abide in Him. What madness then is it to wish not to be with  Him, without whom thou canst not be! (169)    CONTENTMENT    A GREAT teacher once told a story in his preaching about a man who  for eight years besought God to show him a man who would make known  to him the way of truth. While he was in this state of anxiety there  came a voice from God and spake to him: Go in front of the church,  and there shalt thou find a man who will make known to thee the way  of truth. He went, and found a poor man whose feet were chapped and  full of dirt, and all his clothes were hardly worth  twopence-halfpenny. He greeted this poor man and said to him, God  give thee a good morning. The poor man answered, I never had a bad  morning. The other said, God give thee happiness. How answerest thou  that? The poor man answered, I was never unhappy. The first then  said, God send thee blessedness. How answerest thou that? I was  never unblessed, was the answer. Lastly the questioner said, God  give thee health! Now enlighten me, for I cannot understand it. And  the poor man replied, When thou saidst to me, may God give thee a  good morning, I said I never had a bad morning. If I am hungry, I  praise God for it; if I am cold, I praise God for it; if I am  distressful and despised, I praise God for it; and that is why I  never had a bad morning. When thou askedst God to give me happiness,  I answered that I had never been unhappy; for what God gives or  ordains for me, whether it be His love or suffering, sour or sweet,  I take it all from God as being the best, and that is why I was  never unhappy. Thou saidst further, May God make thee blessed, and I  said, I was never unblessed, for I have given up my will so entirely  to God's will, that what God wills, that I also will, and that is  why I was never unblessed, because I willed alone God's will. Ah!  dear fellow, replied the man; but if God should will to throw thee  into hell, what wouldst thou say then? He replied, Throw me into  hell! Then I would resist Him. But even if He threw me into hell, I  should still have two arms wherewith to embrace Him. One arm is true  humility, which I should place under Him, and with the arm of love I  should embrace Him. And he concluded, I would rather be in hell and  possess God, than in the kingdom of heaven without Him. (623)    DETACHMENT    THE man who has submitted his will and purposes entirely to God,  carries God with him in all his works and in all circumstances.  Therein can no man hinder him, for he neither aims at nor enjoys  anything else, save God. God is united with Him in all his purposes  and designs. Even as no manifoldness can dissipate God, so nothing  can dissipate such a man, or destroy his unity. Man, therefore,  should take God with him in all things; God should be always present  to his mind and will and affections. The same disposition that thou  hast in church or in thy cell, thou shouldst keep and maintain in a  crowd, and amid the unrest and manifoldness of the world.    Some people pride themselves on their detachment from mankind, and  are"]]]
