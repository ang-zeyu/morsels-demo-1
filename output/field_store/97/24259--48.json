Another record is of hikes taken by campers during the summer. The  route, the time of starting, the hour of returning, the number of girls  who took the hike and any special point of interest noticed on the way,  may be recorded.      The Keeping of Records    [Illustration:    Twin Lake Council of Girl Scouts    Western Lane, New England    I hereby make application for:              Name............................

Date..........                   Signed.........................                           Relation:    E. Application Form]    The keeping of the Scout's application, deposit, board and  transportation record plus the responsibility of so planning that there  is never a vacant cot in camp is a matter which takes a great deal of  time at best, but which can be more easily done if a good system is  used. The records are generally kept in the office of the Local Council  under whose direction the camp is opened and run. Application blanks,  (Cut E) should be filed according to date of entering camp and kept on  file under the heading \"In Camp,\" as long as the Scout is there, then  transferred to the \"Left Camp\" file and kept for reference.    Ten days prior to the date of entering camp a follow-up notice should be  sent to each Scout who should report to the local office, pay for  transportation, receive tickets for same, pay for first week's board and  receive a receipt for same.    The identification tag which must be taken to camp and given to the  Director upon arrival should be filled in and given to the Scout, when  she leaves.    In addition to the individual account card (Cut F.) record, all money  received for deposits, transportation or board should be entered in a  camp day book and deposited under camp account.    Any donations received for camp may also be entered in this book and  deposited as \"Donations.\"    [Illustration:         ---------------------------------------------------------------      |Name...........................................................|      |                                                               |      |Address........................................................|      |---------+------------------------------+-------+-------+------|      |         |                              |       |       |      |      |  1920   |                              | Money | Check | Cash |      |  Dates  |                              | Order |       |      |      | Mar.  1 |Filed Application, Paid       |       |       |      |      |         |     Deposit                  |  1.00 |       |      |      | July  1 | Enters Camp                  |       |       |      |      | July 22 | Leaves Camp                  |       |       |      |      | June 28 | Paid for Transportation      |       |       |  2.00|      | June 21 | Paid for first week's board  |  5.00 |       |      |      | July  1 | Paid for second week's board |       |  6.00 |      |      | July 15 | Paid for third week's board  |  6.00 |       |      |       ---------+------------------------------+-------+-------+------    F. Individual Account Card]    The Local Office should notify the camp Director at least two days  before sending Scouts into camp, as to the number and the names of  Scouts who will report to her, and thus give the Director time, if space  allows, to arrange for any girl or girls who may desire to remain in  camp for an additional week.    [Illustration: THE BREAD LINE]    The Director in turn must send to the Local Office a list of all Scouts  leaving camp that any unexpected vacancies may be filled from the  waiting list and accounts adjusted.      The Camp Budget    Every camp should be run on a budget; that is, according to a plan of  expenditure made on the best information available. Even if  circumstances alter the original plan, as they are apt to do, each  dollar whose expenditure is planned for will be found to bring in  considerably more return than the casually disbursed one.    The following items to be considered in any camp budget are given in  order of their numerical importance:              1. Food. Includes carriage cost.              2. Equipment. General and Special. The General and            Special Equipment will be considered permanent            camp property requiring renewal and replacement at            various annual rates.              3. Transportation. This will cover all railway            charges and boat fares for Scouts and counsellors,            and shipping charges on general merchandise other            than food.              4. Rental or Purchase Price of Land. This may or            may not include rent on the houses, and will vary            accordingly.

Director not included, paid yearly 8 volunteers    [Illustration: G. Camp Budget]              5. Salaries. These will vary according to the size            and character of the camp and especially according            to the amount of volunteer service obtainable. In            all cases they are calculated in addition to            living and traveling expenses. As camps become            more numerous the demand for professionally            trained counsellors will ultimately exclude the            possibility of depending entirely on volunteer            service. This item may therefore be expected to            increase.              6. Canteen. All the expenses for this, including            service and accounting, should be more than            covered by receipts.              7. Cartage. This will vary according to the type            of road and distances involved.              8. Wages. A camp of any size demands certain            permanent forms of service which cannot be given            by the campers. This is not a good point at which            to economize.              9. Casual Labor. This must be provided for            especially at the opening and closing of camp.              10. Opening and Closing. This item covers certain            forms of skilled labor; also transportation and            clerical charges.              11. Stamps. Receipts should cover cost less office            supply.              12. Motor Upkeep. An automobile will be found to            more than pay for itself, and will undoubtedly            soon become an obvious prime necessity.              13. Boats. Boats may more profitably be rented            than bought as the expense of storage and repairs            is easier borne by a large company.              14. Printing. It pays to have all camp forms and            circulars well printed.    [Illustration: RACE BETWEEN WASHER AND DRYER]              15. Telephone. This is a necessity and can be made            to pay for itself.              16. Storage. Careful storage saves equipment. Do            not forget insurance.              17. All Other. Incidentals may be expected to take            up three or four per cent of available funds.    The actual cost of a large camp near New York is computed in Cut G, all  figures being given in round numbers and based on three years'  successful running. Absolute numbers mean little when considering  conditions throughout the country, particularly in this age of rapidly  shifting and climbing prices. Therefore, the figures are also expressed  in terms of the distribution of one thousand dollars, during the first  and also the following years.    It will be noted that food is always the most expensive item. It is  also the common basis for comparison. Equipment which is second in cost  the first year, drops to fifth place in the following years. With  reasonable care equipment should last seven"]]]
