These places belonging to this kingdom are the  following. In the beginning of this kingdom on the coast outside of  this sea of Persia, is:--    First Calhat,[71] a very large town of handsome houses, and well  situated; the inhabitants are rich nobles and merchants: it is  forty-four leagues from Cape Fasalhat. Thirty-two leagues further on  there is another small place called Tybi, which has good water with  which the ships navigating all this coast provide themselves.    Twenty-five leagues further on is another small place called Daxnia,  also a seaport.    Thirty leagues further on is another large place which is a very  good town of much trade in merchandise, which is called Curiat,[72]  in which, as well as in the others in the neighbourhood, there is  plenty of meat, wheat, dates, and other fruit in abundance: there  are plenty of horses, which are bred in the country, and they are  very good, and the Moors of Ormuz come to buy them for exportation  to India.    Leaving this town of Curiat, at twelve leagues along the coast is  another place with a fortress which is called Sar,[73] which the  King of Ormuz keeps there.    Having doubled the Cape of Resalcate, the coast turns to the sea of  Persia. Forty leagues further on from this cape is another town upon  the coast itself called Mazquate. It is a large town, and of very  honourable people, and of much trade in merchandise, and a place of  great fisheries: they catch large fish there, which they export  dried and salted to other parts.    Going along the coast further on to the sea of Persia there is at a  distance of ten leagues another place called Sohar.[74]    Leaving this town of Sohar, further inland from the coast, at  fourteen leagues off is another fortress of the King of Ormuz called  Rosach; and with these fortresses this king is better able to keep  all this country in subjection.    Having passed the fortress of Rosach, there is another fortress  called Nahel twelve leagues off.    Twelve leagues further on is another place they call Madeha; it is a  small place, of few inhabitants, inside the mouth of the Sea of  Persia, thirty leagues to the south-west.[75]    Further on, there is a large place of many inhabitants called  Corfasan,[76] around which and the other neighbouring places are  many very agreeable country houses belonging to the chief men and  most honoured of the Moors of Ormuz, who come during certain months  of the year there to repose, and to collect their provisions, and  enjoy their fruit.    Fifteen leagues further on there is another place on the coast,  called Dadena.    As much again further on to the south-west, another place called  Daba. Further on, on the coast to the south-west by west, at a  distance of lxxxv leagues, is another very large town called  Julfar,[77] where there are many very respectable people, and many  merchants and sailors. And there they fish up many large pearls and  seed pearls, which the merchants of the city of Ormuz come there to  buy, to carry them to India and other parts. This place is one of  much trade, and produces a great deal to the king of Ormuz.    Further along the coast of the Persian Sea, in the before-mentioned  inner part, are three other places belonging to the king of Ormuz:  Racolhiman,[78] which is a good town, at a distance of twenty-four  leagues, and another beyond this, called Melquehoan,[79] and six  leagues further on there is a fortress called Calba,[80] which the  king maintains to defend his country from the Bedouins, who live in  the interior of the country, and who are governed by sheikhs; and at  times they go against these towns of the kingdom of Ormuz, and make  war upon them, and sometimes they make them rebel against the king.    This king of Ormuz possesses, besides these places already  mentioned, on the coast of Arabia, many other towns in the country  of Persia, on the sea-coast, and in the midst of the Persian Sea  many islands inhabited by Moors, in which he has many large towns,  very rich and handsome, all of which are named separately further  on, and afterwards the island and city of Ormuz and its customs are  mentioned.    On this coast the king of Ormuz has a town called Baha,[81] in which  he maintains his governors.    Having passed this place, further along the coast is another place  called Dexar.    Further on another place called Xahen.    Further on another place called Ygun.[82]    Further on another place called El-guadun.    Further on another place called Nabani,[83] from which place they  carry much water to drink to Ormuz, because there is no drinkable  water there; and from this and all those other places they carry to  Ormuz all its supplies.    Further on is another place called Guan-meda, and from there further  on there are also some other places belonging to the king of Ormuz,  which are the following--Lefete, Quesebi,[84] and from here further  on the coast turns to the north-west by north as far as the mouth of  the river Eufrates, and it begins here to be a wide estuary.  Berohu,[85] Caljar, Xuza, Mohimasim,[86] Lima,[87] Gorbaz, Alguefa,  Carmon.[88] Which lasts two hundred and forty leagues, and then  Bazera, a castle of Sophi. At the entrance of the river Eufrates the  land turns to the sea in a southerly direction eighty leagues, and  then returns as much again to the north, and after that turns again  to the south, when there begin these towns--Cohomo, Barque Guex,[89]  Ganguan, Basido,[90] Goxtaque, Conch, Conga, Ebrahemi,[91] and as  far as this there are one hundred and sixty-five leagues, and after  that Xenase,[92] Menahao Xamile, Leytam, Bamtani, Doani,[93] and  from this point the coast trends to the east for a distance of  thirty leagues as far as Lorom.[94] Between these places there are  many large towns with much trade, and very respectable inhabitants,  and great merchants; and many castles, which the King of Ormuz  maintains for the defence of his country, and they are all on the  coast of the Persian Sea. They are places abundantly supplied with  meat and wheaten bread, barley, vines, and all other things which  are found in our parts, and many dates; and the inhabitants of these  towns are white, and very polite people; they dress in long clothes  of silk and cotton stuffs and camelots; and this is a very rich  country.      THE ISLANDS OF THE KINGDOM OF ORMUZ.    In the mouth of this sea of Persia there are the following islands  belonging to the king of Ormuz. Cuyx, Andrany,[95] Baxeal,  _Quiro_,[96] _Lar_,[97] Cojar,[98] Tomon,[99] _Firror_ Guolar,  Melugan,[100] Gory, Queximi,[101] Baharem.[102]    These two islands of Queximi and Baharem are large; and Queximi has  eight inhabited towns and has plenty of provisions. Baharem has a  large town of many Moors, important and honourable personages. And  it is distant from Lorom to the north-east xxxiv leagues, and to the  island of Queximi fifty leagues of channel; and between it and the  mainland from two to four leagues; and after that the coast turns  between north-east and east, until the island of Ormuz for xxxv  leagues, of which island mention is made lower down.[103]    Merchants from many parts reside in this island, and it is situated  in the middle of this sea, and many ships with great merchandise  sail to it; and here and in the neighbourhood much seed pearl and  many pearls are produced, and they fish them on the island itself,  from which there is a great profit to the inhabitants; and the king  draws from this island and from all the others large revenues. The  merchants of Ormuz go to this island of Baharem to buy the pearls  and seed pearl for India and other parts where they find it  profitable, and for the kingdom of Narsinga; and also those of  Persia and Arabia go there to buy them, and in all this sea of  Persia these pearls are found, but not in such quantity as in this  island of Baharem.      COUNTRY OF SHEIKH ISMAIL.    After passing these countries along the coast of Persia, there are  many towns, places, and villages of the Moors, very handsome and  rich enough. From here further on it is no longer the country of the  king of Ormuz, but belongs to other lords, of whom we do not possess  so much information, except that Xeque Yzmael[104] subjugates and  governs them. He is a Moor, and a young man, who in a short time has  subjugated these parts, and a great part of Persia and Arabia, and  many kingdoms and lordships of the Moors, not being a king nor the  son of a king, except that he was only a sheikh of the house and  lineage of Aly, the brother-in-law[105] of Mahomed; and, being poor,  he united with other young Moors, and they took up the habit of  going without clothes, which is a custom amongst them; they  abandoned their property, honours, and clothes, and only covered  themselves with skins of goats, and leopards, and deer with the fur,  which many are in the habit of carrying, and they mark their arms  and breasts with many scars of burns; and they carry heavy iron  chains, and in their hands some weapons, different from those of  other people, such as small battle-axes of much workmanship, and  iron maces; they go as pilgrims, and do not sustain themselves "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#8)"],[1,"thing essential to a dignified  retreat. You must know the way out. It was the lack of that knowledge  that kept me standing there, looking more foolish than anyone has ever  looked since the world began. I could not retire by way of the hedge.  If I could have leaped the hedge with a single debonair bound, that  would have been satisfactory. But the hedge was high, and I did not  feel capable at the moment of achieving a debonair bound over a  footstool.    The man saved the situation. He seemed to possess that magnetic power  over his fellows which marks the born leader. Under his command we  became an organised army. The common object, the pursuit of the elusive  Aunt Elizabeth, made us friends. In the first minute of the proceedings  the Irishman was addressing me as \"me dear boy,\" and the man, who had  introduced himself as Mr. Chase--a lieutenant, I learned later, in His  Majesty's Navy--was shouting directions to me by name. I have never  assisted at any ceremony at which formality was so completely dispensed  with. The ice was not merely broken; it was shivered into a million  fragments.    \"Go in and drive her out, Garnet,\" shouted Mr. Chase. \"In my direction  if you can. Look out on the left, Phyllis.\"    Even in that disturbing moment I could not help noticing his use of the  Christian name. It seemed to me more than sinister. I did not like the  idea of dashing young lieutenants in the senior service calling a girl  Phyllis whose eyes had haunted me since I had first seen them.    Nevertheless, I crawled into the bushes and administered to Aunt  Elizabeth a prod in the lower ribs--if hens have lower ribs. The more I  study hens, the more things they seem able to get along without--which  abruptly disturbed her calm detachment. She shot out at the spot where  Mr. Chase was waiting with his coat off, and was promptly enveloped in  that garment and captured.    \"The essence of strategy,\" observed Mr. Chase approvingly, \"is  surprise. A neat piece of work!\"    I thanked him. He deprecated my thanks. He had, he said, only done his  duty, as expected to by England. He then introduced me to the elderly  Irishman, who was, it seemed, a professor at Dublin University, by  name, Derrick. Whatever it was that he professed, it was something that  did not keep him for a great deal of his time at the University. He  informed me that he always spent his summers at Combe Regis.    \"I was surprised to see you at Combe Regis,\" I said. \"When you got out  at Yeovil, I thought I had seen the last of you.\"    I think I am gifted beyond other men as regards the unfortunate turning  of sentences.    \"I meant,\" I added, \"I was afraid I had.\"    \"Ah, of course,\" he said, \"you were in our carriage coming down. I was  confident I had seen you before. I never forget a face.\"    \"It would be a kindness,\" said Mr. Chase, \"if you would forget Garnet's  as now exhibited. You seem to have collected a good deal of the scenery  coming through that hedge.\"    \"I was wondering----\" I said. \"A wash--if I might----\"    \"Of course, me boy, of course,\" said the professor. \"Tom, take Mr.  Garnet off to your room, and then we'll have lunch. You'll stay to  lunch, Mr. Garnet?\"    I thanked him, commented on possible inconvenience to his arrangements,  was overruled, and went off with my friend the lieutenant to the house.  We imprisoned Aunt Elizabeth in the stables, to her profound  indignation, gave directions for lunch to be served to her, and made  our way to Mr. Chase's room.    \"So you've met the professor before?\" he said, hospitably laying out a  change of raiment for me--we were fortunately much of a height and  build.    \"I have never spoken to him,\" I said. \"We travelled down from London in  the same carriage.\"    \"He's a dear old boy, if you rub him the right way. But--I'm telling  you this for your good and guidance; a man wants a chart in a strange  sea--he can cut up rough. And, when he does, he goes off like a  four-point-seven and the population for miles round climbs trees. I  think, if I were you, I shouldn't mention Sir Edward Carson at lunch.\"    I promised that I would try to avoid the temptation.    \"In fact, you'd better keep off Ireland altogether. It's the safest  plan. Any other subject you like. Chatty remarks on Bimetallism would  meet with his earnest attention. A lecture on What to do with the Cold  Mutton would be welcomed. But not Ireland. Shall we do down?\"    We got to know each other at lunch.    \"Do you hunt hens,\" asked Tom Chase, who was mixing the salad--he was  one of those men who seemed to do everything a shade better than anyone  else--\"for amusement or by your doctor's orders? Many doctors, I  believe, insist on it.\"    \"Neither,\" I said, \"and especially not for amusement. The fact is, I've  been lured down here by a friend of mine who has started a chicken  farm--\"    I was interrupted. All three of them burst out laughing. Tom Chase  allowed the vinegar to trickle on to the cloth, missing the salad-bowl  by a clear two inches.    \"You don't mean to tell us,\" he said, \"that you really come from the  one and only chicken farm? Why, you're the man we've all been praying  to meet for days past. You're the talk of the town. If you can call  Combe Regis a town. Everybody is discussing you. Your methods are new  and original, aren't they?\"    \"Probably. Ukridge knows nothing about fowls. I know less. He considers  it an advantage. He says our minds ought to be unbiassed.\"    \"Ukridge!\" said the professor. \"That was the name old Dawlish, the  grocer, said. I never forget a name. He is the gentleman who lectures  on the management of poultry? You do not?\"    I hastened to disclaim any such feat. I had never really approved of  these infernal talks on the art of chicken-farming which Ukridge had  dropped into the habit of delivering when anybody visited our farm. I  admit that it was a pleasing spectacle to see my managing director in a  pink shirt without a collar and very dirty flannel trousers lecturing  the intelligent native; but I had a feeling that the thing tended to  expose our ignorance to men who had probably had to do with fowls from  their cradle up.    \"His lectures are very popular,\" said Phyllis Derrick with a little  splutter of mirth.    \"He enjoys them,\" I said.    \"Look here, Garnet,\" said Tom Chase, \"I hope you won't consider all  these questions impertinent, but you've no notion of the thrilling  interest we all take--at a distance--in your farm. We have been talking  of nothing else for a week. I have dreamed of it three nights running.  Is Mr. Ukridge doing this as a commercial speculation, or is he an  eccentric millionaire?\"    \"He's not a millionaire yet, but I believe he intends to be one  shortly, with the assistance of the fowls. But you mustn't look on me  as in any way responsible for the arrangements at the farm. I am merely  a labourer. The brainwork of the business lies in Ukridge's department.  As a matter of fact, I came down here principally in search of golf.\"    \"Golf?\" said Professor Derrick, with the benevolent approval of the  enthusiast towards a brother. \"I'm glad you play golf. We must have a  round together.\"    \"As soon as ever my professional duties will permit,\" I said gratefully.     * * * * *    There was croquet after lunch,--a game of which I am a poor performer.  Phyllis Derrick and I played the professor and Tom Chase. Chase was a  little better than myself; the professor, by dint of extreme  earnestness and care, managed to play a fair game; and Phyllis was an  expert.    \"I was reading a book,\" she said, as we stood together watching the  professor shaping at his ball at the other end of the lawn, \"by an  author of the same surname as you, Mr. Garnet. Is he a relation of  yours?\"    \"My name is Jeremy, Miss Derrick.\"    \"Oh, you wrote it?\" She turned a little pink. \"Then you must have--oh,  nothing.\"    \"I couldn't help it, I'm afraid.\"    \"Did you know what I was going to say?\"    \"I guessed. You were going to say that I must have heard your  criticisms in the train. You were very lenient, I thought.\"    \"I didn't like your heroine.\"    \"No. What is a 'creature,' Miss Derrick?\"    \"Pamela in your book is a 'creature,'\" she replied unsatisfactorily.    Shortly after this the game came somehow to an end. I do not understand  the intricacies of croquet. But Phyllis did something brilliant and  remarkable with the balls, and we adjourned for tea. The sun was  setting as I left to return to the farm, with Aunt Elizabeth stored  neatly in a basket in my hand. The air was deliciously cool, and full  of that strange quiet which follows soothingly on the skirts of a  broiling midsummer afternoon. Far away, seeming to come from another  world, a sheep-bell tinkled, deepening the silence. Alone in a sky of  the palest blue there gleamed a small, bright star.    I addressed this star.    \"She was certainly very nice to me. Very nice indeed.\" The star said  nothing.    \"On the other hand, I take it that, having had a decent up-bringing,  she would have been equally polite to any other man whom she had  happened to meet at her father's house. Moreover, I don't feel  altogether easy in my mind about that naval chap. I fear the worst.\"    The star winked.    \"He calls her Phyllis,\" I said.    \"Charawk!\" chuckled Aunt Elizabeth from her basket, in that beastly  cynical, satirical way which has made her so disliked by all  right-thinking people.        CHAPTER VIII    A LITTLE DINNER AT UKRIDGE'S    \"Edwin comes to-day,\" said Mrs. Ukridge.    \"And the Derricks,\" said Ukridge, sawing at the bread in his energetic  way. \"Don't forget the Derricks, Millie.\"    \"No, dear. Mrs. Beale is going to give us a very nice dinner. We talked  it over yesterday.\"    \"Who is Edwin?\" I asked.    We were finishing breakfast on the second morning after my visit to the  Derricks. I had related my adventures to the staff of the farm on my  return, laying stress on the merits of our "]]]
