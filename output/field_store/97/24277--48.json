Clanton, a cowman, living seven miles south  of Harding, S. D. One day I was in his shop putting a coyote hide on  a stretcher, when one of his neighbors drove up and asked Mr. Clanton  if he had a rifle. He said, 'Yes, there is a wolfer here who has  one.' 'Why,' his friend said, 'there are two big grey wolves just  back over that hill.'\"    \"I waited for no more but ran for my horse and gun. Clanton saw me  going to the barn and told me to bring his horse. Now I was not long  in getting those horses and we were soon on their trail. We followed  their tracks about one and one-half miles when we sighted them.  Picking out the largest of the two we both rode after him. The wolf  started west towards some bad lands, but Mr. Clanton was riding a  good young horse and he soon turned the wolf south, but now he was  headed straight for a wire fence.    \"Mr. Clanton would have succeeded in turning him again, but he struck  a ditch full of snow, so the wolf got inside the pasture but I was  fixed for wire fences. I had my trapping axe on my saddle and soon  made a gate that we did not stop to fix up. We had run the wolf five  or six miles by this time, and our horses were pretty well winded. So  we pulled them up and let them take a slower gait until we got  through the other side of the pasture.    \"As I said before, Mr. Clanton was riding the best horse, so he kept  the outside while I took advantage of the cuts. Mr. Clanton was just  far enough ahead of me to make one throw at the wolf with his rope,  but he missed him. The wolf cut in behind his horse, when I rode in  front of him and put a 30-40 soft point in his head. He was a very  large grey wolf. His hide stretched 6 1/2 feet long. On the way back  we saw three more wolves and two coyotes.\"    We give the following spirited account of a wolf hunt which occurred  in South Dakota:    \"Will tell about one of my hunts behind a pair of wolf hounds that  are certainly right when it comes to coyotes. I left my home here in  Illinois on the 12th of December and arrived at Presho, S. D., early  the 14th, where my friends met me, and we started for the ranch,  which is about midway between Presho and Pierre.    \"When we got to the reservation fence (Brule Reservation), we kept a  lookout for coyote signs, and located a place that we thought would  be all right, and planned a hunt for the following Saturday.    \"The day proved all that could be desired, so we started out at noon.  Earl, Claude, Mort, Chas., Sheldon and myself, with the two hounds,  Ike and Lucy. A ride of about two miles brought us to the  reservation, and the hunt was on.    \"Our outfit consisted of our saddled ponies and team and buggy, and  by standing up in the buggy seat we located two coyotes on the side  hill playing in the high grass. A circle around the hill and Lucy  discovered them and was off with Ike a second, as he was not as fast  as Lucy.    \"Away we all go across the prairie with the team and buggy following  the reservation fence to keep the coyote away from the fence. It was  a short chase, as Lucy soon had Mr. Coyote by the hind leg and turned  him on his back quicker than it can be told, and Ike being close at  hand soon had him by the throat, so by the time we could get out  horses stopped and turned Mr. Coyote was no more.    \"After skinning, we started for the buggy and Sheldon reported coyote  No. 2 headed south down the draw, and Earl went after him around the  hill and drove him back our way.    \"A shout from that direction and the dogs have discovered No. 2 and  we are away with Lucy in the lead, and this time we are not far  behind, so that when the dogs got him we were right there, and the  coyote not much hurt, so he gets a rope halter and is stowed away  alive under the buggy seat.    \"The dogs are panting hard and are very thirsty, with no water closer  than five miles, so we head for home, but not far away on the  hillside another one is seen and the buggy starts toward the left to  head him toward the ranch, so the dogs will be running toward home  when they jump him.    \"This time Ike catches sight and is off, and Lucy cuts across to head  him off. It is a short chase, for old Ike soon has his favorite hold  and all is over.    \"After skinning we started for home and as I hadn't ridden much for  over a year you can gamble I was feeling pretty sore, for the pace a  pack of hounds set isn't slow by a long shot. On driving into the  yard the dogs were not slow about getting into the house and lying  down.    \"The live coyote we tied to the buggy wheel, and while I was gone  after a strap and chain he bit the rope off and 'cut the mustard' for  parts unknown with about a foot of rope still hanging to him.    \"We have good hunting here in the spring and fall, plenty of chickens  and, some ducks and geese, with lots of jack rabbits and (Flicker  Tails), prairie dogs, and their side partners, owls and rattlers.    \"Our outfit is the bar circle outfit, O and I think our Holstein  cattle are among the first herds in the state. Have since this hunt  disposed of my interest in the O but still have a bunch of cattle at  Presho, which supply the town with milk.\"        CHAPTER VII.    STILL HUNTING WOLVES AND COYOTES.    Hunting wolves with dogs, as described in the preceding chapter is  certainly exciting sport but it is doubtful if it is as remunerative  as still-hunting, especially in the rough sections where hunting with  dogs is almost impracticable. In parts of the country where wolves  and coyotes are plentiful, as they are in many of the thinly settled  portions of the West, they may be still hunted at all times of the  year. In the heavily timbered parts of the North, this method is  practical only in winter.    The outfit that is needed for still-hunting in the West is one or  more good saddle horses and the necessary equipment and a good, high  powered rifle. A pair of field glasses will also be useful, but some  hunters equip their rifles with telescope sights and the field glass  is unnecessary. Hunters differ in their views, and with regard to  rifles especially, there is a great difference of opinion. What one  believes to be perfect, and which answers his purpose admirably,  another has no use for whatever.    The arm selected should, however, have considerable power, and the  flight of the bullet should be rapid, with a low trajectory. On the  Western Plains the atmosphere is so light and transparent, and there  is such a sameness to the surface of the country that one may easily  be deceived in distances and with the high powered long-ranged rifle,  there is less liability of errors, as the accurate estimating of  distances is not necessary.    A gun of rapid action is also to be recommended and beyond all doubt  the automatic acting arms are superior for shooting at running game.  Personally, if the writer were selecting an arm for this kind of  hunting, a high powered automatic rifle would be chosen, and it would  be fitted with a small bead front sight and hunting peep rear sight.  For use on horse back the shorter barrels are to be preferred.    In speaking of the outfit it is presumed that the wolf hunter would  be a resident of the western country and would be hunting from home  or anyway, making his headquarters at some ranch and hunting from  there. If, however, he wants to go out into virgin territory, or if a  stranger, he might find it necessary to camp out and in that case he  would require a complete camping outfit. Some of the western wolfers  use covered wagons for camps and this style of camp is very  convenient as it may be moved easily, but if the surface of the  country is very rough, this plan is not practical. In that case a  tent would be needed and the hunter would use a pack horse in moving  camp.      [Illustration: A Still Hunter and His Outfit.]    Speaking of saddle horses, in the more arid parts of the wolf  country, the vegetation is scanty and horses require considerable  time in which to rustle food. For that reason the same horse can not  be used each day and one should have several so that each would have  plenty of time to recuperate, after use. If one can obtain horses  that will allow one to shoot from the saddle, so much the better. No  special knowledge of hunting is required, but one should be expert in  the use of the rifle, and should also be a good rider. All that is  necessary is to ride over the rougher parts of the country, where  wolves are most likely to be seen, and keep a sharp lookout for the  game. It is always best to hunt to windward as one can approach  closer to the game.    Where the bounty is sufficient to make summer hunting profitable, we  would recommend this style of hunting at that time of year. In  summer, hunting with dogs is not as simple a matter as in winter and  trapping is not as good as during the colder part of the year. For  coyotes, still hunting is a very successful method in parts of the  country where the animals are plentiful and there is probably no  place in which the method could be used to better advantage than in  the sheep-raising district of Montana and Wyoming. There coyotes may  be sighted every day and if the hunter would make a practice of  following up the large herds of sheep to the summer range, he would  always be sure of an abundance of game.    One is most likely to sight coyotes by riding along the coulees and  over the rougher ground. About prairie dog towns are excellent  places, as there they will frequently be found looking for the little  inhabitants of the burrows. Other good places are the ragged, craggy  parts of the Bad Lands and in the sage brush along the watercourses.    In winter one may follow the tracks in the snow and will stand a  better chance of securing the game. While still hunting alone might  not prove a very profitable method of hunting if one were hunting for  bounty, it should always be used"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34523"],[0,"Fishes of Chautauqua, Cowley and Elk Counties, Kansas (#8)"],[1,"res. Between the Fall River and  Big Caney River systems is the Elk River, from which there is no record  of the rosyface shiner. Perhaps its absence is related to the  intermittent condition of this stream at present. The Elk River is poor  in spring-fed tributaries, which seem to be favorite environs of the  rosyface shiner.    _N. rubellus_ was taken by Minna Jewell and Frank Jobes in Silver Creek  on June 30, 1925 (UMMZ 67818). The shiner was not found in any stream  west of the Big Caney system in my collections.    In Oklahoma, Hall (1952:57) found _N. rubellus_ in upland tributaries on  the east side of Grand River and not in the lowland tributaries on the  west side. Martin and Campbell (1953:51) characterize _N. rubellus_ as  preferring riffle channels in moderate to fast current in the Black  River, Missouri. It is the only species so characterized by them which  was taken in my collections. Moore and Paden (1950:84) state \"_Notropis  rubellus_ is one of the most abundant fishes of the Illinois River,  being found in all habitats but showing a distinct preference for fast  water....\"      #Notropis topeka# (Gilbert): Two specimens (formerly Indiana University  4605) of the Topeka shiner labeled \"Winfield, Kansas\" are now at the  University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. Collector and other data are  not given. Evermann and Fordice (1886:185) noted that two specimens of  _N. topeka_ were taken from Sand Creek near Newton in Harvey County, but  do not list it from Cowley County near Winfield. They deposited their  fish in the museum of Indiana University.      #Notropis umbratilis# (Girard): Stations G-1, G-3, G-4, G-7, G-8, G-9,  G-12, G-14, B-2, B-3, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10,  C-11, C-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-5, M-1, M-2 (J&J,  C-131, C-132).    The redfin shiner flourished in all the streams surveyed except the  Arkansas and Walnut Rivers. _N. umbratilis_ has been found in upland  tributaries of the Walnut River, some of which originate in terrain  similar to that in which Elk River, Big Caney River, and Grouse Creek  originate. (Collection C-26-51 by Cross on Durechon Creek, October 7,  1951.) This suggests downstream reduction in relative numbers of this  species, a tendency which also seemed to exist on both Big Caney River  and Grouse Creek. _N. umbratilis_ was the most abundant species in Big  Caney River except at the lowermost stations where it was surpassed in  relative abundance by _N. lutrensis_ and _Gambusia affinis_.    _N. umbratilis_ was a pool-dweller, becoming more concentrated in the  deeper pools as summer advanced. In May and early June, large  concentrations of adult _N. umbratilis_ were common in the shallow ends  of pools together with _N. rubellus_, _N. boops_, _Pimephales notatus_,  and _Pimephales tenellus_. By July and August, only young of the year  were taken in shallow water, and adults were scarcely in evidence.      #Notropis volucellus# (Cope): Stations G-5, G-8, C-3, C-5, C-7, C-8,  C-9, C-10, M-1, E-4, E-5.    The mimic shiner was a minor element in the fauna, 2.02 per cent at  station C-5 being the largest percentage taken. In the Big Caney River  system _N. volucellus_ was taken only in the main stream. In the Grouse  Creek drainage it was found at two stations in the upper part of the  watershed, where water is clearer, gradient greater, and pools  well-shaded and cool.    In the Elk River the mimic shiner was taken only in the upper part of  the main stream. The dominant shiner in situations where _N. volucellus_  was taken was, in all cases, _N. umbratilis_. Elliott (1947) found _N.  volucellus_ in Spring Creek, a tributary of Fall River. Farther north in  the Flint Hills region, _N. volucellus_ was reported by Cross  (1954a:310).      #Notemigonus crysoleucas# (Mitchell): Station W-5.    This isolated record for the golden shiner consisted of nine specimens  collected on June 6 in Timber Creek, a tributary of the Walnut River.  Most of the creek was dry. _N. crysoleucas_ was taken in one pool with  dimensions of 8 feet by 4 feet with an average depth of 4 inches. This  creek is sluggish and silt-laden, even under conditions of favorable  precipitation. Hubbs and Ortenburger (1929b:89) observed that the golden  shiner prefers sluggish water. Hall (1952:58) took the golden shiner  only in the lowland tributaries west of Grand River and not east of the  river in upland tributaries.      #Phenacobius mirabilis# Girard: Stations W-3, C-3.    In no case was the suckermouth minnow common; it never comprised more  than 1 per cent of the fish population.      #Pimephales notatus# (Rafinesque): Stations W-4, G-5, G-7, G-9, G-12,  G-13, B-3, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11,  C-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16, C-17, C-18, M-1, M-2, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-5,  E-7 (J&J, C-131, C-132, C-133).    This was much the most abundant of the four species of _Pimephales_ in  this area. It was taken at 33 stations as compared with 10 for _P.  tenellus_, 8 for _P. promelas_, and 3 for _P. vigilax_.    The bluntnose minnow was taken almost everywhere except in the main  stream of the Arkansas and Walnut rivers and in lower Grouse Creek. _P.  notatus_ seemed to prefer clearer streams of the Flint Hills part of my  area. There was a marked increase in percentages taken in the upland  tributaries of both Caney River and Grouse Creek. In the Elk River, too,  higher concentrations were found upstream.    The highest relative numbers of bluntnose minnows were taken at station  G-12 on Crab Creek, station C-12 on Cedar Creek and station C-16 on  Spring Creek. At G-12, this minnow was abundant in the deeper isolated  pools. Males in breeding condition were taken on June 9. In Cedar Creek  the population of bluntnose minnows was observed periodically in one  pool in which they were dominant. This pool was 100 feet by 50 feet,  shallow, and with bedrock bottom. At its upper end, however, there was a  small area of heavily-shaded deeper water. Throughout the spring  bluntnose minnows were found in large schools in the shallow area. As  the summer progressed they were no longer there, but seining revealed  their presence in the deeper, upper end.    At station C-16 on Spring Creek on July 9 male _P. notatus_ were taken  in extreme breeding condition, being light brick-red in color and with  large tubercles.      #Pimephales tenellus# (Girard): Stations G-1, C-2, C-3, C-5, C-6, C-7,  C-8, M-1, E-2, E-4 (C-131 C-133).    The mountain minnow was never taken far from the mainstream of Big  Caney, Middle Caney, or Elk River. In this respect it differed from _P.  notatus_, which reached large concentrations in the small upland  tributaries. On the other hand, _P. tenellus_ was not so abundant as _P.  vigilax_ in the silty larger streams. In no collection was the mountain  minnow common. The highest percentages were 2.4 per cent (Station C-5),  and 2.1 per cent (Station C-7) on Big Caney River. These stations  consisted of clear, flowing water over rubble bottoms. Males at C-7  (June 16) were in breeding condition.    Moore and Buck (1953:23) reported finding this species among rocks in  very fast water rather than in the quiet backwaters frequented by _P.  vigilax_. Other records of the mountain minnow from the Flint Hills  indicate that it seeks areas of maximum gradient and flow; in this  distributional respect it is like _Notropis camurus_. The two species  are recorded together from other streams in this region such as the  Chikaskia (Moore and Buck, 1953:23), Cottonwood (Cross, 1954a:310), and  Spring Creek, tributary of Fall River (Elliott, 1947). It is conceivable  that a preference for flowing water might explain its restriction to  the medium-sized, less intermittent streams in this area. The only  tributary which the species seemed to ascend to any extent was Otter  Creek, which is seldom intermittent downstream.      #Pimephales vigilax perspicuus# (Girard): Stations A-3, C-1, C-4.    The parrot minnow was found only in downstream habitats. Collection C-4  (June 3) on Rock Creek was made about 1/2 mile from the mouth of this  tributary of Big Caney and the creek here had almost the same character  as the river proper. The presence of other channel fishes such as  _Ictiobus bubalus_ indicates the downstream nature of the creek. Some  males of _P. vigilax_ in breeding condition were taken in this  collection.    At C-1, only one specimen was found in a turbid, isolated pool with  bedrock bottom. At A-1 only one parrot minnow was taken; it was in deep,  fairly quiet water near the bank.    Other collections outside the three-county area revealed the following:  In the Neosho River, several parrot minnows were found in quiet  backwaters and in shallow pools. In the Verdigris River three were taken  directly under water spilling over the dam at this station, while others  were found, together with _P. promelas_, in the mouth of a small creek  that provided a backwater habitat with mud bottom.    Cross and Moore (1952:405) found this species only at stations in the  lower portion of the Poteau River. Farther west the minnow may ascend  the smaller sandy streams to greater distances. Moore and Buck (1953:23)  took parrot minnows at six of 15 stations on the Chikaskia River and  found the species as far upstream as Drury, Kansas. Elliott (1947), in  comparing the South Ninnescah and Spring Creek fish faunas, found only  _P. vigilax_ and _P. promelas_ on the sandy, \"flatter\" Ninnescah and  only _P. notatus_ and _P. tenellus_ on Spring Creek, an upland, Flint  Hills stream in Greenwood County.      #Pimephales promelas# Rafinesque: Stations A-2, A-3, W-3, W-4, G-9, B-1,  M-1, E-4 (E&F, C-136).    Occurrences of the fathead minnow were scattered, but included all  streams sampled except Big Caney.    Three of the collections were in small intermittent streams where  conditions were generally unfavorable for fishes and in one instance  extremely"]]]
