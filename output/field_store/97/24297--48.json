At length a Moses came, who knew his God, and would fain have led  mankind to know Him too, and see Him face to face. But they could not  receive His heavenly laws, or bide His presence.    Thus the holy man was forced again to veil the past in mystery, and,  in the beginning of his history, assign to man an earthly origin.    Man, moulded from the earth, as a brick!    A Woman, manufactured from a rib!    Thus, parents still would fain conceal from budding manhood, the  mysteries of procreation, or the sources of life's ever flowing river,  by relating some childish tale of new born life, engendered in the  hollow trunk of some old tree, or springing with spontaneous growth,  like mushrooms, from out the heaps of rubbish. O man! When wilt thou  cease to be a child in knowledge?    Man, as we have said, is the offspring of Deity. The entire mystery of  the past and future, with regard to his existence, is not yet solved  by mortals.    We first recognise him, as an organized individual or intelligence,  dwelling with his Father in the eternal mansions. This organized  spirit we call a body, because, although composed of the spiritual  elements, it possesses every organ after the pattern, and in the  likeness or similitude of the outward or fleshly tabernacle it is  destined eventually to inhabit. Its organs of thought, speech, sight,  hearing, tasting, smelling, feeling, &c., all exist in their order, as  in the physical body; the one being the exact similitude of the other.    This individual, spiritual body, was begotten by the heavenly Father,  in His own likeness and image, and by the laws of procreation.    It was born and matured in the heavenly mansions, trained in the  school of love in the family circle, and amid the most tender embraces  of parental and fraternal affection.    In this primeval probation, in its heavenly home, it lived and moved  as a free and rational intelligence, acting upon its own agency, and,  like all intelligence, independent in its own sphere. It was placed  under certain laws, and was responsible to its great Patriarchal Head.    This has been called a \"First Estate.\" And it is intimated that, of  the spirits thus placed upon their agency, one-third failed to keep  their first estate, and were thrust down, and reserved in chains of  darkness, for future judgment. As these are not permitted to multiply  their species, or to move forward in the scale of progressive being,  while in this state of bondage and condemnation, we will trace them no  further, as their final destiny is not revealed to mortals.    The spirits which kept their first estate, were permitted to descend  below, and to obtain a tabernacle of flesh in the rudimental existence  in which we find them in our present world, and which we will call a  second estate.    In passing the veil which separates between the first and second  estates, man becomes unconscious, and, on awakening in his second  estate, a veil is wisely thrown over all the past.    In his mortal tabernacle he remembers not the scenes, the endearing  associations, of his first, primeval childhood in the heavenly  mansions. He therefore commences anew in the lessons of experience, in  order to start on a level with the new born tabernacle, and to  re-develope his intellectual faculties in a progressive series, which  keep pace with the development of the organs and faculties of the  outward tabernacle.    During his progress in the flesh, the Holy Spirit may gradually awaken  his faculties; and in a dream, or vision, or by the spirit of  prophecy, reveal, or rather awaken the memory to, a partial vision, or  to a dim and half defined recollection of the intelligence of the  past. He sees in part, and he knows in part; but never while  tabernacled in mortal flesh will he fully awake to the intelligence of  his former estate. It surpasses his comprehension, is unspeakable, and  even unlawful to be uttered.    Having kept his second estate, and filled the measure of his  responsibilities in the flesh, he passes the veil of death, and enters  a third estate, or probationary sphere. This is called the world of  spirits, and will be treated on more fully under its appropriate head.    Filling the measure of his responsibilities in the world of spirits,  he passes, by means of the resurrection of the body, into his fourth  estate, or sphere of human existence. In this sphere he finds himself  clothed upon with an eternal body of flesh and bones, with every  sense, and every organ, restored and adapted to their proper use.    He is thus prepared with organs and faculties adapted to the  possession and enjoyment of every element of the physical or spiritual  worlds, which can gratify the senses, or conduce to the happiness of  intelligences. He associates, converses, loves, thinks, acts, moves,  sees, hears, tastes, smells, eats, drinks and possesses.    In short, all the elements necessary to his happiness being purified,  exalted, and adapted to the sphere in which he exists, are placed  within his lawful reach, and made subservient to his use.          CHAPTER VII.    DESTINY OF THE UNIVERSE.          The mystic future, with its depths profound,      For ages counted as forbidden ground,      Now lifts its veil, that man may penetrate      The secret springs, the mysteries of fate;      Know whence he is, and whither he is bound,      And why the spheres perform their ample round.    The Grand Council having developed the vast structure of the heavens  and the earth, with all their fulness, with the evident design of  utility and adaptation to certain definite uses, it well becomes us to  watch their progress, and to study with diligence their future and  final destiny.    From a general traditional belief in an immaterial hereafter, many  have concluded that the earth and all material things would be  annihilated as mere temporary structures; that the material body, and  the planets it occupies, make no part of eternal life and being; in  short, that God, angels, and men, become at last so lost, dissolved,  or merged in spirituality, or immateriality, as to lose all adaptation  to the uses of the physical elements; that they will absolutely need  no footstool, habitation, possession, mansion, home, furniture, food,  or clothing; that the whole vast works and beautiful designs of the  visible creation are a kind of necessary evil or clog on the spiritual  life, and are of no possible use except to serve for the time being,  for the home and sustenance of beings in their grosser, or rudimental  state.    What a doleful picture! With what gloom and melancholy must  intelligences contemplate the vast structure, as viewed in this light!    What a vastness of design!    What a display of wisdom!    What a field of labour in execution, do the works of creation present  to the contemplative mind!    Yet all this wisdom of design, all this labour of execution, after  serving a momentary purpose, to be thrown away as an incumbrance to  real existence and happiness.    All these \"spiritual,\" \"immaterial\" vagaries have no foundation in  truth.    The earth and other systems are to undergo a variety of changes, in  their progress towards perfection. Water, fire, and other elements are  the agents of these changes. But it is an eternal, unchangeable fact,  a fixed law of nature, easily demonstrated and illustrated by chemical  experiment, that neither fire nor any other element can annihilate a  particle of matter, to say nothing of a whole globe.    _A new heaven and a new earth_ are promised by the sacred writers. Or,  in other words, the planetary systems are to be changed, purified,  refined, exalted and glorified, in the similitude of the resurrection,  by which means all physical evil or imperfection will be done away.    In their present state they are adapted to the rudimental state of  man. They are, as it were, the nurseries for man's physical embryo  formation. Their elements afford the means of nourishing and  sustaining the tabernacle, and of engendering and strengthening the  organ of thought and mind, wherein are conceived and generated  thoughts and affections which can only be matured and consummated in a  higher sphere--thoughts pregnant with eternal life and love.    As the mind enlarges, the aspirations of an eternal being, once  ennobled and honoured in the councils of heaven, among the sons of  God, reach forth too high, and broad, and deep, to be longer adapted  to the narrow sphere of mortal life. His body is imprisoned, chained  to the earth, while his mind would soar aloft, and grasp the  intelligence, wisdom and riches of the boundless infinite.    His rudimental body must therefore pass away, and be changed, so as to  be adapted to a wider and more glorious sphere of locomotion,  research, action and enjoyment.    When the planet on which he dwells has conceived, brought forth, and  nourished the number of tabernacles assigned to it in its rudimental  state, by infinite wisdom, it must needs be acted upon by a chemical  process. The purifying elements; for instance, fire, must needs be  employed to bring it through an ordeal, a refinement, a purification,  a change commensurate with that which had before taken place in the  physical tabernacle of its inhabitants. Thus renovated, it is adapted  to resurrected man.    When man, and the planet on which he lives, with all its fulness,  shall have completed all their series of progressive changes, so as to  be adapted to the highest glories of which their several characters  and species are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35490"],[0,"Seaside Studies in Natural History.

The Ctenophorae differ from other Jelly-fishes in their mode of  locomotion. All the Discophorous Medusae, as well as Hydroids, move by  a rhythmical rise and fall of the disk, contracting and expanding with  alternations so regular, that it reminds one of the action of the  lungs, and seems at first sight to be a kind of respiration in which  water takes the place of air. The Greeks recognized this peculiar  character in their name, for they called them Sea-lungs. Indeed,  locomotion, respiration, and circulation are so intimately connected  in all these lower animals, that whatever promotes one of these  functions affects the other also, and though the immediate result of  the contraction and expansion of the disk seems to be to impel them  through the water, yet it is also connected with the introduction of  water into the body, which there becomes assimilated with the food in  the process of digestion, and is circulated throughout all its parts  by means of ramifying tubes. In the Ctenophorae there is no such  regular expansion and contraction of the disk; they are at once  distinguished from the Discophorae by the presence of external  locomotive appendages of a very peculiar character. They move by the  rapid flapping of countless little oars or paddles, arranged in  vertical rows along the surface of the disk, acting independently of  each other; one row, or even one paddle, moving singly, or all of them  together, at the will of the animal; thus enabling it to accelerate or  slacken its movements, to dart through the water rapidly, or to  diminish its speed by partly furling its little sails, or, spreading  them slightly, to poise itself with a faint, quivering movement that  reminds one of the pause of the humming-bird in the air,--something  that is neither positive motion, nor actual rest.[3]        [Footnote 3: The flappers of one side are sometimes in full      activity, while those of the other side are perfectly quiet or      nearly so, thus producing rotatory movements in every direction.]    These locomotive appendages are intimately connected with the  circulating tubes, as we shall see when we examine the structural  details of these animals, so that in them also breathing and moving  are in direct relation to each other. To those unaccustomed to the  comparison of functions in animals, the use of the word breathing, as  applied to the introduction of water into the body, may seem  inappropriate, but it is by the absorption of aerated water that these  lower animals receive that amount of oxygen into the system, as  necessary to the maintenance of life in them, as a greater supply is  to the higher animals. The name of Ctenophorae or comb-bearers, is  derived from these rows of tiny paddles which have been called combs  by some naturalists, because they are set upon horizontal bands of  muscles, see Fig. 29, reminding one of the base of a comb, while the  fringes are compared to its teeth. These flappers add greatly to the  beauty of these animals, for a variety of brilliant hues is produced  along each row by the decomposition of the rays of light upon them  when in motion. They give off all the prismatic colors, and as the  combs are exceedingly small, so that at first sight one hardly  distinguishes them from the disk itself, the exquisite play of color,  rippling in regular lines over the surface of the animal, seems at  first to have no external cause.      _Pleurobrachia_. (_Pleurobrachia rhododactyla Ag_.)        [Illustration: Fig. 27. Pleurobrachia seen at right angles to the      plane in which the tentacles are placed. (_Agassiz_.)]    Among the most graceful and attractive of these animals are the  Pleurobrachia (Fig. 29), and, though not first in order, we will give  it the precedence in our description, because it will serve to  illustrate some features of the other two groups. The body of the  Pleurobrachia consists of a transparent sphere, varying, however, from  the perfect sphere in being somewhat oblong, and also by a slight  compression on two opposite sides (Figs. 27 and 28), so as to render  its horizontal diameter longer in one direction than in the other  (Fig. 30). This divergence from the globular form, so slight in  Pleurobrachia as to be hardly perceptible to the casual observer,  establishing two diameters of different lengths at right angles with  each other, is equally true of the other genera. It is interesting and  important, as showing the tendency in this highest group of Acalephs  to assume a bilateral character. This bilaterality becomes still more  marked in the highest class of Radiates, the Echinoderms. Such  structural tendencies in the lower animals, hinting at laws to be more  fully developed in the higher forms, are always significant, as  showing the intimate relation between all parts of the plan of  creation. This inequality of the diameters is connected with the  disposition of parts in the whole structure, the locomotive fringes  and the vertical tubes connected with them being arranged in sets of  four on either side of a plane passing through the longer diameter,  showing thus a tendency toward the establishment of a right and left  side of the body, instead of the perfectly equal disposition of parts  around a common centre, as in the lower Radiates.        [Illustration: Fig. 28. Pleurobrachia seen in plane of tentacles.      (_Agassiz_.)]    The Pleurobrachia are so transparent, that, with some preparatory  explanation of their structure, the most unscientific observer may  trace the relation of parts in them. At one end of the sphere is the  transverse split (Fig. 27), that serves them as a mouth; at the  opposite pole is a small circumscribed area, in the centre of which is  a dark eye-speck. The eight rows of locomotive fringes run from pole  to pole, dividing the whole surface of the body like the ribs on a  melon. (Figs. 27, 28.) Hanging from either side of the body, a little  above the area in which the eye-speck is placed, are two most  extraordinary appendages in the shape of long tentacles, possessing  such wonderful power of extension and contraction that, while at one  moment they may be knotted into a little compact mass no bigger than a  pin's head, drawn up close against the side of the body, or hidden  within it, the next instant they may be floating behind it in various  positions to a distance of half a yard and more, putting out at the  same time soft plumy fringes (Fig. 29) along one side, like the beard  of a feather. One who has never seen these animals may well be  pardoned for doubting even the most literal and matter-of-fact account  of these singular tentacles. There is no variety of curve or spiral  that does not seem to be represented in their evolutions. Sometimes  they unfold gradually, creeping out softly and slowly from a state of  contraction, or again the little ball, hardly perceptible against the  side of the body, drops suddenly to the bottom of the tank in which  the animal floating, and one thinks for a moment, so slight is the  thread-like attachment, that it has actually fallen from the body; but  watch a little longer, and all the filaments spread out along the side  of the thread, it expands to its full length and breadth, and resumes  all its graceful evolutions.        [Illustration: Fig. 29. Natural attitude of Pleurobrachia when in      motion.]        [Illustration: Fig. 30. Pleurobrachia seen from the extremity      opposite the mouth.]    One word of the internal structure of these animals, to explain its  relation to the external appendages. The mouth opens into a wide  digestive cavity (Figs. 27, 28), enclosed between two vertical tubes.  Toward the opposite end of the body these tubes terminate or unite in  a single funnel-like canal, which is a reservoir as it were for the  circulating fluid poured into it through an opening in the bottom of  the digestive cavity. The food in the digestive cavity becomes  liquefied by mingling with the water entering with it at the mouth,  and, thus prepared, it passes into this canal, from which, as we shall  presently see, all the circulating tubes ramifying throughout the body  are fed. Two of these circulating tubes, or, as they are called from  the nature of the liquid they contain, chymiferous tubes, are very  large, starting horizontally and at right angles with the digestive  cavity from the point of junction between the vertical tubes (Fig. 30)  and the canal. Presently they give off two branches, those again  ramifying in two directions as they approach the periphery, so that  each one of the first main tubes has multiplied to four, before its  ramifications reach the surface, thus making in all eight radiating  tubes. So far, these eight tubes are horizontal, all diverging on the  same level; but as they reach the periphery each one gives rise to a  vertical tube, running along the surface of the body from pole to  pole, just within the rows of locomotive fringes on the outer surface,  and immediately connected with them (Figs. 27, 28). As in all the  Ctenophorae, these fringes keep up a constant play of color by their  rapid vibrations. In Pleurobrachia the prevailing tint is a yellowish  pink, though it varies to green, red, and purple, with the changing  motions of the animal. We have seen that the vertical tubes between  which the digestive cavity is enclosed, start like the cavity itself  from that pole of the body where the mouth is placed, and that, as  they approach the opposite pole, at a distance from the mouth of about  two thirds the whole length of the body, they unite in the canal,  which then extends to the other pole where the eye-"]]]
