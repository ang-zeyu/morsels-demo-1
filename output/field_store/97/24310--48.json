This it is, in a few words, that the American requires. And       now, I ask--how many old and young teachers are there in       Germany thus qualified?         \"I here speak, of course, in a general way; for I well know       that there are in Germany many teachers and learned men, who       could more than fulfil all of these requirements of the       American parent, but their number is unfortunately limited;       and I deem it important that I speak freely and fully on       this subject, since many a learned German, whose       acquirements and scientific knowledge would insure him an       independent and respectable station at home, nevertheless       frequently finds himself compelled by the pressure of       circumstances to seek America, in the hope of there opening       a school, or at least finding employment as teacher, and       there too frequently, in addition to the bitterest       disappointment, discovers too late that he is fit for no       other practical employment which will yield him his daily       bread.         \"As a proof, however, that most of these so called       pedagogues must in America be necessarily deceived in their       expectations, I take the liberty of adding yet a few words.         \"The American requires before all, as far as the moral       qualifications of the teacher are concerned, a firm       religious tendency--a requirement for which the scion of       'Young Germany,' fresh from his university career, has but       little taste; since his recollections of that life are yet       too fresh upon him to admit of a willing submission to such       rules,--and I advise any one who proposes to follow such a       course to become a farmer's man, rather than a hypocrite or       sham-saint....         \"If we proceed in our examination of private schools in       America, we find that the majority are for the education of       girls. Upon which the question arises--Are German ladies       generally adapted to the superintendence of such       establishments?--a question which I must either answer with       No, or modify with the admission that if there be any       schools managed by German ladies, I am ignorant of their       existence. The cause for the negative being essentially the       same as with the male scholars.         \"No man can better appreciate the worth of German women than       myself. I acknowledge perfectly their virtues and       excellencies--their domestic sphere is their world,       inhabited by their children and ruled by their husbands,       whose faithful, true-hearted, modest, obedient companions       they are. To be independent and free is not in their nature;       they are not so adapted either by origin or manner of life;       nor does their education embrace any thing cosmopolitan.       Born and brought up in a province, or court city, they have       never cast a glance beyond its limits or boundaries, or       those of the nearest town, and all that lies beyond is to       them unknown and uninteresting. Thus they generally lead,       according to ancient custom, (_nach altem brauch_) an       almost vegetable life; and nothing save the dictates of       fashion can ever disturb in the slightest degree the       equanimity of their quiet souls. They do not in the least       interest themselves in the progress of industry, literature,       science, or politics, even in Germany--much less for that of       foreign countries; but are content with learning in which       section of the place they inhabit this or that necessary       article may be best or most cheaply purchased; what late       foreign romance is current in the circulating library; and       what are the latest changes in bonnets, caps, chemisettes,       or dresses, in the kingdom of fashion--whose sovereign they       all obey. In politics they rest under the perpetual       conviction that all goes on in the old way, and pass their       leisure hours in coteries and parties, where knittings       exclude all _spirituelle_ entertainment. In the lower grades       of the middle class, they grow up with an unchangeable       feeling of social inferiority, and shudder at every free       glance into life, as if guilty of unheard of arrogance and       presumption.         \"And how is it possible that a woman who has grown up in       such social relations should, despite the fullest possession       of all imaginable virtues and acquirements, be capable of       teaching high-minded and independent girls? The American       maiden regards most household employments as work requiring       but little intelligence, and for which even negroes are as       well qualified. She believes that she can better occupy the       time necessary to the acquisition of subordinate       acquirements, and prefers reading, music, and art, to       knitting stockings, and similar soul-killing business. She       recognizes, moreover, no distinction in rank, but strives to       acquire as many accomplishments and as refined manners as       any other person. In short, she strives to become _a lady_,       and regards it as no extraordinary assumption, particularly       when education or natural advantages adapt her thereto, to       consider herself quite as good as any other woman in the       republic. Nor does she forget that the time will come when,       as mother, the first development of her child's mind will       become a duty, and she remembers also that he will be a       republican whose sphere of action is without limit, if his       ability correspond only to the effort. Moreover, the       American maidens are materially very _wide awake_, (_sehr       auf gewecht_,) particularly in the large cities, where they       enjoy excellent opportunities for instruction, and are       proportionally highly educated.         \"The American woman or girl highly esteems the _elegant_ and       _noble_, striving ever to form herself after this pattern,       on which account French female teachers are universally       preferred, even when very imperfectly qualified. The       revolutions in France have driven forth many well educated       persons to America, who have been compelled to seek by       teaching a livelihood. Louis Philippe himself was once among       the number. In addition to the fact that no nation surpasses       the French in personal accomplishments, they have for       Americans the further recommendation that their nation has       played an important part in modern history. The American is       impressed in favor of France, because she aided him in       freeing his country from the yoke of England; and this       inclination manifests itself continually in language.         \"And when the American boy glances over his school-books, he       sees France represented in pictures as the _polite_ nation,       and reads in history that she aided his country in the war       of freedom, and that Lafayette was the _friend_ of       Washington; while the same work represents the German as a       merely agricultural race, portrayed in the caricature of an       Altenburger peasant and his wife, in their fantastic       national dress. From the same book he also learns that a       German prince sold his subjects for so many pounds per head       to aid England to subdue his country. Such contrasts cannot       but awake in the child's mind deeply-rooted prejudices, far       from favorable to the German race.         \"And since there has been for years an emigration to America       of Germans who were very generally poor and       uneducated--people speaking a revolting dialect, employed in       the lowest offices, and not unfrequently much resembling the       pictures in the geographies, the prejudice formed in early       youth has been thus strengthened, that the Germans are a       rough, uncultivated race, industrious and domestic, it is       true, but yet very little improved by civilization--of all       which the native Pennsylvania Germans afford unfortunately       striking examples. The well-educated American, of course,       knows better how to appreciate the true value of the       Germans; he is aware of the value of their contributions to       literature, science, art, and music; only in politics, and       in the practical application of knowledge, he places (and       not without justice) but little confidence in them.         \"But the personal appearance and bearing of many Germans,       who are in themselves truly worthy of respect, often induce       the well-educated and refined American to place in the back       ground their otherwise estimable qualities. There is often       something rough and harsh about the German, and his domestic       habits are not invariably in unison with his erudition and       excellent education, but frequently destroy the good       impression which the latter might produce; moreover, their       '_geselliges Leben_,' (social jovial life) as Germans term       it, with its accompaniments of pipe and mug, are in the       highest degree revolting to an American. And further, it is       taken ill of the German that he considers that regard for       the sex, entertained by the American, as carried somewhat       too far, and allows himself to form on this point a too       hasty, and not seldom unfavorable judgment, without seeking       to examine more accurately this domestic characteristic."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36496"],[0,"On the cattle plague: or, Contagious typhus in horned cattle. Its history, (#8)"],[1,"animals all died. Yet he quotes the encouraging results obtained by  Camper in Holland, who, out of 112 inoculated cattle, saved 41; and  those of Koopman, who, out of 94, cured 45 by this very inoculation.    He reminds us that the cattle typhus is an abiding disease in Hungary  and Russia, where the beasts having bad water to drink, can only be  protected by a constant use of marine salt (_sel gemme_); but being  deprived of this salt, when they go great distances to be sold, and  being exposed to extreme fatigue and privations, the typhus then spreads  among them. He likewise tells us that Hungary and Dalmatia, which used  to supply the markets of Italy with butcher's meat, were obliged to give  up sending any cattle there, the Italians having firmly refused to  purchase the same at any price whatever.    As regards treatment, the advice which Vicq d'Azyr gives to  agriculturists, is mostly borrowed from the authors who have written on  the great epizootics of 1711, and 1745 to 1755. Thus, he advises them to  give as drinks in the first stage, water whitened with meal and nitred;  to purge the animals with linseed oil; even to make scarifications on  the skin, and to keep up the suppuration with turpentine; to make the  animals inhale six times a day vapours seasoned with vinegar; to wrap  them over with woollen cloths; to bleed them once or twice; to  administer to them, when diarrhoea shows itself, a beverage containing  wormwood, quinine, and diascordium; to cut open the tumours containing  pus or air, etc.    It is, as is seen, the same treatment as that quoted above; he  guarantees its success, and supports his views by the authority of Van  Swieten and Huxan.    Van Swieten, however, had somewhat modified the treatment, by the  predominance which he allowed to acids; and this course seemed to him to  be only reasonable with respect to animals whose sick humours contain an  excess of alkali.    Vicq d'Azyr fixed his attention on the means of prevention, the most  effectual of which, in his opinion, was to slaughter every animal which  had either sickened, or had been exposed to the influence of the  contagion; and as he insisted that the authorities had no measures to  keep in this matter of public interest, he made it a principle that the  government was bound to compensate the cattle proprietors whose animals  had to be killed--the more so, said he, that the crafty husbandmen would  never come forward and freely declare the invalidity of their cattle,  unless some indemnity were held out to them, which they would look upon  as a sort of equivalent for the benefits they had expected by cutting  them up and selling them as the food of man.    The doctors of the period, scenting in Vicq d'Azyr a dangerous  competitor, considered the advice of exterminating the diseased cattle  as an _ingenious means of curing_ them, and as the author's age and  experience gave warrant for this satirical tone of discussion, the  public joined them in laughing at him.    The epizootic typhus, if not so destructive, was at least as frequent in  the early part of the nineteenth century, as it had been during the  eighteenth. The armies during the wars of united Europe against the  French Republic and Empire, found it constantly in their train. Nor  could it be otherwise, the two leading causes of its prevalence being at  hand. For on one hand there was the transit of large herds from the  steppes of Hungary, and on the other the wretched hygienic conditions  amidst which the cattle had to live in the campaigning armies.    Many books have been published of late years on the diseases of cattle,  in France and Germany; and several distinguished English veterinary  surgeons, especially Professor Simonds, have also devoted their  attention to the same subject. In the second part of this work, we shall  have occasion to refer to their labours.    In France, Renault, Delafond, d'Arboval, Gelle, whose works enjoy a  deserved reputation, have discussed the subject of the origin of this  disease.    Renault asserts that the disease has but one single focus, the steppes  of Russia and Hungary. The epizootics of Asia, Africa, and South America  are caused, he considers, by the importation of animals to those  countries. It is thus that he explains the epizootia which, under the  name of Delombodera, devastated the American Republics in 1832, and that  which, in 1841, appeared in Egypt. Renault thinks that neither the long  transit, nor the filthy state of the markets, nor the most wretched  feeding, are sufficient to account for contagious typhus among cattle;  that in addition to these causes, it still requires, in order to produce  and generate it among animals, a predisposition, and a special aptitude,  such as, hitherto at least, do not appear to have been witnessed except  in the progeny of the steppes.    The other professors of his fraternity have submitted arguments to him,  which to us seem very rational; and we will endeavour to do justice to  them when we discuss the origin of the typhus which at this moment is  afflicting England.      VI.    These historical dissertations and speculations on the subject of the  bovine epizootia certainly deserve to draw the attention of all who feel  an interest in the malady; but how insignificant they are compared with  the concluding facts which I have still to mention, before I at length  address myself to the consideration of the epizootia which is now  consuming our herds!    The indisputable fact that so terrible a distemper as this typhus had  fixed itself permanently in Russia, and that it was causing incalculable  losses to the lordly proprietors of the steppes, as well as to the  government, roused them at last from their indifference. Then, indeed,  they urged the veterinary doctors to adopt some energetic means to  arrest the long duration of the scourge, and we must admit to their  honour, that various experiments which were tried for the purpose of  preventing the evil, have been crowned with complete success. Any one  may ascertain the fact by referring to the _Journal Magazin_ of Berlin,  in which the learned Professor Jessen of Dorpat has explained the  results of these important experiments.    The Russian veterinarians having observed that the oxen which had been  cured of the typhus could mingle with impunity with the infected herds,  conceived the idea of communicating the complaint to sound cattle by  means of inoculation, and thereby to shield them from the contagion.    The first experiments in the inoculation of _Tchouma_ or cattle typhus,  were made in the year 1853, by order of the government, in the  neighbourhood of Odessa, at the Heridin farm, by Professor Jessen.    The first inoculative attempts were very fatal; they caused the death of  all the inoculated animals. But it was soon perceived that these  grievous results, far from prejudicing the theory, really confirmed it;  and that the virus, attenuated in its toxical properties, would prove as  effectual as was expected. And truly, in 1854 and 1855, at the Dorpat  establishment, the inoculations made with a better selected virus  afforded results less disastrous. At Kozau they were still more  satisfactory. In fine, passing from experiment to experiment, they  arrived at the conclusion that it was necessary to inoculate several  heads of cattle, the one after the other, without having recourse to any  other virus than the first inoculated, so that they might thereby obtain  virus of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and up to the 10th generation. The  virus thus attenuated in its morbid effects answered at length every  experiment, and oxen thus inoculated could mingle with impunity with  diseased cattle.    At the veterinary establishment of Chalkoff they inoculated, during  eight meetings, 1059 animals with virus of the 3rd generation, and the  results were as satisfactory as could be wished for, only 60 animals  having sunk under the effects of this preventive operation.    The inoculations made in 1857 and 1858 on an estate belonging to the  Duchess Helena, at Karlowska, in the government of Pultawa, and  conducted by the veterinarian Raussels, likewise afforded the most  satisfactory results.    Professor Jessen thinks it certain, that beasts born of cows which have  been afflicted with contagious typhus do not contract the disease. He  maintains that Europe may be preserved from this frightful scourge, by  taking care that no cattle be exported from the steppes of Russia save  those which have had the distemper either naturally or by inoculation,  and he is striving to propagate this opinion, and to render it  practical, by having all the cattle inoculated, without exception.    It is deeply to be regretted that counsels so prudent have not been  heeded in the 47 governments which, out of the 53 possessed by Russia,  have generated the contagious typhus; for then it would not so  frequently have effected its passage into the neighbouring states, and  England most probably, would not now have to take up arms against its  fatal extension.      VII.    We here conclude that part of our labour which includes the history of  this disease, and what we have been able to glean from those medical  writers, and others, who have given us the results of their experience.  It may have appeared somewhat protracted, but it has at least laid open  to the student the antecedent investigations of our predecessors, under  calamities of the same kind, but considerably more fatal than what has  yet been witnessed in Western Europe during our time. We have  disinterred and brought to light the forgotten works of conscientious  and competent men. Like Brunelleschi, the architect, we have sought, not  to invent a theory, but to recover a practice; and thus we have received  the observations and precious facts, and finally the preventive  treatment, of other men and other times, which had coped successfully  against the"]]]
