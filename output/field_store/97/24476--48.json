Kumboola's sheltered aspect is thickly clad with jungle; a steep grassy  ridge springs from the blue-grey rocks to the south-east; and on the  precipitous weather side grow low and open scrub and dwarf casuarina.  Here is a natural aviary. Pigeons and doves coo; honey-eaters whistle;  sun-birds whisper quaint, quick notes; wood swallows soar and twitter.  Metallic starlings seek safe sleeping-places among the mangroves, ere  they repair last year's villages, and join excitedly in the chorus; while  the great osprey wheels overhead, and the grey falcon sits on a bare  branch, still as a sentinel, each waiting for an opportunity to take toll  of the nutmeg pigeons. The channel-billed cuckoo shrieks her discordant  warning of the approaching wet season; and the scrub fowl utters those  far-off imitations of the exclamation of civilised hens. Sundown at  Kumboola towards the end of September, when the sea laps and murmurs  among the rocks, and great white pigeons gather in thousands on the dark  foliage, or \"coo-hooing\" and flapping, disappear beneath the thick leafy  canopy, and all the other birds are saying their good-nights, or  asserting their rights, or protesting against crowding or intrusion, is  an ever-to-be-remembered experience. Added to the cheerful presence of  the noisy birds, are the pleasant odours which spring from the jungle as  coolness prevails, and the flaming west gives a weird tint of red to the  outlines of the trees, and of purple to the drowsy sea.    Of entirely different character is the last of the satellites to be  mentioned, Wooln-garin. Lying 300 yards off the south-western end of Dunk  Island, across a swift and deep channel, it is naught but a confused mass  of weather-beaten rocks, the loftiest not being more than 50 feet above  high-water. A few pandanus palms, hardy shrubs and trailers, and  mangroves, spring from sheltered crevices, but for the most part the  rocks are bare. The incessant assaults of the sea have cut deep but  narrow clefts in the granite, worn out sounding hollows, and smoothed  away angularities. Here a few terns rear their young, and succeeding  generations of the sooty oyster-catcher lay their eggs just out of the  reach of high-tide. A never-ending procession of fish passes up and down  the channel, according as the tide flows and ebbs, though they do not at  all times take serious heed of bait. To one who generally fishes for a  definite purpose, it is tantalising to peep down into the clear depths  and watch the lazy fish come and go, ignoring the presence of that which  at other times is greedily snapped at. Turtle, and occasionally dugong,  favour the vicinity of Wooln-garin which on account of its distinctive  character is one of the most frequented of the satellites.    The neighbouring islands include Timana, 2 1/2 miles from the sand-spit  of Dunk Island and 1 1/2 mile from Kumboola. Bedarra lies a little to the  southward; Tool-ghar three-quarters of a mile from Bedarra; Coomboo half  a mile from Tool-ghar; and the group of three--Bud-joo, Kurrambah and  Coolah--still further to the south-east. These comprise the Family  Islands of the chart.    On Timana are gigantic milkwood trees (ALSTONIA SCHOLARIS) which need  great flying buttresses to support their immense height, their roots  being mainly superficial. For many generations two ospreys have had their  eyrie in one of these giant trees, fit nursery for imperial birds! With  annual additions, the nest has attained immense proportions, and as years  pass it will still further increase, for blacks capable of climbing such  a tree and disturbing the occupants are few and far between. Great  distinction and pride, however, are the lot of the athlete who secures  the snowy down of the young birds to stick in tufts on his dirty head  with fat, gum or beeswax, for he will be the admired of all admirers at  the CORROBBOREE. Vanity impels human beings to extraordinary exertions,  trials and risks, and the black who desires to outshine his fellows, and  who has the essential of strength and length of limb, will make a loop of  lawyer vine round the tree, and with his body within the loop begin the  ascent. Having cut a notch for the left great toe, he inclines his weight  against the tree, while he shifts the loop three feet or so upwards. Then  he leans backward against the loop, cuts a notch for his right great toe,  and so on until the nest is reached. There has been but one ascent of  this tree in modern times, and the name of the black, \"Spider,\" is still  treasured.    A heavy, slovenly-patched mantle of leafage, impervious to sunlight,  covers the Isle of Timana, creating a region of perpetual dimness from  western beach to eastern precipice, where orchids cling and palms peer on  rocks below. All the vegetation is matted and interwoven, only the  topmost branches of the milkwood escaping from the clinging, aspiring  vines. Tradition asserts that not many years since Timana was much  favoured by nutmeg pigeons, now sparsely represented; but the varied  honey-eater and a friar bird possessing a most mellow and fluty note,  cockatoos and metallic starlings are plentiful. Although there is no  permanent fresh water, the pencil-tailed rat leaves numerous tracks on  the sand, and scrub fowls keep the whole surface perpetually raked.    From a mound adjacent to the beach a black boy brought fifteen eggs as we  picnicked on the beach, and though some of them were nigh upon hatching,  not one was covered with white ants--which, an authority asserts,  particularly like crawling over the eggshells, so as to be ready when  wanted by the chicks. Nor have I ever seen an instance of this alleged  exhibition of self-sacrifice on the part of the white ant. Another boy  had eaten his very substantial lunch, but the eggs were tempting and he  baked two. One, and that new-laid, is ample for an ordinary mortal. The  condition of the first resembled that which the embarrassed curate  described as \"good in parts\"; but \"Mickie\" was not nice over a  half-hatched egg. Indeed, was it not rather more piquant than otherwise?  The second proved to contain a fully developed chicken. Now the chick  emerges from the shell feathered, and this, but for the unfortunate  accident of discovery, would have begun to scratch for its living in a  day or so. Mickie flicked away the fragments of shell from the steaming  dainty and laid it snugly on a leaf. \"That's for Paddy\"--an Irish  terrier, always of the party. It was an affecting act of renunciation.  Presently \"Paddy\" came along; but \"Paddy,\" who, too, had lunched,  bestowed merely a sniff and a \"No, thank you\" wag of the tail. \"What, you  no want 'em? All right.\" No second offer was risked, and in a moment, in  one mouthful, the chick was being crunched by Mickie, feathers and all.  The menu of the Chinese--with its ducks' eggs salted, sharks' fins and  tails, stewed pups, fowls' and ducks' tongues, fricasseed cat, rat soup,  silkworm grubs, and odds and ends generally despised and rejected--is  pitifully unromantic when set against the generous omnivority of  Australian blacks.    A mile beyond Timana is Bedarra, with its lovely little bays and coves  and fantastically weathered rocks, its forest and jungle and scrub, and  its rocky satellite Pee-rahm-ah.    Several of the most conspicuous landmarks are associated in the minds of  blacks with legends, generally of the simplest and most prosaic nature.  About this rough rock Pee-rahm-ah is a story which in the minds of the  natives satisfactorily accounts for its presence.    In the far-away past two nice young gins, they say, were left by  themselves on Dunk Island, while the others of the tribe went away in  canoes to Hinchinbrook. Tiring of their lonesomeness, they made up their  minds to regain the company of their relatives by swimming from island to  island. Kumboola was easily reached; to Timana it is but a mile and a  half, and a mile thence to Bedarra. Leaving the most easterly point of  Bedarra, they were quickly caught in the swirl of a strong current and  spun about until both became dazed and exhausted. As they disappeared  beneath the water they were changed to stone, and the stone rose in  fantastic shape, and from that day Pee-rahm-ah has weathered all the  storms of the Pacific and formed a feature in the loveliest scene these  isles reveal.    The largest of the neighbouring isles, Bedarra, has less than a square  mile of superficial area; the smallest but 4 or 5 acres. The smaller are  made up of confused masses of granite, for the most part so overgrown  with fig trees, plumy palms, milkwoods, umbrella-trees, quandongs,  eugenias, hibiscus bushes, bananas and lawyer vines, as to be  unexplorable without a scrub-knife; for the soil among the rocks is soft  and spongy, the purest of vegetable mould, and encourages luxurious  growth. The jungle droops over the grey rocks on the sheltered side.  Twisted Moreton Bay ash and wind-crippled scrub spring up among the  clefts and crevices on the weather frontage--the south-east--while a  narrow strip of sand, the only landing-place, is a general characteristic  of the north-west aspect. Birds nest in numbers in peace and security,  for the islets are off the general track. Seldom is there any disturbance  of the primeval quietude, and in the encompassing sea, if the fish and  turtle suffer any excitement, rarely is the cause attributable to man.    The islands immediately to the south-east form the Family Group--triplets,  twins and two singles. I like to think approving things of them; to note  individual excellences; to familiarise myself with their distinguishing  traits; to listen to them in their petulance and anger, and in that  sobbing subsidence to even temper; to their complacent gurglings and  sleepy "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#8)"],[1,"of the present day, and sometimes, so far as can be  discovered, have little or no reference either to time or space. In any  case, he generally contents himself with a very slight embroidery of  outward manners,--the faintest possible counterfeit of real life,--and  endeavors to create an interest by some less obvious peculiarity of the  subject. Occasionally a breath of Nature, a raindrop of pathos and  tenderness, or a gleam of humor, will find its way into the midst of  his fantastic imagery, and make us feel as if, after all, we were yet  within the limits of our native earth. We will only add to this very  cursory notice that M. de l'Aubepine's productions, if the reader  chance to take them in precisely the proper point of view, may amuse a  leisure hour as well as those of a brighter man; if otherwise, they can  hardly fail to look excessively like nonsense.    Our author is voluminous; he continues to write and publish with as  much praiseworthy and indefatigable prolixity as if his efforts were  crowned with the brilliant success that so justly attends those of  Eugene Sue. His first appearance was by a collection of stories in a  long series of volumes entitled \"Contes deux fois racontees.\" The  titles of some of his more recent works (we quote from memory) are as  follows: \"Le Voyage Celeste a Chemin de Fer,\" 3 tom., 1838; \"Le nouveau  Pere Adam et la nouvelle Mere Eve,\" 2 tom., 1839; \"Roderic; ou le  Serpent a l'estomac,\" 2 tom., 1840; \"Le Culte du Feu,\" a folio volume  of ponderous research into the religion and ritual of the old Persian  Ghebers, published in 1841; \"La Soiree du Chateau en Espagne,\" 1 tom.,  8vo, 1842; and \"L'Artiste du Beau; ou le Papillon Mecanique,\" 5 tom.,  4to, 1843. Our somewhat wearisome perusal of this startling catalogue  of volumes has left behind it a certain personal affection and  sympathy, though by no means admiration, for M. de l'Aubepine; and we  would fain do the little in our power towards introducing him favorably  to the American public. The ensuing tale is a translation of his  \"Beatrice; ou la Belle Empoisonneuse,\" recently published in \"La Revue  Anti-Aristocratique.\" This journal, edited by the Comte de Bearhaven,  has for some years past led the defence of liberal principles and  popular rights with a faithfulness and ability worthy of all praise.      A young man, named Giovanni Guasconti, came, very long ago, from the  more southern region of Italy, to pursue his studies at the University  of Padua. Giovanni, who had but a scanty supply of gold ducats in his  pocket, took lodgings in a high and gloomy chamber of an old edifice  which looked not unworthy to have been the palace of a Paduan noble,  and which, in fact, exhibited over its entrance the armorial bearings  of a family long since extinct. The young stranger, who was not  unstudied in the great poem of his country, recollected that one of the  ancestors of this family, and perhaps an occupant of this very mansion,  had been pictured by Dante as a partaker of the immortal agonies of his  Inferno. These reminiscences and associations, together with the  tendency to heartbreak natural to a young man for the first time out of  his native sphere, caused Giovanni to sigh heavily as he looked around  the desolate and ill-furnished apartment.    \"Holy Virgin, signor!\" cried old Dame Lisabetta, who, won by the  youth's remarkable beauty of person, was kindly endeavoring to give the  chamber a habitable air, \"what a sigh was that to come out of a young  man's heart! Do you find this old mansion gloomy? For the love of  Heaven, then, put your head out of the window, and you will see as  bright sunshine as you have left in Naples.\"    Guasconti mechanically did as the old woman advised, but could not  quite agree with her that the Paduan sunshine was as cheerful as that  of southern Italy. Such as it was, however, it fell upon a garden  beneath the window and expended its fostering influences on a variety  of plants, which seemed to have been cultivated with exceeding care.    \"Does this garden belong to the house?\" asked Giovanni.    \"Heaven forbid, signor, unless it were fruitful of better pot herbs  than any that grow there now,\" answered old Lisabetta. \"No; that garden  is cultivated by the own hands of Signor Giacomo Rappaccini, the famous  doctor, who, I warrant him, has been heard of as far as Naples. It is  said that he distils these plants into medicines that are as potent as  a charm. Oftentimes you may see the signor doctor at work, and  perchance the signora, his daughter, too, gathering the strange flowers  that grow in the garden.\"    The old woman had now done what she could for the aspect of the  chamber; and, commending the young man to the protection of the saints,  took her departure.    Giovanni still found no better occupation than to look down into the  garden beneath his window. From its appearance, he judged it to be one  of those botanic gardens which were of earlier date in Padua than  elsewhere in Italy or in the world. Or, not improbably, it might once  have been the pleasure-place of an opulent family; for there was the  ruin of a marble fountain in the centre, sculptured with rare art, but  so wofully shattered that it was impossible to trace the original  design from the chaos of remaining fragments. The water, however,  continued to gush and sparkle into the sunbeams as cheerfully as ever.  A little gurgling sound ascended to the young man's window, and made  him feel as if the fountain were an immortal spirit that sung its song  unceasingly and without heeding the vicissitudes around it, while one  century imbodied it in marble and another scattered the perishable  garniture on the soil. All about the pool into which the water subsided  grew various plants, that seemed to require a plentiful supply of  moisture for the nourishment of gigantic leaves, and in some instances,  flowers gorgeously magnificent. There was one shrub in particular, set  in a marble vase in the midst of the pool, that bore a profusion of  purple blossoms, each of which had the lustre and richness of a gem;  and the whole together made a show so resplendent that it seemed enough  to illuminate the garden, even had there been no sunshine. Every  portion of the soil was peopled with plants and herbs, which, if less  beautiful, still bore tokens of assiduous care, as if all had their  individual virtues, known to the scientific mind that fostered them.  Some were placed in urns, rich with old carving, and others in common  garden pots; some crept serpent-like along the ground or climbed on  high, using whatever means of ascent was offered them. One plant had  wreathed itself round a statue of Vertumnus, which was thus quite  veiled and shrouded in a drapery of hanging foliage, so happily  arranged that it might have served a sculptor for a study.    While Giovanni stood at the window he heard a rustling behind a screen  of leaves, and became aware that a person was at work in the garden.  His figure soon emerged into view, and showed itself to be that of no  common laborer, but a tall, emaciated, sallow, and sickly-looking man,  dressed in a scholar's garb of black. He was beyond the middle term of  life, with gray hair, a thin, gray beard, and a face singularly marked  with intellect and cultivation, but which could never, even in his more  youthful days, have expressed much warmth of heart.    Nothing could exceed the intentness with which this scientific gardener  examined every shrub which grew in his path: it seemed as if he was  looking into their inmost nature, making observations in regard to  their creative essence, and discovering why one leaf grew in this shape  and another in that, and wherefore such and such flowers differed among  themselves in hue and perfume. Nevertheless, in spite of this deep  intelligence on his part, there was no approach to intimacy between  himself and these vegetable existences. On the contrary, he avoided  their actual touch or the direct inhaling of their odors with a caution  that impressed Giovanni most disagreeably; for the man's demeanor was  that of one walking among malignant influences, such as savage beasts,  or deadly snakes, or evil spirits, which, should he allow them one  moment of license, would wreak upon him some terrible fatality. It was  strangely frightful to the young man's imagination to see this air of  insecurity in a person cultivating a garden, that most simple and  innocent of human toils, and which had been alike the joy and labor of  the unfallen parents of the race. Was this garden, then, the Eden of  the present world? And this man, with such a perception of harm in what  his own hands caused to grow,--was he the Adam?    The distrustful gardener, while plucking away the dead leaves or  pruning the too luxuriant growth of the shrubs, defended his hands with  a pair of thick gloves. Nor were these his only armor. When, in his  walk through the garden, he came to the magnificent plant that hung its  purple gems beside the marble fountain, he placed a kind of mask over  his mouth and nostrils, as if all this beauty did but conceal a  deadlier malice; but, finding his task still too dangerous, he drew  back, removed the mask, and called loudly, but in the infirm voice of a  person affected with inward disease, \"Beatrice!  Beatrice!\"    \"Here am I, my father. What would you?\" cried a rich and youthful voice  from the window of the opposite house--a voice as rich as a tropical  sunset, and which made Giovanni, though he knew not why, think of deep  hues of purple or crimson and of perfumes heavily delectable. \"Are you  in the garden?\"    \"Yes, Beatrice,\" answered the gardener, \"and I need your help.\"    Soon there emerged from under a sculptured portal the figure of a young  girl, arrayed with as much richness of taste as the most splendid of  the flowers, beautiful as the day, and with a bloom so deep and vivid  that one shade more "]]]
