Ever bear in mind that you are a soldier of the Cross. Avoid  luxury, live simply and modestly; be not led away by others, upon whom  their vows may sit but lightly; keep ever in your mind that you have  joined the Order neither to gain fame nor personal advantage, but simply  that you may devote the strength and the intelligence that God has given  you to protect Christendom from the advance of the infidel. I shall  hear of you from time to time from D'Aubusson, and feel sure that the  expectations I have formed of you will be fulfilled.\"        CHAPTER III THE GRAND MASTER'S PAGE      The grand prior had, in accordance with Dame Tresham's request, sent the  steward of the house to one of the principal jewellers of the city who,  as the Order were excellent customers, paid a good price for her jewels.  After the payment for the numerous dresses required for the service as  a page to the grand master, the grand prior handed the balance of the  money Dame Tresham had brought with her, and that obtained by the sale  of her jewels, to one of the knights under whose charge Gervaise was to  travel, to be given by him to D'Aubusson for the necessities of  Gervaise as a page. During their term of service the pages received  no remuneration, all their expenses being paid by their families.  Nevertheless, the post was considered so honourable, and of such great  advantage to those entering the Order, that the appointments were  eagerly sought after.    The head of the party was Sir Guy Redcar, who had been a commander in  England, but who was now relinquishing that post in order to take a high  office in the convent at the Island. With him were four lads between  seventeen and twenty who were going out as professed knights, having  served their year of probation as novices at the grand priory. With  these Gervaise was already acquainted, as they had lived, studied, and  performed their military exercises together. The three eldest of these  Gervaise liked much, but the youngest of the party, Robert Rivers, a  relation of the queen, had always shown a very different spirit from  the others. He was jealous that a member of one of the defeated and  disinherited Lancastrian families should obtain a post of such honour  and advantage as that of page to the grand master, and that thus,  although five years younger, Gervaise should enter the Order on an  equality with him.    In point of strength and stature he was, of course, greatly superior  to Gervaise; but he had been spoilt from his childhood, was averse  to exercise, and dull at learning, and while Gervaise was frequently  commended by his instructors, he himself was constantly reproved, and  it had been more than once a question whether he should be received as  a professed knight at the termination of his year of novitiate. Thus,  while the other lads treated Gervaise kindly, and indeed made rather  a pet of him, Robert Rivers ignored him as much as possible, and if  obliged to speak to him did so with a pointed rudeness that more than  once brought upon him a sharp reproof from his companions. Gervaise  himself was but little affected by Robert's manner. He was of an  exceptionally good tempered nature, and, indeed, was so occupied with  his work and so anxious to satisfy his teachers, that Robert's ill  humour passed almost unnoticed.    The journey was performed without incident. During their passage across  the south of France, Gervaise's perfect knowledge of the language gained  for him a great advantage over his companions, and enabled him to be of  much use to Sir Guy. They had fine weather during their passage up the  Mediterranean, and in the day their leader gave them their first lessons  in the management and discipline of a ship.    \"You will be nearly as much at sea as you are on land for the five years  you must stay at the convent,\" he said; \"and it is essential to the  education of a knight of our Order to know all things connected with the  management of a ship, even to its building. We construct our own galleys  at Rhodes, using, of course, the labour of slaves, but under our own  superintendence; and it is even more essential to us to know how to  fight on sea than on land. There is, too, you see, a rivalry among  ourselves, for each langue has its duties, and each strives to perform  more gallant deeds and to bring in more rich prizes than the others. We  of England are among the smallest of the langues, and yet methinks we do  a fair portion of the work, and gain fully our share of honour. There is  no fear of your having much time on your hands, for it is quite certain  that there will soon be open war between Mahomet and the Order. In spite  of the nominal truce, constant skirmishes are taking place, so that, in  addition to our fights with pirates, we have sometimes encounters with  the sultan's galleys.    \"Seven years ago, a number of our Order took part in the defence  of Lesbos, and lost their lives at its capture, and we have sure  information that Mahomet is preparing for an attack on the Island. No  doubt he thinks it will be an easy conquest, for in '57 he succeeded  in landing eighteen thousand men on the Island, and in ravaging a large  district, carrying off much booty. Since then, however, the defences of  Rhodes have been greatly strengthened. Zacosta, our last grand master,  laboured diligently to increase the fortifications, and, specially,  built on one side of the entrance to the harbour a strong tower, called  Fort St. Nicholas. Orsini has carried on the works, which have been  directed by D'Aubusson, who is captain general of the forces of the  Island, and who has deepened the ditches and built a wall on the sea  front of the town six hundred feet in length and twenty feet in height,  money being found by the grand master from his private purse.    \"At present we are not sure whether the great armament that Mahomet is  preparing is intended for the capture of Negropont, which belongs to  Venice, or of Rhodes. Unfortunately Venice and Rhodes are not good  friends. In the course of our war with Egypt in '58 we captured from  some Venetian vessels, in which they were travelling, several Egyptian  merchants with a great store of goods. The Venetians protested that as  the ships were theirs we had no right to interfere with our enemies who  were travelling in them, and, without giving time for the question to  be discussed, at once attacked our galleys, and sent a fleet against  Rhodes. They landed on the Island, and not only pillaged the district  of Halki, but, a number of natives having sought shelter in a cave, the  Venetians blocked up the entrance with brushwood, set it on fire, and  suffocated them all.    \"Shortly afterwards, another and larger fleet appeared off Rhodes, and  demanded the restitution of the Egyptians and their merchandise. There  was a great division of opinion in the council; but, seeing the great  danger that threatened us both from the Turks at Constantinople and the  Venetians, and that it was madness at such a time to engage in war with  a Christian power, the grand master persuaded the council to accede to  their request. There has never been any friendly feeling between Venice  and ourselves since that time. Still, I trust that our common danger  will reunite us, and that whether Negropont or Rhodes is attacked by the  Moslems, we shall render loyal aid to each other.\"    There was great excitement among Gervaise and his companions when it was  announced that Rhodes was in sight, and as they approached the town  they gazed with admiration at the castle with its stately buildings, the  palace of the grand master and the Hospital of St. John, rising above  the lower town, the massive walls strengthened by projecting bastions,  and the fortifications of the ports. Of these there were two, with  separate entrances, divided from each other by a narrow tongue of land.  At its extremity stood Fort St. Nicholas, which was connected by a  strong wall running along the promontory to the town. The inner port,  as it was called, was of greater importance, as it adjoined the town  itself. It was defended in the first place by Fort St. Nicholas, and at  the inner entrance stood the towers of St. John and St. Michael, one  on either side. Into this the vessel was steered. There were many craft  lying there, among them eight or ten of the galleys of the Order.    \"We will go first to the house of our langue,\" Sir Guy said, \"and tell  them to send down slaves to fetch up our baggage; then I will take you,  Gervaise, to Sir Peter D'Aubusson, and hand you over to his care.\"    On landing, Gervaise was surprised at the number of slaves who were  labouring at the public works, and who formed no small proportion of the  population in the streets. Their condition was pitiable. They were, of  course, enemies of Christianity, and numbers of them had been pirates;  but he could not help pitying their condition as they worked in the full  heat of the sun under the vigilant eyes of numbers of overseers, who  carried heavy whips, in addition to their arms. Their progress to the  upper city was slow, for on their way they met many knights, of whom  several were acquainted with Sir Guy; and each, after greeting  him, demanded the latest news from England, and in return gave him  particulars of the state of things at Rhodes.    At last they arrived at the house of the English langue. The Order  was divided into langues or nationalities. Of these there were  eight--Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy, Germany, England, Aragon, and  Castile and Portugal. The French element was by far the strongest. The  Order had been founded in that country, and as it possessed no less than  three langues, and held the greater part of the high official positions  in the Order, it was only kept in check by the other langues acting  together to demand"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4940"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Senior Year at High School (#8)"],[1,"cake.    \"It is so fortunate that that fruit cake fell into the hands of one of  my friends,\" remarked Hippy, as David was about to walk off, his prize  under his arm. \"I adore fruit cake.\"    \"That's no sign that you will ever get a chance at this one,\" replied  David calmly.    \"I shall, I know I shall,\" retorted Hippy, \"You wouldn't betray my young  confidence and dispel my fond hopes by eating it all yourself. You  deserve an awful case of indigestion if you do.\"    \"Children, children, stop squabbling,\" laughed Anne who, looking like a  very demure little gypsy, had slipped up unnoticed. \"Don't worry, Hippy,  I'll see that you are remembered when the famous cake is cut.\"    \"I feel relieved,\" said Hippy, giving her one of his Cheshire Cat grins.  \"I propose that you leave your treasure with this gypsy maid, David, for  the time is flying and we have a great and glorious surprise to spring.\"    \"See you later, Anne,\" said David, looking at his watch. Then taking  Hippy by the arm the two young men hurried out of the hall, leaving Anne  to wonder what the surprise might be.    Turning slowly she was making her way toward the gypsy camp when a voice  called, \"O Anne, wait a minute,\" and Marian Barber fluttered up  accompanied by a tall, dark young man.    \"Miss Pierson, allow me to present Mr. Hammond,\" she said.    The young man bowed rather too elaborately Anne thought, and a wave of  dislike swept over her as she rather coldly acknowledged the  introduction.    \"Mr. Hammond has just come to Oakdale,\" Marian said eagerly. \"He knows  very few people as yet.\"    \"Ah, yes,\" said Mr. Hammond, with a smile that was intended to be  fascinating. \"I am, indeed, a stranger. Miss Barber has kindly  volunteered to introduce me to some of her charming friends, therefore I  trust that in time they will be mine also.\"    Anne murmured some polite reply, and excusing herself walked away.  \"Horrid thing,\" she thought. \"How cruel he looks when he smiles. I  wonder where Marian met him. She seems to be delighted with him.\"    \"Where have you been, Anne?\" asked Grace, as Anne entered the tent where  she and Miriam sat resting preparatory to beginning their dance, when  enough people should gather outside to form a paying audience.    \"Talking to Marian Barber and a young man who is trailing about with  her.\"    \"Did she introduce that man to you?\" exclaimed Grace.    \"Yes,\" replied Anne. \"Did you meet him?\"    \"I did,\" was the answer. \"Isn't he horrid?\"    \"That is precisely what I said,\" replied Anne. \"There is something about  his suave, silky manner that gives me the creeps.\"    \"I hope Marian isn't seriously impressed with him,\" said Grace. \"For  there is something positively sinister about him.\"    Just then Hippy's voice was heard again above the crowd, and the three  girls hurried to the opening in the tent.          CHAPTER VII    A THIEF IN THE NIGHT      \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" cried Hippy. \"We have a noble animal for sale  here. He is tame and gentle. A lady could ride him without fear. He sees  equally well out of both eyes and is neither lame nor spavined. If you  will just stand back a little we will let you see his paces.\"    The crowd drew back on either side of the lane between the rows of tents  and booths and from somewhere in the back there was heard a great pawing  and trampling, with cries of \"Whoa, there! Whoa, there, Lightning!\"    Then down the aisle there dashed the most absurd comic animal that had  ever been seen in Oakdale. A dilapidated old horse, with crooked legs  and sunken sides through which its ribs protruded. He had widely  distended nostrils and his mouth drawn back over huge teeth. One ear lay  flat, while the other stood up straight and wiggled, and his glazed eyes  stared wildly. On his wobbly back sat David, dressed like a jockey and  flourishing a whip.    \"Gentlemen,\" went on Hippy, \"you here behold an animal of splendid  parts. He is pasture-fed and as gentle as a lamb, never kicks--\"    The strange animal here kicked out one of his hind legs so wildly that  David was obliged to hold on with both arms to keep from falling off.    \"He has a happy, sunny nature, ladies. Is there any one present who  would like to try his gait? Ten cents a ride.\"    The horse crossed his front legs and sat down on his haunches with an  air of patient endurance. There were roars of laughter and no one  enjoyed the fun more than Miss Thompson.    \"I declare, Hippy, I should like to have a ride on the back of that  animal!\" she exclaimed, producing ten cents.    David leaped to the ground and gallantly assisted the principal to  mount, while Hippy whispered something into the ear of the horse.    The animal trotted gently up to one end of the room and back, depositing  Miss Thompson safely on her feet.    Miriam Nesbit then took a trial ride and no bucking bronco ever  exhibited such traits of character as did that battered-looking  quadruped. Miriam was obliged to jump down amid the cheers of the  company. Many people rode that night, and rides went up to twenty-five  and even fifty cents, until finally the poor, tired animal lay flat on  the floor in an attitude of complete exhaustion. Then Hippy undid  several hooks and eyes along the imaginary line which divided Lightning  in half, and there came forth, very warm and fatigued, Tom Gray and  Reddy Brooks.    On the whole the bazaar was proving an unqualified success. People  entered into the spirit of the thing and spent their money without a  murmur.    Eleanor's confetti proved a drawing card, and young people and old  wandered about, bestowing handfuls of it upon their friends whenever a  good opportunity presented itself.    Long before the fair was over Grace and Anne retired to one end of the  gypsy encampment to begin counting the proceeds of their labors. The  girls in charge of the various booths turned in their money almost as  rapidly as they made it, and by the time the crowd had begun to thin the  girls had arrived at a tolerably correct estimate of what the bazaar had  netted them.    \"Is it possible that I have counted correctly, Anne!\" exclaimed Grace to  her friend, who was helping to sort small silver into various piles.    \"I don't know,\" said Anne, \"it looks like a lot of money. How much does  it all come to?\"    \"Roughly speaking, nearly five hundred dollars. Just think of that.\"    \"Splendid!\" cried Anne, clasping her hands joyfully. \"But what shall we  put it in?\"    \"I shall put it in this iron box of father's. You see, it has a  combination lock and he loaned it to me to-night just for this purpose.  As soon as the rest of the money is in I'll lock it and he will take  charge of it. Will you go and find him?\"    Anne departed and Grace began to deposit the money in the box, smiling  to herself at the success of their undertaking.    The few remaining people who were now taking leave of each other had  concentrated in one spot. There was a loud buzz of conversation and  laughter, when suddenly, without a moment's warning, the electric lights  went out. The gasoline torches had burned down by now and the place was  in utter darkness.    Somewhere in the hall there was a cry, the sound of scuffling and then  absolute silence.    Many of the men began to strike matches and peer into the darkness, and  at last David groped his way over to a corner of the hall where he  remembered he had seen the switch. As he felt for the electric button  his hand encountered another hand, that grasped his with an iron grip,  gave his wrist a vicious twist, pushed him violently away and was gone.  David gave an involuntary cry of pain as he felt for the switch again.  In another moment he had found it and the hall was again flooded with  light. Instantly he looked about for the vicious person who had twisted  his wrist, but he was alone in that part of the hall.    The excitements of that evening, however, were not yet at an end. People  began running toward the last booth. There were cries and exclamations,  and David, who had followed quickly after them, arrived there just in  time to meet Mr. Harlowe carrying the limp figure of his daughter Grace  in his arms. He deposited her on four chairs placed in a row, a bottle  of smelling salts was put to her nose, while Hippy and Reddy ran for  water.    Grace opened her eyes almost immediately and sat up.    \"I'm not hurt,\" she said. \"I was only stunned. Some one hit me on the  head from behind, but my cap softened the blow. They were trying to get  the box of money. Oh, is it gone?\" she cried anxiously.    David and Tom examined the booth.    The money was gone.          CHAPTER VIII    MARIAN ASSERTS HER INDEPENDENCE      There was not the slightest clue to the thief who had stolen the iron  box containing a little over five hundred dollars, for which the girls  had worked so hard, but the loss was made good by Judge Putnam who,  though on the bench at the state capital at the time the robbery  occurred, had promptly sent Grace his check for the amount when Grace  wrote him an account of it. For which generous act he became the idol of  Oakdale High School.    \"As for the thief,\" observed Mr. Harlowe, several mornings later at the  breakfast table, after Grace had opened the letter and joyfully  exhibited the check to her mother and father; \"he'll have some trouble  opening that box. It was the strongest box I have ever seen of the kind,  made of iron reinforced with steel bands, with a combination lock that  would baffle even your friend, Richards, Grace, who appeared to be a  pretty sharp crook.\"    \"How will the thief get at the money, then, father?\" asked Grace.    \"I can't imagine,\" answered Mr. Harlowe. \"If he tries to blow up the box  he runs the chance of blowing up all the money at the same time, and I  don't believe there is an instrument made that would pry it open. He  can't melt it and he can't knock a hole in it. Therefore, I don't just  see what he can do, unless he finds some"]]]
