Often an  early shipment gets the best price.    At the same time the squabs are sent to market, mail a letter to the  commission man, advising him of the number of birds you sent to him and  by what express company or freight line. Give him any particulars which  may help him to make a good sale, if you think of anything that might  interest him.    In the eastern market squabs are graded by weight and quality. They are  called 10-pound, 9-pound, 8-pound, 7-pound and 6-1/2 pound, and the prices  range accordingly. When 10-pound squabs are worth $6.00 a dozen, those  weighing 6-1/2 pounds will sell for from $1.50 to $2.75 a dozen, according  to the state of the market, the high-priced ones always selling first,  unless a buyer has a special reason for securing a lot of light-weights.    When breeding straight Homers, one can reasonably expect 80 or 90 per  cent which will run 8 pounds or over to the dozen. About two-thirds of  the remainder will run close to 8 pounds to the dozen and one-third will  be classed among the lowest quality.    When 10-pound squabs are selling for $6 a dozen, a lot weighing more  than 10 pounds to the dozen will bring a premium of from 50 cents a  dozen up; but as a rule the most profitable squabs are the 8- and  10-pounders.    In picking squabs, some leave them hanging where they are killed, while  others take them in the hand. The weight of practice is in favor of  holding them in the hand.      NUMBERS OF SQUABS TO THE PAIR    Some enthusiastic or dishonest sellers of breeding pigeons talk about  their birds producing nine or ten pairs of squabs each year. There are  occasional pairs of very select birds which will do this, but they  cannot be bought at any reasonable price. No pair of birds will raise  two squabs every time they hatch, for accidents will happen, and one  squab or both, in some brooding periods, will die. Occasionally an egg  will be broken, and once in a while an egg will prove infertile. These  accidents, which happen in the best cared-for lofts, come to every  pigeon-breeder.    If a large loft of pigeons average six pairs of pigeons a year, it will  do as much as can be expected of it. More will fall below that than run  above it, because there are more careless pigeon-breeders than careful  ones.    Say, for the sake of a basis from which to arrange, that a loft of a  good strain of Homers, properly housed and fed, will produce an average  of six pairs of squabs each year. As pigeons breed ten months in the  year, this average should be easily made. This would be an even dozen  squabs for each pair of pigeons in the loft. These we will put at the  very low price of $3 a dozen, a price they will bring in a country town  of any size, and we have $3 as the gross returns from a pair of fair  breeding Homers.    Deducting from this the highest estimated prices for the feed of a pair  of pigeons, we have $1.75 left. This will be the returns from which the  pigeon-breeder must get his profits. The manure will pay well for the  labor of feeding the birds, so this item is eliminated from the bill of  cost.    It will not cost more than 25 cents per pair to pay for the other labor  of caring for a loft of pigeons where any number above 100 pairs are  kept. The owner of such a loft could do all the work before working  hours in the morning and after hours in the evening so the birds would  not interfere with his regular work.    The cost of ice, the cost of killing and picking the birds, and the cost  of packages may be put at 25 cents a dozen, which is a very liberal  estimate. This leaves $1.25 clear profit, after paying all expenses and  paying the owner for the time he puts in feeding his birds, this work  having been done when he would otherwise have been idle or not earning  money.    Say, it cost $1.00 for each pair of birds kept in a house and the birds  costs $2.50 a pair. The interest on this investment at 6 per cent a year  would be 21 cents, thus leaving $1.04 as absolutely net profit from a  pair of pigeons in a year, after paying all expenses at a liberal rate  and paying good interest on the investment.    There is no other business open to those who have a small capital which  will give such large returns. For every 100 pairs of pigeons kept, it is  perfectly safe to say that a clean and clear profit of $100 may be made.  Where a large number are kept, it is not uncommon for the owner to  realize $1.50 net profit from a pair of Homers.    The one who begins with ten, twenty-five, or fifty pairs of birds will  get proportionate returns from his investment in the way of increased  number in his flock and will soon be in position to consider himself an  extensive pigeon-breeder, because he may expect to have at least four  pairs of first-class breeders from each pair he started with at the  beginning of any year, having kept only the best and sold the poorest of  the squabs. These estimates are very conservative for it is our  intention in this book to give the beginner only the facts on which he  may rely. If he fails to do much better than these figures after some  experience in the business, he may well feel that he is not gaining the  fullest measure of success.    The business is only in its infancy and those who start in now or any  time soon may expect to reap a rich reward in the way of profits.

Just Prime for Market.]          CHAPTER VII    DISEASES OF PIGEONS      The very best way to escape trouble from diseases among pigeons is to  prevent them by always keeping the lofts and flies in first-class  condition. Carelessness is the worst disease that affects pigeons, and  this is always manifest in the owner before it has any effect on the  birds.    If the lofts are kept clean, the feed supplied is sound and sweet, the  water pure and the feeding regular, the birds themselves will not often  be troubled with diseases of any kind.    However, with all possible care, diseases will appear at times, and it  is well to know what to do to prevent them from spreading and causing  serious loss.    Epidemic diseases will never appear in a flock which has been properly  cared for, unless they are brought in through putting newly purchased  birds among the healthy ones.    It is just as well to use caution when introducing new birds even if  there is not the least suspicion that they are not perfectly healthy.    When new stock is bought it should be kept by itself for a week to  determine if it is free from disease. Not once in a hundred times will  birds bought of a reliable breeder be found unhealthy, but prevention is  better than cure any time, so precautions should be taken. In such cases  it is much better to be over cautious than to have losses occur through  lack of precaution.      GOING LIGHT    \"Going Light\" is the common name for tuberculosis in pigeons. It is  brought on by drinking impure water, eating unsound feed, lack of good  supply of grit, or from natural lack of vitality. This disease never  attacks healthy and vigorous birds, but takes for its victims those  which have become weak from any reason. If it is not taken in hand at  once, the bird wastes away and becomes nothing but \"skin and bones\" and  dies. The first symptoms are usually diarrhoea, the droppings being thin  and watery. The bird does not eat, but sits around with its head drawn  down and really starves to death because it has no appetite to eat.    If a bird which has started to go light, is taken in hand at once it is  very often possible to save it for future usefulness. Give it a dose of  castor oil, giving about five or six drops. Put in a coop by itself and  the next day give it ten drops of cod liver oil. Repeat the dose of cod  liver oil every day until the bird is cured. Give it hempseed every day  and be very certain the seed is sound and free from mustiness. A good  health grit or tonic is the best preventive to be used.      CANKER    Canker is a disease of the same nature as diphtheria in human beings. It  appears occasionally in lofts where it never before has been found, and  seems to be contracted from germs which float in the air. It often  attacks the birds in one nest and not the one next to it, although if it  is not taken in hand it will soon spread to all the birds in the loft.    It no doubt comes from a cold very often and for that reason birds which  show symptoms of having caught cold should be carefully watched. The  first appearance of this disease shows in little yellowish white  blisters on the lining or mucous membrane of the mouth and throat. These  rapidly increase in size and spread to other parts of the throat and  form a cheesy growth until they show outside around the mouth, and the  bird chokes to death.    When canker appears in a squab only and the parent bird shows no sign of  it, the best thing to do is to kill the squab, disinfect the loft and  stay the disease in this way. It may be cured by using a little  patience, unless it has gone too far before it is discovered.    Remove the sick bird from the loft and keep it in some place not  adjacent to the pigeon house. Take a small sharp splinter of wood, such  as sharpened match, and scrape the cankers off, doing this as gently as  possible. This will leave a raw red spot, which should be gently swabbed  with a solution of peroxide of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37904"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 4, November 1, 1851 (#8)"],[1,"falls behind. Fearing the cost  of a family, many men remain unmarried, and in no country in the world are  there so many old maids as in the United States.\" From which the author  finds that dreadful instances of immorality and infanticide result.    Filial duty, he asserts, is unknown. When the son proposes emigration to  another place, or the undertaking of a new business, he announces it to his  father \"perhaps the evening before; while the daughters act in like manner  as regards marriage, or, it may be, mention it to him for the first time  after it has really taken place--from which the custom results that parents  give their children no part of their property before death. Nothing is  known of a true family life, in which parents are intimately allied to  children, or brothers and sisters to each other.\" We spare our readers the  sneer at those writers who have praised the Americans in their domestic  relations, with which this veracious, high-minded, and unprejudiced chapter  concludes.    In science and art, we are sunk, it seems, almost beneath contempt; the  former being cultivated only so far as it is conducive to money-making. The  professions of Divinity, Law, and Medicine, are badly and superficially  taught and acquired. \"There are, indeed,\" says the doctor, \"in New-York and  Philadelphia, institutions where the student has opportunities of becoming,  if he will, an excellent physician; but these are far from being well  patronized.\"    As regards general education, he asserts that, though a few professors in  our colleges are highly educated men, this cannot be said of their pupils,  since the latter set no value on knowledge not directly profitable, \"and  the backward condition of ancient languages, natural science, even  geography, history and statistics, save as applicable to their own country,  is really a matter of wonder.\"    But in the fine arts, it appears, we are sunk so far beneath contempt that  we really wonder that the doctor should have found it, in this particular,  worth while to abuse us. \"There are but two monuments in all America worthy  of mention, and both are in Baltimore. Philadelphia and New-York have  nothing of the kind to show, though each city possesses two public squares  or parks planted with trees, which are well adapted to receive such works  of art, and where the eye sadly misses them.\" \"Public and private  collections of statues and pictures are altogether wanting, and the walls  of the rich are generally devoid of paintings and copper-plate engravings.  What they have generally consists of family portraits, or those of  Washington and other presidents. But to dazzle the eye, we find in the  possession of the wealthy, the most worthless pictures in expensive gold  frames. Of late years a public gallery has been established in New-York for  the sale of such productions. As far however as the works of native artists  are concerned, we find among them none inspired by high art; on the  contrary, they are generally, to the last degree, mediocre affairs, or mere  daubs (_wahre Klecksereien_) not worth hanging up; the better however are  exaggerated and unnatural both in subject and color. This is also the case  with most of the copper-plate engravings exposed for sale in the French  shop-windows, and which appear almost as if manufactured in Paris expressly  for the American taste. The inferior appreciation of art in the Americans  and their delight in extravagance is particularly shown in the political  caricatures, which are entirely deficient in all refined wit, consisting  either of stupid allusions to eminent men or party leaders, or direct and  clumsy exaggerations.\"    By way of amends for all this abuse, our author admits that we excel in all  practical arts and labor-saving inventions. \"But in proportion to the  backward state of the fine arts, is the advance which the Americans have  made in all pertaining to mechanics, and technical art. Particular  attention is paid to the supplanting of hand labor by machinery. Even the  most trifling apparatus or tool is constructed with regard to practical  use, and it only needs a more careful observation of this to convince us  that in all such matters they have the advantage of Germany.    \"It is often truly startling to see how simply and usefully those articles  used in business are constructed--for example, the one-horse cars (_drays  or trucks?_) and hand-carts, employed in conveying merchandise to and from  stores. As a proof how far the Americans have advanced in mechanic arts, we  may mention that high houses, of wood or brick, several stories high and  entire, are transported on rollers to places several feet distant.  Occasionally, to add a story, the house is raised by screws into the air  and the building substructed. In either case the family remains quietly  dwelling therein.\"    But alas, even these few rays of commendatory comfort vanish in the dark,  after reflection, that it is precisely this ingenuity and enterprise in  business and practical matters which unfits us for all the kinder and more  social duties, and renders us insensible to every soothing and refining  influence. No allowance for past events, unavoidable circumstances, or our  possible future destiny, appears to cross the doctor's mind. All is dark  and desolate. True, every man of high and low degree--the laborer and  shop-man--the lawyer and clergyman, pause in the street to study any  mechanical novelty which meets their eye--but ere they do this the doctor  is mindful to suggest _that they pass picture shop-windows without deigning  to glance therein_. The professions are studied like trades, and in matters  of criminal law our condition is truly deplorable. It happened not many  months since, he informs us, that the publisher of a slanderous New-York  paper, was castigated by a lady, with a hunting whip, in Broadway, at noon.  The said lady had been (according to custom) unjustly and cruelly abused in  the journal referred to. So great was her irritation that she actually  followed the editor along the streets, lashing him continually. But the  _finale_ of this startling incident consists of the fact that the lady, on  pleading guilty, was fined six cents.    There is an obscurity attached to his manner of narrating this anecdote,  which leaves the opinion of the author a little uncertain. Six cents would  in some parts of Germany be a serious fine, worthy of appeal, mercy, and  abatement. In different parts of Suabia and even Baden, notices may be seen  posted up, in which the commission of certain local offences is prohibited  by fines ranging from four to twelve cents. On the whole, as a zealous  defender of the purity and dignity of woman, when unjustly assailed, we are  inclined to think that the author sides with _the_ LADY.    But we need not follow the doctor further in his career of discontent and  prejudice. Before concluding, we would however caution the reader against  supposing that he expresses views in any degree accordant with the feelings  and opinions of his countrymen. The best, the most numerous, the most  impartial, and we may add, by far the most favorable works on America, are  from German pens. In confirmation of our assertion that his work is  unfavorably regarded at home we may adduce the fact that it has been  severely handled by excellent reviewers among them; take for example the  following, from the Leipzig _Central Blatt_. After favorably noticing the  late excellent work of QUENTIN on the United States, he proceeds to say of  the doctor's _Sketches_, that    \"HERR KIRSTEN seems to desire to be that for North America, which _Nicolai_  of noted memory was in his own time for Italy. Already, on arrival, we find  him in ill temper, caused by the excessive heat, which ill-humor is  aggravated by his being obliged to make many calls by day, and _the  musquitoes and alarms of fire which disturbed his slumbers during the  night_. In other places he was no better pleased.    \"The Germans were disagreeable on account of their want of unity, the  Americans from their coldness--in short, he missed home life--could not  accustom himself to the new country, and returned after a sojourn of less  than two years to Germany. In 'sketches,' resulting from such  circumstances, we naturally encounter only the darker side of American  life. Much may indeed be true of what he asserts regarding the natural  capabilities, climate, soil, and inhabitants of the land, the manners and  customs of the latter, their common and party spirit, education of  children, and the condition of science and art; but particulars are either  too hastily generalized, or else the better points, as for example, the  characteristic traits of the people, their extraordinary progress in  physical and mental culture, and the excellent management of the country,  are either entirely omitted or receive by far too slight notice. His  narrow-minded and ill-natured disposition to find fault is also shown by  his reproaching the Americans with faults which they share in common with  every nation in America, _ourselves included_, as, for example, excesses  committed by political partisans. Still, the book may not be entirely  without value, at least to those who see every thing on the other side of  the water only in a rosy light, and believe that the German emigrant as  soon as his foot touches shore, enters a state of undisturbed happiness.\"    So much for the critical doctor's popularity at home. In conclusion, we may  remark that our main object in this notice, in addition to amusing our  readers, has been to prove by this exception, and the displeasure which it  excites in Germany, the rule, that by the writers of that country our own  has been almost invariably well spoken of. And we have deemed these remarks  the more requisite, lest some reader might casually infer that Dr. Kirsten  expressed the views and sentiments of any"]]]
