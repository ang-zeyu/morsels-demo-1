The French  assemblies under the Restored Monarchy seem to have been quieter,  probably because being elected from a limited constituency they did not  contain so many sections of opinion; they had fewer irritants and fewer  species of irritability. But the assemblies of the '48 Republic were  disorderly in the extreme. I saw the last myself, and can certify that  steady discussion upon a critical point was not possible in it. There  was not an audience willing to hear. The Assembly now sitting at  Versailles is undoubtedly also, at times, most tumultuous, and a  Parliamentary government in which it governs must be under a peculiar  difficulty, because as a sovereign it is unstable, capricious, and  unruly.    The difficulty is the greater because there is no check, or little,  from the French nation upon the Assembly. The French, as a nation, do  not care for or appreciate Parliamentary government. I have endeavoured  to explain how difficult it is for inexperienced mankind to take to  such a government; how much more natural, that is, how much more easy  to uneducated men is loyalty to a monarch. A nation which does not  expect good from a Parliament, cannot check or punish a Parliament.  France expects, I fear, too little from her Parliaments ever to get  what she ought. Now that the suffrage is universal, the average  intellect and the average culture of the constituent bodies are  excessively low; and even such mind and culture as there is has long  been enslaved to authority; the French peasant cares more for standing  well with his present prefet than for anything else whatever; he is far  too ignorant to check and watch his Parliament, and far too timid to  think of doing either if the executive authority nearest to him does  not like it. The experiment of a strictly Parliamentary Republic--of a  Republic where the Parliament appoints the executive--is being tried in  France at an extreme disadvantage, because in France a Parliament is  unusually likely to be bad, and unusually likely also to be free enough  to show its badness. Secondly, the present polity of France is not a  copy of the whole effective part of the British Constitution, but only  a part of it. By our Constitution nominally the Queen, but really the  Prime Minister, has the power of dissolving the Assembly. But M. Thiers  has no such power; and therefore, under ordinary circumstances, I  believe, the policy would soon become unmanageable. The result would  be, as I have tried to explain, that the Assembly would be always  changing its Ministry, that having no reason to fear the penalty which  that change so often brings in England, they would be ready to make it  once a month. Caprice is the characteristic vice of miscellaneous  assemblies, and without some check their selection would be unceasingly  mutable. This peculiar danger of the present Constitution of France has  however been prevented by its peculiar circumstances. The Assembly have  not been inclined to remove M. Thiers, because in their lamentable  present position they could not replace M. Thiers. He has a monopoly of  the necessary reputation. It is the Empire--the Empire which he always  opposed--that has done him this kindness. For twenty years no great  political reputation could arise in France. The Emperor governed and no  one member could show a capacity for government. M. Rouher, though of  vast real ability, was in the popular idea only the Emperor's agent;  and even had it been otherwise, M. Rouher, the one great man of  Imperialism, could not have been selected as a head of the Government,  at a moment of the greatest reaction against the Empire. Of the chiefs  before the twenty years' silence, of the eminent men known to be able  to handle Parliaments and to govern Parliaments, M. Thiers was the only  one still physically able to begin again to do so. The miracle is, that  at seventy-four even he should still be able. As no other great chief  of the Parliament regime existed, M. Thiers is not only the best  choice, but the only choice. If he were taken away, it would be most  difficult to make any other choice, and that difficulty keeps him where  he is. At every crisis the Assembly feels that after M. Thiers \"the  deluge,\" and he lives upon that feeling. A change of the President,  though legally simple, is in practice all but impossible; because all  know that such a change might be a change, not only of the President,  but of much more too: that very probably it might be a change of the  polity--that it might bring in a Monarchy or an Empire.    Lastly, by a natural consequence of the position, M. Thiers does not  govern as a Parliamentary Premier governs. He is not, he boasts that he  is not, the head of a party. On the contrary, being the one person  essential to all parties, he selects Ministers from all parties, he  constructs a Cabinet in which no one Minister agrees with any other in  anything, and with all the members of which he himself frequently  disagrees. The selection is quite in his hand. Ordinarily a  Parliamentary Premier cannot choose; he is brought in by a party; he is  maintained in office by a party; and that party requires that as they  aid him, he shall aid them; that as they give him the very best thing  in the State, he shall give them the next best things. But M. Thiers is  under no such restriction. He can choose as he likes, and does choose.  Neither in the selection of his Cabinet nor in the management of the  Chamber, is M. Thiers guided as a similar person in common  circumstances would have to be guided. He is the exception of a moment;  he is not the example of a lasting condition.    For these reasons, though we may use the present Constitution of France  as a useful aid to our imaginations, in conceiving of a purely  Parliamentary Republic, of a monarchy minus the monarch, we must not  think of it as much more. It is too singular in its nature and too  peculiar in its accidents to be a guide to anything except itself.    In this essay I made many remarks on the American Constitution, in  comparison with the English; and as to the American Constitution we  have had a whole world of experience since I first wrote. My great  object was to contrast the office of President as an executive officer  and to compare it with that of a Prime Minister; and I devoted much  space to showing that in one principal respect the English system is by  far the best. The English Premier being appointed by the selection, and  being removable at the pleasure, of the preponderant Legislative  Assembly, is sure to be able to rely on that Assembly. If he wants  legislation to aid his policy he can obtain that legislation; he can  carry out that policy. But the American President has no similar  security. He is elected in one way, at one time, and Congress (no  matter which House) is elected in another way, at another time. The two  have nothing to bind them together, and in matter of fact, they  continually disagree.    This was written in the time of Mr. Lincoln, when Congress, the  President, and all the North were united as one man in the war against  the South. There was then no patent instance of mere disunion. But  between the time when the essays were first written in the Fortnightly,  and their subsequent junction into a book, Mr. Lincoln was  assassinated, and Mr. Johnson, the Vice-President, became President,  and so continued for nearly four years. At such a time the  characteristic evils of the Presidential system were shown most  conspicuously. The President and the Assembly, so far from being (as it  is essential to good government that they should be) on terms of close  union, were not on terms of common courtesy. So far from being capable  of a continuous and concerted co-operation they were all the while  trying to thwart one another. He had one plan for the pacification of  the South and they another; they would have nothing to say to his  plans, and he vetoed their plans as long as the Constitution permitted,  and when they were, in spite of him, carried, he, as far as he could  (and this was very much), embarrassed them in action. The quarrel in  most countries would have gone beyond the law, and come to blows; even  in America, the most law-loving of countries, it went as far as  possible within the law. Mr. Johnson described the most popular branch  of the legislature--the House of Representatives--as a body \"hanging on  the verge of government\"; and that House impeached him criminally, in  the hope that in that way they might get rid of him civilly. Nothing  could be so conclusive against the American Constitution, as a  Constitution, as that incident. A hostile legislature and a hostile  executive were so tied together, that the legislature tried, and tried  in vain, to rid itself of the executive by accusing it of illegal  practices. The legislature was so afraid of the President's legal power  that it unfairly accused him of acting beyond the law. And the blame  thus cast on the American Constitution is so much praise to be given to  the American political character.    Few nations, perhaps scarcely any nation, could have borne such a trial  so easily and so perfectly. This was the most striking instance of  disunion between the President and the Congress that has ever yet  occurred, and which probably will ever occur. Probably for very many  years the United States will have great and painful reason to remember  that at the moment of all their history, when it was most important to  them to collect and concentrate all the strength and wisdom of their  policy on the pacification of the South, that policy was divided by a  strife in the last degree unseemly and degrading. But it will be for a  competent historian hereafter to trace out this accurately and in  detail; the time is yet too recent, and I cannot pretend that I know  enough to do so. I cannot venture myself to draw the full lessons from  these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#8)"],[1,"vision assumed a more definite  aspect. The forms grew rounder, the bodies rolled together and seemed  to pick themselves up like balls. Then at last appeared the image  towards which the whole of this scene had doubtless been unconsciously  evolving--large rubber balls hurled against one another in every  direction. The second scene, though even coarser than the first, was no  less instructive. There came on the stage two men, each with an  enormous head, bald as a billiard ball. In their hands they carried  large sticks which each, in turn, brought down on to the other's  cranium. Here, again, a certain gradation was observable. After each  blow, the bodies seemed to grow heavier and more unyielding,  overpowered by an increasing degree of rigidity. Then came the return  blow, in each case heavier and more resounding than the last, coming,  too, after a longer interval. The skulls gave forth a formidable ring  throughout the silent house. At last the two bodies, each quite rigid  and as straight as an arrow, slowly bent over towards each other, the  sticks came crashing down for the last time on to the two heads with a  thud as of enormous mallets falling upon oaken beams, and the pair lay  prone upon the ground. At that instant appeared in all its vividness  the suggestion that the two artists had gradually driven into the  imagination of the spectators: \"We are about to become ...we have now  become solid wooden dummies.\"    A kind of dim, vague instinct may enable even an uncultured mind to get  an inkling here of the subtler results of psychological science. We  know that it is possible to call up hallucinatory visions in a  hypnotised subject by simple suggestion. If he be told that a bird is  perched on his hand, he will see the bird and watch it fly away. The  idea suggested, however, is far from being always accepted with like  docility. Not infrequently, the mesmeriser only succeeds in getting an  idea into his subject's head by slow degrees through a carefully  graduated series of hints. He will then start with objects really  perceived by the subject, and will endeavour to make the perception of  these objects more and more indefinite; then, step by step, he will  bring out of this state of mental chaos the precise form of the object  of which he wishes to create an hallucination. Something of the kind  happens to many people when dropping off to sleep; they see those  coloured, fluid, shapeless masses, which occupy the field of vision,  insensibly solidifying into distinct objects.    Consequently, the gradual passing from the dim and vague to the clear  and distinct is the method of suggestion par excellence. I fancy it  might be found to be at the root of a good many comic suggestions,  especially in the coarser forms of the comic, in which the  transformation of a person into a thing seems to be taking place before  our eyes. But there are other and more subtle methods in use, among  poets, for instance, which perhaps unconsciously lead to the same end.  By a certain arrangement of rhythm, rhyme and assonance, it is possible  to lull the imagination, to rock it to and fro between like and like  with a regular see-saw motion, and thus prepare it submissively to  accept the vision suggested. Listen to these few lines of Regnard, and  see whether something like the fleeting image of a DOLL does not cross  the field of your imagination:    ... Plus, il doit a maints particuliers La somme de dix mil une livre  une obole, Pour l'avoir sans relache un an sur sa parole Habille,  voiture, chauffe, chausse, gante, Alimente, rase, desaltere, porte.    [Footnote: Further, he owes to many an honest wight Item-the sum two  thousand pounds, one farthing, For having on his simple word of honour  Sans intermission for an entire year Clothed him, conveyed him, warmed  him, shod him, gloved him, Fed him and shaved him, quenched his thirst  and borne him.]    Is not something of the same kind found in the following sally of  Figaro's (though here an attempt is perhaps made to suggest the image  of an animal rather than that of a thing): \"Quel homme est-ce?--C'est  un beau, gros, court, jeune vieillard, gris pommele, ruse, rase, blase,  qui guette et furette, et gronde et geint tout a la fois.\" [Footnote:  \"What sort of man is here?--He is a handsome, stout, short, youthful  old gentleman, iron-grey, an artful knave, clean shaved, clean 'used  up,' who spies and pries and growls and groans all in the same breath.\"]    Now, between these coarse scenes and these subtle suggestions there is  room for a countless number of amusing effects, for all those that can  be obtained by talking about persons as one would do about mere things.  We will only select one or two instances from the plays of Labiche, in  which they are legion.    Just as M. Perrichon is getting into the railway carriage, he makes  certain of not forgetting any of his parcels: \"Four, five, six, my wife  seven, my daughter eight, and myself nine.\" In another play, a fond  father is boasting of his daughter's learning in the following terms:  \"She will tell you, without faltering, all the kings of France that  have occurred.\" This phrase, \"that have occurred,\" though not exactly  transforming the kings into mere things, likens them, all the same, to  events of an impersonal nature.    As regards this latter example, note that it is unnecessary to complete  the identification of the person with the thing in order to ensure a  comic effect. It is sufficient for us to start in this direction by  feigning, for instance, to confuse the person with the function he  exercises. I will only quote a sentence spoken by a village mayor in  one of About's novels: \"The prefect, who has always shown us the same  kindness, though he has been changed several times since 1847...\"    All these witticisms are constructed on the same model. We might make  up any number of them, when once we are in possession of the recipe.  But the art of the story-teller or the playwright does not merely  consist in concocting jokes. The difficulty lies in giving to a joke  its power of suggestion, i.e. in making it acceptable. And we only do  accept it either because it seems to be the natural product of a  particular state of mind or because it is in keeping with the  circumstances of the case. For instance, we are aware that M. Perrichon  is greatly excited on the occasion of his first railway journey. The  expression \"to occur\" is one that must have cropped up a good many  times in the lessons repeated by the girl before her father; it makes  us think of such a repetition. Lastly, admiration of the governmental  machine might, at a pinch, be extended to the point of making us  believe that no change takes place in the prefect when he changes his  name, and that the function gets carried on independently of the  functionary.    We have now reached a point very far from the original cause of  laughter. Many a comic form, that cannot be explained by itself, can  indeed only be understood from its resemblance to another, which only  makes us laugh by reason of its relationship with a third, and so on  indefinitely, so that psychological analysis, however luminous and  searching, will go astray unless it holds the thread along which the  comic impression has travelled from one end of the series to the other.  Where does this progressive continuity come from? What can be the  driving force, the strange impulse which causes the comic to glide thus  from image to image, farther and farther away from the starting-point,  until it is broken up and lost in infinitely remote analogies? But what  is that force which divides and subdivides the branches of a tree into  smaller boughs and its roots into radicles? An inexorable law dooms  every living energy, during the brief interval allotted to it in time,  to cover the widest possible extent in space. Now, comic fancy is  indeed a living energy, a strange plant that has nourished on the stony  portions of the social soil, until such time as culture should allow it  to vie with the most refined products of art. True, we are far from  great art in the examples of the comic we have just been reviewing. But  we shall draw nearer to it, though without attaining to it completely,  in the following chapter. Below art, we find artifice, and it is this  zone of artifice, midway between nature and art, that we are now about  to enter. We are going to deal with the comic playwright and the wit.          CHAPTER II    THE COMIC ELEMENT IN SITUATIONS AND THE COMIC ELEMENT IN WORDS      I    We have studied the comic element in forms, in attitudes, and in  movements generally; now let us look for it in actions and in  situations. We encounter, indeed, this kind of comic readily enough in  everyday life. It is not here, however, that it best lends itself to  analysis. Assuming that the stage is both a magnified and a simplified  view of life, we shall find that comedy is capable of furnishing us  with more information than real life on this particular part of our  subject. Perhaps we ought even to carry simplification still farther,  and, going back to our earliest recollections, try to discover, in the  games that amused us as children, the first faint traces of the  combinations that make us laugh as grown-up persons. We are too apt to  speak of our feelings of pleasure and of pain as though full grown at  birth, as though each one of them had not a history of its own. Above  all, we are too apt to ignore the childish element, so to speak, latent  in most of our joyful emotions. And yet, how many of our present  pleasures, were we to examine them closely, would shrink into nothing  more than memories of past ones! What would there be left of many of  our emotions were we to reduce them to the exact quantum of pure  feeling they contain, by subtracting from them all that is merely  reminiscence? Indeed, it seems possible that, after a certain age, we  become "]]]
