I had not heard of  Eldred's death, though two days since the rumour of a heavy defeat of  the East Angles at Kesteven, and the sacrilegious destruction of the  holy houses of Bardenay, Croyland, and Medeshamsted reached our ears.  Were you present at the battle?\"    \"I was, sir king,\" Egbert said, \"and fought beside Earl Algar and my  kinsman the Ealdorman Eldred until both were slain by the Danes, and I  with difficulty cut my way through them and escaped to carry out my  kinsman's orders regarding his son.\"    \"You are a stout champion yourself,\" the king said, regarding with  admiration Egbert's huge proportions; \"but tell us the story of this  battle, of which at present but vague rumours have reached us.\" Egbert  related the incidents of the battle of Kesteven. \"It was bravely  fought,\" the king said when he had concluded; \"right well and bravely,  and better fortune should have attended such valour. Truly the brave  Algar has shown that we Saxons have not lost the bravery which  distinguished our ancestors, and that, man for man, we are equal to  these heathen Danes.\"    \"But methinks,\" Prince Alfred said, \"that the brave Algar and his  valiant companions did wrong to throw away their lives when all was  lost. So long as there is the remotest chance of victory it is the duty  of a leader to set an example of valour to his followers, but when all  is lost he should think of his country. What though the brave thanes  slew each a score of Danes before they died, their death has left their  countrymen without a leader, and by that one battle the Danes have made  themselves masters of the north of East Anglia. Better far had they,  when the day was lost, retreated, to gather the people together when a  better opportunity presented itself, and again to make head against the  invaders. It is heathen rather than Christian warfare thus to throw  away their lives rather than to retreat and wait for God's time to come  again. To stake all on one throw, which if lost loses a whole people,  seems to me the act of a gamester. I trust that, should the time ever  come, as it is too much to be feared it will ere long, that the Danes  invade my brother's kingdom of Wessex, I shall not be found wanting in  courage; but assuredly when defeated in battle I would not throw away  my life, for that belongs to our people rather than to myself, but  would retire to some refuge until I could again gather the Saxons  around me and attack the invaders. I like the face of the young  ealdorman, and doubt not that he will prove a valiant warrior like his  father. My brother will doubtless assign him lands for his maintenance  and yours; but if he will let me I will attach him to my person, and  will be at once a master and a friend to him. Wouldst thou like this,  young Edmund?\"    The lad, greatly pleased at the young prince's kindness of speech and  manner, replied enthusiastically that he would follow him to the death  if he would accept him as his faithful thane.    \"Had the times been more peaceful, Edmund,\" Alfred said, \"I would fain  have imparted to you some of the little knowledge that I have gained,  for I see an intelligence in your face which tells me that you would  have proved an apt and eager pupil; but, alas, in the days that are  coming it is the sword rather than the book which will prevail, and the  cares of state, and the defence of the country, will shortly engross  all my time and leave me but little leisure for the studies I love so  well.\"    \"There are the lands,\" the king said, \"of Eabald, Ealdorman of  Sherborne, in Dorset. He died but last week and has left no children.  These lands I will grant to Edmund in return for liege and true  service.\" The lad knelt before the king, and, kissing his hand, swore  to be his true and faithful thane, and to spend land, goods, and life  in his service.    \"And now,\" the king said, \"since the audience is over, and none other  comes before us with petitions, we will retire to our private  apartments, and there my brother Alfred will present you to the fair  Elswitha, his wife.\"    The room into which Egbert and Edmund followed the king and his brother  was spacious and lofty. The walls were covered with hangings of red  cloth, and a thick brown baize covered the floor. The ceiling was  painted a dark brown with much gilding. Round the sides of the room  stood several dressers of carved oak, upon which stood gold and silver  cups.    On a table were several illuminated vellums. At Croyland Edmund had  seen a civilization far in advance of that to which he had been  accustomed in his father's abode; but he saw here a degree of luxury  and splendour which surprised him. Alfred had, during his two visits to  Rome, learned to appreciate the high degree of civilization which  reigned there, and many of the articles of furniture and other objects  which met Edmund's eye he had brought with him on his return with his  father from that city.    Across the upper end of the room was a long table laid with a white  cloth. Elswitha was sitting in a large gilded chair by the great fire  which was blazing on the hearth.    Prince Alfred presented Edmund and Egbert to her. Elswitha was well  acquainted with the Ealdorman Eldred, as his lands lay on the very  border of her native Mercia, and she received the lad and his kinsman  with great kindness. In a short time they took their places at table.  First the attendance brought in bowls containing broth, which they  presented, kneeling, to each of those at table. The broth was drunk  from the bowl itself; then a silver goblet was placed by each diner,  and was filled with wine. Fish was next served. Plates were placed  before each; but instead of their cutting food with their own daggers,  as Edmund had been accustomed to see in his father's house, knives were  handed round. After the fish came venison, followed by wild boar,  chickens, and other meats. After these confections, composed chiefly of  honey, were placed on the table. The king and Prince Alfred pledged  their guests when they drank. No forks were used, the meat as cut being  taken up by pieces of bread to the mouth. During the meal a harper  played and sung.    Edmund observed the decorum with which his royal hosts fed, and the  care which they took to avoid dipping their fingers into their saucers  or their plates. He was also struck with the small amount of wine which  they took; for the Saxons in general were large feeders, and drank  heavily at their meals.    When the dinner was over a page brought round a basin of warm water, in  which lavender had been crushed, and each dipped his fingers in this  and then dried them on the cloth. Then at Prince Alfred's request  Egbert again related in full the details of the two days' desperate  struggle at Kesteven, giving the most minute particulars of the Danes'  method of fighting. Egbert and Edmund then retired to the royal  guest-house adjoining the palace, where apartments were assigned to  them.    After remaining for a week at Reading they took leave of the king and  started for the lands which he had assigned to Edmund. They were  accompanied by an officer of the royal household, who was to inform the  freemen and serfs of the estate that by the king's pleasure Edmund had  been appointed ealdorman of the lands. They found on arrival that the  house had been newly built, and was large and comfortable. The thanes  of the district speedily came in to pay their respects to their new  ealdorman, and although surprised to find him so young, they were  pleased with his bearing and manner, and knowing that he came of good  fighting blood doubted not that in time he would make a valiant leader.  All who came were hospitably entertained, and for many days there was  high feasting. So far removed was this part of England from the  district which the Danes had invaded, that at present but slight alarm  had been caused by them; but Edmund and his kinsman lost no time in  impressing upon them the greatness of the coming danger.    \"You may be sure,\" he said, \"that ere long we shall see their galleys  on the coast. When they have eaten up Mercia and Anglia they will  assuredly come hither, and we shall have to fight for our lives, and  unless we are prepared it will go hard with us.\"    After he had been at his new residence for a month Edmund sent out  messengers to all the thanes in his district requesting them to  assemble at a council, and then formally laid the matter before them.    \"It is, above all things,\" he said, \"necessary that we should have some  place where we can place the women and children in case of invasion and  where we can ourselves retire in extreme necessity. Therefore I propose  that we shall build a fort of sufficient size to contain all the  inhabitants of the district, with many flocks and herds. My cousin  Egbert has ridden far over the country, and recommends that the Roman  fortification at Moorcaster shall be utilized. It is large in extent,  and has a double circle of earthen banks. These differ from those which  we are wont to build, since we Saxons always fill up the ground so as  to be flat with the top of the earthen banks, while the Romans left  theirs hollow. However, the space is so large that it would take a vast  labour to fill it up, therefore I propose that we should merely thicken  the banks, and should, in Saxon custom, build a wall with turrets upon  them. The sloping banks alone would be but a small protection against  the onslaught of the Danes, but stone walls are another matter, and  could only be carried after a long siege. If you fall in with my views  you will each of you send half your serfs to carry out the work, and I  will do the same, and will, moreover, pay fifty freemen who may do the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36764"],[0,"In the Track of the Bookworm (#8)"],[1,",  and I have more than once improved my subject by a second treatment.    There is another form of illustration, of which I have not spoken, and  that is the insertion of clippings from magazines and newspapers in the  fly leaves. Sometimes these are of intense interest. My own Dickens,  Thackeray and Hawthorne, in particular have their porticoes and posterms  plentifully supplied with material of this sort. The latest contribution  of this kind is to \"Martin Chuzzlewit,\" and consists in the information  that a western American \"land-shark\" has recently swindled people by  selling them swamp-lots, attractively depicted on a map and named Eden.  In my Pepys I have laid Mr. Lang's recent letter to the diarist. So on a  fly leaf of Hawthorne's Life it is pleasing to see a cut of his little red  house at Lenox, now destroyed by fire.          IX.    BOOK-PLATES.      A rather modern form of book-spoliation has arisen in the collection of  book-plates. These are literally derived \"ex libris,\" and the business  cannot be indulged, as a general thing, without in some sense despoiling  books. It cannot be denied that it is a fascinating pursuit. So  undoubtedly is the taking of watches or rings or other \"articles of  bigotry or virtue,\" on the highway. But somehow there is something so  essentially personal in a book-plate, that it is hard to understand why  other persons than the owners should become possessed by a passion for it.  Many years ago when Burton, the great comedian, was in his prime, he used  to act in a farce called \"Toodles\"--at all events, that was his name in  the play--and he was afflicted with a wife who had a mania for attending  auctions and buying all kinds of things, useful or useless, provided that  they only seemed cheap. One day she came home with a door-plate,  inscribed, \"Thompson\"--\"Thompson with a p,\" as Toodles wrathfully  described it; and this was more than Toodles could stand. He could not see  what possible use there could ever be in that door-plate for the Toodles  family. In those same days, there used to be displayed on the door of a  modest house, on the east side of Broadway, in the city of New York,  somewhere about Eighth Street, a silver door-plate inscribed, \"Mr. Astor.\"  This appertained to the original John Jacob. In those days I frequently  remarked it, and thought what a prize it would be to Mrs. Toodles or some  collector of door-plates. Now I can understand why one might acquire a  taste for collecting book-plates of distinguished men or famous  book-collectors, just as one collects autographs; but why collect hundreds  and thousands of book-plates of undistinguished and even unknown persons,  frequently consisting of nothing more than family coats-of-arms, or mere  family names? I must confess that I share to a certain extent in Mr.  Lang's antipathy to this species of collecting, and am disposed to call  down on these collectors Shakespeare's curse on him who should move his  bones. But I cannot go with Mr. Lang when he calls these well-meaning and  by no means mischevious persons some hard names.    In some localities it is quite the vogue to take off the coffin-plate from  the coffin--all the other silver \"trimmings,\" too, for that matter--and  preserve it, and even have it framed and hung up in the home of the late  lamented. There may be a sense of proprietorship in the mourners, who have  bought and paid for it, and see no good reason for burying it, that will  justify this practice. At all events it is a family matter. The coffin  plate reminds the desolate survivors of the person designated, who is  shelved forever in the dust. But what would be said of the sense or sanity  of one who should go about collecting and framing coffin-plates,  cataloguing them, and even exchanging them?    Book-worms penetrate to different distances in books. Some go no further  than the title page; others dig into the preface or bore into the table of  contents; a few begin excavations at the close, to see \"how it comes out.\"  But that Worm is most easily satisfied who never goes beyond the inside of  the front cover, and passes his time in prying off the book-plates.    I think I have heard of persons who collect colophons. These go to work in  the reverse direction, and are even more reprehensible than the  accumulators of book-plates, because they inevitably ruin the book.    A book-plate is appropriate, sometimes ornamental, even beautiful, in its  intended place in the proprietor's book. Out of that, with rare  exceptions, it strikes one like the coffin-plate, framed and hanging on  the wall. It gives additional value and attractiveness to a book which  one buys, but it ought to remain there.    If one purchases books once owned by A, B and C--undistinguished persons,  or even distinguished--containing their autographs, he does not cut them  out to form a collection of autographs. If the name is not celebrated,  the autograph has no interest or value; if famous, it has still greater  interest and value by remaining in the book. So it seems to me it should  be in respect to book-plates. Let Mr. Astor's door-plate stay on his  front door, and let the energetic Mrs. Toodles content herself in buying  something less invididual and more adaptable.    A book-plate really is of no value except to the owner, as the man says of  papers which he has lost. It cannot be utilized to mark the possessions of  another. In this respect it is of inferior value to the door-plate, for  possibly another Mr. Astor might arise, to whom the orignal door-plate  might be sold. A Boston newspaper tells of a peddler of door-plates who  contracted to sell a Salem widow a door-plate; and when she gave him her  name to be engraved on it, gave only her surname, objecting to any first  name or initials, observing: \"I might get married again, and if my  initials or first name were on the plate, it would be of no use. If they  are left off, the plate could be used by my son.\"    Thus much about collecting book-plates. One word may be tolerated about  the character of one's own book-plate. To my taste, mere coats-of-arms  with mottoes are not the best form. They simply denote ownership. They  might well answer some further purpose, as for example to typify the  peculiar tastes of the proprietor in respect to his books. A portrait of  the owner is not objectionable, indeed is quite welcome in connection with  some device or motto pertaining to books and not to mere family descent.  But why, although a collector may have a favorite author, like Hawthorne  or Thackeray, for example, should he insert his portrait in his  book-plate, as is often done? Mr. Howells would writhe in his grave if he  knew that somebody had stuck Thackeray's portrait or Scott's in \"Silas  Lapham,\" and those Calvinists who think that the \"Scarlet Letter\" is  wicked, would pronounce damnation on the man who should put the gentle  Hawthorne's portrait in a religious book. To be sure, one might have a  variety of book-plates, with portraits appropriate to different kinds of  books--Napoleon's for military, Calvin for religious, Walton's for angling  and a composite portrait of Howells-James for fiction of the photographic  school; but this would involve expense and destroy the intrinsic unity  desirable in the book-plate. So let the portrait, if any, be either that  of the proprietor or a conventional image. If I were to relax and allow a  single exception it would be in favor of dear Charles Lamb's portrait in  \"Fraser's,\" representing him as reading a book by candle light. (For the  moment this idea pleases me so much that I feel half inclined to eat all  my foregoing words on this point, and adopt it for myself. At any rate, I  hereby preempt the privilege.)    I have referred to Mr. Lang's antipathy to book-plate collectors, and  while, as I have observed, he goes to extravagant lengths in condemning  their pursuit, still it may be of interest to my readers to know just  what he says about them, and so I reproduce below a ballad on the subject,  with (the material for) which he kindly supplied me when I solicited his  mild expression of opinion on the subject:      THE SNATCHERS.      The Romans snatched the Sabine wives;      The crime had some extenuation,    For they were leading lonely lives      And driven to reckless desperation.      Lord Elgin stripped the Grecian frieze      Of all its marbles celebrated,    So our art-students now with ease      Consult the figures overrated.      Napoleon stole the southern pictures      And hung them up to grace the Louvre;    And though he could not make them fixtures,      They answered as an art-improver.      Bold men ransack an Egyptian tomb,      And with the mummies there make free;    Such intermeddling with Time's womb      May aid in archeology.      So Cruncher dug up graves in haste,      To sell the corpses to the doctors;    This trade was not against his taste,      Though Misses \"flopped,\" and vowed it shocked hers.      The modern snatcher sponges leaves      And boards of books to crib their labels;    Most petty, trivial of thieves,      Surpassing all we read in fables.      He pastes them in a big, blank book      To show them to some rival fool,    And I pronounce him, when I look,      An almost idiotic ghoul.          X.    THE BOOK-AUCTIONEER.      There is one figure that stands in a very unpleasant relation to books.    If anybody has any curiosity to know what I consider the most undesirable  occupation of mankind, I will answer candidly--that of an auctioneer of  private libraries. It does not seem to have fallen into disrepute like  that of the headsman or hangman, and perhaps it is as unpleasantly  essential as that of the undertaker. But it generally thrives on the  unhappiness of those who are compelled to part with their books, on the  rivalries of the rich, and the strifes of the trade. It was urged  against Mr. Cleveland, on his first canvass for the"]]]
