Thus,  if I may be allowed a simile, the angler chooses not to see the fish he  angles for, until it is fairly caught.\" He meant of course--\"the _fish_  chooses not to see the _angler_, until it is fairly caught!\"    Be it known then to all, even the most aristocratic as to sexual  association--I say the most aristocratic, and not the most religious,  because religion is in some countries made the pander to aristocracy--be  it known that the critical judgment and pure taste for beauty are the sole  protection against low and degrading connexions.    Home observes that \"the sense of beauty does not tend to advance the  interests of society, but when in a due mean with respect to strength.  Love in particular arising from a sense of beauty, loses, when excessive,  its sociable character: the appetite for gratification, prevailing over  affection for the beloved object, is ungovernable, and tends violently to  its end, regardless of the misery that must follow. Love in this state is  no longer a sweet agreeable passion: it becomes painful, like hunger or  thirst, and produces no happiness but in the instant of fruition. This  discovery suggests a most important lesson, that moderation in our desires  and appetites, which fits us for doing our duty, contributes at the same  time the most to happiness: even social passions, when moderate, are more  pleasant than when they swell beyond proper bounds.\" Payne Knight says:  \"When, at the age of puberty, animal desire obtrudes itself on a mind  already qualified to feel and enjoy the charms of intellectual merit, the  imagination immediately begins to form pictures of perfection, by  exaggerating and combining in one hypothetic object every excellence that  can possibly belong to the whole sex; and the first individual that meets  the eye, with any exterior signs of any of these ideal excellences, is  immediately decorated with them all, by the creative magic of a vigorous  and fertile fancy. Hence, she instantaneously becomes the object of the  most fervent affection, which is as instantaneously cooled by possession:  for, as it was not the object herself, but a false idea of her raised in  heated imagination, that called forth all the lover's raptures, all  immediately vanish at the detection of his delusion; and a degree of  disgust proportioned to the disappointment, of which it is the inevitable  consequence, instantly succeeds. Thus it happens that what are called  love-matches are seldom or ever happy.\"    Now, nothing can more effectually prevent even the existence of the mania  described by these two philosophers than a critical judgment and a pure  taste for beauty, which again therefore are the sole protection against  low and degrading connexions.    A just sense of this truth will give high encouragement to sculpture and  painting--arts which may everywhere be looked upon as the best tests, as  well as the best records, of civilization. Such encouragement they need in  truth; for the monstrous monopoly of landed property and the accumulation  of wealth in few hands--the great aim of our political economy--renders  art poor, indeed.    I am aware that the vulgar among artists think otherwise; from the few  rich they obtain employment; and, like the dog with his master, they look  not beyond the hand that doles out their pittance. But the rich are few;  and their palaces are already filled. A diffusion of wealth alone can give  encouragement to art; nor can this ever be while British industry is  crushed under the weight of enormous taxation.    Having removed some objections to art, I would add a few words to artists  on the cause of the fine arts in Greece, from a paper I, two years ago,  contributed to a monthly periodical.[4]    That the mythology of Greece had an influence over its arts, is generally  granted; but I am not aware, that it has either been shown to be  exclusively their cause, or that its mode of operation has ever been  explained.    Religion, I may observe, is as natural to man as his weakness and  helplessness. There is not one of its systems, not even the vilest, which  has not afforded him consolation. Of its higher and better systems, some  are equally admirable for the grandeur and the beauty of the truths on  which they are founded, the simplicity and the elegance of their  ostensible forms, the power and applicability of their symbols, and their  sympathy with, and control over, the affections and the imagination.    These high characteristics peculiarly distinguished the religion of  ancient Greece.    By bigots, we are indeed told, that, though Homer is our model in epic,  Anacreon in lyric, and AEschylus in dramatic poetry--though the music of  Greece doubtless corresponded to its poetry in beauty, pathos, and  grandeur--though the mere wreck of her sculpture is never overlooked in  modern war and negotiation--though the mere sight of her ruined Parthenon  is more than a reward for the fatigue or the peril of a journey to the  Eternal city--though these products of art are the test of the highest  civilization which the world has witnessed--though to these chiefly Rome  owed the little civilization of which she was capable, and we ourselves  the circumstance that, at this hour, we are not, like our ancestors,  covered only with blue paint or the skins of brutes--though all this is  true as to the arts of Greece, we are told that, by the strangest  exception, the religion of Greece was a base superstition.    That religion, however, was the creator of these arts. They not only could  not have existed without it, but they probably could never have been  called into existence by any other religion.    The personification of _simple_ Beauty, Valor, Wisdom, or Omnipotence, in  Venus, Mars, Minerva, or Jupiter, respectively, was essential to the  _purity_ and the _power_ of expression of these attributes in the worship  of the deities to whom they respectively belonged. The union of absolute  beauty and valor in one being, is not more impossible than their union in  one expression of homage and admiration. Delicacy, elegance, and grace,  were as characteristic of the statue, the worship, and the temple, of the  goddess of beauty, as attributes nearly opposite to these were of the  statue, the worship, and the temple, of the god of war. Thus, were the  fine arts in Greece created by the personification of _simple_ attributes  or virtues as objects of adoration; and thus is excellence in these fine  arts incapable of being elicited by any system of religion in which more  than one attribute is ascribed to the god.    They must be ignorant, indeed, of the wonderful people of whom I now  speak, who allege, that the Greeks worshipped the mere statue of the god  and not the personified virtue. Even the history of their religion proves  the reverse. It was the tomb which became the altar, and retained nearly  its form. It was the expression of love, of regret, and of veneration for  departed virtue, which became divine adoration; and, as individual acts  and even individual names were ultimately lost in one transcendent  attribute, so were individual forms and features, in its purified and  ideal representation. Here, then, instead of finding the worship of men or  of their representations, we discover a gradual advance from beings to  attributes--from mortal man to eternal virtue--and a corresponding and  suitable advance from simple veneration to divine adoration.    When, in great emergencies of the state, the sages and the soldiers of  Athens, in solemn procession repaired to the temple of Minerva, turned  their faces toward the statue of the goddess, and prostrated themselves in  spirit before her--let the beautiful history of Grecian science tell,  whether in the statue they worshipped the mere marble structure, or, in  its forms and attributes, beheld and adored a personification of eternal  truth and wisdom, and so prepared the mind for deeds which have rendered  Greece for ever illustrious. Or, when returning from a Marathon, or a  Salamis, the warriors of Athens, followed by trains of maidens, and  matrons, and old men, returned thanks to the god of victories--let the  immortal record of the long series of glorious achievements which  succeeded these, tell, whether gratitude to their heroes was not there  identified with homage to the spirit or the divinity that inspired them.    True it is, that, whenever physical or moral principles are personified,  the ignorant may be led to mistake the sign for that which is signified;  but one of the most admirable characteristics of the Grecian religion is,  that, with little effort, every external form may be traced to the spirit  which it represents, and every fable may be resolved into a beautiful  illustration of physical or moral truth. So that when mystic influences,  with increasing knowledge, ceased to sway the imagination, all-powerful  truths directed the reason.    The natural and poetical religion of Greece, therefore, differed from  false and vulgar religions in this, that it was calculated to hold equal  empire over the minds of the ignorant and the wise; and the initiations of  Eleusis were apparently the solemn acts by which the youths and maidens of  Greece passed from ignorance and blind obedience to knowledge and  enlightened zeal. Thus, in that happy region, neither were the priests  knaves, nor the people their dupes.[5]    And what has been the result of this fundamental excellence?--that no  interpolated fooleries have been able to destroy it;--that the religion of  Greece exists, and must ever exist, the religion of nature, genius, and  taste;--and that neither poetry nor the arts can have being without it.  Schiller has well expressed this truth in the following lines:--      \"The intelligible forms of ancient poets,    The fair humanities of old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],[0,"A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#8)"],[1,".; head length, 10.7 mm.;  head length/snout-vent length, 30.1 per cent; head width, 10.6 mm.;  head width/snout-vent length, 29.8 per cent; diameter of eye, 3.6 mm.;  diameter of tympanum, 1.8 mm.; tympanum/eye, 50.0 per cent. Snout in  lateral profile square, not rounded above, and in dorsal profile  rounded with pointed tip resulting from vertical rostral keel; canthus  pronounced; loreal region barely concave; lips thick, rounded, and  barely flaring; nostrils protuberant; internarial distance, 3.2 mm.;  top of head flat; interorbital distance, 3.8 mm., and approximately a  fifth broader than width of eyelid, 3.2 mm. A moderately heavy dermal  fold from posterior corner of eye above tympanum and curving ventrad  to anterior edge of insertion of forelimb, covering upper edge of  tympanum; tympanum round, its diameter equal to its distance from eye.  Forearm moderately robust, having distinct dermal fold on wrist; row  of small, low, rounded tubercles along ventrolateral surface of  forearm; pollex only slightly enlarged, bearing triangular patch of  small horn-covered spines (56 on right, 62 on left); second finger  noticeably shorter than fourth; subarticular tubercles round, distal  ones on third and fourth toes bifid; discs moderate in size, that of  third finger slightly larger than diameter of tympanum; no web between  first and second fingers; other fingers one-third webbed.

Anal  opening near dorsal surface of thighs; short anal flap; opening  bordered laterally by heavy dermal fold and ventrolaterally by large  tubercles. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of forelimbs and shanks  smooth; that of throat, belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs  granular. Ventrolateral glands moderately developed, reaching axilla  but not to groin and broadly separated midventrally. Tongue cordiform,  shallowly notched behind and barely free posteriorly; vomerine teeth  4-3, situated on transverse elevations between ovoid inner nares;  openings to vocal sac large, one situated along inner posterior edge  of each mandibular ramus.    Dorsal ground-color of head, body, and limbs pale tan with large  interconnected dark brown blotches on head and body and broad dark  brown transverse bands on limbs; dorsal surfaces of first and second  fingers and of webbing of hands pale brown; dorsal surfaces of third  and fourth fingers dark brown; anterior surfaces of thighs  flesh-color; posterior surfaces of thighs brown; dorsal surfaces of  tarsi and feet dark brown; narrow white stripe along ventrolateral  edges of forearms and tarsi; a faint creamy white stripe above anal  opening; axilla white; flanks creamy white, boldly spotted with black;  throat and chest white; ventral surfaces of tarsi and feet dark brown;  other ventral surfaces dusty cream color; large brown spots on chin  and anterior part of abdomen.    In life the dorsum was reddish brown (Orange-Cinnamon) with dark brown  (Chocolate) blotches; first and second fingers and webbing on hand  pale reddish brown (Cinnamon); webbing on feet dark brown (Clove  Brown); flanks pale creamy white (Pale Olive Buff) with dark brown  (Bone Brown) spots; iris reddish bronze (Apricot Orange).    _Variation._--No noticeable geographic variation is apparent in the  few available specimens; variations in proportions are given in Table  1. The distal subarticular tubercle of the fourth finger is either  bifid or double in all specimens; that on the third finger usually is  bifid, sometimes single. The vertical rostral keel is prominent in all  freshly preserved specimens; in some older specimens it is indistinct.  The tongue always is notched posteriorly; in some individuals the  notch is shallow; in others it is deep.    Some specimens are paler and less boldly marked than the specimen  described above. All specimens from Agua del Obispo and some specimens  from the northern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental in Oaxaca have a  pale tan dorsum with brown markings. In most individuals the white  color in the axilla extends onto the posterior edge of the upper arm.  The creamy white color of the flanks is constant and usually extends  slightly dorsad in the inguinal region. The white stripe above, and  sometimes continuing down beside, the anal opening varies from a thin  indistinct line or row of flecks to a distinct continuous stripe. Two  specimens have dark brown spots on the belly; in the others the spots  are confined to the flanks and throat.    _Description of tadpole._--The following description is based on KU  68556 from 7.5 kilometers south of Yetla, Oaxaca, Mexico (Figs. 4C and  6C). No limb buds; total length, 37.3 mm.; body length, 12.2 mm.; body  length/total length, 32.7 per cent; body slightly depressed, barely  wider than deep, ovoid in dorsal profile; mouth directed ventrally;  eyes small, directed dorsolaterally; nostrils barely protuberant and  directed anterolaterally, about midway between snout and eye; spiracle  sinistral and posteroventrad to eye; anal tube dextral. Caudal fin  low, bluntly rounded posteriorly; greatest depth of caudal musculature  about one-half depth of caudal fin; musculature extends nearly to tip  of tail.    Mouth large; lips having deep lateral folds; two complete rows of  papillae on lips; five to seven rows of papillae laterally; beaks  moderately developed, bearing short peglike serrations; moderately  wide lateral projections on upper beak; tooth-rows 4/6; upper rows  subequal in length; fourth row interrupted medially; length of lower  rows 1-4 equal to upper rows; fifth and sixth lower rows shorter;  first lower row interrupted medially.    Body brown above; tip of snout brown; venter creamy gray; caudal  musculature creamy tan; caudal fin transparent; cream-colored  crescent-shaped mark on posterior edge of body; dark brown flecks on  caudal musculature and all except anterior two-thirds of ventral  caudal fin; large brown square blotches on dorsum of caudal fin; eye  reddish brown in life.    _Variation._--The variation in size and proportions is given in Table  2. With the exception of one specimen having a short, broken, seventh  tooth-row, all specimens have 4/6 tooth-rows that are like those  described above. In some specimens the brown blotches on the dorsum of  the caudal musculature are fused and marked with cream-colored flecks.    _Comparisons._--_Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_ differs from all other  members of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group in having a square  snout, and further differs from _P. spinipollex_ in more numerous and  smaller nuptial spines and in transverse, instead of posteromedially  slanting, vomerine processes between the inner nares. _Ptychohyla  leonhardschultzei_ differs from _P. euthysanota_ in having a rostral  keel and in having white flanks boldly spotted with black.    All small hylids that are sympatric with _Ptychohyla  leonhardschultzei_ are either yellow (_Hyla dendroscarta_ and _H.  melanomma_) or green (_Hyla erythromma_, which has a red eye, _Hyla  hazelae_, which has a black line on the canthus, and _Ptychohyla  ignicolor_, which has red flash colors on the thighs).    _Life History._--This frog has been found along streams in cloud  forests and in pine-oak forest. Males call from vegetation along the  stream or from rocks in and at the edge of the stream. The call is a  single, long, soft \"wraack,\" repeated at intervals of anywhere from  several seconds to three or four minutes. Each note has a duration of  0.62 to 0.95 of a second and a rate of 76 to 78 pulses per second; the  dominant frequency falls between 2700 and 2800 cycles per second  (Pl. 11C).    Tadpoles were found in several streams in northern Oaxaca. A tadpole  having a total length of 21.1 mm. has three upper and four lower  tooth-rows well developed; the fourth upper and fifth lower rows are  weakly present, and the sixth lower row has not started to develop.  Two metamorphosed young have snout-vent lengths of 15.2 and 15.5 mm.    _Remarks._--Four specific names have been applied to this species. Ahl  (1934:185) based his description of _Hyla leonhardschultzei_ on a  small, poorly preserved female. Taylor (1944:41) proposed the generic  name _Ptychohyla_ for a species (named therein as _P. adipoventris_)  of hylid having ventrolateral glands and horn-covered nuptial spines.  Obviously, Taylor was unaware that _Hyla leonhardschultzei_ was the  same species. Earlier Taylor (1937:46) described _Hyla pinorum_. The  types of all of these species came from the Pacific slopes of the  Sierra del Sur in Guerrero. Examination of the types and other  available specimens shows that they are representatives of a single  species. The type of _Hyla pinorum_ is an immature male having a  snout-vent length of 26.7 mm. All of these specimens have the square  snout and black and white flanks characteristic of _Ptychohyla  leonhard-schultzei_. Although Shannon (1951:473) based his description  of _Hyla milleri_ on a male having well-developed ventrolateral  glands, he overlooked the presence of these glands in his description  and discussion of relationships. The acquisition of more specimens  from northern Oaxaca has shown that _Hyla milleri_ is the same as  _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_.    _Distribution._--This species is known from pine-oak forest and cloud  forest on the Pacific slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur in Guerrero "]]]
