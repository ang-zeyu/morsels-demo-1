For       the which causes, We, as Gonfaloniere and Captain of his       Holiness and the aforesaid See, exhort, recommend, and       command you, on receipt hereof, to free yourselves from       all other yoke, and to send ambassadors to lay before his       Holiness your dutiful and unreserved obedience: which       failing, we are commanded to reduce you by force to that       duty,--an event that would distress us on account of the       serious injuries which must thereby result to your people,       for whom we have, from our boyhood, borne and still bear       singular favour. From Corinaldo, the 2d of January, 1503.         \"CESARE BORGIA OF FRANCE, DUKE OF ROMAGNA AND       VALENTINO, PRINCE OF ADRIA AND VENAFRA, LORD OF       PIOMBINO, Gonfaloniere and Captain-General of the Holy       Roman Church.\"    News of the Sinigaglia tragedy reached the Pope late in the evening,  and he instantly communicated to Cardinal Orsini that Cesare had  taken that city, assured that an early visit of congratulation from  his Eminence would follow. The Cardinal was perhaps the richest and  most influential of his house. He chiefly had organised the league  of La Magione, but having always contrived to keep on good terms  with Alexander, he believed in the professions of regard with which  his Holiness subsequently seduced him from that policy, and thence  reposed in him a fatal confidence. Next morning he rode in state to  pay his respects at the Vatican, where his own person and those of  his principal relations were instantly seized, whilst his magnificent  palace at Monte Giordano was pillaged by orders and for the benefit  of the Pontiff. After an imprisonment of some weeks, he was cut off  by slow poison, prescribed from the same quarter, and died on the 22d  of February. Thus did the Pope set his seal of approval on his son's  atrocities, which he justified by a poor and pointless jest, avowing  that as the confederates of La Magione, after stipulating that they  should not be required to re-enter the service of Valentino unless  singly, had thought fit to place themselves within his power _en  masse_, they merited their fate as forsworn.    [Illustration: FACSIMILE OF SIGNATURES    [1. 1480]    [2. 1494]    [3. 1501]    [4. 1504]    [5. 1501]    [6. 1510]    [7. 1522]    [8. 1540]    [9. 1517]]    The massacre of Sinigaglia has been condemned by every writer except  Machiavelli, and posterity has in severe retribution suspected him  of abetting it. This charge possesses a twofold interest, as  inculpating the character of the historian, and as affecting the  morality of the age.[*3] In the latter view alone does it fall under  our consideration: yet however horrible these wholesale murders, they  are more remarkable in Italian history as the crowning crime of an  ambitious career, and as widely influencing the political aspect of  Romagna and La Marca, than from their relative enormity. The fates  of the young Astorre Manfredi of Faenza, of Fogliano of Fermo, of  the Lord of Camerino and his three sons, have all been mentioned in  these pages as occurring within a year or two of this event. It would  be easy to swell the catalogue of slaughter; and we find Baglioni  and Vitellozzo both classed with Cesare himself in the category  of murder, by a chronicler of Alexander VI., who also quotes from  the mouth of Giovanni Bentivoglio, at the diet of La Magione, this  bravado, \"I shall assassinate Duke Valentino should I be so lucky as  to have opportunity.\"[4] The spirit of the age is further illustrated  by its unnumbered poisonings: and the fact that Machiavelli should  neither have used his influence with Valentino to avert the massacre  of the confederates, nor his pen to brand the treachery of that foul  deed, is but another link in the evidence from which we may deduce  the total extinction of moral feeling, which, anticipating the worst  doctrines of Loyola, carried them out with a selfishness, falsehood,  and cruelty unparalleled in the annals of human civilisation.[*5]    [Footnote *3: It is unlikely that Machiavelli abetted the massacre,  though he certainly approved it dispassionately enough. By it the  Papacy was rid at last of the houses of Colonna and Orsini. Cesare  met Machiavelli after the affair \"with the best cheer in the world,\"  reminding him that he had given him a hint of his intentions, but  adding, \"I did not tell you all.\" He urged on Machiavelli his  desire for a firm alliance with Florence. Cf. MACHIAVELLI,  _Legazione al Valentino_, Lett. 86, and the _Modo tenuto dal Duca  Valentino nel ammazzare Vitellozzo_. See also CREIGHTON,  _op. cit._, vol V., p. 40.]    [Footnote 4: VERMIGLIOLI: _Vita di Malatesta Baglioni_.]    [Footnote *5: The schemes of Cesare were in his age no more  unscrupulously carried out than Bismarck's in his. \"It is well,\" said  Cesare, \"to beguile those who have shown themselves to be masters of  treachery.\"]    [Illustration: _Alinari_    IL CASTELLO DI SINIGAGLIA]    Gianpaolo Baglioni having fled to Siena, Valentino followed him in  that direction, after taking possession of Perugia, and learning  that Citta di Castello, abandoned by the adherents of the Vitelli,  had been plundered by his own partizans. On the 18th of January,  hearing at Citta della Pieve of the blow struck by his father against  the Orsini, and that Fabio, who escaped the snare at Sinigaglia,  was ravaging the Campagna, he handed over Paolo and the Duke of  Gravina to the tender mercies of Michelotto, whose noose quickly  encircled their necks. Invading the Sienese, he carried fire and  sword by Chiusi as far as Pienza and San Quirico, massacring even  the aged and infirm with horrible tortures. His real object, besides  revenging himself upon Petrucci and Baglioni, was to add Siena to his  territory, but his position being then a delicate one with France, he  accepted the proposal of that republic to purchase safety, by exiling  Petrucci their seigneur, and dismissing Baglioni their guest.[*6]    [Footnote *6: Cf. LISINI, _Cesare Borgia e la repubblica di  Siena_, in the _Boll. Senese di Stor. Pat._, ann. VII. (fasc. I.),  pp. 114, 115, and 144 _et seq._ for all the documents. And for a  short but excellent account in English of the whole Sienese affair,  LANGTON DOUGLAS, _A History of Siena_ (Murray, 1902), p. 206  _et seq._]    This series of rapid successes is ascribed by Machiavelli to the  policy of Valentino in ridding himself of his French auxiliaries and  his mercenary confederates, and so being enabled, during the brief  remainder of his career, to give his talents and energy full scope in  the conduct of an army entirely devoted to his views. His conquests  had now extended along the eastern fall of the Apennines, from  Imola to Camerino, and included the upper vale of the Tiber and the  principality of Piombino. He had but to add to them Siena, and the  best part of Central Italy from sea to sea would be his own. The eyes  of Louis, at length opened to a danger which he had so long fostered,  were not blinded by Cesare's affected moderation in claiming his  recent acquisitions rather for the Church than for himself, and that  monarch hastened to caution him from further hostilities against  Tuscany. The successes of Fabio Orsini around Rome at the same time  called for his presence, so he changed his route to make a foray  upon the holdings of that family about the Lake of Bracciano, with  whom the Colonna and Savelli had united against their common enemies  the Borgia. This opportunity was greedily seized by the Pontiff to  carry out his long cherished policy of breaking the power of the  great barons, and the castles of the Orsini having one after another  been reduced, their influence ceased for the future to be formidable  either to their sovereign or their neighbours.           *       *       *       *       *    But it is time we should return to Urbino, where we left the  citizens bewailing the departure of their Duke. As soon as he was  gone, Antonio di S. Savino took possession of the place in name of  Valentino, and issued a proclamation enjoining the townsfolk to  disarm, the peasantry to return home, and all to surrender whatever  they had stolen the day before from the palace. In the afternoon,  after a conciliatory harangue to the people, he took his lodging  in the palace. Next morning, after mass, the Bishop published a  general amnesty, and oaths of allegiance to the new sovereign were  administered. Towards evening the bells were rung, and a bonfire was  lit in the piazza; but these were heartless and forced rejoicings,  and no bribes could induce even the children to raise the cry of  \"Valenza.\" Nor was this sadness without cause, for the soldiery of  Orsini and Vitellozzo, who still quartered in the town, treated all  with such outrage, that many of the inhabitants prayed for death  to close their sufferings, envying those who were summoned from  such scenes of misery. But when the troops were withdrawn, the mild  character and popular manners of Antonio the governor, skilfully  seconding the conciliatory policy which Borgia had resolved upon,  gave matters another aspect, and occasioned surprise to those who  knew the cruel perfidy of their new master. Various notorious abuses  were put down under severe penalties, especially the acceptance  of presents by judges, and the following up of private vengeance.  The deputy governor, Giovanni da Forli, was however a man of quite  opposite temperament, whose harshness soon counteracted these gentler  influences, and occasioned general disgust. But the people heard  with satisfaction the tragedy of Sinigaglia; for to the perfidy  of the chiefs and the brutality of their army, the loss of their  independence and the whole of their late misfortunes were unanimously  ascribed; and a permission to ravage the territory of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/443"],[0,"The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac (#8)"],[1," but myself!     And yet I have a strapping boy        Who (I have every cause to know)     Would to its full extent enjoy        The friendship of Boccaccio!       But boys are, oh! so different now        From what they were when I was one!     I fear my boy would not know how        To take that old raconteur's fun!     In your companionship, O friend,        I think it wise alone to go     Plucking the gracious fruits that bend        Wheree'er you lead, Boccaccio.       So rest you there upon the shelf,        Clad in your garb of faded brown;     Perhaps, sometime, my boy himself        Shall find you out and take you down.     Then may he feel the joy once more        That thrilled me, filled me years ago     When reverently I brooded o'er        The glories of Boccaccio!      Out upon the vile brood of imitators, I say!  Get ye gone, ye Bandellos  and ye Straparolas and ye other charlatans who would fain possess  yourselves of the empire which the genius of Boccaccio bequeathed to  humanity.  There is but one master, and to him we render grateful  homage.  He leads us down through the cloisters of time, and at his  touch the dead become reanimate, and all the sweetness and the valor of  antiquity recur; heroism, love, sacrifice, tears,  laughter, wisdom,  wit, philosophy, charity, and understanding are his auxiliaries;  humanity is his inspiration, humanity his theme, humanity his audience,  humanity his debtor.    Now it is of Tancred's daughter he tells, and now of Rossiglione's  wife; anon of the cozening gardener he speaks and anon of Alibech; of  what befell Gillette de Narbonne, of Iphigenia and Cymon, of Saladin,  of Calandrino, of Dianora and Ansaldo we hear; and what subject soever  he touches he quickens it into life, and he so subtly invests it with  that indefinable quality of his genius as to attract thereunto not only  our sympathies but also our enthusiasm.    Yes, truly, he should be read with understanding; what author should  not?  I would no more think of putting my Boccaccio into the hands of a  dullard than I would think of leaving a bright and beautiful woman at  the mercy of a blind mute.    I have hinted at the horror of the fate which befell Yseult Hardynge in  the seclusion of Mr. Henry Boggs's Lincolnshire estate.  Mr. Henry  Boggs knew nothing of romance, and he cared less; he was wholly  incapable of appreciating a woman with dark, glorious eyes and an  expanding soul; I'll warrant me that he would at any time gladly have  traded a \"Decameron\" for a copy of \"The Gentleman Poulterer,\" or for a  year's subscription to that grewsome monument to human imbecility,  London \"Punch.\"    Ah, Yseult! hadst thou but been a book!        VII    THE DELIGHTS OF FENDER-FISHING    I should like to have met Izaak Walton.  He is one of the few authors  whom I know I should like to have met.  For he was a wise man, and he  had understanding.  I should like to have gone angling with him, for I  doubt not that like myself he was more of an angler theoretically than  practically.  My bookseller is a famous fisherman, as, indeed,  booksellers generally are, since the methods employed by fishermen to  deceive and to catch their finny prey are very similar to those  employed by booksellers to attract and to entrap buyers.    As for myself, I regard angling as one of the best of avocations, and  although I have pursued it but little, I concede that doubtless had I  practised it oftener I should have been a better man.  How truly has  Dame  Juliana Berners said that \"at the least the angler hath his  wholesome walk and merry at his ease, and a sweet air of the sweet  savour of the mead flowers that maketh him hungry; he heareth the  melodious harmony of fowls; he seeth the young swans, herons, ducks,  cotes, and many other fowls with their broods, which meseemeth better  than all the noise of hounds, the blasts of horns, and the cry of fowls  that hunters, falconers, and fowlers can make.  And IF the angler take  fish--surely then is there no man merrier than he is in his spirit!\"    My bookseller cannot understand how it is that, being so enthusiastic a  fisherman theoretically, I should at the same time indulge so seldom in  the practice of fishing, as if, forsooth, a man should be expected to  engage continually and actively in every art and practice of which he  may happen to approve.  My young friend Edward Ayer has a noble  collection of books relating to the history of American aboriginals and  to the wars waged between those Indians and the settlers in this  country; my other young friend Luther Mills has gathered together a  multitude of books treating of the Napoleonic wars; yet neither Ayer  nor Mills hath ever slain a man or fought a battle, albeit both find  delectation in recitals of warlike prowess and personal valor.  I love  the night and all the poetic influences of that quiet time, but I do  not sit up all night in order to hear the nightingale or to contemplate  the astounding glories of the heavens.    For similar reasons, much as I appreciate and marvel at the beauties of  early morning, I do not make a practice of early rising, and sensible  as I am to the charms of the babbling brook and of the crystal lake, I  am not addicted to the practice of wading about in either to the danger  either to my own health or to the health of the finny denizens in those  places.    The best anglers in the world are those who do not catch fish; the mere  slaughter of fish is simply brutal, and it was with a view to keeping  her excellent treatise out of the hands of the idle and the  inappreciative that Dame Berners incorporated that treatise in a  compendious book whose cost was so large that only \"gentyll and noble  men\"  could possess it.  What mind has he who loveth fishing merely for  the killing it involves--what mind has such a one to the beauty of the  ever-changing panorama which nature unfolds to the appreciative eye, or  what communion has he with those sweet and uplifting influences in  which the meadows, the hillsides, the glades, the dells, the forests,  and the marshes abound?    Out upon these vandals, I say--out upon the barbarians who would rob  angling of its poesy, and reduce it to the level of the butcher's  trade!  It becomes a base and vicious avocation, does angling, when it  ceases to be what Sir Henry Wotton loved to call it--\"an employment for  his idle time, which was then not idly spent; a rest to his mind, a  cheerer of his spirits, a diverter of sadness, a calmer of unquiet  thoughts, a moderator of passions, a procurer of contentedness, and a  begetter of habits of peace and patience in those that professed and  practised it!\"    There was another man I should like to have met--Sir Henry Wotton; for  he was an ideal angler.  Christopher North, too (\"an excellent angler  and now with God\"!)--how I should love to have explored the Yarrow with  him, for he was a man of vast soul, vast learning, and vast wit.    \"Would you believe it, my dear Shepherd,\" said he, \"that my piscatory  passions are almost dead within me, and I like now to saunter along the  banks and braes, eying the younkers angling, or to lay me down on some  sunny spot, and with my face up to heaven, watch the slow-changing  clouds!\"    THERE was the angling genius with whom I would fain go angling!    \"Angling,\" says our revered St. Izaak, \"angling is somewhat like  poetry--men are to be born so.\"    Doubtless there are poets who are not anglers, but doubtless there  never was an angler who was not also a poet.  Christopher North was a  famous fisherman; he began his career as such when he was a child of  three years.  With his thread line and bent-pin hook the wee tot set  out to make his first cast in \"a wee burnie\" he had discovered near his  home.  He caught his fish, too, and for the rest of the day he carried  the miserable little specimen about on a  plate, exhibiting it  triumphantly.  With that first experience began a life which I am fain  to regard as one glorious song in praise of the beauty and the  beneficence of nature.    My bookseller once took me angling with him in a Wisconsin lake which  was the property of a club of anglers to which my friend belonged.  As  we were to be absent several days I carried along a box of books, for I  esteem appropriate reading to be a most important adjunct to an angling  expedition.  My bookseller had with him enough machinery to stock a  whaling expedition, and I could not help wondering what my old Walton  would think, could he drop down into our company with his modest  equipment of hooks, flies, and gentles.    The lake whither we went was a large and beautiful expanse, girt by a  landscape which to my fancy was the embodiment of poetic delicacy and  suggestion.  I began to inquire about the chub, dace, and trouts, but  my bookseller lost no time in telling me that the lake had been rid of  all cheap fry, and had been stocked with game fish, such as bass and  pike.    I did not at all relish this covert sneer at traditions which I have  always reverenced, and the better acquainted I became with my  bookseller's modern art of angling the less I liked it.  I have little  love for that kind of angling which does not admit of a simultaneous  enjoyment of the surrounding beauties of nature. My bookseller enjoined  silence upon me, but I did not heed the injunction, for I must, indeed,  have been a mere wooden effigy to hold my peace amid that picturesque  environment of hill, valley, wood, meadow, and arching sky of clear  blue.    It was fortunate for me that I had my \"Noctes Ambrosianae\" along, for  when I had exhausted my praise of the surrounding glories of nature, my  bookseller would not converse with me; so I opened my book and read to  him that famous passage between Kit North and the Ettrick Shepherd,  wherein the shepherd discourses boastfully of his prowess as a piscator  of sawmon.
