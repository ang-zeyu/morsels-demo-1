This yard was surrounded by a board fence that  could be easily surmounted. I intended to take the lead, after taking  off my irons (which I had learned to do, and indeed, did every day,  putting them on only when I was liable to be \"inspected\") and after  leaving these irons at the Deputy's door, I intended to put myself on  the Jersey side of the river as speedily as possible.    Liberty was within reach of every man in that room, and the night was  set for the escape. But one of the crowd turned traitor, and, under  pretence, of speaking to the Deputy about some matter, managed to be  called out of the room and disclosed the whole. The man was waiting  transportation to prison to serve out a sentence of ten years, and,  with the chance of escape before him, it seemed singular that he should  reveal a plan which promised to give him liberty; but probably he  feared a failure; or that he might be recaptured and his prison sentence  increased; while on the other hand by disclosing the plot he could  curry favor enough to get his term reduced, and perhaps he might gain a  pardon. Any how, he betrayed us. The Deputy came in and found the stone  in the condition described, and forthwith we were all removed to the  dungeon, or dark room, and kept there on bread and water for twelve  days. We heard afterwards that our betrayer did get five years less than  his original sentence for subjecting his comrades in misery to twelve  days of almost indescribable suffering. We were not only in a totally  dark and frightfully filthy hole, but we were half starved, and the  Deputy daily took delight in taunting us with our sufferings.    At the end of the twelve days we were taken back to the old room where  we found the stone securely fastened in with irons. Moreover, we were  now under stricter observation, and at stated hours every day, an  inspector came in and examined the walls. This soon wore off, however,  and when the inspection was finally abandoned, about two months from the  time of our first attempt, we managed to find another place in the old  wall where we could dig out and we went to work. We were a fortnight at  it, and had nearly completed our labor when we were discovered.    This time we spent fourteen days in the dungeon for our pains.    And now comes an extraordinary disclosure with regard to my  imprisonment. A few days after my removal from the dungeon to the old  quarters again, the Deputy, in one of his rare periods of what, with  him, passed for good humor, informed me that Sarah had been confined,  and had given birth to a fine boy; that she was crying for my release;  that Lawyer Sitgreave was interceding for me; but that the old man  Scheimer was still obstinate and would not let me out. Passing over  my feelings with regard to the birth of my son, here was a revelation  indeed! It will be remembered that I had only been told that I was under  indictment for bigamy. I had never been brought before a justice for  a preliminary examination; never bound over for trial; and now it  transpired that old Scheimer, a Pennsylvania Dutch farmer, had the  power to put me in jail, put me in irons, and subject me to long months,  perhaps years of imprisonment. I had something to occupy my thoughts  now, and for the remaining period of my jail life.    Next came a new dodge of the Scheimers, the object of which was to show  that Sarah's marriage to me was no marriage at all, thus leaving her  free to marry any other man her family might force upon her. When I had  been in jail seven months, one day the Deputy came in and said that he  was going to take off my irons. I told him I wouldn't trouble him to  do that, for though I had worn them when he and his subordinates were  around till the irons had nearly killed me, yet at other times I had  been in a habit of taking them off at pleasure; and to prove it, I sat  down and in a few minutes handed him the irons. The man was amazed; but  saying nothing about the irons, he approached me on another subject. He  said he thought if I would sign an acknowledgment that I was a married  man when I married Sarah Scheimer, and would leave the State forever, I  could get out of jail; would I do it? I told him I would give no answer  till I had seen my counsel.    Well, the next day Lawyer Sitgreave came to me and told me I had better  do it, and I consented. Shortly afterwards, I was taken to court, for  the first time in this whole affair, and was informed by the judge that  if I would sign a bond not to go near the Scheimer house or family he  would discharge me. I signed such a bond, and the judge then told me I  was discharged; but that I ought to have gone to State prison for ten  years for destroying the peace and happiness of the Scheimer family.  Truly the Scheimer family were a power, indeed, in that part of the  country!    My lawyer gave me five dollars and I went to Harmony and staid that  night. The next day I went to an old friend of mine, a Methodist  minister, and persuaded him to go over and see what Sarah Scheimer's  feelings were towards me, and if she was willing to come to me with our  child. He went over there, but the old Scheimers suspected his errand,  and watched him closely to see that he held no communication with Sarah.  He did, however, have an opportunity to speak to her, and she sent me  word that if she could ever get her money and get away from her parents,  she would certainly join me in any part of the world. I was warned, at  the same time, not to come near the house, for fear that her father or  some of her brothers would kill me.        CHAPTER VI. FREE LIFE AND FISHING.    TAKING CARE OF CRAZY MEN--CARRYING OFF A BOY--ARRESTED FOR STEALING MY  OWN HORSE AND BUGGY--FISHING IN LAKE WINNIPISEOGEE--AN ODD LANDLORD--A  WOMAN AS BIG AS A HOGSHEAD--REDUCING THE HOGSHEAD TO A BARREL--WONDERFUL  VERIFICATION OF A DREAM--SUCCESSFUL MEDICAL PRACTICE--A BUSY WINTER  IN NEW HAMPSHIRE--BLANDISHMENTS OF CAPTAIN BROWN--I GO TO NEWARK, NEW  JERSEY.        The next day I left Harmony and walked to Port Jarvis, on the Erie  Railroad, N. Y., arriving late at night, and entirely footsore, sick,  and disheartened. I went to the hotel, and the next morning I found  myself seriously sick. Asking advice, I was directed to the house of  a widow, who promised to nurse and take care of me. I was ill for two  weeks, and meantime, my half-sister in Delaware County, to whom I  made known my condition, sent me money for my expenses, and when I  had sufficiently recovered to travel, I went to this sister's house in  Sidney, and there I remained several days, till I was quite well and  strong again.    Casting about for something to do, a friend told me that he knew of  an opportunity for a good man at Newbury to take care of a young man,  eighteen years of age, who was insane. I went there and saw his father,  and he put him under my charge. I had the care of him four months, and  during the last two months of the time I traveled about with him,  and returned him, finally, to his friends in a materially improved  condition. The friends of another insane man in Montgomery, near  Newbury, hearing of my success with this young man, sent for me to come  and see them. I went there and found a man who had been insane seven  years, but who was quiet and well-behaved, only he was \"out of his  head.\" I engaged to do what I could for him. The father of my Newbury  patient had paid me well, and with my medical practice and the sale of  medicines in traveling about, I had accumulated several hundred dollars,  and when I went to Montgomery I had a good horse and buggy which cost me  five hundred dollars. So, when my new patient had been under my care and  control two months, I proposed that he should travel about with me in my  buggy, and visit various parts of the State in the immediate vicinity.  His friends thought well of the suggestion, and we traveled in this way  about four months, stopping a few days here and there, when I practiced  where I could, and sold medicines, making some money. At the end of  this time I went back to Montgomery with my patient, as I think, fully  restored, and his father, besides, paying the actual expenses of our  journey, gave me six hundred dollars.    Returning to Sidney I learned that my first and worst wife was then  living with the children at Unadilla, a few miles across the river in  Otsego County. I had no desire to see her, but I heard at the same time  that my youngest boy, a lad ten years old, had been sent to work on a  farm three miles beyond, and that he was not well taken care of. I drove  over to see about it, and after some inquiry I was told that the boy  was then in school. Going to the schoolhouse and asking for him, the  school-mistress, who knew me, denied that he was there, but I pushed  in, and found him, and a ragged, miserable looking little wretch he was.  I brought him out, put him into the carriage and took him with me on the  journey which I was then contemplating to Amsterdam, N. Y., stopping  at the first town to get him decently clothed. The boy went with me  willingly, indeed he was glad to go, and in due time we arrived at  Amsterdam, and from there we went to Troy.    I had not been in Troy two hours before I was arrested for stealing my  own horse and buggy! My turnout was taken from me, and I found myself in  durance vile. I was not long in procuring bail, and I then set myself,  to work to find out what this meant. I was shown a handbill describing  my person, giving my name, giving a description of my horse, and  offering a reward of fifty dollars for my arrest. This was signed by  a certain Benson, of Kingston, Sullivan County, N.Y. I then remembered  that while I was traveling with my insane patient from Montgomery  through Sullivan County, I fell in with a Benson who was a very  plausible fellow, and who scraped acquaintance with me, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4671"],[0,"The Story of the Pony Express (#8)"],[1,"but  who opposed war. Many of these \"knights\" were prosperous and substantial  citizens who, working under the guise of their local respectability,  exerted a profound influence. Here then, at the outset, was a vigorous  and not a small minority, whose influence was greatly out of proportion  to their numbers because of their zeal; and who would have seized the  balance of power unless held in check by an aroused Union sentiment and  military intimidation.    Another class of men to be feared was a small but powerful group  representing much wealth, a financial class which proverbially shuns war  because of the expense which war involves; a class that always insists  upon peace, even at the cost of compromised honor. These men, with the  influence which their money commanded, would inevitably espouse the side  that seemed the most likely of speedy success; and in view of the early  successes of the Confederate armies and the zealous proselytizing of  rebel sympathizers in their midst they were a potential risk to loyal  California.    The native Spanish or Mexican classes then numerically strong in that  state, were appealed to by the anti-Unionists from various cunning  approaches, chief of which was the theory that the many real estate  troubles and complicated land titles by which they had been annoyed  since the separation from Old Mexico in 1847, would be promptly adjusted  under Confederate authority. While nearly all these natives were  ignorant, many held considerable property and they in turn influenced  their poorer brethren. Chimerical as this argument may sound, it had  much weight.    Another group of persons also large potentially and a serious menace  when proselyted by the apostles of rebellion, were the squatters and  trespassers who were occupying land to which they had no lawful right.  Many of these men were reckless; some had already been entangled in the  courts because of their false land claims. Hence their attitude toward  the existing Government was ugly and defiant. Yet they were now assured  that they might remain on their lands forever undisturbed, under a rebel  regime.    Added to all these sources of danger was the attitude of the thousands  of well-meaning people--who, regardless of rebel solicitation, were at  first indifferent. They thought that the great distance which separated  them from the seat of war made it a matter of but little importance  whether California aroused herself or not. They were of course  counseling neutrality as the easiest way of avoiding trouble.    Turning now to the forces, moral, military, and political, that were  working to save California--first there was a loyal newspaper press,  which saw and followed its duty with unflinching devotion. It firmly  held before the people the loyal responsibility of the state and  declared that the ties of union were too sacred to be broken. It was the  moral duty of the people to remain loyal. It truthfully asserted that  California's influence in the Federal Union should be an example for  other states to follow. If the idea of a Pacific Republic were  repudiated by their own citizens, such action would discourage secession  elsewhere and be a great moral handicap to that movement. And the press  further pointed out with convincing clearness, that should the Union be  dissolved, the project for a Pacific Railroad[19] with which the future  of the Commonwealth was inevitably committed, would likely fail.    Aroused by the moral importance of its position, the state legislature,  early in the winter of 1860-1861, had passed a resolution of fidelity to  the Union, in which it declared \"That California is ready to maintain  the rights and honor of the National Government at home and abroad, and  at all times to respond to any requisitions that may be made upon her to  defend the Republic against foreign or domestic foes.\" Succeeding events  proved the genuineness of this resolve.    In the early spring of 1861, the War Department sent General Edwin A.  Sumner to take command of the Military Department of the Pacific with  headquarters at San Francisco, supplanting General Albert Sidney  Johnston who resigned to fight for the South. This was a most fortunate  appointment, as Sumner proved a resourceful and capable official,  ideally suited to meet the crisis before him. Nor does this reflect in  any way upon the superb soldierly qualities of his predecessor. Johnston  was no doubt too manly an officer to take part in the romantic  conspiracies about him. He was every inch a brave soldier who did his  fighting in the open. Like Robert E. Lee, he joined the Confederacy in  conscientious good faith, and he met death bravely at Shiloh in April,  1862.    Sumner was a man of action and he faced the situation squarely. To him,  California and the nation will always be indebted. One of his first  decisive acts was to check the secession movement in Southern California  by placing a strong detachment of soldiers at Los Angeles. This force  proved enough to stop any incipient uprisings in that part of the state.  Some of the disturbing element in this district then moved over into  Nevada where cooperation was made with the pro-Confederate men there.  The Nevada rebel faction had made considerable headway by assuring  unsuspecting persons that it was acting on the authority of the  Confederate Government. On June 5, 1861, the rebel flag was unfurled at  Virginia City. Again Sumner acted. He immediately sent a Federal force  to garrison Fort Churchill, and a body of men under Major Blake and  Captain Moore seized all arms found in the possession of suspected  persons. A rebel militia company with four hundred men enrolled and one  hundred under arms was found and dispersed by the Federals. This  decisive action completely stopped any uprisings across the state line,  uprisings which might easily have spread into California.    In the meantime, under General Sumner's direction, soldiers had been  enlisted and were being rapidly drilled for any emergency. The War  Department, on being advised of this available force, at once sent the  following dispatch, which, with those that follow are typical of the  correspondence which the Pony Express couriers were now rushing across  the Continent toward and from Washington.      Telegraph and Pony Express.  Adjutant-General's Office.    Washington, July 24, 1861.  Brigadier General Sumner,  Commanding Department of the Pacific.    One regiment of infantry and five companies of cavalry have been  accepted from California to aid in protecting the overland mail route  via Salt Lake.    Please detail officers to muster these troops into service. Blanks will  be sent by steamer.    By order: George D. Ruggles.  Assistant Adjutant General.      While recognizing the great need of extending proper military protection  to the mail route, it must have been disheartening to Sumner and the  loyalists to see this force ordered into service outside the state. For  now, late in the summer of 1861, the time of national crisis--the  Californian trouble was approaching its climax. On July 20, the Union  army had been beaten at Bull Run and driven back, a rabble of fugitives,  into the panic stricken capital. Then came weeks and months of delay and  uncertainty while the overcautious McClellan sought to build up a new  military machine. The entire North was overspread with gloom; the  Confederates were jubilant and full of self-confidence. In California  the psychological situation was similar but even more acute, for  encouraged by Confederate success, the rebel faction became bolder than  ever, and openly planned to win the state election to be held on  September 4. If successful at the polls, the reins of organized  political power would pass into its hands and a secession convention  would be a direct possibility. And to intensify the danger was the  confirmed indifference or stubbornness of many citizens who seemed to  place petty personal differences before the interests of the state and  nation at large.    As is well known, Lincoln and the Federal Government accepted the defeat  at Bull Run calmly, and set about with grim determination to whip the  South at any cost. The President asked Congress for four hundred  thousand men and was voted five hundred thousand. In pursuance of such  policies, these urgent dispatches were hurried across the country:      War Department.  Washington, August 14, 1861.  Hon. John G. Downey,    Governor of California, Sacramento City, Cal.    Please organize, equip, and have mustered into service, at the earliest  date possible, four regiments of infantry and one regiment of cavalry,  to be placed at the disposal of General Sumner.    Simon Cameron,  Secretary of War.    By telegraph to Fort Kearney and thence by Pony Express and telegraph.    War Department, August 15, 1861.  Hon. John G. Downey,    Governor of California, Sacramento City, Cal.    In filling the requisition given you August 14th, for five regiments,  please make General J. H. Carleton of San Francisco, colonel of a  cavalry regiment, and give him proper authority to organize as promptly  as possible.    Simon Cameron,  Secretary of War.    Telegraph and Pony Express and telegraph.      The work of enlisting the five thousand men thus requisitioned was  carried forward with great rapidity. Within two weeks, on the 28th, the  Pony Express brought word that the War Department was about to order  this force overland into Texas, to act, no doubt, as a barrier to the  advancing Confederate armies who were then planning an invasion of New  Mexico as the first decisive step in carrying the conflict into the  heart of the Southwest. It was understood, further, that General Sumner  would be ordered to vacate his position as Commander of the Department  of the Pacific and lead his recruits into the service.    To the authorities at Washington, a campaign of aggression with western  troops had no"]]]
