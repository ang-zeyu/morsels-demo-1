Halting before one of these doors, one of the blacks produced the key  that hung at his girdle, and turned it in the lock. Then, pushing open  the grille, they entered with their captive. They were in a small  dungeon with heavy stone walls, floor and ceiling, and in the opposite  wall there was another grilled door. What lay beyond that door Conan  could not tell, but he did not believe it was another corridor. The  glimmering light of the torch, flickering through the bars, hinted at  shadowy spaciousness and echoing depths.    In one corner of the dungeon, near the door through which they had  entered, a cluster of rusty chains hung from a great iron ring set in  the stone. In these chains a skeleton dangled. Conan glared at it with  some curiosity, noticing the state of the bare bones, most of which  were splintered and broken; the skull which had fallen from the  vertebrae, was crushed as if by some savage blow of tremendous force.    Stolidly one of the blacks, not the one who had opened the door, removed  the chains from the ring, using his key on the massive lock, and dragged  the mass of rusty metal and shattered bones over to one side. Then they  fastened Conan's chains to that ring, and the third black turned his key  in the lock of the farther door, grunting when he had assured himself  that it was properly fastened.    Then they regarded Conan cryptically, slit-eyed ebony giants, the torch  striking highlights from their glossy skin.    He who held the key to the nearer door was moved to remark, gutturally:  'This your palace now, white dog-king! None but master and we know. All  palace sleep. We keep secret. You live and die here, maybe. Like him!'  He contemptuously kicked the shattered skull and sent it clattering  across the stone floor.    Conan did not deign to reply to the taunt, and the black, galled perhaps  by his prisoner's silence, muttered a curse, stooped and spat full in  the king's face. It was an unfortunate move for the black. Conan was  seated on the floor, the chains about his waist; ankles and wrists  locked to the ring in the wall. He could neither rise, nor move more  than a yard out from the wall. But there was considerable slack in the  chains that shackled his wrists, and before the bullet-shaped head could  be withdrawn out of reach, the king gathered this slack in his mighty  hand and smote the black on the head. The man fell like a butchered ox,  and his comrades stared to see him lying with his scalp laid open, and  blood oozing from his nose and ears.    But they attempted no reprisal, nor did they accept Conan's urgent  invitation to approach within reach of the bloody chain in his hand.  Presently, grunting in their ape-like speech, they lifted the senseless  black and bore him out like a sack of wheat, arms and legs dangling.  They used his key to lock the door behind them, but did not remove it  from the gold chain that fastened it to his girdle. They took the torch  with them, and as they moved up the corridor the darkness slunk behind  them like an animate thing. Their soft padding footsteps died away, with  the glimmer of their torch, and darkness and silence remained  unchallenged.          5    The Haunter of the Pits      Conan lay still, enduring the weight of his chains and the despair of  his position with the stoicism of the wilds that had bred him. He did  not move, because the jangle of his chains, when he shifted his body,  sounded startlingly loud in the darkness and stillness, and it was his  instinct, born of a thousand wilderness-bred ancestors, not to betray  his position in his helplessness. This did not result from a logical  reasoning process; he did not lie quiet because he reasoned that the  darkness hid lurking dangers that might discover him in his  helplessness. Xaltotun had assured him that he was not to be harmed, and  Conan believed that it was in the man's interest to preserve him, at  least for the time being. But the instincts of the wild were there, that  had caused him in his childhood to lie hidden and silent while wild  beasts prowled about his covert.    Even his keen eyes could not pierce the solid darkness. Yet after a  while, after a period of time he had no way of estimating, a faint glow  became apparent, a sort of slanting gray beam, by which Conan could see,  vaguely, the bars of the door at his elbow, and even make out the  skeleton of the other grille. This puzzled him, until at last he  realized the explanation. He was far below ground, in the pits below the  palace; yet for some reason a shaft had been constructed from somewhere  above. Outside, the moon had risen to a point where its light slanted  dimly down the shaft. He reflected that in this manner he could tell the  passing of the days and nights. Perhaps the sun, too, would shine down  that shaft, though on the other hand it might be closed by day. Perhaps  it was a subtle method of torture, allowing a prisoner but a glimpse of  daylight or moonlight.    His gaze fell on the broken bones in the farther corner, glimmering  dimly. He did not tax his brain with futile speculation as to who the  wretch had been and for what reason he had been doomed, but he wondered  at the shattered condition of the bones. They had not been broken on a  rack. Then, as he looked, another unsavory detail made itself evident.  The shin-bones were split lengthwise, and there was but one explanation;  they had been broken in that manner in order to obtain the marrow. Yet  what creature but man breaks bones for their marrow? Perhaps those  remnants were mute evidence of a horrible, cannibalistic feast, of some  wretch driven to madness by starvation. Conan wondered if his own bones  would be found at some future date, hanging in their rusty chains. He  fought down the unreasoning panic of a trapped wolf.    The Cimmerian did not curse, scream, weep or rave as a civilized man  might have done. But the pain and turmoil in his bosom were none the  less fierce. His great limbs quivered with the intensity of his  emotions. Somewhere, far to the westward, the Nemedian host was slashing  and burning its way through the heart of his kingdom. The small host of  the Poitanians could not stand before them. Prospero might be able to  hold Tarantia for weeks, or months; but eventually, if not relieved, he  must surrender to greater numbers. Surely the barons would rally to him  against the invaders. But in the meanwhile he, Conan, must lie helpless  in a darkened cell, while others led his spears and fought for his  kingdom. The king ground his powerful teeth in red rage.    Then he stiffened as outside the farther door he heard a stealthy step.  Straining his eyes he made out a bent, indistinct figure outside the  grille. There was a rasp of metal against metal, and he heard the clink  of tumblers, as if a key had been turned in the lock. Then the figure  moved silently out of his range of vision. Some guard, he supposed,  trying the lock. After a while he heard the sound repeated faintly  somewhere farther on, and that was followed by the soft opening of a  door, and then a swift scurry of softly shod feet retreated in the  distance. Then silence fell again.    Conan listened for what seemed a long time, but which could not have  been, for the moon still shone down the hidden shaft, but he heard no  further sound. He shifted his position at last, and his chains clanked.  Then he heard another, lighter footfall--a soft step outside the nearer  door, the door through which he had entered the cell. An instant later a  slender figure was etched dimly in the gray light.    'King Conan!' a soft voice intoned urgently. 'Oh, my lord, are you  there?'    'Where else?' he answered guardedly, twisting his head about to stare at  the apparition.    It was a girl who stood grasping the bars with her slender fingers. The  dim glow behind her outlined her supple figure through the wisp of silk  twisted about her loins, and shone vaguely on jeweled breast-plates. Her  dark eyes gleamed in the shadows, her white limbs glistened softly, like  alabaster. Her hair was a mass of dark foam, at the burnished luster of  which the dim light only hinted.    'The keys to your shackles and to the farther door!' she whispered, and  a slim white hand came through the bars and dropped three objects with a  clink to the flags beside him.    'What game is this?' he demanded. 'You speak in the Nemedian tongue, and  I have no friends in Nemedia. What deviltry is your master up to now?  Has he sent you here to mock me?'    'It is no mockery!' The girl was trembling violently. Her bracelets and  breast-plates clinked against the bars she grasped. 'I swear by Mitra! I  stole the keys from the black jailers. They are the keepers of the pits,  and each bears a key which will open only one set of locks. I made them  drunk. The one whose head you broke was carried away to a leech, and I  could not get his key. But the others I stole. Oh, please do not  loiter! Beyond these dungeons lie the pits which are the doors to hell.'    Somewhat impressed, Conan tried the keys dubiously, expecting to meet  only failure and a burst of mocking laughter. But he was galvanized to  discover that one, indeed, loosed him of his shackles, fitting not only  the lock that held them to the ring, but the locks on his limbs as well.  A few seconds later he stood upright, exulting fiercely in his  comparative freedom. A quick stride carried him to the grille, and his  fingers closed about a bar and the slender wrist that was pressed  against it, imprisoning the owner, who lifted her face bravely to his  fierce gaze.    'Who are you, girl?' he demanded. 'Why do you do this?'    'I am only Zenobia,' she murmured, with a catch of breathlessness, as if  in fright; 'only a girl of the king's seraglio.'    'Unless this is some cursed trick,' muttered Conan, 'I cannot see why  you bring me these keys.'    She bowed her dark head, and then lifted it and looked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4227"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Wireless Message; Or, The Castaways of Earthquake Island (#8)"],[1,"I will come over  here again, and arrange to stay until I have done all I can. I need  to get some of my special tools, and then, too, you will require  some other supplies, of which I will give you a list. I hope you  don't mind me speaking in this way, Mr. Fenwick, as though I knew  more about it than you do,\" added Tom, modestly.    \"Not a bit of it!\" cried the inventor heartily. \"I want the benefit  of your advice and experience, and I'll do just as you say. I hope  you can come back soon.\"    \"I'll return the first of the week,\" promised Tom, \"and then we'll  see what can be done. Now I'll go over the whole ship once more, and  see what I need. I also want to test the lifting capacity of your  gas bag.\"    The rest of the day was a busy one for our hero. With the aid of Mr.  Damon and the owner of the WHIZZER, he went over every point  carefully. Then, as it was too late to attempt the return flight to  Shopton, he telegraphed his father, and he and Mr. Damon remained  over night with Mr. Fenwick.    In the morning, having written out a list of the things that would  be needed, Tom went out to Franklin Field, and repaired his own  monoplane. It was found that one of the electric wires connected  with the motor had broken, thus cutting off the spark. It was soon  repaired, and, in the presence of a large crowd, Tom and Mr. Damon  started on their return flight.    \"Do you think you can make the WHIZZER work, Tom?\" asked Mr. Damon,  as they were flying high over Philadelphia.    \"I'm a little dubious about it,\" was the reply. \"But after I make some  changes I may have a different opinion. The whole affair is too big  and clumsy, that's the trouble; though the electrical part of it is  very good.\"    Shopton was reached without incident, in about three hours, and  there was no necessity, this time, of vol-planing back to earth.  After a short rest, Tom began getting together a number of special  tools and appliances, which he proposed taking back to Philadelphia  with him.    The young inventor made another trip to Mr. Fenwick's house the  first of the following week. He went by train this time, as he had  to ship his tools, and Mr. Damon did not accompany him. Then, with  the assistance of the inventor of the WHIZZER, and several of his  mechanics, Tom began making the changes on the airship.    \"Do you think you can make it fly?\" asked Mr. Fenwick, anxiously,  after several days of labor.    \"I hope so,\" replied our hero, and there was more confidence in his  tone than there had been before. As the work progressed, he began to  be more hopeful. \"I'll make a trial flight, anyhow, in a few days,\"  he added.    \"Then I must send word to Mr. Damon,\" decided Mr. Fenwick. \"He wants  to be on hand to see it, and, if possible, go up; so he told me.\"    \"All right,\" assented Tom. \"I only hope it does go up,\" he  concluded, in a low tone.          CHAPTER VIII    ANDY FOGER'S REVENGE      During the following week, Tom was kept busy over the airship. He  made many important changes, and one of these was to use a new kind  of gas in the balloon bag. He wanted a gas with a greater lifting  power than that of the ordinary illuminating vapor which Mr. Fenwick  had used.    \"Well,\" remarked Tom, as he came from the airship shed one  afternoon, \"I think we can give it a try-out, Mr. Fenwick, in a few  days more. I shall have to go back to Shopton to get some articles I  need, and when I come back I will bring Mr. Damon with me, and we  will see what the WHIZZER can do.\"    \"Do you mean we will make a trial flight?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"For how long a distance?\"    \"It all depends on how she behaves,\" answered Tom, with a smile. \"If  possible, we'll make a long flight.\"    \"Then I'll tell you what I'm going to do,\" went on the inventor,  \"I'm going to put aboard a stock of provisions, and some other  supplies and stores, in case we are two or three days in the air.\"    \"It might not be a bad plan,\" agreed Tom, \"though I hardly think we  will be gone as long as that.\"    \"Well, being out in the air always makes me hungry,\" proceeded Mr.  Fenwick, \"so I'm going to take plenty of food along.\"    The time was to come, and that very soon, when this decision of the  inventor of the WHIZZER stood the adventurers in good stead.    Tom returned to Shopton the next day, and sent word to have Mr.  Damon join him in time to go back to the Quaker City two days later.    \"But why don't you start right back to Philadelphia to-morrow,\"  asked Mr. Swift of his son.    \"Because,\" answered Tom, and that was all the reason he would give,  though had any one seen him reading a certain note a few minutes  before that, which note was awaiting him on his arrival from the  Quaker City, they would not have wondered at his decision.    The note was brief. It merely said:    \"Won't you come, and have some apple turnovers? The new cook is a  treasure, and the girls are anxious to meet you.\"    It was signed: Mary Nestor.    \"I think I could enjoy some apple turnovers,\" remarked Tom, with a  smile.    Having gotten ready the few special appliances he wished to take  back to Philadelphia with him, Tom went, that evening, to call on  Miss Nestor. True to her promise, the girl had a big plate full of  apple turnovers, which she gaily offered our hero on his arrival,  and, on his laughing declination to partake of so many, she ushered  him into a room full of pretty girls, saying:    \"They'll help you eat them, Tom. Girls, here is Mr. Swift, who  doesn't mind going up in the air or under the ocean, or even  catching runaway horses,\" by which last she referred to the time Tom  saved her life, and first made her acquaintance.    As for the young inventor, he gave a gasp, almost as if he had  plunged into a bath of icy water, at the sight of so many pretty  faces staring at him. He said afterward that he would rather have  vol-planed back to earth from a seven-mile height, than again face  such a battery of sparkling eyes.    But our hero soon recovered himself, and entered into the merriment  of the evening, and, before he knew it he was telling Miss Nestor  and her attractive guests something of his exploits.    \"But I'm talking altogether too much about myself.\" he said,  finally. \"How is the new cook Miss Nestor; and have you heard from  your father and mother since they sailed on the RESOLUTE for the  West Indies?\"    \"As to the new cook, she is a jewel of the first water,\" answered  Miss Nestor. \"We all like her, and she is anxious for another ride  in a taxicab, as she calls your auto.\"    \"She shall have it,\" declared Tom, \"for those are the best apple  turnovers I ever ate.\"    \"I'll tell her so,\" declared Mary. \"She'll appreciate it coming from  an inventor of your ability.\"    \"Have you heard from your parents?\" asked Tom, anxious to change the  subject.    \"Oh, yes. I had a wire to-day. They stopped at St. Augustine to let  me know they were having a glorious time aboard the yacht. Mr.  Hosbrook, the owner, is an ideal host, mamma said. They are  proceeding directly to the West Indies, now. I do hope they will  arrive safely. They say there are bad storms down there at this time  of year.\"    \"Perhaps, if they are shipwrecked, Mr. Swift will go to their rescue  in one of his airships, or a submarine,\" suggested Mabel Jackson,  one of the several pretty girls.    \"Oh, I hope he doesn't have to!\" exclaimed Mary. \"Don't speak of  shipwrecks! It makes me shudder,\" and she seemed unduly alarmed.    \"Of course they won't have any trouble,\" asserted Tom, confidently,  more to reassure Miss Nestor, than from any knowledge he possessed;  \"but if they do get cast away on a desert island, I'll certainly go  to their rescue,\" he added.    It was late when Tom started for home that night, for the society of  Miss Nestor and her friends made the time pass quickly. He promised  to call again, and try some more samples of the new cook's culinary  art, as soon as he had gotten Mr. Fenwick's airship in shape for  flying.    As, later that night, the young inventor came in sight of his home,  and the various buildings and shops surrounding it, his first glance  was toward the shed which contained his monoplane, BUTTERFLY. That  little craft was Tom's pet. It had not cost him anything like as  much as had his other inventions, either in time or money, but he  cared more for it than for his big airship, RED CLOUD. This was  principally because the BUTTERFLY was so light and airy, and could  be gotten ready so quickly for a flight across country. It was  capable of long endurance, too, for an extra large supply of  gasolene and oil was carried aboard.    So it was with rather a start of surprise that Tom saw a light in  the structure where the BUTTERFLY was housed.    \"I wonder if dad or Mr. Jackson can be out there?\" he mused. \"Yet, I  don't see why they should be. They wouldn't be going for a flight at  night. Or perhaps Mr. Damon arrived, and is out looking it over.\"    A moment's reflection, however, told Tom that this last surmise  could not be true, since the eccentric man had telegraphed, saying  he would not arrive until the next day.    \"Somebody's out there, however,\" went on Tom, \"and I'm going to see  who it is. I hope it isn't Eradicate monkeying with the monoplane.  He's very curious, and he might get it out of order.\"    Tom increased his pace, and moved swiftly but softly toward the  shed. If there was an intruder inside he wanted to surprise him.  There were large windows to the place, and they would give a good  view of the interior. As Tom approached, the light within flickered,  and moved to and fro.    Tom reached one of the casements, and peered in. He caught a glimpse  of a moving figure, and he heard a peculiar ripping sound. Then, as  he sprang toward the front door, the light suddenly went out, and  the young inventor could hear some one running from the shop.    \"They've seen me, and are trying to get away,\" thought the lad. \"I  must catch them!\""]]]
