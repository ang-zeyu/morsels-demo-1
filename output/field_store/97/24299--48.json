It would be impossible even to allude to every point of character that  should be observed in choosing a wife. Frugality, or the power to  abstain from unnecessary expenditure, is very important, so is  punctuality. As to good temper, it is a most difficult thing to  ascertain beforehand; smiles are so easily put on for the _lover's_  visits. We know the old conundrum--why are ladies like bells? Because  you never know what metal they are made of until you _ring_ them. An  ingenuous girl thus alluded to the change that is frequently perceptible  after marriage. \"Your future husband seems very exacting: he has been  stipulating for all sorts of things,\" said her mother to her. \"Never  mind, Mamma,\" said the affectionate girl, who was already dressed for  the wedding; \"these are his last wishes.\"    There is, however, one way of roughly guessing the qualifications of a  girl for the most responsible position of a wife. Find out the character  of her mother, and whether the daughter has been a good one and a good  sister. Ask yourself, if you respect as well as admire her, and remember  the words of Fichte: \"No true and enduring love can exist without  esteem; every other draws regret after it, and is unworthy of any noble  soul.\"    Thackeray said of women: \"What we (men) want for the most part is a  humble, flattering, smiling, child-loving, tea-making being, who laughs  at our jokes however old they may be, coaxes and wheedles us in our  humours, and fondly lies to us through life.\" And he says of a wife:  \"She ought to be able to make your house pleasant to your friends; she  ought to attract them to it by her grace. Let it be said of her, 'What  an uncommonly nice woman Mrs. Brown is!' Let her be, if not clever, an  appreciator of cleverness. Above all, let her have a sense of humour,  for a woman without a laugh in her is the greatest bore in existence.\"  It is, we think, only very weak men who would wish their wives to  \"fondly lie\" to them in this way. Better to be occasionally wound up  like an eight-day clock by one's wife and made to go right. There is no  one who gives such wise and brave advice as a good wife. She is another,  a calmer and a better self. The heart of her husband doth safely trust  in her, for he knows that when her criticism is most severe it is spoken  in love and for his own good. Lord Beaconsfield described his wife as  \"the most severe of critics, but a perfect wife.\"    Burns the poet, in speaking of the qualities of a good wife, divided  them into ten parts. Four of these he gave to good temper, two to good  sense, one to wit, one to beauty--such as a sweet face, eloquent eyes, a  fine person, a graceful carriage; and the other two parts he divided  amongst the other qualities belonging to or attending on a wife--such as  fortune, connections, education (that is, of a higher standard than  ordinary), family blood, &c.; but he said, \"Divide those two degrees as  you please, only remember that all these minor proportions must be  expressed by fractions, for there is not any one of them that is  entitled to the dignity of an integer.\"    Let us add the famous advice given by Lord Burleigh to his son: \"When it  shall please God,\" said he, \"to bring thee to man's estate, use great  providence and circumspection in choosing thy wife, for from thence will  spring all thy future good or evil. And it is an action of thy life,  like unto a stratagem of war, wherein a man can err but once.... Inquire  diligently of her disposition, and how her parents have been inclined in  their youth. Let her not be poor, how generous (well-born) soever; for a  man can buy nothing in the market with gentility. Nor choose a base and  uncomely creature altogether for wealth, for it will cause contempt in  others, and loathing in thee. Neither make choice of a dwarf or a fool,  for by the one thou shalt beget a race of pigmies, while the other will  be thy continual disgrace, and it will yirke (irk) thee to hear her  talk. For thou shalt find it to thy great grief that there is nothing  more fulsome than a she-fool.\"    The ideal wife is either what Crashaw calls an \"impossible she,\" or--      \"Somewhere in the world must be    She that I have prayed to see,    She that Love assigns to me.\"    But then--      \"Shall we ever, ever meet?    Shall I find in thee, my sweet,    Visions true and life complete?\"    To the old question, \"Who can _find_?\" it may too often be replied, Who  _seeks_ \"a virtuous woman\"? Is she wealthy? is she pretty? is she  talented? are questions asked more frequently than Is she good,  sensible, industrious, affectionate? And yet that man takes to himself  one of the bitterest of earth's curses who marries carelessly instead of  seeking with all diligence for those qualities in a wife that are the  foundation of lasting happiness.    A minister's wife falling asleep in church, her husband thus addressed  her: \"Mrs. B., a' body kens that when I got ye for my wife I got nae  beauty; yer frien's ken that I got nae siller; and if I dinna get God's  grace I shall hae a puir bargain indeed.\" If men would seek for wives  women with the grace of God, if they would choose them as they do their  clothes, for qualities that will last, they would get much better  bargains.    One reason for this carelessness about the character of a wife may be  found in the prevailing opinion that there is little or no room for  choice in matters matrimonial. Sir John More (father of the Chancellor,  Sir Thomas) was often heard to say, \"I would compare the multitude of  women which are to be chosen for wives unto a bag full of snakes, having  among them a single eel. Now, if a man should put his hand into this  bag, he may chance to light on the eel; but it is a hundred to one he  shall be stung by a snake.\"    Perhaps the lottery theory of marriage was never stated more strongly or  with greater cynicism; but is it true? If it were, to expend care and  attention in choosing a wife would be to labour in vain. If, however,  marriage is by no means such an affair of chance, a prudent choice may  prevent a man from being stung by a snake, and may give him a goodly eel  as his marriage portion. The important thing to do is to keep well in  mind the fact that a man's prospect of domestic felicity does not  depend upon the face, the fortune, or the accomplishments of his wife,  but upon her character. The son of Sirach says that he would rather  dwell with a lion and a dragon than to keep house with a wicked woman.  \"He that hath hold of her is as though he held a scorpion. A loud crying  woman and a scold shall be sought out to drive away the enemies.\" On the  other hand, \"the grace of a wife delighteth her husband, and her  discretion will fatten his bones. A silent and loving woman is a gift of  the Lord; and there is nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed.\"          CHAPTER V    THE CHOICE OF A HUSBAND.      \"How shall I know if I do choose the right?\"--_Shakespeare._      \"God, the best maker of marriages, bless you!\"--_Ibid._         \"And while thou livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and       uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee right, because       he hath not the gift to woo in other places; for these fellows of       infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours,       they do always reason themselves out again. What! a speaker is       but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a       straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curled       pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax       hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon; or,       rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it shines bright, and       never changes, but keeps his course truly.\"--_Ibid._      They that enter into the state of marriage cast a die of the greatest  contingency, and yet of the greatest interest in the world, next to the  last throw for eternity. Life or death, felicity or a lasting sorrow,  are in the power of marriage. A woman, indeed, ventures most, for she  hath no sanctuary to retire to from an evil husband; she must dwell  upon her sorrow and hatch the eggs which her own folly or infelicity  hath produced; and she is more under it, because her tormentor hath a  warrant of prerogative, and the woman may complain to God, as subjects  do of tyrant princes; but otherwise she hath no appeal in the causes of  unkindness. And though the man can run from many hours of his sadness,  yet he must return to it again; and when he sits among his neighbours he  remembers the objection that is in his bosom, and he sighs deeply. \"The  boys and the pedlars and the fruiterers shall tell of this man when he  is carried to his grave that he lived and died a poor, wretched person.\"    In these words Jeremy Taylor puts before men and women the issues of  choice in matrimony. What, however, concerns us in this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],[0,"Sanders of the River (#8)"],[1,"said \"nay\" to him, even  though in the assembly were three men who by custom might claim the  chieftainship.    Sanders heard of the new chief and was puzzled.    \"Etabo?\" he repeated--this was how Bosambo called himself--\"I do not  remember the man--yet if he can put backbone into the people I do not  care who he is.\"    Backbone or cunning, or both, Bosambo was certainly installed.    \"He has many strange practices,\" reported a native agent to Sanders.  \"Every day he assembles the men of the village and causes them to walk  past a _pelebi_ (table) on which are many eggs. And it is his command  that each man as he passes shall take an egg so swiftly that no eye may  see him take it. And if the man bungle or break the egg, or be slow,  this new chief puts shame upon him, whipping him.\"    \"It is a game,\" said Sanders; but for the life of him he could not see  what game it was. Report after report reached him of the new chief's  madness. Sometimes he would take the unfortunate Ochori out by night,  teaching them such things as they had never known before. Thus he  instructed them in what manner they might seize upon a goat so that the  goat could not cry. Also how to crawl on their bellies inch by inch so  that they made no sound or sign. All these things the Ochori did,  groaning aloud at the injustice and the labour of it.    \"I'm dashed if I can understand it!\" said Sanders, knitting his brows,  when the last report came in. \"With anybody but the Ochori this would  mean war. But the Ochori!\"    Notwithstanding his contempt for their fighting qualities, he kept his  Police Houssas ready.    But there was no war. Instead, there came complaint from the Akasava  that \"many leopards were in the woods.\"    Leopards will keep, thought Sanders, and, anyway, the Akasava were good  enough hunters to settle that palaver without outside help. The next  report was alarming. In two weeks these leopards had carried off three  score of goats, twenty bags of salt, and much ivory.    Leopards eat goats; there might conceivably be fastidious leopards that  cannot eat goats without salt; but a leopard does not take ivory tusks  even to pick his teeth with. So Sanders made haste to journey up the  river, because little things were considerable in a country where people  strain at gnats and swallow whole caravans.    \"Lord, it is true,\" said the chief of the Akasava, with some emotion,  \"these goats disappear night by night, though we watch them; also the  salt and ivory, because that we did not watch.\"    \"But no leopard could take these things,\" said Sanders irritably. \"These  are thieves.\"    The chief's gesture was comprehensive.    \"Who could thieve?\" he said. \"The N'Gombi people live very far away;  also the Isisi. The Ochori are fools, and, moreover, afraid.\"    Then Sanders remembered the egg games, and the midnight manoeuvres of  the Ochori.    \"I will call on this new chief,\" he said; and crossed the river that  day.    Sending a messenger to herald his coming, he waited two miles out of the  city, and the councillors and wise men came out to him with offerings of  fish and fruit.    \"Where is your chief?\" he asked.    \"Lord, he is ill,\" they said gravely. \"This day there came to him a  feeling of sickness, and he fell down moaning. We have carried him to  his hut.\"    Sanders nodded.    \"I will see him,\" he said grimly.    They led him to the door of the chief's hut, and Sanders went in. It was  very dark, and in the darkest corner lay a prostrate man. Sanders bent  over him, touched his pulse lightly, felt gingerly for the swelling on  the neck behind the ears for a sign of sleeping sickness. No symptom  could he find; but on the bare shoulder, as his fingers passed over the  man's flesh, he felt a scar of singular regularity; then he found  another, and traced their direction. The convict brand of the Monrovian  Government was familiar to him.    \"I thought so,\" said Sanders, and gave the moaning man a vigorous kick.    \"Come out into the light, Bosambo of Monrovia,\" he said; and Bosambo  rose obediently and followed the Commissioner into the light.    They stood looking at one another for several minutes; then Sanders,  speaking in the dialect of the Pepper Coast, said--    \"I have a mind to hang you, Bosambo.\"    \"That is as your Excellency wishes,\" said Bosambo.    Sanders said nothing, tapping his boot with his walking-stick and gazing  thoughtfully downward.    \"Having made thieves, could you make men of these people?\" he said,  after a while.    \"I think they could fight now, for they are puffed with pride because  they have robbed the Akasava,\" said Bosambo.    Sanders bit the end of his stick like a man in doubt.    \"There shall be neither theft nor murder,\" he said. \"No more chiefs or  chiefs' sons shall die suddenly,\" he added significantly.    \"Master, it shall be as you desire.\"    \"As for the goats you have stolen, them you may keep, and the teeth  (ivory) and the salt also. For if you hand them back to Akasava you will  fill their stomachs with rage, and that would mean war.\"    Bosambo nodded slowly.    \"Then you shall remain, for I see you are a clever man, and the Ochori  need such as you. But if----\"    \"Master, by the fat of my heart I will do as you wish,\" said Bosambo;  \"for I have always desired to be a chief under the British.\"    Sanders was half-way back to headquarters before he missed his  field-glasses, and wondered where he could have dropped them. At that  identical moment Bosambo was exhibiting the binoculars to his admiring  people.    \"From this day forth,\" said Bosambo, \"there shall be no lifting of goats  nor stealing of any kind. This much I told the great Sandi, and as a  sign of his love, behold, he gave me these things of magic that eat up  space.\"    \"Lord,\" said a councillor in awe, \"did you know the Great One?\"    \"I have cause to know him,\" said Bosambo modestly, \"for I am his son.\"    Fortunately Sanders knew nothing of this interesting disclosure.            CHAPTER IV.      THE DROWSY ONE.      There were occasions when Sanders came up against the outer world, when  he learnt, with something like bewilderment, that beyond the farthermost  forests, beyond the lazy, swelling, blue sea, there were men and women  who lived in houses and carefully tabooed such subjects as violent death  and such horrid happenings as were daily features of his life.    He had to treat with folk who, in the main, were illogical and who  believed in spirits. When you deal in the abstract with government of  races so influenced, a knowledge of constitutional law and economics is  fairly valueless.    There is one type of man that can rule native provinces wisely, and that  type is best represented by Sanders.    There are other types, as, for instance:    Once upon a time a young man came from England with a reputation. He was  sent by the Colonial Office to hold a district under Sanders as Deputy  Commissioner. He was a Bachelor of Law, had read Science, and had  acquired in a methodical fashion a working acquaintance with Swaheli,  bacteriology, and medicines. He was a very grave young man, and the  first night of his arrival he kept Sanders (furtively yawning) out of  his bed whilst he demonstrated a system whereby the aboriginal could be  converted--not converted spiritually, but from unproductive vagrancy to  a condition of good citizenship.    Sanders said nothing beyond using the conventional expressions of polite  interest, and despatched the young man and his tremendous baggage to an  up-country station, with his official blessing.    Torrington--this was the grave young man's name--established himself at  Entoli, and started forth to instil into the heathen mind the elementary  principles of applied mechanics. In other words he taught them, through  the medium of Swaheli--which they imperfectly understood--and a tin  kettle, the lesson of steam. They understood the kettle part, but could  not quite comprehend what meat he was cooking, and when he explained for  the fortieth time that he was only cooking water, they glanced  significantly one at the other and agreed that he was not quite right in  his head.    They did not tell him this much to his face, for cannibals have very  good manners--though their table code leaves much to be desired.    Mr. Torrington tried them with chemical experiments, showing them how  sulphuric acid applied to sugar produced Su^{2}, Su^{4}, or words to  that effect. He gained a reputation as a magician as a result, and in  more huts than one he was regarded and worshipped as a Great and Clever  Devil--which in a sense he was. But the first time he came up against  the spirit of the people, his science, his law, and his cut-and-dried  theories went _phutt_! And that is where Sanders came in--Sanders who  had forgotten all the chemistry he ever knew, and who, as a student of  Constitutional Law, was the rankest of failures.    It came about in this way.    There was a young man in Isisi who prophesied that on such a day, at  such an hour, the river would rise and drown the people. When Mr.  Torrington heard of this prophecy he was amused, and at first took no  notice of it. But it occurred to him that here might be a splendid  opportunity for revealing to the barbarian a little of that science with  which he was so plentifully endowed.    So he drew a large sectional plan, showing--      (_a_) the bed of the river;    (_b_) the height of the banks;    (_c_) the maximum rise of the river;    (_d_) the height of the surrounding country; and demonstrated as            plainly as possible the utter absurdity of the prophecy.    Yet the people were unconvinced, and were preparing to abandon the  village when Sanders arrived on the scene. He sent for the prophet, who  was a young man of neurotic tendencies, and had a wooden prison cage  built on the bank of the river, into which the youth was introduced.    \"You will stay here,\" said Sanders, \"and when the"]]]
