[Illustration: FIG. 14.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE CLOUDED YELLOW  BUTTERFLY.]    Several naturalists have amused themselves by performing experiments and  making calculations on the efficiency of the masticating and digesting  powers of the caterpillar. The illustrious R['e]aumur, for example, proved  that some of the cabbage eaters disposed of more than twice their own  weight of food in twenty-four hours, during which time their weight  increased one-tenth. Let us see what this would be equivalent to in  human beings: A man weighing eleven stone would devour over three  hundred pounds of food in a day, and at the end of that day weigh about  fifteen pounds more than he did at the beginning!    So the young caterpillar eats, and rests, and grows, till, while still  young, its body has become too large for the already tightened skin. It  evidently feels very uncomfortable. Its appetite fails, and it remains  for a time perfectly quiet in one spot, having previously spun a little  carpet of silk to form a firm foothold during its temporary  indisposition. Its colours have also become dingy, and anyone, not  understanding the character of its growth, might easily be led to  suppose that the poor creature was displaying the earlier symptoms of a  serious and perhaps fatal illness.    But soon an encouraging symptom is observed. The caterpillar begins to  get restless. Its front segments are turned alternately right and left,  and are also made to swell out much beyond their normal size. Then in a  very short time--often less than a minute from the first appearances of  restlessness--the skin, which has become somewhat dry and brittle,  splits along the back over the second, third and fourth segments,  revealing a new and bright coat beneath. The caterpillar continues its  struggles and, in addition to the previous movements, causes the  swelling to move backward along the body. This, acting like a wedge,  causes the rent in the old coat to extend in that direction.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE DARK GREEN FRITILLARY  BUTTERFLY.]    The caterpillar now draws its head backward, and, with a few convulsive  struggles, pulls the front segments out of their old skin, and passes  its head out of the rent in the back. With its foremost segments thus  rendered perfectly free, it walks straight out of the old garment, which  is left still fixed by the legs to the silken carpet.    The larva, although now fresh and smart in its appearance, is exhausted  by these struggles and its prolonged fast. The new skin, moreover, is  very soft and tender, even to the cases of the head and legs, which are  normally very hard. But a short period of rest suffices to dry its skin  and sharpen its appetite, and then it eats more vigorously than ever.    We will now leave the caterpillar for a moment while we look at its  cast-off clothes. They are still clinging to a stem so firmly that they  can scarcely be removed without injury. The hard shell that covered the  head and jaws is perfect in form, and so are the claws and cases of the  legs. All the hairs or spines that happened to adorn the previous owner  still retain their positions; and the whole skin, although always more  or less shrivelled, is sometimes so slightly altered in form that it  might be mistaken for a living caterpillar if not closely examined.    But this is not all. For, according to the accounts of some  authoritative observers, the lining of the digestive organs, which is  really a continuation of the outer skin, is cast off (or rather cast  _out_) at the same time, as are also the linings of the larger breathing  tubes which are presently to be described.    We have seen that some caterpillars, on quitting their egg cases (which  may really be regarded as the first moult), make their first meal of the  old covering. So also some of them, in their future moultings, exhibit  an apparently useless economy (seeing that they are surrounded by an  abundance of their natural vegetable diet) by devouring their old coats!  In the face of this fact we can hardly describe them as strict  vegetarians.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE PURPLE EMPEROR  BUTTERFLY.]    Having thus passed through its first hardship, the caterpillar has by no  means seen the end of the troubles and dangers that beset it; for,  during its existence in the larval state, it has to go through a series  of three, four, five, or even six moults, all of which are periods of  considerable inconvenience, and perhaps even pain, and frequently prove  fatal. And it is by no means an uncommon thing to meet with the lifeless  body of an unfortunate individual who, as shown by its shabby appearance  and the silken carpet under its feet, has evidently fallen a victim to  the dangerous process of ridding itself of an old garment.    But this is only one of the many dangers to which caterpillars are  exposed. Throughout every hour of the day the sharp and hungry eyes of  the numerous insect-eating birds are searching the leaves for such  delicacies to satisfy the wants of themselves and their broods. The  lively little lizards, too, during the sunny hours are busily engaged in  searching them out among the foliage of heaths and banks.    Very formidable enemies also exist in the form of Ichneumon and other  species of flies, which pierce the skins of caterpillars with their  sharp _ovipositors_, and lay their eggs within the bodies of the  unfortunate victims. As soon as the young larvae are hatched from these  eggs, they commence feeding on the fatty substance stored beneath the  caterpillar's skin. They carefully avoid, at first, attacking the vital  organs of their host's body, and in this way secure for themselves a  more lasting supply of fresh food. When the fatty substance is nearly  all gone, they eat their way into the more important structures, of  course steadily growing all the time; and so, even though the body of  the caterpillar is rapidly diminishing, the total bulk shows often no  very appreciable decrease in size. When the larvae of the flies are fully  fed, they either change to the pupa within the carcase of their host, or  eat their way out of its body and construct for themselves a cocoon in  which to undergo the transformation.    As for the caterpillar itself, it sometimes dies before the time for its  metamorphosis has arrived; but it often changes to the chrysalis before  its fate is sealed. In this latter case, a number of flies, having  undergone their final transformation within the chrysalis shell (there  being but little else than shell remaining of the victim's body), break  forth from the remains of the carcase somewhere about the time at which  the butterfly or moth should have appeared.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--AN ICHNEUMON FLY (_Cryptus Migrator_).]    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--ANOTHER ICHNEUMON FLY (_Pimpla Instigator_).]    Caterpillars have also their nocturnal enemies and devourers, among  which may be mentioned frogs, toads, newts, and insect-eating mammals.    We must now learn something of the structure of caterpillars; and then  become acquainted with their habits, and the change to the chrysalis or  pupa.    Take a caterpillar from your garden, preferably a full-grown one of a  rather large species, that is not very densely covered with hair, and  examine it carefully as we note the main points in its structure. The  first point that strikes our notice is the division of its body into  segments or rings, separated from each other by a more or less distinct  line or slight constriction of the body.    There are thirteen of these segments, reckoning, as is usual, the head  as the first.    The head is usually very hard, and often of a much darker colour than  the rest of the body. It is also frequently divided into two lobes by a  couple of oblique lines, between which the parts of the mouth are  situated. The two powerful horizontal jaws, to which we have already  referred, are very hard and sharp, and curved like a sickle, and  therefore splendidly adapted for biting from the edges of leaves. The  head is also provided with a pair of antennae, usually very short and  inconspicuous and protected by a horny covering.    Unlike the perfect insect, the caterpillar has no large compound eyes,  but twelve very small simple eyes, situated on the cheeks, very near the  mouth--six on each side.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--THE CATERPILLAR OF THE ANGLE SHADES MOTH  (_Meticulosa_).]    If you examine them with a magnifier, you see that each one is provided  with a small and very convex lens--a lens of very _short focus_, such as  would be used for the examination of small objects held very near to the  eye. From this arrangement we should be inclined to conclude that the  caterpillar can see only those objects that are close to its mouth; and  this idea is strengthened if you place one in a box containing a number  of leaves, one of which is that of its own food plant. It will wander  about the box, apparently looking at every part of every leaf it passes,  after the manner of a very short-sighted individual, and never taking a  general look round. A butterfly or a moth can see a flower in the  distance, for it flies unhesitatingly from one to another in the  straightest and shortest path, but if you place a caterpillar in the  centre of a ring composed of a leaf of its food plant and nine others  from other plants, the chances are (nine to one) that it will _not_ walk  towards what it would like to have.    Again, the eyes are situated on the _lower_ part of the cheek, directed  slightly downward, and are therefore adapted for seeing what is just"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#8)"],[1,"climate, have much to do in determining the form,  size, and character of cattle. In Lithuania, cattle attain an immense  size, with but moderate pretensions to general excellence, while the  Irish Kerry and Scotch Grampian cows but little exceed the largest  sheep; yet the last are compact and well-made, and yield a good return  for the food consumed. Every country, and almost every district, has its  peculiar breeds, which by long association have become adapted to the  food and circumstances of its position, and when found profitable, they  should be exchanged for others, only after the most thorough trial of  superior fitness for the particular location, in those proposed to be  introduced.    More attention has been paid to the improvement of the various breeds of  cattle in England, than in any other country; and it is there they have  attained the greatest perfection in form and character for the various  purposes to which they are devoted. We have derived, directly from Great  Britain, not only the parent stock from which nearly all our cattle are  descended, but also most of those fresh importations, to which we have  looked for improvement on the present race of animals.    A few choice Dutch cattle, generally black and white, and of large size,  good forms, and good milkers, with a decided tendency to fatten, have  been occasionally introduced among us, but not in numbers sufficient to  keep up a distinct breed; and in the hands of their importers, or  immediate successors, their peculiar characteristics have soon become  merged in those herds by which they were surrounded. Some few French and  Spanish cattle, the descendants of those remote importations, made when  the colonies of those kingdoms held possession of our northern, western,  and southern frontiers, still exist in those sections; and although  possessing no claims to particular superiority, at least in any that  have come within our notice, yet they are so well acclimated, and  adapted to their various localities, as to render it inexpedient to  attempt supplanting them, except with such as are particularly  meritorious.      Native Cattle.    This is a favorite term with Americans, and comprehends every thing in  the country, excepting such as are of a pure and distinct breed. It  embraces some of the best, some of the worst, and some of almost every  variety, shape, color, and character of the bovine race. The designation  has no farther meaning, than that they are indigenous to the soil, and  do not belong to any well-defined or distinct variety.    The best native cattle of the Union are undoubtedly to be found in the  Northeastern states. Most of the early emigrant cattle in that section  were from the southern part of England, where the Devon cattle abound;  and though not at the present time bearing a close resemblance to that  breed, unless it has been impressed upon them by more recent  importations, yet a large number have that general approximation in  character, features, and color, which entitles them to claim a near  kindred with one of the choicest cultivated breeds. They have the same  symmetry, but not in general the excessive delicacy of form, which  characterizes the Devons; the same intelligence, activity, and vigor in  the working cattle, and the same tendency to fattening; but they are  usually better for the dairy than their imported ancestors. Some  valuable intermixtures have occasionally been made among them. Among  these, there have been many brindled cattle widely disseminated, of  great merit as workers, and not often surpassed for the dairy and  shambles.    The Herefords have in a few instances been introduced among the eastern  cattle, and apparently with great improvement. The importation made by  Admiral Coffin, of four choice Hereford bulls and cows, which were  presented to the State Agricultural Society of Massachusetts, nearly  thirty years since, is especially to be mentioned, as resulting in  decided benefit wherever they were disseminated. Some of the old  Yorkshire, or as they are sometimes styled, the long-horned Durhams,  have been introduced, though these have been isolated individuals and  never perpetuated as a separate breed. A few small importations have  been made of the Short Horns and Ayrshires, but neither of these have  been bred in the New England states in distinct herds, to any extent.    Their _native breed_ has hitherto, and generally with good reason,  possessed claims on the attention of their owners, which, with some  slight exceptions, it has not been in the power of any rivals to  supplant. With entire adaptedness to the soil, climate, and wants of the  farmer, an originally good stock has, in frequent instances, been  carefully fostered, and the breeding animals selected with a strict  reference to their fitness for perpetuating the most desirable  qualities. As a consequence of this intelligent and persevering policy,  widely, but not universally pursued, they have a race of cattle, though  possessing considerable diversity of size and color, yet coinciding in a  remarkable degree in the possession of those utilitarian features, which  so justly commend them to our admiration.    In proceeding southwestwardly through New York, New Jersey, and  elsewhere, we shall find in this branch of stock, a greater diversity  and less uniform excellence; though they have extensive numbers of  valuable animals. Here and there will be found a choice collection of  some favorite foreign breed, which emigrants have brought from their  native home, as did the Pagan colonists their penates or household gods;  the cherished associates of early days, and the only relics of their  father-land. Such are an occasional small herd of polled or hornless  cattle, originally derived from Suffolk or Galloway, excellent both for  the dairy and shambles; the Kyloe, or West Highland, (Scottish,) a hardy  animal, unrivalled for beef; the Welsh runt; the Irish cattle; the  crumpled-horn Alderney, and some others.      The Devon    Is among the oldest distinctly cultivated breeds in this country, as it  undoubtedly is of England, and probably it is the most universal  favorite. This popularity is well deserved, and it is based upon several  substantial considerations. They are beautifully formed, possessing  excessive fineness and symmetry of frame, yet with sufficient bone and  muscle to render them perfectly hardy; and they are among the most  vigorous and active of working cattle. They have great uniformity of  appearance in every feature, size, shape, horns, and color. The cows and  bulls appear small, but the ox is much larger; and both he and the dam,  on cutting up, are found to weigh much beyond the estimates which an eye  accustomed only to ordinary breeds, would have assigned to them. The  flesh is finely marbled or interspersed with alternate fat and lean, and  is of superior quality and flavor.    The cows invariably yield milk of great richness, and when appropriately  bred, none surpass them for the quantity of butter and cheese it yields.  Mr. Bloomfield, the manager of the late Lord Leicester's estate at  Holkham, has, by careful attention, somewhat increased the size, without  impairing the beauty of their form, and so successful has he been in  developing their milking properties, that his average product of butter  from each cow, is 4 lbs. per week for the whole year. He has challenged  England to milk an equal number of cows of any breed, against 40 pure  Devons, to be selected out of his own herd, without as yet having found  a competitor. Although this is not a test of their merits, and by no  means decides their superiority, yet it shows the great confidence  reposed in them by their owner. The Devon ox, under six years old, has  come up to a nett dead weight of 1,593 lbs.; and at three years and  seven months, to 1,316 lbs., with 160 lbs. of rough tallow.    _Description._ The Devon is of medium size, and so symmetrical, as to  appear small. The color is invariably a deep mahogany red, with usually  a white udder and strip under the belly; and the tuft at the end of the  tail is red while they are calves, but white in the older animal. The  head is small, broad in the forehead, and somewhat indented. The muzzle  is delicate, and both the nose and the rings around the eye, in the pure  breed, are invariably of a bright, clear orange. The cheeks and face are  thin and fleshless; the horns clear, smooth, and of a yellowish white,  handsomely curved upward. The neck is small and delicate at its junction  with the head, but is well expanded in its attachment to the breast and  shoulders. The last has the true slant for activity and strength, in  which it excels all other breeds of equal weight. The barrel is round  and deep, with a projecting brisket. The back is broad and level; the  flank full; hips wide; the rumps long; the quarters well developed, and  capable of holding a great quantity of the most valuable meat. The tail  is on a level with the back, and gracefully tapers like a drum-stick, to  the tuft on the end. The legs are of peculiar delicacy and fineness, yet  possess great strength. The skin is of medium thickness, of a rich  orange hue, pliable to the touch, and covered with a thick coating of  fine, soft, curly hair. The Devon is intelligent, gentle, and tractable;  is good for milk, and unsurpassed for the yoke and for fattening. No  animal is better suited to our scanty or luxuriant hill pastures than  the Devon, and none make a better return for the attention and food  received. They ensure a rapid improvement when mixed with other cattle,  imparting their color and characteristics in an eminent degree. Several  importations have been made into this country within the last 30 years,  of the choicest animals, and though not yet numerous in the United  States, we possess some of the best specimens that exist.
