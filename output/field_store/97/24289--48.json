The  tendency for No. 10 to withdraw from the others and from human beings  indicated that she probably was a low-ranking or subordinate animal, a  peripheral member of the pack (Woolpy 1968), or even a lone wolf  currently dispersing from the pack (Mech 1973).    The separation of No. 10 from the others upon release does not  necessarily mean that she was not a member of the pack. No. 10's radio  collar was replaced just before she was released. The handling without  sedation could have frightened her enough that she ran some distance  before the others were even released. The fact that No. 10 returned to  within a half mile (0.8 km) of the release pen on March 20 and to within  less than 100 feet (30.5 m) on April 18 may indicate she was seeking the  other wolves. However, she may also just have used the release pen as a  reference point in a generally unfamiliar area, or may have been  attracted by the remains of carcasses left there.                        Effect of Captivity and Human Contact    The necessary capture, captivity, translocation and contact of the  experimental wolves with humans had an unknown effect on the wolves.  They had been exposed to humans for over 2 months while in captivity. No  attempts were made to tame them, and they never passed the escape stage  of socialization as described by Woolpy and Ginsburg (1967). The  dominant wolves (No. 11 and No. 12) were more relaxed when approached  than were No. 10 and No. 13, however.    The failure of female No. 11 to bear young probably can be attributed to  her captivity and handling. The fact that two couplings were observed  over a 5-day period indicates normal estrus in the female, and a normal  response in the male. Conception would have been expected from such a  mating. In wild wolves, it is known that there is only a small loss  between number of ova shed, number of embryos implanting, and number of  fetuses being carried (Rausch 1967). Thus it seems unlikely that, if No.  11 conceived, she lost her fetuses _in utero_. Rather, she probably did  not conceive, or perhaps the embryos never implanted. This wolf lost  about 11% of her capture weight during captivity, despite an adequate  food supply. This fact, plus the results of her blood tests indicate a  high degree of stress, which probably explains why she never produced  pups.    The possible interference of the drugs used can be ruled out, for they  were chosen because of their known lack of effect on pregnancy (Seal et  al. 1970).    The radio collars placed on the wolves had no noticeable effect on the  animals. Radioed wolves are regularly accepted back into their packs in  Minnesota, where they also reproduce and function normally (Mech and  Frenzel 1971; Mech 1973, 1974).                                      Movements    Environmental Influences    Lake Superior was a barrier to the northward and eastward movements of  the wolves. Apparently it also directed wolves No. 11, 12, and 13  southward around Keweenaw Bay, and possibly it prevented their eastward  movement on April 2 when they approached Keweenaw Bay from the western  side. The Bay is approximately 6-miles (9.6 km) wide there, and was  frozen until late April.    One to two miles (3.2 km) south of the release site, the Huron  Mountains, with an elevation of 1,500 feet (457.5 m) might have  prevented the southward movement of the wolves. Along the lakeshore, the  land is relatively flat, which may have facilitated east-west movement.  Wolves No. 11 and 13 were found at an elevation of 1,300 feet (490 m)  the day after release but had returned to the flat shore areas (600 to  700 feet, or 200 to 230 meters above sea level) by the next day.  Topography likely had effects in other areas but the actual travel  routes, in most instances, are unknown. The pack did travel along an  abandoned railroad grade near Gibbs City and for 2 miles (3.2 km) on a  muddy road north of Kenton. Wolf No. 10 used a railroad bridge to cross  a river in mid-March. It is well known that wolves generally choose the  easiest routes of travel (DeVos 1950, Stenlund 1955, Mech 1966).      Possible Homing Tendencies    Some of the movements of the wolves during the Directional Movements  Phase could in part have resulted from a tendency for the animals to  home, that is to return to their home territory. Packs have been  observed to travel 45 miles (72 km) in 24 hours in Minnesota (Stenlund  1955), Alaska (Burkholder 1959) and on Isle Royale (Mech 1966). In  Minnesota, a radioed wolf was tracked a straight-line distance of 129  miles (208 km) over a 2-month period before being lost by researchers  (Mech and Frenzel 1971), and annual migratory movements of over 200  miles (320 km) have been reported for Canadian wolves (Kuyt 1972).  Therefore it seems within the capabilities of the released wolves to  return the 270-mile (434 km) straight-line distance, or the 340-mile  (547 km) travel distance around Lake Superior to Ray, Minnesota, if the  orientation ability and inclination were present.    Homing tendencies have been reported in wolves and other carnivores. One  of five laboratory-reared wolves returned to her Barrow, Alaska homesite  within about 4 months after a 175-mile (282 km) displacement (Henshaw  and Stephenson 1974). An adult female red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) returned  to her homesite within 12 days after being displaced 35 miles (56.3 km)  (Phillips and Mech 1970). For black bears there are many records of  apparent homing. Harger (1970) displaced 107 adult black bears from 10.0  to 168.5 miles (16.1 to 270.3 km) with an average displacement of 62.5  miles (100.6 km). Thirty-seven of them homed and 11 others moved long  distances toward home. The longest distance homed was 142.5 miles (229.4  km). The return travel routes seemed direct, with little evidence of  wandering or circling. Harger (1970) concluded that bears could navigate  by some means, as yet undetermined.    There is some indication that the pack of three wolves may have  attempted to return home to Minnesota, although it is possible that  exploration itself also may have produced the movement pattern observed.    If the translocated wolves were to try homing directly toward their  previous territory, they would have had to travel west-northwestward.  However, within a few miles they would have encountered Lake Superior.  The next closest choice would have been to head westward, and this is  what the pack did (Fig. 17). The next possible barrier to their homeward  movements would have been Huron Bay, which would have forced them  southwestward, at least temporarily. Again this is what actually  happened. The pack maintained its southwestward movement beyond Huron  Bay until reaching a point southeast of the next possible barrier,  Keweenaw Bay. They then continued westward south of Keweenaw Bay to the  Prickett Dam area, and veered northwestward to Twin Lakes on March 25.    By this time, the wolves had traveled for 13 days and covered a minimum  distance of 59 miles (94.9 km), and they were 42 miles (67.6 km), closer  to home (16% of the straight-line distance between home and release  site). The directions of the movements of the wolves were consistent  with what they would have to be if the wolves were to return home.    However, after March 25, the directionality in the movements of the pack  ended (Fig. 17), and the animals began what we consider the Exploratory  Phase of their movements. If the wolves actually were homing, perhaps  the tendency diminished as they failed to encounter familiar terrain, or  perhaps they met too many obstacles, or became confused after  encountering too much human activity. Or possibly these factors or the  need to find food and security overcame the homing tendency. As  discussed earlier in relation to the unusual number of times the wolves  were observed, it is clear that they were not moving normally during  this period.    The lone wolf, No. 10, dispersed from the release site in as much of an  opposite direction as it could from the pack (Fig. 20). Thus there is no  evidence that this animal was trying to home. However, it is of interest  to note that the first 32 miles (51.5 km) of her travel was directional  rather than random. Furthermore, when the animal encountered what  probably was a psychological barrier, a high concentration of human  activity along Highway 41, she reversed her movements but still  maintained a directionality by returning to the release area. In fact a  striking pattern of southeast-northwest movements characterized this  wolf's travels for several months after her release, with a gradual  westward drift developing in the southeast-northwest movements (Fig.  20).    Mech and Frenzel (1971) found that a wolf dispersing from his former  home range in Minnesota maintained a general southwestward movement for  a straight-line distance of 129 miles (207.6 km) over a 2-month period,  and Mech (unpublished) has three additional records of dispersing wolves  that maintained directionality for distances of 48 to 130 miles (77.2 to  209.2 km). Storm (1972) followed 12 dispersing red foxes in Iowa,  Illinois, and Minnesota that moved directionally for distances of 12 to  110 miles (19.2 to 176.0 km).    The ability of wolves to orient and navigate even in unfamiliar  surroundings was demonstrated dramatically by the separation of Wolf No.  13 from his two packmates and his later rejoining of them. On May 2 he  was 51 miles (82.1 km) away from them. Five days later he and his  packmates were only 6 miles (9.6 km) apart, in an area 62 miles (99.8  km) from where No. 13 had been on May 2, and 45 miles (72.4 km) from  where his packmates were on that date (Fig. 18 and p. 11).    Because No. 13 had taken such a divergent route from that of No. 11 and  12 upon splitting, and then had met them again at a point so far from  (1) where they"]]]
