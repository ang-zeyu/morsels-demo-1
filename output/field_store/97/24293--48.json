The governor  therefore, early in February, ordered the 'Sirius' to prepare for a voyage  to China; and a farther retrenchment of our ration, we were given to  understand, would take place on her sailing.    But the 'Sirius' was destined not to reach China. Previously to her  intended departure on that voyage, she was ordered, in concert with the  'Supply', to convey Major Ross, with a large detachment of marines, and  more than two hundred convicts, to Norfolk Island, it being hoped that  such a division of our numbers would increase the means of subsistence, by  diversified exertions. She sailed on the 6th of March. And on the 27th of  the same month, the following order was issued from headquarters.      Parole--Honour.    Counter sign--Example.    The expected supply of provisions not having arrived, makes it necessary  to reduce the present ration. And the commissary is directed to issue, from  the 1st of April, the under-mentioned allowance, to every person in the  settlement without distinction.    Four pounds of flour, two pounds and a half of salt pork, and one pound and  a half of rice, per week.      On the 5th of April news was brought, that the flag on the South-head was  hoisted. Less emotion was created by the news than might be expected. Every  one coldly said to his neighbour, \"the 'Sirius' and 'Supply' are returned  from Norfolk Island.\" To satisfy myself that the flag was really flying, I  went to the observatory, and looked for it through the large astronomical  telescope, when I plainly saw it. But I was immediately convinced that  it was not to announce the arrival of ships from England; for I could see  nobody near the flagstaff except one solitary being, who kept strolling  around, unmoved by what he saw. I well knew how different an effect the  sight of strange ships would produce.    April, 1790. The governor, however, determined to go down the harbour, and  I begged permission to accompany him. Having turned a point about half way  down, we were surprised to see a boat, which was known to belong to the  'Supply', rowing towards us. On nearer approach, I saw captain Ball make  an extraordinary motion with his hand, which too plainly indicated that  something disastrous had happened; and I could not help turning to the  governor, near whom I sat, and saying, \"Sir, prepare yourself for bad  news.\" A few minutes changed doubt into certainty; and to our unspeakable  consternation we learned, that the 'Sirius' had been wrecked on Norfolk  Island, on the 19th of February. Happily, however, Captain Hunter, and  every other person belonging to her, were saved.    Dismay was painted on every countenance, when the tidings were proclaimed  at Sydney. The most distracting apprehensions were entertained All hopes  were now concentred in the little 'Supply'.    At six o'clock in the evening, all the officers of the garrison, both  civil and military, were summoned to meet the governor in council, when  the nature of our situation was fully discussed and an account of  the provisions yet remaining in store laid before the council by the  commissary. This account stated, that on the present ration* the public  stores contained salt meat sufficient to serve until the 2nd of July, flour  until the 20th of August, and rice, or pease in lieu of it, until the 1st  of October.    [*See the ration of the 27th of March, a few pages back.]    Several regulations for the more effectual preservation of gardens,  and other private property, were proposed, and adopted and after some  interchange of opinion, the following ration was decreed to commence  immediately, a vigorous exertion to prolong existence, or the chance of  relief, being all now left to us.         Two pounds of pork, two pounds and a half of flour,       two pounds of rice, or a quart of pease, per week,       to every grown person, and to every child of more       than eighteen months old.         To every child under eighteen months old, the same       quantity of rice and flour, and one pound of pork.**    [**When the age of this provision is recollected, its inadequacy will more  strikingly appear. The pork and rice were brought with us from England. The  pork had been salted between three and four years, and every grain of rice  was a moving body, from the inhabitants lodged within it. We soon left off  boiling the pork, as it had become so old and dry, that it shrunk one half  in its dimensions when so dressed. Our usual method of cooking it was to  cut off the daily morsel, and toast it on a fork before the fire, catching  the drops which fell on a slice of bread, or in a saucer of rice. Our flour  was the remnant of what was brought from the Cape, by the 'Sirius', and was  good. Instead of baking it, the soldiers and convicts used to boil it up  with greens.]    The immediate departure of the 'Supply', for Batavia, was also determined.    Nor did our zeal stop here. The governor being resolved to employ all  the boats, public and private, in procuring fish--which was intended to  be served in lieu of salt meat--all the officers, civil and military,  including the clergyman, and the surgeons of the hospital, made the  voluntary offer, in addition to their other duties, to go alternately every  night in these boats, in order to see that every exertion was made, and  that all the fish which might be caught was deposited with the commissary.    The best marksmen of the marines and convicts were also selected, and put  under the command of a trusty sergeant, with directions to range the  woods in search of kangaroos, which were ordered, when brought in, to be  delivered to the commissary.    And as it was judged that the inevitable fatigues of shooting and fishing  could not be supported on the common ration, a small additional quantity  of flour and pork was appropriated to the use of the game-keepers; and each  fisherman, who had been out during the preceding night had, on his return  in the morning, a pound of uncleaned fish allowed for his breakfast.    On the 17th instant, the 'Supply', captain Ball, sailed for Batavia. We  followed her with anxious eyes until she was no longer visible. Truly did  we say to her \"In te omnis domus inclinata recumbit.\" We were, however,  consoled by reflecting, that every thing which zeal, fortitude, and  seamanship, could produce, was concentred in her commander.    Our bosoms consequently became less perturbed; and all our labour and  attention were turned on one object--the procuring of food. \"Pride, pomp,  and circumstance of glorious war\" were no more.    The distress of the lower classes for clothes was almost equal to their  other wants. The stores had been long exhausted, and winter was at  hand. Nothing more ludicrous can be conceived than the expedients of  substituting, shifting, and patching, which ingenuity devised, to eke out  wretchedness, and preserve the remains of decency. The superior dexterity  of the women was particularly conspicuous. Many a guard have I seen mount,  in which the number of soldiers without shoes exceeded that which had yet  preserved remnants of leather.    Nor was another part of our domestic economy less whimsical. If a lucky  man, who had knocked down a dinner with his gun, or caught a fish  by angling from the rocks, invited a neighbour to dine with him, the  invitation always ran, \"bring your own bread.\" Even at the governor's  table, this custom was constantly observed. Every man when he sat down  pulled his bread out of his pocket, and laid it by his plate.    The insufficiency of our ration soon diminished our execution of labour.  Both soldiers and convicts pleaded such loss of strength, as to find  themselves unable to perform their accustomed tasks. The hours of public  work were accordingly shortened or, rather, every man was ordered to do as  much as his strength would permit, and every other possible indulgence was  granted.    May, 1790. In proportion, however, as lenity and mitigation were extended  to inability and helplessness, inasmuch was the most rigorous justice  executed on disturbers of the public tranquillity. Persons detected in  robbing gardens, or pilfering provisions, were never screened because, as  every man could possess, by his utmost exertions, but a bare sufficiency to  preserve life*, he who deprived his neighbour of that little, drove him  to desperation. No new laws for the punishment of theft were enacted;  but persons of all descriptions were publicly warned, that the severest  penalties, which the existing law in its greatest latitude would authorise,  should be inflicted on offenders. The following sentence of a court  of justice, of which I was a member, on a convict detected in a garden  stealing potatoes, will illustrate the subject. He was ordered to receive  three hundred lashes immediately, to be chained for six months to two other  criminals, who were thus fettered for former offences, and to have his  allowance of flour stopped for six months. So that during the operation of  the sentence, two pounds of pork, and two pounds of rice (or in lieu of the  latter, a quart of pease) per week, constituted his whole subsistence. Such  was the melancholy length to which we were compelled to stretch our penal  system.    [*Its preservation in some cases was found impracticable. Three or four  instances of persons who perished from want have been related to me. One  only, however, fell within my own observation. I was passing the provision  store, when a man, with a wild haggard countenance, who had just received  his daily pittance to carry home, came out. His faltering gait, and eager  devouring eye, led me to watch him, and he had not proceeded ten steps  before he fell. I ordered him to be carried to the hospital, where, when  he arrived, he was found dead. On opening the body, the cause of death was  pronounced to be inanition.]    Farther to contribute to the detection of villainy, a proclamation,  offering a reward of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35345"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 4, April, 1852 (#8)"],[1,"ning,  and I met him as late as six o'clock this afternoon, passing into the  _Jardin des Plants_.'    \"'God only knows,' I replied. 'Something horrible has suddenly befallen  him.' And I gave an account of what had occurred since Dervilly came to  his rooms. Louis was silent for a moment, and then began to question me  very minutely about him, while Stabb went in to keep watch over the poor  fellow.--Among other things, I mentioned his love affair; and believing  it to be my duty to do so, I told Louis, briefly, all Dervilly had  confided to me. He listened with great attention, and after I had  concluded, we passed into the little chamber where Dervilly lay. He  started up with violence as we came in, as if a severe paroxysm were  about to follow. He stared wildly on seeing Louis, and seizing his hand,  he exclaimed, 'Ah, _mon Professeur_, you are a very great man, and you  are very kind to come to me, but your knowledge avails nothing here,'  touching his forehead. Suddenly he extended his finger, and cried again,  '_La Morgue--La Morgue._'    \"'What see you in _La Morgue_?' said Louis, tenderly.    \"'See? _Her, her!_' screamed Dervilly.    \"'Who, _mon enfant_? said the Professor, very gently.    \"'Who, but the fiend--the fiend! She has my soul--lost, lost for ever.'    \"'You should not speak so harshly of Mademoiselle de Coigny,' continued  Louis, in a soothing tone.    \"'Pronounce not that name: a bait, a trap, a wile of Satan; repeat it,  and I will tear you piecemeal!' cried the maniac.    \"'But, _mon pauvre enfant_, what does she at La Morgue?'    \"'_She?_ the fiend--the fiend--sits perched on the top of the wooden  rail all night, watching--watching--and when some of the corpses show  signs of life, sails down, and sits upon, and strangles them. Keep me  away from there. Ah, _mon Professeur_, do not let me go there, to lie on  the board, and have her bending over me, eyeing me, watching me, ready  to strangle me. There again! keep those glazed eyes away--keep them  away, I say--'    \"All this time Louis was making a minute examination of Dervilly's  symptoms.    \"The latter presently seemed aware of what he was doing, for he  exclaimed, 'The usual symptoms, _eh, mon Professeur_; strongly marked,  _n'est ce pas_? Act promptly and decisively, as you say sometimes. Let  blood--let blood--_appliquez des sangsues_--ha, ha, ha! that's what we  call bleeding, both general and local, ha, ha, ha! then come on with  your cold applications: ice, ice, a mountain of ice piled round about  the head! follow up with cathartics, refrigerant diaphoretics, after  depleting blister!--say you not so?--blisters to the nape of the  neck--blisters behind the ears--shave the scalp--I forgot that--shave  the scalp--strange I had not thought of it,--and the hair. _Mon  Professeur_, I know you will think me very foolish, but--save the  hair--I shan't have another growth--save the hair. Where was I?--ah, the  blisters--that will pretty nearly do for me--keep every thing quiet,  very quiet--after a while, digitalis and nitre--digitalis and nitre,  _mon Professeur_--have I not said my lesson well?'    \"Louis stood perfectly still, regarding the poor fellow with a mournful  interest. As Dervilly paused, he took off his spectacles, and wiped his  eyes. 'Ah, Monsieur Louis, you talk very eloquently about medical  science, but I baffle you; I am sure of it. Call the class  together--_Ah, Notre Dame de Pitie_--call the class together; _voila la  clinique_. Thus being thus, it must necessarily be thus. That's a wise  saying, _mon Professeur_. Call the class together; propound why of  necessity you can do nothing? because of a necessity nothing can be  done. Call the class together; be active--vigorously antiphlogistic;  time is precious--the patient in danger. Purgatives--I doubt as to  purgatives. What think you?' And Dervilly paused, and cast on Louis a  look so naturally inquiring, that the latter replied, as it were,  involuntarily, '_Moi aussi je doute._' And it was so; with all his  genius, all his knowledge, all his experience, and all his skill, the  great practitioner stood, while minute after minute was lost, apparently  hesitating what to do. At last he called me into the other room. 'Is it  not possible to find Mademoiselle de Coigny?' he inquired.    \"'I have no means of knowing where to seek her,' I replied. At the same  time I remembered she was in the habit of visiting the house in which  Dervilly first met her, and fortunately knew the street and number.    \"'Let her be sent for instantly,' said Louis. 'Do not go yourself; you  may be of service here.' Accordingly I gave Stabb the direction, and  instructed him to procure Mademoiselle de Coigny's address, if possible;  but if he were unsuccessful in this, to communicate the fact of  Dervilly's alarming illness, and beg that Mademoiselle might be  immediately summoned.    \"We returned to the sick room, and Louis, seating himself in a chair,  remained lost in thought for nearly a quarter of an hour, while I did  what I could, to pacify the sufferer. I could not help wondering that a  man, so prompt and so efficient, should lose a moment when the least  delay was to be avoided; and as I was reflecting on this, Louis rose so  suddenly from his seat that I was startled. 'There is but one course,  and the poor boy has very accurately defined it. Let his head be shaved,  and pillowed in ice; bleed him at once--if he faints, all the better.'  'No danger of that,' shouted Dervilly. 'No syncope with me but the  _last_ syncope--no syncope--ha, ha, ha! double the ounces--you are  timid--no syncope, I say--' He continued the whole time raving, much in  the manner I have described. The room was kept quite dark, and no one  was permitted to come in. Louis did not leave the bedside the entire  night. Dervilly never slept for an instant. On one occasion he threw  himself close on one side, and screamed, 'Take her away--take her away!'    \"'What is it?' I asked.    \"'Do you not see her?' he shrieked, 'sitting on the bed, looking into my  eyes; take her away, take her away!'    \"I need not detail to you,\" continued Partridge, \"the whole of these  fearful scenes. Late in the evening Stabb returned; he had found the  house; and although he could not obtain Mademoiselle de Coigny's  address, he was promised that his message should be communicated early  in the morning.    \"'It will be too late,' said Louis, mournfully.    \"What a long night it was. The morning dawned at last, but it brought no  change to poor Dervilly. I had sent for his nearest relative, who lived  over on the _Boulevard Poissonniere_, and was awaiting his arrival with  considerable anxiety. It was not later than nine. Stabb, the good  fellow, had relieved me from my watch, and I was in the sitting-room, in  my large arm-chair, still anxious and fearful, when there came a slight  tap at the door; it opened--and Emilie de Coigny stood before me. Ah,  how beautiful she was, yet how terrified! It was not terror of  excitement--mere surface passion--but from the depths of her soul. She  was stirred by intense emotion. 'Tell me,' she said, coming earnestly up  to me, 'tell me where he is, and what has happened to him!' I put my  finger on my lips to prevent her from saying more, and led her to the  further corner of the room; but she would not sit down; she begged to be  told every thing at once; and I, in a low voice, gave Mademoiselle do  Coigny a minute account of all I had witnessed. When I came to  Dervilly's exclamation, '_La Morgue--La Morgue_,' the young girl became  suddenly very pale, her fortitude forsook her, and she murmured faintly,  'He saw me go in--he saw me go in.' I must admit I was, for the moment,  not a little tremulous. I recollected stories of devils taking  possession of the dead bodies of virgins, in order to lure young men to  perdition. I thought of the tale of the German student, who, on retiring  with his bride, beheld her head roll from her body (she had been  guillotined that morning), leaving him wedded to the foul fiend. In  spite of me, I looked on the pale stricken creature before me as in one  way or another connected with the adversary, and holding a commission  from the Prince of the Power of the Air. I had little time for thought  on the subject, for Mademoiselle de Coigny insisted on seeing Dervilly.  I hesitated, but she was decided. She threw aside her pretty straw hat,  and a light shawl, and stepped toward the apartment where her lover lay.  She passed the threshold before he saw her. She called him by his name,  'Alfred.' He turned, and as his eyes fell on her, he uttered mad  exclamations; crouching frantically in the furthest corner of the bed.  'Avaunt,' he screamed; 'vampyre--devil--owl of hell--come no nearer,  (she still advanced, calling to him tenderly); I know that syren voice;  it has damned and double damned me.--Partridge! Stabb! take her away,  or,' he continued, in a fierce tone, 'I will do second execution on  her.'    \"Poor girl--it was too much--she swooned away....    \"You may imagine that it was a terrible scene,\" continued Partridge. \"I  set to work immediately for her recovery, having first carried her out  of the room where Dervilly lay. She opened her eyes at last, but what a  look of anguish was in them! 'Is he better?' she asked in a faint tone.  I shook my head. 'Tell me,' she exclaimed, 'will he die? oh, will he,  _must_ he die?'    \"'He is very sick, Mademoiselle.'    \"'I have killed him, I have killed him,' she cried.    \"'Pardon me', said I, 'Monsieur Dervilly is in great danger; still if we  knew the cause of this dreadful attack we might gain some advantage by  it.'    \"'Ah, it is my work,' murmured the fair mystery to herself, without  heeding my observation; 'I have done it, and if he dies, I am a  murderer--_his_ murderer.' She appeared no way disposed to betray her  secret, and I did not press the subject. Presently Louis came in. He  made his"]]]
