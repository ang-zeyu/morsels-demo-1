In these latter (Fig. 18) the clavicles, fused  together by their lower extremities, form one bone, having the shape of  the letter V or U, which is known as the _fourchette_; this bone, acting  as a true spring, keeps the shoulders apart, and prevents their  approximation during the energetic movements which flight necessitates.    In birds whose power of flight is strong, the two limbs of this bone are  widely separated and thick, and the fourchette is U-shaped. Those whose  flight is awkward and but slightly energetic have the limbs of the  fourchette slender; they unite at a more acute angle, and the bone is V  shaped.    Furthermore, a bone named the _coracoid_ joins the scapula to the  sternum; this bone, often fused with the scapula, where it contributes  to the formation of the glenoid cavity, represents in birds the coracoid  process of the human scapula. If we fancy this process directed  inwards, and sufficiently lengthened to join the sternum, we shall have  an idea of the disposition of the bone we are now discussing, and the  reasons for which the name has been chosen by which it is designated.  The coracoid bone, like the fourchette which it reinforces, offers to  the wings a degree of support proportionate to the efforts developed by  those limbs; for this reason it is thick and solid in birds of powerful  flight.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--SKELETON OF THE SHOULDER OF A BIRD (VULTURE):  ANTERO-EXTERNAL VIEW OF THE LEFT SIDE.    1, Left clavicle; 2, inferior portion of the right clavicle, forming by  its ankylosis with that of the other side the fourchette; 3, coracoid  bone; 4, scapula; 5, articular surface for humerus; 6, superior half of  the sternum; 7, keel of sternum; 8, spinous process of the dorsal  vertebrae; 9, superior ribs; 10, process of one of these ribs; 11,  inferior ribs.]    The superior extremity of each branch of the fourchette, at the level of  its junction with the coracoid and the scapula, bounds, with these  latter, a foramen which gives passage to the tendon of the elevator  muscle of the wing, or small pectoral. The importance of the fourchette  being, as we have seen, in proportion to the movements of flying, it is  easy to understand that the bone is not found in the ostrich.      The Arm    A single bone, the humerus, forms the skeleton of this portion of the  thoracic limb.    =The Humerus.=--The bone of the arm is, in quadrupeds, inclined from  above downwards and from before backwards.    It is, with relation to other regions, short in proportion as the  metacarpus is elongated, and as the number of digits is lessened. In the  horse, for example, whose metacarpus is long, and in which but one digit  is apparent, the humerus is very short. The slight development in length  of the humerus explains its close application to the side of the animal  as far as the elbow.    In animals in which the humerus is longer, the bone is slightly free, as  well as the elbow, at its inferior extremity. Later on we will return to  the consideration of this peculiarity and of the proportions of the  humerus, after we have studied the other parts of the fore-limbs.    The humerus in quadrupeds is inflected like the letter S; in man this  general form is less accentuated, the humerus being almost straight. On  its body, which appears twisted on its own axis, we find the  musculo-spiral groove,[8] which crosses the external surface, and is  very deep in some animals. Above this groove, and on the external  surface, there exists a rough surface which is the impression of the  deltoid. In some species this rugosity is very prominent, and is called  _the tuberosity of the deltoid_; it is prolonged downwards by a border  which forms the anterior crest of the musculo-spiral groove and limits  this latter in front. The external border of the bone, or posterior  crest of the groove, limits it behind.      [8] It would be going outside our province to discuss whether the        humerus is really twisted on its axis. This question, often        discussed, has been solved in some recent works in the following        manner: the humerus has undergone torsion at the level of its        superior extremity, and not at the level of its body; this does        not authorize us further to accord any definite sense to the        denomination 'groove of torsion' (musculo-spiral groove). That        which we must especially remember in connection with this fact,        is, as we shall afterwards see, the difference of direction which        the articular head presents according as the torsion has been more        or less considerable: because this is established, according to        the same order, in man and in quadrupeds.    The superior extremity is enlarged, and remarkable in three portions  which it presents; these are: an articular surface and two tuberosities.    The articular surface, or head of the humerus, smooth and round, is in  contact with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. This head in the human  skeleton is directed upwards and inwards; in quadrupeds its direction is  upwards and backwards. The inferior extremity, having in both one and  the other its long axis directed transversely, and the point of the  elbow looking backwards in all, the result is that the head of the  humerus is not situated vertically above the same regions; in the first,  it is almost directly above the internal part of this extremity; in the  latter, it is situated above its posterior surface, or the point of the  elbow in the complete skeleton. This difference of direction is  correlated with the position of the scapula, the glenoid cavity of  which, as we have already seen, is in man turned outwards, whereas in  quadrupeds it looks downwards. In the latter case the scapula  consequently rests on the head of the humerus; and this position is most  favourable for the performance of the functions which the anterior limbs  have to fulfil in these latter.    Of the tuberosities of the head of the humerus, one is situated on the  external aspect--it is the great tuberosity, or _trochiter_; the other  is placed internally--it is the small tuberosity, or _trochin_. The  great tuberosity is divided into three parts--summit, convexity, and  crest; these different parts give insertion to the muscles of the  shoulder. We recollect that the facets (anterior, middle, and posterior)  of the great tuberosity of the humerus in man give attachment to the  muscles of the same region. The head of the humerus in the human body  projects above the tuberosities. We shall see afterwards, when dealing  with some special quadrupeds, that in some of these, on the other hand,  the tuberosities are on a higher level than the articular head of the  bone. Between the two tuberosities is the bicipital groove.    In man, the superior extremity of the humerus, although covered by the  deltoid, reveals its presence by elevating the corresponding portion of  the latter. In quadrupeds, the anterior part of this extremity, although  similarly covered by muscular bundles, produces a prominence under the  skin. This prominence is situated at the summit of the angle formed by  the opposing directions of the scapula and the bone of the arm, and  constitutes what is known by the name of the _point of the shoulder_, or  of the _point of the arm_.    The inferior extremity, transversely enlarged, presents an undulating  articular surface, which reminds us of the trochlea and the condyle of  the human humerus; on which, however, the condyle is more sharply  defined from the trochlea.    In the human skeleton, the internal lip of the trochlea descends lower  than the external; and also lower than the condyle. In the bear, the  cat, and the dog, it is the same. In the ox and the sheep, the condyle  is lower than the trochlea, but only very little lower. In the horse the  arrangement is still the same, but a little more accentuated.    On the lateral parts of this extremity we find: internally, a  prominence, the epitrochlea; and, externally, another, the epicondyle.  It is from this latter that the crest arises, which, passing upwards,  forms the posterior limit of the groove of torsion.    The two prominences, which we have just described from a general point  of view, present special arrangements which it is necessary to point  out. When we examine the form of the outline of the inferior extremity  of the humerus in man, the bear, the cat, the dog, the ox, and the  horse, we find in following this order that the extremity tends to  become narrow transversely, and that the epicondyle and the epitrochlea  are less and less prominent on the external and internal aspects  respectively. These two processes, indeed, project backwards; the  epitrochlea always remaining more developed than the epicondyle. Because  of this projection backwards, the cavity situated on the posterior  surface of the inferior extremity, the olecranon fossa, is very deep,  more so than in the humerus of man. Its borders being thus formed by the  two processes, are very prominent. In front we find the coronoid fossa,  which is less deep than that of which we have just spoken.    There exists in some mammals an osseous canal, situated above the  epitrochlea, and known as the _supratrochlear canal_ (Fig. 19). It is  bounded by a plate of bone which at its middle portion is detached from  the shaft of the humerus, and blends with the latter at both its  extremities. The brachial artery and median nerve pass through the  foramen.

On he ran until he came to a big river, which hemmed him in on three  sides. The river was too big to cross, so he had to turn back, yet he  did not retrace his steps but turned in another direction. As he turned  to leave the river he saw a flock of emus coming to water. The first  half of the flock were covered with feathers, but the last half had the  form of emus, but no feathers.    Wurrunnah decided to spear one for food. For that purpose he climbed up  a tree, so that they should not see him; he got his spear ready to kill  one of the featherless birds. As they passed by, he picked out the one  he meant to have, threw his spear and killed it, then climbed down to  go and get it.    As he was running up to the dead emu, he saw that they were not emus at  all but black fellows of a strange tribe. They were all standing round  their dead friend making savage signs, as to what they would do by way  of vengeance. Wurrunnah saw that little would avail him the excuse that  he had killed the black fellow in mistake for an emu; his only hope lay  in flight. Once more he took to his heels, hardly daring to look round  for fear he would see an enemy behind him. On he sped, until at last he  reached a camp, which he was almost into before he saw it; he had only  been thinking of danger behind him, unheeding what was before him.    However, he had nothing to fear in the camp he reached so suddenly, for  in it were only seven young girls. They did not look very terrifying,  in fact, seemed more startled than he was. They were quite friendly  towards him when they found that he was alone and hungry. They gave him  food and allowed him to camp there that night. He asked them where the  rest of their tribe were, and what their name was. They answered that  their name was Meamei, and that their tribe were in a far country. They  had only come to this country to see what it was like; they would stay  for a while and thence return whence they had come.    The next day Wurrunnah made a fresh start, and left the camp of the  Meamei, as if he were leaving for good. But he determined to hide near  and watch what they did, and if he could get a chance he would steal a  wife from amongst them. He was tired of travelling alone. He saw the  seven sisters all start out with their yam sticks in hand. He followed  at a distance, taking care not to be seen. He saw them stop by the  nests of some flying ants. With their yam sticks they dug all round  these ant holes. When they had successfully unearthed the ants they sat  down, throwing their yam sticks on one side, to enjoy a feast, for  these ants were esteemed by them a great delicacy.    While the sisters were busy at their feast, Wurrunnah sneaked up to  their yam sticks and stole two of them; then, taking the sticks with  him, sneaked back to his hiding-place. When at length the Meamei had  satisfied their appetites, they picked up their sticks and turned  towards their camp again. But only five could find their sticks; so  those five started off, leaving the other two to find theirs, supposing  they must be somewhere near, and, finding them, they would soon catch  them up. The two girls hunted all round the ants' nests, but could find  no sticks. At last, when their backs were turned towards him, Wurrunnah  crept out and stuck the lost yam sticks near together in the ground;  then he slipt back into his hiding-place. When the two girls turned  round, there in front of them they saw their sticks. With a cry of  joyful surprise they ran to them and caught hold of them to pull them  out of the ground, in which they were firmly stuck. As they were doing  so, out from his hiding-place jumped Wurrunnah. He seized both girls  round their waists, holding them tightly. They struggled and screamed,  but to no purpose. There were none near to hear them, and the more they  struggled the tighter Wurrunnah held them. Finding their screams and  struggles in vain they quietened at length, and then Wurrunnah told  them not to be afraid, he would take care of them. He was lonely, he  said, and wanted two wives. They must come quietly with him, and he  would be good to them. But they must do as he told them. If they were  not quiet, he would swiftly quieten them with his moorillah. But if  they would come quietly with him he would be good to them. Seeing that  resistance was useless, the two young girls complied with his wish, and  travelled quietly on with him. They told him that some day their tribe  would come and steal them back again; to avoid which he travelled  quickly on and on still further, hoping to elude all pursuit. Some  weeks passed, and, outwardly, the two Meamei seemed settled down to  their new life, and quite content in it, though when they were alone  together they often talked of their sisters, and wondered what they had  done when they realised their loss. They wondered if the five were  still hunting for them, or whether they had gone back to their tribe to  get assistance. That they might be in time forgotten and left with  Wurrunnali for ever, they never once for a moment thought. One day when  they were camped Wurrunnah said: \"This fire will not burn well. Go you  two and get some bark from those two pine trees over there.\"    \"No,\" they said, \"we must not cut pine bark. If we did, you would never  more see us.\"    \"Go! I tell you, cut pine bark. I want it. See you not the fire burns  but slowly?\"    \"If we go, Wurrunnah, we shall never return. You will see us no more in  this country. We know it.\"    \"Go, women, stay not to talk. Did ye ever see talk make a fire burn?  Then why stand ye there talking? Go; do as I bid you. Talk not so  foolishly; if you ran away soon should I catch you, and, catching you,  would beat you hard. Go I talk no more.\"    The Meamei went, taking with them their combos with which to cut the  bark. They went each to a different tree, and each, with a strong hit,  drove her combo into the bark. As she did so, each felt the tree that  her combo had struck rising higher out of the ground and bearing her  upward with it. Higher and higher grew the pine trees, and still on  them, higher and higher from the earth, went the two girls. Hearing no  chopping after the first hits, Wurrunnah came towards the pines to see  what was keeping the girls so long. As he came near them he saw that  the pine trees were growing taller even as he looked at them, and  clinging to the trunks of the trees high in the air he saw his two  wives. He called to them to come down, but they made no answer. Time  after time he called to them as higher and higher they went, but still  they made no answer. Steadily taller grew the two pines, until at last  their tops touched the sky. As they did so, from the sky the five  Meamei looked out, called to their two sisters on the pine trees,  bidding them not to be afraid but to come to them. Quickly the two  girls climbed up when they heard the voices of their sisters. When they  reached the tops of the pines the five sisters in the sky stretched  forth their hands, and drew them in to live with them there in the sky  for ever.    And there, if you look, you may see the seven sisters together. You  perhaps know them as the Pleiades, but the black fellows call them the  Meamei.          11.  THE COOKOOBURRAHS AND THE GOOLAHGOOL      Googarh, the iguana, was married to Moodai, the opossum and  Cookooburrah, the laughing jackass. Cookooburrah was the mother of  three sons, one grown up and living away from her, the other two only  little boys. They had their camps near a goolahgool, whence they  obtained water. A goolahgool is a water-holding tree, of the iron bark  or box species. It is a tree with a split in the fork of it, and hollow  below the fork. After heavy rain, this hollow trunk would be full of  water, which water would have run into it through the split in the  fork. A goolahgool would hold water for a long time. The blacks knew a  goolahgool, amongst other trees, by the mark which the overflow of  water made down the trunk of the tree, discolouring the bark.    One day, Googarh, the iguana, and his two wives went out hunting,  leaving the two little Cookooburrahs at the camp. They had taken out  water for themselves in their opossum skin water bags, but they had  left none for the children, who were too small to get any from the  goolahgool for themselves, so nearly perished from thirst. Their  tongues were swollen in their mouths, and they were quite speechless,  when they saw a man coming towards them. When he came near, they saw it  was Cookooburrah, their big brother. They could not speak to him and  answer, when he asked where his mother was. Then he asked them what was  the matter. All they could do was to point towards the tree. He looked  at it, and saw it was a goolahgool, so he said: \"Did your mother leave  you no water?\" They shook their heads. He said: \"Then you are perishing  for want of a drink, my brothers?\" They nodded. \"Go,\" he said \"a little  way off, and you shall see how I will punish them for leaving my little  brothers to perish of thirst.\" He went towards the tree, climbed up it,  and split it right down. As he did so, out gushed the water in a  swiftly running stream. Soon the little fellows quenched their thirst  and then, in their joy, bathed in the water, which grew in volume every  moment.    In the meantime, those who had gone forth to hunt were returning, and  as they came towards their camp they met a running stream of water.  \"What is this?\" they said, \"our goolahgool must have burst,\" and they  tried to dam the water, but it was running too strongly for them. They  gave up the effort and hurried on towards their camp. But they found a  deep stream divided them from their camp. The three Cookooburrahs saw  them, and the eldest one said to the little fellows: \"You call out and  tell them to cross down there, where it is not deep.\" The little ones  called out as they"]]]
