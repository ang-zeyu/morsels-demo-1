In manipulation of form music can achieve results which are  beyond the reach of painting. On the other hand, painting is  ahead of music in several particulars. Music, for example, has at  its disposal duration of time; while painting can present to the  spectator the whole content of its message at one moment.  [Footnote: These statements of difference are, of course,  relative; for music can on occasions dispense with extension of  time, and painting make use of it.] Music, which is outwardly  unfettered by nature, needs no definite form for its expression.    [Footnote: How miserably music fails when attempting to express  material appearances is proved by the affected absurdity of  programme music. Quite lately such experiments have been made.  The imitation in sound of croaking frogs, of farmyard noises, of  household duties, makes an excellent music hall turn and is  amusing enough. But in serious music such attempts are merely  warnings against any imitation of nature. Nature has her own  language, and a powerful one; this language cannot be imitated.  The sound of a farmyard in music is never successfully  reproduced, and is unnecessary waste of time. The Stimmung of  nature can be imparted by every art, not, however, by imitation,  but by the artistic divination of its inner spirit.]    Painting today is almost exclusively concerned with the  reproduction of natural forms and phenomena. Her business is now  to test her strength and methods, to know herself as music has  done for a long time, and then to use her powers to a truly  artistic end.    And so the arts are encroaching one upon another, and from a  proper use of this encroachment will rise the art that is truly  monumental. Every man who steeps himself in the spiritual  possibilities of his art is a valuable helper in the building of  the spiritual pyramid which will some day reach to heaven.        PART II: ABOUT PAINTING        V. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WORKING OF COLOUR        To let the eye stray over a palette, splashed with many colours,  produces a dual result. In the first place one receives a PURELY  PHYSICAL IMPRESSION, one of pleasure and contentment at the  varied and beautiful colours. The eye is either warmed or else  soothed and cooled. But these physical sensations can only be of  short duration. They are merely superficial and leave no lasting  impression, for the soul is unaffected. But although the effect  of the colours is forgotten when the eye is turned away, the  superficial impression of varied colour may be the starting point  of a whole chain of related sensations.    On the average man only the impressions caused by very familiar  objects, will be purely superficial. A first encounter with any  new phenomenon exercises immediately an impression on the soul.  This is the experience of the child discovering the world, to  whom every object is new. He sees a light, wishes to take hold of  it, burns his finger and feels henceforward a proper respect for  flame. But later he learns that light has a friendly as well as  an unfriendly side, that it drives away the darkness, makes the  day longer, is essential to warmth, cooking, play-acting. From  the mass of these discoveries is composed a knowledge of light,  which is indelibly fixed in his mind. The strong, intensive  interest disappears and the various properties of flame are  balanced against each other. In this way the whole world becomes  gradually disenchanted. It is realized that trees give shade,  that horses run fast and motor-cars still faster, that dogs bite,  that the figure seen in a mirror is not a real human being.    As the man develops, the circle of these experiences caused by  different beings and objects, grows ever wider. They acquire an  inner meaning and eventually a spiritual harmony. It is the same  with colour, which makes only a momentary and superficial  impression on a soul but slightly developed in sensitiveness. But  even this superficial impression varies in quality. The eye is  strongly attracted by light, clear colours, and still more  strongly attracted by those colours which are warm as well as  clear; vermilion has the charm of flame, which has always  attracted human beings. Keen lemon-yellow hurts the eye in time  as a prolonged and shrill trumpet-note the ear, and the gazer  turns away to seek relief in blue or green.    But to a more sensitive soul the effect of colours is deeper and  intensely moving. And so we come to the second main result of  looking at colours: THEIR PSYCHIC EFFECT. They produce a  corresponding spiritual vibration, and it is only as a step  towards this spiritual vibration that the elementary physical  impression is of importance.    Whether the psychic effect of colour is a direct one, as these last few  lines imply, or whether it is the outcome of association, is perhaps  open to question. The soul being one with the body, the former may well  experience a psychic shock, caused by association acting on the latter.  For example, red may cause a sensation analogous to that caused by  flame, because red is the colour of flame. A warm red will prove  exciting, another shade of red will cause pain or disgust through  association with running blood. In these cases colour awakens a  corresponding physical sensation, which undoubtedly works upon the soul.    If this were always the case, it would be easy to define by  association the effects of colour upon other senses than that of  sight. One might say that keen yellow looks sour, because it  recalls the taste of a lemon.    But such definitions are not universally possible. There are many  examples of colour working which refuse to be so classified. A  Dresden doctor relates of one of his patients, whom he designates  as an \"exceptionally sensitive person,\" that he could not eat a  certain sauce without tasting \"blue,\" i.e. without experiencing a  feeling of seeing a blue color. [Footnote: Dr. Freudenberg.  \"Spaltung der Personlichkeit\" (Ubersinnliche Welt. 1908. No. 2,  p. 64-65). The author also discusses the hearing of colour, and  says that here also no rules can be laid down. But cf. L.  Sabanejeff in \"Musik,\" Moscow, 1911, No. 9, where the imminent  possibility of laying down a law is clearly hinted at.] It would  be possible to suggest, by way of explanation of this, that in  highly sensitive people, the way to the soul is so direct and the  soul itself so impressionable, that any impression of taste  communicates itself immediately to the soul, and thence to the  other organs of sense (in this case, the eyes). This would imply  an echo or reverberation, such as occurs sometimes in musical  instruments which, without being touched, sound in harmony with  some other instrument struck at the moment.    But not only with taste has sight been known to work in harmony.  Many colours have been described as rough or sticky, others as  smooth and uniform, so that one feels inclined to stroke them  (e.g., dark ultramarine, chromic oxide green, and rose madder).  Equally the distinction between warm and cold colours belongs to  this connection. Some colours appear soft (rose madder), others  hard (cobalt green, blue-green oxide), so that even fresh from  the tube they seem to be dry.    The expression \"scented colours\" is frequently met with. And  finally the sound of colours is so definite that it would be hard  to find anyone who would try to express bright yellow in the bass  notes, or dark lake in the treble.    [Footnote: Much theory and practice have been devoted to this  question. People have sought to paint in counterpoint. Also  unmusical children have been successfully helped to play the  piano by quoting a parallel in colour (e.g., of flowers). On  these lines Frau A. Sacharjin-Unkowsky has worked for several  years and has evolved a method of \"so describing sounds by  natural colours, and colours by natural sounds, that colour could  be heard and sound seen.\" The system has proved successful for  several years both in the inventor's own school and the  Conservatoire at St. Petersburg. Finally Scriabin, on more  spiritual lines, has paralleled sound and colours in a chart not  unlike that of Frau Unkowsky. In \"Prometheus\" he has given  convincing proof of his theories. (His chart appeared in \"Musik,\"  Moscow, 1911, No. 9.)]    [Footnote: The converse question, i.e. the colour of sound, was  touched upon by Mallarme and systematized by his disciple Rene  Ghil, whose book, Traite du Verbe, gives the rules for  \"l'instrumentation verbale.\"--M.T.H.S.]    The explanation by association will not suffice us in many, and  the most important cases. Those who have heard of chromotherapy  will know that coloured light can exercise very definite  influences on the whole body. Attempts have been made with  different colours in the treatment of various nervous ailments.  They have shown that red light stimulates and excites the heart,  while blue light can cause temporary paralysis. But when the  experiments come to be tried on animals and even plants, the  association theory falls to the ground. So one is bound to admit  that the question is at present unexplored, but that colour can  exercise enormous influence over the body as a physical organism.    No more sufficient, in the psychic sphere, is the theory of  association. Generally speaking, colour is a power which directly  influences the soul. Colour is the keyboard, the eyes are the  hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is  the hand which plays, touching one key or another, to cause  vibrations in the soul.    IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT COLOUR HARMONY MUST REST ONLY ON A  CORRESPONDING VIBRATION IN THE HUMAN SOUL; AND THIS IS ONE OF THE  GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE INNER NEED.    [Footnote: The phrase \"inner need\" (innere Notwendigkeit) means  primarily the impulse felt by the artist for spiritual  expression. Kandinsky is apt, however, to use the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/533"],[0,"The Song of the Cardinal (#8)"],[1," had  felt small.  The crushing possibility that somewhere there might be a  cardinal that was larger, brighter, and a finer musician than he,  staggered him; and worst of all, his voice broke suddenly to his  complete embarrassment.    Half screened by the flowers, she seemed so little, so shy, so  delightfully sweet.  He \"chipped\" carefully once or twice to steady  himself and clear his throat, for unaccountably it had grown dry and  husky; and then he tenderly tried again.  \"Come here! Come here!\"  implored the Cardinal.  He forgot all about his dignity.  He knew that  his voice was trembling with eagerness and hoarse with fear.  He was  afraid to attempt approaching her, but he leaned toward her, begging  and pleading.  He teased and insisted, and he did not care a particle  if he did.  It suddenly seemed an honour to coax her.  He rocked on the  limb.  He side-stepped and hopped and gyrated gracefully.  He fluffed  and flirted and showed himself to every advantage.  It never occurred  to him that the dove and the woodpecker might be watching, though he  would not have cared in the least if they had been; and as for any  other cardinal, he would have attacked the combined forces of the  Limberlost and Rainbow Bottom.    He sang and sang.  Every impulse of passion in his big, crimson,  palpitating body was thrown into those notes; but she only turned her  head from side to side, peering at him, seeming sufficiently frightened  to flee at a breath, and answered not even the faintest little \"Chook!\"  of encouragement.    The Cardinal rested a second before he tried again.  That steadied him  and gave him better command of himself.  He could tell that his notes  were clearing and growing sweeter.  He was improving.  Perhaps she was  interested.  There was some encouragement in the fact that she was  still there.  The Cardinal felt that his time had come.    \"Come here! Come here!\" He was on his mettle now.  Surely no cardinal  could sing fuller, clearer, sweeter notes! He began at the very first,  and rollicked through a story of adventure, colouring it with every  wild, dashing, catchy note he could improvise.  He followed that with a  rippling song of the joy and fulness of spring, in notes as light and  airy as the wind-blown soul of melody, and with swaying body kept time  to his rhythmic measures.  Then he glided into a song of love, and  tenderly, pleadingly, passionately, told the story as only a courting  bird can tell it.  Then he sang a song of ravishment; a song quavering  with fear and the pain tugging at his heart.  He almost had run the  gamut, and she really appeared as if she intended to flee rather than  to come to him.  He was afraid to take even one timid little hop toward  her.    In a fit of desperation the Cardinal burst into the passion song.    He arose to his full height, leaned toward her with outspread quivering  wings, and crest flared to the utmost, and rocking from side to side in  the intensity of his fervour, he poured out a perfect torrent of  palpitant song.  His cardinal body swayed to the rolling flood of his  ecstatic tones, until he appeared like a flaming pulsing note of  materialized music, as he entreated, coaxed, commanded, and pled.  From  sheer exhaustion, he threw up his head to round off the last note he  could utter, and breathlessly glancing down to see if she were coming,  caught sight of a faint streak of gray in the distance. He had planned  so to subdue the little female he courted that she would come to him;  he was in hot pursuit a half day's journey away before he remembered it.    No other cardinal ever endured such a chase as she led him in the  following days.  Through fear and timidity she had kept most of her  life in the underbrush.  The Cardinal was a bird of the open fields and  tree-tops.  He loved to rock with the wind, and speed arrow-like in  great plunges of flight.  This darting and twisting over logs, among  leaves, and through tangled thickets, tired, tried, and exasperated him  more than hundreds of miles of open flight.  Sometimes he drove her  from cover, and then she wildly dashed up-hill and down-dale, seeking  another thicket; but wherever she went, the Cardinal was only a breath  behind her, and with every passing mile his passion for her grew.    There was no time to eat, bathe, or sing; only mile after mile of  unceasing pursuit.  It seemed that the little creature could not stop  if she would, and as for the Cardinal, he was in that chase to remain  until his last heart-beat.  It was a question how the frightened bird  kept in advance.  She was visibly the worse for this ardent courtship.  Two tail feathers were gone, and there was a broken one beating from  her wing.  Once she had flown too low, striking her head against a rail  until a drop of blood came, and she cried pitifully.  Several times the  Cardinal had cornered her, and tried to hold her by a bunch of  feathers, and compel her by force to listen to reason; but she only  broke from his hold and dashed away a stricken thing, leaving him half  dead with longing and remorse.    But no matter how baffled she grew, or where she fled in her headlong  flight, the one thing she always remembered, was not to lead the  Cardinal into the punishment that awaited him in Rainbow Bottom.  Panting for breath, quivering with fear, longing for well-concealed  retreats, worn and half blinded by the disasters of flight through  strange country, the tired bird beat her aimless way; but she would  have been torn to pieces before she would have led her magnificent  pursuer into the wrath of his enemies.    Poor little feathered creature!  She had been fleeing some kind of  danger all her life.  She could not realize that love and protection  had come in this splendid guise, and she fled on and on.    Once the Cardinal, aching with passion and love, fell behind that she  might rest, and before he realized that another bird was close, an  impudent big relative of his, straying from the Limberlost, entered the  race and pursued her so hotly that with a note of utter panic she  wheeled and darted back to the Cardinal for protection.  When to the  rush of rage that possessed him at the sight of a rival was added the  knowledge that she was seeking him in her extremity, such a mighty wave  of anger swept the Cardinal that he appeared twice his real size.  Like  a flaming brand of vengeance he struck that Limberlost upstart, and  sent him rolling to earth, a mass of battered feathers.  With beak and  claw he made his attack, and when he so utterly demolished his rival  that he hopped away trembling, with dishevelled plumage stained with  his own blood, the Cardinal remembered his little love and hastened  back, confidently hoping for his reward.    She was so securely hidden, that although he went searching, calling,  pleading, he found no trace of her the remainder of that day.  The  Cardinal almost went distracted; and his tender imploring cries would  have moved any except a panic-stricken bird.  He did not even know in  what direction to pursue her.  Night closed down, and found him in a  fever of love-sick fear, but it brought rest and wisdom.  She could not  have gone very far.  She was too worn.  He would not proclaim his  presence.  Soon she would suffer past enduring for food and water.    He hid in the willows close where he had lost her, and waited with what  patience he could; and it was a wise plan.  Shortly after dawn, moving  stilly as the break of day, trembling with fear, she came slipping to  the river for a drink.  It was almost brutal cruelty, but her fear must  be overcome someway; and with a cry of triumph the Cardinal, in a  plunge of flight, was beside her.  She gave him one stricken look, and  dashed away.  The chase began once more and continued until she was  visibly breaking.    There was no room for a rival that morning.  The Cardinal flew abreast  of her and gave her a caress or attempted a kiss whenever he found the  slightest chance.  She was almost worn out, her flights were wavering  and growing shorter.  The Cardinal did his utmost.  If she paused to  rest, he crept close as he dared, and piteously begged: \"Come here!  Come here!\"    When she took wing, he so dexterously intercepted her course that  several time she found refuge in his sumac without realizing where she  was.  When she did that, he perched just as closely as he dared; and  while they both rested, he sang to her a soft little whispered love  song, deep in his throat; and with every note he gently edged nearer.  She turned her head from him, and although she was panting for breath  and palpitant with fear, the Cardinal knew that he dared not go closer,  or she would dash away like the wild thing she was.  The next time she  took wing, she found him so persistently in her course that she turned  sharply and fled panting to the sumac.  When this had happened so often  that she seemed to recognize the sumac as a place of refuge, the  Cardinal slipped aside and spent all his remaining breath in an  exultant whistle of triumph, for now he was beginning to see his way.  He dashed into mid-air, and with a gyration that would have done credit  to a flycatcher, he snapped up a gadfly that should have been more  alert.    With a tender \"Chip!\" from branch to branch, slowly, cautiously, he  came with it.  Because he was half starved himself, he knew that she  must be almost famished.  Holding it where she could see, he hopped  toward her, eagerly, carefully, the gadfly in his beak, his heart in  his mouth.  He stretched his neck and legs to the limit as he reached  the fly toward her.  What matter that she took it with a snap, and  plunged a quarter of a mile before eating it?  She had taken food from  him!  That was the beginning.  Cautiously he impelled her toward the  sumac, and with untiring patience kept her there the remainder of the  day.  He carried her every choice morsel he could find in the"]]]
