Some of those who have seen him declare  that he is as big as three ordinary wolves; but my father, who has  caught sight of him several times, says that this is an exaggeration,  though he is by far the largest wolf he ever saw. He is lighter in  colour than other wolves, but those who saw him years ago say that  this was not the case then, and that his light colour must be due  to his great age.\"    The party now started, under the guidance of the forester, to the  spot where he had seen the wolf enter the underwood.    It was the head of a narrow valley. The sides which inclosed it  sloped steeply, but not too much so for the wolf to climb. During  the last halt the marquis had arranged the plan of action. He  himself, with three of the most experienced huntsmen, took their  stations across the valley, which was but seventy or eighty yards  wide. Eight of the others were to dismount and take post on either  side of the ravine.    \"I am sorry, gentlemen, that I cannot find posts for the rest of  you, but you may have your share of the work. Over and over again  this wolf has slipped away when we thought we had him surrounded,  and what he has done before he may do again. Therefore, let each of  you take up such a position as he thinks best outside our circle,  but keeping well behind trees or other shelter, so as to cover  himself from any random shot that may be fired after the wolf. Do  you, on your part, fire only when the wolf has passed your line,  or you may hit some of us.\"    The two lads were naturally among those left out from the inner  circle.    \"What do you think, Ernest; shall we remain on our horses here in  the valley or climb the hills?\"    \"I should say wait here, Harry; in the first place, because it  is the least trouble, and in the second, because I think he is as  likely to come this way as any other. At any rate we may as well  dismount here, and let horses crop that piece of fresh grass until  we hear the horn that will tell us when the dogs have been turned  into the thicket to drive him out.\"    It was half an hour before they heard the distant note of the horn.    \"They have begun,\" Ernest exclaimed; \"we had better mount at once.  If the brute is still there he is just as likely, being such an  old hand at the sport, to make a bolt at once, instead of waiting  until the dogs are close to him.\"    \"What are we to do if we see him?\" Harry asked.    \"We are to shoot him if we can. If we miss him, or he glides past  before we can get a shot, we must follow shouting, so as to guide  the rest as to the direction he is taking.\"    \"My chance of hitting him is not great,\" Harry said. \"I am not a  very good shot even on my feet; but sitting in my saddle I do not  think it likely I should get anywhere near him.\"    A quarter of an hour passed. The occasional note of a dog and the  shouts of the men encouraging them to work their way through the  dense thicket could be heard, but no sound of a shot met their  ears.    \"Either he is not there at all, or he is lying very close,\" Ernest  said.    \"Look, look!\" Harry said suddenly, pointing through the trees to  the right.    \"That is the wolf, sure enough,\" Ernest exclaimed. \"Come along.\"    The two lads spurred their horses and rode recklessly through the  trees towards the great gray beast, who seemed to flit like a shadow  past them.    \"Mind the boughs, Ernest, or you will be swept from your saddle.  Hurrah! The trees are more open in front.\"    But although the horses were going at the top of their speed they  scarcely seemed to gain on the wolf, who, as it seemed to them,  kept his distance ahead without any great exertion.    \"We shall never catch him,\" Harry exclaimed after they had ridden  for nearly half an hour, and the laboured panting of the horses  showed that they could not long maintain the pace.    Suddenly, ten yards ahead of the wolf, a man, armed with  a hatchet, stepped out from behind a tree directly in its way. He  was a wood-cutter whose attention being called by the sound of the  galloping feet of the horses, had left his half-hewn tree and stepped  out to see who was coming. He gave an exclamation of surprise and  alarm as he saw the wolf, and raised his hatchet to defend himself.  Without a moment's hesitation the animal sprang upon him and  carried him to the ground, fixing its fangs into his throat. There  was a struggle for a few moments, and then the wolf left its lifeless  foe and was about to continue its flight.    \"Get ready to fire, Harry,\" Ernest exclaimed as the wolf sprang  upon the man, \"it is our last chance. If he gets away now we shall  never catch him.\"    They reined in their horses just as the wolf rose to fly. Harry  fired first, but the movement of his panting horse deranged his aim  and the bullet flew wide. More accustomed to firing on horseback,  Ernest's aim was truer, he struck the wolf on the shoulder, and  it rolled over and over. With a shout of triumph the boys dashed  forward, but when they were within a few paces the wolf leapt  to its feet and endeavoured to spring towards them. Harry's horse  wheeled aside so sharply that he was hurled from the saddle.    The shock was a severe one, and before he could rise to his  feet the wolf was close upon him. He tried as he rose to draw his  hunting-sword, but before he could do so,  Ernest, who had, when he  saw him fall, at once leaped from his horse, threw himself before  him, and dealt the wolf a severe blow on the head with his weapon.    Furious with rage and pain the wolf sprang upon him and seized  him by the shoulder. Ernest dropped his sword, and drawing his  hunting-knife struck at it, while at the same moment Harry ran it  through the body.    So strong and tenacious of life was the animal that the blows  were repeated several times before it loosed its hold of Ernest's  shoulder and fell dead.    \"Are you hurt, my dear Ernest?\" was Harry's first exclamation.    \"Oh, never mind that, that's nothing,\" Ernest replied. \"Only think,  Harry, you and I have killed the demon wolf, and no else had a hand  in it. There is a triumph for us.\"    \"The triumph is yours, Ernest,\" Harry said. \"He would have got away  had you not stopped him with your bullet, and he would have made  short work of me had you not come to my rescue, for I was half  stunned with the fall, and he would have done for me as quickly as  he did for that poor fellow there.\"    \"That is true, Harry, but it was you who gave him his mortal wound.  He would have mastered me otherwise. He was too strong for me, and  would have borne me to the ground. No, it's a joint business, and  we have both a right to be proud of it. Now let us fasten him on my  horse; but before we do that, you must bind up my shoulder somehow.  In spite of my thick doublet he has bit me very sharply. But first  let us see to this poor fellow. I fear he is dead.\"    It was soon seen that nothing could be done for the woodman, who  had been killed almost instantly. Harry, therefore, proceeded to  cut off Ernest's coat-sleeve and bathed the wound. The flesh was  badly torn, and the arm was so useless that he thought that some  bones were broken. Having done his best to bandage the wound,  he strapped the arm firmly across the body, so as to prevent its  being shaken by the motion of the riding. It was with the greatest  difficulty that they were able to lift the body of the wolf, but  could not lay it across the horse, as the animal plunged and kicked  and refused to allow it to be brought near. Ernest was able to  assist but little, for now that the excitement was over he felt  faint and sick with the pain of his wound.    \"I think you had better ride off, Harry, and bring some one to our  assistance. I will wait here till you come back.\"    \"I don't like to do that,\" Harry said. \"They must be seven or eight  miles away, and I may not be able to find them. They may have moved  away to some other part of the forest. Ah! I have an idea!  Suppose  I cut a pole, tie the wolf's legs together and put the pole through  them; then we can hoist the pole up and lash its ends behind the  two saddles. The horses may not mind so much if it's not put upon  their backs.\"      \"That might do,\" Ernest agreed; \"but you mustn't make the pole more  than six or seven feet long, or we shall have difficulty in riding  between the trees.\"    The pole was soon cut and the wolf in readiness to be lifted, but  the horses still refused to stand steady.    \"Blindfold them, Harry,\" Ernest said suddenly, \"and tie them up to  two trees a few feet apart.\"    This was soon done, and the boys then patted and soothed them until  they became quiet. The pole was now lifted, and this time they  managed to lay it across the saddles and to lash it securely to  the cantles. Then they mounted, and taking the bandages off the  horses' eyes set out on their way. The horses were fidgety at first,  but presently fell into a quiet walk.    For upwards of an hour they heard nothing of the huntsmen.  Not a  sound broke the stillness of the forest; the sun was shining through  the leafless trees, and they were therefore enabled to shape their  course in the direction in which  they had come. Presently they  heard the sound of a shot, followed by several others, and then  the bay of hounds. The sound came from their left.    \"They have been trying a fresh place,\" Ernest said, \"and I expect  they have come upon two wolves; one they have shot, the hounds are  after the other.\"    They turned their horses' heads in the direction of the sounds,  and presently Harry said:    \"They are coming this way.\"    Louder and louder grew the sounds of the chase; then the deep tones  of the hounds were exchanged for a fierce angry barking.    \"The wolf is at bay!\" Ernest exclaimed.    A minute later some notes were sounded on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#8)"],[1,"its sporting  chance on light tackle constitute the ethical soul of angling. The  fisherman who stops fishing when he has a few specimens is angling;  he's an Angler. The fisherman who fishes with no limit in his catch is  merely fishing; he's a fisherman, not an Angler.    Any picture of a few fishes may illustrate the catch of the Angler,  and the photograph on Frontispiece shows the catch of the worst type  of fisherman--the wanton fish exterminator who, ignoring the Angler's  gentle law, takes his greedy mess because it is according to the  so-called legal law.    Dr. William T. Hornaday, author of _Wild Life Conservation_, _The  American Natural History_, _Our Vanishing Wild Life_, etc., and  director of the New York Zooelogical Park, has sent me the photograph  of the greedyman's catch--made near Spokane, Washington--with the  following notes:    \"The great trouble [in the matter of wasteful fish-catching] is not so  much with the people who catch fish as with the brutally destructive  laws that permit fishermen to catch four or five times as many fish as  they should. There are a great many sportsmen who sincerely believe  that it is all right to take all the fish and game of all kinds that  the law allows. Whenever any destruction is waged on that basis I  always charge it to the abominably liberal laws that in many cases  seemed framed to promote destruction. Ninety-nine per cent. of the  streams of this country very soon will be so nearly destitute of fish  that fishing will become a lost art. In the Rocky Mountains the  overfishing abuse is particularly vicious and destructive because in  those cold streams the fish mature slowly, their food is very scarce  and dear, and the fish are so hungry that they are easily caught. It  is an easy matter to completely fish out a mountain stream in the  Rocky Mountain region or in the Pacific States. In the State of  Wyoming some very aggravated cases of wanton fish destruction by  indifferent rod and line fishermen have lately been brought to my  attention.\"    Dr. Hornaday is an Angler, and his views and practices are endorsed by  all Anglers. His great book on wild life conservation is brimful of  practical detail and should be in the library of all who are  interested in the preservation of our fishes, birds, and quadruped  game. Here is a sample of the Doctor's vigorous style in his admirable  campaign against the exterminator:    \"A few years ago, certain interests in Pennsylvania raised a great  public outcry against the alleged awful destruction of fish in the  streams of Pennsylvania by herons.... A little later on, however, the  game commissioners found that the herons remaining in Pennsylvania  were far too few to constitute a pest to fish life, and furthermore,  the millinery interests appeared to be behind the movement. Under the  new law the milliners were enabled to reopen in Pennsylvania the sale  of aigrettes, because those feathers came from members of the  unprotected Heron Family! It required a tremendous State campaign to  restore protection to the herons and bar out the aigrettes; but it was  accomplished in 1912. Hereafter, let no man for one moment be deceived  by the claim that the very few-and-far-between herons, bitterns, and  kingfishers that now remain in the United States, anywhere, are such a  menace to fish life that those birds are a pest and deserve to be  shot. The inland streams of the United States and Canada lack fishes  because they have been outrageously overfished,--wastefully, wickedly  depleted, without sense or reason, by men who scorn the idea of  conservation. In Orleans County, New York, a case was reported to me  of a farmer who dynamited the waters of his own creek, in spawning  time!\"    The Angler angles according to his own humanely conservative law. The  greedy fisherman fishes according to court or so-called legal law,  good or bad, and he always breaks the Angler's law and very often the  court's law.    In viewing Dr. Hornaday's Spokane photograph note the bait-casting  reel on the fly-casting rod--the rig of a clumsy as well as greedy  fisherman. The mess of trout shown is one that no Angler would ever  make and one that any gentleman would be ashamed of--\"three times too  many fish for one rod,\" as Dr. Hornaday says, \"another line of  extermination according to law.\" Of course, the Doctor means the  fisherman's law or the court's law, not the Angler's law.          CHAPTER VII    FLY-FISHING FOR TROUT    \"The variety of rivers require different ways of angling.\"--IZAAK  WALTON, _The Compleat Angler_.      The art of catching fish with artificial lures in imitation of natural  insects is the most chivalric of all methods of angling.    Fish, particularly trout, often hook themselves when they seize the  fly of a fisherman using a pliant rod that will yield and spring  freely. As the game strikes, the Angler strikes, hooking the fish  swiftly but delicately by a simple turn of the wrist. The trout is not  flaunted up in the air by force, as some coarse perch fishermen lift  their catch. The trout fisher does not use his arm at all in hooking a  trout beyond aiding the hand in holding the rod for the wrist to do  the work. A practiced troutman can secure his fish by moving his hand  five inches--a little backward nervous twist of the wrist.    Trout often snap a fly and spit it out so quickly that the tyro does  not have a chance to strike and hook the prize. At other times they  take hold more slowly, and afford the beginner more opportunity to  hook them, and, as I have said, they very often hook themselves.    The beginner will have some trouble in overcoming the excitement or  \"trout fever\" that always accompanies the trout's rise and strike, but  experience will gradually make him more calm and active at this  important moment. The tyro trout fisher is often more frightened at  the rise of the trout than he would be at the flush of a noisy grouse  or the springing of a surprised deer.    When you have hooked the fish, always handle him as if he were but  lightly secured. Do not attempt to lift him out or yank him up to you.  Keep the line gently taut, and softly lead the prize out of rough  water or away from stones, grasses, logs, or tree branches. Do not let  him come to the surface until he is pretty well exhausted and you are  about to put him in the landing-net. If he is a large fish, tow him  ashore if the water edge will permit. Where there are overhanging  banks this cannot be done. Do not be in a hurry to get him out of the  water. Be calm and work carefully.    If the fish is large enough to overcome the reel click and run off the  line, let him do so, but check him and guide him according to any  obstruction there may be.    When he has rushed here and there for some little time with his mouth  open and with a constant check--the line should always be taut--he  will become tired, and when he is tired he will not rush. Then softly  reel him in, being careful not to let him come in contact with a stone  or weed, which is sure to arouse him again. Reel him up quickly,  without making a splashing swoop, and he will soon grace your creel.    Several persons have expressed an objection to a list of flies I once  named, saying a good Angler might kill just as many trout on quarter  the number.    Any Angler can take even less than one quarter of the enumerated list  and catch fully as many brook trout as one who might use all of the  flies mentioned--if he can pick out the ones the trout are rising to  without trying them all until he discovers the killing ones. A chef  might please his master with one or two of the forty courses billed,  if he knew what the man wanted.    Sometimes an Angler can judge the appropriate fly to use by observing  nature in seeing trout rise to the live fly; but, there are times when  trout are not rising, times when they are tired of the fly upon the  water, and times when the real fly is not on the wing. Then the Angler  is expected to take matters in his own hands and whip about quietly  until he discovers the proper patterns. It is better to try for the  right flies with a list of twenty-nine than whip over a list of a  thousand or more. I have learned from experience that trout, like  human beings, are in love with a variety of foods at different times.  Their tastes change with the months, the weeks, the days, the hours,  and, under certain conditions which I will presently explain, the  minutes.    \"... fish will not bite constantly, nor every day. They have  peculiar, unexplainable moods that continuing favoring conditions of  water, wind, and weather cannot control\" (Eugene McCarthy, _Familiar  Fish_).    When I mention twenty-nine different patterns as being seasonable at a  stated period, I do not mean to say that the trout will rise to them  all and at any time and under all conditions. In the first place, the  person using them might be a tyro unfamiliar with the gentle art, the  streams might be dried up, there might be an earthquake, the flies  might be too large, too coarse, and for that matter a thousand other  conditions might interfere. I fish dozens of streams in different  localities several times every month during the legal season, and I  have been a fond Angler--if not a skillful one--since my tenth  birthday. Experience on the streams, a true love for nature, and a  careful attention to my notebook enable me to separate the artificial  flies into monthly lists. No man can class them into weekly or daily  lots.    \"When a fly is said to be in season it does not follow that it is  abroad on every day of its existence\" (Alfred Ronalds).    The Eastern gentleman who said if he could have but one fly he would  take a yellow one, is probably a good Angler, for a yellow fly is a  fair choice. If I could have but one fly I should take a--ah! I cannot  name its color; 'tis the quaker, a cream, buff, grayish, honey-yellow  shade.    Beaverkill, Seth"]]]
