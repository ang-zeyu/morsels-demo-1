Does it mean if you do not build the  Temple at the END of the appointment? That would be absurd. It means,  if you do not perform your baptisms for your dead and the ordinances  for the dead at the end--not the beginning, but the end--of the  appointment, then will you be rejected with your dead. So you see  it was not the failure to finish the attic, or to carve figures in  the woodwork, or embellish the building by placing pictures on the  walls, or painting them; it was not for this that the Church was to  be rejected; but it was to be rejected with its dead if it failed to  perform the work in the Temple for the dead when the opportunity was  afforded. Now let us see if this view is not in harmony with other  Scriptures. I turn to the second section of the Doctrine and Covenants.  Here the angel says:        \"Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of      Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day      of the Lord.        \"And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made      to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their      fathers.        \"If it were not so, the whole earth would be UTTERLY WASTED AT ITS      COMING.\"    Why would the earth be wasted? Simply because if there is not a welding  link between the fathers and the children--which is the work for the  dead--then we will all stand rejected; the whole work of God will fail  and be utterly wasted. Such a condition of course, shall not be. When  Elijah restored this Priesthood, he said that the time spoken of had  fully come, and that the dreadful day of the Lord was near, even at the  doors.    Let us now see what Joseph Smith had to say in relation to this.  Speaking of the baptism and salvation for the dead, he said:        \"The GREATEST RESPONSIBILITY in this world that God has laid upon      us, is to seek after our dead. The apostle says they without us      cannot be made perfect. Now I will speak of them: I say to you,      Paul, you cannot be perfect without us; it is necessary that those      who have gone before, and those who come after us should have      salvation in common with us, and thus hath God made it OBLIGATORY      to man. Hence God said He would send Elijah.\" (Times and Seasons,      6:616).    Moreover, at the conference held October, 1841, to which I have already  referred, the prophet said this:        \"Baptism for the dead is the only way that men can appear as      saviors on Mount Zion. The proclamation of the first principles of      the gospel was a means of salvation to men individually, and it was      the truth, not men, that saved them; but men by actively engaging      in rites of salvation _substitutionally_, become instrumental in      bringing multitudes of their kin into the Kingdom of God.\"        \"This doctrine\"--that is, baptism for the dead--\"he said, presents      in a clear light the wisdom and mercy of God, in preparing an      ordinance for the salvation of the dead, being baptized by proxy,      their names recorded in heaven, and they judged according to the      deeds done in the body.\"    Now here comes the most important statement.        --\"This doctrine was the BURDEN OF THE SCRIPTURES. Those Saints      who NEGLECT it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at the      PERIL OF THEIR OWN SALVATION.\"    There we have the key to the whole situation. If we neglect the  salvation of our dead when we have the opportunity to save them, then  we ourselves will be rejected, and that is just what the revelation of  January 19, 1841, says. In the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 128,  verse 5, we are told that baptism for the dead was prepared from before  the foundation of the world, \"for the salvation of the dead,\" mark  this, \"WHO SHOULD DIE WITHOUT A KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOSPEL!\" And in verse  15:        \"And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure you      that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living      that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation,      as Paul says concerning the fathers, 'that they without us cannot      be made perfect, neither can we without our dead be made perfect.'\"    Here we have it in this revelation that if we do not save our dead we  cannot ourselves be saved, therefore if we neglect their salvation, we  ourselves will be rejected. Now verse 18:        \"It is sufficient to know * * * that the earth will be smitten      with a curse, UNLESS there is a welding link of some kind or      other, between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or      other, and behold what is that subject? IT IS THE BAPTISM FOR THE      DEAD. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they      without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made perfect      without those who have died in the Gospel also; for it is necessary      in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulnesss of times,      which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and      complete and perfect union and welding together of dispensations,      and keys, and powers, and glories, should take place, and be      revealed, from the days of Adam even to the present time; and not      only this, but those things which never have been revealed from      the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise      and prudent shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this the      dispensation of the fulness of times.\"      SALVATION FOR THE DEAD IMPORTANT.    Now, is it not plain to see how important this doctrine is, and why  the Saints were to be rejected? But they were not rejected for they  performed the baptisms for their dead, and are today performing the  baptisms and the ordinances for and in behalf of their dead. Therefore  they are not rejected. Again, the Prophet says that the Saints have not  too much time to save and redeem their dead, and gather their living  relatives together that they may be saved also, before the earth will  be smitten, as revealed by Malachi. Therefore it is quite evident why  the Lord permitted them to baptize in the river, and not wait until  those ordinances could be performed in the Temple, and why He was so  anxious that they should hurry and prepare a place in the Temple, where  they could be performed in accordance with the plan from before the  foundation of the world.    Here is another statement that I wish to refer to. In an editorial  in the Times and Seasons written by the Prophet, in volume 3, pages  759-761, where he is speaking of the remarks made by the Savior to the  Jews, that upon them should come all the righteous blood shed upon the  earth from the blood of righteous Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias,  son of Barachias, who was slain between the Temple and the altar,  Joseph the Prophet declares in most emphatic terms that the reason why  this blood was to come upon these Jews was, that:        \"They possessed greater privileges than any other generation, not      only as pertaining to themselves but to their dead, their sin was      greater as they not only neglected their own salvation but that      of their progenitors, and hence their blood was required at their      hands.\"    Now, if these Jews were to answer for the blood of their progenitors  because they neglected the salvation of their dead, then, may we not  ask; will not we have to answer for the blood of our dead if we neglect  these ordinances in their behalf? It matters not even if we have been  baptized and have had hands laid on our heads for the reception of the  Holy Ghost; if we wilfully neglect the salvation of our dead, then also  we shall stand rejected of the Lord because we have rejected our dead;  and just so sure their blood will be required at our hands.    Now, what is the attitude of the \"Reorganized\" Church in relation to  the salvation of the dead, the neglect of which the Church--yes, and  also the individual--was to stand rejected of the Lord? I have here a  copy of a resolution that was passed by the general conference of that  sect in 1886, at the time that Mr. Briggs withdrew. This resolution  is in reply to his charge that he could not accept the principle of  \"baptism for the dead.\" Here it is:        \"That as to the alleged Temple building and ceremonial endowments      therein, that we know of no Temple building, except as edifices      wherein to worship God, and no endowment except the endowment of      the Holy Spirit of the kind experienced by the early Saints on      Pentecost day.\"        \"'Baptism for the dead' referred to belongs to those local      questions of which the body has said by resolution:        \"'That the commandments of a local character, given to the first      organization of the Church are binding on the Reorganization only      so far as they are either reiterated or referred to as binding by      commandment to this church. And _that_ principle has neither been      reiterated nor referred to as a commandment.\"    Just think of that! They declare that we were rejected because we  failed to build a house where these ordinances were to be performed,  and yet they actually have the audacity to say that the work of  salvation for the dead is not binding on them because it has not  been reiterated or referred to as a commandment binding on them.  Now is that consistent? They call it a local commandment, yet we  have seen that this commandment was the burden of the Scriptures and  the greatest responsibility that God has placed upon us, and we are  obliged to save our dead if we would ourselves be saved. And yet, this  commandment without which the whole earth was to be utterly wasted and  destroyed--this eternal commandment that had been prepared before the  foundation of the world--is not binding on them! \"A local commandment!\"  \"A permissive rite!\" My friends, from the teachings of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#8)"],[1,"free enterprise economy of our country. It  is competition that keeps it free. It is competition that keeps it growing  and developing. The truth is that we need far more competition in the  future than we have had in the immediate past.    By strangling competition, monopolistic activity prevents or deters  investment in new or expanded production facilities. This lessens the  opportunity for employment and chokes off new outlets for idle savings.  Monopoly maintains prices at artificially high levels and reduces  consumption which, with lower prices, would rise and support larger  production and higher employment. Monopoly, not being subject to  competitive pressure, is slow to take advantage of technical advances which  would lower prices or improve quality. All three of these monopolistic  activities very directly lower the standard of living--through higher  prices and lower quality of product--which free competition would improve.    The Federal Government must protect legitimate business and consumers from  predatory and monopolistic practices by the vigilant enforcement of  regulatory legislation. The program will be designed to have a maximum  impact upon monopolistic bottlenecks and unfair competitive practices  hindering expansion in employment.    During the war, enforcement of antimonopoly laws was suspended in a number  of fields. The Government must now take major steps not only to maintain  enforcement of antitrust laws but to encourage new and competing  enterprises in every way. The deferred demand of the war years and the  large accumulations of liquid assets provide ample incentive for expansion.  Equalizing of business opportunity, under full and free competition, must  be a prime responsibility in the reconversion period and in the years that  follow. Many leading businessmen have recognized the importance of such  action both to themselves and to the economy as a whole.    But we must do more than break up trusts and monopolies after they have  begun to strangle competition. We must take positive action to foster new,  expanding enterprises. By legislation and by administration we must take  specific steps to discourage the formation or the strengthening of  competition-restricting business. We must have an over-all antimonopoly  policy which can be applied by all agencies of the Government in exercising  the functions assigned to them--a policy designed to encourage the  formation and growth of new and freely competitive enterprises.    Among the many departments and agencies which have parts in the program  affecting business and competition, the Department of Commerce has a  particularly important role. That is why I have recommended a substantial  increase in appropriations for the next fiscal year for this Department.    In its assistance to industry, the Department of Commerce will concentrate  its efforts on these primary objectives: Promotion of a large and  well-balanced foreign trade; provision of improved technical assistance and  management aids, especially for small enterprises; and strengthening of  basic statistics on business operations, both by industries and by regions.  To make new inventions and discoveries available more promptly to all  businesses, small and large, the Department proposes to expand its own  research activities, promote research by universities, improve Patent  Office procedures, and develop a greatly expanded system of field offices  readily accessible to the businesses they serve.    Many gaps exist in the private financial mechanism, especially in the  provision of long-term funds for small- and medium sized enterprises. In  the peacetime economy the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will take the  leadership in assuring adequate financing for small enterprises which  cannot secure funds from other sources. Most of the funds should and will  be provided by private lenders; but the Reconstruction Finance Corporation  will share any unusual risks through guarantees of private loans, with  direct loans only when private capital is unwilling to participate on a  reasonable basis.    (e) Minimum wage.    Full employment and full production may be achieved only by maintaining a  level of consumer income far higher than that of the prewar period. A high  level of consumer income will maintain the market for the output of our  mills, farms, and factories, which we have demonstrated during the war  years that we can produce. One of the basic steps which the Congress can  take to establish a high level of consumer income is to amend the Fair  Labor Standards Act to raise substandard wages to a decent minimum and to  extend similar protection to additional workers who are not covered by the  present act.    Substandard wages are bad for business and for the farmer. Substandard  wages provide only a substandard market for the goods and services produced  by American industry and agriculture.    At the present time the Fair Labor Standards Act prescribes a minimum wage  of 40 cents an hour for those workers who are covered by the act. The  present minimum wage represents an annual income of about $800 to those  continuously employed for 50 weeks--clearly a wholly inadequate budget for  an American family. I am in full accord with the proposal now pending in  the Congress that the statutory minimum be raised immediately to 65 cents  an hour, with further increases to 70 cents after one year and to 75 cents  after two years. I also favor the proposal that the industry committee  procedure be used to set rates higher than 65 cents per hour during the  two-year interval before the 75-cent basic wage would otherwise become  applicable.    The proposed minimum wage of 65 cents an hour would assure the worker an  annual income of about $1,300 a year in steady employment. This amount is  clearly a modest goal. After considering cost-of-living increases in recent  years, it is little more than a 10-cent increase over the present legal  minimum. In fact, if any large number of workers earn less than this  amount, we will find it impossible to maintain the levels of purchasing  power needed to sustain the stable prosperity which we desire. Raising the  minimum to 75 cents an hour will provide the wage earner with an annual  income of $1,500 if he is fully employed.    The proposed higher minimum wage levels are feasible without involving  serious price adjustments or serious geographic dislocations.    Today about 20 percent of our manufacturing wage earners--or about 2  million-earn less than 65 cents an hour. Because wages in most industries  have risen during the war, this is about the same as the proportion-17  percent--who were earning less than 40 cents an hour in 1941.    I also recommend that minimum wage protection be extended to several groups  of workers not now covered. The need for a decent standard of living is by  no means limited to those workers who happen to be covered by the act as it  now stands. It is particularly vital at this period of readjustment in the  national economy and readjustment in employment of labor to extend minimum  wage protection as far as possible.    Lifting the basic minimum wage is necessary, it is justified as a matter of  simple equity to workers, and it will prove not only feasible but also  directly beneficial to the Nation's employers.    (f) Agricultural programs.    The farmers of America generally are entering the crop year of 1946 in  better financial condition than ever before. Farm mortgage debt is the  lowest in 30 years. Farmers' savings are the largest in history. Our  agricultural plant is in much better condition than after World War I. Farm  machinery and supplies are expected to be available in larger volume, and  farm labor problems will be less acute.    The demand for farm products will continue strong during the next year or  two because domestic purchases will be supplemented by a high level of  exports and foreign relief shipments. It is currently estimated that from 7  to 10 percent of the total United States food supply may be exported in the  calendar year 1946.    Farm prices are expected to remain at least at their present levels in the  immediate future, and for at least the next 12 months they are expected to  yield a net farm income double the 1935-39 average and higher than in any  year prior to 1943.    We can look to the future of agriculture with greater confidence than in  many a year in the past. Agriculture itself is moving confidently ahead,  planning for another year of big production, taking definite and positive  steps to lead the way toward an economy of abundance.    Agricultural production goals for 1946 call for somewhat greater acreage  than actually was planted in 1945. Agriculture is prepared to demonstrate  that it can make a peacetime contribution as great as its contribution  toward the winning of the war.    In spite of supplying our armed forces and our allies during the war with a  fifth to a fourth of our total food output, farmers were still able to  provide our civilians with 8 percent more food per capita than the average  for the five years preceding the war. Since the surrender of Japan,  civilian food consumption has risen still further. By the end of 1945 the  amount of the increase in food consumption was estimated to be as high as  15 percent over the prewar average. The record shows that the people of  this country want and need more food and that they will buy more food if  only they have the jobs and the purchasing power. The first essential  therefore in providing fully for the welfare of agriculture is to maintain  full employment and a high level of purchasing power throughout the  Nation.    For the period immediately ahead we shall still have the problem of  supplying enough food. If we are to do our part in aiding the war-stricken  and starving countries some of the food desires of our own people will not  be completely satisfied, at least until"]]]
