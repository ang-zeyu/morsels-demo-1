I  took my gun and visited the mules in rotation till 2:30. Then J. B.  awoke, chattering with cold, but determined, and kept faithful guard  until 5, when we began our day with a water-bucket frozen solid.    All our property remained safe, and a distant fire twinkling in the  brush showed that our neighbors were still there. After breakfast Oscar  again sought the hostile camp, and finally found a scared and innocent  Frenchman, who cried out, on recognizing his visitor:    \"Holy Mary! I took you for American robbers from the line, and I have  lain awake all night, watching my horses.\"    From Agua Blanca we drove across the Santa Catarina ranch, for the most  part plain and mesa, covered with greasewood and buckbrush. This latter  shrub looks much like sage, except that its leaves are of a yellow-green  instead of a blue-green. It is said to furnish the chief nutrition for  stock on several great ranches. Certainly there was no visible grass,  but buckbrush can hardly be fattening. Toward night, we crossed the pass  into the Trinidad Valley and drove down a grade not steep only, but  sidelong, where the wagons both went tobogganing down and slid rapidly  toward the gulch. The mules held well, however, and before dark we were  camped near the hot spring at the house of Alvarez.    Our friend, Don Manuel Murillo, had recommended us both to Alvarez and  to his sister, Senora Paula, but both of these were absent. Don Manuel  had also urged us to get the Indian Anastasio for a guide.    \"For heaven's sake,\" he said, \"don't venture without a guide. You may  perish from thirst, as others have done before you.\"    We tried at first to hire burros and let our mules rest, but the Indian  who owned the burros stated that his terms were \"one burro, one day, one  dollar\"--an impudent attempt at robbery, which we resented.    We interviewed Anastasio, however, who said he would start at any  moment; and, leaving Oscar to guard the wagon, we packed two mules,  saddled two more for J. B. and myself, and, giving Anastasio the  tow-rope of a pack-mule, we started after him. Anastasio was the most  interesting figure of the trip, and I must be pardoned if I go into some  detail about him. He spoke some Spanish and understood a good deal. When  he did not understand, he never stated that fact, but either assumed a  stony look or answered at cross-purposes; so that we did not get to know  a great deal about each other for some time.    He had, too, a lingering remnant of the distrust of horses and mules  that his ancestors must have felt in Spanish times, and when his  pack-mule got a stone in her hoof, he observed it with anxiety from a  distance, but could not summon resolution to meddle with so serious a  matter.    Moreover his measure of distance was primitive. I would ask, for  instance, how many miles it was to our next stop. He might say three  miles for an all-day journey of six times that length, or he might tell  you that we were nine miles from a spot which we reached in half an  hour.    I then substituted leagues for miles, thinking that the Mexican usage  would be more familiar to him; but at last Anastasio said, rather  impatiently, that all this business of leagues and miles was rather  confusing and outside of his experience. We would reach the next water  shortly before sunset, and that was all the calculation he was  accustomed to, and quite close enough.    Aside from his knowledge of Spanish, Anastasio was indeed a fine  representative of the best of the stone age, and as we journeyed on, one  got an excellent idea of the life of the savage here in early times.  About 3 o'clock in the afternoon, we reached the only water spot on the  trail. Anastasio parted some withered reeds, and, looking earnestly,  said, \"Dry.\" A short distance further up, he repeated the word, and yet  again, till, at his fourth attempt, he said, \"Very little,\" and we  camped. By scraping away the mud and grass, we got a small gravelly  hole, and dipped out the slowly seeping water, a cup at a time. We thus  managed to give each of the mules a little in a pan, and to get a  canteen full for cooking.    Then I noticed Anastasio gathering wood, which I thought at first was  for general use, but I found it was a private pile, to be used, so to  speak, for bedding. Anastasio did not take the ax to secure his wood,  but smashed off mesquite branches with a rock or pulled out some old  root. He quite despised pinon and juniper logs, saying they gave no  heat--meaning, probably, that they burned out too soon.    We turned in soon after supper, and the night was cold. Anastasio said  he feared snow. The reason for his fear was soon evident. My bed was  about twenty feet from Anastasio's, and during the night I would turn  and watch him. He carried but one small blanket of about the texture of  a gunny sack. He lighted a long smouldering fire, stripped himself  naked, except a breech-clout, and, with his back to the coals and his  front protected by his gauzy blanket, he slept until the cold roused  him, when he put on more wood and slept again. I offered him four pairs  of warm horse blankets to sleep in, but that was not the thing. He said  that he needed to have the fire strike him in the small of the back, and  that he slept in that way always. So throughout the night, in my wakeful  moments, I saw the light reflected from his mahogany person. Evidently  snow or cold rain would be disastrous to people who need a fire all  night; for, with no covering against the cold and with fires  extinguished by storm, they might easily freeze to death.    We were packed and marching at 7:30 next morning, and to those who know  the inwardness of packing in winter, that statement means a good deal.  It means, for instance, that J. B. got up, at my summons, long before  dawn and cooked a splendid breakfast, and that the mules were caught and  grained and saddled, and the packs made and lashed, by the earliest  sun.    J. B. was a wonder. He seemed to enjoy giving his fellow mortals the  best breakfasts and suppers--for we never had any midday meals--that our  supplies could furnish. Always rising at the first call, in the dark,  sometimes with an accompaniment of snow or rain, he managed the  commissariat to perfection.    I in my humble way packed and saddled and did other necessary work, and  Anastasio regarded us with benevolent curiosity, though always ready to  get wood or water or mules when we asked him to do so.    We were now approaching the true desert. This term is not restricted to  the broad level sand wastes along the Gulf, but includes the arid and  waterless mountains adjacent, and this must be borne in mind when the  Mexicans tell you that sheep are to be found in the desert.    We passed the last of the brushy hills, and, crossing a small divide,  came over slopes of volcanic cinders to a little water spot with dwarf  willows and grass. This was our hunting camp. The country through which  our route had lain heretofore was altogether granitic, though one could  see hills apparently of stratified material in the distance. Toward the  desert, we met beds of conglomerate and trachyte, and mountains covered  with slide-rock, ringing flint-like clinkers from some great volcanic  furnace. But doubtless some accurate and industrious German has  described all this, in a work on the geology of the peninsula, and to  that valuable treatise I will refer you for further facts.    The vegetation had somewhat changed. There were more cactuses,  particularly the fleshy kind called venaga, though I noticed with  surprise the absence of the great fruit-bearing cactuses, the saguarro  and pitaya, all along our route. The Spanish daggers were very numerous,  as were also mescal plants, both of these forming veritable thickets in  places.    The venaga cactus is similar to the bisnaga, found in other parts of  Mexico, except in the disposition and curvature of the thorns. They are  stumpy plants, growing from a foot to three feet or so in height, and a  foot or more in diameter, like a thickset post. Those of us who  delighted in Mayne Reid's \"Boy Hunters\" will remember how the  adventurous young men saved themselves from dying of thirst by laying  open these succulent cactuses with their long hunting knives and  drinking the abundant juices. I have often and faithfully tried to  perform the same feat, out of reverence for my heroes, but failed to  find anything juicier than, say, a raw turnip--by no means satisfying as  a drink. The venagas are found on the mountains where sheep haunt, with  their hard prickly rinds broken and the interior hollowed out, and  Anastasio said that the sheep do this by knocking holes in the cactus  with their horns and then eating the inside.    This cactus country makes the third variety of wilderness encountered in  the peninsula. There are four: first, and best, the pine barrens;  second, the brushy hills and plains, covered with sage, greasewood and  buckweed; third, this spike-bearing volcanic region; and fourth, the  appalling desolation of the acknowledged desert.    The moment we had unloaded and watered our animals, Anastasio and I set  out to look for deer. Anastasio wore the spotted and tattered remnant of  a frock-coat, once green, given him by an Englishman, of whom I shall  say more later. He had guarachis, or sandals, on his feet, bare legs, a  breech-clout, and on his head a reddish bandanna handkerchief in the  last stages of decay; and as he peered over some rock, glaring long and  earnestly in search of game, he reminded one of those lean and wolfish  Apaches that Remington draws in a way so dramatic and so full of grim  significance.    Anastasio was fifty-one years old and had no upper incisors, but the way  he flung his gaunt leathern shanks over those mountains of volcanic  clinkers, armed with the poisoned bayonets of myriads of mescal, cactus  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37206"],[0,"Sea and Sardinia (#8)"],[1,"the tin  altar. Surely it had been made deliberately so that we should not eat  it! The Cagliarese young woman talked to us. Yes, she broke into that  awful language which the Italians--the quite ordinary ones--call  French, and which they insist on speaking for their own glorification:  yea, when they get to heaven's gate they will ask St. Peter for:    \"OOn bigliay pour ung--trozzieme classe.\"    Fortunately or unfortunately her inquisitiveness got the better of her,  and she fell into her native Italian. What were we, where did we come  from, where were we going, _why_ were we going, had we any children, did  we want any, etc. After every answer she nodded her head and said Ahu!  and watched us with energetic dark eyes. Then she ruminated over our  nationalities and said, to the unseeing witnesses: Una bella coppia, a  fine couple. As at the moment we felt neither beautiful nor coupled, we  only looked greener. The grim man-at-arms coming up to ask us again if  we weren't going to have a little wine, she lapsed into her ten-pounder  French, which was most difficult to follow. And she said that on a  sea-voyage one must eat, one must eat, if only a little. But--and she  lapsed into Italian--one must by no means drink wine--no--no! One didn't  want to, said I sadly. Whereupon the grim man-at-arms, whom, of course,  we had cheated out of the bottle we refused to have opened for us, said  with a lost sarcasm that wine made a man of a man, etc., etc. I was too  weary of that underground, however. All I knew was that he wanted wine,  wine, wine, and we hadn't ordered any. He didn't care for food.    The Cagliarese told us she came now from Naples, and her husband was  following in a few days. He was doing business in Naples. I nearly asked  if he was a little dog-fish--this being the Italian for profiteer, but  refrained in time. So the two ladies retired to lie down, I went and sat  under my tarpaulin.           *       *       *       *       *    I felt very dim, and only a bit of myself. And I dozed blankly. The  afternoon grew more sunny. The ship turned southwards, and with the wind  and waves behind, it became much warmer, much smoother. The sun had the  lovely strong winey warmth, golden over the dark-blue sea. The old  oak-wood looked almost white, the afternoon was sweet upon the sea. And  in the sunshine and the swishing of the sea, the speedier running of the  empty ship, I slept a warm, sweet hour away, and awoke new. To see ahead  pale, uplooming islands upon the right: the windy Egades: and on the  right a mountain or high conical hill, with buildings on the summit: and  in front against the sea, still rather far away, buildings rising upon a  quay, within a harbor: and a mole, and a castle forward to sea, all  small and far away, like a view. The buildings were square and fine.  There was something impressive--magical under the far sunshine and the  keen wind, the square and well-proportioned buildings waiting far off,  waiting like a lost city in a story, a Rip van Winkle city. I knew it  was Trapani, the western port of Sicily, under the western sun.           *       *       *       *       *    And the hill near us was Mount Eryx. I had never seen it before. So I  had imagined a mountain in the sky. But it was only a hill, with  undistinguishable cluster of a village on the summit, where even now  cold wisps of vapour caught. They say it is 2,500 feet high. Still it  looks only a hill.    But why in the name of heaven should my heart stand still as I watch  that hill which rises above the sea? It is the Etna of the west: but  only a town-crowned hill. To men it must have had a magic almost greater  than Etna's. Watching Africa! Africa, showing her coast on clear days.  Africa the dreaded. And the great watch-temple of the summit,  world-sacred, world-mystic in the world that was. Venus of the  aborigines, older than Greek Aphrodite. Venus of the aborigines, from  her watch-temple looking at Africa, beyond the Egatian isles. The  world-mystery, the smiling Astarte. This, one of the world centres,  older than old! and the woman-goddess watching Africa! _Erycina  ridens._ Laughing, the woman-goddess, at this centre of an ancient,  quite-lost world.    I confess my heart stood still. But is mere historical fact so strong,  that what one learns in bits from books can move one so? Or does the  very word call an echo out of the dark blood? It seems so to me. It  seems to me from the darkest recesses of my blood comes a terrible echo  at the name of Mount Eryx: something quite unaccountable. The name of  Athens hardly moves me. At Eryx--my darkness quivers. Eryx, looking west  into Africa's sunset. _Erycina ridens._    There is a tick-tocking in the little cabin against which I lean. The  wireless operator is busy communicating with Trapani, no doubt. He is a  fat young man with fairish curly hair and an important bearing. Give a  man control of some machine, and at once his air of importance and  more-than-human dignity develops. One of the unaccountable members of  the crew lounges in the little doorway, like a chicken on one foot,  having nothing to do. The girl from Cagliari comes up with two young  men--also Sardinians by their thick-set, independent look, and the touch  of pride in their dark eyes. She has no wraps at all: just her elegant  fine-cloth dress, her bare head from which the wisps of hair blow across  her brow, and the transparent \"nigger\" silk stockings. Yet she does not  seem cold. She talks with great animation, sitting between the two  young men. And she holds the hand of the one in the overcoat  affectionately. She is always holding the hand of one or other of the  two young men: and wiping wisps of wind-blown hair from her brow: and  talking in her strong, nonchalant voice, rapidly, ceaselessly, with  massive energy. Heaven knows if the two young men--they are third-class  passengers--were previous acquaintances. But they hold her hand like  brothers--quite simply and nicely, not at all sticky and libidinous. It  all has an air of \"Why not?\"    She shouts at me as I pass, in her powerful, extraordinary French:    \"Madame votre femme, elle est au lit?\"    I say she is lying down.    \"Ah!\" she nods. \"Elle a le mal de mer?\"    No, she is not sea-sick, just lying down.    The two young men, between whom she is sitting as between two pillows,  watch with the curious Sardinian dark eyes that seem alert and show the  white all round. They are pleasant--a bit like seals. And they have a  numb look for the moment, impressed by this strange language. She  proceeds energetically to translate into Sardinian, as I pass on.    We do not seem to be going to Trapani. There lies the town on the left,  under the hill, the square buildings that suggest to me the factories  of the East India Company shining in the sun along the curious,  closed-in harbour, beyond the running, dark blue sea. We seem to be  making for the island bulk of Levanzo. Perhaps we shall steer away to  Sardinia without putting in to Trapani.    On and on we run--and always as if we were going to steer between the  pale blue, heaped-up islands, leaving Trapani behind us on our left. The  town has been in sight for an hour or more: and still we run out to sea  towards Levanzo. And the wireless-operator busily tick-tocks and throbs  in his little cabin on this upper deck. Peeping in, one sees his bed and  chair behind a curtain, screened off from his little office. And all so  tidy and pleased-looking.    From the islands one of the Mediterranean sailing ships is beating her  way, across our track, to Trapani. I don't know the name of ships but  the carpenter says she is a schooner: he says it with that Italian  misgiving which doesn't really know but which can't bear not to know.  Anyhow on she comes, with her tall ladder of square sails white in the  afternoon light, and her lovely prow, curved in with a perfect hollow,  running like a wild animal on a scent across the waters. There--the  scent leads her north again. She changes her tack from the harbour  mouth, and goes coursing away, passing behind us. Lovely she is, nimble  and quick and palpitating, with all her sails white and bright and  eager.    We are changing our course. We have all the time been heading for the  south of Levanzo. Now I see the island slowly edging back, as if  clearing out of the way for us, like a man in the street. The island  edges and turns aside: and walks away. And clearly we are making for the  harbour mouth. We have all this time been running, out at sea, round the  back of the harbour. Now I see the fortress-castle, an old thing, out  forward to sea: and a little lighthouse and the way in. And beyond, the  town-front with great palm trees and other curious dark trees, and  behind these the large square buildings of the south rising imposingly,  as if severe, big palaces upon the promenade. It all has a stately,  southern, imposing appearance, withal remote from our modern centuries:  standing back from the tides of our industrial life.    I remember the Crusaders, how they called here so often on their way to  the East. And Trapani seems waiting for them still, with its palm trees  and its silence, full in the afternoon sun. It has not much to do but  wait, apparently.    The q-b emerges into the sun, crying out how lovely! And the sea is  quieter: we are already in the lea of the harbour-curve. From the north  the many-sailed ship from the islands is running down towards us, with  the wind. And away on the south, on the sea-level, numerous short  windmills are turning their sails briskly, windmill after windmill,  rather stumpy, spinning gaily in the blue, silent afternoon, among the  salt-lagoons stretching away towards Marsala. But there is a whole  legion of windmills, and Don Quixote would have gone off his head. There  they spin, hither and thither, upon the pale-blue sea-levels. And  perhaps one catches a glitter of white salt-h"]]]
