The first sex is here  represented at the upper and under figures; the middle is of the female,  which M. Godart has not described. It is a native of Brazil; I found it at  Bahia only in certain woods, and subsequently met with a variety in the  province of Rio Janeiro, differing only in being much larger.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 93    [Illustration]    PAPILIO Pandrosus.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _P.

Godart has anticipated me in the first publication of this, and a great  many other newly discovered Brazilian insects; it has, however, not been  figured; and I take this opportunity of expressing my doubts, whether this  and the next are not sexes of the same species, rather than two,  permanently distinct. I have not, at this particular time, the means of  referring either to my notes or my collections, by which the recollection I  have on the subject might be in some way confirmed; and, until this is  done, it is much better retaining the two insects as distinct species: the  figures of both will show their very close resemblance, in every thing but  the bands on the upper surface of the wings. I found them common in the  province of Rio de Janeiro.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 94    [Illustration]    PAPILIO Torquatus.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _P.

M. Godart has, however,  recorded it in his account of this superb genus in the _Encyclopedie  Methodique_; and the minute and clear descriptions which this able  entomologist has given throughout that work, merit the highest eulogium.  Our own figures will, however, render a detailed description in this place  unnecessary.    M. Godart says, this insect is found both in Guiana and Brazil. In the  latter country, I met with it only in the province of Rio de Janeiro, where  it is common.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 95    [Illustration]    CINNYRIS chalybeia,    _Lesser collared Creeper._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum elongatum, gracillimum, arcuatum, apice acutissimo,      integerrimo, ad basin depressum, lateribus compressis, marginibus      inflexis, subtilissime dentatis; mandibula inferiore convexa.

To the personal observations of M. Vaillant we owe the first, and  indeed the only detailed account, of their real economy, and which this  enterprising ornithologist remarked during his travels in Africa, and  published in his work on the birds of that continent; a work which will be  valued and consulted when most of the systems framed by closet naturalists  will be forgotten.    M. Vaillant records a singular fact respecting these birds: which is, that  the males only assume their rich and vivid colours during the season of  courtship; at other times they are scarcely to be known from the females,  whose plumage in general is very plain. Another bird, very nearly  resembling this, has been figured by M. Vaillant under the name of _Le  Sucrier a Plastron rouge_ (Ois. d'Af. pl. 300.); his reasons, however, for  separating them, are, I think, sufficient, at least until more forcible  ones are adduced than mere conjecture. Our figure is the size of life; on  each side the breast is a tuft of yellow feathers; the back, neck, and head  shining golden green, changing in various lights. The female is said to be  the _Certhia Capensis_ of Lin., which is greyish brown above, and paler  beneath.    The different generic names which have been given to these birds by modern  systematic writers, require some elucidation. They were originally placed  by Linnaeus among the _Certhiae_; out of this genus Illiger formed another  by the name of _Nectarinia_, in which he included not only these birds, but  many others allied to them. From this genus of Illiger's, Cuvier separated  a part under the generic appellation of _Cinnyris_, a genus which comprised  those species of Illiger's _Nectarinia_ only which are found in the  parallels of latitude of the old world. So far these changes can be  understood; but Professor Temminck, without noticing this previous  arrangement, places the birds belonging to Cuvier's genus _Cinnyris_, under  his own modification of Illiger's _Nectarinia_, while to the _Nectariniae_,  as characterized by Cuvier, he gives the generic name of _Coereba_. This  last change has introduced great confusion; for the student must bear in  mind, that Cuvier's genus _Nectarinia_ corresponds to Temminck's _Coereba_;  that _Cinnyris_ of Cuvier is _Nectarinia_ of Temminck; and finally, that  all these are included under Illiger's original genus _Nectarinia_! M.  Vieillot has still further added to this unfortunate multiplicity of names,  by giving that of _Mellisuga_ to Cuvier's _Cinnyris_. This may truly be  termed a war of words. In the meantime, as Cuvier was the first who, by  giving the name of _Cinnyris_, designated the _Sucriers_ of Vaillant, and  those _only_, his definition and generic name to these birds should  unquestionably supersede all others.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 96    [Illustration]    ANODON rugosus,    _Wrinkled Horse Mussel._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Testa transversa, plerumque tenuis.

The old musket often  hung fire from five to ten seconds, and the premonitory flash could be  seen as the shaky flint clattered down on the pan. The veteran always  patiently covered the bird until the charge got out. The recoil was  tremendous, and the old man often went down before the bird; but such  positions, he asserted, were taken voluntarily, as ones of rest. Some  said that the gun had been known to kick him again after he was down.    Sachem's narration was here cut short by the dogs again pointing. This  was followed by the usual bombardment, which over, the bag showed the  magnificent aggregate of two chickens for the entire day's sport.    The prairie-chicken is now extinct in many of the Western States where  it was once well known. Usually, during the first few years of  settlement, it increases rapidly, and is often a nuisance to pioneer  farmers. Perhaps, when the latter first settle in a country, a few  covies may be seen; under the favorable influences of wheat and  corn-fields, the dozens increase to thousands and cover the land. But  with denser settlement come more guns, and, what is a far more  destructive agent, trained dogs also. Under the first order of things,  the farmer, with his musket, might kill enough for the home table. With  double-barreled gun and keen-scented pointer, the sportsman and  pot-hunter think nothing of fifty or sixty birds for a day's work. It  seems almost impossible, under such a combination, for a covey to escape  total annihilation.    We may suppose a couple of fair shots hunting over a dog in August, when  the chickens lie close, and the year's broods are in their most delicate  condition for the table. The pointer makes a stand before a fine covey  hidden in the thick grass before him. The ready guns ask no delay, and,  at the word, he flushes the chickens immediately under his nose. Each  hunter takes those which rise before him, or on his side, and if four or  less left cover at the first alarm, that number of gray-speckled forms  the next moment are down in the grass, not to leave it again. If more  rose, they are \"marked,\" which means that their place of alighting is  carefully noted, and, as the chicken has but a short flight, this task  is easy. Meanwhile, the guns have been reloaded, the dog flushes others  of the hiding birds, and so the sport goes on. The birds that get away  are \"marked down,\" and again found and flushed by the dog. Without this  useful animal the chickens would multiply, despite any number of  hunters. I have often seen covies go down in the grass but a few hundred  yards away, yet have tramped through the spot dozens of times without  raising a single bird. In twenty years this delicious game will probably  be as much a thing of the past as is the Dodo of the Isle de France. At  the period of our visit they were already gathering into their fall  flocks, which sometimes number a hundred or more. In these they remain  until St. Valentine recommends a separation. During the colder weather  of winter they seek the protection of the timber, and may be seen of  mornings on the trees and fences. They never roost there, however, but  pass the night hidden in the adjacent grass.    The prairie-chicken's admirers are numerous, other animals beside man  being willing to dine on its plump breast. We had an illustration of  this in our first day's shooting. Sometimes when we fired, the report  would attract to our vicinity wandering hawks, and we found that either  instinct or previous experience teaches these fierce hunters of the air  that in the vicinity of their fellow-hunter, man, wounded birds may be  found. One wounded chicken, which fell near us, was seized by a hawk  immediately.    As we passed one or two fields, indications of gophers appeared, their  small mounds of earth covering the ground. In some counties these  animals formerly destroyed crops to such an extent that the celebrated  \"Gopher Act\" was passed. This gave a bounty of two dollars for each  scalp, and under it many farms yielded more to the acre than ever before  or since. One of these animals which we secured resembled in size and  shape the Norway rat, and, in the softness and color of its coat, was  not unlike a mole. The oddest thing was its earth-pouches--two open  sacks, one on either side of its head, and capable of containing each a  tablespoonful or more. These the gopher employs, in his subterranean  researches, for the same purpose that his enemy, man, does a  wheelbarrow. Packing them with dirt, the little fellow trudges gayly to  the surface, and there cleverly dumps his load.    We reached town again, well pleased with our day's ride, and over our  evening pipes discussed the results. Muggs thought our shot were too  small. Sachem thought the birds were.    Colon was delighted with the new State, but believed that wing-shooting  was not his _forte_. He would be more apt to hit a bird on the wing if  he could only catch it roosting somewhere.    Gripe, at the other end of the room, was piling Republican doctrines  upon a bearded Democratic heathen from the Western border.          CHAPTER V.         A TRIAL BY JUDGE LYNCH--HUNG FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT--QUAIL       SHOOTING--HABITS OF THE BIRDS, AND MODE OF KILLING THEM--A RING OF       QUAILS--THE EFFECTS OF A SEVERE WINTER--THE SNOW GOOSE.      A short time after supper, Tenacious Gripe appeared with the mayor of  the city, who wished to make the acquaintance of the Professor. The two  august personages bowed to each other. It was the happiest moment in  their respective lives, they declared. An invitation was extended us to  delay our departure another day and try quail shooting. The citizens  said the birds were unusually abundant, the previous winter having been  mild and the summer long enough for two separate broods to be hatched,  and the brush and river banks were swarming with them. As we were about  to abandon the birds of the West and seek an acquaintance with its  beasts, we decided, after a brief consultation, to accept the invitation  and remain another day.    Among the persons present in the crowded office of the hotel, was a man  from the southwestern part of the state who had lately been interested  in a trial before the celebrated Judge Lynch. Sachem interviewed him,  and reports his statement of the occurrence in the log book, as  follows:      A stranger played me fur a fool,      An' threw the high, low, jack,    An' sold me the wuss piece of mule      That ever humped a back.      But that wer fair; I don't complain,      That I got beat in trade;    I don't sour on a fellow's gain,      When sich is honest made.      But wust wer this, he stole the mule,      An' I were bilked complete;    Such thieves, we hossmen makes a rule      To lift 'em from their feet.      We started arter that 'ere pup,      An' took the judge along,    For fear, with all our dander up,      We might do somethin' wrong.      We caught him under twenty miles,      An tried him under trees;    The judge he passed around the \"smiles,\"      As sort o' jury fees.      \"Pris'ner,\" says judge, \"now say your say,      An' make it short an' sweet,    An', while yer at it, kneel and pray,      For Death yer can not cheat.      No man shall hang, by this 'ere court,      Exceptin' on the square;    There's time fur speech, if so it's short,      But none to chew or swear.\"    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION. BUFFALO_    JUDGE LYNCH--HIS COURT.    JUDGE AND JURY. SHERIFF. ATTORNEY. LOAFER. CLERK. DEPUTY SHERIFF.]      An' then the thievin' rascal cursed,      An' threw his life away,    He said, \"Just pony out your worst,      Your best would be foul play.\"      Then judge he frowned an awful frown,      An' snapped this sentence short,    \"Jones, twitch the rope, an' write this down,      Hung for contempt of court!\"    Sharp 8 next morning saw us on the road leading east of town, the two  dogs with us, and a young one additional, the property of a resident  sportsman. Our last acquisition joined us on the run, and kept on it all  day, going over the ground with the speed of a greyhound, his fine nose,  however, giving him better success than his reckless pace would have  indicated.    Three miles from town, or half way between it and Tecumseh, our party  left the wagon, with direction for it to follow the road, while we  scouted along on a parallel, following the river bank.    The Kaw stretched eastward, broad and shallow, with numerous sand bars,  and along its edges grew the scarlet sumach and some stunted bushes, and  between these and the corn a high, coarse bottom grass, with intervals  at every hundred yards or so apart of a shorter variety, like that on a  poor prairie. Among the bushes, there was no grass whatever, and yet the  birds seemed indifferently to frequent one spot equally with another.    In less than ten minutes after leaving the wagon, all the dogs were  pointing on a barren looking spot, thinly sprinkled with scrubby bushes  not larger than jimson-weeds. They were several yards apart, so that  each animal was clearly acting on his own responsibility.    If it puzzled us the day before to discover any signs of game under  their noses, it certainly did so now. There was apparently no place of  concealment for any object larger than a field-mouse. The bushes were  wide apart, and the soil between was a loose sand. Around the roots of  the scrubs, it is true, a few thin, wiry spears of grass struggled into  existence, but these covered a space not larger than a man's hand, and  it seemed preposterous to imagine that they could be capable of  affording cover. That three dogs were pointing straight at three bushes  was apparent, but we could see nothing in or about the latter calling  for such attention.    Shamus, who had accompanied us, wished to know if the twigs were witch  hazels, because, if so, three invisible"]]]
