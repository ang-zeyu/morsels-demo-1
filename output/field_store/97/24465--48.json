[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4973"],[0,"Frederick Chopin, as a Man and Musician â€” Complete (#8)"],[1,"day--February 8.]    in a mean little house at Zelazowa Wola, a village about twenty-eight  English miles from Warsaw belonging to the Countess Skarbek.    [FOOTNOTE: Count Wodzinski, after indicating the general features of  Polish villages--the dwor (manor-house) surrounded by a \"bouquet of  trees\"; the barns and stables forming a square with a well in the  centre; the roads planted with poplars and bordered with thatched huts;  the rye, wheat, rape, and clover fields, &c.--describes the birthplace  of Frederick Chopin as follows: \"I have seen there the same dwor  embosomed in trees, the same outhouses, the same huts, the same plains  where here and there a wild pear-tree throws its shadow. Some steps from  the mansion I stopped before a little cot with a slated roof, flanked  by a little wooden perron. Nothing has been changed for nearly a hundred  years. A dark passage traverses it. On the left, in a room illuminated  by the reddish flame of slowly-consumed logs, or by the uncertain  light of two candles placed at each extremity of the long table,  the maid-servants spin as in olden times, and relate to each other a  thousand marvellous legends. On the right, in a lodging of three rooms,  so low that one can touch the ceiling, a man of some thirty years,  brown, with vivacious eyes, the face closely shaven.\" This man was  of course Nicholas Chopin. I need hardly say that Count Wodzinski's  description is novelistically tricked out. His accuracy may be judged  by the fact that a few pages after the above passage he speaks of the  discoloured tiles of the roof which he told his readers before was of  slate.]    The son of the latter, Count Frederick Skarbek, Nicholas Chopin's pupil,  a young man of seventeen, stood godfather and gave his name to the  new-born offspring of his tutor. Little Frederick's residence at the  village cannot have been of long duration.    The establishment of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw in 1807 had ushered in a  time big with chances for a capable man, and we may be sure that a  young husband and father, no doubt already on the look-out for some more  lucrative and independent employment, was determined not to miss them.  Few peaceful revolutions, if any, can compare in thoroughness with the  one that then took place in Poland; a new sovereign ascended the throne,  two differently-constituted representative bodies superseded the old  Senate and Diet, the French code of laws was introduced, the army and  civil service underwent a complete re-organisation, public instruction  obtained a long-needed attention, and so forth. To give an idea of the  extent of the improvement effected in matters of education, it is enough  to mention that the number of schools rose from 140 to 634, and that  a commission was formed for the publication of suitable books of  instruction in the Polish language. Nicholas Chopin's hopes were not  frustrated; for on October 1, 1810, he was appointed professor of the  French language at the newly-founded Lyceum in Warsaw, and a little more  than a year after, on January 1, 1812, to a similar post at the School  of Artillery and Engineering.    The exact date when Nicholas Chopin and his family settled in Warsaw is  not known, nor is it of any consequence. We may, however, safely assume  that about this time little Frederick was an inhabitant of the Polish  metropolis. During the first years of his life the parents may  have lived in somewhat straitened circumstances. The salary of the  professorship, even if regularly paid, would hardly suffice for a family  to live comfortably, and the time was unfavourable for gaining much by  private tuition. M. de Pradt, describing Poland in 1812, says:--       Nothing could exceed the misery of all classes. The army was     not paid, the officers were in rags, the best houses were in     ruins, the greatest lords were compelled to leave Warsaw from     want of money to provide for their tables. No pleasures, no     society, no invitations as in Paris and in London. I even saw     princesses quit Warsaw from the most extreme distress. The     Princess Radziwill had brought two women from England and     France, she wished to send them back, but had to keep them     because she was unable to pay their salaries and travelling     expenses. I saw in Warsaw two French physicians who informed     me that they could not procure their fees even from the     greatest lords.    But whatever straits the parents may have been put to, the weak,  helpless infant would lack none of the necessaries of life, and enjoy  all the reasonable comforts of his age.    When in 1815 peace was restored and a period of quiet followed, the  family must have lived in easy circumstances; for besides holding  appointments as professor at some public schools (under the Russian  government he became also one of the staff of teachers at the Military  Preparatory School), Nicholas Chopin kept for a number of years a  boarding-school, which was patronised by the best families of the  country. The supposed poverty of Chopin's parents has given rise to all  sorts of misconceptions and misstatements. A writer in Larousse's  \"Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siecle\" even builds on it a  theory explanatory of the character of Chopin and his music: \"Sa famille  d'origine francaise,\" he writes, \"jouissait d'une mediocre fortune; de  la, peut-etre, certains froissements dans l'organisation nerveuse et  la vive sensibilite de l'enfant, sentiments qui devaient plus tard  se refleter dans ses oeuvres, empreintes generalement d'une profonde  melancolie.\" If the writer of the article in question had gone a little  farther back, he might have found a sounder basis for his theory in the  extremely delicate physical organisation of the man, whose sensitiveness  was so acute that in early infancy he could not hear music without  crying, and resisted almost all attempts at appeasing him.    The last-mentioned fact, curious and really noteworthy in itself,  acquires a certain preciousness by its being the only one transmitted  to us of that period of Chopin's existence. But this scantiness of  information need not cause us much regret. During the first years of a  man's life biography is chiefly concerned with his surroundings, with  the agencies that train his faculties and mould his character. A  man's acts and opinions are interesting in proportion to the degree of  consolidation attained by his individuality. Fortunately our material is  abundant enough to enable us to reconstruct in some measure the milieu  into which Chopin was born and in which he grew up. We will begin with  that first circle which surrounds the child--his family. The negative  advantages which our Frederick found there--the absence of the  privations and hardships of poverty, with their depressing and often  demoralising influence--have already been adverted to; now I must say a  few words about the positive advantages with which he was favoured.  And it may be at once stated that they cannot be estimated too highly.  Frederick enjoyed the greatest of blessings that can be bestowed upon  mortal man--viz., that of being born into a virtuous and well-educated  family united by the ties of love. I call it the greatest of blessings,  because neither catechism and sermons nor schools and colleges can take  the place,, or compensate for the want, of this education that does not  stop at the outside, but by its subtle, continuous action penetrates to  the very heart's core and pervades the whole being. The atmosphere in  which Frederick lived was not only moral and social, but also distinctly  intellectual.    The father, Nicholas Chopin, seems to have been a man of worth and  culture, honest of purpose, charitable in judgment, attentive to duty,  and endowed with a good share of prudence and commonsense. In support of  this characterisation may be advanced that among his friends he counted  many men of distinction in literature, science, and art; that between  him and the parents of his pupils as well as the pupils themselves there  existed a friendly relation; that he was on intimate terms with several  of his colleagues; and that his children not only loved, but also  respected him. No one who reads his son's letters, which indeed give us  some striking glimpses of the man, can fail to notice this last point.  On one occasion, when confessing that he had gone to a certain dinner  two hours later than he had been asked, Frederick foresees his father's  anger at the disregard for what is owing to others, and especially  to one's elders; and on another occasion he makes excuses for his  indifference to non-musical matters, which, he thinks, his father will  blame. And mark, these letters were written after Chopin had attained  manhood. What testifies to Nicholas Chopin's, abilities as a teacher and  steadiness as a man, is the unshaken confidence of the government: he  continued in his position at the Lyceumtill after the revolution in  1831, when this institution, like many others, was closed; he was then  appointed a member of the board for the examination of candidates for  situations as schoolmasters, and somewhat later he became professor of  the French language at the Academy of the Roman Catholic Clergy.    It is more difficult, or rather it is impossible, to form anything like  a clear picture of his wife, Justina Chopin. None of those of her son's  letters that are preserved is addressed to her, and in those addressed  to the members of the family conjointly, or to friends, nothing occurs  that brings her nearer to us, or gives a clue to her character. George  Sand said that she was Chopin's only passion. Karasowski describes  her as \"particularly tender-hearted and rich in all the truly womanly  virtues.....For her quietness and homeliness were the greatest  happiness.\" K. W. Wojcicki, in \"Cmentarz Powazkowski\" (Powazki  Cemetery), expresses, himself in the same strain. A Scotch lady, who had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4974"],[0,"Australia Twice Traversed (#8)"],[1,"is divided into five separate colonies, whose respective  capitals are situated several hundreds of miles apart. The oldest  colony is New South Wales. The largest in area is Western Australia,  next comes South Australia; then Queensland, New South Wales, and  lastly Victoria, which, though the smallest in area, is now the first  in importance among the group. It was no wonder that Mitchell, the  Surveyor-General of New South Wales, designated that region \"Australia  Felix.\"    It may be strange, but it is no less true, that there is almost as  great a difference between the fiscal laws and governments of the  various Australian Colonies as between those of foreign States in  Europe--the only thing in common being the language and the money of  the British Empire. Although however, they agree to differ amongst  themselves, there can be no doubt of the loyalty of the group, as a  whole, to their parent nation. I shall go no further into this matter,  as, although English enough, it is foreign to my subject. I shall  treat more especially of the colony or colonies within whose  boundaries my travels led me, and shall begin with South Australia,  where my first expedition was conducted.    South Australia includes a vast extent of country called the Northern  Territory, which must become in time a separate colony, as it extends  from the 26th parallel of latitude, embracing the whole country  northwards to the Indian Ocean at the 11th parallel. South Australia  possesses one advantage over the other colonies, from the geographical  fact of her oblong territory extending, so to speak, exactly in the  middle right across the continent from the Southern to the Indian  Ocean. The dimensions of the colony are in extreme length over 1800  miles, by a breadth of nearly 700, and almost through the centre of  this vast region the South Australian Transcontinental Telegraph line  runs from Adelaide, via Port Augusta, to Port Darwin.    At the time I undertook my first expedition in 1872, this extensive  work had just been completed, and it may be said to divide the  continent into halves, which, for the purpose I then had in view,  might be termed the explored and the unexplored halves. For several  years previous to my taking the field, I had desired to be the first  to penetrate into this unknown region, where, for a thousand miles in  a straight line, no white man's foot had ever wandered, or, if it had,  its owner had never brought it back, nor told the tale. I had ever  been a delighted student of the narratives of voyages and discoveries,  from Robinson Crusoe to Anson and Cook, and the exploits on land in  the brilliant accounts given by Sturt, Mitchell, Eyre, Grey,  Leichhardt, and Kennedy, constantly excited my imagination, as my own  travels may do that of future rovers, and continually spurred me on to  emulate them in the pursuit they had so eminently graced.    My object, as indeed had been Leichhardt's, was to force my way across  the thousand miles that lay untrodden and unknown, between the South  Australian telegraph line and the settlements upon the Swan River.  What hopes I formed, what aspirations came of what might be my  fortune, for I trust it will be believed that an explorer may be an  imaginative as well as a practical creature, to discover in that  unknown space. Here let me remark that the exploration of 1000 miles  in Australia is equal to 10,000 in any other part of the earth's  surface, always excepting Arctic and Antarctic travels.    There was room for snowy mountains, an inland sea, ancient river, and  palmy plain, for races of new kinds of men inhabiting a new and  odorous land, for fields of gold and golcondas of gems, for a new  flora and a new fauna, and, above all the rest combined, there was  room for me! Many well-meaning friends tried to dissuade me  altogether, and endeavoured to instil into my mind that what I so  ardently wished to attempt was simply deliberate suicide, and to  persuade me of the truth of the poetic line, that the sad eye of  experience sees beneath youth's radiant glow, so that, like Falstaff,  I was only partly consoled by the remark that they hate us youth. But  in spite of their experience, and probably on account of youth's  radiant glow, I was not to be deterred, however, and at last I met  with Baron von Mueller, who, himself an explorer with the two  Gregorys, has always had the cause of Australian exploration at heart,  and he assisting, I was at length enabled to take the field. Baron  Mueller and I had consulted, and it was deemed advisable that I should  make a peculiar feature near the Finke river, called Chambers' Pillar,  my point of departure for the west. This Pillar is situated in  latitude 24 degrees 55' and longitude 133 degrees 50', being 1200  miles from Melbourne in a straight line, over which distance Mr.  Carmichael, a black boy, and I travelled. In the course of our travels  from Melbourne to the starting point, we reached Port Augusta, a  seaport though an inland town, at the head of Spencer's Gulf in South  Australia, first visited by the Investigator in 1803, and where, a few  miles to the eastwards, a fine bold range of mountains runs along for  scores of miles and bears the gallant navigator's name. A railway line  of 250 miles now connects Port Augusta with Adelaide. To this town was  the first section of the Transcontinental telegraph line carried; and  it was in those days the last place where I could get stores for my  expedition. Various telegraph stations are erected along the line, the  average distance between each being from 150 to 200 miles. There were  eleven stations between Port Augusta and Port Darwin. A railway is now  completed as far as the Peake Telegraph Station, about 450 miles  north-westwards from Port Augusta along the telegraph line towards  Port Darwin, to which it will no doubt be carried before many years  elapse.    From Port Augusta the Flinders range runs almost northerly for nearly  200 miles, throwing out numerous creeks (I must here remark that  throughout this work the word creek will often occur. This is not to  be considered in its English acceptation of an inlet from the sea,  but, no matter how far inland, it means, in Australia a watercourse.),  through rocky pine-clad glens and gorges, these all emptying, in times  of flood, into the salt lake Torrens, that peculiar depression which  baffled Eyre in 1840-1. Captain Frome, the Surveyor-General of the  Colony, dispelled the old horse-shoe-shaped illusion of this feature,  and discovered that there were several similar features instead of  one. As far as the Flinders range extends northwards, the water supply  of the traveller in that region is obtained from its watercourses. The  country beyond, where this long range falls off, continues an  extensive open stony plateau or plain, occasionally intersected with  watercourses, the course of the line of road being west of north. Most  of these watercourses on the plains fall into Lake Eyre, another and  more northerly salt depression. A curious limestone formation now  occurs, and for some hundreds of miles the whole country is open and  studded with what are called mound-springs. These are usually about  fifty feet high, and ornamented on the summit with clumps of tall  reeds or bulrushes. These mounds are natural artesian wells, through  which the water, forced up from below, gushes out over the tops to the  level ground, where it forms little water-channels at which sheep and  cattle can water. Some of these mounds have miniature lakes on their  summits, where people might bathe. The most perfect mound is called  the Blanche Cup, in latitude about 29 degrees 20', and longitude 136  degrees 40'.    The water of some of these springs is fresh and good, the Blanche Cup  is drinkable, but the generality of them have either a mineral salt-  or soda-ish taste; at first their effect is aperient, but afterwards  just the opposite. The water is good enough for animals.    The Honourable Sir Thomas Elder's sheep, cattle, horse, and camel  station, Beltana, is the first telegraph station from Port Augusta,  the distance being 150 miles. The next is at the Strangways Springs,  about 200 miles distant. This station occupies a nearly central  position in this region of mound-springs; it is situated on a low rise  out of the surrounding plain; all around are dozens of these peculiar  mounds. The Messrs. Hogarth and Warren, who own the sheep and cattle  station, have springs with a sufficiently strong flow of water to  spout their wool at shearing time. The next telegraph station beyond  the Strangways is the Peake, distant 100 miles. About twenty miles  northward, or rather north-westward, from the Peake the mound-springs  cease, and the country is watered by large pools in stony watercourses  and creek beds. These pools are generally no more than twelve to  fifteen miles apart. The waters in times of flood run into Lake Eyre,  which receives the Cooper and all the flood waters of West and  South-western Queensland, and all the drainage from the hundred  watercourses of Central South Australia. The chief among the latter is  the huge artery, the Finke, from the north-west.    The Charlotte Waters Station, named after Lady Charlotte Bacon, the  Ianthe of Byron, which was to be my last outpost of civilisation, is a  quadrangular stone building, plastered or painted white, having a  corrugated iron roof, and a courtyard enclosed by the two wings of the  building, having loop-holes in the walls for rifles and musketry, a  cemented water-tank dug under the yard, and tall heavy iron gates to  secure the place from attack by the natives.    I may here relate an occurrence at a station farther up the line,  built upon the same principle. One evening, while the telegraph master  and staff were sitting outside the gates after the heat of the day,  the natives, knowing that the stand of arms was inside the"]]]
