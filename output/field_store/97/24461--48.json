This was  instantly succeeded by a fierce, wild, and prolonged cry, expressive at  once of triumph and revenge. It was that peculiar cry which an Indian  utters when the reeking scalp has been wrested from his murdered victim.    \"Missed him, as I am a sinner,\" exclaimed Sir Everard, springing to his  feet, and knocking the butt of his rifle on the ground with a movement  of impatience. \"Sambo, you young scoundrel, it was all your fault,--you  moved your shoulder as I pulled the trigger. Thank Heaven, however, the  aim of the Indian appears to have been no better, although the sharp  whistling of his ball proves his piece to have been well levelled for a  random shot.\"    \"His aim has been too true,\" faintly pronounced the voice of one  somewhat in the rear of his companions. \"The ball of the villain has  found a lodgment in my breast. God bless ye all, my boys; may your  fates be more lucky than mine!\" While he yet spoke, Lieutenant Murphy  sank into the arms of Blessington and De Haldimar, who had flown to him  at the first intimation of his wound, and was in the next instant a  corpse.          CHAPTER III.    \"To your companies, gentlemen, to your companies on the instant. There  is treason in the fort, and we had need of all our diligence and  caution. Captain de Haldimar is missing, and the gate has been found  unlocked. Quick, gentlemen, quick; even now the savages may be around  us, though unseen.\"    \"Captain de Haldimar missing!--the gate unlocked!\" exclaimed a number  of voices. \"Impossible!--surely we are not betrayed by our own men.\"    \"The sentinel has been relieved, and is now in irons,\" resumed the  communicator of this startling piece of intelligence. It was the  adjutant of the regiment.    \"Away, gentlemen, to your posts immediately,\" said Captain Blessington,  who, aided by De Haldimar, hastened to deposit the stiffening body of  the unfortunate Murphy, which they still supported, upon the rampart.  Then addressing the adjutant, \"Mr. Lawson, let a couple of files be  sent immediately to remove the body of their officer.\"    \"That shot which I heard from the common, as I approached, was not  fired at random, then, I find,\" observed the adjutant, as they all now  hastily descended to join their men.--\"Who has fallen?\"    \"Murphy, of the grenadiers,\" was the reply of one near him.    \"Poor fellow! our work commences badly,\" resumed Mr. Lawson: \"Murphy  killed, and Captain de Haldimar missing. We had few officers enough to  spare before, and their loss will be severely felt; I greatly fear,  too, these casualties may have a tendency to discourage the men.\"    \"Nothing more easy than to supply their place, by promoting some of our  oldest sergeants,\" observed Ensign Delme, who, as well as the ill-fated  Murphy, had risen from the ranks. \"If they behave themselves well, the  King will confirm their appointments.\"    \"But my poor brother, what of him, Lawson? what have you learnt  connected with his disappearance?\" asked Charles de Haldimar with deep  emotion.    \"Nothing satisfactory, I am sorry to say,\" returned the adjutant; \"in  fact, the whole affair is a mystery which no one can unravel; even at  this moment the sentinel, Frank Halloway, who is strongly suspected of  being privy to his disappearance, is undergoing a private examination  by your father the governor.\"    \"Frank Halloway!\" repeated the youth with a start of astonishment;  \"surely Halloway could never prove a traitor,--and especially to my  brother, whose life he once saved at the peril of his own.\"    The officers had now gained the parade, when the \"Fall in, gentlemen,  fall in,\" quickly pronounced by Major Blackwater, prevented all further  questioning on the part of the younger De Haldimar.    The scene, though circumscribed in limit, was picturesque in effect,  and might have been happily illustrated by the pencil of the painter.  The immediate area of the parade was filled with armed men, distributed  into three divisions, and forming, with their respective ranks facing  outwards, as many sides of a hollow square, the mode of defence  invariably adopted by the Governor in all cases of sudden alarm. The  vacant space, which communicated with the powder magazine, was left  open to the movements of three three-pounders, which were to support  each face in the event of its being broken by numbers. Close to these,  and within the square, stood the number of gunners necessary to the  duty of the field-pieces, each of which was commanded by a bombardier.  At the foot of the ramparts, outside the square, and immediately  opposite to their several embrasures, were stationed the gunners  required for the batteries, under a non-commissioned officer also, and  the whole under the direction of a superior officer of that arm, who  now walked to and fro, conversing in a low voice with Major Blackwater.  One gunner at each of these divisions of the artillery held in his hand  a blazing torch, reflecting with picturesque yet gloomy effect the  bright bayonets and equipment of the soldiers, and the anxious  countenances of the women and invalids, who, bending eagerly through  the windows of the surrounding barracks, appeared to await the issue of  these preparations with an anxiety increased by the very consciousness  of having no other parts than those of spectators to play in the scene  that was momentarily expected.    In a few minutes from the falling in of the officers with their  respective companies, the clank of irons was heard in the direction of  the guard-room, and several forms were seen slowly advancing into the  area already occupied as we have described. This party was preceded by  the Adjutant Lawson, who, advancing towards Major Blackwater,  communicated a message, that was followed by the command of the latter  officer for the three divisions to face inwards. The officer of  artillery also gave the word to his men to form lines of single files  immediately in the rear of their respective guns, leaving space enough  for the entrance of the approaching party, which consisted of half a  dozen files of the guard, under a non-commissioned officer, and one  whose manacled limbs, rather than his unaccoutred uniform, attested him  to be not merely a prisoner, but a prisoner confined for some serious  and flagrant offence.    This party now advanced through the vacant quarter of the square, and  took their stations immediately in the centre. Here the countenances of  each, and particularly that of the prisoner, who was, if we may so term  it, the centre of that centre, were thrown into strong relief by the  bright glare of the torches as they were occasionally waved in air, to  disencumber them of their dross, so that the features of the prisoner  stood revealed to those around as plainly as if it had been noonday.  Not a sound, not a murmur, escaped from the ranks: but, though the  etiquette and strict laws of military discipline chained all speech,  the workings of the inward mind remained unchecked; and as they  recognised in the prisoner Frank Halloway, one of the bravest and  boldest in the field, and, as all had hitherto imagined, one of the  most devoted to his duty, an irrepressible thrill of amazement and  dismay crept throughout the frames, and for a moment blanched the  cheeks of those especially who belonged to the same company. On being  summoned from their fruitless search after the stranger, to fall in  without delay, it had been whispered among the men that treason had  crept into the fort, and a traitor, partly detected in his crime, had  been arrested and thrown into irons; but the idea of Frank Halloway  being that traitor was the last that could have entered into their  thoughts, and yet they now beheld him covered with every mark of  ignominy, and about to answer his high offence, in all human  probability, with his life.    With the officers the reputation of Halloway for courage and fidelity  stood no less high; but, while they secretly lamented the circumstance  of his defalcation, they could not disguise from themselves the almost  certainty of his guilt, for each, as he now gazed upon the prisoner,  recollected the confusion and hesitation of manner he had evinced when  questioned by them preparatory to their ascending to the ramparts.    Once more the suspense of the moment was interrupted by the entrance of  other forms into the area. They were those of the Adjutant, followed by  a drummer, bearing his instrument, and the Governor's orderly, charged  with pens, ink, paper, and a book which, from its peculiar form and  colour, every one present knew to be a copy of the Articles of War. A  variety of contending emotions passed through the breasts of many, as  they witnessed the silent progress of these preparations, rendered  painfully interesting by the peculiarity of their position, and the  wildness of the hour at which they thus found themselves assembled  together. The prisoner himself was unmoved: he stood proud, calm, and  fearless amid the guard, of whom he had so recently formed one; and  though his countenance was pale, as much, perhaps, from a sense of the  ignominious character in which he appeared as from more private  considerations, still there was nothing to denote either the abjectness  of fear or the consciousness of merited disgrace. Once or twice a low  sobbing, that proceeded at intervals from one of the barrack windows,  caught his ear, and he turned his glance in that direction with a  restless anxiety, which he exerted himself in the instant afterwards to  repress; but this was the only mark of emotion he betrayed.    The above dispositions having been hastily made, the adjutant and his  assistants once more retired. After the lapse of a minute, a tall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#8)"],[1,"a title. Then, lifting her  voice high, she cried: \"Roll out the Barrel! Everybody sing! Let's make  it ring!\"    Everybody did sing,--more people than Cherry will ever know, for through  the microphone that had been placed before her, Cherry was at last  singing on the radio. From end to end of England the song boomed on:  \"Roll out the Barrel.\"    Every platform in the subway had its radio. Station by station they  joined in until the whole tube, miles on end, echoed with the song.      \"Roll out the barrel! We'll have a barrel of fun    Roll out the barrel! We'll put the blues on the run.\"    It seemed to Dave as he listened after that song was over, that even the  Führer must have heard the applause that followed, heard and shuddered.    Dropping into a mellow mood for the oldsters who recalled that other  terrible war, Cherry sang:      \"There's a long, long trail a-winding    Into the land of my dreams,    Where the nightingale is singing    And the white moon beams.\"    Then, scarcely pausing for breath, leaning far forward, a bewitching  smile on her face, she sang: \"No! No! No! Papasista.\"    When the roar of applause had died away, Dave heard a gray-haired lady  in a Persian lamb coat say:    \"Such a vulgar song!\"    \"Quite,\" agreed her mink-coated friend. \"Vulgar and wonderful. I quite  love this war. It has given me one more chance for a fling at life.\"    \"All out for England!\" Cherry called into the megaphone. \"Everybody  sing, 'We'll roll the old chariot along'.\"    They sang. They roared. They sang.      \"If Hitler's in the way, we'll roll it over him.    If Tubby's in the way, we'll roll it over him.    If Il Duce's in the way, we'll roll it over him.    If the devil's in the way, we'll roll it over him.    We'll roll the old chariot along    And we won't tag on behind.\"    In the hush that followed, Cherry announced in a low, husky voice: \"God  save the King.\"    There followed a shuffling of feet. Every man, woman and child was on  his feet. Even the enemy planes above seemed to hush as the glorious  National Anthem rolled over England from Dover to Newcastle.    There were tears in the social service worker's eyes as she took  Cherry's hand. \"You'll come again, won't you?\" she said in a low voice  full of meaning. \"Often and often.\"    \"If--if you need me,\" was the quiet reply.    \"And you said you couldn't do it!\" Dave laughed happily as he guided her  up the stairs and back to their sub-basement for one more cup of good  American coffee.                                        _Chapter_ IX                                The Hideout      That night members of that motley subway throng shared their beds with  their new-found friends. Dave found a place with a young disabled  veteran of the battle of Flanders. They slept on a thin pad and were  covered by blankets none too thick. The subway was cold and drafty. For  two hours Dave lay there thinking. Those were long, long thoughts. Back  to the pictured walls of his mind came the peaceful pastures of Ramsey  Farm, the racing planes overhead, the falling bombs, and the drifting  parachutes. He rode once more with young Lord Applegate in that  two-seater. His blood raced again as they played hide-and-seek with an  enemy plane in the clouds. Again he heard the thundering crash of a bomb  that had exploded, not, he supposed, more than two blocks from where he  and Cherry had stood. What if it had been only one block, or no block at  all? He tried to think this last question through, and could not quite  make it. Nor could he answer to his complete satisfaction, his second  and third questions,--why had he come to England? And why did he not go  home? There would be a plane for Lisbon the day after tomorrow. Would he  take it? He doubted it. And yet it seemed to him a voice whispered, \"It  is to this or no other. Think it over.\" He did not think. Instead, he  fell asleep.    Cherry had been given a welcome by a bright young lady who sold shoes in  a great store. This young lady was wondering whether a bomb had  scattered her shoes over a city block, and her job with them. In the  midst of her chatter Cherry fell sound asleep.    Before they could leave the subway next morning two people were after  them.    The manager of the radio station, who the night before had given Cherry  such a lukewarm reception, came bustling down the stairs. She, he said,  had been \"Splendid! Splendid! Quite remarkable indeed! How the people  had taken to her! There had been wires, phone calls,--everything. Would  she come back at nine that night and sing at the studio? She should have  a competent accompanist and every courtesy. Would she come?\"    \"No.\" Cherry favored him with her brightest smile. \"I won't sing in your  studio. I can't sing in a stuffy little box with no one about except a  man in a glass case who waves his arms, pretends to cut his own throat  with his fingers, points to the tip of his nose, and goes through all  manner of other contortions just to tell me what to do.\"    All this left the man staring at her, speechless.    \"But if,\"--Cherry burst into a merry laugh--\"if you'll let me sing on my  box with my glorious red-headed Irish girl to tickle the ivories, I'll  come back, not tonight, but very soon, and often.\"    \"Oh! My dear child!\" the manager exploded. \"You are generosity itself.  But the subway is cold and drafty.\"    \"No place,\" said Cherry, and she did not smile, \"can be cold where so  many warm hearts are beating as one.\"    The man stared at her in speechless silence for a moment. Then he  murmured, \"May God forgive me if this child is not a genius.\"    But here was her mother. She too had heard the broadcast and thought it  marvelous. This was her day off. Her small car was just around the  corner. She would take them back to Ramsey Farm in time for scrambled  eggs, coffee and scones. And she did.    Mrs. Ramsey, David realized at once, was a strong, efficient person,  with a will of her own. She directed the affairs of her household as the  O. C. directs his squadron. Breakfast over, she called in the entire  group to discuss farm affairs. She commended Jock for his fine job of  plowing, and the boys for their work in the turnips and Brussels sprout  patches.    \"England is going to need food,\" she declared. \"We must all do our best.  The nights are growing cold. We may get a freeze at any time, so--oo--\"    \"So it's the potatoes next.\" Brand gave vent to a good-natured groan. He  hated picking up potatoes. Stooping over made his back ache. But theirs  was a fine crop, and it must be gathered in.    Jock got out the potato plow. Soon they were all hard at work. David  joined in. So too did Alice. Even the \"enfants terrible\", Tillie and  Peggy, helped a little. They were, however, at their best throwing  clods, so in the end they were banished.    The place where the potatoes were stored held for Dave a real  fascination.    \"We call it the Hideout,\" Alice explained, dropping down on a sack of  potatoes for a short rest. \"It's as old as the hills. Did you note the  moss on the roof?\"    \"Six inches thick,\" Dave agreed. \"And look at the walls! Solid masonry!\"    \"We believe it goes back to Feudal days.\" Alice's eyes took in the one  large room, its broad stone fireplace, two narrow windows, and massive  beams. \"In those days it was a real hideout, I shouldn't wonder,\" she  murmured.    \"And might be again,\" Dave suggested.    \"Yes, if the Huns really come,\" she agreed. \"But they'll never get this  far--England will beat them back even if they swarm in on the shore like  the waves of the sea.\"    All that day Cherry sat curled up in a great chair before the fire in  the farmhouse kitchen. She sometimes slept, sometimes thought soberly,  and sometimes dreamed. To this her wise mother offered no objections.  Cherry, she realized for the first time, had a great gift. She might, it  seemed, be of extraordinary service to all England. She could bring them  the spirit of youth, buoy them up, give them courage for the great  ordeal that lay ahead.    The potatoes were stored in a narrow, dark underground tunnel that one  entered through a door at the back of the Hideout.    \"A grand air raid shelter,\" suggested Dave.    \"Hope we never need it,\" Alice replied soberly, \"but you never can  tell.\" Her brow wrinkled. She was thinking of the hole in the ground  where an ancient playhouse had once stood. \"How about a tramp to the  village?\" she suggested.    \"O. K. by me,\" said Dave. \"I'll see if my boots are finished.\"    The boots were not finished. But then, boots at the cobbler's never  are--at least, not the first time you call.    \"You'll have to pardon the delay,\" the old man apologized. \"So many boys  from the airdrome have brought in their boots.    \"But things will go faster now.\" His face brightened. \"You see I have a  helper.\"    For the first time Dave noticed a short, sturdy young man sitting in the  corner. He was sewing on a sole and never once looked up.    Dave thought with a start, \"He has a vaguely familiar look. But I've  never seen him before, that's certain.\"    \"He does very fine work.\" The old man rubbed his hands together. \"Very  fine indeed.\"    Appearing a little disturbed by Dave's lingering look at the stranger,  old John followed him out of the shop to close the door behind him.  \"He's quite proper,\" he said, jerking a thumb backward toward the shop.  \"He looks like a German, but he's a refugee, a Hollander. You  understand?\"    \"Yes,--I\"    \"His papers are in perfect order. I saw to that you may well believe.\"  The old man laughed a trifle uncertainly. \"Our local magistrate looked  over those papers for me,\" he went on. \"We can't take chances. But this,  you see, is a rare opportunity. I've never made any real money, not in  all my long life. And now, with all these fliers coming in--\"    \"Gives you a break,\" said Dave. \"I wish you lots of luck.\" As it turned  out, the old man was to need it,--lots and lots of"]]]
