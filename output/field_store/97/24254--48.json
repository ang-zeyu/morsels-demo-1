The crown is now finished; it is to be drawn up with a needle and wool.    The opening at the back must be sewn up; and a band, corresponding with  the plain knitting in front, is to be formed by raising fifty-six  stitches in pink, and knitting three plain rows, with the No. 18  needles. Then, with white, cast sixteen stitches on the same needle, and  knit seventy-two stitches; cast on sixteen stitches, and knit three rows  of eighty-eight stitches. In the next row,--bring the wool forward, knit  two together. Knit six plain rows.    With the large needles, form the ruff, by knitting two rows in white,  and two in pink; then, work twenty-two rows--knitting four rows in  white, and two in pink, alternately. Cast off, and sew it, so as to form  a very loose double ruff round the throat.    For the front of the hood, raise eighty-two stitches, and, with the No.  18 needles, knit one plain row. Then, with the large needles,--knit two  plain rows in white; two in pink; and four in white. Cast off.--This,  when sewn double, finishes the borders of the hood. It is to be drawn,  with ribbon, at the back and front.          A Baby's Sock.      Cast on twenty-eight stitches in _pink_ German wool.--No. 19 needles.    Knit six turns, increasing a stitch at each row, to form the toe and  heel.    Knit six more turns, increasing a stitch at one end only, for the toe.    Cast off thirty stitches on another needle;--knit the remaining sixteen  stitches, for eighteen turns, and cast them off on another needle.    With _white_,--pick up the thirty pink stitches;--knit three plain  rows;--in the next row, bring the wool forward, knit two together.    Knit three plain rows; leave sixteen stitches on the needle, and repeat  the pattern in white, across the instep, seven times, which is  afterwards to be sewn to the pink knitting for the toe.    Cast on sixteen stitches in white,--to correspond with the other side.    Knit two plain rows;--in the next, bring the wool forward, knit two  together,--the whole length of the row;--knit one plain row in pink,  taking up the stitches that were cast off for the toe. This side of the  shoe is to be made to correspond with the other, by decreasing instead  of increasing.--The shoe and the white in the instep will now be  finished.    Pick up the stitches both of the shoe and instep;--knit three plain  turns. Take a larger needle,--bring the wool forward, knit two together,  forming the holes to pass the ribbon through.    Knit three plain turns with the small needle. In the next row, bring the  wool forward, knit two together.    Knit three plain rows. In the next,--bring the wool forward, knit two  together; repeat the same, until the sock be of the height  desired.--Cast off very loosely.          Another Baby's Sock.      Four-thread fleecy, or four-thread _Lady Betty's_ wool.--No. 11 needles.    Cast on twenty-six stitches.    _First row_--pearl two; knit two; alternately, to the end of the row.    _Second row_--knit two; pearl two.    _Third row_--Pearl two; knit two.    _Fourth row_--Pearl knitting.    Repeat the above four rows, twelve times,--making altogether fifty-two  rows--but, in the fifty-second row, pearl fourteen stitches only, and  cast off the remaining twelve stitches. Then,--    Raise fourteen stitches, pearling them at the same time, at the  commenced end, leaving twelve, to correspond with those cast off at the  other end. Repeat the four rows, as before, three times,--making in all  twelve rows. Fasten off, by drawing up these stitches with a needle and  wool, to form the toe, and sew up the shoe at the sole.    Twenty-seven stitches are now to be raised at the top of the shoe, round  the leg; then,--alternately pearl one row, and knit one row, for five  rows, and cast off.--This forms a finish to the top. The shoe is to be  laced across with ribbon.          A Baby's Stocking.      Cast on twenty-three stitches in brown,--No. 18 needles, and knit six  turns,--increasing one stitch at each end, for the toe and heel.    Knit six turns, increasing one stitch only, at the toe. There will now  be forty-one stitches on the needle. Cast off twenty-five stitches, and  knit the remaining sixteen stitches, for eighteen turns. One side of the  shoe and instep will now be made.    Cast on twenty-five stitches, and work the other side of the shoe to  correspond.    Pick up the stitches, with white, across the instep. Knit two turns,  catching in one loop of the sides of the shoe, in each row, to join them  together.    Knit one turn in brown; two in white; one in brown; two in white; and  one in brown.--The shoe and instep will now be finished.    Pick up the stitches of the shoe, on each side of the piece which forms  the instep. There should now be forty stitches on the needle.    Knit seven turns in white; then, eighteen turns, increasing a stitch at  the beginning and end of every other turn. Knit three plain turns; then  eighteen turns,--decreasing one stitch in every other turn, at the  beginning and end.    Forty stitches will now be found on the needle.

And turning the Prism slowly  about its Axis, until all the Light which went through one of its  Angles, and was refracted by it began to be reflected by its Base, at  which till then it went out of the Glass, I observed that those Rays  which had suffered the greatest Refraction were sooner reflected than  the rest. I conceived therefore, that those Rays of the reflected Light,  which were most refrangible, did first of all by a total Reflexion  become more copious in that Light than the rest, and that afterwards the  rest also, by a total Reflexion, became as copious as these. To try  this, I made the reflected Light pass through another Prism, and being  refracted by it to fall afterwards upon a Sheet of white Paper placed  at some distance behind it, and there by that Refraction to paint the  usual Colours of the Prism. And then causing the first Prism to be  turned about its Axis as above, I observed that when those Rays, which  in this Prism had suffered the greatest Refraction, and appeared of a  blue and violet Colour began to be totally reflected, the blue and  violet Light on the Paper, which was most refracted in the second Prism,  received a sensible Increase above that of the red and yellow, which was  least refracted; and afterwards, when the rest of the Light which was  green, yellow, and red, began to be totally reflected in the first  Prism, the Light of those Colours on the Paper received as great an  Increase as the violet and blue had done before. Whence 'tis manifest,  that the Beam of Light reflected by the Base of the Prism, being  augmented first by the more refrangible Rays, and afterwards by the less  refrangible ones, is compounded of Rays differently refrangible. And  that all such reflected Light is of the same Nature with the Sun's Light  before its Incidence on the Base of the Prism, no Man ever doubted; it  being generally allowed, that Light by such Reflexions suffers no  Alteration in its Modifications and Properties. I do not here take  Notice of any Refractions made in the sides of the first Prism, because  the Light enters it perpendicularly at the first side, and goes out  perpendicularly at the second side, and therefore suffers none. So then,  the Sun's incident Light being of the same Temper and Constitution with  his emergent Light, and the last being compounded of Rays differently  refrangible, the first must be in like manner compounded.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.]    _Illustration._ In the twenty-first Figure, ABC is the first Prism, BC  its Base, B and C its equal Angles at the Base, each of 45 Degrees, A  its rectangular Vertex, FM a beam of the Sun's Light let into a dark  Room through a hole F one third part of an Inch broad, M its Incidence  on the Base of the Prism, MG a less refracted Ray, MH a more refracted  Ray, MN the beam of Light reflected from the Base, VXY the second Prism  by which this beam in passing through it is refracted, N_t_ the less  refracted Light of this beam, and N_p_ the more refracted part thereof.  When the first Prism ABC is turned about its Axis according to the order  of the Letters ABC, the Rays MH emerge more and more obliquely out of  that Prism, and at length after their most oblique Emergence are  reflected towards N, and going on to _p_ do increase the Number of the  Rays N_p_. Afterwards by continuing the Motion of the first Prism, the  Rays MG are also reflected to N and increase the number of the Rays  N_t_. And therefore the Light MN admits into its Composition, first the  more refrangible Rays, and then the less refrangible Rays, and yet after  this Composition is of the same Nature with the Sun's immediate Light  FM, the Reflexion of the specular Base BC causing no Alteration therein.    _Exper._ 10. Two Prisms, which were alike in Shape, I tied so together,  that their Axis and opposite Sides being parallel, they composed a  Parallelopiped. And, the Sun shining into my dark Chamber through a  little hole in the Window-shut, I placed that Parallelopiped in his beam  at some distance from the hole, in such a Posture, that the Axes of the  Prisms might be perpendicular to the incident Rays, and that those Rays  being incident upon the first Side of one Prism, might go on through the  two contiguous Sides of both Prisms, and emerge out of the last Side of  the second Prism. This Side being parallel to the first Side of the  first Prism, caused the emerging Light to be parallel to the incident.  Then, beyond these two Prisms I placed a third, which might refract that  emergent Light, and by that Refraction cast the usual Colours of the  Prism upon the opposite Wall, or upon a sheet of white Paper held at a  convenient Distance behind the Prism for that refracted Light to fall  upon it. After this I turned the Parallelopiped about its Axis, and  found that when the contiguous Sides of the two Prisms became so oblique  to the incident Rays, that those Rays began all of them to be  reflected, those Rays which in the third Prism had suffered the greatest  Refraction, and painted the Paper with violet and blue, were first of  all by a total Reflexion taken out of the transmitted Light, the rest  remaining and on the Paper painting their Colours of green, yellow,  orange and red, as before; and afterwards by continuing the Motion of  the two Prisms, the rest of the Rays also by a total Reflexion vanished  in order, according to their degrees of Refrangibility. The Light  therefore which emerged out of the two Prisms is compounded of Rays  differently refrangible, seeing the more refrangible Rays may be taken  out of it, while the less refrangible remain. But this Light being  trajected only through the parallel Superficies of the two Prisms, if it  suffer'd any change by the Refraction of one Superficies it lost that  Impression by the contrary Refraction of the other Superficies, and so  being restor'd to its pristine Constitution, became of the same Nature  and Condition as at first before its Incidence on those Prisms; and  therefore, before its Incidence, was as much compounded of Rays  differently refrangible, as afterwards.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.]    _Illustration._ In the twenty second Figure ABC and BCD are the two  Prisms tied together in the form of a Parallelopiped, their Sides BC and  CB being contiguous, and their Sides AB and CD parallel. And HJK is the  third Prism, by which the Sun's Light propagated through the hole F into  the dark Chamber, and there passing through those sides of the Prisms  AB, BC, CB and CD, is refracted at O to the white Paper PT, falling  there partly upon P by a greater Refraction, partly upon T by a less  Refraction, and partly upon R and other intermediate places by  intermediate Refractions. By turning the Parallelopiped ACBD about its  Axis, according to the order of the Letters A, C, D, B, at length when  the contiguous Planes BC and CB become sufficiently oblique to the Rays  FM, which are incident upon them at M, there will vanish totally out of  the refracted Light OPT, first of all the most refracted Rays OP, (the  rest OR and OT remaining as before) then the Rays OR and other  intermediate ones, and lastly, the least refracted Rays OT. For when  the Plane BC becomes sufficiently oblique to the Rays incident upon it,  those Rays will begin to be totally reflected by it towards N; and first  the most refrangible Rays will be totally reflected (as was explained in  the preceding Experiment) and by Consequence must first disappear at P,  and afterwards the rest as they are in order totally reflected to N,  they must disappear in the same order at R and T. So then the Rays which  at O suffer the greatest Refraction, may be taken out of the Light MO  whilst the rest of the Rays remain in it, and therefore that Light MO is  compounded of Rays differently refrangible. And because the Planes AB  and CD are parallel, and therefore by equal and contrary Refractions  destroy one anothers Effects, the incident Light FM must be of the same  Kind and Nature with the emergent Light MO, and therefore doth also  consist of Rays differently refrangible. These two Lights FM and MO,  before the most refrangible Rays are separated out of the emergent Light  MO, agree in Colour, and in all other Properties so far as my  Observation reaches, and therefore are deservedly reputed of the same  Nature and Constitution, and by Consequence the one is compounded as  well as the other. But after the most refrangible Rays begin to be  totally reflected, and thereby separated out of the emergent Light MO,  that Light changes its Colour from white to a dilute and faint yellow, a  pretty good orange, a very full red successively, and then totally  vanishes. For after the most refrangible Rays which paint the Paper at  P with a purple Colour, are by a total Reflexion taken out of the beam  of Light MO, the rest of the Colours which appear on the Paper at R and  T being mix'd in the Light MO compound there a faint yellow, and after  the blue and part of the green which appear on the Paper between P and R  are taken away, the rest which appear between R and T (that is the  yellow, orange, red and a little green) being mixed in the beam MO  compound there an orange; and when all the Rays are by Reflexion taken  out of the beam MO, except the least refrangible, which at T appear of a  full red, their Colour is the same in that beam MO as afterwards at T,  the Refraction of the Prism HJK serving only to separate the differently  refrangible Rays, without making any Alteration in their Colours, as  shall be more fully proved hereafter. All which confirms as well the  first Proposition as the second.    _Scholium._ If this Experiment and the former be conjoined and made one  by"]]]
