[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/444"],[0,"System of Economical Contradictions; Or, The Philosophy of Misery (#8)"],[1,"formerly invoked  by religion and philosophy.  Determine, it tells us, the motives  of action (undoubtedly now old and worn-out) of which LUXURY is  historically the providential successor, and, from the  results of the former, calculate the effects of the latter.  Prove, in short, that Aristippus was only in advance of his  century, and that his system of morality must have its day, as  well as that of Zeno and A Kempis.    We are dealing, then, with a society which no longer wishes to be  poor; which mocks at everything that was once dear and sacred to  it,--liberty, religion, and glory,--so long as it has not wealth;  which, to obtain it, submits to all outrages, and becomes an  accomplice in all sorts of cowardly actions: and this burning  thirst for pleasure, this irresistible desire to arrive at  luxury,--a symptom of a new period in civilization,--is the  supreme commandment by virtue of which we are to labor for the  abolition of poverty: thus saith the Academy.  What becomes,  then, of the doctrine of expiation and abstinence, the morality  of sacrifice, resignation, and happy moderation?  What distrust  of the compensation promised in the other life, and what a  contradiction of the Gospel!  But, above all, what a  justification of a government which has adopted as its system the  golden key!  Why have religious men, Christians, Senecas, given  utterance in concert to so many immoral maxims?    The Academy, completing its thought, will reply to us:--    \"Show how the progress of criminal justice, in the prosecution  and punishment of attacks upon persons and property, follows and  marks the ages of civilization from the savage condition up to  that of the best- governed nations.\"    Is it possible that the criminal lawyers in the Academy of Moral  Sciences foresaw the conclusion of their premises?  The fact  whose history is now to be studied, and which the Academy  describes by the words \"progress of criminal justice,\" is simply  the gradual mitigation which manifests itself, both in the  forms of criminal examinations and in the penalties inflicted, in  proportion as civilization increases in liberty, light, and  wealth.  So that, the principle of repressive institutions being  the direct opposite of all those on which the welfare of society  depends, there is a constant elimination of all parts of the  penal system as well as all judicial paraphernalia, and the final  inference from this movement is that the guarantee of order lies  neither in fear nor punishment; consequently, neither in hell nor  religion.    What a subversion of received ideas!  What a denial of all that  it is the business of the Academy of Moral Sciences to defend!  But, if the guarantee of order no longer lies in the fear of a  punishment to be suffered, either in this life or in another,  where then are to be found the guarantees protective of persons  and property?  Or rather, without repressive institutions, what  becomes of property?  And without property, what becomes of the  family?    The Academy, which knows nothing of all these things, replies  without agitation:--    \"Review the various phases of the organization of the family upon  the soil of France from ancient times down to our day.\"    Which means:  Determine, by the previous progress of family  organization, the conditions of the existence of the family in a  state of equality of fortunes, voluntary and free association,  universal solidarity, material comfort and luxury, and public  order without prisons, courts, police, or hangmen.    There will be astonishment, perhaps, at finding that the Academy  of Moral and Political Sciences, after having, like the boldest  innovators, called in question all the principles of social  order,--religion, family, property, justice,--has not also  proposed this problem:  WHAT IS THE BEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT?  In fact, government is for society the source of all initiative,  every guarantee, every reform.  It would be, then, interesting to  know whether the government, as constituted by the Charter, is  adequate to the practical solution of the Academy's questions.    But it would be a misconception of the oracles to imagine that  they proceed by induction and analysis; and precisely because the  political problem was a condition or corollary of the  demonstrations asked for, the Academy could not offer it for  competition.  Such a conclusion would have opened its eyes, and,  without waiting for the memoirs of the competitors, it would have  hastened to suppress its entire programme.  The Academy has  approached the question from above.  It has said:--    The works of God are beautiful in their own essence, justificata  in semet ipsa; they are true, in a word, because they are his.  The thoughts of man resemble dense vapors pierced by long and  narrow flashes.  WHAT, THEN, IS THE TRUTH IN RELATION TO US, AND  WHAT IS THE CHARACTER OF CERTAINTY?    As if the Academy had said to us:  You shall verify the  hypothesis of your existence, the hypothesis of the Academy which  interrogates you, the hypotheses of time, space, motion, thought,  and the laws of thought.  Then you may verify the hypothesis of  pauperism, the hypothesis of inequality of conditions, the  hypothesis of universal association, the hypothesis of happiness,  the hypotheses of monarchy and republicanism, the hypothesis of  Providence! . . . .    A complete criticism of God and humanity.    I point to the programme of the honorable society: it is not I  who have fixed the conditions of my task, it is the Academy of  Moral and Political Sciences.  Now, how can I satisfy these  conditions, if I am not myself endowed with infallibility; in  a word, if I am not God or divine?  The Academy admits, then,  that divinity and humanity are identical, or at least  correlative; but the question now is in what consists this  correlation: such is the meaning of the problem of certainty,  such is the object of social philosophy.    Thus, then, in the name of the society that God inspires, an  Academy questions.    In the name of the same society, I am one of the prophets who  attempt to answer.  The task is an immense one, and I do not  promise to accomplish it:  I will go as far as God shall give me  strength.  But, whatever I may say, it does not come from me: the  thought which inspires my pen is not personal, and nothing that I  write can be attributed to me.  I shall give the facts as I have  seen them; I shall judge them by what I shall have said; I shall  call everything by its strongest name, and no one will take  offence.  I shall inquire freely, and by the rules of divination  which I have learned, into the meaning of the divine purpose  which is now expressing itself through the eloquent lips of sages  and the inarticulate wailings of the people: and, though I should  deny all the prerogatives guaranteed by our Constitution, I shall  not be factious.  I shall point my finger whither an invisible  influence is pushing us; and neither my action nor my words shall  be irritating.  I shall stir up the cloud, and, though I should  cause it to launch the thunderbolt, I should be innocent.  In  this solemn investigation to which the Academy invites me, I have  more than the right to tell the truth,--I have the right to say  what I think: may my thought, my words, and the truth be but one  and the same thing!    And you, reader,--for without a reader there is no writer,--you  are half of my work.  Without you, I am only sounding brass;  with the aid of your attention, I will speak marvels.  Do you see  this passing whirlwind called SOCIETY, from which burst forth,  with startling brilliancy, lightnings, thunders, and voices?  I  wish to cause you to place your finger on the hidden springs  which move it; but to that end you must reduce yourself at my  command to a state of pure intelligence.  The eyes of love and  pleasure are powerless to recognize beauty in a skeleton, harmony  in naked viscera, life in dark and coagulated blood: consequently  the secrets of the social organism are a sealed letter to the man  whose brain is beclouded by passion and prejudice.  Such  sublimities are unattainable except by cold and silent  contemplation.  Suffer me, then, before revealing to your eyes  the leaves of the book of life, to prepare your soul by this  sceptical purification which the great teachers of the  people--Socrates, Jesus Christ, St. Paul, St. Remi, Bacon,  Descartes, Galileo, Kant, etc.--have always claimed of their  disciples.    Whoever you may be, clad in the rags of misery or decked in the  sumptuous vestments of luxury, I restore you to that state of  luminous nudity which neither the fumes of wealth nor the poisons  of envious poverty dim.  How persuade the rich that the  difference of conditions arises from an error in the accounts;  and how can the poor, in their beggary, conceive that the  proprietor possesses in good faith?  To investigate the  sufferings of the laborer is to the idler the most intolerable of  amusements; just as to do justice to the fortunate is to the  miserable the bitterest of draughts.    You occupy a high position:  I strip you of it; there you are,  free.  There is too much optimism beneath this official costume,  too much subordination, too much idleness.  Science demands an  insurrection of thought: now, the thought of an official is his  salary.    Your mistress, beautiful, passionate, artistic, is, I like to  believe, possessed only by you.  That is, your soul, your spirit,  your conscience, have passed into the most charming object of  luxury that nature and art have produced for the eternal torment  of fascinated mortals.  I separate you from this divine half of  yourself: at the present day it is too much to wish for justice  and at the same time to love a woman.  To think with grandeur and  clearness, man must remove the lining of his nature and hold to  his masculine hypostasis.  Besides, in the state in which I have  put"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44414"],[0,"The Mormon Prophet and His Harem (#8)"],[1,"in keeping the good-will  of his trading customers; and this fact, together with his undoubted  sympathy with the church, will satisfactorily account for the course  pursued by him in the complicated condition of the Territory.    It is not our purpose to detract from the merits of any one. We desire  to do justice to all. But the impartial truth of history requires us to  say that the uniform course of Judge Kinney has been to aid and abet  Brigham Young in his ambitious schemes, with but little regard to the  advancement of the interests of the whole country, or the requirements  of indiscriminate justice.    As to his merits as a jurist, the writer of these pages cannot undertake  to decide. But it would seem, to one uninitiated, that a Judge cannot be  very profound who will try, convict, and sentence men not within the  jurisdiction of his court, and even men not in the land of the living.  This was done by Judge Kinney, in the case of the  Morrisites,--dissenters or apostates from the Mormon Church.    In the spring of 1863 a large number of these men were tried, convicted,  and fined $100 each. Many of them were out of the Territory at the time,  and one was dead. This statement is fully substantiated by affidavits  which were taken at the time. Over ninety were tried and convicted,  about twenty of whom were out of the Territory, and one had died before  the trial commenced.    When the cases were called on for trial, it was stated that some of the  accused were absent. The Judge remarked, it made no difference; he was  gratified that so many had made their appearance, and directed the trial  to proceed. All were found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine of $100  each, except a few of the leaders, who were sentenced to the  penitentiary,--one of them for fifteen years.    These men were accused of resisting the Mormon officers who came to  arrest them. Robert T. Burton, the sheriff of Salt Lake County, who was  the principal one thus \"resisted,\" had shot Morris, their Prophet, in  cold blood, after he and his party had surrendered; and yet, while the  Morrisites were so severely punished, Burton went scot free. The grand  jury of Salt Lake County would not even find a bill of indictment  against him. Burton stands high in the community, and was afterwards  appointed Collector of Internal Revenue.    But this is not all. Not only were all of the accused tried and  convicted, but the bonds of those absent were declared _by the clerk_ to  be forfeited, and execution was issued against those resident in Utah,  to collect the penalty of the bonds. At the same time, _the records  showed no judgments against the delinquents_. One of these Morrisites,  named Abraham Taylor, found his property, worth $2500, suddenly levied  upon, under one of these executions. There being no gentile lawyer at  Salt Lake, he applied to Judge Waite, who investigated the matter, and  found there was no judgment of record. He then advised Mr. Taylor to  apply to Judge Kinney for an injunction against the officer. This was  done; but the application was refused by Judge K. _on the ground that if  there was no judgment he could render one, as the court had not  permanently adjourned, but only to meet on his own motion_. This  response to the application of a suitor is a sufficient indication of  the ability of Judge Kinney, and of his desire to administer impartial  justice.    The result of the whole matter was, that the homestead of Mr. Taylor was  sold under the execution, _to the clerk of Judge Kinney's court, for  $200_; the family of Taylor impoverished, and literally turned into the  street. After remaining out of doors, in front of the house, for a day  or two, they took refuge at the camp of Gen. Connor.    In his personal appearance Judge Kinney is pompous and conceited. He is  of the medium size, rather stout, with dark complexion. Brusque and  ready in conversation, and never declining to drink when invited, he is  well adapted to the country in which he resides, and is immensely  popular in the community in which he was placed \"to administer the law,\"  and which he now represents in Congress. He is an open apologist and  advocate of polygamy.    Mrs. Kinney is a sister of Judge Hall, of Iowa, and an accomplished  lady. She was utterly disgusted with Mormon society, and returned, with  her daughters, to the States.    Judge Kinney remained in Utah until 1856. In 1860 he was reappointed.  Thus he was absent from the Territory during all the exciting scenes of  1857-8 and 9, and returned after something like harmony had been  restored in the affairs of the Territory. He managed, however, by having  his leave of absence extended from time to time, to retain the office  and its emoluments until 1858. Since 1860 he has been back and forth,  spending about half his time in either portion of the country, but  retaining his position as Chief Justice, until elected to Congress in  1863.    Judge Stiles, who was appointed to succeed Snow, was assigned to the  third, or Carson District. He immediately proceeded to his district, and  held a term of court.    The present Territory of Nevada was included mostly in the third  judicial district, and much difficulty occurred between Mormons and the  miners in that section.    A full account of the proceedings which go to make up the history of  this part of Utah, will be found in a letter from the Hon. James M.  Crane to Hon. William Smith, published in 1859.    This letter is so complete and truthful in its statements, and presents  such a correct view of the character and tendencies of Mormonism, that  we insert it, nearly entire:--         \"WASHINGTON, January 17, 1859.         \"DEAR SIR,--         \"As you may need some facts not reported at length in the       memorial and other documents, relating to the proposed       Territory of Nevada, I herewith submit them.         \"The Mormons and Anti-Mormons began the settlement of Western       Utah in the latter part of 1854. The former, however,       succeeded, in 1855, in obtaining a numerical majority; and the       Legislature of Utah, on being informed of this fact, organized       the whole western part of the Territory, under the name of       Carson County, and Governor Young appointed Orson Hyde, the       President of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, its Probate Judge.       Soon after the Judge arrived, adventurers from California, as       well as from the Atlantic States, settled in Carson and other       valleys on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, for the       purpose of mining, farming, and raising stock. As they       increased very fast, the Mormons became alarmed, and       determined to expel them.         \"They therefore ordered them to leave the country. Of course       the Christians, or Anti-Mormons refused to do so. The Mormons       then assembled their forces, and attempted to expel them, _vi       et armis_. The Anti-Mormons also organized, and fortified       themselves, with a view of defending their lives and property       against their assailants.         \"For two weeks their armies camped nearly in sight of each       other, without coming to a direct battle.         \"By this time, news had reached the miners in California of       this state of affairs, and a large number had determined to       cross the mountains, and afford protection to the       Anti-Mormons. On hearing this, the Mormons became satisfied       that, unless they retraced their steps, they would be driven       themselves from the country, instead of the Anti-Mormons. They       therefore proposed a truce, and agreed that all should enjoy a       common heritage in that part of the Territory.         \"The Mormons now became satisfied that the Christians not only       could, but would occupy these fertile valleys, on the ground       that they were the common property of the United States. When       the Legislature of Utah heard of this affair, that body, in       violation of every constitutional right, repealed the county       organization, recalled the Probate Judge, and removed all the       county and court records to Salt Lake City, where they have       ever since remained. Amongst these records were several       indictments against certain persons for high crimes and       misdemeanors. By this flagrant violation of all sacred,       individual, collective, and constitutional rights, the people       of Western Utah were not only denied all legal protection to       life and property, but they were disfranchised. They have ever       been unrepresented in the Legislature and in Congress. The       history of our country presents no such a record of open       defiance of law, and such cruelties to men under the form of       laws.         \"For years the Anti-Mormons have been applying, both to the       Territorial Legislature and to Congress, for protection,       without success.         \"Their situation has ever been, and still is, peculiarly       unsafe and annoying. Recently a Probate Judge was       surreptitiously appointed for Carson Valley, with a view of       reorganizing the county of Carson, and thus extend over the       people there the Mormon statutes of the Territory.         \"The Judge, soon after he received his commission, undertook       to force on an election of county officers. Enough of the       Anti-Mormons, however, turned out, to defeat his purpose, by       the election of an opposite ticket, who, on being elected,       refused to qualify, because they were required to obey the       Mormon statutes. The Judge has been notified that if he       undertakes to enforce the Mormon statutes he will be       resisted,--peaceably if they can, forcibly if they must.         \"They will not introduce, nor permit others to introduce among       them, the vices of that wicked, perverse, and adulterous       generation, who have so long wielded the sceptre of authority       in the Great"]]]
