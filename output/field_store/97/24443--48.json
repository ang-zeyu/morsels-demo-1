[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4699"],[0,"We of the Never-Never (#8)"],[1," Mac's tent, that he was obliged to  pass most of the night perched on a pyramid of pack bags and saddles.        Unfortunately, in the confusion and darkness, the dish of Johnny  cakes became the base of the pyramid, and was consequently missing at  breakfast time. After a long hunt Mac recovered it and stood looking  dejectedly at the ruins of his cookery--a heap of flat, stodgy-looking  slabs. \"Must have been sitting on 'em all night,\" he said, \"and there's  no other bread for breakfast.\"    There was no doubt that we must eat them or go without bread of any  kind; but as we sat tugging at the gluey guttapercha-like substance,  Mac's sense of humour revived. \"Didn't I tell you I was slap-up at  Johnny cakes?\" he chuckled, adding with further infinitely more humorous  chuckles: \"You mightn't think it; but I really am.\" Then he pointed to  Jackeroo, who was watching in bewilderment while the Maluka hunted for  the crispest crust, not for himself, but the woman. \"White fellow big  fellow fool all right! eh, Jackeroo?\" he asked, and Jackeroo openly  agreed with us.    Finding the black soil flats impassable after the deluge, Mac left the  track, having decided to stick to the ridges all day; and all that had  gone before was smoothness itself in comparison to what was in store.    All day the buck-board rocked and bumped through the timber, and the  Maluka, riding behind, from time to time pointed out the advantages  of travelling across country, as we bounced about the buck-board like  rubber balls: \"There's so little chance of getting stiff with sitting  still.\"    Every time we tried to answer him we bit our tongues as the buck-board  leapt over the tussocks of grass. Once we managed to call back, \"You  won't feel the journey in a buck-board.\" Then an overhanging bough  threatening to wipe us out of our seats, Mac shouted, \"Duck!\" and as we  \"ducked\" the buck-board skimmed between two trees, with barely an inch  to spare.    \"I'm a bit of a Jehu all right!\" Mac shouted triumphantly. \"It takes  judgment to do the thing in style\"; and the next moment, swinging round  a patch of scrub, we flew off at a tangent to avoid a fallen tree,  crashing through its branches and grinding over an out-crop of ironstone  to miss a big boulder just beyond the tree. It undoubtedly took judgment  this \"travelling across country along the ridges\"; but the keen, alert  bushman never hesitated as he swung in and out and about the timber,  only once miscalculating the distance between trees, when he was obliged  to back out again. Of course we barked trees constantly, but Mac called  that \"blazing a track for the next travellers,\" and everywhere the bush  creatures scurried out of our way; and when I expressed fears for the  springs, Mac reassured me by saying a buck-board had none, excepting  those under the seat.    If Mac was a \"bit of a Jehu,\" he certainly was a \"dead homer,\" for after  miles of scrub and grass and timber, we came out at our evening camp at  the Bitter Springs, to find the Head Stockman there, with his faithful,  tawny-coloured shadow, \"Old Sool em,\" beside him.    Dog and man greeted us sedately, and soon Dan had a billy boiling for  us, and a blazing fire, and accepted an invitation to join us at supper  and \"bring something in the way of bread along with him.\"    With a commonplace remark about the trip out, he placed a crisp, newly  baked damper on the tea-towel that acted as supper cloth; but when we  all agreed that he was \"real slap-up at damper making,\" he scented a  joke and shot a quick, questioning glance around; then deciding that it  was wiser not to laugh at all than to laugh in the wrong place, he only  said, he was \"not a bad hand at the damper trick.\" Dan liked his jokes  well labelled when dealing with the unknown Woman.    He was a bushman of the old type, one of the men of the droving days;  full of old theories, old faiths, and old prejudices, and clinging  always to old habits and methods. Year by year as the bush had receded  and shrunk before the railways, he had receded with it, keeping  always just behind the Back of Beyond, droving, bullock-punching,  stock-keeping, and unconsciously opening up the way for that very  civilisation that was driving him farther and farther back. In the forty  years since his boyhood railways had driven him out of Victoria,  New South Wales and Queensland, and were now threatening even the  Never-Never, and Dan was beginning to fear that they would not leave  \"enough bush to bury a man in.\"    Enough bush to bury a man in! That's all these men of the droving days  have ever asked of their nation and yet without them the pioneers would  have been tied hand and foot, and because of them Australia is what it  is.    \"Had a good trip out?\" Dan asked, feeling safe on that subject, and  appeared to listen to the details of the road with interest; but all the  time the shrewd hazel eyes were upon me, drawing rapid conclusions, and  I began to feel absurdly anxious to know their verdict. That was not to  come before bedtime; and only those who knew the life of the stations in  the Never-Never know how much was depending on the stockmen's verdict.    Dan had his own methods of dealing with the Unknown Woman. Forty years  out-bush had convinced him that \"most of 'em were the right sort,\" but  it had also convinced him that \"you had to take 'em all differently,\"  and he always felt his way carefully, watching and waiting, ready to  open out at the first touch of fellowship and understanding, but just as  ready to withdraw into himself at the faintest approach to a snub.    By the time supper was over he had risked a joke or two, and taking  heart by their reception, launched boldly into the conversation,  chuckling with delight as the Maluka and Mac amused themselves by  examining the missus on bushcraft.    \"She'll need a deal of educating before we let her out alone,\" he said,  after a particularly bad failure, with the first touch of that air of  proprietorship that was to become his favourite attitude towards his  missus.    \"It's only common sense; you'll soon get used to it,\" Mac said in  encouragement, giving us one of his delightful backhanders. Then in all  seriousness Dan suggested teaching her some of the signs of water  at hand, right off, \"in case she does get lost any time,\" and also  seriously, the Maluka and Mac \"thought it would be as well, perhaps.\"    Then the townswoman's self-satisfied arrogance came to the surface. \"You  needn't bother about me,\" I said, confident I had as much common sense  as any bushman. \"If ever I do get lost, I'll just catch a cow and milk  it.\"    Knowing nothing of the wild, scared cattle of the fenceless runs of the  Never-Never, I was prepared for anything rather than the roar of delight  that greeted that example of town \"common sense.\"    \"Missus! missus!\" the Maluka cried, as soon as he could speak, \"you'll  need a deal of educating \"; and while Mac gasped, \"Oh I say! Look here!\"  Dan, with tears in his eyes, chuckled: \"She'll have a drouth on by the  time she runs one down.\" Dan always called a thirst a drouth. \"Oh Lord!\"  he said, picturing the scene in his mind's eye, \"'I'll catch a cow and  milk it,' she says.\"    Then, dancing with fun, the hazel eyes looked round the company, and as  Dan rose, preparatory to turning in, we felt we were about to hear their  verdict. When it came it was characteristic of the man in uniqueness of  wording:    \"She's the dead finish!\" he said, wiping his eyes on his shirt sleeve.  \"Reckoned she was the minute I heard her talking about slap-up dampers\";  and in some indescribable way we knew he had paid the woman who was just  entering his life the highest compliment in his power. Then he added,  \"Told the chaps the little 'uns were generally all right.\" It is the  helplessness of little women that makes them appear \"all right\" in the  eyes of bushmen, helplessness being foreign to snorters.    At breakfast Dan expressed surprise because there was no milk, and the  pleasantry being well received, he considered the moment ripe for one of  his pet theories.    \"She'll do for this place!\" he said, wagging his head wisely. \"I've been  forty years out-bush, and I've known eight or ten women in that time,  so I ought to know something about it. Anyway, the ones that could see  jokes suited best. There was Mrs. Bob out Victoria way. She'd see a joke  a mile off; sighted 'em as soon as they got within cooee. Never knew her  miss one, and never knew anybody suit the bush like she did.\" And, as  we packed up and set out for the last lap of our journey he was still  ambling about his theory. \"Yes,\" he said, \"you can dodge most things out  bush; but you can't dodge jokes for long. They'll run you down sooner  or later\"; adding with a chuckle, \"Never heard of one running Mrs. Bob  down, though. She always tripped 'em up before they could get to her.\"  Then finding the missus had thrown away a \"good cup of tea just because  a few flies had got into it,\" he became grave. \"Never heard of Mrs. Bob  getting up to those tricks,\" he said, and doubted whether \"the missus'ld  do after all,\" until reassured by the Maluka that \"she'll be fishing  them out with the indifference of a Stoic in a week or two\"; and I was.    When within a few miles of the homestead, the buckboard took a sharp  turn round a patch of scrub, and before any one realised what was  happening we were in the midst of a mob of pack horses, and face to face  with the Quiet Stockman a strong, erect, young Scot, who carried his six  foot two of bone and muscle with the lithe ease of a bushman.    \"Hallo\" Mac shouted, pulling up. Then, with the air of a showman  introducing some rare exhibit, added: \"This is the missus, Jack.\"    Jack touched his hat and moved uneasily in his saddle, answering Mac's  questions in monosyllables. Then the Maluka came up, and Mac, taking  pity on the embarrassed bushman, suggested \"getting along,\" and we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470"],[0,"Heretics (#8)"],[1,"and civilizations, this does not in itself convince one that he  sees things as they are. I should be most effectively convinced that he  did if I found him staring with religious astonishment at his own feet.  \"What are those two beautiful and industrious beings,\" I can imagine  him murmuring to himself, \"whom I see everywhere, serving me I know not  why? What fairy godmother bade them come trotting out of elfland when I  was born?  What god of the borderland, what barbaric god of legs, must  I propitiate with fire and wine, lest they run away with me?\"    The truth is, that all genuine appreciation rests on a certain mystery  of humility and almost of darkness.  The man who said, \"Blessed is he  that expecteth nothing, for he shall not be disappointed,\" put the  eulogy quite inadequately and even falsely.  The truth \"Blessed is he  that expecteth nothing, for he shall be gloriously surprised.\" The man  who expects nothing sees redder roses than common men can see, and  greener grass, and a more startling sun.  Blessed is he that expecteth  nothing, for he shall possess the cities and the mountains; blessed is  the meek, for he shall inherit the earth.  Until we realize that things  might not be we cannot realize that things are. Until we see the  background of darkness we cannot admire the light as a single and  created thing.  As soon as we have seen that darkness, all light is  lightening, sudden, blinding, and divine. Until we picture nonentity we  underrate the victory of God, and can realize none of the trophies of  His ancient war. It is one of the million wild jests of truth that we  know nothing until we know nothing.    Now this is, I say deliberately, the only defect in the greatness of  Mr. Shaw, the only answer to his claim to be a great man, that he is  not easily pleased.  He is an almost solitary exception to the general  and essential maxim, that little things please great minds. And from  this absence of that most uproarious of all things, humility, comes  incidentally the peculiar insistence on the Superman. After belabouring  a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr.  Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very  doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be  progressive at all.  Having come to doubt whether humanity can be  combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected  to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being  easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations  and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is  incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new  kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man.  It is rather as if a  nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on  discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food  and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a  new baby. Mr. Shaw cannot understand that the thing which is valuable  and lovable in our eyes is man--the old beer-drinking, creed-making,  fighting, failing, sensual, respectable man. And the things that have  been founded on this creature immortally remain; the things that have  been founded on the fancy of the Superman have died with the dying  civilizations which alone have given them birth. When Christ at a  symbolic moment was establishing His great society, He chose for its  corner-stone neither the brilliant Paul nor the mystic John, but a  shuffler, a snob a coward--in a word, a man. And upon this rock He has  built His Church, and the gates of Hell have not prevailed against it.  All the empires and the kingdoms have failed, because of this inherent  and continual weakness, that they were founded by strong men and upon  strong men. But this one thing, the historic Christian Church, was  founded on a weak man, and for that reason it is indestructible. For no  chain is stronger than its weakest link.        V. Mr. H. G. Wells and the Giants    We ought to see far enough into a hypocrite to see even his sincerity.  We ought to be interested in that darkest and most real part of a man  in which dwell not the vices that he does not display, but the virtues  that he cannot.  And the more we approach the problems of human history  with this keen and piercing charity, the smaller and smaller space we  shall allow to pure hypocrisy of any kind. The hypocrites shall not  deceive us into thinking them saints; but neither shall they deceive us  into thinking them hypocrites. And an increasing number of cases will  crowd into our field of inquiry, cases in which there is really no  question of hypocrisy at all, cases in which people were so ingenuous  that they seemed absurd, and so absurd that they seemed disingenuous.    There is one striking instance of an unfair charge of hypocrisy. It is  always urged against the religious in the past, as a point of  inconsistency and duplicity, that they combined a profession of almost  crawling humility with a keen struggle for earthly success and  considerable triumph in attaining it.  It is felt as a piece of humbug,  that a man should be very punctilious in calling himself a miserable  sinner, and also very punctilious in calling himself King of France.  But the truth is that there is no more conscious inconsistency between  the humility of a Christian and the rapacity of a Christian than there  is between the humility of a lover and the rapacity of a lover. The  truth is that there are no things for which men will make such  herculean efforts as the things of which they know they are unworthy.  There never was a man in love who did not declare that, if he strained  every nerve to breaking, he was going to have his desire. And there  never was a man in love who did not declare also that he ought not to  have it.  The whole secret of the practical success of Christendom lies  in the Christian humility, however imperfectly fulfilled. For with the  removal of all question of merit or payment, the soul is suddenly  released for incredible voyages.  If we ask a sane man how much he  merits, his mind shrinks instinctively and instantaneously. It is  doubtful whether he merits six feet of earth. But if you ask him what  he can conquer--he can conquer the stars. Thus comes the thing called  Romance, a purely Christian product. A man cannot deserve adventures;  he cannot earn dragons and hippogriffs. The mediaeval Europe which  asserted humility gained Romance; the civilization which gained Romance  has gained the habitable globe. How different the Pagan and Stoical  feeling was from this has been admirably expressed in a famous  quotation.  Addison makes the great Stoic say--      \"'Tis not in mortals to command success;     But we'll do more, Sempronius, we'll deserve it.\"    But the spirit of Romance and Christendom, the spirit which is in every  lover, the spirit which has bestridden the earth with European  adventure, is quite opposite.  'Tis not in mortals to deserve success.  But we'll do more, Sempronius; we'll obtain it.    And this gay humility, this holding of ourselves lightly and yet ready  for an infinity of unmerited triumphs, this secret is so simple that  every one has supposed that it must be something quite sinister and  mysterious. Humility is so practical a virtue that men think it must be  a vice. Humility is so successful that it is mistaken for pride. It is  mistaken for it all the more easily because it generally goes with a  certain simple love of splendour which amounts to vanity. Humility will  always, by preference, go clad in scarlet and gold; pride is that which  refuses to let gold and scarlet impress it or please it too much.  In a  word, the failure of this virtue actually lies in its success; it is  too successful as an investment to be believed in as a virtue.  Humility is not merely too good for this world; it is too practical for  this world; I had almost said it is too worldly for this world.    The instance most quoted in our day is the thing called the humility of  the man of science; and certainly it is a good instance as well as a  modern one.  Men find it extremely difficult to believe that a man who  is obviously uprooting mountains and dividing seas, tearing down  temples and stretching out hands to the stars, is really a quiet old  gentleman who only asks to be allowed to indulge his harmless old hobby  and follow his harmless old nose. When a man splits a grain of sand and  the universe is turned upside down in consequence, it is difficult to  realize that to the man who did it, the splitting of the grain is the  great affair, and the capsizing of the cosmos quite a small one.  It is  hard to enter into the feelings of a man who regards a new heaven and a  new earth in the light of a by-product. But undoubtedly it was to this  almost eerie innocence of the intellect that the great men of the great  scientific period, which now appears to be closing, owed their enormous  power and triumph. If they had brought the heavens down like a house of  cards their plea was not even that they had done it on principle; their  quite unanswerable plea was that they had done it by accident. Whenever  there was in them the least touch of pride in what they had done, there  was a good ground for attacking them; but so long as they were wholly  humble, they were wholly victorious. There were possible answers to  Huxley; there was no answer possible to Darwin.  He was convincing  because of his unconsciousness; one might almost say because of his  dulness.  This childlike and prosaic mind is beginning to wane in the  world of science. Men of science are beginning to see themselves, as  the fine phrase is, in the part; they are beginning to be proud of  their humility. They are beginning to be aesthetic, like the rest of  the world, beginning to spell truth with a capital T, beginning to talk  of the creeds they"]]]
