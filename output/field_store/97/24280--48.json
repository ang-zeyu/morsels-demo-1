CRANIAL OSTEOLOGY      The frogs of the _Hyla microcephala_ group have a minimal amount  of cranial ossification as compared to more generalized hylid skulls,  such as _Smilisca_ (Duellman and Trueb, 1966). In the _Hyla  microcephala_ group the sphenethmoid is small and short, and a large  frontoparietal fontanelle is present. The quadratojugal exists only  as a small spur and is not in contact with the maxillary. The prootics  are poorly developed. The anterior and posterior arms of the squamosal  are short; the anterior arm extends no more than one-fourth of the  distance to the maxillary, and the posterior arm does not have a bony  connection with the prootic. The nasal lacks a maxillary process, and  the medial ramus of the pterygoid lacks a bony connection to the  prootic.    Teeth are absent on the parasphenoid and palatines, but present on the  maxillaries, premaxillaries, and prevomers. The teeth are simple,  pointed, and slightly curved. Although the number of teeth varies  (Table 3), no consistent differences between the species are apparent.

Both x 12.]      Despite the great reduction in the ossification of the cranial  elements, certain apparently consistent differences exist between the  species seem to be consistent. The most notable differences are:  1) amount of ossification of the frontoparietals and consequent shape  and size of the frontoparietal fontanelle, 2) shape of the nasals,  3) shape and extent of the sphenethmoid, and 4) shape of the columella  (Table 4, Figs. 5-6). On the basis of these characters, _Hyla  microcephala_ can be set apart from the other species and characterized  as having a poorly ossified frontoparietal and correspondingly large  frontoparietal fontanelle; long, slender, arcuate nasals; extremely  short sphenethmoid; and expanded distal end of the columella. The other  species in the group (_phlebodes_, _robertmertensi_, and _sartori_)  have more ossification of the frontoparietals, broader nasals, only a  moderately short sphenethmoid, and an unexpanded distal end of the  columella. Among these three species, the skulls of _phlebodes_ and  _robertmertensi_ are most nearly alike, whereas the skull of _sartori_  differs by having a differently shaped frontoparietal fontanelle,  broader nasals, and an ossified anterior extension of the sphenethmoid  between the nasals (compare Fig. 5b with Fig. 6 a-b).    Although all skulls examined belong to breeding adults, the extent of  the ossification of the frontoparietals and the resulting shape of the  frontoparietal fontanelle might be correlated with the age of the frog.  Nevertheless, in the 24 skulls of _Hyla microcephala_ examined, the  frontoparietals are less extensively ossified than in the skulls of the  other species. The trivial differences among the other three species  certainly are suggestive of close relationship, but on the basis of  present knowledge of the evolutionary trends in hylid cranial  osteology, the differences offer little evidence for determining  phylogenetic lineage.          ANALYSIS OF MATING CALLS      Calls of all five taxa were compared in several characteristics, of  which three are deemed most significant systematically. These are  1) the pattern and duration of the notes of a call-group, 2) the  fundamental frequency, and 3) the dominant frequency. Air temperatures  were noted at the time the calls were recorded, but no valid  correlation could be determined between this factor and any of the  parameters of the calls; consequently recordings made at all  temperatures (21-29 deg. C.) were grouped together.    _Pattern and duration of notes._--In all five taxa the basic pattern  consists of a call-group made up of one primary note followed by a  series of shorter secondary notes. In some species the secondary notes  differ from the primary in other characteristics. Both subspecies of  _Hyla microcephala_ have a long, unpaired primary note followed by 0  to 18 (usually about 4) somewhat shorter paired secondary notes. In  calls of _Hyla m. microcephala_ the mean duration of the primary is  0.131 (0.10-0.16) second and that of the secondaries is 0.101  (0.05-0.14) second, whereas in _H. m. underwoodi_ the mean duration of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34607"],[0,"Woodcraft and Camping (#8)"],[1,"lengths of  twenty to thirty feet, because it was easier to lay them on the fire and  burn them in two than to cut them shorter with light hatchets. With a  heavy axe, we should have cut them to lengths of five or six feet.    [Sidenote: _Our Luck_]    Our luck, I may mention, was good--as good as we desired. Not that four  smallish deer are anything to brag about for a week's hunt by four men  and two dogs. I have known a pot-hunter to kill nine in a single day.  But we had enough.    As it was, we were obliged to \"double trip it\" in order to get our deer  and duffle down to \"Babb's.\" And we gave away more than half our  venison. For the rest, the illustrations show the camp-fire--all but the  fire--as it should be made.          Chapter V         FISHING, WITH AND WITHOUT FLIES--SOME TACKLE AND       LURES--DISCURSIVE REMARKS ON THE GENTLE ART--THE       HEADLIGHT--FROGGING      There is probably no subject connected with out-door sport so thoroughly  and exhaustively written up as fly-fishing, and all that pertains  thereto. Fly-fishing for speckled trout always, and deservedly, takes  the lead. Bass fishing usually comes next, though some writers accord  second place to the lake trout, salmon trout or land-locked salmon. The  mascalonge, as a game fish, is scarcely behind the small-mouthed bass,  and is certainly more gamy than the lake trout. The large-mouthed bass  and pickerel are usually ranked about with the yellow perch. I don't  know why; they are certainly gamy enough. Perhaps it is because they do  not leap out of water when hooked. Both are good on the table.    A dozen able and interesting authors have written books wherein trout,  flies and fly-fishing are treated in a manner that leaves an old  backwoodsman little to say. Rods, reels, casting lines, flies and fish  are described and descanted on in a way, and in a language, the reading  whereof reduces me to temporary insanity. And yet I seem to recollect  some bygone incidents concerning fish and fishing. I have a well-defined  notion that I once stood on Flat Rock, in Big Pine Creek, and caught  over 350 fine trout in a short day's fishing. Also that many times I  left home on a bright May or June morning, walked eight miles, caught a  twelve-pound creel of trout, and walked home before bed-time.    I remember that once, in Michigan, on the advice of local fishermen, I  dragged a spoon around High Bank Lake two days, with little result save  half a dozen blisters on my hands; and that on the next morning, taking  a long tamarack pole and my own way of fishing, I caught, before 10 A.  M., fifty pounds of bass and pickerel, weighing from two to ten pounds  each.    Gibson, whose spoon, line and skiff I had been using and who was the  fishing oracle of that region, could hardly believe his eyes. I kept  that country inn, and the neighborhood as well, supplied with fish for  the next two weeks.    It is truth to say that I have never struck salt or fresh waters, where  edible fish were at all plentiful, without being able to take, in some  way, all that I needed. Notably and preferably with the fly if that  might be. If not, then with worms, grubs, minnows, grasshoppers,  crickets, or any sort of doodle bug their highnesses might affect. When  a plump, two-pound trout refuses to eat a tinseled, feathered fraud, I  am not the man to refuse him something more edible.    That I may not be misunderstood, let me say that I recognized the  speckled brook trout as the very emperor of all game fish, and angling  for him with the fly as the neatest, most fascinating sport attainable  by the angler. But there are thousands of outers who, from choice or  necessity, take their summer vacations where _Salmo fontinalis_ is not  to be had. They would prefer him, either on the leader or the table; but  he is not there; \"And a man has got a stomach, and we live by what we  eat.\"    Wherefore, they go a-fishing for other fish. So that they are successful  and sufficiently fed, the difference is not so material. I have enjoyed  myself hugely catching catties on a dark night from a skiff with a  hand-line.    I can add nothing in a scientific way to the literature of fly-fishing;  but I can give a few hints that may be conducive to practical success,  as well with trout as with less noble fish. In fly-fishing, one  serviceable four-ounce rod is enough; and a plain click reel, of small  size, is just as satisfactory as a more costly affair. Twenty yards of  tapered, water-proof line, with a six-foot leader, and a cost of two  flies, complete the rig, and will be found sufficient. In common with  most fly-fishers, I have mostly thrown a cast of three flies, but have  found two just as effective, and handier.    [Sidenote: _The Best Flies_]    We all carry too many flies. Some of my friends have more than sixty  dozen, and will never use a tenth of them. In the summer of '88, finding  I had more than seemed needful, I left all but four dozen behind me. I  wet only fifteen of them in a seven weeks' outing. And they filled the  bill. I have no time or space for a dissertation on the hundreds of  different flies made and sold at the present day. Abler pens have done  that. I will, however, name a few that I have found good in widely  different localities, i.e., the Northern Wilderness of New York and the  upper waters of Northern Pennsylvania. For the Northern Wilderness:  Scarlet ibis, split ibis, Romeyn, white-winged coachman, royal coachman,  red hackle, red-bodied ashy and gray-bodied ashy. The ashies were good  for black bass also. For Northern Pennsylvania: Queen of the waters,  professor, red fox, coachman, black may, white-winged coachman, wasp,  brown hackle, Seth Green. Ibis flies are worthless here. Using the dark  flies in bright water and clear weather, and the brighter colors for  evening, the list was long enough.    At the commencement of the open season, and until the young maple leaves  are half grown, bait will be found far more successful than the fly. At  this time the trout are pretty evenly distributed along lake shores and  streams, choosing to lie quietly in rather deep pools, and avoiding  swift water. A few may rise to the fly in a logy, indifferent way; but  the best way to take them is bait-fishing with well-cleansed angle-worms  or white grubs, the latter being the best bait I have ever tried. They  take the bait sluggishly at this season, but, on feeling the hook, wake  up to their normal activity and fight gamely to the last. When young,  new-born insects begin to drop freely on the water about the 20th of  May, trout leave the pools and take to the riffles. And from this time  until the latter part of June the fly-fisherman is in his glory. It may  be true that the skillful bait-fisherman will rather beat his creel. He  cares not for that. He can take enough; and he had rather take ten trout  with the fly than a score with bait. As for the man who goes a-fishing  simply to catch fish, the fly-fisher does not recognize him as an angler  at all.    When the sun is hot and the weather grows warm, trout leave the ripples  and take to cold springs and spring-holes; the largest fish, of course,  monopolizing the deepest and coolest places, while the smaller ones  hover around, or content themselves with shallower water. As the weather  gets hotter, the fly-fishing falls off badly. A few trout of four to  eight ounces in weight may still be raised, but the larger ones are  lying on the bottom, and are not to be fooled with feathers. They will  take a tempting bait when held before their noses--sometimes; at other  times, not. As to raising them with a fly--as well attempt to raise a  sick Indian with the temperance pledge. And yet, they may be taken in  bright daylight by a ruse that I learned long ago, of a youngster less  than half my age, a little, freckled, thin-visaged young man, whose  health was evidently affected by a daily struggle with a pair of  tow-colored side whiskers and a light mustache. There was hardly enough  of the whole affair to make a door-mat for a bee hive. But he seemed so  proud of the plant, that I forebore to rig him. He was better than he  looked--as often happens. The landlord said, \"He brings in large trout  every day, when our best fly-fishermen fail.\" One night, around an  out-door fire, we got acquainted, and I found him a witty, pleasant  companion. Before turning in I ventured to ask him how he succeeded in  taking large trout, while the experts only caught small ones, or failed  altogether.    \"Go with me tomorrow morning to a spring-hole three miles up the river,  and I'll show you,\" he said.    [Sidenote: _At the Spring-Hole_]    Of course, we went. He, rowing a light skiff, and I paddling a still  lighter canoe. The spring-hole was in a narrow bay that set back from  the river, and at the mouth of a cold, clear brook; it was ten to twelve  feet deep, and at the lower end a large balsam had fallen in with the  top in just the right place for getting away with large fish, or  tangling lines and leaders. We moored some twenty feet above the  spring-hole, and commenced fishing, I with my favorite cast of flies, my  friend with the tail of a minnow. He caught a 1-1/2-pound trout almost  at the outset, but I got no rise; did not expect it. Then I went above,  where the water was shallower, and raised a couple of half-pounders, but  could get no more. I thought he had better go to the hotel with what he  had, but my friend said \"wait\"; he went ashore and picked up a long  pole with a bushy tip; it had evidently been used before. Dropping down  to the spring-hole, he thrust the tip to the bottom and slashed it  around in a way to scare and scatter every trout within a hundred feet.    \"And what does all that mean?\" I asked.    \"Well,\" he said, \"every trout will be back in less than an hour; and  when they first come back, they take the bait greedily. Better take off  your leader and try bait.\"    Which I did. "]]]
