The semi-arboreal nature of _P. truei_ may explain why individuals  of this species do not have larger ranges than individuals of _P.  maniculatus_. _P. truei_ has a three-dimensional home range, whereas _P.  maniculatus_ has a range that is two-dimensional only (excluding the  relatively minor amount of burrowing done by each species).          VEGETATIONAL ANALYSIS OF HABITATS      Detailed maps of vegetation within the trapping grid were needed to aid  in analyzing distribution of mice within the grid. In preparing such  maps, I recorded all plants within a 25 foot radius of each trapping  station. The dominant and codominant plants in the overstory (trees or  shrubs) were noted at each station. Next the three most abundant plants  other than the dominant and codominants were rated for each station,  where possible. Finally a listing was made of all remaining species of  plants.    On the basis of this analysis, four vegetational maps were prepared. One  shows associations of dominant overstory and understory plants.  Individual maps are devoted to the first, second and third most abundant  plants in the ground cover within the trapping grid (Figs. 5-8).  Approximately seven man-hours were required to analyze each trapping  unit, and 112 man-hours to analyze the entire grid.    The home range grid encompasses approximately one million square feet.  At least four different vegetational stands occur within the grid: 1)  pinyon-juniper woodland with various associations in the understory; 2)  _Artemisia tridentata_ (big sagebrush), or _A. nova_ (black sagebrush);  3) _Quercus gambelii_ (Gambel oak); and 4) mixed shrubs--_Fendlera  rupicola_ (fendlerbush), _Amelanchier utahensis_ (Utah serviceberry),  and _Cercocarpos montanus_ (mountain mahogany).    Flora in the ground cover is regulated, at least in part, by the canopy  cover; hence different associations of pinyon-juniper woodland and each  of the stands mentioned above have different plants, or a different  distribution of the same kinds of plants, in their ground cover.    Units A, B, E, and parts of D and G in the western third of the grid are  in pinyon-juniper woodland (Fig. 5). A relatively pure understory of  _Poa fendleriana_ (muttongrass), is typical of such woodland on the  middle parts of the mesas. Woodland on the western third of the grid  differs somewhat in that, when the area occupied by each plant is  considered, _Artemisia tridentata_ is codominant there with _Poa  fendleriana_. As far as individual plants are concerned, _Poa_ far  outnumbers _Artemisia_. The next most abundant plants in the ground  cover are _Solidago petradoria_ (rock goldenrod), _Chrysothamnus  depressus_ (dwarf rabbitbrush), and _Penstemon linarioides_ (penstemon),  in that order.    In unit E there is a large depression, about 200 by 60 feet, created by  removal of soil (Fig. 8). _Artemisia nova_ grows there, and pioneering  plants adapted to early stages of succession are present.    A zone of woodland, where _Artemisia nova_ replaces _A. tridentata_ as  an understory codominant with _Poa fendleriana_, borders the  pinyon-juniper-muttongrass community to the east. The next most abundant  plants in the ground cover are _Solidago petradoria_, _Penstemon  linarioides_ and _Comandra umbellata_ (bastard toadflax). _Koeleria  cristata_ (Junegrass) is as abundant as _Comandra_, but probably is less  important as a source of food for mice.    A small strip of the pinyon-juniper-muttongrass community with an  understory of _Artemisia nova_ and _Purshia tridentata_ (bitterbrush)  adjoins the above area to the east (Figs. 5-8). _Solidago petradoria_,  _Balsamorrhiza sagittata_ (balsamroot), and _Comandra umbellata_ are the  three most abundant plants in the ground cover. The terrain slopes  eastward from this zone into a large drainage.        [Illustration: FIG. 5: Diagram showing the major associations of         understory and overstory vegetation in a trapping grid located         south of Far View Ruins, Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado.]    As the forest floor begins to slope into the drainage, the ground  becomes rocky and shrubs assume more importance in the understory. Most  of this shrubby zone is on the slope; on the western side this zone  abuts pinyon-juniper woodland, and on the eastern side is bordered by  _Artemisia tridentata_ in the sandy bottom of the drainage. Shrubs  become more abundant and pinyon and juniper trees become less abundant  as one approaches the drainage. In the vegetation maps, this brushy zone  is delimited on the east by a heavy line passing vertically through the  middle of the grid (Figs. 5-8). The codominant shrubs in the understory  of this zone are _Amelanchier utahensis_, _Artemisia nova_ and _Purshia  tridentata_. The three most abundant plants on the ground are _Artemisia  ludoviciana_, _Chrysothamnus depressus_ and _Penstemon linarioides_.    The drainage occupies most of unit N and parts of Units I, J and M. Unit  N is at the head of the drainage; the ground slopes rapidly southward  and the bottom of the drainage in unit J is approximately 50 feet lower  than in unit N. The canopy cover of the drainage is _Artemisia  tridentata_ (Fig. 5). The same three plants that are most abundant in  the ground cover of the slope are also most abundant in the drainage.        [Illustration: FIG. 6: Diagram showing the most abundant species of         plants in the ground cover of the trapping grid south of Far View         Ruins.]    The eastern slope of the drainage is covered with oak chaparral  (_Quercus gambelii_); this zone occupies parts of units J, L, M, and P.  _Artemisia ludoviciana_, _Solidago petradoria_, and _Viguiera  multiflora_ (goldeneye), are the most abundant plants of the ground  cover.    Mixed shrubs (_Amelanchier_, _Cercocarpos_, and _Fendlera_) form large  islands in the oak chaparral, in units K, L and P. The brushy areas of  oak and mixed shrub give way at the top of the slope to pinyon-juniper  forest with an understory of _Artemisia nova_ and _Purshia tridentata_.  The three most abundant plants in the ground cover of the shrub zones  are _Solidago petradoria_, _Balsamorrhiza sagittata_, and _Comandra  umbellata_. The eastern part of unit O has _Amelanchier utahensis_ in  the understory, in addition to _Artemisia nova_ and _Purshia tridentata_  (Fig. 5). The northeastern corner of unit O is in pinyon-juniper  woodland with an understory of _Cercocarpos montanus_.        [Illustration: FIG. 7: Diagram showing the second most abundant         species of plants in the ground cover of the trapping grid south         of Far View Ruins.]    There are two relatively pure stands of sagebrush in the grid: one is in  unit N, and the other in unit F and part of unit G. As figures 5 to 8  show, unit N has a relatively pure stand of _Artemisia tridentata_ (big  sagebrush), with _Artemisia ludoviciana_, _Agropyron smithii_ (western  wheatgrass), and _Koeleria cristata_ (Junegrass), being most abundant in  the ground cover. _Artemisia tridentata_ and _Artemisia nova_ form the  overstory in unit F and part of G. The three most abundant plants in the  ground cover there are _Chrysothamnus depressus_, _Solidago petradoria_,  and _Penstemon linarioides_ (Figs. 6-8).        [Illustration: FIG. 8: Diagram showing the third most abundant         species of plants in the ground cover of the trapping grid south         of Far View Ruins.]          MICROCLIMATES OF DIFFERENT HABITATS      Four microclimatic stations were established in units D, F, L and M of  the trapping grid to record air temperatures and relative humidities at  ground level. These sites were chosen as being representative of larger  topographic or vegetational areas within the grid. Belfort  hygrothermographs were installed on June 10, 1964, and were serviced  once each week through October 31, 1964, at which time the stations were  dismantled. Each station consisted of a shelter 18 by 9 by 11.5 inches,  having a false top to minimize heating (Fig. 9). The shelters were  painted white. Several rows of holes, each one inch in diameter, were  drilled in all four sides of each shelter, to provide circulation of  air. The holes were covered by brass window screening to prevent entry  of insects and rodents. Preliminary tests with several U. S. Weather  Bureau maximum and minimum thermometers, suspended one above the other,  from the top to the bottom of the shelter, revealed that there was no  stratification of air within the shelters. Nevertheless, each shelter  was placed so that the sun did not strike the sensing elements of the  hygrothermograph inside it.        [Illustration: FIG. 9: (above) Photograph of microclimatic shelter         built to house hygrothermograph. False top minimizes heating, and         ventilation holes are covered with screening. (below) Photograph         showing shelter in use.]    Accuracy of the hair elements was checked by means of a Bendix-Friez  battery driven psychrometer, in periods when humidity conditions were  stable (on clear days the relative humidity is at its lowest limits and  is \"stable\" for several hours during early afternoon).    The four microclimatic stations were in the following places: 1) a stand  of big sagebrush near Far View Ruins; 2) a pinyon-juniper-muttongrass  association; 3) a stand of big sagebrush at the head of a drainage; and  4) a stand of Gambel oak on a southwest-facing slope of the drainage.  Table 4 shows monthly averages of maximum and minimum air temperatures  and relative humidities at each of the four sites. Vegetation and  microclimates of the sites are discussed below.      _Far View Sagebrush Site, 7,650 feet elevation_    The shelter housing the hygrothermograph was next to the stake of  station F4a in the trapping grid (Fig. 10), in a stand "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38961"],[0,"Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's ships Adventure and Beagle, (#8)"],[1,"violent jerks received in Possession Bay had done it  much damage. While veering cable, the support at one end gave way, and the  axle of the barrel was forced out of the socket, by which some of the pawls  were injured. Fortunately, dangerous consequences were prevented, and a  temporary repair was soon applied.    The Beagle, by her better sailing, had reached a more advanced situation,  close to the N.E. end of Elizabeth Island, but had anchored  disadvantageously in deep water, and in the strength of the tide. Next  morning we made an attempt to pass round Elizabeth Island, but found the  breeze so strong that we were forced to return, and were fortunate enough  to find good anchorage northward of the island, out of the tide.    The Patagonians, during the day, showed much uneasiness at being kept on  board so much longer than they expected; but as they seemed to understand  the cause of their detention, and as their sickness ceased when we reached  smooth water, they gradually recovered their good-humour, and became very  communicative. As well as we could understand their pronunciation, their  names were 'Coigh,' 'Coichi,' and 'Aighen.' The country behind Cape Negro  they called 'Chilpeyo;' the land of Tierra del Fuego, 'Osch[=e]rri;'  Elizabeth Island, 'T[)u]rr[)e]tterr;' the island of Santa Magdalena,  'Shr[=e]e-ket-tup;' and Cape Negro, 'O[=e]rkr[)e]ckur.' The Indians of  Tierra del Fuego, with whom they are not on friendly terms, are designated  by them 'S[)a]p[=a]ll[)i][)o]s.' This name was applied to them in a  contemptuous tone.    Aighen's features were remarkably different from those of his companions.  Instead of a flat nose, his was aquiline and prominent, and his countenance  was full of expression. He proved to be good-tempered, and easily pleased;  and whenever a shade of melancholy began to appear, our assurance of {21}  landing him on the morrow restored his good-humour, which was shown by  singing and laughing.    The dimensions of Coichi's head were as follows:--      From the top of the fore part of the head to the eyes  4 inches.      Do                 do       to the tip of the nose   6      Do                 do       to the mouth             7      Do                 do       to the chin              9    Width of the head across the temples                   7-1/2    Breadth of the shoulders                              18-1/2    The head was long and flat, at the top; the forehead broad and high, but  covered with hair to within an inch and a half of the eyebrow, which had  scarcely any hair. The eyes were small, the nose was short, the mouth wide,  and the lips thick. Neck short, and shoulders very broad. The arms were  short, and wanting in muscle, as were also the thighs and legs. The body  was long and large, and the breast broad and expanded. His height was  nearly six feet.    The next day we rounded Elizabeth Island, and reached Cape Negro, where we  landed the Indians, after making them several useful presents, and sending  some trifles by Aighen to Maria, who, with her tribe, had lighted large  fires about the country behind Peckett's Harbour, to invite us to land. Our  passengers frequently pointed to them, telling us that they were made by  Maria, who had brought plenty of guanaco meat for us.    Our anxiety to reach Port Famine prevented delay, and, as soon as the boat  returned, we proceeded along the coast towards Freshwater Bay, which we  reached early enough in the afternoon to admit of a short visit to the  shore.    From Cape Negro the country assumed a very different character. Instead of  a low coast and open treeless shore, we saw steep hills, covered with lofty  trees, and thick underwood. The distant mountains of Tierra del Fuego,  covered with snow, were visible to the southward, some at a distance of  sixty or seventy miles.    We had now passed all the difficulties of the entrance, and had reached a  quiet and secure anchorage.    {22}    The following day was calm, and so warm, that we thought if Wallis and  Cordova were correct in describing the weather they met with, Duclos Guyot  was equally entitled to credit; and we began to hope we had anticipated  worse weather than we should experience. But this was an unusually fine  day, and many weeks elapsed, afterwards, without its equal. The temperature  of the air, in the shade on the beach, was 67-1/2deg, on the sand  87-1/2deg; and that of the water 55deg. Other observations were made, as  well as a plan of the bay, of which there is a description in the Sailing  Directions.    Here we first noticed the character of the vegetation in the Strait, as so  different from that of Cape Gregory and other parts of the Patagonian  coast, which is mainly attributable to the change of soil; the northern  part being a very poor clay, whilst here a schistose sub-soil is covered by  a mixture of alluvium, deposited by mountain streams; and decomposed  vegetable matter, which, from the thickness of the forests, is in great  quantity.    Two specimens of beech (_Fagus betuloides_ and _antarctica_), the former an  evergreen,--and the winter's bark (_Wintera aromatica_), are the only trees  of large size that we found here; but the underwood is very thick, and  composed of a great variety of plants, of which _Arbutus rigida_, two or  three species of _Berberis_, and a wild currant (_Ribes antarctica_, Bankes  and Solander MSS.), at this time in flower, and forming long clustering  bunches of young fruit, were the most remarkable. The berberis produces a  berry of acidulous taste, that promised to be useful to us. A species of  wild celery, also, which grows abundantly near the sea-shore, was valuable  as an antiscorbutic. The trees in the immediate vicinity of the shore are  small, but the beach was strewed with trunks of large trees, which seemed  to have been drifted there by gales and high tides. A river falls into the  bay, by a very narrow channel, near its south end; but it is small, and so  blocked up by trees as not to be navigable even for the smallest boat:  indeed, it is merely a mountain torrent, varying in size according to the  state of the weather.    {23}    Tracks of foxes were numerous about the beach, and the footsteps of a large  quadruped, probably a puma, were observed. Some teal and wild ducks were  shot; and several geese were seen, but, being very wary, they escaped.    Upon Point St. Mary we noticed, for the first time, three or four huts or  wigwams made by the Fuegian Indians, which had been deserted. They were not  old, and merely required a slight covering of branches or skins to make  them habitable. These wigwams are thus constructed: long slender branches,  pointed at the end, are stuck into the ground in a circular or oval figure;  their extremities are bent over, so as to form a rounded roof, and secured  with ligatures of rush; leaving two apertures, one towards the sea, and the  other towards the woods. The fire is made in the middle, and half fills the  hut with smoke. There were no Indians in the bay when we arrived, but, on  the following evening, Lieutenant Sholl, in walking towards the south end  of the bay, suddenly found himself close to a party which had just arrived  in two canoes from the southward. Approaching them, he found there were  nine individuals--three men, and the remainder women and children. One of  the women was very old, and so infirm as to require to be lifted out of the  canoe and carried to the fire. They seemed to have no weapons of any  consequence; but, from our subsequent knowledge of their habits, and  disposition, the probability is they had spears, bows, and arrows concealed  close at hand. The only implement found amongst them was a sort of hatchet  or knife, made of a crooked piece of wood, with part of an iron hoop tied  to the end. The men were very slightly clothed, having only the back  protected by a seal's skin; but the females wore large guanaco mantles,  like those of the Patagonian Indians, whom our pilot told us they  occasionally met for the purpose of barter. Some of the party were  devouring seal's flesh, and drinking the oil extracted from its blubber,  which they carried in bladders. The meat they were eating was probably part  of a sea lion (_Phoca jubata_); for Mr. Sholl found amongst them a portion  of the neck of one of those animals, which is {24} remarkable for the long  hair, \"like a lion's mane,\" growing upon it. They appeared to be a most  miserable, squalid race, very inferior, in every respect, to the  Patagonians. They did not evince the least uneasiness at Mr. Sholl's  presence, or at our ships being close to them; neither did they interfere  with him, but remained squatting round their fire while he staid near. This  seeming indifference, and total want of curiosity, gave us no favourable  opinion of their character as intellectual beings; indeed, they appeared to  be very little removed from brutes; but our subsequent knowledge of them  has convinced us that they are not usually deficient in intellect. This  party was perhaps stupified by the unusual size of our ships, for the  vessels which frequent this Strait are seldom one hundred tons in burthen.    We proceeded next morning at an early hour. The Indians were already  paddling across the bay in a northerly direction. Upon coming abreast of  them, a thick smoke was perceived to rise suddenly from their canoes; they  had probably fed the fire, which they always carry in the middle of their  canoe, with green boughs and leaves, for the purpose of attracting our  attention, and inviting us to communicate with them.    It was remarked that the country begins to be covered with trees at Cape  Negro; but they are stunted, compared with those at Freshwater Bay. Near  this place, also, the country assumes a more verdant aspect, becoming also  higher, and more varied in appearance. In the neighbourhood of Rocky Point  some conspicuous portions of land were noticed,"]]]
