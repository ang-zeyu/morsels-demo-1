They preached baptism for the remission of sins, promised the gift of  the Holy Ghost, and believed in the literal fulfillment of prophesy.  They also had some of the apostolic forms of organization in their  church.    In Ohio they raised up branches. In Kirtland and the regions round,  they made many disciples, who bore the style of \"disciples,\" though  the popular sect-name was \"Campbellites.\" Among them were Eliza R.  Snow, Elizabeth Ann Whitney, and many more, who afterwards embraced the  \"fullness of the everlasting gospel\" as restored by the angels to the  Mormon prophet.    But these evangels of a John the Baptist mission brought not to the  West the light of new revelation in their lamp.    These had not yet even heard of the opening of a new dispensation of  revelations. As they came by the way they had seen no angels with new  commissions for the Messiah age. No Moses nor Elijah had been with them  on a mount of transfiguration. Nor had they entered into the chamber  with the angel of the covenant, bringing a renewal of the covenant to  Israel. This was in the mission of the \"one greater\" than they who came  after.    They brought the lamp without the light--nothing more. Better _the  light_ without the evangelical lamp--better a conscientious intellect  than the forms of sectarian godliness without the power.    Without the power to unlock the heavens, and the Elijah faith to call  the angels down, there could be no new dispensation--no millennial  civilization for the world, to crown the civilization of the ages.    Light came to Sidney Rigdon from the Mormon Elijah, and he comprehended  the light; but Alexander Campbell rejected the prophet when his message  came; he would have none of his angels. He had been preaching the  literal fulfillment of prophesy, but when the covenant was revealed he  was not ready. The lamp, not the light, was his admiration. Himself  was the lamp; _Joseph had the light from the spirit world_, and the  darkness comprehended it not.    Alexander Campbell was a learned and an able man--the very _form of  wisdom_, but without the spirit.    Joseph Smith was an unlettered youth. He came not in the polished  _form_ of wisdom--either divine or human--but in the demonstration of  the Holy Ghost, and with signs following the believer.    Mr. Campbell would receive no new revelation from such an one--no  everlasting covenant from the new Jerusalem which was waiting to come  down, to establish on earth a great spiritual empire, that the King  might appear to Zion in his glory, with all his angels and the ancients  of days.    The tattered and blood-stained commissions of old Rome were sufficient  for the polished divine,--Rome which had made all nations drunk with  her spiritual fornications,--Rome which put to death the Son of God  when his Israel in blindness rejected him.    Between Rome and Jerusalem there was now the great controversy of the  God of Israel. Not the old Jerusalem which had traveled from the east  to the west, led by the angel of the covenant, up out of the land of  Egypt! The new Jerusalem to the earth then, as she is to-day! Ever will  she be the new Jerusalem--ever will \"old things\" be passing away when  \"the Lord cometh!\"    And the angel of the west appeared by night to the youth, as he watched  in the chamber of his father's house, in a little village in the State  of New York. On that charmed night when the invisibles hovered about  the earth the angel that stood before him read to the messenger of  Messiah the mystic text of his mission:    \"_Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before  me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even  the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in; behold he shall  come, saith the Lord of Hosts._\"        CHAPTER VI.    AN ANGEL FROM THE CLOUD IS HEARD IN KIRTLAND--THE \"DAUGHTER OF THE  VOICE.\"    Now there dwelt in Kirtland in those days disciples who feared the Lord.    And they \"spake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened and heard  it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that  feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.\"    \"We had been praying,\" says mother Whitney, \"to know from the Lord how  we could obtain the gift of the Holy Ghost.\"    \"My husband, Newel K. Whitney, and myself, were Campbellites. We had  been baptized for the remission of our sins, and believed in the laying  on of hands and the gifts of the spirit. But there was no one with  authority to confer the Holy Ghost upon us. We were seeking to know how  to obtain the spirit and the gifts bestowed upon the ancient saints.    \"Sister Eliza Snow was also a Campbellite. We were acquainted before  the restoration of the gospel to the earth. She, like myself, was  seeking for the fullness of the gospel. She lived at the time in Mantua.    \"One night--it was midnight--as my husband and I, in our house at  Kirtland, were praying to the father to be shown the way, the spirit  rested upon us and a _cloud_ overshadowed the house.    \"It was as though we were out of doors. The house passed away from  our vision. We were not conscious of anything but the presence of the  spirit and the cloud that was over us.    \"We were wrapped in the cloud. A solemn awe pervaded us. We saw the  cloud and we felt the spirit of the Lord.    \"Then we heard a voice out of the cloud saying:    \"'Prepare to receive the word of the Lord, for it is coming!'    \"At this we marveled greatly; but from that moment we knew that the  word of the Lord was coming to Kirtland.\"    Now this is an Hebraic sign, well known to Israel after the glory of  Israel had departed. It was called by the sacred people who inherited  the covenant \"the daughter of the voice.\"    Blindness had happened to Israel. The prophets and the seers the Lord  had covered, but the \"daughter of the voice\" was still left to Israel.  From time to time a few, with the magic blood of the prophets in them,  heard the voice speaking to them out of the cloud.    Down through the ages the \"daughter of the voice\" followed the children  of Israel in their dispersions. Down through the ages, from time to  time, some of the children of the sacred seed have heard the voice.  This is the tradition of the sons and daughters of Judah.    It was the \"daughter of the voice\" that Mother Whitney and her husband  heard, at midnight, in Kirtland, speaking to them out of the cloud.  Mother Whitney and her husband were of the seed of Israel (so run their  patriarchal blessings); it was their gift and privilege to hear the  \"voice.\"    _He_ was coming now, whose right it is to reign. The throne of David  was about to be re-set up and given to the lion of the tribe of Judah.  The everlasting King of the new Jerusalem was coming down, with the  tens of thousands of his saints.    The star of Messiah was traveling from the east to the west. The  prophet--the messenger of Messiah's covenant--was about to remove  farther westward, towards the place where his Lord in due time will  commence his reign, which shall extend over all the earth.    This was the meaning of that vision of the \"cloud\" in Kirtland, at  midnight, overshadowing the house of Newel K. Whitney; this the  significance of the \"voice\" which spoke out of the cloud, saying:  \"Prepare to receive the word of the Lord, for it is coming!\"    The Lord of Hosts was about to make up his jewels for the crown of his  appearing; and there were many of those jewels already in the West.        CHAPTER VII.    AN ISRAEL PREPARED BY VISIONS, DREAMS AND ANGELS--INTERESTING AND  MIRACULOUS STORY OF PARLEY P. PRATT--A MYSTIC SIGN OF MESSIAH IN THE  HEAVENS--THE ANGEL'S WORDS FULFILLED.    The divine narrative leads directly into the personal story of Parley  P. Pratt. He it was who first brought the Mormon mission west. He it  was who presented the Book of Mormon to Sidney Rigdon, and converted  him to the new covenant which Jehovah was making with a latter-day  Israel.    Parley P. Pratt was one of the earliest of the new apostles. By nature  he was both poet and prophet. The soul of prophesy was born in him. In  his lifetime he was the Mormon Isaiah. All his writings were Hebraic.  He may have been of Jewish blood. He certainly possessed the Jewish  genius, of the prophet order.    It would seem that the spirit of this great latter-day work could not  throw its divine charms around the youthful prophet, who had been  raised up to open a crowning spiritual dispensation, without peculiarly  affecting the spiritual minded everywhere--both men and women.    It is one of the remarkable facts connected with the rise of Mormonism  in the age that, at about the time Joseph Smith was receiving the  administration of angels, thousands both in America and Great Britain  were favored with corresponding visions and intuitions. Hence, indeed,  its success, which was quite as astonishing as the spiritual work of  the early Christians.    One of the first manifestations was that of earnest gospel-seekers  having visions of the elders before they came, and recognizing them  when they did come bearing the tidings. Many of the sisters, as well as  the brethren, can bear witness of this.    This very peculiar experience gave special significance to one of the  earliest hymns, sung by the saints, of the angel who \"came down from  the mansions of glory\" with \"the fullness of Jesus's gospel,\" and also  the \"covenant to gather his people,\" the refrain of which was,      \"O! Israel! O! Israel! in all your abidings,    Prepare for your Lord, when you hear these glad tidings.\"    An Israel had been prepared in all their \"abidings,\" by visions and  signs, like sister Whitney, who heard the voice of the angel, from the  cloud, bidding her prepare for the coming word of the Lord. Parley P.  Pratt was the elder who fulfilled her vision, and brought the word of  the Lord direct from Joseph to Kirtland.    And Parley"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],[0,"Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#8)"],[1,"him hid three months, after which  she put him in an ark of bulrushes, while his sister acted as a spy and  watched over him at a distance. King Pharoah's daughter to her bath  drew near; the babe's cries inclined her heart to the young Hebrew,  the spy was at hand, the real mother was procured, who received pay  for minding her own child. Moses finally became the adopted son of the  king's daughter, whom she named Moses, because she drew him out of the  water, as found in the 2nd chapter of Exodus. The life and history of  Moses is well known to every Bible student, as the deliverer of ancient  Israel, and I ask, is it more marvelous to accept a modern Moses in the  person of Joseph Smith, the Prophet whom God raised up in our day?    Again, if the selection by Jesus of Peter the fisherman to be the chief  apostle had taken place in our day, it would probably have seemed as  surprising as the choosing of Joseph Smith for his work. The fellow  apostles of Peter were all unlearned, except Paul.    It is just as easy for our Lord to accomplish His purposes now through  the agency of unlearned men as it was anciently. God _has_ established  a Church through the agency of this young man, which has caused the  wisdom of the wise to perish.    The story of Joseph Smith's first vision is a very simple and beautiful  one. It will be remembered he was but a boy fourteen years of age when  this event occurred. He had been, previously, in a disturbed state of  mind concerning religion. In the neighborhood where he dwelt there  had been great excitement, on account of a religious revival. At the  meetings he attended he learned that the various sects were very much  opposed to each other. In the midst of this tumult and war of words and  opinions, Joseph felt grieved and asked himself, \"What is to be done?  Who of all these are right? And how shall I know?\"    One day Joseph read in the first chapter of James as follows:     \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men   liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"    Using Joseph's own words, he said:     \"Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart   of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with   great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again   and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did.   * * * Unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never   know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood   the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all   confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible. At   length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness   and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of   God. * * * So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of   God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning   of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred   and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such   an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the   attempt to pray vocally. After I had retired to the place where I had   previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself   alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart   to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by   some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing   influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak.   Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as   if I were doomed to sudden destruction. But exerting all my powers to   call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had   seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into   despair and abandon myself to destruction--not to an imaginary ruin,   but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had   such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being--just at   this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my   head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until   it fell upon me. It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered   from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I   saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description,   standing above me in the air. One of them spoke unto me, calling me by   name and said, pointing to the other, 'This is my beloved Son, hear   him!'     \"My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all   the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner,   therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak,   than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which   of all the sects was right--for at this time it had never entered   into my heart that all were wrong--and which I should join. I was   answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong;   and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were   an abomination in his sight. * * 'They teach for doctrine the   commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the   power thereof.' He again forbade me to join any of them; and many   other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time.     \"Some time afterwards the vision was made known to a Methodist   preacher, who treated it with contempt, saying it was all from the   devil; that there was no such thing as visions or revelations in these   days; that all such things had ceased with the Apostles, and that   there never would be any more of them.\"    The ministers and others persecuted him, which caused him deep sorrow,  although an obscure boy, and under the necessity of obtaining a scanty  maintenance by his daily labor. But, strange to say, he became very  prominent and conspicuous, and evil was spoken of him continually.  Nevertheless, he had seen a vision, and, like Paul before King Agrippa,  related the account of the vision he had, when he \"saw a light and  heard a voice.\" Still, there were a few who believed him. Some said  he was dishonest; others said he was mad; and he (like Joseph) was  ridiculed and reviled; but all this did not destroy the reality of his  vision. He had seen a vision--he knew he had--and all the persecution  under heaven could not make it otherwise. Joseph Smith said:     \"I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God?   or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen?   for I had seen a vision. I knew it. I knew that God knew it; and I   could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so   doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.\"    For over three years Joseph continued his labors daily until the 21st  of September, 1823. After retiring to his bed in quite a serious mood,  he shortly betook himself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God  for a manifestation of his standing before Him. While thus engaged he  received the following vision, using his own words:     \"While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light   appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was   lighter than at noonday, when a personage appeared at my bed-side;   he had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness, * * * his hands   were naked, and his arms also a little above the wrist, * * * his head   and neck were also bare. * * * his whole person was glorious beyond   description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room was   exceedingly light, but no so very bright as immediately around his   person. When I first looked upon him I was afraid, but the fear soon   left me.     \"He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent   from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that   God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good   and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues; or that it should   be both good and evil spoken of among all people. * * * While he   was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was opened to   my mind that I could see the place where the plates were deposited,   and that so clearly and distinctly, that I knew the place again when   I visited it. After this communication, I saw the light in the room   begin to gather immediately around the person of him who had been   speaking to me, and it continued to do so until the room was again   left dark, except just around him, when instantly I saw, as it were, a   conduit open right up into heaven, and he ascended up till he entirely   disappeared, and the room was left as it had been before this heavenly   light had made its appearance.\"    This vision was repeated three times during the night, and the  angel each time instructed him of great events, such as famine,  war, pestilence and grievous judgments, which were to come in this  generation. He also reminded him that his name should be known for good  and evil, and that wicked men would seek to destroy him, which was  literally fulfilled.    In 1517, Mexico, then unknown to the world, though teeming with its  millions of Lamanites, was discovered by Cortez; and the gold plates  that Joseph Smith received contain their history, which I advise all  men to read.    Furthermore, the angel said that the fulness of the everlasting  gospel was contained in the record that was about to be delivered to  him, which was the same as that taught by the Savior to the ancient  inhabitants of Jerusalem.    Thus comes unto us knowledge unveiling the mystery surrounding the  American Indians which has puzzled the most profound historians of our  age to explain. For all this useful knowledge we are indebted to God,  the giver of all good.    Although the Prophet was manifestly unlearned at this time, as evinced  by the"]]]
