[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33659"],[0,"Mammals of Northwestern South Dakota (#8)"],[1,"the 10 mammals in this faunal group, three  (_Eutamias minimus_, _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus_, and _Microtus  pennsylvanicus_) are distributed both in the boreal forests to the north  of the plains and in montane areas to the west. Six species (_Myotis  evotis_, _Myotis volans_, _Plecotus townsendii_, _Thomomys talpoides_,  _Neotoma cinerea_, and _Ovis canadensis_) are primarily montane in  distribution and evidently reached northwestern South Dakota from the  west in late Wisconsin or post-glacial times; all but the pocket gopher  occur there now only in the vicinity of coniferous timber or rocky  buttes. The remaining species, _Zapus hudsonius_, is a glacial \"relic.\"  The nearest populations now are far to the north, and this jumping mouse  occupies only restricted habitats in northwestern South Dakota and  adjacent regions. In Harding County, _Z. hudsonius_ presently is known  only from Deer Draw in the Slim Buttes.    _Steppe species._--Taxa intimately associated with the Great Plains are:  _Lepus townsendii_, _Cynomys ludovicianus_, _Spermophilus  tridecemlineatus_, _Perognathus fasciatus_, _Perognathus hispidus_,  _Reithrodontomys montanus_, _Microtus ochrogaster_, _Mustela nigripes_,  and _Spilogale putorius_ (subspecies _interrupta_). A few of these are  endemic to the plains, but most occur in grassland habitats beyond the  borders of the region. All clearly are well adapted to, and therefore  presumably evolved in response to, the environment of the interior  grasslands; this zoogeographic unit, then, is characterized by truly  steppe species that have relatively narrow habitat requirements and  largely concordant patterns of distribution.    The case of the spotted skunk deserves brief commentary. This species  was not taken or observed by members of our field parties and local  residents made no claim to its presence except for a few vague  recollections of spotted skunks having been seen \"years ago.\" Visher  (1914:91), however, reported that _Spilogale_ was much commoner than  _Mephitis_ in the early part of the century. However that may have been,  _Spilogale putorius_, as currently understood, would be judged to be a  widespread species except that recent evidence strongly suggests that  the plains race (_interrupta_) is not of the same species as spotted  skunks to the west (subspecies _gracilis_). Furthermore, the ranges of  the two are not in contact. Whatever its ultimate specific affinities  may be, _S. p. interrupta_ clearly is a plains mammal, and thus is here  considered in that zoogeographic unit.    _Sonoran species._--_Sylvilagus audubonii_, _Dipodomys ordii_,  _Reithrodontomys megalotis_, and _Onychomys leucogaster_ are invaders to  the Northern Great Plains from the Sonoran region to the southwest. The  latter two, however, are rather broadly distributed on the Great Plains  and their assignment as Sonoran species is somewhat arbitrary. It is of  interest that as many as nine mammals with southwestern affinities occur  as far north as southwestern South Dakota and adjacent Wyoming.    _Eastern species._--Only _Sylvilagus floridanus_ and _Peromyscus  leucopus_ can be identified as species primarily associated with the  eastern deciduous forest. The former is limited in northwestern South  Dakota to brushy habitats in riparian communities, whereas _P. leucopus_  is restricted to relatively good stands of deciduous timber and  presently is known to occur only in Deer Draw of the Slim Buttes.    Throughout its known range in the western part of the Northern Great  Plains, _P. leucopus_ is represented by small and disjunct populations  associated with riparian deciduous timber. The known population nearest  to Harding County is on the Black Hills to the south; next nearest are  several isolated or semi-isolated populations along the Yellowstone  River in eastern Montana. Presumably, this white-footed mouse spread  northwestward into the western part of the plains region along river  systems, in company with deciduous trees, in some post-glacial period  when the climate was warmer and wetter than now. Subsequent drying  altered substantially the distribution and perhaps composition of  riparian forests, and isolated populations of _P. leucopus_ evidently  survived only in restricted areas, such as Deer Draw, many of them  probably marginal habitat for the species.    _Unverified species._--If the 10 species listed as of \"unverified  occurrence,\" it seems highly likely that as many as eight will be found  to occur, or occurred within historic time, in Harding County. Among  these eight are one steppe species (_Vulpes velox_), three with  boreomontane affinities (_Sorex cinereus_, _Gulo gulo_, and _Lynx  canadensis_), two (_Sciurus niger_ and _Urocyon cinereoargenteus_) that  are associated with the eastern deciduous forests, and two (_Sorex  merriami_ and _Lagurus curtatus_) that are Great Basin elements.    It is noteworthy that the last-mentioned faunal unit is not known to be  represented in northwestern South Dakota.      ACKNOWLEDGMENTS    For assistance in the field, we are especially grateful to the students  who were enrolled in the Field Course in Vertebrate Zoology at The  University of Kansas in the summers of 1961, 1965, and 1970, and to M.  A. Levy, R. R. Patterson, and T. H. Swearingen. In 1965 and 1970, the  summer field course was supported in part by grants (GE-7739 and  GZ-1512, respectively) from the National Science Foundation; Andersen  was supported in the field in 1968 by a grant from the Kansas City  Council for Higher Education. Personnel of the U.S. Forest Service  (Sioux Division, Custer National Forest), particularly District Ranger  Timothy S. Burns, were most helpful to us in the field, as were Wardens  Wesley Broer and Merritt Paukarbek of the South Dakota Department of  Game, Fish and Parks. Robert Kriege, Federal predator control agent  stationed in Buffalo, was most generous in sharing with us his knowledge  of rodents and carnivores in the area, and many present or former  residents, particularly Carl Cornell and Spike Jorgensen, also provided  useful information and were helpful in other ways.    Ectoparasites reported here were identified by Cluff E. Hopla (fleas),  Richard B. Loomis (chiggers), and Glen M. Kohls (ticks). Other than  mammals housed in the Museum of Natural History, we examined only three,  two in the U.S. National Museum (USNM) and one in the collection at  South Dakota State University, Brookings (SDSU).

I credit this entirely to its youth.\"    \"Indeed! Its railroad facilities--?\"    \"The C. H. & S. F. is its great trunk line. Three branch lines have  their centre there--just built. Two roads are surveyed to shorten the  distance to Chicago and San Francisco respectively.\"    \"Any other facts of interest, Mr. Ticks?\" Mr. Ticks hesitated.    \"Well--no--yes--no. In fact, there is nothing of special importance that  I--that is different from any other city--except--nothing, sir, that I  am willing to stake my professional reputation upon; you must excuse me,  sir.\"    \"Is it in the cyclone area, Mr. Ticks?\"    \"No, sir. The centre of barometric depression is farther north. The  Buzzard mountains to the south deflect all such storm centres. Russell  will be singularly free from tornadoes.\"    The editor-in-chief looked somewhat nonplussed, and handed Mr. Ticks the  telegram, with the remark:    \"What do you think of that?\"    \"I do not know, sir. I cannot give an opinion.\"    \"I, Mr. Ticks, I for one believe this is true. I'll--I'll stake my  reputation on it!\" said Swift decidedly. Mr. Ticks' exasperating caution  grated on the news editor and converted his scepticism into conviction.    \"If it is,\" replied his chief, quietly, \"you can start for the scene  to-night on the six thirty express. You did up the Charleston  earthquake. You were the first on the spot at Johnstown, and this  promises to be as bad--or as good.\"    Swift tried to look indifferent at this cumulation of trust. He had been  on the paper for five years; he had started in as night reporter, and  his own ability and quickness, united with a certain caution, one might  call it a news integrity, had raised him to his present position. The  _Planet_ had the singular reputation of printing the truth. It rarely  was \"taken in,\" with a false item. It aspired far beyond the local.    The _Planet_, under the able management of its chief and of Swift, had  become the mirror of the world. And, if at times it reflected important  news from a convex surface, it did no more and far less than the  majority of its contemporaries, who had no telegraphic facts to throw  away daily, and who, when hard pressed to it, manufactured a murder at  home or a war rumor abroad to help pad their lean columns.    \"Let me see! It is five forty-five,\" continued the chief, consulting his  watch. \"I will not detain you any longer, Mr. Ticks. We shall want a  column from you on Russell, to-night. And now, Swift,\"--when Mr. Ticks  had faded out of the room,--\"who's this correspondent signed D.?\"    \"It's Dubbs. You know him. Associated press man and special  correspondent. Never failed me. He's the only one there who knows our  cipher.\"    The editor-in-chief did not change his expression, but his eyes had the  steady, stern look that showed easy determination. He quickly wrote a  few words on his pad and handed them to his favorite \"sub.\"    \"Take this to the cashier! Get to the elevated as fast as you can! Buy  what you need when you get time, and--_go!_ I depend on you for the  fullest description to be had. If you do as well as you did on the  Conemaugh, I'll give you a raise on your return. Good luck to you.\"    It did not take Mr. Swift five minutes to rush to his den, slip on his  coat, snatch his hat from the floor, run downstairs, receive a fat roll  of bills from the phlegmatic cashier and bolt for the elevated train. In  twenty-five minutes he was at the central station, with two minutes to  spare. He nodded pleasantly to the gatekeeper and boarded the train as  nonchalantly as if he were going to his suburban boarding-house.          II.      All of our readers will remember the curiosity, the speculation, the  horror, the apprehension, and the sympathy universally excited when, on  the tenth of September, it was learned from the morning papers that  Russell, the new capital of Harrison, was cut off from all  communication. Each morning sheet hinted darkly at the cause of this  unheard-of calamity. The _Daily Braggart_ said there was no doubt that a  cyclone of gigantic proportions, followed by a water-spout, had swept  the city entirely away, and that its evening edition would print full  details of the \"awful visitation,\" with pictures by their special  artists, now on the spot, illustrating the ruin.    Rut there was one piece of additional news about Russell that only the  _Daily Planet_ gave. Let us quote, in order to be perfectly accurate.  The sheet is before us as we write:         \"EXTRAORDINARY CALAMITY!         \"RUSSELL CUT OFF FROM ALL COMMUNICATION!         \"_The citizens of the State of Harrison are wild with       apprehension. As yet we cannot speculate on the nature of this       disaster. Up to this moment no one knows what it is. We will be       honest, and say we know no more than our neighbors. But this       much is assured: Not only is communication cut off within a       radius of twenty miles of the ill-fated city, but it is       impossible to re-establish it at present. There are forces at       work as yet uncatalogued by scientists. There is a definite       circle drawn about Russell, and to cross it means death. Two       men repairing the C. H. & S. F. tracks dropped, smitten by a       mysterious and invisible hand. The white mile post announced       that Russell was twenty miles from the spot where the corpses       of these brave fellows lay. What baneful miasma envelops this       broad area? What is the fate of the thousands within its       borders? Time will tell. Our reporters are on the spot. But as       we go to press we do not know._\"    Most people sniffed at this \"dead line\" as the wildest newspaper canard  of the lot. Many shook their heads. While those who had relatives or  friends or business connections in Russell tried to drown their horrible  suspense as best they could.    The _Planet_, it may be remembered, closed its leading editorial as  follows:         \"_We are a Democratic paper, and we had little love for this       baby State and its upstart capital, created solely to guarantee       a Republican majority at the next presidential election. But       when the news that an inscrutable fate had overtaken this       fraudulent State (we may be pardoned for saying that it seems       to us a sort of Divine retribution for political jobbery) party       feeling was washed away in that common compassion that all       Christians feel for their enemies in adversity._\"    Who could mistake the diction of the uncompromising but tender chief?    But it happened this time, as so often before, that the _Planet's_  information was true. Again that enterprising daily had made its \"scoop\"  on the other papers. Its elation was pardonable.    It is an indisputable fact that civilization as it progresses develops  in its advance new diseases and new catastrophes. Hay fever and la  grippe were not popular a hundred years ago. To breed a first-class  cyclone, cut down your trees and dry up your water supply. This has been  conscientiously attended to, and the natural consequences have  followed. Science can eliminate the simooms that strike Bombay and  Calcutta at such a day year after year, by simply flooding the desert of  Sahara. England can be more easily conquered by deflecting the Gulf  Stream a quarter of a point than by a thousand ironclads. Who knows but  that it would be less expensive to change her into a glacier than to  bombard her with hundred-ton guns?    More white people are killed by railroad accidents yearly in our highly  civilized land than were slaughtered by native braves in the palmy days  of the \"Last of the Mohicans.\" It is a fact that our boasted  civilization, instead of affording surer protection, murders more men in  one way or another than barbarism, only in the present case the victims  are not eaten; the coffins are sumptuous; the processions decorous; the  mourners in good form; the burial service pregnant with hope, and  culture is not shocked. With us murder is committed by corporations, not  by paid assassins. That is the difference. The assassin fails in his  blows once in a while; the corporation never.    But where was Russell? What was the nature of the calamity? The  impenetrable fact that there was an actual, invisible dead line cast  about that territory, with Russell as its centre, became confirmed with  every report. It will be recalled that all the railroad tracks entering  the doomed city were twisted as if clawed by a maddened monster. It  presented a similar appearance to the South Carolina railroad on the day  of the Charleston earthquake. This gave rise again to the earthquake  theory. But why had not the shock been felt? No rumble had been heard.  Could an earthquake account for the deadly something that filled the  air?    No intelligence came from Russell. The way must be forced to it.    Who forgets the relief expeditions started in wagons and on foot from  every point of the compass? These were invariably repelled on reaching  the dead line. We could understand the fetid miasma that made the Great  Dismal Swamp an unknowable country. We could comprehend the encroaching  dead line of the spreading yellow fever bacillus. But this fearful  death, that brooded silently, impenetrably, mysteriously and occultly  over a vast area once the garden of civilization, baffled all attempts  at explanation. Even birds were observed to vacate this tract. Only a  few sinister buzzards wheeled their flight, with straight, unflapping  wings, high above Russell, almost out of sight, as if they were the  embodied ghosts of Russell's unbaptized inhabitants.    What was that implacable power? Reporters and trackmen who steadily  scoffed at it were themselves attacked with violent heart-beats when  they crossed the invisible and fatal line. A convulsion of all the  members followed, as if in an epileptic fit,--insensibility and,  generally, death ensued. Many who were with"]]]
