I see you have one on the wagon.  Use the brake to hold back going downhill.\"    \"'Scuse me, Mistah Swift, 'scuse me!\" exclaimed Eradicate quickly.  \"But yo' doan't know dat brake. It's wuss dan none at all. It doan't  work, fer a fact. No, indeedy, sah. I'se got to rope de wheel.\"    Tom was interested at once. He made an examination of the brake, and  soon saw why it would not hold the wheels. The foot lever was not  properly connected with the brake bar. It was a simple matter to  adjust it by changing a single bolt, and this Tom did with tools he  took from the bag on his motor-cycle. The colored man looked on in  open-mouthed amazement, and even Boomerang peered lazily around, as  if taking an interest in the proceedings.    \"There,\" said Tom at length, as he tightened the nut. \"That brake  will work now, and hold the wagon on any hill. You won't need to  rope the wheel. You didn't have the right leverage on it.\"    \"'Scuse me, Mistah Swift, but what's dat yo' said?\" and Eradicate  leaned forward to listen deferentially.    \"I said you didn't have the right leverage.\"    \"No, sah, Mistah Swift, 'scuse me, but yo' made a slight mistake. I  ain't never had no liverage on dis yeah wagon. It ain't dat kind ob  a wagon. I onct drove a livery rig, but dat were some years ago. I  ain't worked fo' de livery stable in some time now. Dat's why I know  dere ain't no livery on dis wagon. Yo'll 'scuse me, but yo' am  slightly mistaken.\"    \"All right,\" rejoined Tom with a laugh, not thinking it worth while  to explain what he meant by the lever force of the brake rod. \"Let  it go at that. Livery or no livery, your brake will work now. I  guess you're all right. Now don't forget to come around and do some  whitewashing,\" and seeing that the colored man was able to mount to  the seat and start off Boomerang, who seemed to have deep-rooted  objections about moving, Tom wheeled his motor-cycle back to the  road.    Eradicate Sampson drove his wagon a short distance and then suddenly  applied the brake. It stopped short, and the mule looked around as  if surprised.    \"It suah do work, Mistah Swift!\" called the darky to Tom, who was  waiting the result of his little repair job. \"It suah do work!\"    \"I'm glad of it.\"    \"Mah golly! But yo' am suttinly a conjure-man when it comes t'  fixin' wagons! Did yo' eber work fer a blacksmith?\"    \"No, not exactly. Well, good-by, Eradicate. I'll look for you some  day next week.\"    With that Tom leaped on his machine and speeded off ahead of the  colored man and his rig. As he passed the load of fence posts the  youth heard Eradicate remark in awestricken tones:    \"Mah golly! He suttinly go laik de wind! An' t' t'ink dat I were hit  by dat monstrousness machine, an' not hurted! Mah golly! T'ings am  suttinly happenin'! G'lang, Boomerang!\"    \"This machine has more possibilities in it than I suspected,\" mused  Tom. \"But one thing I've got to change, and that is the gasolene and  spark controls. I don't like them the way they are. I want a better  leverage, just as Eradicate needed on his wagon. I'll fix them, too,  when I get home.\"    He rode for several hours, until he thought it was about dinner  time, and then, heading the machine toward home, he put on all the  speed possible, soon arriving where his father was at work in the  shop.    \"Well, how goes it?\" asked Mr. Swift with a smile as he looked at  the flushed face of his son.    \"Fine, dad! I scooted along in great shape. Had an adventure, too.\"    \"You didn't meet any more of those men, did you? The men who are  trying to get my invention?\" asked Mr. Swift apprehensively.    \"No, indeed, dad. I simply had a little run-in with a chap named  Eradicate Andrew Jackson Abraham Lincoln Sampson, otherwise known as  Rad Sampson, and I engaged him to do some whitewashing for us. We do  need some white washing done, don't we, dad?\"    \"What's that?\" asked Mr. Swift, thinking his son was joking.    Then Tom told of the happening.    \"Yes, I think I can find some work for Eradicate to do,\" went on Mr.  Swift. \"There is some dirt in the boiler shop that needs  eradicating, and I think he can do it. But dinner has been waiting  some time. We'll go in now, or Mrs. Baggert will be out after us.\"    Father and son were soon at the table, and Tom was explaining what  he meant to do to improve his motor-cycle. His father offered some  suggestions regarding the placing of the gasolene lever.    \"I'd put it here,\" he said, and with his pencil he began to draw a  diagram on the white table cloth.    \"Oh, my goodness me, Mr. Swift!\" exclaimed Mrs. Baggert. \"Whatever  are you doing?\" and she sprang up in some alarm.    \"What's the matter? Did I upset my tea?\" asked the inventor  innocently.    \"No; but you are soiling a clean tablecloth. Pencil-marks are so  hard to get out. Take a piece of paper, please.\"    \"Oh, is that all?\" rejoined Mr. Swift with a smile. \"Well, Tom, here  is the way I would do that,\" and substituting the back of an  envelope for the tablecloth, he continued the drawing.    Tom was looking over his father's shoulder interestedly, when Mrs.  Baggert, who was taking off some of the dinner dishes, suddenly  asked:    \"Are you expecting a visitor, Mr. Swift?\"    \"A visitor? No. Why?\" asked the inventor quickly.    \"Because I just saw a man going in the machine shop,\" went on the  housekeeper.    \"A man! In the machine shop!\" exclaimed Tom, rising from his chair.  Mr. Swift also got up, and the two hurried from the house. As they  reached the yard they saw a man emerging from the building where Mr.  Swift was constructing his turbine motor. The man had his back  turned toward them and seemed to be sneaking around, as though  desirous of escaping observation.    \"What do you want?\" called Mr. Swift.    The man turned quickly. At the sight of Mr. Swift and Tom he made a  jump to one side and got behind a big packing-box.    \"That's queer,\" spoke Tom. \"I wonder what he wants?\"    \"I'll soon see,\" rejoined Mr. Swift, and he started on a run toward  where the man was hiding. Tom followed his father, and as the two  inventors reached the box the man sprang from behind it and down the  yard to a lane that passed in back of the Swift house. As he ran he  was seen to stuff some papers in his pocket.    \"My plans! He's stolen some of my plans!\" cried Mr. Swift. \"Catch  him, Tom!\"    Tom ran after the stranger, whose curious actions had roused their  suspicions, while Mr. Swift entered the motor shop to ascertain  whether anything had been stolen.          CHAPTER IX.    A FRUITLESS PURSUIT      Down through the yard Tom speeded, in and out among the buildings,  looking on every side for a sight of the bold stranger. No one was  to be seen.    \"He can't be very far ahead,\" thought Tom. \"I ought to catch him  before he gets to the woods. If he reaches there he has a good  chance of getting away.\"    There was a little patch of trees just back of the inventor's house,  not much of a woods, perhaps, but that is what they were called.    \"I wonder if he was some ordinary tramp, looking for what he could  steal, or if he was one of the gang after dad's invention?\" thought  Tom as he sprinted ahead.    By this time the youth was clear of the group of buildings and in  sight of a tall, board fence, which surrounded the Swift estate on  three sides. Here and there, along the barrier, were piled old  packing-cases, so that it would be easy for a fugitive to leap upon  one of them and so get over the fence. Tom thought of this  possibility in a moment.    \"I guess he got over ahead of me,\" the lad exclaimed, and he peered  sharply about. \"I'll catch him on the other side!\"    At that instant Tom tripped over a plank and went down full length,  making quite a racket. When he picked himself up he was surprised to  see the man he was after dart from inside a big box and start for  the fence, near a point where there were some packing-cases piled  up, making a good approach to the barrier. The fugitive had been  hiding, waiting for a chance to escape, and Tom's fall had alarmed  him.    \"Here! Hold on there! Come back!\" cried the youth as he recovered  his wind and leaped forward.    But the man did not stay. With a bound he was up on the pile of  boxes, and the next moment he was poised on top of the fence. Before  leaping down on the other side, a jump at which even a practiced  athlete might well hesitate, the fleeing stranger paused and looked  back. Tom gazed at him and recognized the man in an instant. He was  the third of the mysterious trio whom the lad had seen in the  Mansburg restaurant.    \"Wait a minute! What do you want sneaking around here?\" shouted Tom  as he ran forward. The man returned no answer, and an instant later  disappeared from view on the other side of the fence.    \"He jumped down!\" thought Tom. \"A big leap, too. Well, I've got to  follow. This is a queer proceeding. First one, then the second, and  now the third of those men seem determined to get something here. I  wonder if this one succeeded? I'll soon find out.\"    The lad was up on the pile of packing-cases and over the fence in  almost record time. He caught a glimpse of the fugitive running  toward the woods. Then the boy leaped down, jarring himself  considerably, and took after the man.    But though Tom was a good runner he was handicapped by the fact that  the man had a start of him, and also by the fact that the stranger  had had a chance to rest while hiding for the second time in the big  box, while"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#8)"],[1,"research in natural  philosophy was with us, and, excited by this catastrophe, he entered on  the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of  electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.  All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,  Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by  some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my  accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be  known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew  despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps  most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations;  set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive  creation; and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science,  which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In  this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches  of study appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure  foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.    Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments  are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as  if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the  immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life--the last effort  made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then  hanging in the stars, and ready to envelope me. Her victory was  announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul, which  followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting  studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with  their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.    It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual.  Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and  terrible destruction.          CHAPTER III.      When I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents resolved that I  should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto  attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for  the completion of my education, that I should be made acquainted with  other customs than those of my native country. My departure was  therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day resolved upon  could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred--an omen, as it  were, of my future misery.    Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she  was in the greatest danger. During her illness, many arguments had been  urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had,  at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard that the life of  her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She  attended her sick bed,--her watchful attentions triumphed over the  malignity of the distemper,--Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences  of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my  mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming  symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the  worst event. On her death-bed the fortitude and benignity of this best  of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and  myself:--\"My children,\" she said, \"my firmest hopes of future happiness  were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be  the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my  place to my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you;  and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all?  But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign  myself cheerfully to death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in  another world.\"    She died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death.  I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by  that most irreparable evil; the void that presents itself to the soul;  and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long  before the mind can persuade itself that she, whom we saw every day, and  whose very existence appeared a part of our own, can have departed for  ever--that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished,  and the sound of a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can be  hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first  days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then  the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that  rude hand rent away some dear connection? and why should I describe a  sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives,  when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that  plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not  banished. My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to  perform; we must continue our course with the rest, and learn to think  ourselves fortunate, whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.    My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,  was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of  some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,  akin to death, of the house of mourning, and to rush into the thick of  life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was  unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me; and, above  all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.    She indeed veiled her grief, and strove to act the comforter to us all.  She looked steadily on life, and assumed its duties with courage and  zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her  uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when  she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She  forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.    The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last  evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him  to accompany me, and to become my fellow student; but in vain. His  father was a narrow-minded trader, and saw idleness and ruin in the  aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of  being debarred from a liberal education. He said little; but when he  spoke, I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a  restrained but firm resolve, not to be chained to the miserable details  of commerce.    [Illustration: _The day of my departure at length arrived._]    We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other, nor  persuade ourselves to say the word \"Farewell!\" It was said; and we  retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the  other was deceived: but when at morning's dawn I descended to the  carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there--my father  again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to  renew her entreaties that I would write often, and to bestow the last  feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.    I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged  in the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by  amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual  pleasure, I was now alone. In the university, whither I was going, I  must form my own friends, and be my own protector. My life had hitherto  been remarkably secluded and domestic; and this had given me invincible  repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and  Clerval; these were \"old familiar faces;\" but I believed myself totally  unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I  commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I  ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at  home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place,  and had longed to enter the world, and take my station among other  human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed,  have been folly to repent.    I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my  journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high  white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted, and was conducted to  my solitary apartment, to spend the evening as I pleased.    The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a  visit to some of the principal professors. Chance--or rather the evil  influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over  me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's  door--led me first to Mr. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He  was an uncouth man, but deeply embued in the secrets of his science. He  asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different  branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied  carelessly; and, partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my  alchymists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared:  \"Have you,\" he said, \"really spent your time in studying such nonsense?\"    I replied in the affirmative. \"Every minute,\" continued M. Krempe with  warmth, \"every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly  and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems  and useless names. Good God! in what desert land have you lived, where  no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies, which you have  so greedily imbibed, are a thousand years old, and as musty as they are  ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to  find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must  begin your studies entirely anew.\"    So saying, he stept"]]]
