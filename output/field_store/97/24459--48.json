Each head was in a separate cupboard lined  with velvet.  The cupboards ran all around the sides of the  dressing-room, and had elaborately carved doors with gold numbers on  the outside and jeweled-framed mirrors on the inside of them.    When the Princess got out of her crystal bed in the morning she went to  her cabinet, opened one of the velvet-lined cupboards, and took the  head it contained from its golden shelf.  Then, by the aid of the  mirror inside the open door, she put on the head--as neat and straight  as could be--and afterward called her maids to robe her for the day.  She always wore a simple white costume, that suited all the heads.  For, being able to change her face whenever she liked, the Princess had  no interest in wearing a variety of gowns, as have other ladies who are  compelled to wear the same face constantly.    Of course the thirty heads were in great variety, no two formed alike  but all being of exceeding loveliness.  There were heads with golden  hair, brown hair, rich auburn hair and black hair; but none with gray  hair.  The heads had eyes of blue, of gray, of hazel, of brown and of  black; but there were no red eyes among them, and all were bright and  handsome.  The noses were Grecian, Roman, retrousse and Oriental,  representing all types of beauty; and the mouths were of assorted sizes  and shapes, displaying pearly teeth when the heads smiled.  As for  dimples, they appeared in cheeks and chins, wherever they might be most  charming, and one or two heads had freckles upon the faces to contrast  the better with the brilliancy of their complexions.    One key unlocked all the velvet cupboards containing these treasures--a  curious key carved from a single blood-red ruby--and this was fastened  to a strong but slender chain which the Princess wore around her left  wrist.    When Nanda had supported Langwidere to a position in front of cupboard  No. 17, the Princess unlocked the door with her ruby key and after  handing head No. 9, which she had been wearing, to the maid, she took  No. 17 from its shelf and fitted it to her neck.  It had black hair and  dark eyes and a lovely pearl-and-white complexion, and when Langwidere  wore it she knew she was remarkably beautiful in appearance.    There was only one trouble with No. 17; the temper that went with it  (and which was hidden somewhere under the glossy black hair) was fiery,  harsh and haughty in the extreme, and it often led the Princess to do  unpleasant things which she regretted when she came to wear her other  heads.    But she did not remember this today, and went to meet her guests in the  drawing-room with a feeling of certainty that she would surprise them  with her beauty.    However, she was greatly disappointed to find that her visitors were  merely a small girl in a gingham dress, a copper man that would only go  when wound up, and a yellow hen that was sitting contentedly in  Langwidere's best work-basket, where there was a china egg used for  darning stockings.  (It may surprise you to learn that a princess ever  does such a common thing as darn stockings.  But, if you will stop to  think, you will realize that a princess is sure to wear holes in her  stockings, the same as other people; only it isn't considered quite  polite to mention the matter.)    \"Oh!\" said Langwidere, slightly lifting the nose of No. 17.  \"I thought  some one of importance had called.\"    \"Then you were right,\" declared Dorothy.  \"I'm a good deal of 'portance  myself, and when Billina lays an egg she has the proudest cackle you  ever heard.  As for Tiktok, he's the--\"    \"Stop--Stop!\" commanded the Princess, with an angry flash of her  splendid eyes.  \"How dare you annoy me with your senseless chatter?\"    \"Why, you horrid thing!\" said Dorothy, who was not accustomed to being  treated so rudely.    The Princess looked at her more closely.    \"Tell me,\" she resumed, \"are you of royal blood?\"    \"Better than that, ma'am,\" said Dorothy.  \"I came from Kansas.\"    \"Huh!\" cried the Princess, scornfully.  \"You are a foolish child, and I  cannot allow you to annoy me.  Run away, you little goose, and bother  some one else.\"    Dorothy was so indignant that for a moment she could find no words to  reply.  But she rose from her chair, and was about to leave the room  when the Princess, who had been scanning the girl's face, stopped her  by saying, more gently:    \"Come nearer to me.\"    Dorothy obeyed, without a thought of fear, and stood before the  Princess while Langwidere examined her face with careful attention.    \"You are rather attractive,\" said the lady, presently.  \"Not at all  beautiful, you understand, but you have a certain style of prettiness  that is different from that of any of my thirty heads.  So I believe  I'll take your head and give you No. 26 for it.\"    \"Well, I b'lieve you won't!\" exclaimed Dorothy.    \"It will do you no good to refuse,\" continued the Princess; \"for I need  your head for my collection, and in the Land of Ev my will is law.  I  never have cared much for No. 26, and you will find that it is very  little worn.  Besides, it will do you just as well as the one you're  wearing, for all practical purposes.\"    \"I don't know anything about your No. 26, and I don't want to,\" said  Dorothy, firmly.  \"I'm not used to taking cast-off things, so I'll just  keep my own head.\"    \"You refuse?\" cried the Princess, with a frown.    \"Of course I do,\" was the reply.    \"Then,\" said Langwidere, \"I shall lock you up in a tower until you  decide to obey me.  Nanda,\" turning to her maid, \"call my army.\"    Nanda rang a silver bell, and at once a big fat colonel in a bright red  uniform entered the room, followed by ten lean soldiers, who all looked  sad and discouraged and saluted the princess in a very melancholy  fashion.    \"Carry that girl to the North Tower and lock her up!\" cried the  Princess, pointing to Dorothy.    \"To hear is to obey,\" answered the big red colonel, and caught the  child by her arm.  But at that moment Tiktok raised his dinner-pail and  pounded it so forcibly against the colonel's head that the big officer  sat down upon the floor with a sudden bump, looking both dazed and very  much astonished.    \"Help!\" he shouted, and the ten lean soldiers sprang to assist their  leader.    There was great excitement for the next few moments, and Tiktok had  knocked down seven of the army, who were sprawling in every direction  upon the carpet, when suddenly the machine paused, with the dinner-pail  raised for another blow, and remained perfectly motionless.    \"My ac-tion has run down,\" he called to Dorothy.  \"Wind me up, quick.\"    She tried to obey, but the big colonel had by this time managed to get  upon his feet again, so he grabbed fast hold of the girl and she was  helpless to escape.    \"This is too bad,\" said the machine.  \"I ought to have run six hours  lon-ger, at least, but I sup-pose my long walk and my fight with the  Wheel-ers made me run down fast-er than us-u-al.\"    \"Well, it can't be helped,\" said Dorothy, with a sigh.    \"Will you exchange heads with me?\" demanded the Princess.    \"No, indeed!\" cried Dorothy.    \"Then lock her up,\" said Langwidere to her soldiers, and they led  Dorothy to a high tower at the north of the palace and locked her  securely within.    The soldiers afterward tried to lift Tiktok, but they found the machine  so solid and heavy that they could not stir it.  So they left him  standing in the center of the drawing-room.    \"People will think I have a new statue,\" said Langwidere, \"so it won't  matter in the least, and Nanda can keep him well polished.\"    \"What shall we do with the hen?\" asked the colonel, who had just  discovered Billina in the work-basket.    \"Put her in the chicken-house,\" answered the Princess.  \"Someday I'll  have her fried for breakfast.\"    \"She looks rather tough, Your Highness,\" said Nanda, doubtfully.    \"That is a base slander!\" cried Billina, struggling frantically in the  colonel's arms.  \"But the breed of chickens I come from is said to be  poison to all princesses.\"    \"Then,\" remarked Langwidere, \"I will not fry the hen, but keep her to  lay eggs; and if she doesn't do her duty I'll have her drowned in the  horse trough.\"          7.  Ozma of Oz to the Rescue      Nanda brought Dorothy bread and water for her supper, and she slept  upon a hard stone couch with a single pillow and a silken coverlet.    In the morning she leaned out of the window of her prison in the tower  to see if there was any way to escape.  The room was not so very high  up, when compared with our modern buildings, but it was far enough  above the trees and farm houses to give her a good view of the  surrounding country.    To the east she saw the forest, with the sands beyond it and the ocean  beyond that.  There was even a dark speck upon the shore that she  thought might be the chicken-coop in which she had arrived at this  singular country.    Then she looked to the north, and saw a deep but narrow valley lying  between two rocky mountains, and a third mountain that shut off the  valley at the further end.    Westward the fertile Land of Ev suddenly ended a little way from the  palace, and the girl could see miles and miles of sandy desert that  stretched further than her eyes could reach.  It was this desert, she  thought, with much interest, that alone separated her from the  wonderful Land of Oz, and she remembered sorrowfully that she had been  told no one had ever been able to cross this dangerous waste but  herself.  Once a cyclone had carried her across it, and a magical pair  of silver shoes had carried her back again.  But now she had neither a  cyclone nor silver shoes to assist her, and her condition was sad  indeed.

[48]    Until area commanders could be selected for the 7th, 8th, and  9th (Leyte) Districts, Peralta and Fertig had been authorized by  MacArthur's headquarters, through Parsons, to organize the guerrillas  on neighboring islands, as well as on their own. Each thought he  was to organize the guerrillas on Leyte. Peralta made contact with  General Miranda on northwestern Leyte; Fertig got in touch with  Colonel Kangleon. Both Peralta and Fertig told their contacts to  organize Leyte with the official sanction of General MacArthur's  headquarters. Consequently, Kangleon and Miranda each thought the  other to be a usurper. [49]    Miranda was adamant in his refusal to treat with Kangleon. Colonel  Kangleon thought that Miranda should be ordered to \"forget his  established kingdom,\" but if this failed, he declared, the 92d  Division, commanded by himself, would \"force ... Miranda to join  us.\" [50]    The situation became extremely tense, since both Kangleon and Miranda  felt much bitterness. In August 1943 Kangleon sent a force against  Miranda and during a clash between the two parties some of the men  were killed. Miranda was routed and many of his followers joined  Kangleon. [51] The power of Miranda was broken. Kangleon incorporated  the other guerrillas on the island into the 92d Division, and Leyte  was then unified under his command.    On 21 October 1943 General MacArthur recognized Colonel Kangleon as the  Leyte Area Commander, and in a letter accompanying the appointment he  told Kangleon what he expected of him. \"I desire that you establish and  maintain direct communication with this headquarters at your earliest  opportunity and thereafter you keep me informed of major developments  involving enemy movement, dispositions and other activity within your  area and observation.\" [52]        Japanese Punitive Expeditions    In the latter part of 1943 the Japanese military authorities tried to  conciliate the guerrillas, offering, in return for their surrender,  not only freedom from punishment but also jobs and the opportunity to  resume their normal family life. A great many guerrillas took advantage  of this offer of amnesty and surrendered. [53] Among the guerrilla  units that surrendered to the Japanese were those of Maj. Marcos  G. Soliman and other subordinates of General Miranda's command. [54]  They gave themselves up in January 1944, but General Miranda himself  refused to surrender and left for either Cebu or Bohol.    After their attempts at pacification, the Japanese launched more  frequent and intensive patrols against the guerrillas. The garrison  troops that had been stationed on Leyte were reinforced. Southern  Leyte, which had known few Japanese, was \"reinvolved\" on 8 December  1943. The guerrillas withdrew and hid in the interior. It was  thought that after a month the troops would leave and be replaced by  constabulary officers. But after two weeks the Japanese turned their  attention to the civilians. Some they arrested and imprisoned for  days without food and water, others they tortured and executed. Houses  were broken into, property was looted, and food was stolen. Spies were  brought in from neighboring islands to locate the guerrilla hideouts.    Since the people begged for action, Colonel Kangleon held a meeting of  his unit commanders on 24 January 1944. With his officers in unanimous  accord, he issued an order to fight, commencing on 1 February 1944. All  officers and enlisted men of his command signed a loyalty oath that  they would not allow either themselves or their weapons to be captured.    From 1 February until 12 June, according to Colonel Kangleon, the  guerrillas in southern Leyte had only 10 casualties. In a report  dated 18 May 1944, the Japanese casualties were listed as 434 killed,  of whom 4 were officers, and 205 wounded.    The Japanese commander in Leyte made quite a different report. He  stated that from 1 January to 31 August his forces had taken part  in 561 engagements with the guerrillas. They had seized 7 vehicles;  7 generators; 37 radios and other items of wireless equipment;  1,556 weapons, including rifles, bayonets, and homemade shotguns;  and 55,348 rounds of ammunition, as well as sticks of dynamite. The  Japanese declared that they had taken 2,300 prisoners of war, including  3 Americans; that 6 Americans and 23,077 Filipinos had surrendered;  1,984 guerrillas had been killed; and that the Japanese casualties  amounted to 7 officers and 208 enlisted men killed, and 11 officers  and 147 men wounded. [55]    In the month of October 1944 General MacArthur's Military Intelligence  Section estimated that the strength of the guerrilla 92d Division  was as follows: Headquarters, Leyte Area Command, 23 officers and  107 enlisted men; 94th Regiment, 71 officers and 1,210 enlisted men;  95th Regiment, 78 officers and 954 enlisted men; 96th Regiment,  37 officers and 710 enlisted men; total strength, 209 officers and  2,981 enlisted men. [56]    Colonel Kangleon stated that as a result of guerrilla activities the  Japanese sent out fewer patrols, staying mainly in the towns. The  civilians, he claimed, were therefore able to plant and harvest their  crops. Despite these brave words the guerrillas were definitely on  the defensive, since Japanese intelligence had accurate information on  their movements and strength. Nevertheless, the Japanese also knew that  the guerrillas had established communication with General MacArthur  in Australia and that they were sending important information to  General Headquarters. This service the Japanese were unable to cut off.          Liaison Between Leyte and Australia    After his arrival in Australia in March 1942, General MacArthur had  maintained radio contact with Corregidor until 6 May, but because  of conditions in the Philippines radio communication with other  parts of the Islands was all but impossible. [57] Before its fall,  Corregidor maintained radio contact with military commanders on the  other islands. Afterward, a few men escaped and made their way to  Australia. The sum of information they brought was not large, but it  included the welcome news that guerrilla units were in existence all  over the Islands. In the summer of 1942 General Headquarters began  to receive messages from the guerrillas in the Philippines, though  at first General MacArthur was not sure that the messages actually  came from the guerrillas.    In August 1942 MacArthur decided to get in touch with the members of  the resistance movement in the Philippines, and for this purpose he  enlisted the services of Maj. Jesus Antonio Villamor, who had escaped  from the Islands and who volunteered to return. [58] From August  to December methods were devised and plans were made for sending  an intelligence party to the Philippines. [59] On 27 December 1942  Major Villamor received orders to return secretly to the Islands by  submarine with three other Filipino officers and two enlisted men. [60]  They were instructed to establish an intelligence and secret service  network throughout the Philippines; develop a chain of communications  within the Philippines and to Australia, together with an escape route  from the Islands for the evacuation of important personages; build  up an organization for subversive activities, propaganda, limited  resistance, and sabotage; and make an intelligence survey to obtain  information on Japanese political, military, and civil intentions  as well as the strength and disposition of Japanese military, naval,  and air forces. [61]    Armed with these instructions, Major Villamor returned to the  Philippine Islands. Slowly but carefully, from December 1942 to  November 1943, he established an intelligence network that covered  Luzon and the Visayan Islands. His story is told in part as follows:          I established this network principally with the idea that this net      would be entirely independent of all intelligence nets previously      established by the guerrillas, believing that in all probability      you [General MacArthur] could rely more on guerrilla intelligence      activities for the present. I wanted to establish something that      would really be underground and as secret as possible. For that      reason, I took my time about it. I took as much as two months to      train each individual man. I tried to impress on each man that      after he left my place, he would be on his own and that no matter      what happened to me or to the rest of the net, he would carry      on. I assured him that both GHQ and I would have faith in him. [62]      Kangleon was largely responsible for the Leyte radio network. This  intelligence network did not cover the entire island but only those  positions over which he had control. General MacArthur did not furnish  any considerable supplies for this net until shortly before his return  in October 1944. [63] On 3 July 1944 Kangleon received seventy tons  of supplies; an additional shipment of supplies and men followed on  20 July. [64] This allotment was in addition to money sent him. The  funds available to Kangleon consisted of $50,000 in prewar currency  (\"only a few hundred\" of which were spent by him), $225,000 in \"bogus  Japanese\" currency, and $479,198 in emergency currency printed in  the Islands and used for \"army\" purposes. [65]    Several clandestine radio stations were in operation on or near  Leyte in June 1944. These were primarily contact stations established  originally to integrate more closely the activities of the various  guerrilla units with the directives of Colonel Kangleon's headquarters,  which was in touch with General Headquarters. After the Leyte Area  Command was recognized by General MacArthur, the first radio was sent  to Leyte, but the Japanese captured it early in 1944 before it could  be put to use. Kangleon received a new set from Mindanao. There were"]]]
