I then got a big armful of shavings from a carpenter's  bench which was close by, put them under the bed and set fire to them.  As soon as the sham invalid felt the heat, he peeped over the edge of  the blanket; and when he saw the smoke and flame leaping up round him,  he threw the blanket from him, sprang from the bed exclaiming \"Beiman  shaitan!\" (\"Unbelieving devil!\"), and fled like a deer to the entrance  of my boma, pursued by a Sikh sepoy, who got in a couple of good whacks  on his shoulders with a stout stick before he effected his escape. His  amused comrades greeted me with shouts of \"Shabash, Sahib!\" (\"Well  done, sir\"), and I never had any further trouble with Karim Bux. He  came back later in the day, with clasped hands imploring forgiveness,  which I readily granted, as he was a clever workman.    A few days after this incident I was returning home one morning from a  tree in which I had been keeping watch for the man-eaters during the  previous night. Coming unexpectedly on the quarry, I was amazed to find  dead silence reigning and my rascals of workmen all stretched out in  the shade under the trees taking it very easy--some sleeping, some  playing cards. I watched their proceedings through the bushes for a  little while, and then it occurred to me to give them a fright by  firing my rifle over their heads. On the report being heard, the scene  changed like magic: each man simply flew to his particular work, and  hammers and chisels resounded merrily and energetically, where all had  been silence a moment before. They thought, of course, that I was still  some distance off and had not seen them, but to their consternation I  shouted to them that they were too late, as I had been watching them  for some time. I fined every man present heavily, besides summarily  degrading the Headman, who had thus shown himself utterly unfit for his  position. I then proceeded to my hut, but had scarcely arrived there  when two of the scoundrels tottered up after me, bent almost double and  calling Heaven to witness that I had shot them both in the back. In  order to give a semblance of truth to an otherwise bald and  unconvincing narrative, they had actually induced one of their fellow  workmen to make a few holes like shot holes in their backs, and these  were bleeding profusely. Unfortunately for them, however, I had been  carrying a rifle and not a shot gun, and they had also forgotten to  make corresponding holes in their clothing, so that all they achieved  by this elaborate tissue of falsehood was to bring on themselves the  derision of their comrades and the imposition of an extra fine.    Shortly after this, when the masons realised that I intended to make  each man do a fair day's work for his money, and would allow nothing to  prevent this intention from being carried out, they came to the  conclusion that the best thing to do would be to put me quietly out of  the way. Accordingly they held a meeting one night, all being sworn to  secrecy, and after a long palaver it was arranged that I was to be  murdered next day when I made my usual visit to the quarry. My body was  to be thrown into the jungle, where of course it would soon be devoured  by wild beasts, and then they were to say that I had been killed and  eaten by a lion. To this cheerful proposal every man present at the  meeting agreed, and affixed his finger-mark to a long strip of paper as  a binding token. Within an hour after the meeting had dispersed,  however, I was aroused by one of the conspirators, who had crept into  my camp to give me warning. I thanked him for his information, but  determined to go to the quarry in the morning all the same, as at this  stage of affairs I really did not believe that they were capable of  carrying out such a diabolical scheme, and was rather inclined to think  that the informant had been sent merely to frighten me.    Accordingly the next morning (September 6) I started off as usual along  the trolley line to the lonely quarry. As I reached a bend in the line,  my head mason, Heera Singh, a very good man, crept cautiously out of  the bushes and warned me not to proceed. On my asking him the reason,  he said that he dared not tell, but that he and twenty other masons  were not going to work that day, as they were afraid of trouble at the  quarry. At this I began to think that there was something in the story  I had heard overnight, but I laughingly assured him there would be no  trouble and continued on my way. On my arrival at the quarry,  everything seemed perfectly peaceful. All the men were working away  busily, but after a moment or two I noticed stealthy side glances, and  felt that there was something in the wind. As soon as I came up to the  first gang of workmen, the jemadar, a treacherous-looking villain,  informed me that the men working further up the ravine had refused to  obey his orders, and asked me if I would go and see them. I felt at  once that this was a device to lure me into the narrow part of the  ravine, where, with gangs in front of me and behind me, there would be  no escape; still I thought I would see the adventure through, whatever  came of it, so I accompanied the jemadar up the gully. When we got to  the further gang, he went so far as to point out the two men who, he  said, had refused to do what he told them--I suppose he thought that as  I was never to leave the place alive, it did not matter whom he  complained of. I noted their names in my pocket-book in my usual  manner, and turned to retrace my steps. Immediately a yell of rage was  raised by the whole body of some sixty men, answered by a similar shout  from those I had first passed, and who numbered about a hundred. Both  groups of men, carrying crowbars and flourishing their heavy hammers,  then closed in on me in the narrow part of the ravine. I stood still,  waiting for them to act, and one man rushed at me, seizing both my  wrists and shouting out that he was going to \"be hung and shot for  me\"--rather a curious way of putting it, but that was his exact  expression. I easily wrenched my arms free, and threw him from me; but  by this time I was closely hemmed in, and everywhere I looked I could  see nothing but evil and murderous-looking faces. One burly brute,  afraid to be the first to deal a blow, hurled the man next him at me;  and if he had succeeded in knocking me down, I am certain that I should  never have got up again alive. As it was, however, I stepped quickly  aside, and the man intended to knock me down was himself thrown  violently against a rock, over which he fell heavily.    This occasioned a moment's confusion, of which I quickly took  advantage. I sprang on to the top of the rock, and before they had time  to recover themselves I had started haranguing them in Hindustani. The  habit of obedience still held them, and fortunately they listened to  what I had to say. I told them that I knew all about their plot to  murder me, and that they could certainly do so if they wished; but that  if they did, many of them would assuredly be hanged for it, as the  Sirkar (Government) would soon find out the truth and would disbelieve  their story that I had been carried off by a lion. I said that I knew  quite well that it was only one or two scoundrels among them who had  induced them to behave so stupidly, and urged them not to allow  themselves to be made fools of in this way. Even supposing they were to  carry out their plan of killing me, would not another \"Sahib\" at once  be set over them, and might he not be an even harder task-master? They  all knew that I was just and fair to the real worker; it was only the  scoundrels and shirkers who had anything to fear from me, and were  upright, self-respecting. Pathans going to allow themselves to be led  away by men of that kind? Once having got them to listen to me, I felt  a little more secure, and I accordingly went on to say that the  discontented among them would be allowed to return at once to Mombasa,  while if the others resumed work and I heard of no further plotting, I  would take no notice of their foolish conduct. Finally I called upon  those who were willing to return to work to hold up their hands, and  instantly every hand in the crowd was raised. I then felt that for the  moment the victory was mine, and after dismissing them, I jumped down  from the rock and continued my rounds as if nothing had happened,  measuring a stone here and there and commenting on the work done. They  were still in a very uncertain and sullen mood, however, and not at all  to be relied upon, so it was with feelings of great relief that an hour  later I made my way back, safe and sound, to Tsavo.    The danger was not yet past, unfortunately, for scarcely had I turned  my back to go home when the mutiny broke out again, another meeting  being held, and a fresh plot made to murder me during the night. Of  this I was soon informed by my time-keeper, who also told me that he  was afraid to go out and call the roll, as they had threatened to kill  him also. At this further outrage I lost no time in telegraphing for  the Railway Police, and also to the District Officer, Mr. Whitehead,  who immediately marched his men twenty-five miles by road to my  assistance. I have no doubt, indeed, that his prompt action alone saved  me from being attacked that very night. Two or three days afterwards  the Railway Police arrived and arrested the ringleaders in the mutiny,  who were taken to Mombasa and tried before Mr. Crawford, the British  Consul, when the full details of the plots to murder me were unfolded  by one of them who turned Queen's evidence. All the scoundrels were  found guilty and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment in the  chain-gangs,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38189"],[0,"A Treatise on Sheep: (#8)"],[1," years after the conquest of the country.    It has been believed, from Britain having been partly peopled from  Spain, that our sheep were originally Spanish; and, as Giraldus  Cambrensis (Collectan. de Reb. Hibern.) affirms, that the Irish in his  time were clothed in black garments, from the wool of their sheep  being so coloured, some have supposed the sheep of that island were  imported from Spain, a supposition rendered probable by Southey  telling us, in his letters from that country, that in the north of the  Peninsula the animals are almost all of a black colour.    No mention ever occurs in the ancient writers, of the importation of  sheep into Britain, from which it may be supposed, that they had found  their way into it long before its forcible separation from the  continent by natural convulsions. Cambden, in his work on Britain,  quotes from an old orator, part of a beautiful panegyric on the great  Constantine, in which the happiness of Britain is eloquently  described, and its advantages in regard to sheep graphically depicted.  \"Innumerable are thy herds of cattle, and thy flocks of sheep, which  feed thee plentifully, and clothe thee richly.\" So that, even allowing  for the high-flown nature of the verbiage, the sheep of the island  must have been far from indifferent, and well worthy of any trouble  the grasping Romans may have been put to, in the erection of  manufactories.    (41.) _Importance of the British Woollen Manufacture._--The history of  our wool, and the woollen manufacture, is, at one period and in one  point of view, the history of our public revenue, while in a  succeeding period it becomes the capital object of our commerce, and  the important subject of our political councils. The preserving and  supporting it against foreign rivals, the due regulation of its  numerous branches, and the proper restrictions deemed requisite to  ensure to this country the commercial benefits resulting from it, have  occupied our ablest statesmen for many centuries.    The wools of England have always been in the highest repute, and that  more abroad than at home. Their fineness and abundance have been  ascribed by many to the sweet short grass on most of our downs and  pastures, and to the sheep having the privilege of feeding, all the  year round, without being shut in folds; but it cannot be denied,  that, though food and climate may have much concern in the matter, the  energetic industry and persevering attention with which an Englishman  devotes himself to the attainment of an object, have tended more than  any other circumstance to the advancement of our wools, and woollen  manufactures, and to the consequent prosperity of our island.    The reason of the existence of so many laws relating to wool is, that  it continued for ages to be the principal commodity, meeting all  demands for the support of armies, and payment of public revenues, and  affording aids to the crown, which were in general granted therein.  The scarcity of money in England before the discovery of America,  rendered it necessary to levy taxes frequently in kind, and as wool  was abundant, it often figured as the representative of a more  portable currency. Part of the L300,000 demanded by the Emperor of  Germany as the ransom of Richard I., was raised by a loan of wool.  Edward I., the great reformer of our laws, imposed a duty of 6s. 8d.  on every sack of wool exported, and the like sum on every 300  wool-fells; but soon after, when his necessities demanded a larger  income, he laid those additional duties on foreign merchants, which  afterwards became the tonnage and poundage, so famous in England's  history. Among these additions, the former taxes on wool and fells  were increased by forty pence, while at the same time, like other  monarchs of the period, he occasionally received subsidies of wool. In  the same way Edward III., in attempting, during the twelfth year of  his reign, to wrest the crown of France from the house of Valois,  procured a grant of half the wool in England, amounting to 20,000  packs, which, taking it as valued by some authors at L40 a pack, must  have realized the sum of L800,000.    (42.) _Weavers brought from Flanders._--Commerce and industry were at  a very low ebb during the time of Edward III., the principal export  being wool, which only brought into the kingdom about L450,000. Edward  promoted the woollen manufacture by bringing, in 1331, John Kemp, with  seventy Walloon families, weavers, from Flanders, and, owing to the  want of native skill in this department, gave every encouragement to  foreign weavers. (11 Edward III. cap. 5.)[6] A further encouragement  was given to the home manufacture, by the enactment of a law (11  Edward III. cap. 2) which prohibited every one from wearing any cloth  not of English fabric. Parliament, however, in an evil hour, thwarted  these benefits, by prohibiting the exportation of woollen goods,  certainly an injurious step, so long as wool was allowed to be shipped  from our ports.            [6] Macpherson, in his Annals of Commerce, agrees with          Bloomfield the historian of Norfolk, that a colony of Flemish          weavers settled so early as 1327, at Worsted, a village in          that county, and bestowed upon it the name it bears.    On the introduction of the Flemish weavers, Kendal became the  metropolis of this branch of industry, and was soon equalled in the  extent of its manufactories by many other towns, as Norwich, Sudbury,  Colchester, and York; while woollens were spun and wove, though to a  less extent, in Devonshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire,  Hampshire, Berkshire Sussex, and Wales.    (43.) _Regulations regarding Staples._--The _staple_, or market for  wool, was fixed by act of Parliament (27 Edward III.) in particular  towns of England, but was afterwards removed by law to Calais, and  English merchants were prohibited from exporting any goods from the  staple, or, in other words, foreign navigation was abandoned. To the  custom of taking subsidies in kind, may be traced the principle of  those multifarious regulations which fixed the staple in certain  towns, either in England, or more commonly on the continent; and to  the fluctuating state of politics may be ascribed the shiftings which  those staples so frequently underwent; but it is not easy to see the  drift of many of the provisions relating to it, some of which tend to  the benefit of foreign, rather than of British, commerce.    (44.) The progress which this manufacture made in a very short period,  may be well illustrated by the following table of exports and imports  in woollen, about the middle of the fourteenth century, or twenty  years after the arrival of John Kemp and his establishment.      EXPORTS.      Thirty-one thousand, six hundred and    fifty-one and a half of wool, at L.6    value each sack,                          L189,909  0  0      Three thousand, thirty-six hundred    and sixty-five fells, at 40s. value,    each hundred at six score,                   6,073  1  8      Whereof the custom amounts to               81,624  1  1      Fourteen last, seventeen dicker, and    five hides of leather, after L.6 value    the last                                        89  5  0      Whereof the custom amounts to.                   6 17  6      8,061-1/2 of worsted, after 16s. 8d. value,    the price is                                 6,717 18  4      Whereof the custom amounts to                  215 13  7                                             ---------------    Summary of the out-carried commodities    in value and custom,                      L285,635 17  2                                             ---------------        IMPORTS.      1,832 cloths, after L.6 value each,         10,922  0  0      Whereof the custom amounts to                   91 12  0                                             ---------------      Summary of the in-brought woollens    in value and custom,                       L11,013 12  0    That the imported cloths were much finer than those exported, may be  inferred from their comparative value as here stated, and we may  conclude pretty justly, that the fabrication of coarse cloths  exclusively occupied the manufacturers of Britain, while the finer  fabrics were still brought from abroad, and that, in fact, the wants  of the _mass_ of the people were the regulators of British industry.    (45.) _Subsidies raised by Edward III._--In 1338, Edward took a  fifteenth of all the commonalty of his realm in wool, rating the price  of every stone of 14 lbs. at 2s., although, in the previous November,  he had sent the Bishop of Lincoln, and the Earls of Suffolk and  Northampton, with one thousand sacks of wool, into Brabant, which,  being sold at L.40 a sack, procured him L.40,000. Edward was  apparently not very sure how far his subjects would submit to so  sweeping a taxation, as we find him addressing a letter, dated  Berwick-upon-Tweed, March 28th, 1338, to the Archbishops of York and  Canterbury, desiring the favour of their prayers, and requesting that  they would excuse him to his people, on account of the great taxes he  was obliged to lay upon them. During the summer of 1339, the laity  granted to the king the one-half of their wools throughout the whole  realm, a favour his majesty is reported to have received most  graciously; but of the clergy he levied the whole, compelling them to  pay nine merks for every sack of the best wool. Knighton, who held an  office in the Abbey of Leicester, says that that house alone furnished  eighteen sacks. The revenue officers during this reign appear to have  exercised their calling with great strictness, and to have interfered  in an especial manner with the secret trade of the inhabitants of  Bristol, but this was terminated by the king granting a licence, dated  Langley, November 25th, 1339, to their weavers, allowing them \"to make  woollen cloth without being liable to any"]]]
