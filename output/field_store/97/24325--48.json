It took this fleet three months to make the voyage from  Constantinople to Africa. The same voyage may now be made in a very  few days. But in the time of Belisarius there were no steamships,  and nothing was known of the power of steam for moving machinery.  The ships or galleys were sailing vessels; and when there was no  wind they could make no progress except by rowing.    When Belisarius reached Africa he left five men as a guard in each  vessel, and with the body of his army he marched for some days  along the coast. The people received him in a friendly way, for  they had grown tired of the rule of the Vandals, and preferred  to be under the government of the Romans.    About ten miles from Carthage he met a large army led by the brother  of Gelimer. A battle immediately took place, and the Vandals were  utterly defeated. Gelimer's brother was killed, and the king himself,  who had followed with another army and joined the fight, was also  defeated and fled from the field. Belisarius then proceeded to  Carthage and took possession of the city.    [Illustration: THE BATTLE AT CARTHAGE]    Soon afterwards Gelimer collected another army and fought the Romans  in another battle, twenty miles from Carthage; but Belisarius again  defeated him and the Vandal king again fled. This was the end of  the Vandal king in Africa. In a short time Gelimer gave himself  up to Belisarius, who took him to Constantinople. Justinian set  apart an estate for him to live upon, and the conquered king passed  the rest of his life in peaceful retirement.    After conquering the Vandals Justinian resolved to conquer Italy,  which was then held by the Ostrogoths. A large army was got together  and put under the command of Belisarius and Narses, who immediately  set out for Italy. When they arrived there they marched straight  to Rome, and after some fighting took possession of the city. But  in a few months, Vit'i-ges, king of the Goths, appeared with an  army before the gates and challenged Belisarius and Narses to come  out and fight.    The Roman generals, however, were not then ready to fight, and so  the Ostrogoth king laid siege to the city, thinking that he would  compel the Romans to surrender.    But instead of having any thought of surrender, Belisarius was  preparing his men for fight, and when they were ready he attacked  Vitiges and defeated him. Vitiges retired to Ravenna, and Belisarius  quickly followed, and made such an assault on the city that it  was compelled to surrender. The Ostrogoth army was captured, and  Vitiges was taken to Constantinople a prisoner.    Belisarius and Narses then went to Northern Italy, and, after a long  war, conquered all the tribes there. Thus the power of Justinian  was established throughout the whole country, and the city of Rome  was again under the dominion of a Roman emperor.    [Illustration: BELISARIUS BESIEGES RAVENNA]    While his brave generals were winning these victories for the Empire,  Justinian himself was busy in making improvements of various kinds  at the capital. He erected great public buildings, which were not  only useful but ornamental to the city. The most remarkable of  them was the very magnificent cathedral of St. So-phi'a, for a  long time the grandest church structure in the world. The great  temple still exists in all its beauty and grandeur, but is now  used as a Mohammedan mosque.    But the most important thing that Justinian did--the work for which  he is most celebrated--was the improving and collecting of the  laws. He made many excellent new laws and reformed many of the old  laws, so that he became famous as one of the greatest of the world's  legislators. For a long time the Roman laws had been difficult to  understand. There was a vast number of them, and different writers  differed widely as to what the laws really were and what they meant.  Justinian employed a great lawyer, named Trib-o'ni-an, to collect  and simplify the principal laws. The collection which he made was  called the CODE OF JUSTINIAN. It still exists, and is the model  according to which most of the countries of Europe have made their  laws.    Justinian also did a great deal of good by establishing a number  of manufactures in Constantinople. It was he who first brought  silk-worms into Europe.    To the last year of his life Justinian was strong and active and  a hard worker. He often worked or studied all day and all night  without eating or sleeping. He died in 565 at the age of eighty-three  years.          MOHAMMED    LIVED FROM 570-632 A.D.    I    A great number of people in Asia and Africa and much of those in  Turkey in Europe profess the Mo-ham'me-dan religion. They are called  Mohammedans, Mus'sul-mans or Moslems; and the proper name for their  religion is \"Islam,\" which means obedience, or submission.    The founder of this religion was a man named Mo-ham'med, or Ma-hom'et.  He was born in the year 570, in Mecca, a city of Arabia. His parents  were poor people, though, it is said, they were descended from  Arabian princes. They died when Mohammed was a child, and his uncle,  a kind-hearted man named A'bu-Ta-lib', took him home and brought  him up.    When the boy grew old enough he took care of his uncle's sheep and  camels. Sometimes he went on journeys with his uncle to different  parts of Arabia, to help him in his business as a trader. On these  journeys Mohammed used to ride on a camel, and he soon became a  skillful camel-driver.    Mohammed was very faithful and honest in all his work. He always  spoke the truth and never broke a promise. \"I have given my promise,\"  he would say, \"and I must keep it.\" He became so well known in  Mecca for being truthful and trustworthy that people gave him the  name of El Amin, which means \"the truthful.\"    At this time he was only sixteen years of age; but the rich traders  had so much confidence in him that they gave him important business  to attend to, and trusted him with large sums of money. He often  went with caravans to a port on the shore of the Red Sea, sixty-five  miles from Mecca, and sold there the goods carried by the camels.  Then he guided the long line of camels back to Mecca, and faithfully  paid over to the owners of the goods the money he had received.    Mohammed had no school education. He could neither read nor write.  But he was not ignorant. He knew well how to do the work intrusted  to him, and was a first-rate man of business.    II    One day, when Mohammed was about twenty-five years old, he was  walking through the bazaar or market-place, of Mecca when he met  the chief camel-driver of a wealthy woman named Kha-di'jah. This  woman was a widow, who was carrying on the business left her by  her husband. As soon as the camel-driver saw Mohammed he stopped  him and said:    \"My mistress wishes to see you before noon. I think she intends  to engage you to take charge of her caravans.\"    Mohammed waited to hear no more. As quickly as possible he went  to the house of Khadijah; for he was well pleased at the thought  of being employed in so important a service. The widow received  him in a very friendly way. She said:    \"I have heard much of you among the traders. They say that though  you are so young you are a good caravan manager and can be trusted.  Are you willing to take charge of my caravans and give your whole  time and service to me?\"    Mohammed was delighted.    \"I accept your offer,\" said he, \"and I shall do all I can to serve  and please you.\"    Khadijah then engaged him as the manager of her business; and he  served her well and faithfully. She thought a great deal of him,  and he was much attracted to her, and soon they came to love one  another and were married.    As he was now the husband of a rich woman he did not need to work  very hard. He still continued to attend to his wife's business;  but he did not make so many journeys as before. He spent much of  his time in thinking about religion. He learned all that he could  about Judaism and Christianity; but he was not satisfied with either  of them.    At that time most of the people of Arabia worshiped idols. Very  few of them were Christians.    Mohammed was very earnest and serious. In a cave on Mount Hira, near  Mecca, he spent several weeks every year in prayer and religious  meditation. He declared that, while praying in his cave, he often  had visions of God and heaven. He said that many times the angel  Gabriel appeared to him and revealed to him the religion which he  afterwards taught his followers. As he himself could not write,  he committed to memory all that the angel told him, and had it  written in a book. This book is called the \"Koran,\" which means,  like our own word Bible, the \"Book.\" The Koran is the Bible of  Mohammedans.    III    When Mohammed returned home after the angel had first spoken to  him, he told his wife of what he had seen and heard. She at once  believed and so became a convert to the new religion. She fell  upon her knees at the feet of her husband and cried out:    \"There is but one God. Mohammed is God's prophet.\"    Mohammed then told the story to other members of his family. Some  of them believed and became his first followers. Soon afterwards  he began to preach to the people. He spoke in the market and other  public places. Most of those who heard him laughed at what he told  them; but some poor people and a few slaves believed him and adopted  the new religion. Others said he was a dreamer and a fool.    Mohammed, however, paid no heed to the insults he received. He  went on telling about the appearance of Gabriel and preaching the  doctrines which he said the angel had ordered him to teach the  people.    Often while speaking in public Mohammed had what he called a \"vision  of heavenly things.\" At such times his face grew pale as death,  his eyes became red and staring, he spoke in a loud"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3726"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume I (#8)"],[1,"and endure, as long as it shall pleasure us, with order meet and  assured delight and without reproach, I first of all constitute Dioneo's  man, Parmeno, my seneschal, and entrust him with the care and control of all  our household, and all that belongs to the service of the hall. Pamfilo's  man, Sirisco, I appoint treasurer and chancellor of our exchequer; and be he  ever answerable to Parmeno. While Parmeno and Sirisco are too busy about  their duties to serve their masters, let Filostrato's man, Tindaro, have  charge of the chambers of all three. My maid, Misia, and Filomena's maid,  Licisca, will keep in the kitchen, and with all due diligence prepare such  dishes as Parmeno shall bid them. Lauretta's maid, Chimera, and Fiammetta's  maid, Stratilia we make answerable for the ladies' chambers, and wherever we  may take up our quarters, let them see that all is spotless. And now we  enjoin you, one and all alike, as you value our favour, that none of you, go  where you may, return whence you may, hear or see what you may, bring us any  tidings but such as be cheerful.\" These orders thus succinctly given were  received with universal approval. Whereupon Pampinea rose, and said  gaily:--\"Here are gardens, meads, and other places delightsome enough, where  you may wander at will, and take your pleasure; but on the stroke of tierce,  (3) let all be here to breakfast in the shade.\"    Thus dismissed by their new queen the gay company sauntered gently through a  garden, the young men saying sweet things to the fair ladies, who wove fair  garlands of divers sorts of leaves and sang love-songs.    Having thus spent the time allowed them by the queen, they returned to the  house, where they found that Parmeno had entered on his office with zeal;  for in a hall on the ground-floor they saw tables covered with the whitest  of cloths, and beakers that shone like silver, and sprays of broom scattered  everywhere. So, at the bidding of the queen, they washed their hands, and  all took their places as marshalled by Parmeno. Dishes, daintily prepared,  were served, and the finest wines were at hand; the three serving-men did  their office noiselessly; in a word all was fair and ordered in a seemly  manner; whereby the spirits of the company rose, and they seasoned their  viands with pleasant jests and sprightly sallies. Breakfast done, the tables  were removed, and the queen bade fetch instruments of music; for all, ladies  and young men alike, knew how to tread a measure, and some of them played  and sang with great skill: so, at her command, Dioneo having taken a lute,  and Fiammetta a viol, they struck up a dance in sweet concert; and, the  servants being dismissed to their repast, the queen, attended by the other  ladies and the two young men, led off a stately carol; which ended they fell  to singing ditties dainty and gay. Thus they diverted themselves until the  queen, deeming it time to retire to rest, dismissed them all for the night.  So the three young men and the ladies withdrew to their several quarters,  which were in different parts of the palace. There they found the beds well  made, and abundance of flowers, as in the hall; and so they undressed, and  went to bed.    Shortly after none (4) the queen rose, and roused the rest of the ladies, as  also the young men, averring that it was injurious to health to sleep long  in the daytime. They therefore hied them to a meadow, where the grass grew  green and luxuriant, being nowhere scorched by the sun, and a light breeze  gently fanned them. So at the queen's command they all ranged themselves in  a circle on the grass, and hearkened while she thus spoke:--    \"You mark that the sun is high, the heat intense, and the silence unbroken  save by the cicalas among the olive-trees. It were therefore the height of  folly to quit this spot at present. Here the air is cool and the prospect  fair, and here, observe, are dice and chess. Take, then, your pleasure as  you may be severally minded; but, if you take my advice, you will find  pastime for the hot hours before us, not in play, in which the loser must  needs be vexed, and neither the winner nor the onlooker much the better  pleased, but in telling of stories, in which the invention of one may afford  solace to all the company of his hearers. You will not each have told a  story before the sun will be low, and the heat abated, so that we shall be  able to go and severally take our pleasure where it may seem best to each.  Wherefore, if my proposal meet with your approval--for in this I am disposed  to consult your pleasure--let us adopt it; if not, divert yourselves as best  you may, until the vesper hour.\"    The queen's proposal being approved by all, ladies and men alike, she  added:--\"So please you, then, I ordain, that, for this first day, we be free  to discourse of such matters as most commend themselves, to each in turn.\"  She then addressed Pamfilo, who sat on her right hand, bidding him with a  gracious air to lead off with one of his stories. And prompt at the word of  command, Pamfilo, while all listened intently, thus began:--    (1) Probably from the name of the pronged or hooked implement with which  they dragged the corpses out of the houses.    (2) Identified by tradition with the Villa Palmieri (now Crawford) on the  slope of Fiesole.

Wherefore, as it  falls to me to lead the way in this your enterprise of story telling, I  intend to begin with one of His wondrous works, that, by hearing thereof,  our hopes in Him, in whom is no change, may be established, and His name be  by us forever lauded. 'Tis manifest that, as things temporal are all doomed  to pass and perish, so within and without they abound with trouble and  anguish and travail, and are subject to infinite perils; nor, save for the  especial grace of God, should we, whose being is bound up with and forms  part of theirs, have either the strength to endure or the wisdom to combat  their adverse influences. By which grace we are visited and penetrated (so  we must believe) not by reason of any merit of our own, but solely out of  the fulness of God's own goodness, and in answer to the prayers of those  who, being mortal like ourselves, did faithfully observe His ordinances  during their lives, and are now become blessed for ever with Him in heaven.  To whom, as to advocates taught by experience all that belongs to our  frailty, we, not daring, perchance, to present our petitions in the presence  of so great a judge, make known our requests for such things as we deem  expedient for us. And of His mercy richly abounding to usward we have  further proof herein, that, no keenness of mortal vision being able in any  degree to penetrate the secret counsels of the Divine mind, it sometimes,  perchance, happens, that, in error of judgment, we make one our advocate  before His Majesty, who is banished from His presence in eternal exile, and  yet He to whom nothing is hidden, having regard rather to the sincerity of  our prayers than to our ignorance or the banishment of the intercessor,  hears us no less than if the intercessor were in truth one of the blest who  enjoy the light of His countenance. Which the story that I am about to  relate may serve to make apparent; apparent, I mean, according to the  standard or the judgment of man, not of God.    The story goes, then, that Musciatto Franzesi, a great and wealthy merchant,  being made a knight in France, and being to attend Charles Sansterre,  brother of the King of France, when he came into Tuscany at the instance and  with the support of Pope Boniface, found his affairs, as often happens to  merchants, to be much involved in divers quarters, and neither easily nor  suddenly to be adjusted; wherefore he determined to place them in the hands  of commissioners, and found no difficulty except as to certain credits given  to some Burgundians, for the recovery of which he doubted whether he could  come by a competent agent; for well he knew that the Burgundians were  violent men and ill-conditioned and faithless; nor could he call to mind any  man so bad that he could with confidence oppose his guile to theirs. After  long pondering the matter, he recollected one Ser Ciapperello da Prato, who  much frequented his house in Paris. Who being short of stature and very  affected, the French who knew not the meaning of Cepparello, (1) but  supposed that it meant the same as Cappello, i. e. garland, in their  vernacular, called him not Cappello, but Ciappelletto by reason of his  diminutive size; and as Ciappelletto he was known everywhere, whereas few  people knew him as Ciapperello. Now Ciappelletto's manner of life was thus.  He was by profession a notary, and his pride was to make false documents; he  would have made them as often as he was asked, and more readily without fee  than another at a great price; few indeed he made that were not false, and,  great was his shame when they were discovered. False witness he bore,  solicited or unsolicited, with boundless delight; and, as oaths were in  those days had in very great respect in France, he, scrupling not to  forswear himself, corruptly carried the day in every case in which he was  summoned faithfully to attest the truth. He took inordinate delight, and  bestirred himself with great zeal, in fomenting ill-feeling, enmities,  dissensions between friends, kinsfolk and all other folk; and the more  calamitous were the consequences the better he was pleased.
