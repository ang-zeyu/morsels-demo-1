Westward and ever westward they sailed,    \"Over the hazy distance, Beyond the sunset's rim\"    Week after week went by.  Six weeks and then seven, and still no  land appeared.  Those were days of anxiety and gloom.  But still the  hope of the golden west lured Cabot on, and at length one day in  June he heard the glad cry of \"Land! Land!\"    So on St.  John's Day, in 1497, John Cabot landed somewhere on the  coast of America.  He called the land Prima Tierra Vista or First  Land Seen, and because of the day upon which it was found he called  an island near to it St.  John's Isle.    We cannot tell exactly where Cabot east anchor: it may have been  at Cape Breton or somewhere on the coast of Labrador.  But wherever  it was that he landed he there set up a great cross and unfurled  the flag of England, claiming the land for King Henry.    When Cabot set out he was full of the ideas of Columbus.  He had hoped  to find himself on the coast of Asia and in the land of gold and  spices.  Now he knew himself mistaken.  He did not see any natives,  but he knew the land was inhabited, for he found notched trees,  snares for wild animals and other signs of habitation which he took  home.    He had found no \"golden cities,\" he had had speech with no stately  potentate.  Yet he was not utterly disappointed.  For the country he  had found seemed to him fair and fertile, and the quantities of  fish which swarmed in the seas amazed both himself and his men.  They  had no need of lines or even of nets.  They had but to let down a  basket weighted with a stone and draw it up again to have all the  fish they wanted.    Cabot stayed but a short time in the new-found land.  He would fain  have stayed longer and explored further, but he feared lest his  provisions would give out, and so regretfully he turned homeward.    Great was the excitement in Bristol when the tiny ship came to anchor  there once more, little more than three months after it had sailed  away.  And so strange were the tales Master Cabot had to tell that  the folk of Bristol would hardly have believed him (for he was a  poor man and a foreigner) had not his crew of honest Bristol men  vouched for the truth of all he said.  Every one was delighted.  Even  thrifty King Henry was so much pleased that he gave Cabot £10.  It  seems a small enough sum for one who had found \"a new isle.\" But  we must remember that it was worth more than £100 would be worth  today.    Cabot at any rate found it enough with which to buy a suit of  silk.  And dressed in this new splendour he walked about the streets  of Bristol followed by gaping crowds.  He was now called the Great  Admiral, and much honour was paid to him.  Every one was eager to  talk with him, eager to go with him on his next voyage: and that  even although they knew that many of the crew would be thieves and  evil-doers.  For the King had promised to give Cabot for sailors  all prisoners except those who were confined for high treason.    We know little more of John Cabot.  Later King Henry gave him a  pension of £20 a year.  It seems likely that the following year he  set out again across the broad Atlantic, taking his sons with him.  \"The rest is silence.\"    How John Cabot ended his life, where he lies taking his rest, we  do not know.    \"He sleeps somewhere in sod unknown, Without a slab, without a  stone.\"    We remember him chiefly because he was the first to lead Englishmen  across the Atlantic, the first to plant the flag of England upon  the Continent of North America, which, in days to come, was to be  the home of two great English speaking peoples.    __________            Chapter 7 - How The Flag of France Was Planted in Florida          As years went on many voyages of discovery and exploration were  made to the New World by both the Spaniards and the Portuguese,  but chiefly by the Spaniards.  America was the land of golden hopes,  the land of splendid adventure, and the haughty knights of Spain,  thirsting for gold and for fame, were lured thither.  They sought  the fabled seven cities of gold, they sought the fountain of eternal  youth.  Through the dark pathless forests, across the wide prairies  they flashed in glittering array, awaking the vast silences with the  clash of arms.  They came in all the pomp and splendour of warfare;  they brought also the Cross of Christ, threatening the heathen with  death if they did not bow to Him and be baptised.  And it seemed for  a time as if they, and they only, would possess the vast continent.  But expedition after expedition ended in disaster.  The Spaniards  found neither the far-famed seven cities nor the fountain of youth.  And the Redmen, instead of accepting their religion, hated them  and it with a deep hatred.    But the Spaniards were not long left in undisputed possession of  America.  The French King too desired to have new lands across the  seas, and he saw no reason why Spain and Portugal should divide  the New World between them.    \"I would fain see Father Adam's will,\" he said, \"in which he made  you the sole heirs to so vast an inheritance.  Until I do see that,  I shall seize as mine whatever my good ships may find upon the ocean. \"    From France, therefore, daring men sailed forth to the New World.  And there they set up the arms of their country, claiming broad  lands for their King.    And now came the time when all Christian lands were torn asunder by  religious strife.  The Reformation had begun, and everywhere there  was discord between the people who followed the old religion and  those who followed the new.  In France those who followed the new  religion were called Huguenots.  They were often hardly used, and  were denied freedom to worship God in their own way.  Many of them  therefore longed to get away from France, and go to some new country  where they would have the freedom they desired.    So a few grave, stern men gathered together and determined to set  out for some place in the New World where they might make a home.    Then one February day in 1562 two little ships sailed away from  France.  Westward they sailed until about two and a half months  later they landed in what is now Florida.    It was May Day, the sun shone and all the world seemed gay and  green, and these Protestant adventurers thought they had never  seen so fair a land.  It was, they said, the fairest, fruitfullest  and pleasantest of all the world, \"abounding in honey, venison  and wildfowl.\" The natives were friendly and told the newcomers by  signs that the seven golden cities were not far off.  That rejoiced  their hearts, for even those stern old Huguenots were not above  following the quest for gold.    Here then in this far-off land the Huguenots set up a stone pillar  carved with the arms of the King of France.  And kneeling round  it they gave thanks to God for having brought them to so fair a  country.  Then returning to their ships they sailed northward along  the coast, For they had not come to settle, but merely to explore,  and find out a good spot on which to found a colony.    But the land seemed so fair, the air so balmy, that they were ready  to settle there at once, and never return to France.    At length after inspecting several places the adventurers reached  a spot not far from what is now Beaufort in South Carolina.  Here  they landed, and knowing that many of the men were already eager  to remain in this beautiful country, Jean Ribaut, their leader,  resolved to found a colony.  So he called them all together, and  speaking wise and brave words to them asked who among them would  remain.    \"Declare your minds freely unto me,\" he said, \"and remember that  if you decide to remain you will for ever be famous, and be known  as the first white men who inhabited this land.\"    Ribaut had scarcely finished speaking when nearly all the men  replied with a shout, \"We ask nothing better than to remain in this  beautiful country.\"    Indeed so many were anxious to remain that Ribaut had enough to  do to persuade a sufficient number to man the ships to return with  him.    In the end thirty men were chosen to remain.  At once they set about  building a fort which they called Charlesfort in honour of the boy  King, Charles IX, who was then upon the throne.    The men worked so well that in a very few days the fort was so  far finished that it was fit to live in.  Food and ammunition were  brought from the ships, and a man named Albert de la Pierria was  chosen as Governor.  Then for the last time Ribaut gathered all the  men together and took leave of those to be left behind.    \"Captain Albert,\" he said, \"I have to ask you in the presence of  all these men, to quit yourself so wisely in your charge, that I  shall be able to commend you to your King.    \"And you,\" he said, turning to the soldiers, \"I beg you to esteem  Captain Albert as if he were myself, and to yield to him that  obedience that a true soldier owes to his general and captain.  I  pray you live as brethren together without discord.  And in so doing  God will assist you, and bless your enterprises.\"    Then farewells were said, and Ribaut sailed away, leaving the thirty  white men alone in the wilderness.    From north to south, from east to west, in all the vast continent  there were no white men save themselves.  The little company was  made up of young nobles, sailors, merchants and artisans.  There  were no farmers or peasants among them, and when they had finished  their fort none of them thought of clearing the land and sowing  corn.  There was no need: Ribaut would soon return, they thought,  bringing with him all they required.  So they made friends with  the Indians, and roamed the forest wilds in search of gold and of  adventures, without care for the future.    But the days and weeks passed and Ribaut did not return.  For when  he arrived home he found that France was torn with civil war, and  that it was impossible to get ships fitted out to sail "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37742"],[0,"Fishes of the Big Blue River Basin, Kansas (#8)"],[1,"combination was  first recorded by Hubbs and Ortenburger (1929:42).    Hubbs and Bailey (1952:144) recorded another hybrid combination from  my area of study: _Campostoma anomalum plumbeum_ x _Chrosomus  erythrogaster_, UMMZ 103132, from a \"spring-fed creek on 'Doc'  Wagner's farm, Riley County, Kansas; September 21, 1927; L. O. Nolf  [collector].\"          RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AND DISCUSSION OF SPECIES      The relative abundance of different species was estimated by  combining counts of individual fishes taken in 290 seine-hauls, 26  hours and 15 minutes of shocking, and seven samples obtained with  rotenone. At some stations all seine-hauls were counted. At other  stations the seine-hauls in which complete counts were recorded had  been selected randomly in advance; that is to say, prior to  collecting at each station. I selected those hauls to be counted  from a table of random numbers (Snedecor, 1956:10-13). I did not use  the frequency-of-occurrence method as proposed by Starrett  (1950:114), in which the species taken and not the total number of  individuals are recorded for all seine-hauls. However, the frequency  of occurrence of each species is indicated by the number of stations  at which it was found, and those stations are listed in the previous  accounts. Table 3 shows the percentage of the total number of fish  that each species comprised in three kinds of streams: sandy (Big  Blue and Little Blue rivers), muddy, and gravelly streams.    The habitat preferences of some species affect their abundance in  different stream-types. _Notropis lutrensis_ and _P. mirabilis_  seemed almost ubiquitous. _Notropis deliciosus_ also occurred in all  kinds of streams (rarely in muddy streams); however, this species  was represented by the sand-loving _N. d. missuriensis_ in the Big  Blue and Little Blue rivers, and _N. d. deliciosus_ in the clear,  gravelly, upland creeks (Nelson, personal communication). Because of  its widespread occurrence, and for purposes of later discussion, I  refer to this minnow also as an ubiquitous species in the Big Blue  River Basin.    _Carpiodes carpio_, _Cyprinus carpio_, _I. punctatus_, _I. melas_,  and _L. humilis_ were widespread, but each was absent or rare in  one of the kinds of streams (Table 3). _Carpiodes carpio_, _Cyprinus  carpio_, and _I. punctatus_ occurred most frequently in the sandy  streams, whereas _L. humilis_ was most common in muddy streams. The  high per cent of _I. melas_ in collections from the Big Blue River  is a direct result of one large population that was taken with  rotenone in a borrow-pit at Station 6-S. In my opinion, this species  actually was most abundant in the muddy streams.       TABLE 3. RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF FISHES IN PER CENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER     TAKEN, BIG BLUE RIVER BASIN, KANSAS. TRACE (TR.) IS USED FOR VALUES     LESS THAN .05 PER CENT, AND DASHES SIGNIFY THAT THE SPECIES DID NOT     OCCUR IN THE COUNTED COLLECTIONS ALTHOUGH IT MAY HAVE OCCURRED IN     UNCOUNTED COLLECTIONS FROM THE SAME STREAM-TYPE. THREE SPECIES,     _C. AURATUS_, _N. BUCHANANI_, AND _S.

Other species that were taken only in the larger  rivers, and that are sometimes associated with streams even larger  (or more sandy) than the Big Blue River are _H. storeriana_, _L.  platostomus_, _M. salmoides_, _P. nigromaculatus_, _C. forbesi_, _S.  platorynchus_, _F. kansae_, _N. buchanani_, _S. canadense_, and _C.  auratus_. _Ictiobus cyprinella_ also occurred more frequently in the  larger streams.    The muddy-bottomed streams supported populations composed primarily  of _P. promelas_, _N. lutrensis_, and _S. atromaculatus_. No  species was restricted to this habitat, but the following were  characteristic there: _P. promelas_, _S. atromaculatus_, _L.  humilis_, _L. cyanellus_, and _I. natalis_. _Carpiodes carpio_,  _Cyprinus carpio_, _C. anomalum_, _E. spectabile_, and _E. nigrum_  were locally common in muddy streams, but the first two were most  frequent in larger, sandy streams, and the last three in gravelly  streams.    In gravel-bottomed, upland streams, _N. cornutus_, _N. rubellus_,  _N. topeka_, and _C. erythrogaster_ characteristically occurred;  with the exception of _N. rubellus_ (only one specimen taken), all  were common at some stations. Other species in gravelly creeks were  _N. lutrensis_, _C. anomalum_, _C. commersonnii_, _P. notatus_, _L.  macrochirus_, _E. spectabile_, and _E. nigrum_. Although the one  specimen of _N. umbratilis_ taken in this survey was from the Big  Blue River, this species is more characteristic of the clearer  creeks in Kansas.    In order to illustrate the composition of the fauna in some specific  streams in the Big Blue River Basin, I segregated the fishes into  ecological groups, as in the above discussion: ubiquitous types;  species of larger, sandy streams; fishes of muddy streams; and  fishes of clear, gravelly creeks.    The total number of species taken in each of the streams was  divided into the number of species from that stream that were in  each of these units, to give a percentage. The resultant data are  presented graphically in Figure 3.       [Illustration: FIG. 3. Composition of the fauna of the entire         Big Blue River Basin, and of seven streams or stream systems         in that basin. \"Mill Creek, Wash. Co.\" refers to all streams         in the Mill Creek System, Washington and Republic counties.         \"Bl. Vermillion R. System\" includes all streams in that         watershed excepting Clear Creek and one of its tributaries         (Stations 31-G and 32-G).]       [Illustration: FIG. 4.

Lowermost sites are at the left of the         figure.]    Figure 3 gives a generalized picture of the faunal composition in  different kinds of streams. However, the fauna of a small tributary  becomes more distinct from the fauna of the larger stream into which  the small stream flows as one moves toward the headwaters (Metcalf,  1957:92, 95-100). Figure 4 illustrates this in Carnahan Creek.  Station 11-G included four sampling-sites, which were approximately  one, two, three, and four miles upstream from the mouth of Carnahan  Creek. Station 13-G (one collection) was about four miles upstream  from the closest sampling-site of Station 11-G. Applying the same  methods as for Figure 3, my findings show a gradual decline in the per  cent"]]]
