Ransford, a  bachelor, a well-preserved, active, alert man who was certainly of no  more than middle age and did not look his years, had come to Wrychester  only a few years previously, and had never shown any signs of forsaking  his single state. No one had ever heard him mention his family or  relations; then, suddenly, without warning, he had brought into his  house Mary Bewery, a handsome young woman of nineteen, who was said  to have only just left school, and her brother Richard, then a boy of  sixteen, who had certainly been at a public school of repute and was  entered at the famous Dean's School of Wrychester as soon as he came  to his new home. Dr. Ransford spoke of these two as his wards, without  further explanation; the society of the Close was beginning to want  much more explanation. Who were they--these two young people? Was Dr.  Ransford their uncle, their cousin--what was he to them? In any case,  in the opinion of the elderly ladies who set the tone of society in  Wrychester, Miss Bewery was much too young, and far too pretty, to be  left without a chaperon. But, up to then, no one had dared to say as  much to Dr. Ransford--instead, everybody said it freely behind his back.    Bryce had used eyes and ears in relation to the two young people. He had  been with Ransford a year when they arrived; admitted freely to their  company, he had soon discovered that whatever relationship existed  between them and Ransford, they had none with anybody else--that  they knew of. No letters came for them from uncles, aunts, cousins,  grandfathers, grandmothers. They appeared to have no memories or  reminiscences of relatives, nor of father or mother; there was a curious  atmosphere of isolation about them. They had plenty of talk about what  might be called their present--their recent schooldays, their youthful  experiences, games, pursuits--but none of what, under any circumstances,  could have been a very far-distant past. Bryce's quick and attentive  ears discovered things--for instance that for many years past Ransford  had been in the habit of spending his annual two months' holiday with  these two. Year after year--at any rate since the boy's tenth year--he  had taken them travelling; Bryce heard scraps of reminiscences of tours  in France, and in Switzerland, and in Ireland, and in Scotland--even as  far afield as the far north of Norway. It was easy to see that both boy  and girl had a mighty veneration for Ransford; just as easy to see that  Ransford took infinite pains to make life something more than happy and  comfortable for both. And Bryce, who was one of those men who  firmly believe that no man ever does anything for nothing and that  self-interest is the mainspring of Life, asked himself over and over  again the question which agitated the ladies of the Close: Who are  these two, and what is the bond between them and this sort of  fairy-godfather-guardian?    And now, as he put away the scrap of paper in a safely-locked desk,  Bryce asked himself another question: Had the events of that morning  anything to do with the mystery which hung around Dr. Ransford's wards?  If it had, then all the more reason why he should solve it. For Bryce  had made up his mind that, by hook or by crook, he would marry Mary  Bewery, and he was only too eager to lay hands on anything that would  help him to achieve that ambition. If he could only get Ransford into  his power--if he could get Mary Bewery herself into his power--well and  good. Once he had got her, he would be good enough to her--in his way.    Having nothing to do, Bryce went out after a while and strolled round to  the Wrychester Club--an exclusive institution, the members of which  were drawn from the leisured, the professional, the clerical, and the  military circles of the old city. And there, as he expected, he found  small groups discussing the morning's tragedy, and he joined one of  them, in which was Sackville Bonham, his presumptive rival, who was  busily telling three or four other young men what his stepfather, Mr.  Folliot, had to say about the event.    \"My stepfather says--and I tell you he saw the man,\" said Sackville, who  was noted in Wrychester circles as a loquacious and forward youth; \"he  says that whatever happened must have happened as soon as ever the old  chap got up into that clerestory gallery. Look here!--it's like this.  My stepfather had gone in there for the morning service--strict old  church-goer he is, you know--and he saw this stranger going up the  stairway. He's positive, Mr. Folliot, that it was then five minutes to  ten. Now, then, I ask you--isn't he right, my stepfather, when he says  that it must have happened at once--immediately?    \"Because that man, Varner, the mason, says he saw the man fall before  ten. What?\"    One of the group nodded at Bryce.    \"I should think Bryce knows what time it happened as well as anybody,\"  he said. \"You were first on the spot, Bryce, weren't you?\"    \"After Varner,\" answered Bryce laconically. \"As to the time--I could fix  it in this way--the organist was just beginning a voluntary or something  of the sort.\"    \"That means ten o'clock--to the minute--when he was found!\" exclaimed  Sackville triumphantly. \"Of course, he'd fallen a minute or two before  that--which proves Mr. Folliot to be right. Now what does that prove?  Why, that the old chap's assailant, whoever he was, dogged him along  that gallery as soon as he entered, seized him when he got to the open  doorway, and flung him through! Clear as--as noonday!\"    One of the group, a rather older man than the rest, who was leaning  back in a tilted chair, hands in pockets, watching Sackville Bonham  smilingly, shook his head and laughed a little.    \"You're taking something for granted, Sackie, my son!\" he said. \"You're  adopting the mason's tale as true. But I don't believe the poor man was  thrown through that doorway at all--not I!\"    Bryce turned sharply on this speaker--young Archdale, a member of a  well-known firm of architects.    \"You don't?\" he exclaimed. \"But Varner says he saw him thrown!\"    \"Very likely,\" answered Archdale. \"But it would all happen so quickly  that Varner might easily be mistaken. I'm speaking of something I know.  I know every inch of the Cathedral fabric--ought to, as we're always  going over it, professionally. Just at that doorway, at the head of St.  Wrytha's Stair, the flooring of the clerestory gallery is worn so smooth  that it's like a piece of glass--and it slopes! Slopes at a very steep  angle, too, to the doorway itself. A stranger walking along there might  easily slip, and if the door was open, as it was, he'd be shot out and  into space before he knew what was happening.\"    This theory produced a moment's silence--broken at last by Sackville  Bonham.    \"Varner says he saw--saw!--a man's hand, a gentleman's hand,\" insisted  Sackville. \"He saw a white shirt cuff, a bit of the sleeve of a coat.  You're not going to get over that, you know. He's certain of it!\"    \"Varner may be as certain of it as he likes,\" answered Archdale, almost  indifferently, \"and still he may be mistaken. The probability is that  Varner was confused by what he saw. He may have had a white shirt cuff  and the sleeve of a black coat impressed upon him, as in a flash--and  they were probably those of the man who was killed. If, as I suggest,  the man slipped, and was shot out of that open doorway, he would execute  some violent and curious movements in the effort to save himself in  which his arms would play an important part. For one thing, he would  certainly throw out an arm--to clutch at anything. That's what Varner  most probably saw. There's no evidence whatever that the man was flung  down.\"    Bryce turned away from the group of talkers to think over Archdale's  suggestion. If that suggestion had a basis of fact, it destroyed his own  theory that Ransford was responsible for the stranger's death. In  that case, what was the reason of Ransford's unmistakable agitation  on leaving the west porch, and of his attack--equally unmistakable--of  nerves in the surgery? But what Archdale had said made him inquisitive,  and after he had treated himself--in celebration of his freedom--to an  unusually good lunch at the Club, he went round to the Cathedral to make  a personal inspection of the gallery in the clerestory.    There was a stairway to that gallery in the corner of the south  transept, and Bryce made straight for it--only to find a policeman  there, who pointed to a placard on the turret door. \"Closed, doctor--by  order of the Dean and Chapter,\" he announced. \"Till further orders. The  fact was, sir,\" he went on confidentially, \"after the news got out, so  many people came crowding in here and up to that gallery that the Dean  ordered all the entrances to be shut up at once--nobody's been allowed  up since noon.\"    \"I suppose you haven't heard anything of any strange person being seen  lurking about up there this morning?\" asked Bryce.    \"No, sir. But I've had a bit of a talk with some of the vergers,\"  replied the policeman, \"and they say it's a most extraordinary thing  that none of them ever saw this strange gentleman go up there, nor even  heard any scuffle. They say--the vergers--that they were all about at  the time, getting ready for the morning service, and they neither saw  nor heard. Odd, sir, ain't it?\"    \"The whole thing's odd,\" agreed Bryce, and left the Cathedral. He walked  round to the wicket gate which admitted to that side of Paradise--to  find another policeman posted there. \"What!--is this closed, too?\" he  asked.    \"And time, sir,\" said the man. \"They'd ha' broken down all the shrubs  in the place if orders hadn't been given! They were mad to see where the  gentleman fell--came in crowds at dinnertime.\"    Bryce nodded, and was turning away, when Dick Bewery came"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#8)"],[1,"was pleasant and clean (fairly so). I took my suit case up  with me and had a hot bath. As I fell asleep I heard a shrill voice  ascending from below, punctuated with masculine laughter. The  Pilgrim was making more converts!        CHAPTER SIX      I had a curious feeling of bewilderment when I woke the next  morning. The bare room with the red-and-blue rag carpet and green  china toilet set was utterly strange. In the hall outside I heard a  clock strike. \"Heavens!\" I thought, \"I've overslept myself nearly  two hours. What on earth will Andrew do for breakfast?\" And then  as I ran to close the window I saw the blue Parnassus with its  startling red letters standing in the yard. Instantly I remembered.  And discreetly peeping from behind the window shade I saw that the  Professor, armed with a tin of paint, was blotting out his own name  on the side of the van, evidently intending to substitute mine. That  was something I had not thought of. However, I might as well make  the best of it.    I dressed promptly, repacked my bag, and hurried downstairs for  breakfast. The long table was nearly empty, but one or two men  sitting at the other end eyed me curiously. Through the window I  could see my name in large, red letters, growing on the side of the  van, as the Professor diligently wielded his brush. And when I had  finished my coffee and beans and bacon I noticed with some amusement  that the Professor had painted out the line about Shakespeare,  Charles Lamb, and so on, and had substituted new lettering. The  sign now read:                            H. MCGILL'S                      TRAVELLING PARNASSUS                       GOOD BOOKS FOR SALE                     COOK BOOKS A SPECIALTY                         INQUIRE WITHIN    Evidently he distrusted my familiarity with the classics.    I paid my bill at the desk, and was careful also to pay the charge  for putting up the horse and van overnight. Then I strolled into the  stable yard, where I found Mr. Mifflin regarding his handiwork with  satisfaction. He had freshened up all the red lettering, which shone  brilliantly in the morning sunlight.    \"Good-morning,\" I said.    He returned it.    \"There!\" he cried--\"Parnassus is really yours! All the world lies  before you! And I've got some more money for you. I sold some books  last night. I persuaded the hotel keeper to buy several volumes of  O. Henry for his smoking-room shelf, and I sold the 'Waldorf Cook  Book' to the cook. My! wasn't her coffee awful? I hope the cook book  will better it.\"    He handed me two limp bills and a handful of small change. I took it  gravely and put it in my purse. This was really not bad--more than  ten dollars in less than twenty-four hours.    \"Parnassus seems to be a gold mine,\" I said.    \"Which way do you think you'll go?\" he asked.    \"Well, as I know you want to get to Port Vigor I might just as well  give you a lift that way,\" I answered.    \"Good! I was hoping you'd say that. They tell me the stage for Port  Vigor doesn't leave till noon, and I think it would kill me to hang  around here all morning with no books to sell. Once I get on the  train I'll be all right.\"    Bock was tied up in a corner of the yard, under the side door of the  hotel. I went over to release him while the Professor was putting  Peg into harness. As I stooped to unfasten the chain from his collar  I heard some one talking through the telephone. The hotel lobby was  just over my head, and the window was open.    \"What did you say?\"    \"---- ---- ---- ----\"    \"McGill? Yes, sir, registered here last night. She's here now.\"    I didn't wait to hear more. Unfastening Bock, I hurried to tell  Mifflin. His eyes sparkled.    \"The Sage is evidently on our spoor,\" he chuckled. \"Well, let's be  off. I don't see what he can do even if he overhauls us.\"    The clerk was calling me from the window: \"Miss McGill, your  brother's on the wire and asks to speak to you.\"    \"Tell him I'm busy,\" I retorted, and climbed onto the seat. It was  not a diplomatic reply, I'm afraid, but I was too exhilarated by  the keen morning and the spirit of adventure to stop to think of a  better answer. Mifflin clucked to Peg, and off we went.    The road from Shelby to Port Vigor runs across the broad hill slopes  that trend toward the Sound; and below, on our left, the river lay  glittering in the valley. It was a perfect landscape: the woods  were all bronze and gold; the clouds were snowy white and seemed  like heavenly washing hung out to air; the sun was warm and swam  gloriously in an arch of superb blue. My heart was uplifted indeed.  For the first time, I think, I knew how Andrew feels on those  vagabond trips of his. Why had all this been hidden from me before?  Why had the transcendent mystery of baking bread blinded me so long  to the mysteries of sun and sky and wind in the trees? We passed a  white farmhouse close to the road. By the gate sat the farmer on a  log, whittling a stick and smoking his pipe. Through the kitchen  window I could see a woman blacking the stove. I wanted to cry out:  \"Oh, silly woman! Leave your stove, your pots and pans and chores,  even if only for one day! Come out and see the sun in the sky and  the river in the distance!\" The farmer looked blankly at Parnassus  as we passed, and then I remembered my mission as a distributor  of literature. Mifflin was sitting with one foot on his bulging  portmanteau, watching the tree tops rocking in the cool wind. He  seemed to be far away in a morning muse. I threw down the reins and  accosted the farmer.    \"Good-morning, friend.\"    \"Morning to you, ma'am,\" he said firmly.    \"I'm selling books,\" I said. \"I wonder if there isn't something you  need?\"    \"Thanks, lady,\" he said, \"but I bought a mort o' books last year an'  I don't believe I'll ever read 'em this side Jordan. A whole set o'  'Funereal Orations' what an agent left on me at a dollar a month. I  could qualify as earnest mourner at any death-bed merrymakin' now, I  reckon.\"    \"You need some books to teach you how to live, not how to die,\" I  said. \"How about your wife--wouldn't she enjoy a good book? How  about some fairy tales for the children?\"    \"Bless me,\" he said, \"I ain't got a wife. I never was a daring man,  and I guess I'll confine my melancholy pleasures to them funereal  orators for some time yet.\"    \"Well, now, hold on a minute!\" I exclaimed. \"I've got just the thing  for you.\" I had been looking over the shelves with some care, and  remembered seeing a copy of \"Reveries of a Bachelor.\" I clambered  down, raised the flap of the van (it gave me quite a thrill to do it  myself for the first time), and hunted out the book. I looked inside  the cover and saw the letters _n m_ in Mifflin's neat hand.    \"Here you are,\" I said. \"I'll sell you that for thirty cents.\"    \"Thank you kindly, ma'am,\" he said courteously. \"But honestly I  wouldn't know what to do with it. I am working through a government  report on scabworm and fungus, and I sandwich in a little of them  funereal speeches with it, and honestly that's about all the readin'  I figure on. That an' the Port Vigor Clarion.\"    I saw that he really meant it, so I climbed back on the seat. I  would have liked to talk to the woman in the kitchen who was peering  out of the window in amazement, but I decided it would be better to  jog on and not waste time. The farmer and I exchanged friendly  salutes, and Parnassus rumbled on.    The morning was so lovely that I did not feel talkative, and as the  Professor seemed pensive I said nothing. But as Peg plodded slowly  up a gentle slope he suddenly pulled a book out of his pocket and  began to read aloud. I was watching the river, and did not turn  round, but listened carefully:      \"Rolling cloud, volleying wind, and wheeling sun--the blue  tabernacle of sky, the circle of the seasons, the sparkling  multitude of the stars--all these are surely part of one rhythmic,  mystic whole. Everywhere, as we go about our small business, we  must discern the fingerprints of the gigantic plan, the orderly and  inexorable routine with neither beginning nor end, in which death  is but a preface to another birth, and birth the certain forerunner  of another death. We human beings are as powerless to conceive the  motive or the moral of it all as the dog is powerless to understand  the reasoning in his master's mind. He sees the master's acts,  benevolent or malevolent, and wags his tail. But the master's acts  are always inscrutable to him. And so with us.    \"And therefore, brethren, let us take the road with a light heart.  Let us praise the bronze of the leaves and the crash of the surf  while we have eyes to see and ears to hear. An honest amazement at  the unspeakable beauties of the world is a comely posture for the  scholar. Let us all be scholars under Mother Nature's eye.      \"How do you like that?\" he asked.    \"A little heavy, but very good,\" I said. \"There's nothing in it  about the transcendent mystery of baking bread!\"    He looked rather blank.    \"Do you know who wrote it?\" he asked.    I made a valiant effort to summon some of my governessly  recollections of literature.    \"I give it up,\" I said feebly. \"Is it Carlyle?\"    \"That is by Andrew McGill,\" he said. \"One of his cosmic passages  which are now beginning to be reprinted in schoolbooks. The blighter  writes well.\"    I began to be uneasy lest I should be put through a literary  catechism, so I said nothing, but roused Peg into an amble. To tell  the truth I was more curious to hear the Professor talk about his  own book than about Andrew's. I had always carefully refrained from  reading Andrew's stuff, as I thought it rather dull.    \"As for me,\" said the Professor, \"I have no facility at the grand  style. I have always suffered from the feeling that it's better to  read a good book than to write a poor one; and I've done so much  mixed reading in my time that my mind is full of echoes and voices  of better "]]]
