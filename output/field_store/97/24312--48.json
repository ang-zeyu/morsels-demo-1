The males differ in character, but they are mostly uncertain in temper  during a period varying from two to four months every year. At such  occurrences of disturbance the animal requires careful treatment, and  the chains which shackle the fore legs should be of undoubted quality.  Some elephants remain passive throughout the year, while others appear  to be thoroughly demented, and, although at other seasons harmless,  would, when \"must,\" destroy their own attendant and wreak the direst  mischief. At such a crisis the mahout must always be held responsible  for accidents, as the animal, if properly watched and restrained, would  be incapable of active movements, and would of course be comparatively  harmless. Upon many occasions, through the neglect of the attendant, an  elephant has been left unchained, or perhaps secured with an old chain  that has been nearly worn through a link; the escape of the animal under  such circumstances has led to frightful casualties, usually commencing  with the destruction of the mahout, who may have attempted a recapture.  The approach of the \"must\" period is immediately perceived by a peculiar  exudation of an oily nature from a small duct upon either temple; this  somewhat resembles coal-tar in consistence, and it occupies an area of  about four inches square upon the surface of the skin. There is a  decided odour in this secretion somewhat similar to the same exudation  from the neck of the male camel.    I have known male elephants which were remarkably docile throughout all  seasons, but even these had to be specially regarded during the period  of \"must,\" as there was no means of foretelling a sudden and unexpected  outbreak of temper. Many males are at all times fretful, and these  expend their ill-nature in various ways; if chained, they kick up the  earth, and scatter the dust in all directions; they are never quiet for  one moment throughout the day, but continue to swing their heads to and  fro, and prick forward their ears, exhibiting a restlessness of spirit  that is a sufficient warning to any stranger. Such elephants should  always be approached with caution, and never directly in front, but at  the side.    An elephant is frequently treacherous, and if the person should stand  unheedingly before it, a sudden slap with the trunk might be the  consequence. For the same reason, it would be dangerous to approach the  heels of such an animal, as a kick from an elephant is rather an  extensive movement, and it is extraordinary that so colossal a limb as  the hind leg can be projected with such velocity, equalling that of a  small pony.    Discussions have frequently arisen concerning the maximum speed of an  elephant; this is difficult to decide exactly, as there can be no  question that the animal in a wild state will exert a greater speed than  can be obtained from it when domesticated. The African variety is  decidedly faster than the Asiatic; the legs being longer, the stride is  in proportion; and as the habits of the African lead it to wander over  large tracts of open country instead of confining its rambles to  secluded forests, this peculiarity would naturally render the animal  more active, and tend to accelerate its movements. I consider that the  African elephant is capable of a speed of fifteen miles an hour, which  it could keep up for two or three hundred yards, after which it would  travel at about ten miles an hour, and actually accomplish the distance  within that period. The Asiatic elephant might likewise attain a speed  of fifteen miles for perhaps a couple    of hundred yards, but it would not travel far at a greater pace than  eight miles an hour, and it would reduce that pace to six after the  first five miles.    The proof of an elephant's power of great speed for a short distance is  seldom seen except in cases where the animal is infuriated, and gives  chase to some unfortunate victim, who seldom escapes his fate by flight.  For a short burst of fifty or one hundred yards an elephant might  occasionally attain a pace exceeding fifteen miles an hour, as I have  frequently, when among rough ground, experienced a difficulty in  escaping when on horseback; and in my young days, when a good runner, I  have been almost caught when racing along a level plain as smooth as a  lawn with a savage elephant in full pursuit. An active man upon good  ground can run for a short distance at the rate of eighteen miles an  hour; this should clear him from the attack of most elephants; but  unfortunately the good ground is scarce, and the elephant is generally  discovered in a position peculiarly favourable to itself, where the  roughness of the surface and the tangled herbage render it impossible  for a man to run at full speed without falling.    We have recently seen a distressing example in the death of the lamented  Mr. Ingram in Somaliland, who, although well mounted, was overtaken by  an infuriated wild elephant and killed. This was a female, and it  appears that Mr. Ingram, having followed her on horseback, had fired  repeatedly with a rifle only .450. The animal charged, and owing to the  impediments of the ground, which was covered with prickly aloes, the  horse could not escape, and Mr. Ingram was swept off the saddle and  impaled upon the elephant's tusks.    The African differs from the Asiatic in the formation of ivory, the  tusks of the former being both thicker and heavier; the females also  possess tusks, whereas those of the Asiatic variety have merely embryo  tusks, which do not project more than two or three inches beyond the  lips. I had a tusk of an African elephant that weighed 149 lbs. I have  seen in Khartoum a pair that weighed 300 lbs., and I saw a single tusk  of 172 lbs. In 1874 a tusk was sold at the ivory sale in London that  weighed 188 lbs. These specimens are exceptions to the general rule, as  the average weight in a full-grown African male would be about 140 lbs.  the pair, or 75 lbs. for one tusk and 65 lbs. for the fellow, which is  specially employed for digging.    The African variety is an industrious digger, as it feeds upon the  succulent roots of many trees, especially those of the mimosa family.  The right tusk is generally used in these operations more than the left;  accordingly it is lighter from continual wear, and it is known by the  Arabs as the \"hadam\" or servant. As the African elephant is a root-eater  it is far more destructive than the Asiatic. It is astonishing to  observe the waste of trees that are upturned by a large herd of these  animals, sometimes out of sheer wantonness, during their passage through  a forest. The dense tops of mimosas are a great attraction, and there  can be no doubt that elephants work collectively to dig out and to  overthrow the trees that would be too large for the strength of a single  animal. I have seen trees between two and three feet in diameter that  have been felled for the sake of the roots and tender heads; these have  shown unmistakable signs of an attack by several elephants, as the  ground has been ploughed by tusks of different sizes to tear up the long  straggling roots which were near the surface, and the deep marks of feet  around the centre of operations, of various diameters, have proved the  co-operation of members of the herd.    I once saw an elephant strike a large timber tree with its forehead to  shake down the fruit. This was a peculiar example of the immense power  that can be exerted when required. We were waiting near the margin of  the White Nile, about half an hour before sunset, expecting the arrival  of waterbuck, when a rumbling sound and a suppressed roar in the jungle  were accompanied by the breaking of a branch, which denoted the approach  of elephants. Presently they emerged from the forest in several  directions, and one, which appeared to be the largest I had ever seen,  advanced to within 120 yards of our position without perceiving us, as  we were concealed behind a bush upon some rising ground close to the  river's bank. This elephant had enormous tusks, but as we had only  small-bore rifles, I was contented to watch, without disturbing the  magnificent animal before me.    There was a very large and lofty tree quite three feet in diameter; upon  the upper branches grew the much-loved fruit, similar in appearance to  good-sized dates, and equally sweet and aromatic (Balanites Egyptiaca).  Elephants will travel great distances to arrive at a forest where such  fruit is produced in quantity, and they appear to know the season when  the crop will be thoroughly ripe. Upon this occasion, the elephant,  having picked up the single fruits which lay scattered upon the ground,  presently looked up, and being satisfied with the appearance of the  higher boughs, he determined to shake down a plentiful supply. Retiring  for a few feet, he deliberately rammed his forehead against the stem,  with such force as to shake the tree from top to bottom, causing a most  successful shower of the coveted fruit, which he immediately commenced  to eat.    Commander R. N. J. Baker was my companion, and we agreed that any person  who might have taken refuge in the branches of that large tree must have  held on exceedingly tight to have avoided a fall, so severe was the  concussion.    When it is considered that a large bull elephant weighs between six and  seven tons, which weight is set in movement by the muscular exertion of  the animal, there is at once an explanation of the force against a tree,  which, although large, would hardly exceed that weight.    The memory of elephants must be peculiarly keen, as they remember the  seasons for visiting certain districts where some particular food is  produced in attractive quantities. In the southern district of Ceylon,  between Yalle river and the sea-coast, there are great numbers of the  Bael tree, the fruit of which resembles a large cricket-ball.
