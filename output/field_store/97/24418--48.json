He had moved to the  West, and his house was occupied by strangers.    I now commenced my labors in good earnest. I addressed crowded  audiences almost every day, and the people, who had known me from a  child, seemed astonished--knowing that I had had but little  opportunity of acquiring knowledge by study; and while many were  interested in the truth, some began to be filled with envy, and  with a lying, persecuting spirit. My father, mother, aunt Van Cott,  and many others, believed the truth in part; but my brother Orson,  a youth of nineteen years, received it with all his heart, and was  baptized at that time, and has ever since spent his days in the  ministry.    It was during my labors in these parts, in the autumn of 1830,  that a very singular and extraordinary sign was shown in the  heavens, which I will here describe.    I had been on a visit to a singular people called Shakers, at  New Lebanon, about seven miles from my aunt Van Cott's, and was  returning that distance, on foot, on a beautiful evening of  September. The sky was without a cloud; the stars shone out  beautifully, and all nature seemed reposing in quiet, as I pursued  my solitary way, wrapt in deep meditations on the predictions of  the holy prophets; the signs of the times; the approaching advent  of the Messiah, to reign on the earth, and the important  revelations of the Book of Mormon; my heart filled with gratitude  to God that He had opened the eyes of my understanding to receive  the truth, and with sorrow for the blindness of those who lightly  rejected the same, when my attention was aroused by a sudden  appearance of a brilliant light which shone around me, above the  brightness of the sun. I cast my eyes upward to inquire from whence  the light came, when I perceived a long chain of light extended in  the heavens, very bright, and a deep fiery red. It at first stood  stationary in a horizontal position; at length bending in the  center, the two ends approached each other with a rapid movement,  so as to form an exact square. In this position it again remained  stationary for some tame, perhaps a minute, and then again the ends  approached each other with the same rapidity, and again ceased to  move, remaining stationary, for perhaps a minute, in the form of a  compass; it then commenced a third movement in the same manner, and  closed like the closing of a compass, the whole forming a straight  line like a chain doubled. It again retained stationary for a  minute, and then faded away.    I fell upon my knees in the street, and thanked the Lord for so  marvelous a sign of the coming of the Son of Man.    Some persons may smile at this, and say that all these exact  movements were by chance; but, for my part, I could as soon believe  that the letters of the alphabet would be formed by chance, and be  placed so as to spell my name, as to believe that these signs  (known only to the wise) could be formed and shown forth by chance.    Renewed in spirit and filled with joy I now pursued my way, and  arrived at my aunt Van Cott's, not weary, but refreshed with a long  walk, and deep communion with myself and God.    Having lifted a warning voice to multitudes in all this region  of country, I now took leave, and repaired again to the western  part of New York, and to the body of the Church.    On our arrival, we found that brother Joseph Smith, the  translator of the Book of Mormon, had returned from Pennsylvania to  his father's residence in Manchester, near Palmyra, and there I had  the pleasure of seeing him for the first time.    He received me with a hearty welcome, and with that frank and  kind manner so universal with him in after years.    On Sunday we held meeting at his house; the two large rooms were  filled with attentive listeners, and he invited me to preach. I did  so, and afterwards listened with interest to a discourse from his  own mouth, filled with intelligence and wisdom. We repaired from  the meeting to the water's edge, and, at his request, I baptized  several persons.    President Joseph Smith was in person tall and well built, strong  and active, of a light complexion, light hair, blue eyes, very  little beard, and of an expression peculiar to himself, on which  the eye naturally rested with interest, and was never weary of  beholding. His countenance was ever mild, affable, beaming with  intelligence and benevolence; mingled with a look of interest and  an unconscious smile, or cheerfulness, and entirely free from all  restraint or affectation of gravity; and there was something  connected with the serene and steady penetrating glance of his eye,  as if he would penetrate the deepest abyss of the human heart, gaze  into eternity, penetrate the heavens, and comprehend all worlds.    He possessed a noble boldness and independence of character; his  manner was easy and familiar; his rebuke terrible as the lion; his  benevolence unbounded as the ocean; his intelligence universal, and  his language abounding in original eloquence peculiar to  himself--not polished--not studied--not smoothed and softened by  education and refined by art; but flowing forth in its own native  simplicity, and profusely abounding in variety of subject and  manner. He interested and edified, while, at the same time, he  amused and entertained his audience; and none listened to him that  were ever weary with his discourse. I have even known him to retain  a congregation of willing and anxious listeners for many hours  together, in the midst of cold or sunshine, rain or wind, while  they were laughing at one moment and weeping the next. Even his  most bitter enemies were generally overcome, if he could once get  their ears.    I have known him when chained and surrounded with armed  murderers and assassins who were heaping upon him every possible  insult and abuse, rise up in the majesty of a son of God and rebuke  them, in the name of Jesus Christ, till they quailed before him,  dropped their weapons, and, on their knees, begged his pardon, and  ceased their abuse.    In short, in him the characters of a Daniel and a Cyrus were  wonderfully blended. The gifts, wisdom and devotion of a Daniel  were united with the boldness, courage, temperance, perseverance  and generosity of a Cyrus. And had he been spared a martyr's fate  till mature manhood and age, he was certainly endued with powers  and ability to have revolutionized the world in many respects, and  to have transmitted to posterity a name associated with more  brilliant and glorious acts than has yet fallen to the lot of  mortal. As it is, his works will live to endless ages, and  unnumbered millions yet unborn will mention his name with honor, as  a noble instrument in the hands of God, who, during his short and  youthful career, laid the foundation of that kingdom spoken of by  Daniel, the prophet, which should break in pieces all other  kingdoms and stand forever.    But I will not forestall the reader. I have yet to speak of him  in my history, under many and varying circumstances, in which I  have necessarily been associated with him, up to the latest year of  his life.      CHAPTER VII.  ------------------------    Mission to the Western States:--Visit to the  Indians:--Wonderful Success in Kirtland, Ohio:--Journey  Westward:--Great Excitement and Anxiety to Hear the  Fulness of the Gospel:--Imprisonment:--Mock Trial:--  Escape:--Preaching:--Success:--Visit the Wyandots:--  Journey Resumed:--Great Hardships:--Arrival on the Frontiers  of Missouri.    It was now October, 1830. A revelation had been given through  the mouth of this Prophet, Seer and Translator, in which Elders  Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, Ziba Peterson and myself were  appointed to go into the wilderness, through the western States,  and to the Indian territory. Making arrangements for my wife in the  family of the Whitmers, we took leave of our friends and the church  late in October, and started on foot.    After travelling for some days we called on an Indian nation at  or near Buffalo; and spent part of a day with them, instructing  them in the knowledge of the record of their forefathers. We were  kindly received, and much interest was manifested by them on  hearing this news. We made a present of two copies of the Book of  Mormon to certain of them who could read, and repaired to Buffalo.  Thence we continued our journey, for about two hundred miles, and  at length called on Mr. Rigdon, my former friend and instructor, in  the Reformed Baptists Society. He received us cordially and  entertained us with hospitality.    We soon presented him with a Book of Mormon, and related to him  the history of the same. He was much interested, and promised a  thorough perusal of the book.    We tarried in this region for some time, and devoted our time to  the ministry, and visiting from house to house.    At length Mr. Rigdon and many others became convinced that they  had no authority to minister in the ordinances of God; and that  they had not been legally baptized and ordained. They, therefore,  came forward and were baptized by us, and received the gift of the  Holy Ghost by laying on of hands, and prayer in the name of Jesus  Christ.    The news of our coming was soon noised abroad, and the news of  the discovery of the Book of Mormon and the marvelous events  connected with it. The interest and excitement now became general  in Kirtland, and in all the region round about. The people thronged  us night and day, insomuch that we had no time for rest and  retirement. Meetings were convened in different neighborhoods, and  multitudes came together soliciting our attendance; while thousands  flocked about us daily; some to be taught, some for curiosity, some  to obey the gospel, and some to dispute or resist it.    In two or three weeks from arrival in the neighborhood with the  news, we had baptized one hundred and twenty-seven souls,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/449"],[0,"Pathology of Lying, Accusation, and Swindling: A Study in Forensic Psychology (#8)"],[1,"thinks the case presents some paranoiac features with a  pathological tendency towards lying.  Thus this pathological liar  presents the phenomenon of a mixture of lies and delusions.    From the Zurich clinic of Forel several cases of pathological  swindling have been reported at length.[20]  It must be confessed  that the success of much of the misrepresentation cited in these  case histories seems to be as largely due to the naivete of the  country folk as to the efforts of the swindlers themselves.  Two  of the cases were clearly insane and were detained for long  periods in asylums after their study in the clinic.  But even so,  it is to be noted that one of these when absenting himself from  institutional care succeeded in going on with his swindling  operations.  The third case was regarded as that of an  aberrational individual with special tendency towards lying and  swindling, but the opinion rendered did not end in the man being  held as insane.  He was simply regarded as a delinquent, and  after serving his sentence he went his old way.  These cases are  interesting to one who would learn the extent to which swindling  among a simple minded population can be carried on.      [20] ``Gerichtlich-psychiatrische Gutachten aus d. Klinik von  Prof. Forel in Zurich; f. Aerzte u. Juristen, herausgegeb. von  Dr. Th. Koelle.'' Stuttgart, Encke, 1902.        From French sources we have not been able to collect such a  wealth of material as we found in German literature.  One study  by Belletrud and Mercier[21] compares favorably in elaborate  working out of details with the work of German authors.  A  Corsican boy, from childhood moody, fond of adventure, inclined  to deception, had attempted suicide several times before he was  twenty years old.  He was married at that time and went to  France, where he was employed in several towns.  His life  following this included an immense amount of lying and swindling.  He had a mania for buying costly antique furniture and jewelry  which he obtained on credit.  He frequently disappeared from  localities where he was wanted on criminal charges, and changed  his name.  He wandered through Italy, Tunis, and South America.  Returning to France he was taken into custody and mental troubles  were noted.  He showed delirium of persecution and was removed to  a hospital for the insane.  Experts studied him for a year before  they could decide whether he was insane or merely simulating  insanity.  Finally they thought he was not simulating.  A few  months later he escaped, went to Belgium, Italy, Corsica.  Turning up at a town in France under an assumed name, he was  arrested again and elaborately examined.  At this time he had  frequent attacks of unconsciousness and frothing at the mouth.  At times he was melancholy.  Summarizing the case, the authors  say that the psychic peculiarities of the patient were  congenital, and included habitual instability of character with  defective development of the ethical sentiments, and tendency to  deceit and swindling.  Epilepsy here is, of course, the central  cause of mental and moral deterioration.      [21] ``Un cas de mythomanie; escroquerie et simulation chez un  epileptique.''  L'Encephale, June 1910, p. 677.        From a pedagogical point of view Rouma[22] tells of the marvelous  stories of a five-year-old boy in the Froebel school at  Charleroi.  His stories were generally suggested by something  told by the teacher or other pupils.  He referred their anecdotes  to himself or other members of his family and greatly enlarged  upon them.  He also made elaborate childish drawings and gave  long accounts of what they meant.  Going into the question of  heredity Rouma found this boy's mother very nervous; the father  was a good man.  She had worked steadily at the machine before  his birth.  Two of their children died with convulsions; of the  two living, one was well behaved, but weakly.  Rouma's case had  stigmata of degeneracy in ears, palate, and jaw.  Tested by the  Binet system, he did three out of five of the tests for five  years satisfactorily.  He was easily fatigued, refused at times  to respond, said he had been forbidden to reply, said he would be  whipped if he did.  In school he was always poor at manual work,  wanted to be moving about, to go out of classes on errands, was  always calling notice to himself in a good or bad way.  He paid  very little attention to his lessons, played alone or with  younger children, leading them often into mischief.  It was found  that he got much of his material for stories from his older  brother who told him of robbers and accidents.  From his good  father he got the form of his tales, because the father was wont  to tell him stories with a moral.      [22] ``Un cas de mythomanie.''  Arch. de Psych. 1908, pp.  259-282.        In summary, Rouma stated that this child possessed senses acute  beyond the average, and was of very unstable temperament,  refusing regular work, not submitting to rules, rebelling at  abstractions.  There were evidences of degeneracy on the mother's  side.    Remedies in education for such children are:  Suppress food for  imagination, such as came from the stories of father and brother.  Direct perceptions to accurate work.  Systematize education of  attention, exercise the senses, use manual work, such as modeling  and gardening.  Give lessons in observation in the class room and  on promenades.    Meunier[23] tells of three girls in a well known Parisian school  who indulged in wonderful tales.  The first, in the intermediate  grade, told stories of the illness of her father to account for  her not having her lessons.  The second, 11 years old, said that  her mother was dying; she came bringing this news to the teachers  at two different periods of her school life.  She was a calm,  thoughtful, analytical child with no reason for lying.  Family  history negative.  The third, 13 years old, told of an imaginary  uncle who was going to collect funds for needy children; she kept  up the deceit for two months.  She was an anemic, nervous,  hysterical child with a nervous mother.  Meunier calls these  cases of systematized deliriums.  The development of such  delirium annihilates, so to speak, the entire personality of the  subject, and his entire mental life is invaded by abnormal extra  and introspection--the delirium commands and systematizes all  acquired impressions.  There is a veritable splitting of the  personality in which the new ``ego'' is developed at the expense  of the normal ``ego'' that now only appears at intervals.

CHAPTER III    CASES OF PATHOLOGICAL LYING AND SWINDLING    In the group of twelve cases making up this chapter we have  limited ourselves to a simple type in order to demonstrate most  clearly the classical characteristics of pathological liars.  How  pathological lying verges into swindling may be readily seen in  several of the following cases, e.g., Cases 3, 8, 10, 12,  although only two, Cases 3 and 12, have had time as yet to show  marked development of the swindling tendency.  For the purpose of  aiding in the demonstration of the evolution of lying into  swindling, and also to bring out the fact that facility in  language may be the determining influence towards pathological  lying and swindling, we have included Case 12, which otherwise  possibly might be considered under our head of border-line mental  types.    In any attempt to distinguish between pathological accusers and  liars, cases overlapping into both groups are found--so some of  the material in this chapter may be fairly considered as  belonging partially to the next chapter.    In discussing the possibility of betterment, a fact which we as  well as others have observed, consideration of Cases 1, 4, and 7  is suggested.      CASE 1    Summary:  A girl of 16 applied for help, telling an elaborate  tale of family tragedy which proved to be totally untrue.  It was  so well done that it deceived the most experienced.  Shrewd  detective work cleared the mystery.  It was found that the girl  was a chronic falsifier and had immediately preceding this  episode become delinquent in other ways.  Given firm treatment in  an institution and later by her family, who knew well her  peculiarities, this girl in the course of four years apparently  has lost her previous extreme tendency to falsification.      Hazel M. at 16 years of age created a mild sensation by a story  of woe which brought immediate offers of aid for the alleged  distress.  One morning she appeared at a social center and stated  she had come from a hospital where her brother, a young army man,  had just died.  She gave a remarkably correct, detailed, medical  account of his suffering and death.  In response to inquiry she  told of a year's training as a nurse; that was how she knew about  such subjects.  In company with a social worker she went directly  back to the hospital to make arrangements for what she requested,  namely, a proper burial.  At the hospital office it was said that  no such person had died there, and after she had for a time  insisted on it she finally said she must have been dreaming.  Although she had wept on the shoulder of a listener as she first  told her story, she now gave it up without any show of emotion.  We were asked to study the case.    Hazel sketched to us a well-balanced story of her family life;  one which it was impossible to break down.  It involved  experiences at army posts--she stated her only relatives were  brothers in the army--and her recent work as a ``practical  nurse.''  She finally led on to the death of her brother, as in  the tale previously told.  When asked how she accounted for the  fact that no such person was found in the hospital, she answered,  ``Well, I either must have been crazy or something is the matter,  and I don't think my"]]]
