This cave was 10 feet high at most, but averaged five to six       feet. It harbored about 1,000 birds, most of them nesting back in       the dimly lit zone but one small group of 50 nested in the entrance       in bright light. The adults were still feeding young, although the       latter could fly strongly.    _=Chaetura leucopygialis=_ (Blyth): White-rumped Spine-tailed  Swift.--_Specimens_, 12: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] well-developed  brood patch, June 28, 1962, MCT 2565; [Female], 12.9 gm., June 30, 1962,  MCT 2567; [Female], June 30, 1962, heavy molt on body, head, wing, tail,  MCT 2568; [Female], 14.5 gm., June 30, 1962, MCT 2569; [Female], 13.0  gm., June 30, 1962, MCT 2571; [Female], 13.0 gm., July 1, 1962, MCT  2572; [Male] testis 4 x 2 mm., 12.3 gm., July 1, 1962, MCT 2575; [Male]  testis 2 x 1 mm., 14.9 gm., July 2, 1962, MCT 2576; [Female], 15.4 gm.,  July 5, 1962, MCT 2595; [Male] testis 2 x 1 mm., 15.4 gm., wing molt,  July 5, 1962, MCT 2596; [Male] testis 2 x 1 mm., 11.9 gm., July 6, 1962,  MCT 2598; [Female], 13.0 gm., July 6, 1962, MCT 2599.         This species was common around the Cocoa Research Station but was       not seen elsewhere. There is some variation in color within the       populations.    _=Hemiprocne comata comata=_ (Temminck): White-whiskered Tree  Swift.--_Specimens_, 3: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 2 x 1 mm.,  17.0 gm., July 28, 1962, MCT 2675; sex?, young in juvenal plumage, MCT  2812; [Male], April 28, 1963, ADG 76.         At the Cocoa Research Station this common bird usually was seen       sitting on a dead branch of a shade tree in the cocoa whence it       would dart out after insects. It rarely perched higher than 12       feet. Occasionally it was seen in a clearing in the primary forest.    _=Hemiprocne longipennis longipennis=_ (Rafinesque): Crested Tree  Swift.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 4 x 3 mm.,  September 4, 1962, MCT 2866; sex?, 42.8 gm., September 8, 1962, MCT  2888.         These swifts also were common at the Cocoa Research Station. Unlike       _H. comata_, these birds flew high and sat far up in trees while       resting. I never observed them in the primary forest.         The two specimens were more greenish-blue dorsally than typical _H.       l. longipennis_. Specimens from Java were paler gray ventrally and       their tertials were more nearly white. Too few specimens were       available to permit determination of the constancy of the mentioned       variation and the two from the station are referred to the nominate       subspecies until more material becomes available.    _=Harpactes diardi diardi=_ (Temminck): Diard's Trogon.--_Specimens_, 8:  Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 95.9 gm., July 2, 1962, MCT 2579; 3  alcoholic naked young, July 3, 1962, presumed young of 2579, MCT  2581-83; [Female], 95.0 gm., August 20, 1962, MCT 2782; [Male] testis 6  x 3 mm., September 5, 1962, MCT 2870; [Male], September 5, 1962, MCT  2871; [Male], December 1, 1962, MCT 3409.         This was the most numerous of the trogons at the Cocoa Research       Station. One female was taken in a live trap set for rats in the       cocoa. The next day a laborer found a young, presumably of that       female, in a nest in the same area. On August 20, a flock of 5 to       10 birds was seen moving together in a loose group through the       jungle. This species appeared to be a bird of the primary forest,       but occasionally was found in the cocoa.    _=Harpactes kasumba impavidus=_ (Chasen and Kloss): Red-naped  Trogon.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], 72.1 gm.,  August 5, 1962, MCT 3730 (discarded); [Female], September 7, 1962, MCT  2883.         This species of the deep forest was not seen in any other habitat.    _=Harpactes duvauceli=_ (Temminck): Scarlet-rumped Trogon.--_Specimens_,  7: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 30.9 gm., July 24, 1962, MCT 2648;  [Male]?, December 1, 1962, MCT 3407; [Male], December 1, 1962, MCT 3408.  Ulu Balung: [Female], July 18, 1963, ADG 209; [Male], July 18, 1963,  ADG 208. Kinabatangan Agricultural Station: [Female], October 13, 1963,  ADG 305. 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Female], October 10, 1962, MCT 2996.         This trogon of the primary forest was second in abundance only to       _H. diardi_.    _=Halcyon concreta=_ (Temminck): Chestnut-collared  Kingfisher.--_Specimens_, 2: 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Male], November 8,  1962, MCT 3222; [Female], November 8, 1962, MCT 3223.         This kingfisher was netted near a small stream in the deep primary       forest. Another individual was obtained in moss forest at an       elevation of 4,000 feet at Tenom, but was discarded.    _=Halcyon chloris chloroptera=_ (Oberholser): White-collared  Kingfisher.--_Specimens_, 4: 9.5 mi. E Tawau: [Female] largest ovum 3  mm., 61.7 gm., July 29, 1962, MCT 2683; [Male] testis 5 x 4 mm., 60.3  gm., July 29, 1962, paired with 2683. Telipok: [Female], February 9,  1963, G. R. Conway; [Female], February 10, 1963, G. R. Conway.         This is a bird of the sea coast. It was seen at Tawau, Siamil       Island, and Karindingen Island.    _=Halcyon sancta sancta=_ (Vigors and Horsfield): Sacred  Kingfisher.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], June 17,  1963, ADG 147.         The specimen was taken along the Apas River in scrubland near the       river. One previously was recorded from North Borneo, this from       Labuan (Smythies, 1957:660). He (1963:278) saw another at Bauto on       the Labuk River.    _=Halcyon pileata=_ (Boddaert): Black-capped Kingfisher.--_Specimens_,  3: Tenom: [Male], January 1, 1963, MCT 3564. Pintasan Agriculture  Station: [Female], October 18, 1963, ADG 322; [Male], October 11, 1963,  ADG 301.         The specimen from Tenom was caught in a net in the scrub-grassland       association. The others were taken along the Kinabatangan River.    _=Pelargopsis capensis fraseri=_ Sharpe: Stork-billed  Kingfisher.--_Specimens_, 2: Telipok: [Male], February 9, 1963, TM 30.  Mt. Rumas: [Male], April 16, 1963, ADG 53.         This species was common along the lower reaches of the Kalabakan       and Brantian rivers and in the mangroves near Tawau.    _=Alcedo atthis bengalensis=_ Gmelin: Common Kingfisher.--_Specimen_, 1:  Pintasan Agriculture Station: [Female], October 12, 1963, ADG 304.         I saw this kingfisher once along the Apas River at Quoin Hill and       again along the beach at Siamil Island.    _=Alcedo euryzona euryzona=_ Temminck: Blue-banded  Kingfisher.--_Specimens_, 4: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], September  7, 1962, MCT 2884. 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Male], October 19, 1962, MCT  3091; [Female], October 20, 1962, MCT 3099; [Male], October 20, 1962,  MCT 3101.         This species was fairly common along streams deep in the primary       forest at Quoin Hill.    _=Ceyx erithacus=_ ssp. (Linnaeus): Forest Kingfisher.--_Specimens_, 4:  Cocoa Research Station: [Male], 13.2 gm., September 14, 1962, MCT 2924;  12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Male], October 18, 1962, MCT 3075; [Female],  October 26, 1962, MCT 3163. Oil Palm Research Station: [Male], September  5, 1963, ADG 273.         All specimens taken showed characters intermediate between those of       the subspecies _C. e. motleyi_ and _C. e. rufidorsus_. Voous (1951)       states that, in all the Malaysian region, the greatest number of       hybrids between these two subspecies occurred in Borneo and,       further, that he could find hybrid specimens showing practically       all imaginable character combinations. My specimens also showed       these intermediate tendencies and I am unable at present to       allocate the specimens to subspecies.    _=Merops viridis viridis=_ Linnaeus: Blue-throated  Bee-eater.--_Specimens_, 9: Mt. Rumas: [Male], March 5, 1963, ADG 9;  [Male], March 5, 1963, ADG 10; [Female], March 6, 1963, ADG 20; [Male],  March 7, 1963, ADG 21; [Female], March 7, 1963, ADG 22; [Male], March 7,  1963, ADG 23. Telipok: [Female], March 24, 1963; ADG 39. Pintasan:  [Male], October 22, 1963, ADG 302; [Female], October 12, 1963, ADG 303.         These specimens were all taken in March and October and seem to       support Smythies' (1957:664) idea that they arrive with the       northeast monsoon (October to March) and are absent the rest of the       year.    _=Nyctiornis amicta=_ (Temminck): Red-bearded Bee-eater.--_Specimen_, 1:  Cocoa Research Station: [Male], September 27, 1962, molting, MCT 2970.         The specimen was taken along a stream in the deep primary forest,       where it was sitting on a dead twig overlooking the stream. The       call note was much like that of a scolding squirrel. This was the       only time this species was observed in the Quoin Hill area.    _=Eurystomus orientalis cyanicollis=_ Vieillot: Broad-billed  Roller.--_Specimens_, 4: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 2 x 1  mm., 157.4 gm., heavy molt, July 3, 1962, MCT 2585; [Male] testis 2 x 1  mm., 152.0 gm., heavy molt, July 21, 1962, MCT 2633; [Female], 146.4  gm., heavy molt, July 21, 1962, MCT 2634; [Female], April 29, 1963, ADG  83.         At the Cocoa Research Station this common bird perched in dead       trees in the cocoa. On several evenings in September, an individual       was seen catching insects in flight at dusk, repeatedly returning       to a stump between forays. This continued until it was so dark that       I could barely discern the bird.    _=Berenicornis comatus=_ (Raffles): White-crested Hornbill.--A pair was  seen feeding about 150 feet up in a tree at the Cocoa Research Station.  No other was seen in northern Borneo.    _=Annorrhinus galeritus=_ (Temminck): Bushy-crested Hornbill.--This  hornbill was seen only on October 3, 1962, at the Cocoa Research  Station, when a flock of five flew overhead.    _=Aceros leucocephalus=_ (Vie"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3307"],[0,"The Pagan Tribes of Borneo (#8)"],[1,"ation, and call themselves Malays (Orang Malayu). This  name has usually been accorded them by European authors; but when  so used the name denotes a social, political, and religious status  rather than membership in an ethnic group. With the exception of these  partially civilised \"Malays\" of the coast regions and the imported  elements mentioned above, all the natives of Borneo live under tribal  organisation, their cultures ranging from the extreme simplicity of the  nomadic Punans to a moderately developed barbarism. All these pagan  tribes have often been classed together indiscriminately under the  name Dyaks or Dayaks, though many groups may be clearly distinguished  from one another by differences of culture, belief, and custom,  and peculiarities of their physical and mental constitutions.    The Mohammedan population, being of very heterogeneous ethnic  composition, and having adopted a culture of foreign origin, which  may be better studied in other regions of the earth where the Malay  type and culture is more truly indigenous, seems to us to be of  secondary interest to the anthropologist as compared with the less  cultured pagan tribes. We shall therefore confine our attention to  the less known pagan tribes of the interior; and when we speak of  the people of Borneo in general terms it is to the latter only that  we refer (except where the \"Malays\" are specifically mentioned). Of  these we distinguish six principal groups: (1) Sea Dayaks or Ibans,  (2) the Kayans, (3) Kenyahs, (4) Klemantans, (5) Muruts, (6) Punans.    A census of the population has been made in most of the principal  districts of Sarawak and of Dutch Borneo; but as no census of the  whole country has hitherto been made, it is impossible to state  with any pretence to accuracy the number of the inhabitants of the  island. Basing our estimate on such partial and local enumerations  as have been made, we believe the total population to be about  3,000,000. Of these the Chinese immigrants and their descendants, who  are rapidly increasing in number, probably exceed 100,000. The Malays  and the native converts to Islam, who constitute with the Chinese the  population of the towns and settled villages of the coast districts,  probably number between three and four hundred thousand; the Indian  immigrants are probably not more than 10,000; the Europeans number  perhaps 3000; the rest of the population is made up of the six groups  of barbarians named in the foregoing paragraph.    Any estimate of the numbers of the people of each of these six  divisions is necessarily a very rough one, but it is perhaps worth  while to state our opinion on this question as follows: Klemantans,  rather more than 1,000,000; Kenyahs, about 300,000; Muruts, 250,000;  Sea Dayaks, 200,000; Kayans, 150,000; Punans and other peoples of  similar nomadic habits, 100,000 -- I.E. a total of 2,000,000.    (1) Of all these six peoples the Sea Dayaks have become best known  to Europeans, largely owing to their restless truculent disposition,  and to the fact that they are more numerous in Sarawak than any of  the others. They have spread northwards over Sarawak during the latter  half of the last century, chiefly from the region of the Batang Lupar,  where they are still numerous. They are still spreading northward,  encroaching upon the more peaceful Klemantan tribes. They are  most densely distributed in the lower reaches of the main rivers  of Sarawak, especially the Batang Lupar and Saribas rivers, which  are now exclusively occupied by them; but they are found also in  scattered communities throughout almost all parts of Sarawak, and  even in British North Borneo, and they extend from their centre in  Sarawak into the adjacent regions of Dutch Borneo, which are drained  by the northern tributaries of the Great Kapuas River.    The Sea Dayak is of a well-marked and fairly uniform physical  type. His skin is distinctly darker than that of the other peoples  of the interior, though not quite so dark as that of most of the  true Malays. The hair of his head is more abundant and longer than  that of other peoples. His figure is well proportioned, neat, and  generally somewhat boyish. His expression is bright and mobile, his  lips and teeth are generally distorted and discoloured by the constant  chewing of betel nut. They are a vain, dressy, boastful, excitable,  not to say frivolous people -- cheerful, talkative, sociable, fond  of fun and jokes and lively stories; though given to exaggeration,  their statements can generally be accepted as founded on fact; they  are industrious and energetic, and are great wanderers; to the last  peculiarity they owe the name of Iban, which has been given them by  the Kayans, and which has now been generally adopted even by the Sea  Dayaks themselves.    The good qualities enumerated above render the Iban an agreeable  companion and a useful servant. But there is another side to the  picture: they have little respect for their chiefs, a peculiarity which  renders their social organisation very defective and chaotic; they  are quarrelsome, treacherous, and litigious, and the most inveterate  head-hunters of the country; unlike most of the other peoples, they  will take heads for the sake of the glory the act brings them and for  the enjoyment of the killing; in the pursuit of human victims they  become possessed by a furious excitement that drives them on to acts  of the most heartless treachery and the most brutal ferocity.    All the Sea Dayaks speak one language, with but slight local  diversities of dialect. It is extremely simple, being almost devoid  of inflections, and of very simple grammatical structure, relying  largely on intonation. It is closely allied to Malay.    (2) The Kayans are widely distributed throughout central Borneo, and  are to be found in large villages situated on the middle reaches of  all the principal rivers with the exception of those that run to the  north coast. They occupy in the main a zone dividing the districts  of the lower reaches of the rivers from the central highlands from  which all the rivers flow.    They are a warlike people, but less truculent than the Sea Dayaks,  more staid and conservative and religious, and less sociable. They  do not wantonly enter into quarrels; they respect and obey their  chiefs. They are equally industrious with the Sea Dayaks, and though  somewhat slow and heavy in both mind and body, they are more skilled  in the handicrafts than any of the other peoples. They also speak  one language, which presents even less local diversity than the Sea  Dayak language.    (3) The Kenyahs predominate greatly in the highlands a little north of  the centre of Borneo where all the large rivers have their sources;  but they are found also in widely scattered villages throughout the  Kayan areas. In all respects they show closer affinities with the  Kayans than with the Sea Dayaks; as regards custom and mode of life  they closely resemble the Kayans, with whom they are generally on  friendly terms; but they are easily distinguished from the Kayans by  well-marked differences of bodily and mental characters, as well as  by language. Physically they are without question the finest people  of the country. Their skin-colour is decidedly fairer than that of  Sea Dayaks or Kayans. They are of medium stature, with long backs  and short, muscular, well-rounded limbs; a little stumpy in build,  but of graceful and vigorous bearing. They are perhaps the most  courageous and intelligent of the peoples; pugnacious, but less  quarrelsome than the Sea Dayak; more energetic and excitable than the  Kayan; hospitable and somewhat improvident, sociable and of pleasant  manners; less reserved and of more buoyant temperament than the Kayan;  very loyal and obedient to their chiefs; more truthful and more to be  depended upon under all circumstances than any of the other peoples,  except possibly the Kayans.    The Kenyahs speak a number of dialects of the same language, and  these differ so widely that Kenyahs of widely separated districts  cannot converse freely with one another; but, as with all the peoples,  except the Sea Dayaks, nearly every man has the command of several  dialects as well as of the Kayan language.    (4) The Klemantans. Under this name we group together a number  of tribes which, though in our opinion closely allied, are widely  scattered in all parts of Borneo, and present considerable diversities  of language and custom. In physical and mental characters they show  affinities to the Kenyahs on the one hand and to the Muruts on the  other. They are less bellicose than the peoples mentioned above,  and have suffered much at their hands. They are careful, intelligent,  and sociable, though somewhat timid, people; skilful in handicrafts,  but less energetic than the Kayans and Kenyahs, and inferior to them  in metal work and the making of swords and spears and boats. The  blow-pipe is their characteristic weapon, and they are more devoted  to hunting than any others, except the Punans.    Klemantans are to be found in every part of the island, but most of  their villages are situated on the lower reaches of the rivers. They  are most abundant in the south, constituting the greater part of the  population of Dutch Borneo; in the north they are few, their place  being filled by their near relatives, the Muruts. The latter constitute  the principal part of the population of the northern end of the island,  predominating over all the other peoples in British North Borneo,  and in the northern extremities of Sarawak and of Dutch Borneo.    (5) The Muruts are confined to the northern part of Borneo. They  resemble the Klemantans more closely than the other peoples. They  are comparatively tall and slender, have less regular and pleasing  features than the Klemantans, and their skin is generally darker  and more ruddy in colour. Their agriculture is superior to that  of the other"]]]
