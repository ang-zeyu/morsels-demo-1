The smallest juvenile (MCZ  49793) from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, has a body length of 162 mm., a  tail length of 46 mm. and a total length of 208 mm.    The dorsal ground-color is pale brown or white; black or dark brown  stripes are present dorsally and laterally. Normally ten stripes are  present at mid-body; the first pair on the first row of dorsal scales;  the second pair on the upper half of 2nd and lower part of 3rd rows;  the third pair on 4th row; the fourth pair on 7th and sometimes part  of 8th rows; the fifth pair (paravertebral stripes) on the 9th row.  Posterior to the place of reduction from 19 to 17 rows by the fusion  of the 3rd and 4th rows, the third, fourth and fifth pairs of stripes  are displaced downward one row. Sometimes the second and third pairs  of stripes are fused resulting in only eight stripes at mid-body. On  some specimens the fourth and fifth pairs of stripes are close  together, but in none are they fused so as to result in a pattern of  six stripes at mid-body.    The paravertebral stripes begin anteriorly on the nape or at any point  on the anterior one-third of the body and continue as discrete stripes  onto the base of the tail. Anteriorly these stripes are always broken  into a series of dashes; posteriorly the stripes are continuous. In  specimens in which the paravertebral stripes do not begin on the  anterior-most part of the body, there is no paravertebral pigmentation  anteriorly.    In addition to the paravertebrals, the other dorsal dark stripes are  variable. In some specimens the stripes are present anteriorly and  gradually disappear near mid-body (the first dark stripe only on three  specimens). In other specimens the stripes are present anteriorly as  dashes and become continuous at mid-body; in others the stripes are  continuous throughout. Posteriorly continuous stripes are of uniform  width; anteriorly sometimes they are wide on the tip of each scale and  narrow on the base (fig. 1, F). The variation in continuity and width  described above is found in all of the dorsal dark stripes.    The ventrals usually have more or less conspicuous dark spots  laterally; in some specimens there are no spots. Except for the dark  lateral spots, when present, the ventrals are immaculate white.  Usually the dorsal ground-color is a pale tan, especially between the  first and second, and the third and fourth dark stripes. The areas  between the second and third dark stripes and across the dorsum  between the fourth stripes on each side are pale brown. In some  specimens the dorsum between the paravertebral stripes is still paler  brown.    Never is more than the lower third of the supralabials brown. Many  specimens have little brown, and others none. In most of those  specimens having brown on the supralabials, the chin and infralabials  are dusky tan or gray. There is little or no brown on the supralabials  or the chin in the northern part of the range (Chiapas), whereas the  greatest amount of brown on the labials and chin is found on some  specimens from the southern part of the range (Honduras). Since there  is considerable variation in the amount of brown on the chin and  labials of specimens from single localities, the slight geographic  trend in this character seemingly is not significant.    In juveniles six black or dark brown stripes boldly contrast with a  white or pale tan ground-color. At mid-body the first pair of dark  stripes is on the 1st scale row; the second pair on the 3rd and 4th  rows; the third pair on the 7th, 8th and at least the lower half of  the 9th rows (fig. 3, B). Ontogenetic change in coloration consists of  the splitting of the second and third pairs of dark stripes in the  juvenile. The first stripe does not split. Consequently adults have  ten dark stripes.    In life an adult from Tonala, Chiapas, had black stripes. The  ground-color below the second stripe, and between the third and fourth  dark stripes was tan. The area between the second and third dark  stripes was reddish-brown, as was the dorsum between the fourth pair  of dark stripes, except that the 10th scale-row was paler.    Three excellent photographs of this species have been published under  the name _Conophis lineatus_ (Ditmars, 1931:pls. 26 and 27).    _Remarks._--Smith (1941:121-122) described _C. pulcher plagosus_ from  Tonala, Chiapas, and characterized the subspecies by its having \"(1)  the ventrals completely unspotted; (2) secondary lines on  paravertebral rows not continuous posteriorly; (3) all other lines on  body also somewhat spotted in appearance; (4) dusky markings on chin  and supralabial border very dim (less distinct than in _p. pulcher_ or  any member of the _lineatus_ series).\" Although all Chiapan specimens  lack ventral spots, specimens from Guatemala have no spots, small  spots, or large spots. Even in specimens from Tegucigalpa, Honduras,  the southernmost limit of the range, the spotting varies from a few  inconspicuous spots to many large spots. Paravertebral rows were  continuous posteriorly in all specimens examined by me. Likewise, all  other stripes were continuous bands of uniform width posteriorly,  having appeared anteriorly as rows of spots or dashes. The amount of  brown on the chin and labials has been shown previously not to be  geographically significant. The absence of characters of adequate  significance to separate populations precludes the naming of  subspecies in this species.    Mertens (1952a:93, and 1952b:61-62) designated three specimens from El  Salvador as _C. pulcher plagosus_. In the latter paper, Mertens, on  the basis of a description of a specimen of \"_C. lineatus_\" from  Divisadero, El Salvador, given by Schmidt (1928:200), referred that  specimen also to _C. pulcher plagosus_. I have examined this specimen  and refer it to _C. lineatus dunni_. Although I have not seen Merten's  specimens, on the basis of the excellent descriptions given by Mertens  (1952b:61-62), I refer the three Salvadoranean specimens to _C.  lineatus dunni_.    The presence of paravertebral stripes in combination with the  characteristics of the genus distinguish _Conophis pulcher_ from all  other snakes in southern Mexico and Central America. The only  sympatric species of this genus, _C. lineatus dunni_, differs in that  it lacks paravertebral stripes, although it may have a single  vertebral stripe. _Conophis lineatus dunni_ has lateral dark stripes  that are present on the 3rd and 4th scale-rows, never on the anterior  third of the body as in _C. pulcher_. Even in juveniles the third pair  of dark stripes includes the lower part of the 9th scale-row in _C.  pulcher_, whereas the dorsal most dark stripe of _C. lineatus dunni_  never includes more than the lower part of the 8th scale-row.    _Distribution._--Pacific coastal region of Chiapas, Mexico,  southeastward into Guatemala; southeastern highlands and the dry  valley of central and eastern Guatemala; Caribbean lowlands of  Honduras southward to the region of Tegucigalpa, Honduras (fig. 4).    _Specimens examined._--Total of 27, as follows: GUATEMALA: _no  specific locality_, CNHM 22912, NMW 16830. _Jutiapa_: Hacienda Mongoy,  UMMZ 106725. _El Progreso_: El Progreso, CAS 67000; _El Rancho_, UMMZ  106724; _San Antonio_, CAS 66999. \"Peten,\" USNM 6751(2), 6803.  _Sacatepequez_: Duenas, BMNH 64.1.26.17, 64.1.26.126-127. _Zacapa_:  Pepesca, AMNH 72555-56.

With its carpenter's gouge, a  strong black mandible, short, devoid of notches, scooped into a  sharp-edged spoon, it digs the opening of its tunnel. The piece cut out  is a mouthful which, as it enters the stomach, yields its scanty juices  and accumulates behind the worker in heaps of wormed wood. The refuse  leaves room in front by passing through the worker. A labour at once of  nutrition and of road-making, the path is devoured while constructed;  it is blocked behind as it makes way ahead. That, however, is how all  the borers who look to wood for victuals and lodging set about their  business.    For the harsh work of its two gouges, or curved chisels, the larva of  the Capricorn concentrates its muscular strength in the front of its  body, which swells into a pestle-head. The Buprestis-grubs, those other  industrious carpenters, adopt a similar form; they even exaggerate  their pestle. The part that toils and carves hard wood requires a  robust structure; the rest of the body, which has but to follow after,  continues slim. The essential thing is that the implement of the jaws  should possess a solid support and a powerful motor. The Cerambyx-larva  strengthens its chisels with a stout, black, horny armour that  surrounds the mouth; yet, apart from its skull and its equipment of  tools, the grub has a skin as fine as satin and white as ivory. This  dead white comes from a copious layer of grease which the animal's  spare diet would not lead us to suspect. True, it has nothing to do, at  every hour of the day and night, but gnaw. The quantity of wood that  passes into its stomach makes up for the dearth of nourishing elements.    The legs, consisting of three pieces, the first globular, the last  sharp-pointed, are mere rudiments, vestiges. They are hardly a  millimetre long. (.039 inch.--Translator's Note.) For this reason they  are of no use whatever for walking; they do not even bear upon the  supporting surface, being kept off it by the obesity of the chest. The  organs of locomotion are something altogether different. The grub of  the Capricorn moves at the same time on its back and belly; instead of  the useless legs of the thorax, it has a walking-apparatus almost  resembling feet, which appear, contrary to every rule, on the dorsal  surface.    The first seven segments of the abdomen have, both above and below, a  four-sided facet, bristling with rough protuberances. This the grub can  either expand or contract, making it stick out or lie flat at will. The  upper facets consist of two excrescences separated by the mid-dorsal  line; the lower ones have not this divided appearance. These are the  organs of locomotion, the ambulacra. When the larva wishes to move  forwards, it expands its hinder ambulacra, those on the back as well as  those on the belly, and contracts its front ones. Fixed to the side of  the narrow gallery by their ridges, the hind-pads give the grub a  purchase. The flattening of the fore-pads, by decreasing the diameter,  allows it to slip forward and to take half a step. To complete the step  the hind-quarters have to be brought up the same distance. With this  object, the front pads fill out and provide support, while those behind  shrink and leave free scope for their segments to contract.    With the double support of its back and belly, with alternate puffings  and shrinkings, the animal easily advances or retreats along its  gallery, a sort of mould which the contents fill without a gap. But if  the locomotory pads grip only on one side progress becomes impossible.  When placed on the smooth wood of my table, the animal wriggles slowly;  it lengthens and shortens without advancing by a hair's-breadth. Laid  on the surface of a piece of split oak, a rough, uneven surface, due to  the gash made by the wedge, it twists and writhes, moves the front part  of its body very slowly from left to right and right to left, lifts it  a little, lowers it and begins again. These are the most extensive  movements made. The vestigial legs remain inert and absolutely useless.  Then why are they there? It were better to lose them altogether, if it  be true that crawling inside the oak has deprived the animal of the  good legs with which it started. The influence of environment, so  well-inspired in endowing the grub with ambulatory pads, becomes a  mockery when it leaves it these ridiculous stumps. Can the structure,  perchance, be obeying other rules than those of environment?    Though the useless legs, the germs of the future limbs, persist, there  is no sign in the grub of the eyes wherewith the Cerambyx will be  richly gifted. The larva has not the least trace of organs of vision.  What would it do with sight in the murky thickness of a tree-trunk?  Hearing is likewise absent. In the never-troubled silence of the oak's  inmost heart, the sense of hearing would be a non-sense. Where sounds  are lacking, of what use is the faculty of discerning them? Should  there be any doubts, I will reply to them with the following  experiment. Split lengthwise, the grub's abode leaves a half-tunnel  wherein I can watch the occupant's doings. When left alone, it now  gnaws the front of its gallery, now rests, fixed by its ambulacra to  the two sides of the channel. I avail myself of these moments of quiet  to inquire into its power of perceiving sounds. The banging of hard  bodies, the ring of metallic objects, the grating of a file upon a saw  are tried in vain. The animal remains impassive. Not a wince, not a  movement of the skin; no sign of awakened attention. I succeed no  better when I scratch the wood close by with a hard point, to imitate  the sound of some neighbouring larva gnawing the intervening thickness.  The indifference to my noisy tricks could be no greater in a lifeless  object. The animal is deaf.    Can it smell? Everything tells us no. Scent is of assistance in the  search for food. But the Capricorn grub need not go in quest of  eatables: it feeds on its home, it lives on the wood that gives it  shelter. Let us make an attempt or two, however. I scoop in a log of  fresh cypress-wood a groove of the same diameter as that of the natural  galleries and I place the worm inside it. Cypress-wood is strongly  scented; it possesses in a high degree that resinous aroma which  characterizes most of the pine family. Well, when laid in the  odoriferous channel, the larva goes to the end, as far as it can go,  and makes no further movement. Does not this placid quiescence point to  the absence of a sense of smell? The resinous flavour, so strange to  the grub which has always lived in oak, ought to vex it, to trouble it;  and the disagreeable impression ought to be revealed by a certain  commotion, by certain attempts to get away. Well, nothing of the kind  happens: once the larva has found the right position in the groove, it  does not stir. I do more: I set before it, at a very short distance, in  its normal canal, a piece of camphor. Again, no effect. Camphor is  followed by naphthaline. Still nothing. After these fruitless  endeavours, I do not think that I am going too far when I deny the  creature a sense of smell.    Taste is there, no doubt. But such taste! The food is without variety:  oak, for three years at a stretch, and nothing else. What can the  grub's palate appreciate in this monotonous fare? The tannic relish of  a fresh piece, oozing with sap, the uninteresting flavour of an  over-dry piece, robbed of its natural condiment: these probably  represent the whole gustative scale.    There remains touch, the far-spreading, passive sense common to all  live flesh that quivers under the goad of pain. The sensitive schedule  of the Cerambyx-grub, therefore, is limited to taste and touch, both  exceedingly obtuse. This almost brings us to Condillac's statue. The  imaginary being of the philosopher had one sense only, that of smell,  equal in delicacy to our own; the real being, the ravager of the oak,  has two, inferior, even when put together, to the former, which so  plainly perceived the scent of a rose and distinguished it so clearly  from any other. The real case will bear comparison with the fictitious.    What can be the psychology of a creature possessing such a powerful  digestive organism combined with such a feeble set of senses? A vain  wish has often come to me in my dreams; it is to be able to think, for  a few minutes, with the crude brain of my Dog, to see the world with  the faceted eyes of a Gnat. How things would change in appearance! They  would change much more if interpreted by the intellect of the grub.  What have the lessons of touch and taste contributed to that  rudimentary receptacle of impressions? Very little; almost nothing. The  animal knows that the best bits possess an astringent flavour; that the  sides of a passage not carefully planed are painful to the skin. This  is the utmost limit of its acquired wisdom. In comparison, the statue  with the sensitive nostrils was a marvel of knowledge, a paragon too  generously endowed by its inventor. It remembered, compared, judged,  reasoned: does the drowsily digesting paunch remember? Does it compare?  Does it reason? I defined the Capricorn-grub as a bit of an intestine  that crawls about. The undeniable accuracy of this definition provides  me with my answer: the grub has the aggregate of sense-impressions that  a bit of an intestine may hope to have.    And this nothing-at-all is capable of marvellous acts of foresight;  this belly, which knows hardly aught of the present, sees very clearly  into the future. Let us take an illustration on this curious subject.  For three years on end the larva wanders about in the thick of the  trunk; it goes up, goes down, turns to this side and that; it leaves  one vein for another of better flavour, but without moving too far from  the inner depths, where the temperature is milder and greater"]]]
