In the  year 1700 he took possession of the living at Laracor, and his mode of  entering upon his duty was thoroughly characteristic of the man. He  walked down to Laracor, entered the curate's house, and announced  himself \"as his master.\" In his usual style he affected brutality, and  having sufficiently alarmed his victims, gradually soothed and consoled  them by evidences of undoubted friendliness and good will. \"This,\" says  Sir Walter Scott, \"was the ruling trait of Swift's character to others;  his praise assumed the appearance and language of complaint; his  benefits were often prefaced by a prologue of a threatening nature.\"  \"The ruling trait\" of Swift's character was morbid eccentricity. Much  less eccentricity has saved many a murderer in our days from the  gallows. We approach a period of Swift's history when we must accept  this conclusion or revolt from the cold-blooded doings of a monster.    During Swift's second residence with Sir William Temple he had become  acquainted with an inmate of Moor Park very different to the  accomplished man to whose intellectual pleasures he so largely  ministered. A young and lovely girl--half ward, half dependent in the  establishment--engaged the attention and commanded the untiring services  of the newly-made minister. Esther Johnson had need of education, and  Swift became her tutor. He entered upon his task with avidity,  condescended to the humblest instruction, and inspired his pupil with  unbounded gratitude and regard. Swift was not more insensible to the  simplicity and beauty of the lady than she to the kind offices of her  master; but Swift would not have been Swift had he, like other men,  returned everyday love with ordinary affection. Swift had felt tender  impressions in his own fashion before. Once in Leicestershire he was  accused by a friend of having formed an imprudent attachment, on which  occasion he returned for answer, that his \"cold temper and unconfined  humor\" would prevent all serious consequences, even if it were not true  that the conduct which his friend had mistaken for gallantry had been  merely the evidence \"of an active and restless temper, incapable of  enduring idleness, and catching at such opportunities of amusement as  most readily occurred.\" Upon another occasion, and within four years of  the Leicestershire pastime, Swift made an absolute offer of his hand to  one Miss Waryng, vowing in his declaratory epistle that he would forego  every prospect of interest for the sake of his \"Varina,\" and that \"the  lady's love was far more fatal than her cruelty.\" After much and long  consideration Varina consented to the suit. That was enough for Swift.  He met the capitulation by charging his Varina with want of affection,  by stipulating for unheard-of sacrifices, and concluding with an  expression of his willingness to wed, \"_though she had neither fortune_  _nor beauty_,\" provided every article of his letter was ungrudgingly  agreed to. We may well tremble for Esther Johnson, with her young heart  given into such wild keeping.    [Illustration: \"STELLA.\" (ESTHER JOHNSON.)]    As soon as Swift was established at Laracor it was arranged that Esther,  who possessed a small property in Ireland, should take up her abode near  to her old preceptor. She came, and scandal was silenced by a  stipulation insisted upon by Swift, that his lovely charge should have a  matron for a constant companion, and never see him except in the  presence of a third party. Esther was in her seventeenth year. The vicar  of Laracor was on his road to forty. What wonder that even in Laracor  the former should receive an offer of marriage, and that the latter,  wayward and inconsistent from first to last, should deny another the  happiness he had resolved never to enjoy himself? Esther found a lover  whom Swift repulsed, to the infinite joy of the devoted girl, whose fate  was already linked for good or evil to that of her teacher and friend.    Obscurity and idleness were not for Swift. Love, that gradually consumed  the unoccupied girl, was not even this man's recreation. Impatient of  banishment, he went to London and mixed with the wits of the age.  Addison, Steele, and Arbuthnot became his friends, and he quickly proved  himself worthy of their intimacy by the publication in 1704 of his _Tale  of a Tub_. The success of the work, given to the world anonymously, was  decisive. Its singular merit obtained for its author everlasting renown,  and effectually prevented his rising to the highest dignity in the very  church which his book labored to exalt. None but an inspired madman  would have attempted to do honor to religion in a spirit which none but  the infidel could heartily approve.    Politicians are not squeamish. The Whigs could see no fault in raillery  and wit that might serve temporal interests with greater advantage than  they had advanced interests ecclesiastical; and the friends of the  Revolution welcomed so rare an adherent to their principles. With an  affected ardor that subsequent events proved to be as premature as it  was hollow, Swift's pen was put in harness for his allies, and worked  vigorously enough until 1709, when, having assisted Steele in the  establishment of the _Tatler_, the vicar of Laracor returned to Ireland  and to the duties of a rural pastor. Not to remain, however! A change  suddenly came over the spirit of the nation. Sacheverell was about to  pull down by a single sermon all the popularity that Marlborough and his  friends had built up by their glorious campaigns. Swift had waited in  vain for promotion from the Whigs, and his suspicions were roused when  the Lord-Lieutenant unexpectedly began to caress him. Escaping the  damage which the marked attentions of the old Government might do him  with the new, Swift started for England in 1710, in order to survey the  turning of the political wheel with his own eyes, and to try his fortune  in the game. The progress of events was rapid. Swift reached London on  the 9th of September; on the 1st of October he had already written a  lampoon upon an ancient associate; and on the 4th he was presented to  Harley, the new Minister.    The career of Swift from this moment, and so long as the government of  Harley lasted, was magnificent and mighty. Had he not been crotchety  from his very boyhood, his head would have been turned now. Swift  reigned; Swift was the Government; Swift was Queen, Lords, and Commons.  There was tremendous work to do, and Swift did it all. The Tories had  thrown out the Whigs and had brought in a Government in their place  quite as Whiggish to do Tory work. To moderate the wishes of the people,  if not to blind their eyes, was the preliminary and essential work of  the Ministry. They could not perform it themselves. Swift undertook the  task and accomplished it. He had intellect and courage enough for that,  and more. Moreover, he had vehement passions to gratify, and they might  all partake of the glory of his success; he was proud, and his pride  reveled in authority; he was ambitious, and his ambition could attain no  higher pitch than it found at the right hand of the Prime Minister; he  was revengeful, and revenge could wish no sweeter gratification than the  contortions of the great who had neglected genius and desert, when they  looked to them for advancement and obtained nothing but cold neglect.  Swift, single-handed, fought the Whigs. For seven months he conducted a  periodical paper, in which he mercilessly assailed, as none but himself  could attack, all who were odious to the Government and distasteful to  himself. Not an individual was spared whose sufferings could add to the  tranquillity and permanence of the Government. Resistance was in vain;  it was attempted, but invariably with one effect--the first wound  grazed, the second killed.    The public were in ecstasies. The laughers were all on the side of the  satirist, and how vast a portion of the community these are, needs not  be said. But it was not in the _Examiner_ alone that Swift offered up  his victims at the shrine of universal mirth. He could write verses for  the rough heart of a nation to chuckle over and delight in.  Personalities to-day fly wide of the mark; then they went right home.  The habits, the foibles, the moral and physical imperfections of  humanity, were all fair game, provided the shaft were tipped with gall  as well as venom. Short poems, longer pamphlets--whatever could help the  Government and cover their foes with ridicule and scorn, Swift poured  upon the town with an industry and skill that set eulogy at defiance.  And because they did defy praise, Jonathan Swift never asked, and was  ever too grand to accept it.    But he claimed much more. His disordered yet exquisite intellect  acknowledged no superiority. He asked no thanks for his labor, he  disdained pecuniary reward for his matchless and incalculable  services--he did not care for fame, but he imperiously demanded to be  treated by the greatest as an equal. Mr. Harley offered him money, and  he quarreled with the Minister for his boldness. \"If we let these great  Ministers,\" he said, \"pretend too much, _there will be no governing  them_.\" The same Minister desired to make Swift his chaplain. One  mistake was as great as the other. \"My Lord Oxford, by a second hand,  proposed my being his chaplain, which I, by a second hand, refused. I  will be no man's chaplain alive.\" The assumption of the man was more  than regal. At a later period of his life he drew up a list of his  friends, ranking them respectively under the heads \"Ungrateful,\"  \"Grateful,\" \"Indifferent,\" and \"Doubtful.\" Pope appears among the  grateful. Queen Caroline among the ungrateful. The audacity of these  distinctions is very edifying. What autocrat is here for whose mere  countenance the whole world is to bow down and be \"grateful!\"    It is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3788"],[0,"Haydn (#8)"],[1,"this term the said Joseph Heyden shall desire to leave the service,  he shall notify his intention to his Highness half-a-year beforehand.    \"14th. His Serene Highness undertakes to keep Joseph Heyden in his  service during this time, and should he be satisfied with him, he may  look forward to being appointed Capellmeister. This, however, must not  be understood to deprive his Serene Highness of the freedom to dismiss  the said Joseph Heyden at the expiration of the term, should he see fit  to do so.    \"Duplicate copies of this document shall be executed and exchanged.    \"Given at Vienna this 1st day of May 1761,    \"Ad mandatum Celsissimi Principis.    \"JOHANN STIFFTELL, Secretary.\"      An \"Upper Servant\"?    The situation indicated by this lengthy document has afforded matter for  a good deal of comment, and not a little foolish writing. With some  it is the old case of Porpora and the blacking of the boots. Thus Miss  Townsend remarks: \"Our indignation is roused at finding a great artist  placed in the position of an upper servant, and required to perform  duties almost menial in their nature.\" That is essentially a modern  view. These things have to be judged in relation to the ideas of the  age. It was only a few years before this that Johnson had contemptuously  thrown away a pair of boots which some pitying soul had placed at the  door of his rooms at Pembroke. The British mind likes to think of the  sturdy independence of the man who struck the death-blow at patronage in  literature. But Johnson himself had the meanest opinion of fiddlers.    Dependence in the Order of Nature    There was no talk in Haydn's native country of the dignity of art, at  any rate so far as musicians were concerned. When Mozart first arrived  in Vienna in 1781, he had to live with the archbishop's household, and  dine at the servants' table. Nay, he was known as \"the villain, the low  fellow.\" And is it altogether certain even now, in free Britain, that  the parish organist is very clearly distinguished in the squire's mind  from the peripatetic organ-grinder? Public opinion does not seem to  have commiserated Haydn on his position of dependence; and, as for Haydn  himself, he was no doubt only too glad to have an assured income and  a comfortable home. We may be certain that he did not find the yoke  unbearably galling. He was of humble birth; of a family which must  always have looked up to their \"betters\" as unspeakably and immeasurably  above them. Dependence was in the order of nature, and a man of Haydn's  good sense was the last in the world to starve and fret because his  freedom to practice his art and develop his powers was complicated with  a sort of feudal service. Some strong souls may find an empty purse the  truest source of inspiration, as Mr Russell Lowell declares it to be;  but it is very much to be doubted whether a careful investigation would  show that a great man's best work was done with the wolf at the door.    Material Advantages    Haydn had no self-pity: why should we pity him? He had free quarters at  the palace, with liberty to enjoy the company of his wife when she chose  to favour him--an event of rare occurrence. His salary was raised from  time to time. The old prince, his first employer, paid him 400 florins;  his successor increased the amount first to 600 and then to 782 florins  (78 pounds); and finally he had 1400 florins, which last sum was  continued to him as a pension when he left the Esterhazy service.  Although money had a much higher purchasing value in those days, the  figures here quoted do not seem princely when we consider the extent  and nature of Haydn's duties, but to a man of Haydn's simple tastes they  would appear ample enough. At least, they would save him from lying on  straw and drinking bad whisky, which Wagner regarded as among the things  that are inimical to the creative genius.    Artistic Advantages    These were the material advantages of the Eisenstadt appointment. The  artistic advantages were even more important, especially to a young and  inexperienced artist who, so far, had not enjoyed many opportunities of  practically testing his own work. Haydn had a very good band always at  his disposal, the members of which were devoted to him. If he wrote part  of a symphony over-night he could try it in the morning, prune, revise,  accept, reject. Many a young composer of to-day would rejoice at such an  opportunity, as indeed Haydn himself rejoiced at it. \"I not only had the  encouragement of constant approval,\" he says, speaking of this period of  his career, \"but as conductor of an orchestra I could make experiments,  observe what produced an effect and what weakened it, and was thus in a  position to improve, alter, make additions and omissions, and be as bold  as I pleased.\"    Some Disadvantages    No doubt there were some disadvantages in counterpoise. After the gay  life of Vienna, Eisenstadt must have been dull enough, and there is  plenty of evidence to show that the young artist occasionally fell into  the dumps. In one letter he complains that he \"never can obtain leave,  even for four-and-twenty hours, to go to Vienna.\" In another he writes:  \"I am doomed to stay at home. What I lose by so doing you can well  imagine. It is indeed sad always to be a slave, but Providence wills it  so. I am a poor creature, plagued perpetually by hard work, and with few  hours for recreation.\" Haydn clearly recognized the necessities of  the artist. A quiet life is all very well, but no man ever yet greatly  touched the hearts of men if he kept himself too strictly segregated  from his kind. Music, like every other art, would perish in a hot-house.  Reckon up to-day the composers who are really a force in the emotional  life of the people, and ask which of them was reared in the serene, cold  air of the academies. A composer to be great must live with his fellows,  and open his soul to human affluences. \"I was cut off from the world,\"  says Haydn. \"There was no one to confuse or torment me, and I was forced  to become original.\" But his originality was that of an active  mind working upon material already stored, and the store had to be  replenished in occasional excursions, all too few, from the palace.    The Eisenstadt appointment, then, provided for Haydn's material wants,  and gave him opportunities for the peaceful pursuit of his studies, for  experiment and self-criticism. He was treated with great consideration  by the Esterhazys, and, menial or not, he lived on their bounty and in  the friendliest relations with them.    Capellmeister Werner    From his agreement with Prince Esterhazy it will have been gathered  that, though virtually entrusted with the direction of the Eisenstadt  musical establishment, Haydn was really under the control of an old  official. Such arrangements seldom work well. The retention of Joseph  Werner was presumably due to the thoughtful kindness of his noble  patron, but it was bound to lead to awkward situations. Werner had  served the Esterhazys for thirty-two years, and could not be expected  to placidly accept his supersession by a young and as yet almost unknown  musician. True, he was not a very distinguished man himself. He had  composed a large amount of music, chiefly sacred, including thirty-nine  masses and twelve \"Oratorios for Good Friday,\" besides some grotesque  pieces intended as burlesques of the musical life of Vienna. Not one of  his works has any real musical value; but, as is usually the case with  the talent which stops short of genius, he thought a great deal of  himself, and was inclined to look down upon Haydn as an interloper,  unskilled in that rigid counterpoint which was the \"heaven's law\" of the  old-time composer. Indeed, he described his associate as \"a mere fop\"  and \"a scribbler of songs.\"    A Posthumous Tribute    It is but fair to Haydn to say that, if he did not suffer his nominal  superior gladly, he at least treated him with respect and a certain  deference. He did more. Werner died in 1766, having thus seen only five  years of the new order of things, but Haydn's regard for his memory was  such that, so late as 1804, he published six of his fugues arranged as  string quartets, \"out of sincere esteem for this celebrated master.\"  A kindness of heart and a total absence of professional jealousy  characterized Haydn throughout his whole career, and never more than in  this action.    Esterhazy \"the Magnificent\"    The composer had been rather less than a twelvemonth in his service when  Prince Paul Anton died on the 18th of March 1762. He was succeeded by  his brother Nicolaus, a sort of glorified \"Grand Duke\" of Chandos, who  rejoiced in the soubriquet of \"The Magnificent.\" He loved ostentation  and glitter above all things, wearing at times a uniform bedecked with  diamonds. But he loved music as well. More, he was a performer  himself, and played the baryton, a stringed instrument not unlike the  viola-da-gamba, in general use up to the end of the eighteenth century.  Haydn naturally desired to please his prince, and being perpetually  pestered to provide new works for the noble baryton player, he thought  it would flatter him if he himself learnt to handle the baryton. This  proved an unfortunate misreading of \"The Magnificent's\" character, for  when Haydn at length made his debut with the instrument, the prince lost  no time in letting him understand that he disapproved of such rivalry.  An amusing story is told of Kraft, the Eisenstadt 'cellist, at this  time, who occasionally played the second baryton. Kraft presented  the prince with a composition into which he had introduced a solo  for himself as second baryton. The prince asked to see the part, and  proceeded to try it over. Coming to a difficult passage, he exclaimed  indignantly: \"For the future, write solos only for my part; it is no  credit to you to play better than I; it is your duty.\"    Compositions for Baryton"]]]
