If a vicious cat  is to be taken from one pen to another, it must be carried by the loose  skin at the back of the neck and that of the back with both hands, and  held well away from the person who is carrying it.    [Illustration]      [Illustration]          THE RUSSIAN LONG-HAIRED CAT.      The above is a portrait of a cat given me many years ago, whose parents  came from Russia, but from what part I could never ascertain. It  differed from the Angora and the Persian in many respects. It was larger  in the body with shorter legs. The mane or frill was very large, long,  and dense, and more of a woolly texture, with coarse hairs among it; the  colour was of dark tabby, though the markings were not a decided black,  nor clear and distinct; the ground colour was wanting in that depth and  richness possessed by the Persian, having a somewhat dull appearance.  The eyes were large and prominent, of a bright orange, slightly tinted  with green, the ears large by comparison, with small tufts, full of  long, woolly hair, the limbs stout and short, the tail being very  dissimilar, as it was short, very woolly, and thickly covered with hair  the same length from the base to the tip, and much resembled in form  that of the English wild cat. Its motion was not so agile as other cats,  nor did it apparently care for warmth, as it liked being outdoors in the  coldest weather. Another peculiarity being that it seemed to care little  in the way of watching birds for the purpose of food, neither were its  habits like those of the short-haired cats that were its companions. It  attached itself to no person, as was the case with some of the others,  but curiously took a particular fancy to one of my short-haired,  silver-gray tabbies; the two appeared always together. In front of the  fire they sat side by side. If one left the room the other followed.  Adown the garden paths there they were, still companions; and at night  slept in the same box; they drank milk from the same saucer, and fed  from the same plate, and, in fact, only seemed to exist for each other.  In all my experience I never knew a more devoted couple. I bred but one  kitten from the Russian, and this was the offspring of the short-haired  silver tabby. It was black-and-white, and resembled the Russian in a  large degree, having a woolly coat, somewhat of a mane, and a short,  very bushy tail. This, like his father, seemed also to be fonder of  animals for food than birds, and, although very small, would without any  hesitation attack and kill a full-grown rat. I have seen several Russian  cats, yet never but on this occasion had the opportunity of comparing  their habits and mode of life with those of the other varieties; neither  have I seen any but those of a tabby colour, and they mostly of a dark  brown. I am fully aware that many cross-bred cats are sold as Russian,  Angora, and Persian, either between these or the short-haired, and some  of these, of course, retain in large degree the distinctive  peculiarities of each breed. Yet to the practised eye there is  generally--I do not say always--a difference of some sort by which the  particular breed may be clearly defined. When the prizes are given, as  is the case even at our largest cat shows, for the best long-haired cat,  there, of course, exists in the eye of the judge no distinction as  regards breed. He selects, as he is bound to do, that which is the best  _long-haired_ cat in all points, the length of hair, colour, texture,  and condition of the exhibit being that which commands his first  attention. But if it were so put that the prize should be for the best  Angora, Persian, Russian, etc., it would make the task rather more than  difficult, for I have seen some \"first-cross cats\" that have possessed  all, or nearly all, the points requisite for that of the Angora,  Persian, or Russian, while others so bred have been very deficient,  perhaps showing the Angora cross only by the tail and a slight and small  frill. At the same time it must be noted, that, although from time to  time some excellent specimens may be so bred, it is by no means  desirable to buy and use such for stock purposes, for they will in all  probability \"throw back\"--that is, after several generations, although  allied with thoroughbred, they will possibly have a little family of  quite \"short-hairs.\" I have known this with rabbits, who, after breeding  short-haired varieties for some time, suddenly reverted to a litter of  \"long-hairs\"; but have not carried out the experiment with cats. At the  same time I may state that I have little or no doubt that such would be  the case; therefore I would urge on all those who are fond of cats--or,  in fact, other animals--of any particular breed, to use when possible  none but those of the purest pedigree, as this will tend to prevent much  disappointment that might otherwise ensue. But I am digressing, and so  back to my subject--the Russian long-haired cat. I advisedly say  long-haired cat, for I shall hereafter have to treat of other cats  coming from Russia that are short-haired, none which I have hitherto  seen being tabbies, but whole colour. This is the more singular as all  those of the long-hair have been brown tabbies, with only one or two  exceptions, which were black. It is just possible these were the  offspring of tabby or gray parents, as the wild rabbit has been known to  have had black progeny. I have seen a black rabbit shot from amongst the  gray on the South Downs.    [Illustration: MISS MARY GRESHAM'S PERSIAN KITTEN, \"LAMBKIN.\"]    I do not remember having seen a white Russian \"long-hair,\" and I should  feel particularly obliged to any of my readers who could supply me with  further information on this subject, or on any other relating to the  various breeds of cats, cat-life and habits. I am fully aware that no  two cats are exactly alike either in their form, colour, movements, or  habits; but what I have given much study and attention to, and what I  wish to arrive at is, the broad existing natural distinctions of the  different varieties. In this way I shall feel grateful for any  information.    [Illustration]    The above engraving and description of a very peculiar animal is from  Daniel's \"Rural Sports,\" 1813:    \"This Cat was the Property of Mrs. Finch, of Maldon, Essex. In the  Account of this _Lusus Naturae_, for such it may be deemed, the _Mother_  had no other Likeness to her Production, than her Colour, which is a  _tawny Sandy_, in some parts lightly streaked with _black_; She had  this, and another Kitten _like it_, about _two Years_ since. The fellow  Kitten was killed, in consequence of being troublesome, to the Mistress  of the House, where it was presented. _This_ is a _Male_, above the  _usual_ Size, with a _shaggy_ Appearance round its Face, resembling that  of the Lion's, in _Miniature_. The _Hair_ protruding from the _Ears_,  formerly grew, like what are termed _Cork-screw Curls_, and which are  frequently seen, among the _smart_ young _Watermen_, on the Thames; the  Tail is perfectly distinct, from that of the Cat Species, and resembles  the _Brush_ of a Fox. The Mother, has at this time (1813), three Young  ones, but without the least Difference to _common_ Kittens, neither,  indeed, has she ever had any _before_, or since, similar to _That_ here  described. The Proprietor has been offered, and refused One Hundred  Pounds for this Animal.\"    [Illustration]    This was either a cross with the English wild cat, which sometimes has a  mane, or it was an accidental variation of nature. I once bred a  long-haired rabbit in a similar way, but at first I failed entirely to  perpetuate the peculiarity. I think the above simply \"a sport.\"    [Illustration: MISS MARY GRESHAM'S PERSIAN KITTEN, \"LAMBKIN NO. 2.\"]      [Illustration: MISS MOORE'S \"BOGEY.\"]    I have now concluded my remarks on the long-haired varieties of cats  that I am at present acquainted with. They are an exceedingly  interesting section; their habits, manners, forms, and colours form a by  no means unprofitable study for those fond of animal life, as they, in  my opinion, differ in many ways from those of their \"short-haired\"  brethren. I shall not cease, however, in my endeavours to find out if  any other long-haired breeds exist, and I am, therefore, making  inquiries in every direction in which I deem it likely I shall get an  increase of information on the subject, but hitherto without any  success. Therefore, I am led to suppose that the three I have  enumerated are the only domesticated long-haired varieties. The nearest  approach, I believe, to these in the wild state is that of the British  wild cat, which has in some instances a mane and a bushy tail, slightly  resembling that of the Russian long-hair, with much of the same facial  expression, and rather pointed tufts at the apex of the ears. It is also  large, like some of the \"long-haired\" cats that I have seen; in fact, it  far more resembles these breeds than those of the short hair. I was much  struck with the many points of similitude on seeing the British wild cat  exhibited by the Duke of Sutherland at the first cat show at the Crystal  Palace in July, 1871. I merely offer this as an idea for further  consideration. At the same time, allow me to say that I have had no  opportunity of studying the anatomy of the British wild cat, in  contradistinction to that of the Russian, or others with long hair. I  only wish to point out what I term a general resemblance, far in excess  of those with short hair. I am fully aware how difficult it is to trace  any origin of the domestic cat, or from what breeds; it is also said,  that the British wild cat is not one of them, still I urge there exists  the similarity I mention; whether it is so apparent to others I"]]]
