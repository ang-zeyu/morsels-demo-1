During all this time, we have been behind French troops, and only  helping our own people by oblique fire when necessary. Our horses have  suffered heavily too. Bonfire had a light wound from a piece of shell;  it is healing and the dear old fellow is very fit. Had my first ride  for seventeen days last night. We never saw horses but with the wagons  bringing up the ammunition. When fire was hottest they had to come two  miles on a road terribly swept, and they did it magnificently. But how  tired we are! Weary in body and wearier in mind. None of our men went  off their heads but men in units nearby did--and no wonder.        France, May 12th, 1915.    I am glad you had your mind at rest by the rumour that we were in  reserve. What newspaper work! The poor old artillery never gets any  mention, and the whole show is the infantry. It may interest you to  note on your map a spot on the west bank of the canal, a mile and a half  north of Ypres, as the scene of our labours. There can be no harm in  saying so, now that we are out of it. The unit was the most advanced  of all the Allies' guns by a good deal except one French battery which  stayed in a position yet more advanced for two days, and then had to be  taken out. I think it may be said that we saw the show from the soup to  the coffee.        France, May 17th, 1915.    The farther we get away from Ypres the more we learn of the enormous  power the Germans put in to push us over. Lord only knows how many men  they had, and how many they lost. I wish I could embody on paper some of  the varied sensations of that seventeen days. All the gunners down this  way passed us all sorts of 'kudos' over it. Our guns--those behind  us, from which we had to dodge occasional prematures--have a peculiar  bang-sound added to the sharp crack of discharge. The French 75 has a  sharp wood-block-chop sound, and the shell goes over with a peculiar  whine--not unlike a cat, but beginning with n--thus,--n-eouw. The big  fellows, 3000 yards or more behind, sounded exactly like our own, but  the flash came three or four seconds before the sound. Of the German  shells--the field guns come with a great velocity--no warning--just  whizz-bang; white smoke, nearly always air bursts. The next size,  probably 5 inch howitzers, have a perceptible time of approach, an  increasing whine, and a great burst on the percussion--dirt in all  directions. And even if a shell hit on the front of the canal bank, and  one were on the back of the bank, five, eight, or ten seconds later  one would hear a belated WHIRR, and curved pieces of shell would  light--probably parabolic curves or boomerangs. These shells have a  great back kick; from the field gun shrapnel we got nothing BEHIND the  shell--all the pieces go forward. From the howitzers, the danger is  almost as great behind as in front if they burst on percussion. Then the  large shrapnel--air-burst--have a double explosion, as if a giant shook  a wet sail for two flaps; first a dark green burst of smoke; then  a lighter yellow burst goes out from the centre, forwards. I do not  understand the why of it.    Then the 10-inch shells: a deliberate whirring course--a deafening  explosion--black smoke, and earth 70 or 80 feet in the air. These always  burst on percussion. The constant noise of our own guns is really worse  on the nerves than the shell; there is the deafening noise, and the  constant whirr of shells going overhead. The earth shakes with every  nearby gun and every close shell. I think I may safely enclose a cross  section of our position. The left is the front: a slope down of 20 feet  in 100 yards to the canal, a high row of trees on each bank, then a  short 40 yards slope up to the summit of the trench, where the brain of  the outfit was; then a telephone wired slope, and on the sharp slope,  the dugouts, including my own. The nondescript affair on the low slope  is the gun position, behind it the men's shelter pits. Behind my dugout  was a rapid small stream, on its far bank a row of pollard willows, then  30 yards of field, then a road with two parallel rows of high trees.  Behind this again, several hundred yards of fields to cross before the  main gun positions are reached.    More often fire came from three quarters left, and because our ridge  died away there was a low spot over which they could come pretty  dangerously. The road thirty yards behind us was a nightmare to me.  I saw all the tragedies of war enacted there. A wagon, or a bunch of  horses, or a stray man, or a couple of men, would get there just in time  for a shell. One would see the absolute knock-out, and the obviously  lightly wounded crawling off on hands and knees; or worse yet, at night,  one would hear the tragedy--\"that horse scream\"--or the man's moan. All  our own wagons had to come there (one every half hour in smart action),  be emptied, and the ammunition carried over by hand. Do you wonder that  the road got on our nerves? On this road, too, was the house where we  took our meals. It was hit several times, windows all blown in by nearby  shells, but one end remained for us.    Seventeen days of Hades! At the end of the first day if anyone had told  us we had to spend seventeen days there, we would have folded our hands  and said it could not be done. On the fifteenth day we got orders to  go out, but that was countermanded in two hours. To the last we could  scarcely believe we were actually to get out. The real audacity of the  position was its safety; the Germans knew to a foot where we were. I  think I told you of some of the \"you must stick it out\" messages we got  from our [French] General,--they put it up to us. It is a wonder to me  that we slept when, and how, we did. If we had not slept and eaten as  well as possible we could not have lasted. And while we were doing  this, the London office of a Canadian newspaper cabled home \"Canadian  Artillery in reserve.\" Such is fame!        Thursday, May 27th, 1915.    Day cloudy and chilly. We wore our greatcoats most of the afternoon,  and looked for bits of sunlight to get warm. About two o'clock the heavy  guns gave us a regular \"black-smithing\". Every time we fired we drew a  perfect hornet's nest about our heads. While attending to a casualty,  a shell broke through both sides of the trench, front and back, about  twelve feet away. The zigzag of the trench was between it and us, and we  escaped. From my bunk the moon looks down at me, and the wind whistles  along the trench like a corridor. As the trenches run in all directions  they catch the wind however it blows, so one is always sure of a good  draught. We have not had our clothes off since last Saturday, and there  is no near prospect of getting them off.        Friday, May 28th, 1915.    Warmer this morning and sunny, a quiet morning, as far as we were  concerned. One battery fired twenty rounds and the rest \"sat tight\".  Newspapers which arrive show that up to May 7th, the Canadian public has  made no guess at the extent of the battle of Ypres. The Canadian  papers seem to have lost interest in it after the first four days; this  regardless of the fact that the artillery, numerically a quarter of  the division, was in all the time. One correspondent writes from the  Canadian rest camp, and never mentions Ypres. Others say they hear heavy  bombarding which appears to come from Armentieres.          A few strokes will complete the picture:        Wednesday, April 29th*, 1915.    This morning is the sixth day of this fight; it has been constant,  except that we got good chance to sleep for the last two nights. Our  men have fought beyond praise. Canadian soldiers have set a standard for  themselves which will keep posterity busy to surpass. And the War Office  published that the 4.1 guns captured were Canadian. They were not: the  division has not lost a gun so far by capture. We will make a good job  of it--if we can.           * [sic]  This should read April 28th.--A. L., 1995.        May 1st, 1915.    This is the ninth day that we have stuck to the ridge, and the batteries  have fought with a steadiness which is beyond all praise. If I could say  what our casualties in men, guns, and horses were, you would see at a  glance it has been a hot corner; but we have given better than we  got, for the German casualties from this front have been largely from  artillery, except for the French attack of yesterday and the day before,  when they advanced appreciably on our left. The front, however, just  here remains where it was, and the artillery fire is very heavy--I think  as heavy here as on any part of the line, with the exception of certain  cross-roads which are the particular object of fire. The first four days  the anxiety was wearing, for we did not know at what minute the German  army corps would come for us. We lie out in support of the French troops  entirely, and are working with them. Since that time evidently great  reinforcements have come in, and now we have a most formidable force of  artillery to turn on them.    Fortunately the weather has been good; the days are hot and summer-like.  Yesterday in the press of bad smells I got a whiff of a hedgerow in  bloom. The birds perch on the trees over our heads and twitter away as  if there was nothing to worry about. Bonfire is still well. I do hope he  gets through all right.        Flanders, March 30th, 1915.    The Brigade is actually in twelve different places. The ammunition  column and the horse and wagon lines are back, and my corporal visits  them every day. I attend the gun lines; any casualty is reported by  telephone, and I go to it. The wounded and sick stay where they are till  dark, when the field ambulances go over certain grounds and collect.

You do understand!\"    There was a look of relief in his eyes. His lips took on a gentler  curve. \"I see that you are going to help me.\"    \"If it is in my power, I surely am. Where shall we begin?\"    \"Tell me all that you can about Charles Brierly, all that he has told  you about himself. Will it be too hard?\"    \"No matter.\" She drew herself more erect. \"I think if you will let me  tell my own story briefly, and then fill it out at need, by  interrogation, it will be easiest for me.\"    \"And best for me. Thank you.\" He leaned back and rested his hands upon  the arms of his chair.    \"I am ready to hear you,\" he said, and withdrew his full gaze from her  face, letting his eyelids fall and sitting thus with half-closed eyes.    \"Of course,\" she began, \"it was only natural, or so it appeared to me,  that we should become friends soon, meeting, as we must, daily, and  being so constantly brought together, as upper and under teachers in  this little village school. He never seemed really strange to me, and we  seemed thrown upon each other for society, for the young people of the  village held aloof, because of our newness, and our position, I suppose,  and the people of the hotels and boarding-houses found, naturally, a  set, or sets, by themselves. I grew up in what you might call a  religious atmosphere, and when I knew that he was a minister of the  gospel, I felt at once full confidence in him and met his friendly  advances quite frankly. I think we understood each other very soon. You  perhaps have not been told that he filled a vacancy, taking the place of  a young man who was called away because of his mother's illness, and who  did not return, giving up the school at her request. It was in April, a  year ago, that he--Charlie--took up the work, coming back, as I did,  after the summer vacation. It was after that that he began telling me  about himself a little; to speak often of his brother, who was, to his  eyes, a model of young manhood and greatly his intellectual superior.\"    She paused a moment, and then with a little proud lifting of her rounded  chin, resumed--    \"I was not quite willing to agree as to the superiority; for Charles  Brierly was as bright, as talented and promising a young man, as good  and as modest as any I ever knew or hope to know, and I have met some  who rank high as pastors and orators.\"    \"I can well believe you,\" he said, with his eyes upon her face, and his  voice was sincere and full of sympathy.    \"We were not engaged until quite recently. Although we both, I think,  understood ourselves and each other long before. And now, what more can  I say? He has told me much of his school days, of his student life, and,  of course, of his brother's also. In fact, without meaning it, he has  taught me to stand somewhat in awe of this highly fastidious, faultless  and much-beloved brother, but I have heard of no family quarrel, no  enemy, no unpleasant episode of any sort. For himself, he told me, and I  believe his lightest word, that he never cared for any other woman; had  never been much in women's society, in fact, owing to his almost  constant study and travel. Here in the village all was his friends; his  pupils were all his adorers, young and old alike were his admirers, and  he had room in his heart for all. No hand in Glenville was ever raised  against him, I am sure.\"    \"You think then that it was perhaps an accident, a mistake?\" He was  eyeing her keenly from beneath his drooping lashes.    \"No!\" She sprang suddenly to her feet and stood erect before him. \"No,  Mr. Ferrars, I do not! I cannot. I was never in my life superstitious. I  do not believe it is superstition that compels me to feel that Charles  Brierly was murdered of intent, and by an enemy, an enemy who has  stalked him unawares, for money perhaps, and who has planned cunningly,  and hid his traces well.\"          CHAPTER VI.    \"WHICH?\"      \"Give me a few moments of your time, doctor, after your guest has  retired for the night.\"    For more than two hours after his parting with Hilda Grant, Ferrars had  talked, first with Robert Brierly alone, and then with the doctor as a  third party. At the end, the three had gone together to look upon the  face of the dead, and now, as the doctor nodded over his shoulders and  silently followed, or, rather, guided Brierly from the room and toward  his sleeping apartment, the detective turned back, and when they were  out of hearing, removed the covering from the still face, and taking a  lamp from the table near, stood looking down upon the dead.    \"No,\" he murmured at last, as he replaced the lamp and turned back to  the side of the bier. \"You never earned such a fate. You must have lived  and died a good man; an honest man, and yet----\" He turned quickly at  the sound of the opening door. \"Doctor, come here and tell me how your  keen eyes and worldly intelligence weighed, measured and gauged this man  who lies here with that look, that inscrutable look they all wear once  they have seen the mystery unveiled. What manner of man did you find  him?\"    Doctor Barnes came closer and gazed reverently down upon the dead face.    \"There lies a man who could better afford to face the mystery suddenly,  without warning, than you or I or any other living man I know. A good  man, a true Christian gentleman I honestly believe, too modest perhaps  to ever claim and hold his true place in this grasping world. That he  should be struck down by the hand of an assassin is past belief, and  yet----\" He paused abruptly and bent down to replace the covering over  the still, handsome face.    \"And yet,\" repeated the detective, \"do you really think that this man  was murdered?\"    \"Ferrars!\" Both men were moving away from the side of the bier, one on  either hand, and, as they came together at its foot, the speaker put a  hand upon the shoulder of the detective. \"To-morrow I hope you will  thoroughly overlook the wood road beyond the school house, the lake  shore, from the village to the knoll or mound; and the thin strip of  wood between, and then tell me if you think it possible for any one,  however stupid or erratic of aim, to shoot by accident a man standing in  that place. There is no spot from which a bullet could have been fired  whence a man could not have been seen perfectly by that figure by the  lake side. The trees are so scattered, the bushes so low, the view up  and down so open. It's impossible!\"    \"That is your fixed opinion?\"    \"It is. Nothing but actual proof to the contrary would change it.\"    When they had passed from the room and the doctor had softly closed the  door, leaving the dead alone in the silence and the shaded lamp-light,  they paused again, face to face, in the outer office.    \"Have you any suggestions as regards the inquest, Ferrars?\" asked the  one.    \"I have been thinking about that foolish lad, the one who saw poor  Brierly in the wood. Could you get him here before the inquiry? We might  be able to learn more in this way. You know the lad, of course?\"    \"Of course. There will be very little to be got from him. But I'll have  him here for you.\"    \"Do so. And the lady, the one who drove the pony; you will call her, I  suppose?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"That is all, I think. If you can drive me to the spot very early,  before we breakfast even, I would like it. You need not stop for me. I  can find my way back, prefer to, in fact. You say it is not far?\"    \"Little more than half a mile from the school-house.\"    \"Then--good night, doctor.\"    Doctor Barnes occupied a six-room cottage with a mansard, and he had  fitted up the room originally meant to be a sitting-room, for his own  sleeping apartment. It was at the front of the main cottage, and back of  it was the inner office where the body lay, the outer office being in a  wing built out from this rear room and opening conveniently outward, in  view of the front entrance, and very close to a little side gate. A  porch fitted snugly into the angle made by the former sitting-room and  this outer office, and both of these rooms could be entered from this  convenient porch. Robert Brierly occupied the room opposite that  assigned the detective with the width of the hall between them, and the  doctor, although Ferrars did not know this, had camped down in his outer  office.    Half an hour after he had parted from the doctor, Frank Ferrars, as he  was called by his nearest and most familiar friends, opened the door  upon the corner porch and stepped noiselessly out. When he believed  that he had found an unusual case--and he cared for no others--he  seldom slept until he had thought out some plan of work, adopted some  theory, or evolved a possibility, or, as he whimsically termed it, a  \"stepping stone\" toward clearer knowledge.    He had answered the doctor's summons with little thought of what it  might mean, or lead to, and simply because it was from \"Walt.\" Barnes.  Then he had heard the doctor's brief story with some surprise, and an  inclination to think it might end, after all, in a case of accidental  shooting, or self-inflicted death. But when he looked into the woeful  eyes of lovely Hilda Grant, and clasped the hand of the dead man's  brother, the case took on a new interest. Here was no commonplace  village maiden hysterical and forlorn, no youth breathing out dramatic  vows of vengeance upon an unknown foe. At once his heart went out to  them, his sympathy was theirs, and the sympathy of Francis Ferrars was  of a very select nature indeed.    And thus he had looked at the beautiful refined face of the dead man, a  face that told of gentleness, sweetness, loyalty, all manifest in the  calm dignity of death. Not a strong face, as his brother's face was  strong, but manly with the true Christian manliness, and strong with the  strength of truth. Looking upon this face, all thought of  self-destruction forsook the detective, and he stood,"]]]
