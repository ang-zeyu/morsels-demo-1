[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3457"],[0,"The Man of the Forest (#8)"],[1," yielded to Bo's wild  importunities to take her West. The spirit which had made Bo  incorrigible at home probably would make her react happily to life out  in this free country. Yet Helen, with all her warmth and gratefulness,  had to laugh at her sister.    \"Your red-faced cowboy! Why, Bo, you were scared stiff. And now you  claim him!\"    \"I certainly could love that fellow,\" replied Bo, dreamily.    \"Child, you've been saying that about fellows for a long time. And  you've never looked twice at any of them yet.\"    \"He was different.... Nell, I'll bet he comes to Pine.\"    \"I hope he does. I wish he was on this train. I liked his looks, Bo.\"    \"Well, Nell dear, he looked at ME first and last--so don't get your  hopes up.... Oh, the train's starting!... Good-by, Albu-ker--what's that  awful name?... Nell, let's eat dinner. I'm starved.\"    Then Helen forgot her troubles and the uncertain future, and what with  listening to Bo's chatter, and partaking again of the endless good  things to eat in the huge basket, and watching the noble mountains, she  drew once more into happy mood.    The valley of the Rio Grande opened to view, wide near at hand in a  great gray-green gap between the bare black mountains, narrow in the  distance, where the yellow river wound away, glistening under a hot  sun. Bo squealed in glee at sight of naked little Mexican children that  darted into adobe huts as the train clattered by, and she exclaimed her  pleasure in the Indians, and the mustangs, and particularly in a group  of cowboys riding into town on spirited horses. Helen saw all Bo pointed  out, but it was to the wonderful rolling valley that her gaze clung  longest, and to the dim purple distance that seemed to hold something  from her. She had never before experienced any feeling like that; she  had never seen a tenth so far. And the sight awoke something strange  in her. The sun was burning hot, as she could tell when she put a hand  outside the window, and a strong wind blew sheets of dry dust at the  train. She gathered at once what tremendous factors in the Southwest  were the sun and the dust and the wind. And her realization made her  love them. It was there; the open, the wild, the beautiful, the lonely  land; and she felt the poignant call of blood in her--to seek, to  strive, to find, to live. One look down that yellow valley, endless  between its dark iron ramparts, had given her understanding of her  uncle. She must be like him in spirit, as it was claimed she resembled  him otherwise.    At length Bo grew tired of watching scenery that contained no life, and,  with her bright head on the faded cloak, she went to sleep. But Helen  kept steady, farseeing gaze out upon that land of rock and plain; and  during the long hours, as she watched through clouds of dust and veils  of heat, some strong and doubtful and restless sentiment seemed to  change and then to fix. It was her physical acceptance--her eyes and her  senses taking the West as she had already taken it in spirit.    A woman should love her home wherever fate placed her, Helen believed,  and not so much from duty as from delight and romance and living. How  could life ever be tedious or monotonous out here in this tremendous  vastness of bare earth and open sky, where the need to achieve made  thinking and pondering superficial?    It was with regret that she saw the last of the valley of the Rio  Grande, and then of its paralleled mountain ranges. But the miles  brought compensation in other valleys, other bold, black upheavals of  rock, and then again bare, boundless yellow plains, and sparsely cedared  ridges, and white dry washes, ghastly in the sunlight, and dazzling  beds of alkali, and then a desert space where golden and blue flowers  bloomed.    She noted, too, that the whites and yellows of earth and rock had  begun to shade to red--and this she knew meant an approach to  Arizona. Arizona, the wild, the lonely, the red desert, the green  plateau--Arizona with its thundering rivers, its unknown spaces, its  pasture-lands and timber-lands, its wild horses, cowboys, outlaws,  wolves and lions and savages! As to a boy, that name stirred and  thrilled and sang to her of nameless, sweet, intangible things,  mysterious and all of adventure. But she, being a girl of twenty, who  had accepted responsibilities, must conceal the depths of her heart and  that which her mother had complained was her misfortune in not being  born a boy.    Time passed, while Helen watched and learned and dreamed. The train  stopped, at long intervals, at wayside stations where there seemed  nothing but adobe sheds and lazy Mexicans, and dust and heat. Bo awoke  and began to chatter, and to dig into the basket. She learned from the  conductor that Magdalena was only two stations on. And she was full of  conjectures as to who would meet them, what would happen. So Helen was  drawn back to sober realities, in which there was considerable zest.  Assuredly she did not know what was going to happen. Twice Riggs passed  up and down the aisle, his dark face and light eyes and sardonic smile  deliberately forced upon her sight. But again Helen fought a growing  dread with contemptuous scorn. This fellow was not half a man. It was  not conceivable what he could do, except annoy her, until she arrived  at Pine. Her uncle was to meet her or send for her at Snowdrop, which  place, Helen knew, was distant a good long ride by stage from Magdalena.  This stage-ride was the climax and the dread of all the long journey, in  Helen's considerations.    \"Oh, Nell!\" cried Bo, with delight. \"We're nearly there! Next station,  the conductor said.\"    \"I wonder if the stage travels at night,\" said Helen, thoughtfully.    \"Sure it does!\" replied the irrepressible Bo.    The train, though it clattered along as usual, seemed to Helen to fly.  There the sun was setting over bleak New Mexican bluffs, Magdalena was  at hand, and night, and adventure. Helen's heart beat fast. She  watched the yellow plains where the cattle grazed; their presence, and  irrigation ditches and cottonwood-trees told her that the railroad part  of the journey was nearly ended. Then, at Bo's little scream, she  looked across the car and out of the window to see a line of low, flat,  red-adobe houses. The train began to slow down. Helen saw children run,  white children and Mexican together; then more houses, and high upon a  hill an immense adobe church, crude and glaring, yet somehow beautiful.    Helen told Bo to put on her bonnet, and, performing a like office for  herself, she was ashamed of the trembling of her fingers. There were  bustle and talk in the car.    The train stopped. Helen peered out to see a straggling crowd of  Mexicans and Indians, all motionless and stolid, as if trains or nothing  else mattered. Next Helen saw a white man, and that was a relief. He  stood out in front of the others. Tall and broad, somehow striking, he  drew a second glance that showed him to be a hunter clad in gray-fringed  buckskin, and carrying a rifle.        CHAPTER V    Here, there was no kindly brakeman to help the sisters with their  luggage. Helen bade Bo take her share; thus burdened, they made an  awkward and laborious shift to get off the train.    Upon the platform of the car a strong hand seized Helen's heavy bag,  with which she was straining, and a loud voice called out:    \"Girls, we're here--sure out in the wild an' woolly West!\"    The speaker was Riggs, and he had possessed himself of part of her  baggage with action and speech meant more to impress the curious  crowd than to be really kind. In the excitement of arriving Helen  had forgotten him. The manner of sudden reminder--the insincerity of  it--made her temper flash. She almost fell, encumbered as she was, in  her hurry to descend the steps. She saw the tall hunter in gray step  forward close to her as she reached for the bag Riggs held.    \"Mr. Riggs, I'll carry my bag,\" she said.    \"Let me lug this. You help Bo with hers,\" he replied, familiarly.    \"But I want it,\" she rejoined, quietly, with sharp determination. No  little force was needed to pull the bag away from Riggs.    \"See here, Helen, you ain't goin' any farther with that joke, are you?\"  he queried, deprecatingly, and he still spoke quite loud.    \"It's no joke to me,\" replied Helen. \"I told you I didn't want your  attention.\"    \"Sure. But that was temper. I'm your friend--from your home town. An' I  ain't goin' to let a quarrel keep me from lookin' after you till you're  safe at your uncle's.\"    Helen turned her back upon him. The tall hunter had just helped Bo off  the car. Then Helen looked up into a smooth bronzed face and piercing  gray eyes.    \"Are you Helen Rayner?\" he asked.    \"Yes.\"    \"My name's Dale. I've come to meet you.\"    \"Ah! My uncle sent you?\" added Helen, in quick relief.    \"No; I can't say Al sent me,\" began the man, \"but I reckon--\"    He was interrupted by Riggs, who, grasping Helen by the arm, pulled her  back a step.    \"Say, mister, did Auchincloss send you to meet my young friends here?\"  he demanded, arrogantly.    Dale's glance turned from Helen to Riggs. She could not read this quiet  gray gaze, but it thrilled her.    \"No. I come on my own hook,\" he answered.    \"You'll understand, then--they're in my charge,\" added Riggs.    This time the steady light-gray eyes met Helen's, and if there was not a  smile in them or behind them she was still further baffled.    \"Helen, I reckon you said you didn't want this fellow's attention.\"    \"I certainly said that,\" replied Helen, quickly. Just then Bo slipped  close to her and gave her arm a little squeeze. Probably Bo's thought  was like hers--here was a real Western man. That was her first  impression, and following swiftly upon it was a sensation of eased  nerves.    Riggs swaggered closer to Dale.    \"Say, Buckskin, I hail from Texas--\"    \"You're wastin' our time an' we've need to hurry,\" interrupted Dale.

Wilt thou stay in the forest and be my bride?\"    And she answered, \"I will never leave my pine tree lover.\"    The sun stood high above the sacred grove and Leelinau had not  returned to her father's lodge. Friends were sent to bring her to the  village but they came back with the report that the maiden was not in  the forest. The great chief and his warriors searched far and wide for  the lost maiden. She had disappeared so completely that the  keenest-eyed Indians could discover no trace of her. The chief  departed without his bride and for a year no tidings of Leelinau came  to the village.    It happened one calm evening when the sun was sinking into the Big Sea  Water, that an Indian youth in a birch bark canoe was swiftly skimming  along toward the shore bordered by the sacred grove. There, standing  near the deep forest, was a familiar figure. It was Leelinau, the lost  maiden. In his surprise and joy the youth shouted to her and she  waved her hand to him in recognition. Then he noticed that she was  not alone. By her side stood a handsome brave with a green plume  standing high on his head. With all his might the young Indian  quickened the speed of his canoe and in a few moments he sprang  ashore. But where were Leelinau and the young brave! They had  disappeared and not a trace of them was to be found on the lonely  shore or in the forest.    The youth returned to the village and told his story. Reverently the  people bowed their heads and whispered, \"Leelinau will never come back  to us. She is the bride of her favourite pine tree.\"          THE HOLLY    Janet Harvey Kelman      The Holly is our most important evergreen, and is so well known that  it scarcely needs any description. It has flourished in this country  as long as the Oak, and is often found growing under tall trees in the  crowded forests, as well as in the open glades, where lawns of fine  grass are to be found.    People say that the Holly, or Holm tree, as it is often called, is the  greenwood tree spoken of by Shakespeare, and that under its bushy  shelter Robin Hood and his merry men held their meetings in the open  glades of Sherwood Forest. Sometimes it is called the Holly tree,  because from the oldest time of which we have any record its boughs  have been used to deck our shrines and churches, and in some parts of  England the country people in December speak of gathering Christmas,  which is the name they give to the Holly, or Holy tree. It is this  evergreen which we oftenest use at Christmas-tide to decorate our  churches, and very lovely the dark green sprays, with their coral  berries, look when twined round the grey stone pillars.    The Holly is looked upon as a second-rate forest tree. It is never  very large, and it usually appears as a thick, tall bush, with many  branches reaching almost to the ground. Sometimes you find it with a  slender, bare trunk, clothed with pale grey bark, and if you look  closely at this bark you will see that it is covered with curious  black markings, as if some strange writing had been traced on it with  a heavy black pen.    This writing is the work of a tiny plant which makes its home on the  Holly stem and spreads in this strange way.    The bark of the young Holly shoots and boughs is pale green and quite  smooth.    The tree requires little sunshine, and it seems to keep all it gets as  every leaf is highly polished and reflects the light like a mirror.  These leaves grow closely on every branch; they are placed  alternately on each side of the twigs, and are oval, with the edges so  much waved that the leaves will not lie flat, but curl on each side of  the centre rib.    The prickly leaves which grow low down on the tree have sharp spines  along the waved edges, and a very sharp spine always grows at the  point of the leaf. But the upper branches are clothed with blunt  leaves which have no spines along the edges; instead there is a pale  yellow line round each leaf, and there is a single blunt spine at the  point.    Sheep and deer are very fond of eating the tough, leathery leaves of  the Holly, and it is believed that the tree clothes its lower branches  in prickly leaves to protect itself from these greedy enemies.    Country people tell you that if branches of smooth Holly are the first  to be brought into the house at Christmas-time, then the wife will be  head of the house all the next year, but if the prickly boughs enter  first, then the husband will be ruler.    The Holly leaves hang on the tree several years, and after they fall  they lie a long time on the ground before the damp soaks through  their leathery skin and makes them decay. You will find Holly leaves  from which all the green part of the leaf has disappeared, leaving a  beautiful skeleton leaf of grey fibre, which is still perfect in every  vein and rib.    The flowers of the Holly bloom in May. They appear in small crowded  clusters between the leaf stalk and the twig, and each flower is a  delicate pale pink on the outside, but is pure white within. There is  a calyx cup edged with four green points, and inside this cup stands a  long white tube, with four white petals at the top. There are four  yellow-headed stamens, and a tiny seed-vessel is hidden inside the  flower tube. Sometimes all these parts will be found complete in a  single flower; sometimes there will be flowers on the same branch  which have stamens and no seed-vessel, and others which have  seed-vessels and no stamens. Perhaps you will find a whole tree on  which not a single seed flower grows. This tree may be laden with  lovely white flowers in spring, but it will bear no berries in winter.  You must have both stamen flowers and seed flowers if the tree is to  produce any fruit.    As summer passes, the seed-vessels, which have had stamen dust  scattered over them, become small green berries and these berries turn  yellow and then change into a deep red, the colour of coral or sealing  wax. The berries cluster round the green stalk, and most beautiful  they are among the glossy dark leaves. Inside each berry there are  four little fruit stones containing seeds, and the birds love to eat  these red berries, which are full of mealy pulp; but remember that  children must never eat the Holly berries, as they are poisonous  except for the birds.    You will find that if the Holly tree has a good crop of berries this  winter there will not be many the following year; the tree seems to  require a year's rest before it can produce a second large crop.    There are some Holly trees with leaves which are shaded with pale yellow  or white-variegated Hollies, we call them. These are greatly prized for  planting in gardens, where the bushes with different-coloured leaves  lend much beauty when all the trees are bare in winter.    The wood of the Holly is too small to be of much use. It is white and  very hard, and when stained black it is largely used instead of ebony,  which is scarce and expensive. The black handles of many of our silver  teapots are made of stained Holly wood, and the slender branches are  good for making walking-sticks and coachmen's whips.          THE FABLE OF THE THREE ELMS          The North Wind spoke to three sturdy elms,        And, \"Now you are dead!\" said he;      \"I have blown a blast till the snow whirled past,        And withered your leaves, and see:      You are brown and old and your boughs are cold!\"        And he sneered at the elm trees three.        The first elm spoke in a hollow tone        (For the snow lay deep and white,)      \"You think we are dead, North Wind?\" he said,        \"Why we sleep--as you sleep at night.      Beneath the snow lie my sturdy roots,        They grip on the friendly earth,      And I rest--till another year!\" said he,        And he shook with a noisy mirth.        The second elm laughed a hearty laugh,        And, \"North Wind,\" he cried in glee,      \"Beneath my bark glows a living spark,        The sap of a healthy tree;      My boughs are bare and my leaves are gone,        But--what have I to fear?      For the winter time is my time of rest        And I sleep till another year!\"        The third elm spoke and his voice was sweet,        And kind as the summery sea;      \"Oh, Wind!\" he said, \"we are far from spring--        The God in whose hand we be      Looks down, with love, from the winter sky,        And sends us His sun to cheer;      If we had no snow there would be no spring--        We rest till another year!\"        The three elms rocked in the stinging blast,        And under the heavy snow      Their roots were warm from the raging storm,        And safe from the winds that blow.      They smiled in their hearts and their leafless boughs        Spread over the frosty way;      For they knew that the God of forest trees        Would watch through each winter day.        The North Wind uttered a frosty sigh,        As the snow blew far and free;      And his weary eyes sought the winter skies,        And, \"Mighty is God!\" said he.      \"To die or live are His gifts to give!\"        And he smiled at the elm trees three.                            Margaret E. Sangster, Jr.          THE PINE AND THE WILLOW    (Japanese Tale)    Mine Morishima      In a beautiful large garden, among many kinds of trees and shrubs,  there stood a tall fine Pine tree, and near to him, and almost as  tall, a graceful Willow.    One dark winter morning the wind blew hard and the clouds showed that  a storm was coming soon.    The Pine felt lonesome, as little children often do and thought he  would talk to the Willow. So he said, \"Friend Willow, your branches  are trembling. I am sorry for you, for I know you are afraid of the  storm that is coming. I wish you were like me. I am so strong nothing  can hurt me. The frost cannot change the colour of my leaves nor the  wind blow them off; occasionally, some old ones may fall on the  ground, but there are always new ones"]]]
