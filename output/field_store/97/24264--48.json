Formalin was added to a portion of the  supernatant in the amount necessary to make the final dilution 0.4 per  cent. This formolization was found to be necessary to inhibit the  action of autolytic enzymes over the period of time required to  complete the investigations. The effects of formolization on the  antigenicity and reactivity of proteins are discussed later. It was  necessary to sterilize and clarify the \"native\" (unformolized)  extracts; this was done by filtration through a Seitz filter. These  \"native\" substances were used only in the early stages of the  investigation (see below). The filtrate was bottled and stored at 2 deg.C.  In the early stages of this investigation clarification of the  formolized extract was accomplished by the same sort of filtration. It  was determined, however, that centrifugation in a refrigerated  centrifuge at high speeds (17,000g) served the same purpose and was  quicker. The formolized extracts were bottled and also stored at 2 deg.C.  (although refrigerated storage of the formolized extracts does not  seem necessary). For each extract the amount of protein present was  determined colorimetrically by the method of Greenberg (1929) with a  Leitz Photrometer.    Species for which extracts were prepared and the protein values of the  extracts are listed in Table 1. Extracts of some species were used  throughout most of the experiment; extracts of others were used only  when needed for purposes of comparison.

Preparation of Antisera    All antisera were produced in rabbits (laboratory stock of  _Oryctolagus cuniculus_). Three methods of injection of antigen were  used in various combinations: intravenous, subcutaneous, and  intraperitoneal. Injection schedules used in the production of each  antiserum are listed in Table 1. Both formolized and \"native\" antigens  were used. Each rabbit received one or more series of four injections,  each injection being administered on alternate days and doubling in  amount: 0.5 ml., 1.0 ml., 2.0 ml., and 4.0 ml. In all but two  instances more than one series of injections was necessary to produce  a useful antiserum. More than two series, however, resulted in little  or no improvement of the reactivity of the antiserum.    The injection-series were separated by intervals of eight days. On the  eighth day after the last injection of each series, 10 ml. of blood  were withdrawn from the main artery of the ear of the rabbit, and the  antiserum was used in a homologous precipitin test to determine its  usefulness. If the antiserum contained sufficient amounts of  antibodies to conduct the projected tests, the rabbit was completely  exsanguinated by cardiac puncture, by using an 18-gauge needle and a  50 ml. syringe. The whole blood was placed in clean test tubes and  allowed to clot. It was allowed to stand at 2 deg.C. for 12 to 18 hours so  that most of the serum would be expressed from the clot. The serum was  then decanted, centrifuged to remove all blood cells, sterilized in a  Seitz filter, bottled in sterile vials, and stored at 2 deg.C. until used.      Methods of Serological Testing    The precipitin reaction is the most successful of the serological  techniques thus far devised for systematic comparisons. The reaction  occurs because antigenic substances introduced into the body of an  animal cause the formation of antibodies which precipitate antigens  when the two are mixed. The antisera which are produced show  quantitative specificities in their actions; therefore, when an  antiserum containing precipitins is mixed with each of several  antigens, the reaction involving the homologous antigen (that used in  the production of the antiserum) is greater than those reactions  involving the heterologous antigens (antigens other than those used in  the production of the antiserum). Furthermore, the magnitudes of the  reactions between the antiserum and the heterologous antigens vary  according to the degrees of similarity of these antigens to the  homologous one.    The method of precipitin testing follows that outlined by Leone  (1949). The Libby (1938) Photronreflectometer was used to measure the  turbidities developed by the interaction of antigen and antiserum.  With this instrument parallel rays of light are passed through the  turbid systems being measured. Light rays are reflected from the  suspended particles to the sensitive plate of a photoelectric cell;  this generates a current of electricity which causes a deflection on a  galvanometer. The deflection is proportional to the amount of  turbidity developed and readings may be taken directly from the scale  of the instrument.    The reaction-cells of the photronreflectometer are designed to operate  with a volume of 2 ml.; therefore, this volume was used in all  testing. In every series of tests the amount of antiserum was held  constant and the amount of antigen was varied. The volume for each  antigen dilution was always 1.7 ml., and to this was added 0.3 ml. of  antiserum to make up a volume of 2 ml.      TABLE 2.--Percentage values obtained from analyses of precipitin    reactions. Numerals represent relative amounts of reaction between    antigens and antisera. Homologous reactions are arbitrarily valued    as 100 per cent, and heterologous reactions are expressed    accordingly. _Comparisons are meaningful only if made within each    horizontal row of  values._      Table headings:      Col A:  _Estrilda amandava_      Col B:  _Poephila guttata_      Col C:  _Piranga rubra_      Col D:  _Richmondena cardinalis_      Col E:  _Spiza americana_      Col F:  _Spinus tristis_      Col G: "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33915"],[0,"Mammals taken Along the Alaska Highway (#8)"],[1," mi.
