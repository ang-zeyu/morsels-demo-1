He opened his arms, and she threw herself into them.    \"You won't go away any more down there, will you Tyl?\" she asked him.    But he did not answer, busy as he was in pressing with his the hand  that trembled so pitifully, and in drying with his lips the hot tears  that fell from the eyes of Nele, like heavy drops of rain in a storm.              XIX      These were the days when the noble city of Ghent refused to pay the  tax which her son, the Emperor Charles, was demanding of her. The  fact was it was impossible to pay, for already the city was drained  of money by the act of Charles himself. But it seemed that the city  was guilty of a great crime, and Charles resolved to go himself and  exact punishment. For to be whipped by her own son is above all things  painful to a mother.    Now, although he was his enemy, Francis Long-Nose was pleased to offer  the Emperor a free passage through the land of France. Charles accepted  the offer, and instead of being held as a prisoner, he was feted and  feasted in right royal fashion. For this is ever a sovereign bond of  union between kings: each to aid the other against their own peoples.    Charles stayed a long time at Valenciennes, and still gave no sign  of his wrath, so that Mother Ghent began to lay aside her fears,  believing that the Emperor her son was going to forgive her, seeing  that she had acted within her rights.    But at length Charles arrived under the walls of the city with 4000  horse, together with the Duke of Alba and the Prince of Orange. The  poorer townsfolk and the small business men wished to prevent  this filial entry into their city, and would have called to arms  80,000 men of the city and of the country round. But the merchants,  the hoogh-poorters, opposed this suggestion, being afraid of the  predominance of the people. Thus Ghent could easily have cut her son  to pieces, him and his 4000 horse. But it seemed she loved him too  dearly, and even the small tradesmen themselves were fast regaining  their trust in him.    Charles also loved the city, but only for the sake of his coffers that  were stored with her money, and which he hoped to store up fuller yet.    Having made himself master of the place, he established military  posts everywhere, and ordered that they should patrol the city night  and day. Then, in great state, he pronounced his sentence.    The chief merchants of the city with cords round their necks  were to appear before him as he sat on his throne, and to make  a formal apology. Ghent itself was declared guilty of the most  costly crimes--of disloyalty, disregard of treaties, disobedience,  sedition, conspiracy, and high treason. The Emperor declared that  all and every privilege--rights, customs, freedoms, and usages--all  were to be abolished and annulled; and he stipulated for the future  too, as though he were God himself, that none of his successors on  coming to the throne should ever observe any one of these usages  again, except only that which was called the Caroline Concession,  as granted by him to the city.    The Abbey of St. Bavon he razed to the ground, and in place he erected  a fortress whence he could pierce with bullets and at his ease his  mother's very heart. Like a good son that is in a hurry for his  inheritance, he confiscated all the riches of Ghent, its revenues,  its houses, its artillery and munitions of war. Finding it still  too well guarded, he destroyed also the Red Tower, the Tower of the  Trou de Crapaud, the Braampoort, the Steenpoort, the Waalpoort, the  Ketelpoort, and many another of its gates, all carved as they were  and sculptured like jewels in stone.    And afterwards, when strangers came to Ghent, they would ask of  one another:    \"Can this indeed be Ghent whose marvels were on the lips of all--this  city so desolated and brought low?\"    And the people of Ghent would make answer:    \"Charles the Emperor has been to the city. He has ravished her  sacred zone.\"    And so saying they would be filled with anger and with shame. And  from the ruins of the city gates did the Emperor take away the bricks  wherewith to build his castle.    For it was his will that Ghent should be utterly impoverished, that  thereby he might make it impossible for her ever to oppose his proud  designs, either by her labour or her industry or wealth; therefore he  condemned her to pay that share of the tax of 400,000 caroluses which  she had previously refused him, and in addition 150,000 caroluses down,  and 6000 more every year in perpetuity. Moreover, in earlier days  the city had lent him money upon which he should have paid interest  at the rate of 150 pounds gross annually. But he made himself remit  by force the notes of credit, and by paying off his debt in this way  he actually enriched himself.    Many and many a time had Ghent cherished him and succoured him, but  now he struck her on the breast as it were with a dagger, looking  for blood, since it seemed he had not there found milk enough.    Last shame of all, he cast his eye upon the bell that is called  Roelandt; and the man who had sounded the alarm thereon, bidding all  the citizens to defend the rights of their city, him he had bound and  hung to the clapper of the bell. And he had no pity upon Roelandt, the  very tongue of his mother, the tongue whereby she spake to all the land  of Flanders, Roelandt the proud bell that sings of herself this song:              When I ring there is a fire          When I peal there is a storm              In the land of Flanders.      And thinking that his mother had too loud a voice he carried away her  bell. And the people of the country round would say that Ghent was  dead, now that her son had wrenched away her tongue with his pincers  of iron.              XX      In those days, which were days of spring, fresh and clear, when  all the earth is in love, Soetkin was chatting by the open window,  and Claes humming a tune, while Ulenspiegel was dressing up the dog  Bibulus Schnouffius in a judge's bonnet. The dog plied his paws as  though desirous of passing judgment upon some one, though in reality  it was simply his way of trying to get rid of his ungainly head-gear.    All at once, Ulenspiegel shut the window and ran back into the  room. Then he jumped upon the chairs and the table, reaching up towards  the ceiling with his hands. Soetkin and Claes soon discovered the cause  of this mad behaviour, for there was a tiny little bird, chirruping  with fear, and cowering against a beam in the recess of the ceiling,  and Ulenspiegel was trying to catch it. He had almost succeeded when  Claes spoke out briskly and asked him:    \"Why are you jumping about like this?\"    \"To catch the bird,\" answered Ulenspiegel, \"and put him in a cage,  and feed him with seeds, and make him sing for me.\"    Meantime the bird, crying in an agony of terror, flew back into the  room, striking its head against the window-pane. Still Ulenspiegel  went on trying to catch it, but suddenly the hand of Claes came down  heavily upon his shoulder.    \"Catch the bird if you can,\" said he, \"put it in a cage, make it sing  for your pleasure; but I also will put you in a cage that is fastened  with strong bars of iron, and I will make you sing too. Then you,  who like nothing better than to run about, will be able to do so no  more; and you will be kept standing in the shade when you are chilly,  and in the sun when you are hot. And, one Sunday, we shall all go out  and forget to give you your food, and we shall not return again till  Thursday, and then maybe we shall find our Tyl all stiff and starved  to death.\"    Soetkin was crying at this picture, but Ulenspiegel started forward.    \"What are you going to do?\" asked Claes.    \"Open the window for the bird to fly out,\" he answered.    And in fact the bird, which was a goldfinch, flew straight out through  the window, and with a cry of joy mounted up into the air like an  arrow, and then alighted upon a neighbouring apple-tree, smoothing  its wings with its beak, ruffling its plumage. And all kinds of abuse  did it sing in its bird language, all directed against Ulenspiegel.    Then Claes said:    \"O son of mine, take care that you never take away its liberty  from either man or beast, for liberty is the greatest good in the  world. Let every one be free, free to go out into the sun when it is  cold, and into the shade when it is hot. And let God give judgment  on His Sacred Majesty, he who, not content with denying freedom of  belief to the people of Flanders, has now put all the noble city of  Ghent into a cage of slavery.\"              XXI      Now Philip was married to Marie of Portugal, and with her he acquired  her lands for the crown of Spain; and together they had a son, Don  Carlos, he who was afterwards called \"the mad\" and \"the cruel.\" And  Philip had no love for his wife.    The Queen was lying-in. She kept her bed, and by her side were the  maids of honour, the Duchess of Alba among them.    Oftentimes did Philip leave his wife to go and see the burning  of heretics. And all the gentlemen and ladies of the Court did  likewise. And thus also did the Duchess of Alba and the other noble  ladies whose duty it was to watch by the Queen in her childbed.    Now at that time the ecclesiastical judges had seized a certain  sculptor of Flanders, a good Roman Catholic, on the following charge:  He had been commissioned, it seems, by a certain monk to carve a wooden  statue of Our Lady for a certain sum, and on the monk refusing to pay  the price which had been agreed between them, the sculptor had slashed  at the face of the image with his chisel, saying that he would rather  destroy his work than let it go at the price of a piece of dirt.    He was straightway denounced by the monk as an iconoclast, tortured  most piteously and condemned to be burnt alive. During the torture  they had scalded the soles of his feet, so that he cried out as he  passed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#8)"],[1,"impertinence of his adversaries,  mingled with some lofty pity for their silly ambition and short-lived  career. She existed for a week in the delightful expectation of his  grace being sent for again, and informed every one in confidence, that  \"these people could not form a cabinet.\" When the tocsin of peace,  reform, and retrenchment sounded, she smiled bitterly; was sorry for  poor Lord Grey of whom she had thought better, and gave them a year,  adding with consoling malice, \"that it would be another Canning affair.\"  At length came the Reform Bill itself, and no one laughed more  heartily than Lady Marney; not even the House of Commons to whom it was  presented.    The bill was thrown out, and Lady Marney gave a grand ball to celebrate  the event, and to compensate the London shopkeepers for the loss of  their projected franchise. Lady Marney was preparing to resume her  duties at court when to her great surprise the firing of cannon  announced the dissolution of Parliament. She turned pale; she was  too much in the secrets of Tadpole and Taper to be deceived as to the  consequences; she sank into her chair, and denounced Lord Grey as a  traitor to his order.    Lady Marney who for six months had been writing to her son at Oxford  the most charming letters, full of fun, quizzing the whole Cabinet,  now announced to Egremont that a revolution was inevitable, that all  property would be instantly confiscated, the poor deluded king led to  the block or sent over to Hanover at the best, and the whole of the  nobility and principal gentry, and indeed every one who possessed  anything, guillotined without remorse.    Whether his friends were immediately to resume power, or whether their  estates ultimately were to be confiscated, the practical conclusion  to Charles Egremont appeared to be the same. Carpe diem. He therefore  pursued his career at Oxford unchanged, and entered life in the year  1833, a younger son with extravagant tastes and expensive habits, with a  reputation for lively talents though uncultivated,--for his acquisitions  at Eton had been quite puerile, and subsequently he had not become a  student,--with many manly accomplishments, and with a mien and visage  that at once took the fancy and enlisted the affections. Indeed a  physiologist would hardly have inferred from the countenance and  structure of Egremont the career he had pursued, or the character which  attached to him. The general cast and expression of his features when in  repose was pensive: an air of refinement distinguished his well-moulded  brow; his mouth breathed sympathy, and his rich brown eye gleamed with  tenderness. The sweetness of his voice in speaking was in harmony with  this organization.    Two years passed in the most refined circles of our society exercised a  beneficial influence on the general tone of Egremont, and may be said  to have finished his education. He had the good sense and the good taste  not to permit his predilection for sports to degenerate into slang; he  yielded himself to the delicate and profitable authority of woman, and,  as ever happens, it softened his manners and brightened his wit. He was  fortunate in having a clever mother, and he appreciated this inestimable  possession. Lady Marney had great knowledge of society, and some  acquaintance with human nature, which she fancied she had fathomed to  its centre; she piqued herself upon her tact, and indeed she was very  quick, but she was so energetic that her art did not always conceal  itself; very worldly, she was nevertheless not devoid of impulse; she  was animated and would have been extremely agreeable, if she had not  restlessly aspired to wit; and would certainly have exercised much  more influence in society, if she had not been so anxious to show it.  Nevertheless, still with many personal charms, a frank and yet, if need  be, a finished manner, a quick brain, a lively tongue, a buoyant spirit,  and a great social position. Lady Marney was universally and extremely  popular; and adored by her children, for indeed she was a mother most  affectionate and true.    When Egremont was four-and-twenty, he fell in love--a real passion. He  had fluttered like others from flower to flower, and like others had  often fancied the last perfume the sweetest, and then had flown away.  But now he was entirely captivated. The divinity was a new beauty; the  whole world raving of her. Egremont also advanced. The Lady Arabella  was not only beautiful: she was clever, fascinating. Her presence was  inspiration; at least for Egremont. She condescended to be pleased  by him: she signalized him by her notice; their names were mentioned  together. Egremont indulged in flattering dreams. He regretted he had  not pursued a profession: he regretted he had impaired his slender  patrimony; thought of love in a cottage, and renting a manor; thought  of living a good deal with his mother, and a little with his brother;  thought of the law and the church; thought once of New Zealand. The  favourite of nature and of fashion, this was the first time in the life  of Egremont, that he had been made conscious that there was something in  his position which, with all its superficial brilliancy, might prepare  for him, when youth had fled and the blaze of society grown dim, a drear  and bitter lot.    He was roused from his reveries by a painful change in the demeanour of  his adored. The mother of the Lady Arabella was alarmed. She liked  her daughter to be admired even by younger sons when they were  distinguished, but only at a distance. Mr Egremont's name had been  mentioned too often. It had appeared coupled with her daughters, even in  a Sunday paper. The most decisive measures were requisite, and they were  taken. Still smiling when they met, still kind when they conversed, it  seemed, by some magic dexterity which even baffled Egremont, that their  meetings every day grew rarer, and their opportunities for conversation  less frequent. At the end of the season, the Lady Arabella selected from  a crowd of admirers equally qualified, a young peer of great estate, and  of the \"old nobility,\" a circumstance which, as her grandfather had only  been an East India director, was very gratifying to the bride.    This unfortunate passion of Charles Egremont, and its mortifying  circumstances and consequences, was just that earliest shock in one's  life which occurs to all of us; which first makes us think. We have all  experienced that disheartening catastrophe, when the illusions first  vanish; and our balked imagination, or our mortified vanity, first  intimates to us that we are neither infallible nor irresistible. Happily  'tis the season of youth for which the first lessons of experience are  destined; and bitter and intolerable as is the first blight of our fresh  feelings, the sanguine impulse of early life bears us along. Our first  scrape generally leads to our first travel. Disappointment requires  change of air; desperation change of scene. Egremont quitted his  country, never to return to it again; and returned to it after a year  and a-half's absence, a much wiser man. Having left England in a serious  mood, and having already tasted with tolerable freedom of the pleasures  and frivolities of life, he was not in an inapt humour to observe, to  enquire, and to reflect. The new objects that surrounded him excited his  intelligence; he met, which indeed is the principal advantage of travel,  remarkable men, whose conversation opened his mind. His mind was worth  opening. Energies began to stir of which he had not been conscious;  awakened curiosity led him to investigate and to read; he discovered  that, when he imagined his education was completed, it had in fact  not commenced; and that, although he had been at a public school and  a university, he in fact knew nothing. To be conscious that you are  ignorant is a great step to knowledge. Before an emancipated intellect  and an expanding intelligence, the great system of exclusive manners  and exclusive feelings in which he had been born and nurtured, began to  tremble; the native generosity of his heart recoiled at a recurrence  to that arrogant and frigid life, alike devoid of sympathy and real  grandeur.    In the early spring of 1837, Egremont re-entered the world, where he had  once sparkled, and which he had once conceived to comprise within its  circle all that could interest or occupy man. His mother, delighted  at finding him again under her roof, had removed some long-standing  coolness between him and his elder brother; his former acquaintance  greeted him with cordiality, and introduced him to the new heroes who  had sprung up during the season of his absence. Apparently Egremont was  not disinclined to pursue, though without eagerness, the same career  that had originally engaged him. He frequented assemblies, and lingered  in clubs; rode in the park, and lounged at the opera. But there was this  difference in his existence, before and since his travels: he was now  conscious he wanted an object; and was ever musing over action, though  as yet ignorant how to act. Perhaps it was this want of being roused,  that led him, it may be for distraction, again to the turf. It was a  pursuit that seemed to him more real than the life of saloons, full of  affectation, perverted ideas, and factitious passions. Whatever might  be the impulse Egremont however was certainly not slightly interested in  the Derby; and though by no means uninstructed in the mysteries of the  turf, had felt such confidence in his information that, with his usual  ardour, he had backed to a considerable amount the horse that ought to  have won, but which nevertheless only ran a second.          Book 1 Chapter 6        Notwithstanding the confidence of Lady St Julians, and her unrivalled  information, the health of the king did not improve: but still it was  the hay fever, only the hay fever.
