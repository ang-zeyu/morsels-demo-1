The chief then took Laudonniere by the hand, telling him that he was  named Satouriona, and pointed out the extent of his dominions, far up  the river and along the adjacent coasts. One of his sons, a man \"perfect  in beautie, wisedome, and honest sobrietie,\" then gave the French  commander a wedge of silver, and received some trifles in return, after  which the voyagers went back to their ships. \"I prayse God continually,\"  says Laudonniere, \"for the great love I have found in these savages.\"    In the morning the French landed again, and found their new friends on  the same spot, to the number of eighty or more, seated under a shelter  of boughs, in festal attire of smoke-tanned deer-skins, painted in many  colors. The party then rowed up the river, the Indians following them  along the shore. As they advanced, coasting the borders of a great marsh  that lay upon their left, the St. John's spread before them in vast  sheets of glistening water, almost level with its flat, sedgy shores,  the haunt of alligators, and the resort of innumerable birds. Beyond the  marsh, some five miles from the mouth of the river, they saw a ridge  of high ground abutting on the water, which, flowing beneath in a deep,  strong current, had undermined it, and left a steep front of yellowish  sand. This was the hill now called St. John's Bluff. Here they landed  and entered the woods, where Laudonniere stopped to rest while his  lieutenant, Ottigny, with a sergeant and a few soldiers, went to explore  the country.    They pushed their way through the thickets till they were stopped by  a marsh choked with reeds, at the edge of which, under a great  laurel-tree, they had seated themselves to rest, overcome with the  summer heat, when five Indians suddenly appeared, peering timidly at  them from among the bushes. Some of the men went towards them with signs  of friendship, on which, taking heart, they drew near, and one of them,  who was evidently a chief, made a long speech, inviting the strangers  to their dwellings. The way was across the marsh, through which they  carried the lieutenant and two or three of the soldiers on their backs,  while the rest circled by a narrow path through the woods. When they  reached the lodges, a crowd of Indians came out \"to receive our men  gallantly, and feast them after their manner.\" One of them brought a  large earthen vessel full of spring water, which was served out to  each in turn in a wooden cup. But what most astonished the French was  a venerable chief, who assured them that he was the father of five  successive generations, and that he had lived two hundred and fifty  years. Opposite sat a still more ancient veteran, the father of the  first, shrunken to a mere anatomy, and \"seeming to be rather a dead  carkeis than a living body.\" \"Also,\" pursues the history, \"his age was  so great that the good man had lost his sight, and could not speak  one onely word but with exceeding great paine.\" In spite of his dismal  condition, the visitors were told that he might expect to live, in the  course of nature, thirty or forty years more. As the two patriarchs sat  face to face, half hidden with their streaming white hair, Ottigny and  his credulous soldiers looked from one to the other, lost in speechless  admiration.    One of these veterans made a parting present to his guests of two young  eagles, and Ottigny and his followers returned to report what they had  seen. Laudonniere was waiting for them on the side of the hill; and now,  he says, \"I went right to the toppe thereof, where we found nothing  else but Cedars, Palme, and Baytrees of so sovereigne odour that Baulme  smelleth nothing like in comparison.\" From this high standpoint they  surveyed their Canaan. The unruffled river lay before them, with its  marshy islands overgrown with sedge and bulrushes; while on the farther  side the flat, green meadows spread mile on mile, veined with countless  creeks and belts of torpid water, and bounded leagues away by the  verge of the dim pine forest. On the right, the sea glistened along  the horizon; and on the left, the St. John's stretched westward between  verdant shores, a highway to their fancied Eldorado. \"Briefly,\"  writes Laudonniere, \"the place is so pleasant that those which are  melancholicke would be inforced to change their humour.\"    On their way back to the ships they stopped for another parley with the  chief Satouriona, and Laudonniere eagerly asked where he had got the  wedge of silver that he gave him in the morning. The chief told him by  signs, that he had taken it in war from a people called Thimagoas, who  lived higher up the River, and who were his mortal enemies; on which  the French captain had the folly to promise that he would join in an  expedition against them. Satouriona was delighted, and declared that, if  he kept his word, he should have gold and silver to his heart's content.    Man and nature alike seemed to mark the borders of the River of May  as the site of the new colony; for here, around the Indian towns, the  harvests of maize, beans, and pumpkins promised abundant food, while the  river opened a ready way to the mines of gold and silver and the stores  of barbaric wealth which glittered before the dreaming vision of the  colonists. Yet, the better to satisfy himself and his men, Laudonniere  weighed anchor, and sailed for a time along the neighboring coasts.  Returning, confirmed in his first impression, he set out with a party of  officers and soldiers to explore the borders of the chosen stream.  The day was hot. The sun beat fiercely on the woollen caps and heavy  doublets of the men, till at length they gained the shade of one  of those deep forests of pine where the dead, hot air is thick with  resinous odors, and the earth, carpeted with fallen leaves, gives no  sound beneath the foot. Yet, in the stillness, deer leaped up on all  sides as they moved along. Then they emerged into sunlight. A meadow was  before them, a running brook, and a wall of encircling forests. The men  called it the Vale of Laudonniere. The afternoon was spent, and the  sun was near its setting, when they reached the bank of the river. They  strewed the ground with boughs and leaves, and, stretched on that sylvan  couch, slept the sleep of travel-worn and weary men.    They were roused at daybreak by sound of trumpet, and after singing a  psalm they set themselves to their task. It was the building of a fort,  and the spot they chose was a furlong or more above St. John's Bluff,  where close to the water was a wide, flat knoll, raised a few feet above  the marsh and the river. [13] Boats came up the stream with laborers,  tents, provisions, cannon, and tools. The engineers marked out the work  in the form of a triangle; and, from the noble volunteer to the meanest  artisan, all lent a hand to complete it. On the river side the defences  were a palisade of timber. On the two other sides were a ditch, and a  rampart of fascines, earth, and sods. At each angle was a bastion, in  one of which was the magazine. Within was a spacious parade, around it  were various buildings for lodging and storage, and a large house  with covered galleries was built on the side towards the river for  Laudonniere and his officers. In honor of Charles the Ninth the fort was  named Fort Caroline.    Meanwhile Satouriona, \"lord of all that country,\" as the narratives  style him, was seized with misgivings on learning these proceedings.  The work was scarcely begun, and all was din and confusion around the  incipient fort, when the startled Frenchmen saw the neighboring height  of St. John's swarming with naked warriors. Laudonniere set his men in  array, and for a season, pick and spade were dropped for arquebuse and  pike. The savage chief descended to the camp. The artist Le Moyne,  who saw him, drew his likeness from memory, a tall, athletic figure,  tattooed in token of his rank, plumed, bedecked with strings of beads,  and girdled with tinkling pieces of metal which hung from the belt which  formed his only garment. He came in regal state, a crowd of warriors  around him, and, in advance, a troop of young Indians armed with spears.  Twenty musicians followed, blowing hideous discord through pipes of  reeds, while he seated himself on the ground \"like a monkey,\" as Le  Moyne has it in the grave Latin of his Brevis Narratio. A council  followed, in which broken words were aided by signs and pantomime; and  a treaty of alliance was made, Laudonniere renewing his rash promise to  aid the chief against his enemies. Satouriona, well pleased, ordered his  Indians to help the French in their work. They obeyed with alacrity,  and in two days the buildings of the fort were all thatched, after the  native fashion, with leaves of the palmetto.    These savages belonged to one of the confederacies into which the native  tribes of Florida were divided, and with three of which the French came  into contact. The first was that of Satouriona; and the second was that  of the people called Thimagoas, who, under a chief named Outina, dwelt  in forty villages high up the St. John's. The third was that of the  chief, cacique, or paracoussy whom the French called King Potanou, and  whose dominions lay among the pine barrens, cypress swamps, and fertile  hummocks westward and northwestward of this remarkable river. These  three confederacies hated each other, and were constantly at war. Their  social state was more advanced than that of the wandering hunter tribes.  They were an agricultural people, and around all their villages were  fields of maize, beans, and pumpkins. The harvest was gathered into a  public granary, and they lived on it during three fourths of the year,  dispersing in winter to hunt among the forests.    They were exceedingly well"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37215"],[0,"The Argus Pheasant (#8)"],[1,"thickly. A  look of implacable hate and passion distorted it. Her eyes sought the  distant hills:    \"_Hanu Token, Hanu Token_, send a young man here to rule Bulungan,\" she  prayed. \"Send a strong man, send a vain man, with a passion for fair  women. Let me dazzle him with my beauty, let me fill his heart with  longing, let me make his brain reel with madness, let me make his body  sick with desire. Let me make him suffer a thousand deaths before he  gasps his last breath and his dripping head is brought to thy temple in  the hills. For the wrongs done Chawatangi's daughter, _Hanu Token_, for  the wrongs done me!\"    With a low sob she fled inland through the cane.          CHAPTER V    SACHSEN'S WARNING      Electric tapers were burning dimly in Governor-General Van Schouten's  sanctum at the _paleis_ that evening as Peter Gross was ushered in. The  governor was seated in a high-backed, elaborately carved mahogany chair  before a highly polished mahogany table. Beside him was the omniscient,  the indispensable Sachsen. The two were talking earnestly in the Dutch  language. Van Schouten acknowledged Peter Gross's entrance with a curt  nod and directed him to take a chair on the opposite side of the table.    At a word from his superior, Sachsen tucked the papers he had been  studying into a portfolio. The governor stared intently at his visitor  for a moment before he spoke.    \"Mynheer Gross,\" he announced sharply, \"your captain tells me your  contract with him runs to the end of the voyage. He will not release  you.\"    \"Then I must fill my contract, your excellency,\" Peter Gross replied.    Van Schouten frowned with annoyance. He was not accustomed to being  crossed.    \"When will you be able to take over the administration of Bulungan,  _mynheer_?\"    Peter Gross's brow puckered thoughtfully. \"In three weeks--let us say  thirty days, your excellency.\"    \"_Donder en bliksem!_\" the governor exclaimed. \"We need you there at  once.\"    \"That is quite impossible, your excellency. I will need help, men that I  can trust and who know the islands. Such men cannot be picked up in a  day.\"    \"You can have the pick of my troops.\"    \"I should prefer to choose my own men, your excellency,\" Peter Gross  replied.    \"Eh? How so, _mynheer_?\" The governor's eyes glinted with suspicion.    \"Your excellency has been so good as to promise me a free hand,\" Peter  Gross replied quietly. \"I have a plan in mind--if your excellency  desires to hear it?\"    Van Schouten's face cleared.    \"We shall discuss that later, _mynheer_. You will be ready to go the  first of June, then?\"    \"On the first of June I shall await your excellency's pleasure here at  Batavia,\" Peter Gross agreed.    \"_Nu!_ that is settled!\" The governor gave a grunt of satisfaction and  squared himself before the table. His expression became sternly  autocratic.    \"Mynheer Gross,\" he said, \"you told us this afternoon some of the  history of our unhappy residency of Bulungan. You demonstrated to our  satisfaction a most excellent knowledge of conditions there. Some of the  things you spoke of were--I may say--surprising. Some touched upon  matters which we thought were known only to ourselves and to our privy  council. But, _mynheer_, you did not mention one subject that to our  mind is the gravest problem that confronts our representatives in  Bulungan. Perhaps you do not know there is such a problem. Or perhaps  you underestimate its seriousness. At any rate, we deem it desirable to  discuss this matter with you in detail, that you may thoroughly  understand the difficulties before you, and our wishes in the matter. We  have requested Mynheer Sachsen to speak for us.\"    He nodded curtly at his secretary.    \"You may proceed, Sachsen.\"    Sachsen's white head, that had bent low over the table during the  governor's rather pompous little speech, slowly lifted. His shrewd gray  eyes twinkled kindly. His lips parted in a quaintly humorous and  affectionate smile.    \"First of all, Vrind Pieter, let me congratulate you,\" he said,  extending a hand across the table. Peter Gross's big paw closed over it  with a warm pressure.    \"And let me thank you, Vrind Sachsen,\" he replied. \"It was not hard to  guess who brought my name to his excellency's attention.\"    \"It is Holland's good fortune that you are here,\" Sachsen declared. \"Had  you not been worthy, Vrind Pieter, I should not have recommended you.\"  He looked at the firm, strong face and the deep, broad chest and massive  shoulders of his protege with almost paternal fondness.    \"To have earned your good opinion is reward enough in itself,\" Peter  Gross asserted.    Sachsen's odd smile, that seemed to find a philosophic humor in  everything, deepened.    \"Your reward, Vrind Pieter,\" he observed, \"is the customary recompense  of the man who proves his wisdom and his strength--a more onerous duty.  Bulungan will test you severely, _vrind_ (friend). Do you believe that?\"    \"Ay,\" Peter Gross assented soberly.    \"Pray God to give you wisdom and strength,\" Sachsen advised gravely. He  bowed his head for a moment, then stirred in his chair and sat up  alertly.    \"_Nu!_ as to the work that lies before you, I need not tell you the  history of this residency. For Sachsen to presume to instruct Peter  Gross in what has happened in Bulungan would be folly. As great folly as  to lecture a dominie on theology.\"    Again the quaintly humorous quirk of the lips.    \"If Peter Gross knew the archipelago half so well as his good friend  Sachsen he would be a lucky man,\" Peter Gross retorted spiritedly.    Sachsen's face became suddenly grave.    \"We do not doubt your knowledge of conditions in our unhappy province,  Vrind Pieter. Nor do we doubt your ability, your courage, or your sound  judgment. But, Pieter--\"    He paused. The clear gray eyes of Peter Gross met his questioningly.    \"--You are young, Vrind Pieter.\"    The governor rose abruptly and plucked down from the wall a  long-stemmed Dutch pipe that was suspended by a gaily colored cord from  a stout peg. He filled the big china bowl of the pipe with nearly a  half-pound of tobacco, touched a light to the weed, and returned to his  chair. There was a pregnant silence in the room meanwhile.    \"How old are you, Vrind Pieter?\" Sachsen asked gently.    \"Twenty-five, _mynheer_,\" Peter Gross replied. There was a pronounced  emphasis on the \"_mynheer_.\"    \"Twenty-five,\" Sachsen murmured fondly. \"Twenty-five! Just my age when I  was a student at Leyden and the gayest young scamp of them all.\" He  shook his head. \"Twenty-five is very young, Vrind Pieter.\"    \"That is a misfortune which only time can remedy,\" Peter Gross replied  drily.    \"Yes, only time.\" Sachsen's eyes misted. \"Time that brings the days  'when strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders shall cease  because they are few, and the grasshopper shall become a burden, and  desire shall fail.' I wish you were older, Vrind Pieter.\"    The old man sighed. There was a far-away look in his eyes as though he  were striving to pierce the future and the leagues between Batavia and  Bulungan.    \"Vrind Gross,\" he resumed softly, \"we have known each other a long time.  Eight years is a long time, and it is eight years since you first came  to Batavia. You were a cabin-boy then, and you ran away from your  master because he beat you. The wharfmaster at Tanjong Priok found you,  and was taking you back to your master when old Sachsen saw you. Old  Sachsen got you free and put you on another ship, under a good master,  who made a good man and a good _zeeman_ (seaman) out of you. Do you  remember?\"    \"I shall never forget!\" Peter Gross's voice was vibrant with emotion.    \"Old Sachsen was your friend then. He has been your friend through the  years since then. He is your friend to-day. Do you believe that?\"    Peter Gross impulsively reached his hand across the table. Sachsen  grasped it and held it.    \"Then to-night you will forgive old Sachsen if he speaks plainly to you,  more plainly than you would let other men talk? You will listen, and  take his words to heart, and consider them well, Pieter?\"    \"Speak, Sachsen!\"    \"I knew you would listen, Pieter.\" Sachsen drew a deep breath. His eyes  rested fondly on his protege, and he let go Gross's hand reluctantly as  he leaned back in his chair.    \"Vrind Pieter, you said a little while ago that old Sachsen knows the  people who live in these _kolonien_ (colonies). His knowledge is  small--\"    Peter Gross made a gesture of dissent, but Sachsen did not let him  interrupt.    \"Yet he has learned some things. It is something to have served the  state for over two-score years in the Netherlands East Indies, first as  _controlleur_, then as resident in Celebes, in Sumatra, in Java, and  finally as secretary to the _gouverneur_, as old Sachsen has. In those  years he has seen much that goes on in the hearts of the black, and the  brown, and the yellow, and the white folk that live in these sun-seared  islands. Much that is wicked, but also much that is good. And he has  seen much of the fevers that seize men when the sun waves hot and the  blood races madly through their veins. There is the fever of hate, and  the fever of revenge, the fever of greed, and the fever to grasp God.  But more universal than all these is the fever of love and the fever of  lust!\"    Peter Gross's brow knit with a puzzled frown. \"What do you mean,  Sachsen?\" he demanded.    Sachsen smoothed back his thinning white hair.    \"I am an old, old man, Vrind Pieter,\" he replied \"Desire has long ago  failed me. The passions that our fiery Java suns breed in men have  drained away. The light that is in a comely woman's eyes, the thrill  that comes at a touch of her warm hand, the quickened pulse-beat at the  feel of her silken hair brushing over one's face--all these things are  ashes and dust to old Sachsen. Slim ankles, plump calves, and full  rounded breasts mean nothing to him. But you, Vrind "]]]
