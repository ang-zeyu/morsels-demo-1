The ladies in the drawing-room  are seated round a large tea-table, drinking tea out of enormous cups,  eating sweet cakes of all kinds, and talking a great deal. The only  person at all out of humor is the fat wife of the fat estate agent. She  is accustomed to be the principal lady in Barnow, but is dethroned for  to-day by the wife of a beggarly Government official--i. e., the new  registrar. For Frau Emilie comes from Lemberg, the capital of the  province, and has brought with her not only the latest fashions in  dress, but also a number of piquant stories. In return for these, she is  of course told all the scandals of Barnow that relate to any lady who  happens not to be present at the time. But that amusement soon comes to  an end, as almost every one of any standing is at Frau Kasimira's this  evening. Then, as luck will have it, Frau Emilie asks to be told the  curious story her husband has heard about from the district judge that  day.    \"I can tell you that story better than any one else,\" answers her  hostess, eagerly. \"We have lived in this house for the last twelve  years, and I know everything that happened. It is very interesting, for  a handsome hussar is the hero of the tale. I'm sure that you can not  have heard anything like it in Lemberg.\"    She then goes on to relate as follows:    \"Well, as you know already, the story is about Esterka, the daughter of  the Jew to whom this house belongs. She was ten years old when we came  here, and tall of her age, with black hair and large blue eyes. She was  scarcely ever to be seen, and never to be heard: she used to sit over  her books all day long, and often far into the night. My daughter  Malvina, who was about the same age, used to ask her to come and play  with her; but the proud little Jewish girl wouldn't accept any of her  invitations, she was so taken up with her reading. It was very foolish  of her, and her uncle Gruenstein was at the bottom of it all. Old  Gruenstein is a very queer sort of man--most disagreeable to have  anything to do with, I should say: he's neither Jew nor Christian--quite  an infidel, in fact; indeed, some people go so far as to say that he can  raise the dead when he likes. Yes, I mean what I say! He can raise the  very dead from their graves! And he was Esterka's teacher. He must have  given her a nice sort of education, for at the end of three years she  was every bit as foolish and godless as himself. To give you an example  of this, let me tell you what happened one very hot August afternoon  when she was with us. You must know that she embroidered beautifully, so  we had asked her to come and help Malvina to finish a bit of work. As we  sat at our sewing the clouds began to come up thick and fast, and soon  afterward there was a terrible storm; it thundered, lightened, and  hailed with the greatest possible fury. My daughter, who, thank God, had  received the education of a good Catholic, began to pray aloud; but the  Jewess remained calm and cool. 'Esther,' I said, 'aren't you afraid of  the judgement of God?'--'A thunder-storm isn't a judgement of God,'  answered the conceited little thing.--'Well, then, what do you call the  lightning?' I asked.--'A discharge of atmospheric electricity,' was her  reply.--'Aren't you afraid of the lightning, then?'--'Oh, yes,' she  answered, 'because we haven't a lightning-conductor on the house!'--I  couldn't possibly allow such godless sentiments to pass unreproved, as  Malvina was there, so I said very sternly: 'You're a little infidel,  child; remember this, the good God guides every flash of  lightning!'--'How can that be?' answered Miss Impudence. 'The poor  peddler, Berisch Katz, was killed by lightning last year, when he was  crossing the open fields, although he was a very good man; and now that  he is dead, his children haven't enough to eat.'--I said nothing more at  the time, but next day, when I happened to see old Moses, I told him the  whole story. 'The child is having a nice sort of education,' I said in  conclusion, 'and if this kind of thing goes on, who knows what the end  of it will be?'--'It shall not go on,' he replied; 'I had made up my  mind to put a stop to it before, and what you tell me determines me to  do so at once.'--He was as good as his word, and took away all of  Esther's books. Then he put her in the shop, and made her weigh the  sugar and sell the groceries. As for Schlome, he turned him out of the  house.    \"All this took place nine years ago last summer. One Sabbath afternoon  in the following autumn Esther came to my daughter and entreated her  with tears to lend her a German book, or else she would die. She said  that her father had taken away every one of her books, and looked after  her so strictly that she couldn't herself get any to take their place.  He did not, however, go so far as to prevent her visiting us. Our  acquaintance was an honor to the girl, and besides that, he knew that I  was a woman of principle. Well, as I said before, Esther wept and  entreated in such a heart-rending manner that I was touched. So I lent  her some German books that I happened to have in the house: Heine's  'Reisebilder,' Klopstock's 'Messiade,' 'Kaiser Joseph,' by Louise  Muehlbach, the new 'Pitaval,' Eichendorf's poems, and the novels of Paul  de Kock. She read them all, devouring them much as a hungry wolf does a  lamb. She read them in the shop whenever her father's back was turned,  and at night when she went to her room. The only book she didn't like  was the first novel of Paul de Kock; she brought it back to me, and  asked me to find her something else. But I hadn't time to do so then, so  I said: 'Read it, child, read it; you'll like it when once you've fairly  begun.' I was right; she liked it so much that she never offered to give  back the second novel, and after the third, she wanted to finish all by  that author before reading anything else. I was able to gratify her, as  we have the whole of his works. She devoured the hundred and eighty  volumes in the course of one winter. For, I can assure you, these Jewish  girls have no moral feeling...!\"    The ladies all agree in regarding this statement as true. The  estate-agent's wife is the only one who does not join in the chorus. For  though she is very fat and rather stupid, she has a good heart.    \"It wasn't right,\" she says very distinctly and very gravely. \"You have  a great deal to answer for.\"    The Frau Kasimira looks at her in silent astonishment. If she were not a  very courteous woman, a woman of the world, and, above all, if it were  not her own house, she would smile sarcastically and shrug her  shoulders. As it is, she contents herself with saying apologetically,  \"Mon Dieu! she was only a Jewess!\"    \"Only a Jewess!\" repeats the chorus of ladies aloud, and also in a  whisper. Many of them laugh as they say ... \"only a Jewess!\"    \"Only a Jewess!\" is echoed in a grave deep voice. The games in the  ante-room, are finished, and the gentlemen have rejoined the ladies  unnoticed. \"You have made a great mistake, madam.\"    It is the doctor of Barnow who speaks, a tall stately man. He is a Jew  by birth. He is hated because of his religion, and feared because of  his power of sarcasm. His position obliges these people to receive him  into their society, and he accepts their invitations because theirs is  the only society to be had in the dull little country town.    \"You have made a mistake,\" he repeats, addressing the estate-agent's  wife. \"You have never been able to throw off the prejudices of your  German home, where people look upon a Jew as a human being. It is very  foolish of you not to have learned to look upon the subject from the  Podolian point of the view!\"    \"Laugh as much as you like,\" says his hostess quickly. \"I still maintain  that an uneducated Jewess has very little moral feeling!\"    \"Yes,\" is the dry answer, \"especially when she has been put through a  course of Paul de Kock--has been given the whole of his works without  exception. But, pray, don't let me interrupt you; go on with your  story.\"    Frau Kasimira continues:    \"Very well; where did I leave off? Oh, I remember now. She had finished  Kock by the spring. I had no more German books to lend her; so she  begged me to subscribe to the Tarnapol lending library for her, and I at  length consented to do so. I didn't like it at all, but she entreated me  to do it so piteously, that I must have had a heart of stone to refuse.  She read every one of the books in the library, beginning with About and  ending with Zschokke. Her father had no suspicion of the truth, and he  never knew it. She used only to read in the night when she went to her  bedroom. The exertion did not hurt her eyes at all. She had most  beautiful eyes, large and blue--blue as the sky. As to her figure, it  was queenly, slender, upright, and rounded. In short, she was  lovely--very lovely. But at the same time she was a silly romantic girl,  who thought that real life was like the novels she used to devour. When  she was sixteen her father told her that he wished her to marry a son of  Moschko Fraenkel from Chorostko, a handsome Jewish lad of about her own  age. She said she would rather die than marry him. But old Freudenthal  isn't a man to jest with. The betrothal took place, and beautiful Esther  sat at the feast pale and trembling as though she were about to die. I  had gone down-stairs to see the ceremony from curiosity. My heart is not  a very soft one, but when I saw Esther looking so miserable, I really  felt for the girl. 'Why are you forcing your daughter to marry against  her will?' I asked the old man. He answered me abruptly, almost rudely,  I thought: 'Pardon me; you don't understand; our ways are different from  your ways. We don't look upon the chicken as wiser than the hen. And,  thank God, we know nothing of love and of all that kind of nonsense. We"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#8)"],[1,"though drawn  through a die-plate. The larva thus assumes a rather strange form. Its  hinder half, which is constantly outside the victim's belly, has the  shape and fulness usual in the larvae of the Digger-wasps, whereas the  front half, which, once it has dived under the skin of the exploited  victim, does not come out again until the time arrives for spinning the  cocoon, tapers off suddenly into a snake-like neck. This front part is  moulded, so to speak, by the narrow entrance-hole made in the skin and  henceforth retains its slender formation. As a matter of fact, a  similar configuration recurs, in varying degrees, in the larvae of the  Digger-wasps whose ration consists of a bulky quarry which takes a  long time to consume. These include the Languedocian Sphex, with her  Ephippiger, and the Hairy Ammophila, with her Grey Worm. There is none  of this sudden constriction, dividing the creature into two disparate  halves, when the victuals consist of numerous and comparatively small  items. The larva then retains its usual shape, being obliged to pass, at  brief intervals, from one joint in its larder to the next.    From the first bite of the mandibles, until the whole head of game is  consumed, the Scolia-larva is never seen to withdraw its head and its  long neck from inside the creature which it is devouring. I suspect the  reason of this persistence in attacking a single point; I even seem  to perceive the need for a special art in the manner of eating. The  Cetonia-larva is a square meal in itself, one large dish, which has to  retain a suitable freshness until the end. The young Scolia, therefore,  must attack with discretion, at the unvarying point chosen by the mother  on the ventral surface, for the entrance-hole is at the exact point  where the egg was fixed. As the nurseling's neck lengthens and dives  deeper, the victim's entrails are nibbled gradually and methodically:  first, the least essential; next, those whose removal leaves yet a  remnant of life; lastly, those whose loss inevitably entails death,  followed very soon by putrefaction.    At the first bites we see the victim's blood oozing through the wound.  It is a highly-elaborated fluid, easy of digestion, and forms a sort of  milk-diet for the new-born grub. The little ogre's teat is the bleeding  paunch of the Cetonia-larva. The latter will not die of the wound,  at least not for some time. The next thing to be tackled is the fatty  substance which wraps the internal organs in its delicate folds. This  again is a loss which the Cetonia can suffer without dying then and  there. Now comes the turn of the muscular layer which lines the skin;  now, that of the essential organs; now, that of the nerve-centres and  the trachean network, whereupon the last gleam of light is extinguished  and the Cetonia reduced to a mere bag, empty but intact, save for the  entrance-hole made in the middle of the belly. From now onwards, these  remains may rot if they will: the Scolia, by its methodical fashion of  consuming its victuals, has succeeded in keeping them fresh to the very  last; and now you may see it, replete, shining with health, withdraw its  long neck from the bag of skin and prepare to weave the cocoon in which  its development will be completed.    It is possible that I may not be quite accurate as to the precise order  in which the organs are consumed, for it is not easy to perceive what  happens inside the exploited larva's body. The ruling feature in this  scientific method of eating, which proceeds from the parts less to the  parts more necessary to preserve a remnant of life, is none the less  obvious. If direct observation did not already to some degree confirm  it, a mere examination of the half-eaten larva would do so in the most  positive fashion.    The Cetonia-larva is at first a plump grub. Drained by the Scolia's  tooth, it gradually becomes limp and wrinkled. In a few days' time it  resembles a shrivelled bit of bacon-fat and then a bag whose two  sides have fallen in. Yet this bit of bacon and this bag have the same  characteristic look of fresh meat as had the grub before it was bitten  into. Despite the persistent nibbling of the Scolia, life continues,  holding at bay the inroads of putrefaction until the mandibles have  given their last bites. Does not this remnant of tenacious vitality in  itself show that the organs of primary importance are the last to be  attacked? Does it not prove that there is a progressive dismemberment  passing from the less essential to the indispensable?    Would you like to see what becomes of a Cetonia-larva when the organism  is wounded in its vital centres at the very beginning? The experiment  is an easy one; and I made a point of trying it. A sewing-needle, first  softened and flattened into a blade, then retempered and sharpened,  gives me a most delicate scalpel. With this instrument I make a fine  incision, through which I remove the mass of nerves whose remarkable  structure we shall soon have occasion to study. The thing is done: the  wound, which does not look serious, has left the creature a corpse, a  real corpse. I lay my victim on a bed of moist earth, in a jar with a  glass lid; in fact, I establish it in the same conditions as those of  the larvae on which the Scoliae feed. By the next day, without changing  shape, it has turned a repulsive brown; presently it dissolves into  noisome putrescence. On the same bed of earth, under the same glass  cover, in the same moist, warm atmosphere, the larvae three-quarters  eaten by the Scoliae retain, on the contrary, the appearance of healthy  flesh.    If a single stroke of my dagger, fashioned from the point of a needle,  results in immediate death and early putrefaction; if the repeated bites  of the Scolia gut the creature's body and reduce it almost to a skin  without completely killing it, the striking contrast between these two  results must be due to the relative importance of the organs injured. I  destroy the nerve-centres and inevitably kill my larva, which is putrid  by the following day; the Scolia attacks the reserves of fat, the blood,  the muscles and does not kill its victim, which will provide it with  wholesome food until the end. But it is clear that, if the Scolia were  to set to work as I did, there would be nothing left, after the first  few bites, but an actual corpse, discharging fluids which would be fatal  to it within twenty-four hours. The mother, it is true, in order to  assure the immobility of her prey, has injected the poison of her sting  into the nerve-centres. Her operation cannot be compared with mine in  any respect. She practises the method of the skilful physiologist who  induces anaesthesia; I go to work like the butcher who chops, cuts and  disembowels. The sting leaves the nerve-centres intact. Deprived  of sensibility by the poison, they have lost the power of provoking  muscular contractions; but who can say that, numbed as they are, they  no longer serve to maintain a faint vitality? The flame is extinguished,  but there is still a glowing speck upon the wick. I, a rough blunderer,  do more than blow out the lamp: I throw away the wick and all is over.  The grub would do the same if it bit straight into the mass of nerves.    Everything confirms the fact: the Scolia and the other Hunting Wasps  whose provisions consist of bulky heads of game are gifted with a  special art of eating, an exquisitely delicate art which saves a remnant  of life in the prey devoured, until it is all consumed. When the prey is  a small one, this precaution is superfluous. Consider, for instance, the  Bembex-grubs in the midst of their heap of Flies. The prey seized upon  is broached on the back, the belly, the head, the thorax, indifferently.  The larva munches a given spot, which it leaves to munch a second,  passing to a third and a fourth, at the bidding of its changing whims.  It seems to taste and select, by repeated trials, the mouthfuls most to  its liking. Thus bitton at several points, covered with wounds, the Fly  is soon a shapeless mass which would putrefy very quickly if the meagre  dish were not devoured at a single meal. Allow the Scolia-grub the same  unlicensed gluttony: it would perish beside its corpulent victim,  which should have kept fresh for a fortnight, but which almost from the  beginning would be no more than a filthy putrescence.    This art of careful eating does not seem easy to practise: at least, the  larva, if ever so little diverted from its usual courses, is no longer  able to apply its talent as a capable trencherman. This will be proved  by experiment. I must begin by observing that, when I spoke of my larva  which turned putrid within twenty-four hours, I adopted an extreme case  for the sake of greater clearness. The Scolia, taking its first bite,  does not and cannot go to such lengths. Nevertheless it behooves us to  enquire whether, in the consumption of the victuals, the initial point  of attack is a matter of indifference and whether the rummaging through  the entrails of the victim entails a determined order, without which  success is uncertain or even impossible. To these delicate questions no  one, I think, can reply. Where science is silent, perhaps the grub will  speak. We will try.    I move from its position a Scolia-grub which has attained a quarter or a  third of its full growth. The long neck plunged into the victim's belly  is rather difficult to extract, because of the need of molesting the  creature as little as possible. I succeed, by means of a little patience  and repeated strokes with the tip of a paint-brush. I now turn the  Cetonia-larva over, back uppermost, at the bottom of the little hollow  made by pressing my finger in the layer of mould. Lastly, I place the  Scolia on its victim's back. Here is my grub under the same conditions  as just now, with this difference, that the back and not the belly of  its victim is presented to its"]]]
