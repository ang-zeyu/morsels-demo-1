I always liked her best when she wore  great big purple pansies on her hat. Now for the jimpson.\"    Jimpson weeds abounded by the roadside. Bee filled the bottom of the  buggy with them, and then drove home. Ignoring Joel's surprised looks  the girl reached the house without meeting any one else, and went  directly to her room.    \"I won't go down to dinner,\" was her thought. \"I'll burst upon father in  the morning like a new being. Won't he be surprised?\"          Chapter VI    A Night of Misery        \"Man on the dubious waves of error tossed,      His ship half foundered and his compass lost,      Sees, far as human optics many command,      A sleeping fog, and fancies it dry land:      Spreads all his canvas, every sinew plies,      Pants for it, aims at it, enters it, and dies.\"        --_Truth. Cowper._      The night was warm, and Beatrice found her poultice exceedingly  uncomfortable. She had heaped the leaves on a clean cloth, mashed them  to a pulp, spread the mass between two other cloths through which were  cut small holes for the eyes and nostrils, and then, with a resolution  worthy of a better cause, bound the whole upon her face.    The juices of the crushed leaves soon wet the mask through and through,  making her face wet and sticky. The greenish odor of the weed was  sickening, and the poor child found her condition unpleasant to say the  least. She tossed restlessly from side to side in the vain effort to  find sleep, but slumber fled her call. The night wore on, and the mask  became so oppressive that it seemed to stifle her.    \"I can not stand it,\" she exclaimed at last, springing out of bed. \"I  can not! I shall smother.\"    She reached up to tear off the bandages that bound the suffocating thing  on, but paused in the act.    \"I must not give up,\" she said aloud. \"I should be sorry in the morning  if I did. I must stand it somehow, even though the night does seem as if  it would never end. I must bear it.\"    Fortified by this determination she drew a chair to the window and tried  to distract her thoughts by humming softly to herself.    \"I know,\" she thought, tiring of this pastime. \"I'll see if I can't make  up some poetry, and forget all about the horrid thing. If it were not  for father I would not stand it for a second. Let me see! I have it:        \"Bee was an ugly duckling,        And Adele a princess fair;      Bee's locks were black and heavy,        Adele had yellow hair.    \"Pshaw! That's sing-songy. I'll try again:        \"Adele's hair is sunny and golden,        Mine is as black as sin;      For there's nothing yellow about me        Excepting my yellow skin.    \"Dear, dear! It's most as hard to make rhymes as to be beautiful. How  long the night is!\"    She arose and paced the floor restlessly. Eleven, then twelve o'clock  struck. In all her life she had never spent a night without sleep. A  first experience is very trying, and the hours seem interminable. At two  o'clock she was about as miserable as she could well be, and only the  thought of her father made her hold to her determination to stick it  out. Suddenly she remembered that she had left a book she was reading on  the library table.    \"I'll go down and get it,\" she ejaculated, pleased with the distraction.  \"If anything will make me forget myself it's the 'Woman in White.'\"    Suiting the action to the word she lighted a small night lamp, and  glided softly down the stairs to the library. Turning the knob gently  she opened the door, stepped across the threshold, and then--It was a  wonder that she did not shriek aloud; for there in the room were two  men, one of whom held a bag into which the other was putting the  household silver which was piled on the table in front of them. They  wore slouch hats drawn well down over their faces, and were working by  the light of a dark lantern.    Beatrice entered so quietly that they did not notice her and for a  second she stood unobserved, too frightened to speak. Then something  made one of the men look up. A look of terror flashed into his eyes and  his face whitened. The other turned to see what his companion was doing,  but at sight of the figure that stood in the doorway he uttered a yell,  dropped the bag, and ran for the window.    \"It's a sperrit, Bill,\" he cried wildly. \"Come on, man!\"    Bill needed no second bidding. He glanced once more at the startling  apparition and followed his comrade.    In truth Beatrice did present rather a ghostly appearance. She was clad  in a long white night gown; her yellow hair bushed in all its bleached  glory around the white mask through which her eyes gleamed with feverish  brilliancy. The greenish juice of the jimpson had permeated the cloth,  giving it just enough of a stain to be ghastly under the rays of the  lamp. As the men gained the window the girl, hardly conscious of what  she was doing, moved toward them. Uttering cries of fear the fellows  jumped through and made a dash for the road. Doors began to open and  close, and Bee knew that the household was aroused. It brought her to  her senses quickly. She had been so frightened that she had not fully  grasped the meaning of the scene through which she had just passed, but  now it flashed upon her that it was her beautifying mask that had  terrified the burglars.    \"Father must not see me,\" she thought with an hysterical giggle. \"I  should frighten him, too.\"    There was not a moment to lose, so setting her lamp upon the table she  crept under the couch and drew back as far as she could, just as her  father ran in, followed by Aunt Fanny, Joel her husband, and old Uncle  Billy, the gardener.    \"Well, upon my word!\" exclaimed Dr. Raymond. \"It's burglars. See, here  is the silver. What made them leave it? Something scared them. What  could it have been?\"    \"'Twuz a hant,\" cried Aunt Fanny, ashy with terror. \"Didn't you heah 'em  say 'twuz a hant?\"    \"It certainly sounded that way, but that is nonsense of course. Joel, do  you come with me, and we will search the grounds. Uncle Billy, go at  once to the stable and see if everything is all right there. Aunt Fanny  will look after the house.\"    \"Lawsie, Massa doctah, yer ain't a gwine ter leab me heah, is yer?\"  queried Aunt Fanny fearfully.    \"Why, there is nothing to hurt you. Come on, Joel.\"    Dr. Raymond leaped through the window, followed by Joel, while Uncle  Billy left for the stable. Aunt Fanny, left alone, began to soliloquize  audibly:    \"Hant, eh? I spec' hit's a hant. Dis house dun bin shet up too long fer  it not to be a hant. Dis heah chile ain't a gwine ter stay in no house  wid a hant. No, sah; she a gwine ter leab shore yer bo'n. She--\"    \"Aunt Fanny,\" spoke Bee in muffled tones.    \"Good Lawd,\" cried Aunt Fanny, starting up. \"Hit's the hant. Lawd, Lawd,  spar dis niggah! You doesn't want no ole worman like me. You--\"    \"Hush, Aunt Fanny! It's only Bee. Don't you know me?\"    Beatrice crept out of her hiding place and arose to her feet. Aunt Fanny  gave a suppressed cry and sank back in her chair, staring at the girl in  open-eyed wonder.    \"You, you ain't no Miss Bee,\" she gasped.    \"Yes, I am. I just had my hair fixed at the hairdresser's this  afternoon, and I have on that jimpson poultice you told me about. I came  down stairs to get a book and frightened the robbers away. I want to go  upstairs now before father comes back so he won't see me.\"    \"Yas; go on up stairs,\" said Aunt Fanny severely, now completely  reassured. \"Yer pa mustn't see you like dat. He won't 'prove ob no sech  doin's, an' I doesn't eider. Yaller ha'r! Looks like flax! No'm; yer pa  oughtn't ter see yer.\"    \"Then don't say a word about seeing me,\" cautioned Bee, turning to go.  \"You won't, will you?\"    \"I ain't gwine ter say nuffin'. 'Tain't none ob my lookout ef yer wants  ter spile yer ha'r. I ain't gwine ter hab nuffin' ter do wid hit,\"  returned the negress with dignity.    So, feeling very much like a culprit, Bee stole upstairs. Presently she  heard her father re-enter the house, and soon there came a rap on her  door.    \"What is it?\" she asked from under the cover which, girl like, she had  drawn over her as soon as she was safely in bed.    \"Are you all right, Beatrice?\" came her father's voice.    \"Yes father.\"    \"Don't be alarmed, but--\" Dr. Raymond hesitated, evidently considering  whether it would be best to tell her about the intruders. \"You are not  nervous, are you?\"    \"No----o;\" answered Bee weakly. She was.    She would have liked to have somebody cuddle her for a time, but--there  was that awful mask.    \"If you should be disturbed about anything, Beatrice, just call me. I  shall be in the next room, where I shall read for the remainder of the  night.\"    \"Thank you, father,\" said the girl gratefully. \"I was afraid, but I  won't be now.\"    \"Then good night.\"    \"Good night, father,\" replied the maiden who little guessed that her  father went away from her door wondering and perplexed that she did not  come out to speak with him, and to find what was the matter.    Her father's near presence brought so much of comfort to Bee's heart  that she found herself forgetting all about the discomfort of the  jimpson, and after a time she fell into a troubled sleep.          Chapter VII    The Result of Imitation        \"We are much bound to them that do succeed;      But, in a more pathetic sense, are bound      To such as fail.\"        --_Jean Ingelow._      It was morning. The long night with its wretchedness and discomfort had  passed, and the bright sunshine full of cheer streamed into the room,  athwart the bed where Beatrice lay, her features still hidden under the  beautifying mask. She stirred uneasily and then opened her eyes.    \"Why, it's morning,\" she exclaimed, jumping up briskly. \"Thank goodness,  I can take off this horrible thing at last. I ought to be fair as a lily  after all I've gone through. My, my how funny my face feels!\" She untied  the fastenings "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33434"],[0,"The Squirrels and other animals (#8)"],[1,"up more room than three or  four of us.\"    \"What a story! It is you Softsides, that want to have half the nest for  yourself.\"    \"Yes,\" squeaked sister Sleek, \"and he has almost scratched my poor eye  out,--the cross creature! only because I asked him to let me suck when  he had had enough, and he knew how dreadfully thirsty I was.\"    \"Be quiet children, will you?\" said mamma; \"and let me go to sleep. You  forget what a terrible headache I have, and how tired I am with running  away from that frightful weasel that chased me almost to death this  morning. I should like to know what you would have done if he had  caught me! Now mind! if I hear any more quarrelling, as surely as a  grain of wheat has a husk, I will kick some of you out of the nest, and  let the weasel or the owl make a meal of you.\"    This little specimen of a family quarrel, which took place when my  brothers and sisters and myself were a few days old, and were not so  large as hazel-nuts, is the earliest circumstance of my life of which I  have any recollection. At this time we were eight in number, and though  all of the same age, I was much the smallest and weakest of the brood,  for which reason I suppose they called me \"Mini-mus,\" or \"the little  mouse.\" My brothers and sisters despised me so for my poor health, and  were so cross and tyrannical, that I verily believe I should have  perished in infancy if my mother had not taken pity on me, and allowed  me to suck sometimes out of my turn. The truth is, I was rather a  favourite with my dear mamma; why, I cannot imagine, for I was a  miserable looking little object, and was often very cross and rude to  her. But since I have seen more of the world, I find that mothers of  your species, my dear mistress, often show the strongest attachment to  those children who are the most worthless in mind and body, and the  least deserving of their affection.    Well! thanks to my dear mother's care, I got through my infancy pretty  well, though I am still much smaller than the rest of my family. But if  you could have seen my poor brother Softsides! oh, he was a noble  animal! Will you believe it? he was nearly twice my size, and such a  runner and leaper! He made nothing of jumping up to our nest at one  bound, without taking the trouble to climb up in the usual way. But I  must leave Softsides for the present, and tell you what sort of a house  our careful mother had provided for us.    It was built on the top of a thistle at a little distance from the  ground, and was nicely sheltered from the wind and rain by a high close  hedge. It was as round as a ball, and was made entirely of the blades  of grass and small straws, carefully woven together like basket-work,  while the inside was as smooth and warm as possible; for there was only  one very small opening, and even that was closed at night, and in the  daytime when the weather was cold. A most delightfully warm, snug house  it was, I assure you; but as we increased in size, it became rather too  small for us, and, as I have already mentioned, we sometimes squabbled  a little for want of room. Indeed I once heard mamma saying to herself,  when she thought we were all asleep, \"Well, if I had known that I  should have had such a large family I would have built a bigger house.\"  Now you must know that she was only one year old herself, and we were  her first brood of young ones. But though this was the first nest she  had ever made, she had shown great judgment in choosing a situation,  which was not, as is usually the case with our tribe, in a corn-field,  where both the nests and the inhabitants are often destroyed by the  reapers. Fearful of this dreadful disaster, our mother had built her  nest on a grassy bank, in an unfrequented meadow, in which there was no  public path, and where a few quiet sheep were our only companions. The  field adjoining ours was a wheat-field, and so we had an abundant  supply of food on the other side of the hedge.    For the first week or two we never left the nest; but mamma soon began  to feed us with seeds, and when our teeth were too weak to nibble hard  grains, she brought us the soft, unripe wheat, which was delicious  juicy food for tender infants.    Never shall I forget the terrible fright I was in the first time I  ventured to leave the nest, and clamber down the thistle-stalk to the  ground! My brothers and sisters had been down the day before, and  laughed at my timidity; and then they boasted that they had scrambled  up the bank, and looked through the hedge, into the wheat-field, where  they had seen the reapers at work; and they told me that they had been  terribly frightened by the barking of a large dog. But Softsides said  that _he_ was not frightened a bit, and that he only came back to the  nest because he wanted his dinner; and he declared that he would fight  the dog the next time he saw him.    Then they told me that they had seen a little girl in the wheat-field,  gathering flowers, and that they had heard her sing most  divinely--something about \"Trip with me,\" and \"the moon shining  bright.\" And Softy said that he had learned part of the song, and that  if we would give over prating so, and would listen to him, he would  sing it as sweetly as the little girl did. So he sat up on his hinder  parts, and began, \"Trip with me, trip with me,\" but he made such a  funny whistling noise through his long front teeth, that we all laughed  till we cried. Then brother Softsides was angry, and bit my ear till I  cried most bitterly, without laughing at all.    The next day, with the help of mamma, I managed to get down to the  ground, and to climb up the bank; and in the wheat-field was the little  girl again, singing her pretty song, and gathering wild-flowers in the  hedge. But either because she had had more practice in singing than  Softy, or because her front teeth were not so long as his, her  performance was much more pleasing, to my ears at least, and I did not  feel at all inclined to laugh at her. Presently, another little girl,  who had been all the morning gleaning, came up to her, crying, and  complaining that somebody had stolen a large bunch of wheat that she  had collected and hid in a corner of the field. Then we saw that the  young lady with the sweet voice had a sweet disposition also, for she  gave the little gleaner her last sixpence, and sent her home as happy  as a bird.    [Illustration: THE HARVEST-MICE. Page 134.]    I was dreadfully tired with this expedition, and was quite lame for  several days after, with a thorn in my left hind-foot, but at last  mamma sucked it out for me. When it got well, I took courage to leave  the nest again, and joined my brothers and sisters in their games of  play, among the high grass, at the foot of the thistle, while mamma  would sit on the nest, keeping watch lest some enemy should approach.  As we became stronger and more courageous, we rambled further from  home, and when the distance was not too great, I generally joined the  party. All my family were now very kind to me, and I hope that I was  less pettish in my behaviour to them, for mamma had convinced us how  silly and wicked it is for brothers and sisters to quarrel with each  other.    And now I must tell you of the dreadful fate of brother Softsides. Poor  fellow! he was very vain of his running and leaping abilities, and at  last he perished miserably by his rashness. One fine afternoon, when we  were more than half grown, Softsides, Tiney, and Sleek set off for a  very long ramble along the hedge, nearly to the bottom of the field. I  was too weak to join the party, but sister Sleek gave me a particular  account of this unfortunate expedition. Softy was in very high spirits,  and was trying to make Tiney lay wagers of so many grains of corn,  about the distance he could leap. Fine fun they had, jumping and  tumbling about; but at last they came to a place where some labourers  had been dining, and had left a basket, with bread and cheese in it,  and a small keg of beer, or cider. Our party made a glorious meal on  the cheese, which was quite new food to them; and then Softsides said  he would try to leap on to the keg, to enjoy the beautiful prospect.  But sister Sleek begged him not to make the attempt, saying that she  was sure he would come to some mischief if he did. Now I must tell you,  that Sleek, though very demure and quiet in her manners, was considered  to be much the most sensible of all our family; and indeed mamma, who  was confined at home that day by a sprained ankle, had made her join  this exploring party, in the hopes that she would keep the boys out of  mischief.    \"Now what harm can there possibly be in trying to jump on to this keg,  I should like to know?\" said Softsides; \"but sister Sleek, or _Meek_,  if you like that name better, you are always spoiling my fun.\"    \"You may call me what name you like, Softy,\" replied his sister, \"but I  feel quite convinced in my own mind that if you don't take my advice,  something dreadful will happen.\"    And sure enough something dreadful did happen--something very dreadful  indeed: for poor brother Softsides, taking a run of about a couple of  feet, jumped on to the fatal keg, pretty easily, but, alas! he never  jumped down again! for the heat of the sun had forced the bung out,  though we could not see this from the ground. Poor Softy saw it, when  too late, for he could not save himself from tumbling down headlong  into the keg, where he was soon drowned, while his brother and sister  were horrified by hearing him screaming for assistance, which they  could not possibly give him, and lamenting that he had not taken  Sleek's advice.    So Tiney and his sister came back, frightened and sorrowful enough, and  our cheerful home became a house of mourning. Mamma was in hysterics  all night, and I verily thought we should have lost her. But sister  Sleek, who knew something of the virtues of herbs, sent two of the"]]]
