Here is an insect exploring not  the stony exterior of the mason's dwelling, but the surface of cocoons  woven of silk. The explorer has never found herself placed in such  circumstances, nor has any of her race before her, every cocoon, under  normal conditions, being protected by a surrounding wall. No matter:  despite the profound difference in the surfaces, the insect does not  waver. Warned by a special sense, an undecipherable riddle to ourselves,  it knows that the object of its search lies hidden under this unfamiliar  casing. The sense of smell has already been shown to be out of the  question; that of sight is now eliminated in its turn.    That she should bore through the cocoons of the Stelis, a parasite of  the mason bee, does not surprise me at all: I know how indifferent my  bold visitor is to the nature of the victuals destined for her family. I  have noticed her presence in the homes of bees differing greatly in  size and habits: Anthophorae, Osmiae, Chalicodomae, Anthidia. The Stelis  exploited on my table is one victim more; and that is all. The interest  does not lie there. The interest lies in the maneuvers of the insect,  which I am able to follow under the most favorable conditions.    Bent sharply at right angles, like a couple of broken matches, the  antennae feel the cocoon with their tips alone. The terminal joint is  the home of this strange sense which discerns from afar what no eye  sees, no scent distinguishes and no ear hears. If the point explored be  found suitable, the insect hoists itself on tiptoe so as to give full  scope to the play of its mechanism; it brings the tip of the belly  a little forward; and the entire ovipositor--inoculating-needle and  scabbard--stands perpendicular to the cocoon, in the center of the  quadrilateral described by the four hind legs, an eminently favorable  position for obtaining the maximum effect. For some time, the whole of  the awl bears on the cocoon, feeling all round with its point, groping  about; then, suddenly, the boring needle is released from its sheath,  which falls back along the body, while the needle strives to make its  entrance. The operation is a difficult one. I see the insect make a  score of attempts, one after the other, without succeeding in piercing  the tough wrapper of the Stelis. Should the instrument not penetrate,  it retreats into its sheath and the insect resumes its scrutiny of the  cocoon, sounding it point by point with the tips of its antennae. Then  further thrusts are tried until one succeeds.    The eggs are little spindles, white and gleaming like ivory, about  two-thirds of a millimeter in length. They have not the long, curved  peduncle of the Leucospis' eggs; they are not suspended from the  ceiling of the cocoon like these, but are laid without order around  the fostering larva. Lastly, in a single cell and with a single mother,  there is always more than one laying; and the number of eggs varies  considerably in each. The Leucospis, because of her great size, which  rivals that of her victim, the Bee, finds in each cell provisions enough  for one and one alone. When, therefore, there is more than one set of  eggs in any one cell, this is due to a mistake on her part and not a  premeditated result. Where the whole ration is required for the meals  of a single grub, she would take good care not to install several if  she could help it. Her competitor is not called upon to observe the  same discretion. A Chalicodoma grub gives the dwarf the wherewithal to  portion a score of her little ones, who will live in common and in all  comfort on what a single son of the giantess would eat up by himself.  The tiny boring engineer, therefore, always settles a numerous family  at the same banquet. The bowl, ample for a dozen or two, is emptied in  perfect harmony.    Curiosity made me count the brood, to see if the mother was able to  estimate the victuals and to proportion the number of guests to the  sumptuousness of the fare provided. My notes mention fifty-four larvae  in the cell of a masked Anthophora (Anthophora personata). No other  census attained this figure. Possibly, two different mothers had laid  their eggs in this crowded habitation. With the Mason bee of the Walls,  I see the number of larvae vary, in different cells, between four  and twenty-six; with the mason bee of the Sheds, between five and  thirty-six; with the three-horned Osmia, who supplied me with the  largest number of records, between seven and twenty-five; with the  blue Osmia (Osmia cyanea, KIRB.), between five and six; with the Stelis  (Stelis nasuta), between four and twelve.    The first return and the last two seem to point to some relation between  the abundance of provisions and the number of consumers. When the mother  comes upon the bountiful larva of the masked Anthophora, she gives it  half-a-hundred to feed; with the Stelis and the blue Osmia, niggardly  rations both, she contents herself with half-a-dozen. To introduce into  the dining room only the number of boarders that the bill of fare will  allow would certainly be a most deserving performance, especially as the  insect is placed under very difficult conditions to judge the contents  of the cell. These contents, which lie hidden under the ceiling, are  invisible; and the insect can derive its information only from the  outside of the nest, which varies in the different species. We  should therefore have to admit the existence of a particular power  of discrimination, a sort of discernment of the species, which is  recognized as large or small from the outward aspect of its house. I  refuse to go to this length in my conjectures, not that instinct seems  to me incapable of such feats, but because of the particulars obtained  from the three-horned Osmia and the two mason bees.    In the cells of these three species, I see the number of larvae put out  to nurse vary in so elastic a fashion that I must abandon all idea of  proportionate adjustment. The mother, without troubling unduly whether  there be an excess or a dearth of provisions for her family, has filled  the cells as her fancy prompted, or rather according to the number of  ripe ovules contained in her ovaries at the time of the laying. If food  be over-plentiful, the brood will be all the better for it and will grow  bigger and stronger; if food be scarce, the famished youngsters will not  die, but will remain smaller. Indeed, with both the larva and the full  grown insect, I have often observed a difference in size which varies  according to the density of the population, the members of a small  colony being double the size of their overcrowded neighbors.    The grubs are white, tapering at both ends, sharply segmented and  covered all over their bodies with a coat of fine, soft hairs which is  invisible except under the lens. The head consists of a little knob much  smaller in diameter than the body. In this head, the microscope reveals  mandibles consisting of fine spikes of a tawny red, which spread into a  wide, colorless base. Deprived of any indentation, incapable of chewing  anything between their awl-shaped ends, these two tools serve at best to  fix the grub slightly at some point of the fostering larva. Useless for  carving, therefore, the mouth is a pure osculatory sucker, which drains  the provisions by a process of exudation through the skin. We see here  repeated what the Anthrax and the Leucospis have already shown us:  the gradual exhaustion of a victim which the parasite consumes without  killing it.    It is a curious spectacle even after that of the Anthrax. We have here  twenty or thirty starvelings, all with their mouths pressed, as for a  kiss, to the body of the plump larva, which, from day to day, fades and  shrinks without the least appreciable wound, thus keeping fresh until  reduced to a shriveled slough. If I disturb the gluttonous swarm, all,  with a sudden recoil, let go, drop off and flounder around the foster  mother. They are no less prompt in resuming their savage kisses. I need  not add that neither at the point where they leave off nor at the point  where they recommence is there the faintest trace of liquid. The oily  exudation occurs only when the pump is at work. To linger over this  strange method of feeding is superfluous after what I have said about  the Anthrax.    The appearance of the full grown insect takes place at the beginning of  summer, after nearly a whole year's stay in the invaded dwelling. The  large number of inhabitants of one and the same cell led me to think  that the work of deliverance ought to present a certain interest. They  are all equally anxious to clear the walls of the prison at the earliest  possible moment and to come forth into the great festival of the sun: do  they all at the same time, in a confused horde, attack the ceiling which  has to be pierced? Is the work of deliverance arranged in the general  interest? Or is individual selfishness the only rule? These are the  questions which observation will answer.    A little in advance of the proper season, I transfer each family into  a short glass tube, which will represent the natal cell. A good, thick  cork, quite a centimeter deep, is the obstacle to be pierced for  an outlet. Well, instead of the mad haste and the ruinous lack of  organization which I expected to find, my broods show me in their glass  prison an exceedingly well regulated workshop. One insect, one only,  works at perforating the cork. Patiently, with its mandibles, grain by  grain, it digs a tunnel the width of its body. The gallery is so narrow  that, in order to return to the tube, the worker has to move backwards.  It is a slow process; and it takes hours and hours to dig the hole, a  hard job for the frail miner.    Should her fatigue become too great, the excavator leaves the forefront  and mingles with the crowd, to polish and dust herself.

But he's to be kep' quiet until old Pine comes down.\"    She became authoritative.    \"Come, Miles, let me go in.\"    \"Don't ask me, miss. It's against orders, and--\"    \"Against orders? Why, you were blustering about shooting people just  now.\"    The badgered Miles grew angry. \"Was I? Bluster or no bluster, you don't  go in.\" She turned away. \"Oh, very well. If this is all the thanks I get  for wasting my time down here, I shall go on deck again.\"    Miles became uneasy.    \"There are plenty of agreeable people there.\"    Miles took a step after her.    \"Mr. Frere will let me go in, I dare say, if I ask him.\"    Miles swore under his breath.    \"Dom Mr. Frere! Go in if yer like,\" he said. \"I won't stop yer, but  remember what I'm doin' of.\"    She turned again at the foot of the ladder, and came quickly back.    \"That's a good lad. I knew you would not refuse me\"; and smiling at the  poor lad she was befooling, she passed into the cabin.    There was no lantern, and from the partially-blocked stern windows came  only a dim, vaporous light. The dull ripple of the water as the ship  rocked on the slow swell of the sea made a melancholy sound, and the  sick man's heavy breathing seemed to fill the air. The slight noise  made by the opening door roused him; he rose on his elbow and began to  mutter. Sarah Purfoy paused in the doorway to listen, but she could make  nothing of the low, uneasy murmuring. Raising her arm, conspicuous by  its white sleeve in the gloom, she beckoned Miles.    \"The lantern,\" she whispered, \"bring me the lantern!\"    He unhooked it from the rope where it swung, and brought it towards her.  At that moment the man in the bunk sat up erect, and twisted himself  towards the light. \"Sarah!\" he cried, in shrill sharp tones. \"Sarah!\"  and swooped with a lean arm through the dusk, as though to seize her.    The girl leapt out of the cabin like a panther, struck the lantern out  of her lover's hand, and was back at the bunk-head in a moment. The  convict was a young man of about four-and-twenty. His hands--clutched  convulsively now on the blankets--were small and well-shaped, and the  unshaven chin bristled with promise of a strong beard. His wild black  eyes glared with all the fire of delirium, and as he gasped for breath,  the sweat stood in beads on his sallow forehead.    The aspect of the man was sufficiently ghastly, and Miles, drawing  back with an oath, did not wonder at the terror which had seized Mrs.  Vickers's maid. With open mouth and agonized face, she stood in the  centre of the cabin, lantern in hand, like one turned to stone, gazing  at the man on the bed.    \"Ecod, he be a sight!\" says Miles, at length. \"Come away, miss, and shut  the door. He's raving, I tell yer.\"    The sound of his voice recalled her.    She dropped the lantern, and rushed to the bed.    \"You fool; he's choking, can't you see? Water! give me water!\"    And wreathing her arms around the man's head, she pulled it down on her  bosom, rocking it there, half savagely, to and fro.    Awed into obedience by her voice, Miles dipped a pannikin into a small  puncheon, cleated in the corner of the cabin, and gave it her; and,  without thanking him, she placed it to the sick prisoner's lips. He  drank greedily, and closed his eyes with a grateful sigh.    Just then the quick ears of Miles heard the jingle of arms. \"Here's the  doctor coming, miss!\" he cried. \"I hear the sentry saluting. Come away!  Quick!\"    She seized the lantern, and, opening the horn slide, extinguished it.    \"Say it went out,\" she said in a fierce whisper, \"and hold your tongue.  Leave me to manage.\"    She bent over the convict as if to arrange his pillow, and then glided  out of the cabin, just as Pine descended the hatchway.    \"Hallo!\" cried he, stumbling, as he missed his footing; \"where's the  light?\"    \"Here, sir,\" says Miles, fumbling with the lantern. \"It's all right,  sir. It went out, sir.\"    \"Went out! What did you let it go out for, you blockhead!\" growled the  unsuspecting Pine. \"Just like you boobies! What is the use of a light if  it 'goes out', eh?\" As he groped his way, with outstretched arms, in the  darkness, Sarah Purfoy slipped past him unnoticed, and gained the upper  deck.          CHAPTER V. THE BARRACOON.        In the prison of the 'tween decks reigned a darkness pregnant with  murmurs. The sentry at the entrance to the hatchway was supposed to  \"prevent the prisoners from making a noise,\" but he put a very liberal  interpretation upon the clause, and so long as the prisoners refrained  from shouting, yelling, and fighting--eccentricities in which they  sometimes indulged--he did not disturb them. This course of conduct was  dictated by prudence, no less than by convenience, for one sentry was  but little over so many; and the convicts, if pressed too hard, would  raise a sort of bestial boo-hoo, in which all voices were confounded,  and which, while it made noise enough and to spare, utterly precluded  individual punishment. One could not flog a hundred and eighty men, and  it was impossible to distinguish any particular offender. So, in  virtue of this last appeal, convictism had established a tacit right to  converse in whispers, and to move about inside its oaken cage.    To one coming in from the upper air, the place would have seemed  in pitchy darkness, but the convict eye, accustomed to the sinister  twilight, was enabled to discern surrounding objects with tolerable  distinctness. The prison was about fifty feet long and fifty feet wide,  and ran the full height of the 'tween decks, viz., about five feet ten  inches high. The barricade was loop-holed here and there, and the planks  were in some places wide enough to admit a musket barrel. On the aft  side, next the soldiers' berths, was a trap door, like the stoke-hole of  a furnace. At first sight this appeared to be contrived for the  humane purpose of ventilation, but a second glance dispelled this weak  conclusion. The opening was just large enough to admit the muzzle of  a small howitzer, secured on the deck below. In case of a mutiny, the  soldiers could sweep the prison from end to end with grape shot. Such  fresh air as there was, filtered through the loopholes, and came, in  somewhat larger quantity, through a wind-sail passed into the prison  from the hatchway. But the wind-sail, being necessarily at one end only  of the place, the air it brought was pretty well absorbed by the twenty  or thirty lucky fellows near it, and the other hundred and fifty did not  come so well off. The scuttles were open, certainly, but as the row of  bunks had been built against them, the air they brought was the peculiar  property of such men as occupied the berths into which they penetrated.  These berths were twenty-eight in number, each containing six men. They  ran in a double tier round three sides of the prison, twenty at each  side, and eight affixed to that portion of the forward barricade  opposite the door. Each berth was presumed to be five feet six inches  square, but the necessities of stowage had deprived them of six inches,  and even under that pressure twelve men were compelled to sleep on  the deck. Pine did not exaggerate when he spoke of the custom of  overcrowding convict ships; and as he was entitled to half a guinea  for every man he delivered alive at Hobart Town, he had some reason to  complain.    When Frere had come down, an hour before, the prisoners were all snugly  between their blankets. They were not so now; though, at the first clink  of the bolts, they would be back again in their old positions, to all  appearances sound asleep. As the eye became accustomed to the foetid  duskiness of the prison, a strange picture presented itself. Groups  of men, in all imaginable attitudes, were lying, standing, sitting, or  pacing up and down. It was the scene on the poop-deck over again; only,  here being no fear of restraining keepers, the wild beasts were a little  more free in their movements. It is impossible to convey, in words, any  idea of the hideous phantasmagoria of shifting limbs and faces which  moved through the evil-smelling twilight of this terrible prison-house.  Callot might have drawn it, Dante might have suggested it, but a minute  attempt to describe its horrors would but disgust. There are depths in  humanity which one cannot explore, as there are mephitic caverns into  which one dare not penetrate.    Old men, young men, and boys, stalwart burglars and highway robbers,  slept side by side with wizened pickpockets or cunning-featured  area-sneaks. The forger occupied the same berth with the body-snatcher.  The man of education learned strange secrets of house-breakers' craft,  and the vulgar ruffian of St. Giles took lessons of self-control from  the keener intellect of the professional swindler. The fraudulent clerk  and the flash \"cracksman\" interchanged experiences. The smuggler's  stories of lucky ventures and successful runs were capped by the  footpad's reminiscences of foggy nights and stolen watches. The poacher,  grimly thinking of his sick wife and orphaned children, would start as  the night-house ruffian clapped him on the shoulder and bade him, with a  curse, to take good heart and \"be a man.\" The fast shopboy whose love  of fine company and high living had brought him to this pass, had  shaken off the first shame that was on him, and listened eagerly to the  narratives of successful vice that fell so glibly from the lips of his  older companions. To be transported seemed no such uncommon fate. The  old fellows laughed, and wagged their grey heads with all the glee of  past experience, and listening youth longed for the time when it might  do likewise. Society was the common foe, and magistrates, gaolers, and  parsons were the natural prey of all noteworthy mankind. Only fools "]]]
