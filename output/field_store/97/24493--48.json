None of us uttered a word until we  reached the road, lying in the white moonshine of the May night. Then  Felicity broke the tense silence by remarking to the Story Girl,    \"I told you so!\"    The Story Girl made no response. Peter sidled up to her.    \"I'm awful sorry,\" he said contritely. \"I never meant to laugh. It just  happened before I could stop myself. It was this way--\"    \"Don't you ever speak to me again,\" said the Story Girl, in a tone of  cold concentrated fury. \"Go and be a Methodist, or a Mohammedan, or  ANYTHING! I don't care what you are! You have HUMILIATED me!\"    She marched off with Sara Ray, and Peter dropped back to us with a  frightened face.    \"What is it I've done to her?\" he whispered. \"What does that big word  mean?\"    \"Oh, never mind,\" I said crossly--for I felt that Peter HAD disgraced  us--\"She's just mad--and no wonder. Whatever made you act so crazy,  Peter?\"    \"Well, I didn't mean to. And I wanted to laugh twice before that and  DIDN'T. It was the Story Girl's stories made me want to laugh, so I  don't think it's fair for her to be mad at me. She hadn't ought to tell  me stories about people if she don't want me to laugh when I see them.  When I looked at Samuel Ward I thought of him getting up in meeting  one night, and praying that he might be guided in his upsetting and  downrising. I remembered the way she took him off, and I wanted to  laugh. And then I looked at the pulpit and thought of the story she told  about the old Scotch minister who was too fat to get in at the door  of it, and had to h'ist himself by his two hands over it, and then  whispered to the other minister so that everybody heard him.    \"'_This pulpit door was made for speerits_'--and I wanted to laugh.  And then Mr. Frewen come--and I thought of her story about his  sidewhiskers--how when his first wife died of information of the lungs  he went courting Celia Ward, and Celia told him she wouldn't marry  him unless he shaved them whiskers off. And he wouldn't, just to be  stubborn. And one day one of them caught fire, when he was burning  brush, and burned off, and every one thought he'd HAVE to shave the  other off then. But he didn't and just went round with one whisker till  the burned one grew out. And then Celia gave in and took him, because  she saw there wasn't no hope of HIM ever giving in. I just remembered  that story, and I thought I could see him, taking up the cents so  solemn, with one long whisker; and the laugh just laughed itself before  I could help it.\"    We all exploded with laughter on the spot, much to the horror of Mrs.  Abraham Ward, who was just driving past, and who came up the next day  and told Aunt Janet we had \"acted scandalous\" on the road home from  church. We felt ashamed ourselves, because we knew people should conduct  themselves decently and in order on Sunday farings-forth. But, as with  Peter, it \"had laughed itself.\"    Even Felicity laughed. Felicity was not nearly so angry with Peter as  might have been expected. She even walked beside him and let him carry  her Bible. They talked quite confidentially. Perhaps she forgave him the  more easily, because he had justified her in her predictions, and thus  afforded her a decided triumph over the Story Girl.    \"I'm going to keep on going to church,\" Peter told her. \"I like it.  Sermons are more int'resting than I thought, and I like the singing.  I wish I could make up my mind whether to be a Presbyterian or a  Methodist. I s'pose I might ask the ministers about it.\"    \"Oh, no, no, don't do that,\" said Felicity in alarm. \"Ministers wouldn't  want to be bothered with such questions.\"    \"Why not? What are ministers for if they ain't to tell people how to get  to heaven?\"    \"Oh, well, it's all right for grown-ups to ask them things, of course.  But it isn't respectful for little boys--especially hired boys.\"    \"I don't see why. But anyhow, I s'pose it wouldn't be much use, because  if he was a Presbyterian minister he'd say I ought to be a Presbyterian,  and if he was a Methodist he'd tell me to be one, too. Look here,  Felicity, what IS the difference between them?\"    \"I--I don't know,\" said Felicity reluctantly. \"I s'pose children can't  understand such things. There must be a great deal of difference, of  course, if we only knew what it was. Anyhow, I am a Presbyterian, and  I'm glad of it.\"    We walked on in silence for a time, thinking our own young thoughts.  Presently they were scattered by an abrupt and startling question from  Peter.    \"What does God look like?\" he said.    It appeared that none of us had any idea.    \"The Story Girl would prob'ly know,\" said Cecily.    \"I wish I knew,\" said Peter gravely. \"I wish I could see a picture of  God. It would make Him seem lots more real.\"    \"I've often wondered myself what he looks like,\" said Felicity in a  burst of confidence. Even in Felicity, so it would seem, there were  depths of thought unplumbed.    \"I've seen pictures of Jesus,\" said Felix meditatively. \"He looks just  like a man, only better and kinder. But now that I come to think of it,  I've never seen a picture of God.\"    \"Well, if there isn't one in Toronto it isn't likely there's one  anywhere,\" said Peter disappointedly. \"I saw a picture of the devil  once,\" he added. \"It was in a book my Aunt Jane had. She got it for a  prize in school. My Aunt Jane was clever.\"    \"It couldn't have been a very good book if there was such a picture in  it,\" said Felicity.    \"It was a real good book. My Aunt Jane wouldn't have a book that wasn't  good,\" retorted Peter sulkily.    He refused to discuss the subject further, somewhat to our  disappointment. For we had never seen a picture of the person referred  to, and we were rather curious regarding it.    \"We'll ask Peter to describe it sometime when he's in a better humour,\"  whispered Felix.    Sara Ray having turned in at her own gate, I ran ahead to join the Story  Girl, and we walked up the hill together. She had recovered her calmness  of mind, but she made no reference to Peter. When we reached our lane  and passed under Grandfather King's big willow the fragrance of the  orchard struck us in the face like a wave. We could see the long rows of  trees, a white gladness in the moonshine. It seemed to us that there  was in the orchard something different from other orchards that we had  known. We were too young to analyze the vague sensation. In later years  we were to understand that it was because the orchard blossomed not only  apple blossoms but all the love, faith, joy, pure happiness and pure  sorrow of those who had made it and walked there.    \"The orchard doesn't seem the same place by moonlight at all,\" said the  Story Girl dreamily. \"It's lovely, but it's different. When I was very  small I used to believe the fairies danced in it on moonlight nights. I  would like to believe it now but I can't.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Oh, it's so hard to believe things you know are not true. It was Uncle  Edward who told me there were no such things as fairies. I was just  seven. He is a minister, so of course I knew he spoke the truth. It was  his duty to tell me, and I do not blame him, but I have never felt quite  the same to Uncle Edward since.\"    Ah, do we ever \"feel quite the same\" towards people who destroy our  illusions? Shall I ever be able to forgive the brutal creature who first  told me there was no such person as Santa Claus? He was a boy, three  years older than myself; and he may now, for aught I know, be a most  useful and respectable member of society, beloved by his kind. But I  know what he must ever seem to me!    We waited at Uncle Alec's door for the others to come up. Peter was by  way of skulking shamefacedly past into the shadows; but the Story Girl's  brief, bitter anger had vanished.    \"Wait for me, Peter,\" she called.    She went over to him and held out her hand.    \"I forgive you,\" she said graciously.    Felix and I felt that it would really be worth while to offend her,  just to be forgiven in such an adorable voice. Peter eagerly grasped her  hand.    \"I tell you what, Story Girl, I'm awfully sorry I laughed in church,  but you needn't be afraid I ever will again. No, sir! And I'm going to  church and Sunday School regular, and I'll say my prayers every night. I  want to be like the rest of you. And look here! I've thought of the way  my Aunt Jane used to give medicine to a cat. You mix the powder in lard,  and spread it on his paws and his sides and he'll lick it off, 'cause a  cat can't stand being messy. If Paddy isn't any better to-morrow, we'll  do that.\"    They went away together hand in hand, children-wise, up the lane of  spruces crossed with bars of moonlight. And there was peace over all  that fresh and flowery land, and peace in our little hearts.        CHAPTER VI. THE MYSTERY OF GOLDEN MILESTONE    Paddy was smeared with medicated lard the next day, all of us assisting  at the rite, although the Story Girl was high priestess. Then, out of  regard for mats and cushions, he was kept in durance vile in the granary  until he had licked his fur clean. This treatment being repeated every  day for a week, Pat recovered his usual health and spirits, and our  minds were set at rest to enjoy the next excitement--collecting for a  school library fund.    Our teacher thought it would be an excellent thing to have a library  in connection with the school; and he suggested that each of the pupils  should try to see how much money he or she could raise for the project  during the month of June. We might earn it by honest toil, or gather it  in by contributions levied on our friends.    The result was a determined rivalry as to which pupil should collect  the largest sum; and this rivalry was especially intense in our home  coterie.    Our relatives started us with a quarter apiece. For the rest, we knew we  must depend on our own exertions.

Once upon a time there lived an old man and an old woman. And when they  were quite old, the old woman said to her husband \"How shall these our  children get food when we are gone?\" So the old man travelled afar to  the great god Kuvera, [26] the god of riches, and, taking from him  seedlings of paddy, pulse, mustard, and gourds, journeyed for eight  days and so reached his home. And after staying a couple of days,  he set forth to cultivate, taking dry food with him. And first he  marked out a piece of rich land by placing boundaries on all four  sides of it, and so came home. And again he set out another day with  hoe and axe, and cut and burned the jungle, and cleaned the soil,  and after worshipping on each side of his field--on the east and on  the west, on the north and on the south--he struck one blow with his  hoe on each side.    And when all was ready, the old man planted his seedlings of various  sorts, and finally went home and rested. And so, as time went by,  the old woman desired vehemently to see how the crops were getting  on. But the old man said \"There is no water on the road, and if you  grow athirst, you will get no relief.\" But she persisted and prevailed,  and made her husband take her along. And as they went, and were now  quite close to her husband's field, behold, the old woman began to  be very thirsty. And the old man, being enraged, cried \"What did I  tell you? There is no water, and yet you would come.\" But she, being  a woman, said \"If you do not give me to drink, I shall die. So, water  you must"]]]
