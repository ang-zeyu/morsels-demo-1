He could not have lived there at all but  for the protection of the Indians. His father-in-law had been friendly  with the Navajos and Piutes for many years, and his wife had been  brought up among them. She was held in peculiar reverence and affection  by both tribes in that part of the country. Probably she knew more of  the Indians' habits, religion, and life than any white person in the  West. Both tribes were friendly and peaceable, but there were bad  Indians, half-breeds, and outlaws that made the trading-post a venture  Withers had long considered precarious, and he wanted to move and  intended to some day. His nearest neighbors in New Mexico and Colorado  were a hundred miles distant and at some seasons the roads were  impassable. To the north, however, twenty miles or so, was situated a  Mormon village named Stonebridge. It lay across the Utah line. Withers  did some business with this village, but scarcely enough to warrant  the risks he had to run. During the last year he had lost several  pack-trains, one of which he had never heard of after it left  Stonebridge.    \"Stonebridge!\" exclaimed Shefford, and he trembled. He had heard that  name. In his memory it had a place beside the name of another village  Shefford longed to speak of to this trader.    \"Yes--Stonebridge,\" replied Withers. \"Ever heard the name?\"    \"I think so. Are there other villages in--in that part of the country?\"    \"A few, but not close. Glaze is now only a water-hole. Bluff and  Monticello are far north across the San Juan.... There used to be  another village--but that wouldn't interest you.\"    \"Maybe it would,\" replied Shefford, quietly.    But his hint was not taken by the trader. Withers suddenly showed a  semblance of the aloofness Shefford had observed in Whisner.    \"Withers, pardon an impertinence--I am deeply serious.... Are you a  Mormon?\"    \"Indeed I'm not,\" replied the trader, instantly.    \"Are you for the Mormons or against them?\"    \"Neither. I get along with them. I know them. I believe they are a  misunderstood people.\"    \"That's for them.\"    \"No. I'm only fair-minded.\"    Shefford paused, trying to curb his thrilling impulse, but it was too  strong.    \"You said there used to be another village.... Was the name of  it--Cottonwoods?\"    Withers gave a start and faced round to stare at Shefford in blank  astonishment.    \"Say, did you give me a straight story about yourself?\" he queried,  sharply.    \"So far as I went,\" replied Shefford.    \"You're no spy on the lookout for sealed wives?\"    \"Absolutely not. I don't even know what you mean by sealed wives.\"    \"Well, it's damn strange that you'd know the name Cottonwoods.... Yes,  that's the name of the village I meant--the one that used to be. It's  gone now, all except a few stone walls.\"    \"What became of it?\"    \"Torn down by Mormons years ago. They destroyed it and moved away. I've  heard Indians talk about a grand spring that was there once. It's gone,  too. Its name was--let me see--\"    \"Amber Spring,\" interrupted Shefford.    \"By George, you're right!\" rejoined the trader, again amazed. \"Shefford,  this beats me. I haven't heard that name for ten years. I can't help  seeing what a tenderfoot--stranger--you are to the desert. Yet, here you  are--speaking of what you should know nothing of.... And there's more  behind this.\"    Shefford rose, unable to conceal his agitation.    \"Did you ever hear of a rider named Venters?\"    \"Rider? You mean a cowboy? Venters. No, I never heard that name.\"    \"Did you ever hear of a gunman named Lassiter?\" queried Shefford, with  increasing emotion.    \"No.\"    \"Did you ever hear of a Mormon woman named--Jane Withersteen?\"    \"No.\"    Shefford drew his breath sharply. He had followed a gleam--he had caught  a fleeting glimpse of it.    \"Did you ever hear of a child--a girl--a woman--called Fay Larkin?\"    Withers rose slowly with a paling face.    \"If you're a spy it'll go hard with you--though I'm no Mormon,\" he said,  grimly.    Shefford lifted a shaking hand.    \"I WAS a clergyman. Now I'm nothing--a wanderer--least of all a spy.\"    Withers leaned closer to see into the other man's eyes; he looked long  and then appeared satisfied.    \"I've heard the name Fay Larkin,\" he said, slowly. \"I reckon that's all  I'll say till you tell your story.\"    . . . . . . . . . . .    Shefford stood with his back to the fire and he turned the palms of  his hands to catch the warmth. He felt cold. Withers had affected him  strangely. What was the meaning of the trader's somber gravity? Why was  the very mention of Mormons attended by something austere and secret?    \"My name is John Shefford. I am twenty-four,\" began Shefford. \"My  family--\"    Here a knock on the door interrupted Shefford.    \"Come in,\" called Withers.    The door opened and like a shadow Nas Ta Bega slipped in. He said  something in Navajo to the trader.    \"How,\" he said to Shefford, and extended his hand. He was stately, but  there was no mistaking his friendliness. Then he sat down before the  fire, doubled his legs under him after the Indian fashion, and with dark  eyes on the blazing logs seemed to lose himself in meditation.      \"He likes the fire,\" explained Withers. \"Whenever he comes to Kayenta he  always visits me like this.... Don't mind him. Go on with your story.\"    \"My family were plain people, well-to-do, and very religious,\" went on  Shefford. \"When I was a boy we moved from the country to a town called  Beaumont, Illinois. There was a college in Beaumont and eventually I was  sent to it to study for the ministry. I wanted to be---- But never mind  that.... By the time I was twenty-two I was ready for my career as a  clergyman. I preached for a year around at different places and then got  a church in my home town of Beaumont. I became exceedingly good friends  with a man named Venters, who had recently come to Beaumont. He was a  singular man. His wife was a strange, beautiful woman, very reserved,  and she had wonderful dark eyes. They had money and were devoted to each  other, and perfectly happy. They owned the finest horses ever seen in  Illinois, and their particular enjoyment seemed to be riding. They were  always taking long rides. It was something worth going far for to see  Mrs. Venters on a horse.    \"It was through my own love of horses that I became friendly with  Venters. He and his wife attended my church, and as I got to see more  of them, gradually we grew intimate. And it was not until I did get  intimate with them that I realized that both seemed to be haunted by the  past. They were sometimes sad even in their happiness. They drifted  off into dreams. They lived back in another world. They seemed to be  listening. Indeed, they were a singularly interesting couple, and I grew  genuinely fond of them. By and by they had a little girl whom they named  Jane. The coming of the baby made a change in my friends. They were  happier, and I observed that the haunting shadow did not so often  return.    \"Venters had spoken of a journey west that he and his wife meant to  take some time. But after the baby came he never mentioned his wife in  connection with the trip. I gathered that he felt compelled to go to  clear up a mystery or to find something--I did not make out just what.  But eventually, and it was about a year ago, he told me his story--the  strangest, wildest, and most tragic I ever heard. I can't tell it all  now. It is enough to say that fifteen years before he had been a  rider for a rich Mormon woman named Jane Withersteen, of this village  Cottonwoods. She had adopted a beautiful Gentile child named Fay Larkin.  Her interest in Gentiles earned the displeasure of her churchmen, and as  she was proud there came a breach. Venters and a gunman named Lassiter  became involved in her quarrel. Finally Venters took to the canyon. Here  in the wilds he found the strange girl he eventually married. For a long  time they lived in a wonderful hidden valley, the entrance to which was  guarded by a huge balancing rock. Venters got away with the girl. But  Lassiter and Jane Withersteen and the child Fay Larkin were driven into  the canyon. They escaped to the valley where Venters had lived. Lassiter  rolled the balancing rock, and, crashing down the narrow trail, it  loosened the weathered walls and closed the narrow outlet for ever.\"          IV. NEW FRIENDS      Shefford ended his narrative out of breath, pale, and dripping with  sweat. Withers sat leaning forward with an expression of intense  interest. Nas Ta Bega's easy, graceful pose had succeeded to one  of strained rigidity. He seemed a statue of bronze. Could a few  intelligible words, Shefford wondered, have created that strange,  listening posture?    \"Venters got out of Utah, of course, as you know,\" went on Shefford. \"He  got out, knowing--as I feel I would have known--that Jane, Lassiter, and  little Fay Larkin were shut up, walled up in Surprise Valley. For years  Venters considered it would not have been safe for him to venture  to rescue them. He had no fears for their lives. They could live in  Surprise Valley. But Venters always intended to come back with Bess and  find the valley and his friends. No wonder he and Bess were haunted.  However, when his wife had the baby that made a difference. It meant he  had to go alone. And he was thinking seriously of starting when--when  there were developments that made it desirable for me to leave Beaumont.  Venters's story haunted me as he had been haunted. I dreamed of that  wild valley--of little Fay Larkin grown to womanhood--such a woman  as Bess Venters was. And the longing to come was great.... And,  Withers--here I am.\"    The trader reached out and gave Shefford the grip of a man in whom  emotion was powerful, but deep and difficult to express.    \"Listen to this.... I wish I could help you. Life is a queer deal. ...  Shefford, I've "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5089"],[0,"Boris Godunov: a drama in verse (#8)"],[1,"? Who demanded     Confession of thee? If thou, a nameless vagrant     Couldst wonderfully blind two nations, then     At least thou shouldst have merited success,     And thy bold fraud secured, by constant, deep,     And lasting secrecy. Say, can I yield     Myself to thee, can I, forgetting rank     And maiden modesty, unite my fate     With thine, when thou thyself impetuously     Dost thus with such simplicity reveal     Thy shame? It was from Love he blabbed to me!     I marvel wherefore thou hast not from friendship     Disclosed thyself ere now before my father,     Or else before our king from joy, or else     Before Prince Vishnevetsky from the zeal     Of a devoted servant.       PRETENDER.          I swear to thee     That thou alone wast able to extort     My heart's confession; I swear to thee that never,     Nowhere, not in the feast, not in the cup     Of folly, not in friendly confidence,     Not 'neath the knife nor tortures of the rack,     Shall my tongue give away these weighty secrets.       MARINA. Thou swearest! Then I must believe. Believe,     Of course! But may I learn by what thou swearest?     Is it not by the name of God, as suits     The Jesuits' devout adopted son?     Or by thy honour as a high-born knight?     Or, maybe, by thy royal word alone     As a king's son? Is it not so? Declare.       PRETENDER. (Proudly.) The phantom of the Terrible hath made me     His son; from out the sepulchre hath named me     Dimitry, hath stirred up the people round me,     And hath consigned Boris to be my victim.     I am tsarevich. Enough! 'Twere shame for me     To stoop before a haughty Polish dame.     Farewell for ever; the game of bloody war,     The wide cares of my destiny, will smother,     I hope, the pangs Of love. O, when the heat     Of shameful passion is o'erspent, how then     Shall I detest thee! Now I leave thee--ruin,     Or else a crown, awaits my head in Russia;     Whether I meet with death as fits a soldier     In honourable fight, or as a miscreant     Upon the public scaffold, thou shalt not     Be my companion, nor shalt share with me     My fate; but it may be thou shalt regret     The destiny thou hast refused.       MARINA.                      But what     If I expose beforehand thy bold fraud     To all men?       PRETENDER. Dost thou think I fear thee? Think'st thou     They will believe a Polish maiden more     Than Russia's own tsarevich? Know, proud lady,     That neither king, nor pope, nor nobles trouble     Whether my words be true, whether I be     Dimitry or another. What care they?     But I provide a pretext for revolt     And war; and this is all they need; and thee,     Rebellious one, believe me, they will force     To hold thy peace. Farewell.       MARINA.                    Tsarevich, stay!     At last I hear the speech not of a boy,     But of a man. It reconciles me to thee.     Prince, I forget thy senseless outburst, see     Again Dimitry. Listen; now is the time!     Hasten; delay no more, lead on thy troops     Quickly to Moscow, purge the Kremlin, take     Thy seat upon the throne of Moscow; then     Send me the nuptial envoy; but, God hears me,     Until thy foot be planted on its steps,     Until by thee Boris be overthrown,     I am not one to listen to love-speeches.       PRETENDER. No--easier far to strive with Godunov.     Or play false with the Jesuits of the Court,     Than with a woman. Deuce take them; they're beyond     My power. She twists, and coils, and crawls, slips out     Of hand, she hisses, threatens, bites. Ah, serpent!     Serpent! 'Twas not for nothing that I trembled.     She well-nigh ruined me; but I'm resolved;     At daybreak I will put my troops in motion.          THE LITHUANIAN FRONTIER    (OCTOBER 16TH, 1604)    PRINCE KURBSKY and PRETENDER, both on horseback.  Troops approach the Frontier       KURBSKY. (Galloping at their head.)     There, there it is; there is the Russian frontier!     Fatherland! Holy Russia! I am thine!     With scorn from off my clothing now I shake     The foreign dust, and greedily I drink     New air; it is my native air. O father,     Thy soul hath now been solaced; in the grave     Thy bones, disgraced, thrill with a sudden joy!     Again doth flash our old ancestral sword,     This glorious sword--the dread of dark Kazan!     This good sword--servant of the tsars of Moscow!     Now will it revel in its feast of slaughter,     Serving the master of its hopes.       PRETENDER. (Moves quietly with bowed head.) How happy     Is he, how flushed with gladness and with glory     His stainless soul! Brave knight, I envy thee!     The son of Kurbsky, nurtured in exile,     Forgetting all the wrongs borne by thy father,     Redeeming his transgression in the grave,     Ready art thou for the son of great Ivan     To shed thy blood, to give the fatherland     Its lawful tsar. Righteous art thou; thy soul     Should flame with joy.       KURBSKY.             And dost not thou likewise     Rejoice in spirit? There lies our Russia; she     Is thine, tsarevich! There thy people's hearts     Are waiting for thee, there thy Moscow waits,     Thy Kremlin, thy dominion.       PRETENDER.               Russian blood,     O Kurbsky, first must flow! Thou for the tsar     Hast drawn the sword, thou art stainless; but I lead you     Against your brothers; I am summoning     Lithuania against Russia; I am showing     To foes the longed-for way to beauteous Moscow!     But let my sin fall not on me, but thee,     Boris, the regicide! Forward! Set on!       KURBSKY. Forward! Advance! And woe to Godunov.       (They gallop. The troops cross the frontier.)          THE COUNCIL OF THE TSAR    The TSAR, the PATRIARCH and Boyars       TSAR. Is it possible? An unfrocked monk against us     Leads rascal troops, a truant friar dares write     Threats to us! Then 'tis time to tame the madman!     Trubetskoy, set thou forth, and thou Basmanov;     My zealous governors need help. Chernigov     Already by the rebel is besieged;     Rescue the city and citizens.       BASMANOV.                   Three months     Shall not pass, Sire, ere even rumour's tongue     Shall cease to speak of the pretender; caged     In iron, like a wild beast from oversea,     We'll hale him into Moscow, I swear by God.       (Exit with TRUBETSKOY.)       TSAR. The Lord of Sweden hath by envoys tendered     Alliance to me. But we have no need     To lean on foreign aid; we have enough     Of our own warlike people to repel     Traitors and Poles. I have refused.--Shchelkalov!     In every district to the governors     Send edicts, that they mount their steeds, and send     The people as of old on service; likewise     Ride to the monasteries, and there enlist     The servants of the churchmen. In days of old,     When danger faced our country, hermits freely     Went into battle; it is not now our wish     To trouble them; no, let them pray for us;     Such is the tsar's decree, such the resolve     Of his boyars. And now a weighty question     We shall determine; ye know how everywhere     The insolent pretender hath spread abroad     His artful rumours; letters everywhere,     By him distributed, have sowed alarm     And doubt; seditious whispers to and fro     Pass in the market-places; minds are seething.     We needs must cool them; gladly would I refrain     From executions, but by what means and how?     That we will now determine. Holy father,     Thou first declare thy thought.       PATRIARCH.                    The Blessed One,     The All-Highest, hath instilled into thy soul,     Great lord, the spirit of kindness and meek patience;     Thou wishest not perdition for the sinner,     Thou wilt wait quietly, until delusion     Shall pass away; for pass away it will,     And truth's eternal sun will dawn on all.     Thy faithful bedesman, one in worldly matters     No prudent judge, ventures today to offer     His voice to thee. This offspring of the devil,     This unfrocked monk, has known how to appear     Dimitry to the people. Shamelessly     He clothed himself with the name of the tsarevich     As with a stolen vestment. It only needs     To tear it off--and he'll be put to shame     By his own nakedness. The means thereto     God hath Himself supplied. Know, sire, six years     Since then have fled; 'twas in that very year     When to the seat of sovereignty the Lord     Anointed thee--there came to me one evening     A simple shepherd, a venerable old man,     Who told me a strange secret. \"In my young days,\"     He said, \"I lost my sight, and thenceforth knew not     Nor day, nor night, till my old age; in vain     I plied myself with herbs and secret spells;     In vain did I resort in adoration     To the great wonder-workers in the cloister;     Bathed my dark eyes in vain with healing water     From out the holy wells. The Lord vouchsafed not     Healing to me. Then lost I hope at last,     And grew accustomed to my darkness. Even     Slumber showed not to me things visible,     Only of sounds I dreamed. Once in deep sleep     I hear a childish voice; it speaks to me:     `Arise, grandfather, go to Uglich town,     To the Cathedral of Transfiguration;     There pray over my grave. The Lord is gracious--     And I shall pardon thee.'  `But who art thou?'     I asked the childish voice. `I am the tsarevich     Dimitry, whom the Heavenly Tsar hath taken     Into His angel band, and I am now     A mighty wonder-worker. Go, old man.'     I woke, and pondered. What is this? Maybe     God will in very deed vouchsafe to me     Belated healing. I will go. I bent     My footsteps to the distant road. I reached     Uglich, repair unto the holy minster,     Hear mass, and, glowing with zealous soul, I weep     Sweetly, as if the blindness from mine eyes     Were flowing out in tears. And when the people     Began to leave, to my grandson I said:     `Lead me, Ivan, to the grave of the tsarevich     Dimitry.' The boy led me--and"]]]
