No, it will take him as many days  to recover and often he will be of no use for the remainder of the  hunt.    Dogs like these may suit men living in the country where there is  game. Their dogs after having been lost several times will, through  time, know the lay of the country and be fairly good dogs at home,  but take these hounds in a strange country, of what use and how many  will a hunting party require to hunt every day of their outing? Well,  they will require a car-load and besides several men to hunt the  dogs. Such dogs as these don't stay with me, as I consider them a  nuisance, especially for city sportsmen, who are so busy during the  whole year that they can only take a few weeks holiday every year,  they require a strain of hounds on which they can depend every day of  their hunt. I want a dog to be a flyer and to back track after every  chase and to find me in the bush and not make for camp after his  chase or wait at the shore until some \"Johnny Sneakum\" comes along  with his canoe and says, \"Get in Jack,\" and that Jack is only too  glad to jump in and the next thing is that you don't see Jack for the  balance of the season, but you will learn later on that Jack has been  half starved that it will cost you $5.00 to $10.00 for the board if  you desire to get Jack.    I will say here that I owe my life to two of my hounds. I was lost  once in the woods in a blinding snow storm. This was in Western  Ontario amongst a range of sappy pine hills. I was about five miles  from camp. In the morning when I left the weather was very fine but  it soon started to snow and the storm lasted until about 9 P. M. I  was soaking wet and I had left my compass at camp, my matches were  all wet and I slept in the bush. At 10 A. M. I had started my two  hounds and about 11 A. M. they came back to me. It was just  commencing to snow heavily but thinking it would not last long, I  made for another hill where I was aware, if any deer started from  there it was a sure run for our men, so I arrived there in due time  and got a start. It was still snowing very heavily. I then pointed  for home. I had about five miles more to reach our camp when I came  to a place where a deer had just left his nest, so I thought that I  could get a shot at him but after having followed him for about an  hour, I gave him up and I tried to make for camp.    Well, instead of making for camp, I made a circle and came back to  the same place where I had left the deer's track. It was 4 P. M.,  when my dogs came back to me. I knew then that I was completely  turned so I decided to spend the night right there. I looked for a  sheltered place and after removing all the snow I could I lay down  with my back against a big flat stone and with my two dogs lying near  me. We were quite comfortable and early in the morning, I pointed for  camp. Now if these dogs had not returned to me, I really believe that  I would not be able to write this, as their heat preserved me from  freezing to death.        CHAPTER IX.    TRAINING--SPECIFIC THINGS TO TEACH.    To teach the dog to bark treed, it is best, of course, to take him  out with an old dog, but if you have no old dog, you can train him  without one. This can be done by catching a live ground hog, 'coon or  opossum. Take the animal you have to some small tree, a dogwood for  instance, and let it climb from the ground up. It would be better if  you could lead it or even drag it a short distance--ten feet, say, at  first, to a tree.    Don't let your dog look on while doing this. After you have your  animal treed, get your dog and bring him to the tree and give him the  scent on the ground. If he is new at the business, he will not likely  look up the tree, but will hunt for trail. If he finds where the  animal is himself, try to get him to bark, but if he doesn't find it,  then show him. Try to make him bark. That is one of the objects at  this point as well as to find where the animal is.    Have your gun along, and as soon as you get your dog to bark, shoot  into the air and at the same time, pull the animal out of the tree by  the string by which he is tied. But whatever you do, don't let the  animal get the best of your young dog or you will have a spoiled dog.  I always liked a possum for this work because they are easy to handle  and don't fight your dog.      [Illustration: Good Friends Get Along Best.]    You must remember that, at this point, you are not training your dog  to fight. The object is first to find where the animal goes and  second to get your dog to \"bark up.\" Continue this practice for some  time; then put your animal in a larger tree out of sight but don't  put in the same tree each time, After you have your dog trained so he  will trail and bark up in the manner just described, the chances are  that he will tree 'coon, if he gets a fresh trail. Of course, he will  not be a good 'coon dog at once; that comes by experience.    Next to a good dog in the 'coon hunting business, is a good gun and  lantern. Don't try to hunt 'coon with a common open lantern. A good  kind of lantern to find their eyes with is a dark or police lantern,  as you don't have to put them on your head to find their eyes. But  whatever kind you use, have one with a good bulls-eye and a  reflector. Use a good shot gun. I generally use No. 2 shot.    Having prepared ourselves with a good dog, gun and lantern, we are  now ready for business. We will go out first on a cloudy night. We  will go into the woods and walk slowly, giving the dog plenty of time  to hunt and if we don't see him pretty soon, we will sit down on a  log and wait a while.    Don't go thru the woods as if some one were after you or as if you  were in a hurry and then call your dog as soon as you get thru the  woods. You will never have a good 'coon dog if you do so, especially  if he is new at the business. If you want a dog that will stay by the  trail, you want to stay with him. If you use your dog properly that  is, if you hunt slow and sit down on a log or wait for your dog until  he comes in and then move on as soon as he does come in, you will  find that your dog will soon \"catch on\" to this and will always come  in as soon as he has a woods or a portion of a woods hunted over,  unless he \"trees.\"    Another brother offers the following suggestions: \"Let me give you a  few pointers in regard to breaking them to hunt 'coon. When the pup  is five or six months old, teach him to speak or bark by holding up a  piece of meat or bread, and when you get him so he will bark, take  him into the woods where there are squirrels. Be sure and take your  gun along and chase every squirrel or cat up a tree and shoot the  squirrel. Be sure and make the dog help to chase the squirrel then  skin the squirrel. Cut it up in small pieces and feed it to your dog.  Do this as often as possible and you will be surprised how quickly he  will learn. Commence early in the fall to hunt 'coon, and keep away  as much as possible from the haunts of the rabbit with your dog, but  if he gets after a rabbit, get him off as soon as possible and scold  him. I wouldn't advise anyone to hunt rabbits with dog until  thoroughly broken to hunt 'coon.\"    TEACHING THE DOG HOW TO SWIM.    As for swimming, we are aware that all dogs when thrown in the water  can swim, but the question is, will they swim right and take to water  at once. I say no, they all need training before they will take to  water when told, swim and float right and remain in the water for  hours when necessary, and also return game from water when required  whether it be for fur or feathers.    To teach a dog to swim, take him often to a nice shore and let him  play at the edge of the water and say nothing to him. After you have  done this during three or four days, tie him and row about thirty  yards from shore. Use a flat bottom boat or a good safe one and place  him gently in the water, hold his head above the water till he  floats, then row to the shore. He will follow and as soon as you  land, get out of the boat and call him to the shore. This will teach  him to land because should you stay in the boat, he will try to get  in the boat with you.    Now allow him to play for five or ten minutes, then repeat the same  tactics but row a little further.  After two or three days lessons  such as these, the dog will take the water. To make him do this, row  a few yards from the shore and call him. He will at once follow you.  Row slowly away and the moment you see he is getting tired, pull him  on board or row to shore. Never train your dog to swim during cold  weather but when it is warm and sunny. A nice sunny morning is the  best time to teach them to swim. Once he knows how to swim right,  take him across a small river or lake and then come back and make him  swim back. He will then never be afraid of water.    To teach a hound to properly ride in a canoe, tie him and have a whip  or a small switch and make him lie down. Always speak to him kindly.  Mention the dog's name and say lie down. If he does not obey, whip  but do so carefully. \"Avoid whipping,\" because there has been many  dogs that would have been good hunters that have been completely  spoiled by the whip. Always speak to your dog, then give one single  stroke; if he does not obey give another stroke and so on until he  does so. As soon as he lies down, you can allow him to put up his  head and look above the boat and row across the river or lake. Once  on the other side, order him off and hold your rope which must be a  long one. If he goes to jump, give him a good check and make him walk  off easily. Once he is landed, hold him and pet him. Stay there five  minutes or so, then get in the boat again, hold the boat and order  your dog to get in the boat. I use the word \"Board.\" Mention the  dog's name and say \"board\" and to order him out, say \"move.\"    As soon as the dog gets in the boat say, \"L"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#8)"],[1,"from a lion?

According, however, to the chronological list of Suras  given by Weil (Leben M. p. 364) from ancient tradition, as well as from the  consentient voice of tradionists and commentaries (v. Nöld. Geschichte, p.  69; Sprengers Life of Mohammad, p. 111) it was the next revealed after the  Fatrah, and the designation to the prophetic office.  The main features of  the tradition are, that Muhammad while wandering about in the hills near  Mecca, distracted by doubts and by anxiety after truth, had a vision of the  Angel Gabriel seated on a throne between heaven and earth, that he ran to his  wife, Chadijah, in the greatest alarm, and desired her, perhaps from  superstitious motives (and believing that if covered with clothes he should  be shielded from the glances of evil spiritscomp. Stanley on I Cor. xi. 10),  to envelope him in his mantle; that then Gabriel came down and addressed him  as in v. I.  This vision, like that which preceded Sura xcvi., may actually  have occurred during the hallucinations of one of the epileptic fits from  which Muhammad from early youth appears to have suffered.  Hence Muhammad in  Sura lxxxi. appeals to it as a matter of fact, and such he doubtless believe  it to be.  It may here be observed, that however absurd the Muslim traditions  may be in many of their details, it will generally be found that where there  is an ancient and tolerably universal consent, there will be found at the  bottom a residuum of fact and historical truth.  At the same time there can  be no doubt but that the details of the traditions are too commonly founded  upon the attempt to explain or to throw light upon a dark passage of the  Koran, and are pure inventions of a later age.    2 The Arabic words are not those used in later Suras to express the same  idea.    3  Said to be Walid b. Mogheira, a person of note among the unbelieving  Meccans.  This portion of the Sura seems to be of a different date from the  first seven verses, though very ancient, and the change of subject is similar  to that at v. 9 of the previous Sura.    4 This and the three following verses wear the appearance of having been  inserted at a later period to meet objections respecting the number of the  angels who guard hell, raised by the Jews; perhaps at Medina, as the four  classes of persons specified are those whom Muhammad had to deal with in that  city, viz., the Jews, Believers, the Hypocrites, or undecided, and Idolaters.  These are constantly mentioned together in the Medina Suras.    5 That is, who believe, and do not believe.    6 As the word sakar disturbs the rhyme, it may have been inserted by a  mistake of the copyist for the usual word, which suits it.    7 That is, death.  Beidh.  Comp. Sura xv. 99.      SURA LXXIII. THE ENFOLDED1 [III.]    MECCA. 20 Verses.    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    O THOU ENFOLDED in thy mantle,    Stand up all night, except a small portion of it, for prayer:    Half; or curtail the half a little,    Or add to it: And with measured tone intone the Koran,2    For we shall devolve on thee weighty words.    Verily, at the oncoming of night are devout impressions strongest, and words  are most collected;3    But in the day time thou hast continual employ    And commemorate the name of thy Lord, and devote thyself to Him with entire  devotion.    Lord of the East and of the West! No God is there but He! Take Him for thy  protector,    And endure what they say with patience, and depart from them with a decorous  departure.    And let Me alone with the gainsayers, rich in the pleasures of this life; and  bear thou with them yet a little while:    For with Us are strong fetters, and a flaming fire,    And food that choketh, and a sore torment.    The day cometh when the earth and the mountains shall be shaken; and the  mountains shall become a loose sand heap.    Verily, we have sent you an Apostle to witness against you, even as we sent  an Apostle to Pharaoh:    But Pharaoh rebelled against the Apostle, and we therefore laid hold on him  with a severe chastisement.    And how, if ye believe not, will you screen yourselves from the day that  shall turn children greyheaded?    The very heaven shall be reft asunder by it: this threat shall be carried  into effect.    Lo! this is a warning. Let him then who will, take the way to his Lord.    Of a truth,4 thy Lord knoweth that thou prayest almost two-thirds, or half,  or a third of the night, as do a part of thy followers. But God measureth the  night and the day:  He knoweth that ye cannot count its hours aright, and  therefore, turneth to you mercifully. Recite then so much of the Koran as may  be easy to you. He knoweth that there will be some among you sick, while  others travel through the earth in quest of the bounties of God; and others  do battle in his cause. Recite therefore so much of it as may be easy. And  observe the Prayers and pay the legal Alms,5 and lend God a liberal loan: for  whatever good works ye send on before for your own behoof, ye shall find with  God. This will be best and richest in the recompense. And seek the  forgiveness of God: verily, God is forgiving, Merciful.      _______________________    1 From the first line of this Sura, and its expressions concerning the Koran,  Prayer, and Future Punishment: from the similarity of the tradition with  regard to its having been preceded by a vision of Gabriel (Beidh., etc.), it  seems to belong to, or at least to describe, a period, perhaps immediately  succeeding the Fatrah, during which the hours of night were spent by Muhammad  in devotion and in the labour of working up his materials in rhythmical and  rhyming Suras, and in preparation for the public assumption of the prophetic  office. Comp. especially verses 11, 19, 20, at the end, with 11, 54, 55, of  the preceding Sura.    2 Singe den Koran laut. H.v.P. Psalle Alcoranum psallendo. Mar. Singe den  Koran mit singender und lauter Stimme ab. Ullm.    3 Lit. most firm, perhaps, distinct.    4 This verse, according to a tradition of Ayesha, was revealed one year later  than the previous part of the Sura. Nöldeke says it is \"offenbar ein  Medinischer.\"    5 The reader will not be surprised to find in the very outset of Muhammad's  career a frequent mention of Alms, Prayer, Heaven, Hell, Judgment, Apostles,  etc., in their usual sense, when he remembers that Judaism was extensively  naturalised in Arabia, and Christianity, also, although to a smaller extent.  The words and phrases of these religions were doubtless familiar to the  Meccans, especially to that numerous body who were anxiously searching after  some better religion than the idolatries of their fathers (v. on Sura iii.  19, 60), and provided Muhammad with a copious fund from which to draw.      SURA XCIII.1THE BRIGHTNESS [IV.]    MECCA.11 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    BY the noon-day BRIGHTNESS,    And by the night when it darkeneth!    Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee, neither hath he been displeased.    And surely the Future shall be better for thee than the Past,    And in the end shall thy Lord be bounteous to thee and thou be satisfied.    Did he not find thee an orphan2 and gave thee a home?    And found thee erring and guided thee,3    And found thee needy and enriched thee.    As to the orphan therefore wrong him not;    And as to him that asketh of thee, chide him not away;    And as for the favours of thy Lord tell them abroad.      _______________________    1 This and the six following Suras are expressions of a state of deep mental  anxiety and depression, in which Muhammad seeks to reassure himself by  calling to mind the past favours of God, and by fixing his mind steadfastly  on the Divine Unity. They belong to a period either before the public  commencement of his ministry or when his success was very dubious, and his  future career by no means clearly marked out.    2 The charge of the orphaned Muhammad was undertaken by Abd-al-Mutalib, his  grandfather, A.D. 576. Hishami, p. 35; Kitab al Wakidi, p. 22, have preserved  traditions of the fondness with which the old man of fourscore years treated  the child, spreading a rug for him under the shadow of the Kaaba, protecting  him from the rudeness of his own sons, etc.    3 Up to his 40th year Muhammad followed the religion of his countrymen. Waq.  Tabari says that when he first entered on his office of Prophet, even his  wife Chadijah had read the Scriptures, and was acquainted with the History of  the Prophets. Spreng. p. 100. But his conformity can only have been partial.

And taken off from thee thy burden,    Which galled thy back?    And have we not raised thy name for thee?    Then verily along with trouble cometh ease.    Verily along with trouble cometh ease.    But when thou art set at liberty, then prosecute thy toil.    And seek thy Lord with fervour.
