All females taken in December, and most of those taken in January,  also were sexually quiescent. January 20 was the earliest recorded date  for a female with a vaginal orifice. Females examined in February mostly  were perforate and many of them appeared to be in oestrus. One female  trapped on February 19, 1950, weighed only 140 grams and was still  imperforate. Another, weighing 200 grams on February 3, 1952, still was  imperforate, but by February 27 she was perforate and appeared to be in  oestrus. An adult female that appeared to be in oestrus on February 3,  1952, was imperforate on February 10.      _Growth_    At birth woodrats weigh approximately 10 grams or a little more. In a  litter born in captivity and kept by Rainey, the average gain amounted  to a little more than 1.5 grams per day during the first two months, but  in the third month it was somewhat less. As this was an unusually large  litter, of five young, one more than the female's teats could  accommodate, their growth may have been a little less rapid than in most  of those under natural conditions. At an age of three months they  averaged approximately 120 grams. The three males consistently exceeded  the two females.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Typical growth curves for male and female  woodrats; early stages are based on the litter of a captive female,  later stages on average gains of recaptured juveniles and subadults,  excluding those that seemed to be stunted. Solid line represents males  and broken line represents females.]    Young weighing less than 100 grams are rarely caught in live-traps. Four  young, all males, first caught at an average weight of 80 grams, gained  on the average, 1.39 grams per day over intervals that averaged 44 days.  Six other young males first caught while in the weight range of 100 to  149 grams, were recaptured after intervals of 17 to 45 days and they had  gained, on the average, .92 grams per day. The corresponding figure for  four young females in the same size range was .71 grams per day. In  seven young males in the weight range 150 to 250 grams, that were caught  after intervals averaging 66 days, the gain in weight amounted to .83  grams per day. In seven females in the range 150 to 199 grams, gains  averaged only .68 grams per day. Fully grown females that are not  pregnant weigh, most typically, a little less than 250 grams while fully  grown adult males average a little more than 300 grams. Growth rate and  adult weight both are influenced to a large extent by season and even  more by individual differences. The underlying causes are obscure in  most instances, but individual rats that are still short of adult size  may stop growing for periods of months, and some individuals grow much  more rapidly than others. One male that weighed 108 grams when he was  first caught on July 3, 1951, was estimated to have been born in early  May. He was last captured 152 days later on December 2, 1951, and by  then his weight was 300 grams, representing an increase of 1.2 grams per  day. Another male that weighed only 75 grams when he was caught on  October 8, 1950, may have been less than two months old then. By  November 21, 1951, at a probable age of 15 months, he weighed 350 grams  having attained almost the maximum size. Other exceptionally large  individuals were known to be less than two years old, while those rats  that survived longest on the study areas did not much exceed average  adult size. These records seem to show that exceptionally large woodrats  are usually not those of advanced age, but are individuals which have  grown most rapidly through fortuitous circumstances, probably depending  upon both innate and environmental factors.    None of the woodrats handled was excessively fat, nor were any  emaciated. The habit of keeping on hand stores of food at all seasons  perhaps obviates the necessity for storing quantities of fat. Seasonal  trends in weight vary among individuals, and are not wholly consistent  from year to year. Rainey found that in late autumn and winter, rats  steadily gain weight reaching a peak in late February or March. However,  in the winters of 1948-49 and 1949-50, Fitch found that most rats lost  weight and hardly any, even those that were short of adult size, made  gains.    The following records of a male born in the spring of 1949 show rapid  growth and attainment of adult size in his first summer, cessation of  growth during the winter, and resumption of growth, with attainment of  near-maximum size the following spring.        June 16, 1949           96 gms.      September 26, 1949     230 gms.      September 27, 1949     230 gms.      October 18, 1949       260 gms.      October 27, 1949       250 gms.      October 29, 1949       220 gms.      November 8, 1949       235 gms.      November 15, 1949      245 gms.      November 24, 1949      240 gms.      November 26, 1949      240 gms.      November 30, 1949      240 gms.      December 20, 1949      260 gms.      February 18, 1950      230 gms.      April 5, 1950          290 gms.      April 7, 1950          300 gms.      October 7, 1950        320 gms.      November 29, 1950      345 gms.      March 23, 1951         340 gms.    Another example, showing winter cessation of growth in a male at even  smaller size is shown below. This was in the winter of 1950-1951.        November 9             145 gms.      November 28            175 gms.      November 29            165 gms.      January 10             180 gms.      January 11             175 gms.      March 1                225 gms.      March 23               200 gms.      _Longevity_    The longest span of records for an individual woodrat recorded was 991  days in a female, already adult when she was first caught on November  18, 1948. Other relatively long spans of records were: 827 days in a  male, adult when first caught on March 16, 1952; 754 days in a female,  also adult when first captured; 649 days in a male first captured as a  juvenile; 465 days in a male, adult when first captured; 409 days in a  male, juvenile when first captured; 399 days in a female, juvenile when  first captured; 395 days in a female, adult when first captured; 390  days in a female, adult when first captured; 366 days in a male, adult  when first captured. Of these eleven individuals (six females and five  males) whose records cover more than a year, eight were already adult  when first caught. These eleven rats represent only 4.3 per cent of the  total number captured. Our study was made at a time when populations  were shrinking and disappearing, and obviously individual spans would  have been longer if we had been working with a stable population. In  most instances the spans of our records represent only small parts of  the life spans of the individuals involved. Nevertheless, our records  emphasize the potentially greater longevity of the woodrat as contrasted  with the various smaller rodents living in the same area. Of several  thousand individuals of the genera _Mus_, _Zapus_, _Reithrodontomys_,  _Peromyscus_, _Sigmodon_, and especially _Microtus_, none is known to  have survived so long as two years, and only a few individuals are known  to have survived so long as one year after being marked.      _Summary_    Plant succession resulting from land use practices created habitat  conditions especially favorable for woodrats in the late nineteen  forties in northeastern Kansas, and particularly on the University of  Kansas Natural History Reservation. With protection from prairie fires,  woody vegetation had encroached onto areas that were formerly grassland,  and, later, fencing against livestock permitted dense thickets of  undergrowth to develop. In this region the woodrat usually lives in a  forest habitat, and requires for its house sites places that are  especially well sheltered, as in matted thickets of undergrowth, root  tangles exposed along eroded gully banks, hollow stumps or tree trunks,  bases of thorny trees with multiple trunks for support, thick tops of  fallen trees, or, especially, rock outcrops with deep crevices.    At the time of their maximum population density in or about 1947,  woodrats probably averaged several per acre on the woodland parts of the  Reservation. In the autumn of 1948, 17 were caught on the ten-acre tract  of woodland that was live-trapped most intensively. By then, however,  the population had already undergone drastic reduction, as shown by the  fact that there were many unoccupied and disintegrating houses  throughout the woodland. While the time and manner of mortality was not  definitely determined, circumstantial evidence suggests that the  downward trend began in early March, 1948, when record low temperatures  and unusually heavy snowfall coincided with the time when parturition  normally occurs. The rigorous weather conditions then may have been  injurious, not only to the newborn litters but to the females comprising  the breeding stock. Nevertheless, the population remained moderately  high through 1948, but by early spring of 1949 more than three-fourths  of the adults and subadults present in late autumn had been eliminated.  Again, unusually severe winter weather seemed to be the underlying  cause, as in January precipitation was the heaviest on record in 81  years, with penetrating sleet storms, persistent ice glaze, and  occasional brief thawing followed by sudden drops to extremely low  temperature.    After the drastic reduction in the winter of 1948-49, the population did  not recover. Although no further sudden reductions due to extremes of  weather were noted, the trend seemed to be one of gradual, progressive  decline throughout the following period of years. Deterioration of the  habitat, as the developing forest shaded out undergrowth, and inroads of  certain predators may have been important in preventing recovery of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33619"],[0,"Maori and Settler: A Story of The New Zealand War (#8)"],[1,"great  satisfaction, felt so far no symptoms whatever of impending illness. The  two Allens were obliged to keep on deck during the meal, being unable to  stand the motion below; but they were well enough to enjoy the cup of  tea and plate of cold meat Wilfrid carried up to them. An hour or two  later they went below. The wind was rising and the sea hourly getting  up. Marion came up after breakfast, and for some time afterwards walked  up and down on the deck with Wilfrid enjoying the brisk air, and  considering it great fun to try to walk straight up and down the swaying  deck. Presently, however, her laugh became subdued and her cheeks lost  their colour.    \"I am afraid I am going to be ill, Wilfrid; but I shall stay on deck if  I can. Both the Mitfords are ill, I am sure, for neither of them got up,  though they declared that they felt nothing the matter with them. I have  made up my mind to stay on deck as long as I possibly can.\"    \"That is the best way,\" Mr. Atherton said as he joined them in their  walk, and caught the last sentence. \"There is nothing like keeping up as  long as possible; because if you do so it will sometimes pass off after  a short time, whereas if you give up and take to your berth it is sure  to run its course, which is longer or shorter according to  circumstances--sometimes two days and sometimes five; but I should say  that people who are what you may call fair sailors generally get over it  in two days, unless the weather is very bad. So fight against it as long  as you can, and when you cannot bear it any longer I will wrap you up in  rugs, and you shall have my great chair to curl up in close by the lee  bulwark. But determination goes a long way, and you may get over it yet.  You take my arm, you won't throw me off my balance; while if the vessel  gives a sharper roll than usual, you and your brother may both lose your  feet together.\"    As soon as they started on their walk Mr. Atherton began an amusing  story of some adventure of his in the Western States of America, and  Marion was so interested that she forgot all about her uncomfortable  sensation, and was astonished when on hearing the lunch-bell ring she  discovered she was getting perfectly well.    \"Where is Wilfrid?\" she asked.    \"There he is, leaning over the lee bulwark; the fiend of sea-sickness  has him in its grip.\"    \"Only think of Wilfrid being unwell and me being all right! You have  quite driven it away, Mr. Atherton, for I was feeling very poorly when I  began to walk with you.\"    \"I will go down and get you some luncheon and bring it up here to you.  Curl yourself up in my chair until I return, and do not think more about  the motion than you can help. You had better not go near your  brother--people who are ill hate being pitied.\"    An hour later Wilfrid went below. In the evening, however, the wind  dropped considerably, and the next morning the sea was sparkling in the  sunlight, and the _Flying Scud_ was making her way along with a scarcely  perceptible motion. Thenceforth the weather was delightful throughout  the voyage to Rio. The passengers found upon closer acquaintance that  they all got on well together, and the days passed away pleasantly. In  the evenings the piano was brought up from the cabin on to the deck, and  for two or three hours there was singing, varied by an occasional dance  among the young people.    From the day of their leaving England Mr. Atherton had been the leading  spirit on board the ship. If a misunderstanding arose he acted as  mediator. He was ever ready to propose pastimes and amusements to  lighten the monotony of the voyage, took the leading part in the  concerts held on deck when the evenings were calm and clear, and was  full of resource and invention. With the four or five children on board  he was prime favourite, and Mr. Renshaw often wondered at the patience  and good temper with which he submitted to all their whims, and was  ready to give up whatever he was doing to submit himself to their  orders. He had, before they had been ten days at sea, talked over with  Mr. Renshaw the latter's plans, and advised him upon no account to be in  a hurry to snap up the first land offered to him.    \"Half the people who come out to the colonies,\" he said, \"get heavily  bit at first by listening to the land-agents, and allowing themselves to  be persuaded into buying property which, when they come to take  possession of it, is in a majority of the cases almost worthless. I  should advise you when you get there to hire a house in Wellington,  where you can leave your wife and daughter while you examine the various  districts and see which offer the greatest advantages. If you do not  feel equal to it yourself, let your son go in your place. He is, I  think, a sharp young fellow, and not likely to be easily taken in. At  any rate, when he has made his report as to the places that seem most  suitable, you can go and see their relative advantages before  purchasing.    \"'There is no greater mistake than buying land in a locality of which  you know nothing. You may find that the roads are impracticable and that  you have no means of getting your produce to market, and after a while  you will be glad to sell your place for a mere song and shift to another  which you might at first have obtained at a price much lower than you  gave for your worthless farm. I have knocked about in the States a good  deal, and have known scores of men ruined by being too hasty in making a  choice. You want to be in a colony six months at least before investing  your money in land, so as to know something of the capabilities and  advantages of each district. To a young man I should say--travel about  in the colony, working your way, and making a stay of a month here and a  month there. Of course in your case this is out of the question; but a  personal examination of the places offered to you, which in nine cases  out of ten men are ready to sell for less than they have cost them, will  ensure you against absolute swindling.\"    \"What are you going to do yourself, Mr. Atherton?\"    \"I have come out simply to study the botany of the island. I may stay in  the colony for a month or for a year. At any rate, if you depute Wilfrid  to travel about to examine the various districts where land can be  bought, I shall be glad to accompany him, as I myself shall also be on  the look-out.\"    \"You are not thinking of farming, Mr. Atherton?\"    \"No. My own idea is to take a bit of land on one of the rivers, to get  up a hut to serve as my head-quarters, and to spend much of my time in  travelling about. I am very fortunately placed. I have ample funds to  enable me to live in comfort, and I am free to indulge my fancy for  wandering as I please. I consider that I have been spoiled by being my  own master too young. I think it is bad for a young man to start in life  with a competence; but when it comes to one in middle age, when one has  learned to spend it rationally, it is undoubtedly a very great comfort  and advantage. I suppose, however, that the time will come when I shall  settle down. I am thirty-five, and I ought to 'range myself,' as the  French say.\"    Mr. Atherton had not been long upon the voyage when he discovered that  the chances of success of the Renshaw party as settlers would be small  indeed if they depended upon the exertions of the head of the family. He  had not been more than a day or two on board before Mr. Renshaw began to  discuss his favourite hobby with him, and confided to him that he  intended thoroughly to investigate the history, customs, and religion of  the Maoris, and to produce an exhaustive work on the subject. \"An  excellent idea, very,\" the stout man said encouragingly, \"but one  demanding great time and investigation; and perhaps,\" he added  doubtfully, \"one more suited to a single man, who can go and live among  the natives and speak their language, than for a married man with a  family to look after.\"    Mr. Renshaw waved the remark aside lightly. \"I shall, of course, set to  work immediately I arrive to acquire a thorough knowledge of the  language, and indeed have already begun with a small dictionary and a  New Testament in the Maori language, brought out by the Missionary  Society. As to my family, my exertions in the farming way will be of no  use whatever to them. My wife and daughter will look after the house,  and Wilfrid will undertake the management of the men out of doors. The  whole scheme is theirs, and I should be of no assistance to them  whatever. My bent lies entirely in the direction of archaeology, and  there can be little doubt that my thorough acquaintance with all  relating to the habits, and, so far as is known, of the language of the  ancient Britons, Saxons, Danes, and the natives of the northern part of  the island, will be of inestimable advantage in enabling me to carry out  the subject I have resolved to take up. There are analogies and  similarities between the habits of all primitive peoples, and one  accustomed to the study of the early races of Europe can form a general  opinion of the habits and mode of living of a tribe merely from the  inspection of an ancient weapon or two, a bracelet, and a potsherd.\"    Mr. Atherton looked down upon his companion with half-closed eyes, and  seemed to be summing him up mentally; after a short conversation he  turned away, and as he filled his pipe muttered to himself: \"It is well  for the family that the mother seems a capable and sensible woman, and  that the lad, unless I am mistaken, has a dogged resolution about him as  well as spirit and courage. The girl, too, is a bright sensible lass,  and they may get on in spite of this idiot of a father. However, the man  shows that he possesses a certain amount of sense by the confidence with  which he throws the burden of the whole business of providing a living  for the family on their shoulders.    \"Of course they would be much better"]]]
