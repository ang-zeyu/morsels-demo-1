Did Pitkin tell you he would pay you  five dollars a week.\"    \"No; Mr Carter told me so.\"    \"The old gentleman--Mr. Pitkin's uncle?\"    \"Yes. It was at his request that Mr. Pitkin took me on.\"    Mr. Wilbur looked grave.    \"It's a shame!\" he commenced.    \"What is a shame; that I should get five dollars a week?\"    \"No, but that I should only get a dollar a week more than an errand boy.  I'm worth every cent of ten dollars a week, but the old man only gives  me six. It hardly keeps me in gloves and cigars.\"    \"Won't he give you any more?\"    \"No; only last month I asked him for a raise, and he told me if I wasn't  satisfied I might go elsewhere.\"    \"You didn't?\"    \"No, but I mean to soon. I will show old Pitkin that he can't keep a man  of my experience for such a paltry salary. I dare say that Denning or  Claflin would be glad to have me, and pay me what I am worth.\"    Phil did not want to laugh, but when Mr. Wilbur, who looked scarcely  older than himself, and was in appearance but a callow youth, referred  to himself as a man of experience he found it hard to resist.    \"Hadn't we better be going up stairs?\" asked Phil.    \"All right. Follow me,\" said Mr. Wilbur, \"and I'll take you to the  superintendent of the room.\"    \"I am to report to Mr. Pitkin himself, I believe.\"    \"He won't be here yet awhile,\" said Wilbur.    But just then up came Mr. Wilbur himself, fully half an hour earlier  than usual.    Phil touched his hat politely, and said:    \"Good-morning.\"    \"Good-morning!\" returned his employer, regarding him sharply. \"Are you  the boy I hired yesterday?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Come up-stairs, then.\"    Phil followed Mr. Pitkin up-stairs, and they walked together through the  sales-room.    \"I hope you understand,\" said Mr. Pitkin brusquely, \"that I have engaged  you at the request of Mr. Carter and to oblige him.\"    \"I feel grateful to Mr. Carter,\" said Phil, not quite knowing what was  coming next.    \"I shouldn't myself have engaged a boy of whom I knew nothing, and who  could give me no city references.\"    \"I hope you won't be disappointed in me,\" said Phil.    \"I hope not,\" answered Mr. Pitkin, in a tone which seemed to imply that  he rather expected to be.    Phil began to feel uncomfortable. It seemed evident that whatever he did  would be closely scrutinized, and that in an unfavorable spirit.    Mr. Pitkin paused before a desk at which was standing a stout man with  grayish hair.    \"Mr. Sanderson,\" he said, \"this is the new errand boy. His name is--what  is it, boy?\"    \"Philip Brent.\"    \"You will give him something to do. Has the mail come in?\"    \"No; we haven't sent to the post-office yet.\"    \"You may send this boy at once.\"    Mr. Sanderson took from the desk a key and handed it to Philip.    \"That is the key to our box,\" he said. \"Notice the number--534. Open it  and bring the mail. Don't loiter on the way.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    Philip took the key and left the warehouse. When he reached the street  he said to himself:    \"I wonder where the post-office is?\"    He did not like to confess to Mr. Sanderson that he did not know, for  it would probably have been considered a disqualification for the post  which he was filling.    \"I had better walk to Broadway,\" he said to himself. \"I suppose the  post-office must be on the principal street.\"    In this Phil was mistaken. At that time the post-office was on Nassau  Street, in an old church which had been utilized for a purpose very  different from the one to which it had originally been devoted.    Reaching Broadway, Phil was saluted by a bootblack, with a grimy but  honest-looking face.    \"Shine your boots, mister?\" said the boy, with a grin.    \"Not this morning.\"    \"Some other morning, then?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Phil.    \"Sorry you won't give me a job,\" said the bootblack. \"My taxes comes due  to-day, and I ain't got enough to pay 'em.\"    Phil was amused, for his new acquaintance scarcely looked like a heavy  taxpayer.    \"Do you pay a big tax?\" he asked.    \"A thousand dollars or less,\" answered the knight of the brush.    \"I guess it's less,\" said Phil.    \"That's where your head's level, young chap.\"    \"Is the post-office far from here?\"    \"Over half a mile, I reckon.\"    \"Is it on this street?\"    \"No, it's on Nassau Street.\"    \"If you will show me the way there I'll give you ten cents.\"    \"All right! The walk'll do me good. Come on!\"    \"What's your name?\" asked Phil, who had become interested in his new  acquaintance.    \"The boys call me Ragged Dick.\"    It was indeed the lively young bootblack whose history was afterward  given in a volume which is probably familiar to many of my readers. At  this time he was only a bootblack, and had not yet begun to feel the  spur of that ambition which led to his subsequent prosperity.    \"That's a queer name,\" said Phil.    \"I try to live up to it,\" said Dick, with a comical glance at his ragged  coat, which had originally been worn by a man six feet in height.    He swung his box over his shoulder, and led the way to the old  post-office.        CHAPTER XII.    MR. LIONEL LAKE AGAIN.    Phil continued his conversation with Ragged Dick, and was much amused by  his quaint way of expressing himself.    When they reached Murray Street, Dick said:    \"Follow me. We'll cut across the City Hall Park. It is the shortest  way.\"    Soon they reached the shabby old building with which New Yorkers were  then obliged to be content with as a post-office.    Phil secured the mail matter for Pitkin & Co., and was just about  leaving the office, when he noticed just ahead of him a figure which  looked very familiar.    It flashed upon him of a sudden that it was his old train acquaintance,  Lionel Lake. He immediately hurried forward and touched his arm.    Mr. Lake, who had several letters in his hand, started nervously, and  turned at the touch. He recognized Phil, but appeared not to do so.    \"What do you wish, boy?\" he asked, loftily.    \"I want to speak a word with you, Mr. Lake.\"    The young man shrugged his shoulders.    \"You are mistaken in the person,\" he said. \"My name is not Lake.\"    \"Very likely not,\" said Phil significantly, \"but that's what you called  yourself when we met on the train.\"    \"I repeat, boy, that you are strangely mistaken. My name is\"--he paused  slightly--\"John Montgomery.\"    \"Just as you please. Whatever your name is, I have a little business  with you.\"    \"I can't stop. My business is urgent,\" said Lake.    \"Then I will be brief. I lent you five dollars on a ring which I  afterward discovered to be stolen. I want you to return that money.\"    Mr. Lake looked about him apprehensively, for he did not wish any one to  hear what Phil was saying.    \"You must be crazy!\" he said. \"I never saw you before in the whole  course of my life.\"    He shook off Phil's detaining hand, and was about to hurry away, but  Phil said resolutely:    \"You can't deceive me, Mr. Lake. Give me that money, or I will call a  policeman.\"    Now, it happened that a policeman was passing just outside, and Lake  could see him.    \"This is an infamous outrage!\" he said, \"but I have an important  appointment, and can't be detained. Take the money. I give it to you in  charity.\"    Phil gladly received and pocketed the bank-note, and relinquishing his  hold of Mr. Lake, rejoined Dick, who had been an interested eye-witness  of the interview.    \"I see you've got pluck,\" said Dick. \"What's it all about?\"    Phil told him.    \"I ain't a bit s'prised,\" said Dick. \"I could tell by his looks that the  man was a skin.\"    \"Well, I'm even with him, at any rate,\" said Phil.    \"Now I'll be getting back to the office. Thank you for your guidance.  Here's a quarter.\"    \"You only promised me ten cents.\"    \"It's worth a quarter. I hope to meet you again.\"    \"We'll meet at Astor's next party,\" said Dick, with a grin. \"My invite  came yesterday.\"    \"Mine hasn't come yet,\" said Phil, smiling.    \"Maybe it'll come to-morrow.\"    \"He's a queer chap,\" thought Phil. \"He's fit for something better than  blacking boots. I hope he'll have the luck to get it.\"    Phil had been detained by his interview with Mr. Lake, but he made up  for it by extra speed, and reached the warehouse in fair time. After  delivering the letters he was sent out on another errand, and during the  entire day he was kept busy.    Leaving him for the moment we go back to the Pitkin mansion, and listen  to & conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Pitkin.    \"Uncle Oliver is getting more and more eccentric every day,\" said the  lady. \"He brought home a boy to lunch to-day--some one whom he had  picked up in the street.\"    \"Was the boy's name Philip Brent?\" asked her husband.    \"Yes, I believe so. What do you know about him?\" asked the lady in  surprise.    \"I have engaged him as errand boy.\"    \"You have! What for?\" exclaimed Mrs. Pitkin.    \"I couldn't help it. He brought a letter from your uncle, requesting me  to do so, and offering to pay his wages out of his own pocket.\"    \"This is really getting very serious,\" said Mrs. Pitkin, annoyed.  \"Suppose he should take a fancy to this boy?\"    \"He appears to have done so already,\" said her husband dryly.    \"I mean, suppose he should adopt him?\"    \"You are getting on pretty fast, Lavinia, are you not?\"    \"Such things happen sometimes,\" said the lady, nodding. \"If it should  happen it would be bad for poor Lonny.\"    \"Even in that case Lonny won't have to go to the poor-house.\"    \"Mr. Pitkin, you don't realize the danger. Here's Uncle Oliver worth a  quarter of a million dollars, and it ought to be left to us.\"    \"Probably it will be.\"    \"He may leave it all to this boy. This must be prevented.\"    \"How?\"    \"You must say the boy doesn't suit you, and discharge him.\"    \"Well, well, give me time. I have no objection; but I suspect it will be  hard to find any fault with him. He looks like a reliable boy.\"    \"To me he looks like an artful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46202"],[0,"A New Witness for God (Volume 1 of 3) (#8)"],[1,"nature.\" Renan defines a miracle  to be, \"not simply the inexplicable, it is a formal derogation from  recognized laws in the name of a particular desire.\" What is especially  faulty in these definitions is this: Miracles are held to be outside or  contrary to the laws of nature. Let us examine this. Two hundred years  ago the only motive powers known to ocean navigators were wind and the  ocean currents. Suppose at that time those old mariners had seen one  of our modern ocean steamers running against both ocean currents and  the wind; and, withal, making better speed in spite of both wind and  tide than the old time sailing vessel could even when running before  the wind and the ocean currents in her favor. What would have been  the effect of such a sight on the mind of the old-time sailor? \"It is  a miracle!\" he would have exclaimed; that is, it would have been an  \"effect contrary to the established constitution and course of things,\"  \"a derogation from recognized laws.\" But is such an effect to us who  know something of the force of steam contrary to the laws of nature?  No; it is simply the employment of forces in nature of which the  old-time mariner was ignorant; and while it would have been a miracle  to him, to us it is merely the application of a newly discovered  force of nature, and it is now so common that we cease to look upon  it with wonder. So with the things that we now in our ignorance call  miracles--such as the healing of the sick, restoring the blind to  sight, making the lame to walk, through the exercise of faith, and the  resurrection of the dead--instead of these things being in \"derogation  from recognized laws,\" we shall yet learn that they are done simply by  the application of laws of which we are as yet in ignorance. With man's  limited knowledge of the laws of nature, how presumptuous it is in him  to say that the healing of the sick or even the resurrection of the  dead are in \"derogation of the laws of nature,\" or that deviation from  those few laws of nature with which he is acquainted will never happen,  or is impossible! Better reasoners are they who, like George Rawlinson,  say, \"Miraculous interpositions on fitting occasions may be as much a  regular, fixed, and established rule of his (God's) government as the  working ordinarily by what are called natural laws.\" In other words,  what we in our ignorance call miracles, are to God merely the results  of the application of higher laws or forces of nature not yet learned  by man. Miracles are to be viewed as a part of the divine economy.    20. It will be observed that throughout a difference between myth and  legend is recognized. Strauss thus distinguishes between them: \"Mythus  is the creation of a fact out of an idea; legend the seeing of an idea  in a fact, or arising out of it.\" \"The myth is therefore pure and  absolute imagination,\" says Rawlinson; \"the legend has a basis of fact,  but amplifies, abridges, or modifies that basis at its pleasure.\" And  thus De Wette: \"The myth is an idea in a vestment of facts; the legend  contains facts pervaded and transformed by ideas.\"    21. All this and a hundred other things equally silly and untrue which  mar rather than dignify the character of Jesus Christ are related  in the \"First Gospel of the Infancy,\" translated by Mr. Henry Sike,  professor of Oriental Languages at Cambridge. \"The Infancy\" was  accepted by the Gnostics, a Christian sect of the second century.    22. \"Life of Jesus\" (Renan), p. 50, E. T.    23. \"Life of Jesus\" (Strauss), vol. III., p. 434, E. T.    24. \"Upon the whole, I accept the four canonical gospels as authentic.  All, in my judgment, date back to the first century, and they are  substantially by the authors to whom they are attributed.\" \"Renan's  Life of Jesus,\" Introduction, p. 34, E. T.    25. \"Let the Gospels be in part legendary, that is evident since they  are full of miracles and the supernatural. . . . . The historic value  which I attribute to the Gospels is now, I think, quite understood.  They are neither biographies, after the manner of Suetonius, nor  fictitious legends, like those of Philostratus; they are legendary  biographies.\" Renan, \"Life of Jesus,\" Introduction, p. 17 38.    26. \"Till we have new light, we shall maintain, therefore, this  principle of historical criticism, that a supernatural relation cannot  be accepted as such, that it always implies credulity or imposture,  that the duty of the historian is to interpret it, and to seek what  portion of truth and what portion error it may contain. Such are the  rules which have been followed in this life\" (of Christ). Renan, \"Life  of Jesus,\" p. 45, E.

The triumphant language of Dr. Briggs in the _North American  Review_ is: \"The majority of votes in favor of the suspension was very  great. But if the votes are weighed as well as counted the disparity  will not be regarded as serious. The basis of representation in the  general assembly gives the small presbyteries in the country districts  and on the frontiers a vastly greater power than they are entitled  to by their numbers or influence, while the strong presbyteries in  our large cities and in the great communities are put at a serious  disadvantage. The general assemblies, as they are now constituted,  represent the least intelligent portion of the church, and not  unfrequently a majority in the Assembly really represents a minority of  the ministers and people in the denomination. A majority of a general  assembly is not taken seriously by intelligent Presbyterians.\"    34. \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\"    35.

The Church of Christ Was Destroyed: There Has Been an Apostasy from the  Christian Religion, So Complete and Universal, as to Make Necessary a  New Dispensation of the Gospel.        CHAPTER II.    THE EFFECT OF PAGAN PERSECUTION ON THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH.    A variety of causes have operated to produce the result stated in  my second Thesis, among which I shall first consider those terrible  persecutions with which the saints were afflicted in the first  centuries of our era.    Let it not be a matter of surprise that I class those persecutions  as among the means through which the church was destroyed. The force  of heathen rage was aimed at the leaders and strong men of the body  religious; and being long-continued and relentlessly cruel, those  most steadfast in their adherence to the church invariably became its  victims. These being stricken down, it left none but weaklings to  contend for the faith, and made possible those subsequent innovations  in the religion of Jesus which a pagan public sentiment demanded, and  which so completely changed both the spirit and form of the Christian  religion as to subvert it utterly.    Let me further ask that no one be surprised that violence is permitted  to operate in such a case. The idea that the right is always victorious  in this world; that truth is always triumphant and innocence always  divinely protected, are old, fond fables with which well-meaning men  have amused credulous multitudes; but the stern facts of history  and actual experience in life correct the pleasing delusion. Do not  misunderstand me. I believe in the ultimate victory of the right,  the ultimate triumph of truth, the final immunity of innocence from  violence. These--innocence, truth and the right--will be at the last  more than conquerors; they will be successful in the war, but that does  not prevent them from losing some battles. It should be remembered  always that God has given to man his agency; and that fact implies that  one man is as free to act wickedly as another is to do righteousness.  Cain was as free to murder his brother as that brother was to worship  God; and so the pagans and Jews were as free to persecute and murder  the Christians as the Christians were to live virtuously and worship  Christ as God. The agency of man would not be worth the name if it did  not grant liberty to the wicked to fill the cup of their iniquity,  as well as liberty to the virtuous to round out the measure of their  righteousness. Such perfect liberty or agency God has given man; and it  is only so variously modified as not to thwart his general purposes.  Hence it comes that even when stealthy Murder in sight of his helpless  victim meditates the crime, no voice to prevent the act \"speaks through  the blanket of the dark\" crying, \"Hold! hold!\" Of course it follows  that running parallel with this fact of man's liberty is the solemn  truth of his full responsibility for the use he makes of it.    In the light of these reflections, then, I say that after Christ, as  before his day, the kingdom of heaven suffered violence and the violent  took it by force. [1] How far that violence, as manifested in the  persecutions of the first three Christian centuries, was effectual as  a factor in causing the destruction of the church is now to engage our  attention.    At the outset, however, there is a difficulty I cannot pass without  comment--the disagreement of eminent writers on the extent and severity  of the persecutions endured by the Christians up to the accession of  Constantine to the imperial throne of Rome. On the one hand infidel  writers, such as Gibbon and Dodwell, have sought to minimize the  suffering of the Christians under the persecutions, and on the other,  Christian writers, such as Milner,"]]]
