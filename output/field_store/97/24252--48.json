Both are physical as well as  mental. Often it is the destruction of the nerve tissues by concussion,  or actual physical damage to the brain; sometimes it is a shock of  horror unbalancing the mind, but that is more rare. It is not generally  the slight, nervous men who suffer worst from shell-shock. It is often  the stolid fellow, one of those we describe as being utterly without  nerves, who goes down badly. Something snaps in him. He has no  resilience in his nervous system. He has never trained himself in  nerve-control, being so stolid and self-reliant. Now, the nervous man,  the cockney, for example, is always training himself in the control of  his nerves, on 'buses which lurch round corners, in the traffic that  bears down on him, in a thousand and one situations which demand  self-control in a 'nervy' man. That helps him in war; whereas the yokel,  or the sergeant--major type, is splendid until the shock comes. Then  he may crack. But there is no law. Imagination--apprehension--are the  devil, too, and they go with 'nerves.'\"    It was a sergeant-major whom I saw stricken badly with shell-shock in  Aveluy Wood near Thiepval. He was convulsed with a dreadful rigor like  a man in epilepsy, and clawed at his mouth, moaning horribly, with livid  terror in his eyes. He had to be strapped to a stretcher before he  could be carried away. He had been a tall and splendid man, this poor,  terror-stricken lunatic.    Nearer to Thiepval, during the fighting there, other men were brought  down with shell-shock. I remember one of them now, though I saw many  others. He was a Wiltshire lad, very young, with an apple-cheeked face  and blue-gray eyes. He stood outside a dugout, shaking in every limb, in  a palsied way. His steel hat was at the back of his head and his mouth  slobbered, and two comrades could not hold him still.    These badly shell-shocked boys clawed their mouths ceaselessly. It was a  common, dreadful action. Others sat in the field hospitals in a state  of coma, dazed, as though deaf, and actually dumb. I hated to see them,  turned my eyes away from them, and yet wished that they might be seen  by bloody-minded men and women who, far behind the lines, still spoke of  war lightly, as a kind of sport, or heroic game, which brave boys liked  or ought to like, and said, \"We'll fight on to the last man rather than  accept anything less than absolute victory,\" and when victory came  said: \"We stopped too soon. We ought to have gone on for another three  months.\" It was for fighting-men to say those things, because they knew  the things they suffered and risked. That word \"we\" was not to be used  by gentlemen in government offices scared of air raids, nor by women  dancing in scanty frocks at war-bazaars for the \"poor dear wounded,\"  nor even by generals at G. H. Q., enjoying the thrill of war without its  dirt and danger.    Seeing these shell-shock cases month after month, during years of  fighting, I, as an onlooker, hated the people who had not seen, and were  callous of this misery; the laughing girls in the Strand greeting the  boys on seven days' leave; the newspaper editors and leader-writers  whose articles on war were always \"cheery\"; the bishops and clergy who  praised God as the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied armies, and had  never said a word before the war to make it less inevitable; the  schoolmasters who gloried in the lengthening \"Roll of Honor\" and said,  \"We're doing very well,\" when more boys died; the pretty woman-faces  ogling in the picture-papers, as \"well--known war-workers\"; the  munition-workers who were getting good wages out of the war; the  working-women who were buying gramophones and furs while their men were  in the stinking trenches; the dreadful, callous, cheerful spirit of  England at war.    Often I was unfair, bitter, unbalanced, wrong. The spirit of England,  taking it broad and large--with dreadful exceptions--was wonderful in  its courage and patience, and ached with sympathy for its fighting sons,  and was stricken with the tragedy of all this slaughter. There were many  tears in English homes; many sad and lonely women. But, as an onlooker,  I could not be just or fair, and hated the non-combatants who did not  reveal its wound in their souls, but were placid in their belief that we  should win, and pleased with themselves because of their easy optimism.  So easy for those who did not see!          XV      As war correspondents we were supposed to have honorary rank as  captains, by custom and tradition--but it amounted to nothing, here  or there. We were civilians in khaki, with green bands round our right  arms, and uncertain status. It was better so, because we were in the  peculiar and privileged position of being able to speak to Tommies and  sergeants as human beings, to be on terms of comradeship with junior  subalterns and battalion commanders, and to sit at the right hand of  generals without embarrassment to them or to ourselves.    Physically, many of our generals were curiously alike. They were men  turned fifty, with square jaws, tanned, ruddy faces, searching and  rather stern gray eyes, closely cropped hair growing white, with a  little white mustache, neatly trimmed, on the upper lip.    Mentally they had similar qualities. They had unfailing physical  courage--though courage is not put to the test much in modern  generalship, which, above the rank of brigadier, works far from the  actual line of battle, unless it \"slips\" in the wrong direction. They  were stern disciplinarians, and tested the quality of troops by their  smartness in saluting and on parade, which did not account for the  fighting merit of the Australians. Most of them were conservative by  political tradition and hereditary instinct, and conservative also in  military ideas and methods. They distrusted the \"brilliant\" fellow,  and were inclined to think him unsafe; and they were not quick to allow  young men to gain high command at the expense of their gray hair and  experience. They were industrious, able, conscientious men, never  sparing themselves long hours of work for a life of ease, and because  they were willing to sacrifice their own lives, if need be, for their  country's sake, they demanded equal willingness of sacrifice from every  officer and man under their authority, having no mercy whatever for the  slacker or the weakling.    Among them there was not one whose personality had that mysterious but  essential quality of great generalship--inspiring large bodies of men  with exalted enthusiasm, devotion, and faith. It did not matter to  the men whether an army commander, a corps commander, or a divisional  commander stood in the roadside to watch them march past on their way  to battle or on their way back. They saw one of these sturdy men in his  brass hat, with his ruddy face and white mustache, but no thrill passed  down their ranks, no hoarse cheers broke from them because he was there,  as when Wellington sat on his white horse in the Peninsular War, or as  when Napoleon saluted his Old Guard, or even as when Lord Roberts, \"Our  Bob,\" came perched like a little old falcon on his big charger.    Nine men out of ten in the ranks did not even know the name of their  army general or of the corps commander. It meant nothing to them. They  did not face death with more passionate courage to win the approval of a  military idol. That was due partly to the conditions of modern warfare,  which make it difficult for generals of high rank to get into direct  personal touch with their troops, and to the masses of men engaged. But  those difficulties could have been overcome by a general of impressive  personality, able to stir the imaginations of men by words of fire  spoken at the right time, by deep, human sympathy, and by the luck of  victory seized by daring adventure against great odds.    No such man appeared on the western front until Foch obtained the  supreme command. On the British front there was no general with the gift  of speech--a gift too much despised by our British men of action--or  with a character and prestige which could raise him to the highest rank  in popular imagination. During the retreat from Mona, Sir John French  had a touch of that personal power--his presence meant something to  the men because of his reputation in South Africa; but afterward, when  trench warfare began, and the daily routine of slaughter under German  gun-fire, when our artillery was weak, and when our infantry was ordered  to attack fixed positions of terrible strength without adequate support,  and not a dog's chance of luck against such odds, the prestige of the  Commander-in-Chief faded from men's minds and he lost place in their  admiration. It was washed out in blood and mud.    Sir Douglas Haig, who followed Sir John French, inherited the  disillusionment of armies who saw now that war on the western front was  to be a long struggle, with enormous slaughter, and no visible sign  of the end beyond a vista of dreadful years. Sir Douglas Haig, in his  general headquarters at St.-Omer, and afterward at Montreuil, near the  coast, had the affection and loyalty of the staff--officers. A man of  remarkably good looks, with fine, delicate features, strengthened by  the firm line of his jaw, and of singular sweetness, courtesy, and  simplicity in his manner toward all who approached him, he had qualities  which might have raised him to the supreme height of personal influence  among his armies but for lack of the magic touch and the tragic  condition of his command.    He was intensely shy and reserved, shrinking from publicity and holding  himself aloof from the human side of war. He was constitutionally unable  to make a dramatic gesture before a multitude, or to say easy, stirring  things to officers and men whom he reviewed. His shyness and reserve  prevented him also from knowing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],[0,"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#8)"],[1,", whose name was Lelaps.  No sooner was the  dog let loose than he darted off, quicker than their eye could  follow him.  If they had not seen his footprints in the sand they  would have thought he flew.  Cephalus and others stood on a hill  and saw the race.  The fox tried every art; he ran in a circle  and turned on his track, the dog close upon him, with open jaws,  snapping at his heels, but biting only the air.  Cephalus was  about to use his javelin, when suddenly he saw both dog and game  stop instantly.  The heavenly powers who had given both, were not  willing that either should conquer.  In the very attitude of life  and action they were turned into stone.  So lifelike and natural  did they look, you would have thought, as you looked at them,  that one was going to bark, the other to leap forward.    Cephalus, though he had lost his dog, still continued to take  delight in the chase.  He would go out at early morning, ranging  the woods and hills unaccompanied by any one, needing no help,  for his javelin was a sure weapon in all cases.  Fatigued with  hunting, when the sun got high he would seek a shady nook where a  cool stream flowed, and, stretched on the grass with his garments  thrown aside, would enjoy the breeze.  Sometimes he would say  aloud, \"Come, sweet breeze, come and fan my breast, come and  allay the heat that burns me.\"  Some one passing by one day heard  him talking in this way to the air, and, foolishly believing that  he was talking to some maiden, went and told the secret to  Procris, Cephalus's wife.  Love is credulous.  Procris, at the  sudden shock, fainted away.  Presently recovering, she said, \"It  cannot be true; I will not believe it unless I myself am a  witness to it.\"  So she waited, with anxious heart, till the next  morning, when Cephalus went to hunt as usual.  Then she stole out  after him, and concealed herself in the place where the informer  directed her.  Cephalus came as he was wont when tired with  sport, and stretched himself on the green bank, saying, \"Come,  sweet breeze, come and fan me; you know how I love you!  You make  the groves and my solitary rambles delightful.\"  He was running  on in this way when he heard, or thought he heard, a sound as of  a sob in the bushes.  Supposing it some wild animal, he threw hie  javelin at the spot.  A cry from his beloved Procris told him  that the weapon had too surely met its mark.  He rushed to the  place, and found her bleeding and with sinking strength  endeavoring to draw forth from the wound the javelin, her own  gift.  Cephalus raised her from the earth, strove to stanch the  blood, and called her to revive and not to leave him miserable,  to reproach himself with her death.  She opened her feeble eyes,  and forced herself to utter these few words: \"I implore you, if  you have ever loved me, if I have ever deserved kindness at your  hands, my husband, grant me this last request; do not marry that  odious Breeze!\"  This disclosed the whole mystery; but alas!  What advantage to disclose it now?  She died; but her face wore a  calm expression, and she looked pityingly and forgivingly on her  husband when he made her understand the truth.    In Shakespeare's play just quoted, there is an allusion to  Cephalus and Procris, although rather badly spelt.      Pyramus says, \"Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.\"    Thisbe.  \"As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.\"    Moore, in his Legendary Ballads, has one on Cephalus and Procris,  beginning thus:--      \"A hunter once in a grove reclined,    To shun the noon's bright eye,    And oft he wooed the wandering wind    To cool his brow with its sigh.    While mute lay even the wild bee's hum,    Nor breath could stir the aspen's hair,    His song was still, 'Sweet Air, O come!'    While Echo answered, 'Come, sweet Air!'\"        Chapter III    Io and Callisto. Diana and Actaeon. The Story of Phaeton    Jupiter and Juno, although husband and wife, did not live  together very happily.  Jupiter did not love his wife very much,  and Juno distrusted her husband, and was always accusing him of  unfaithfulness.  One day she perceived that it suddenly grew  dark, and immediately suspected that her husband had raised a  cloud to hide some of his doings that would not bear the light.  She brushed away the cloud, and saw her husband, on the banks of  a glassy river, with a beautiful heifer standing near him.  Juno  suspected that the heifer's form concealed some fair nymph of  mortal mould.  This was indeed the case; for it was Io, the  daughter of the river god Inachus, whom Jupiter had been flirting  with, and, when he became aware of the approach of his wife, had  changed into that form.    Juno joined her husband, and noticing the heifer, praised its  beauty, and asked whose it was, and of what herd.  Jupiter, to  stop questions, replied that it was a fresh creation from the  earth.  Juno asked to have it as a gift.  What could Jupiter do?  He was loth to give his mistress to his wife; yet how refuse so  trifling a present as a simple heifer?  He could not, without  arousing suspicion; so he consented.  The goddess was not yet  relieved of her suspicions; and she delivered the heifer to  Argus, to be strictly watched.    Now Argus had a hundred eyes in his head, and never went to sleep  with more than two at a time, so that he kept watch of Io  constantly.  He suffered her to feed through the day, and at  night tied her up with a vile rope round her neck.  She would  have stretched out her arms to implore freedom of Argus, but she  had no arms to stretch out, and her voice was a bellow that  frightened even herself. She saw her father and her sisters, went  near them, and suffered them to pat her back, and heard them  admire her beauty.  Her father reached her a tuft o gras, and she  licked the outstretched hand.  She longed to make herself known  to him, and would have uttered her wish; but, alas!  words were  wanting.  At length she bethought herself of writing, and  inscribed her name   it was a short one   with her hoof on the  sand.  Inachus recognized it, and discovering that his daughter,  whom he had long sought in vain, was hidden under this disguise,  mourned over her, and, embracing her white neck, exclaimed,  \"Alas!  My daughter, it would have been a less grief to have lost  you altogether!\"  While he thus lamented, Argus, observing, came  and drove her away, and took his seat on a high bank, whence he  could see in every direction.    Jupiter was troubled at beholding the sufferings of his mistress,  and calling Mercury, told him to go and despatch Argus.  Mercury  made haste, put his winged slippers on his feet, and cap on his  head, took his sleep-producing wand, and leaped down from the  heavenly towers to the earth.  There he laid aside his wings, and  kept only his wand, with which he presented himself as a shepherd  driving his flock.  As he strolled on he blew upon his pipes.  These were what are called the Syrinx or Pandean pipes.  Argus  listened with delight, for he had never heard the instrument  before.  \"Young man,\" said he, \"come and take a seat by me on  this stone.  There is no better place for your flock to graze in  than hereabouts, and here is a pleasant shade such as shepherds  love.\"  Mercury sat down, talked, and told stories until it grew  late, and played upon his pipes his most soothing strains, hoping  to lull the watchful eyes to sleep, but all in vain; for Argus  still contrived to keep some of his eyes open, though he shut the  rest.    Among other stories, Mercury told him how the instrument on which  he played was invented.  \"There was a certain nymph, whose name  was Syrinx, who was much beloved by the satyrs and spirits of the  wood; but she would have none of them, but was a faithful  worshipper of Diana, and followed the chase.  You would have  thought it was Diana herself, had you seen her in her hunting  dress, only that her bow was of horn and Diana's of silver.  One  day, as she was returning from the chase, Pan met her, told her  just this, and added more of the same sort.  She ran away,  without stopping to hear his compliments, and he pursued till she  came to the bank of the river, where he overtook her, and she had  only time to call for help on her friends, the water nymphs. They  heard and consented.  Pan threw his arms around what he supposed  to be the form of the nymph, and found he embraced only a tuft of  reeds!  As he breathed a sigh, the air sounded through the reeds,  and produced a plaintive melody.  The god, charmed with the  novelty and with the sweetness of the music, said 'Thus, then, at  least, you shall be mine.'  And he took some of the reeds, and  placing them together, of unequal lengths, side by side, made an  instrument which he called Syrinx, in honor of the nymph.\"  Before Mercury had finished his story, he saw Argus's eyes all  asleep.  As his head nodded forward on his breast, Mercury with  one stroke cut his neck through, and tumbled his head down the  rocks.  O hapless Argus!  The light of your hundred eyes is  quenched at once!  Juno took them and put them as ornaments on  the tail of her peacock, where they remain to this day.    But the vengeance of Juno was not yet satiated.  She sent a  gadfly to torment Io, who fled over the whole world from its  pursuit.  She swam through the Ionian Sea, which derived its name  from her, then roamed over the plains of Illyria, ascended Mount  Haemus, and crossed the Thracian strait, thence named the  Bosphorus (cow-bearer), rambled on through Scythia and the  country of the Cimmerians, and arrived at last on the banks of  the Nile.  At length Jupiter interceded for her, and, upon his  promising not to pay her any more attentions, Juno consented to  restore her to her form.  It was curious to see her gradually  recover her former self.  The coarse hairs fell from her body,  her horns shrunk up, her eyes grew narrower, her mouth shorter;  hands and fingers came "]]]
