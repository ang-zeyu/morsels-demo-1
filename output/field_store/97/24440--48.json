In vain were the entreaties of the mate and  his companions for the four or five hands who had possessed themselves  of the key of the spirit room to come on deck and save themselves; they  could neither be persuaded nor forced to move, but lay in a state of  beastly intoxication. Everything had been done that was possible, to  prepare for launching the long boat, and the widow and her daughter had  already by the mate's sanction taken their seats within it, while one of  the seamen secured and carefully stored the few articles of necessity  which had been selected.    The two masts of the boat were stepped and carefully secured, the gripes  that secured the boat in its place were cut, leaving it standing upright  in its wooden bed, but entirely free from the deck of the ship. Already  had the ship sunk so low that all communication with the cabin was cut  off, and the poor inebriated wretches who had there sought oblivion in  intoxication also found their tomb. Food, water and compass were  properly disposed, so that any sudden movement of the boat should not  dislodge them, oars and sails in readiness, and a careful examination  had, lest some straggling rope might in some way connect the boat with  the wreck, so as to draw them under when the floundering mass should at  last go down. The crisis which they now expected seemed strangely  protracted, and their fearful suspense was almost unbearable. The mate  had placed one of his hands at the bows, another amidships, while  himself and the two passengers occupied the stern; the precaution having  also been taken to secure the ladies by ropes to the boat.    The weather had now entirely moderated, and the sea was comparatively  calm, except that now and then a heavy swell would lift the waterlogged  craft and surge about the hull, causing it to groan as though conscious  of its approaching fate. Moments assumed the length of hours now, and  the countenance of each was a picture of agonized suspense and momentary  expectation, no one spoke above their breath. Again the heavy swell  caused the hull to lurch and pitch until her bows were almost buried,  and the water was even with the scuppers--the moment was approaching.    \"Steady, all,\" said the mate, calmly, as he saw another approaching  swell, which he knew must cause the vessel to lift and settle again, and  probably this time prove the signal for her final plunge altogether.  \"Steady, I say, and hold on to the boat stoutly now. Don't let go,  ladies, for an instant!\"    The seaman was right, the heavy hull was ful this surge came on, burying  her for an instant, and actually sweeping the boat clear of her bulwarks  out upon the sea, a most fortunate circumstance, which was instantly  taken advantage of, by pulling with the oars for a single instant, and  still further clearing the wreck, which now rose high at the bows for a  moment as the stern settled and gradually sunk, causing a vortex which  would certainly have engulfed the boat, had it not been able thus to  pull a short distance away, and which even now drew it rapidly back to  the spot where the ship had laid, and causing it to toss fearfully for a  while, but in a few moments more all was quiet.    \"Thank God, that is over,\" said the mate, earnestly; \"it was little  short of a miracle that we did not all of us go down with the ship.\"    The widow covered her face with her hands and breathed a silent prayer  of thankfulness. It was already night again, and steering by the stars  the mate laid his course, after affording a spare sail to cover the  mother and her daughter, who having partaken of some needed refreshment,  the first for many hours, were soon lost in sleep, induced by the great  bodily fatigue and physical exertion they had so lately encountered in  this emergency.    The men stood watch and watch, relieving each other at intervals  throughout the night, while the boat with its two lugger sails crept on  steadily upon its course.    It was remarkable to observe the delicacy observed by those three seamen  towards the widow and her daughter, to mark their assiduity towards them  as to their necessities and their wants; while they, on their part, were  patient, uncomplaining and grateful. The second and third day passed on,  when the mate calculated they were steering direct for the nearest point  of land which they could not fail to reach in another day, it being the  coast of Africa. His calculations were made under disadvantages, but he  felt confident of their correctness. The weather, fortunately, had been  very calm and pleasant thus far, since the gale had subsided, and the  frail craft thus exposed upon the ocean had really proved quite  comfortable and weatherly for the time being. A snug little apology for  a cabin had been constructed over the forward part of the boat, into  which the ladies could retire at nightfall, and become secure from the  weather and be entirely by themselves; and under the circumstances they  were really quite comfortable, that is to say, they experienced little  exposure to the elements at night, and slept securely in their narrow  quarters.    In leaving the ship, the mother had been more thoughtful than many  persons would have been, and had taken the box which contained her  valuables and such papers as comprised her heavy bills of credit on  England, in which way she was transporting the bulk of her husband's  late valuable estate to her native land. At first she had taken especial  pains not to have the fact known to the men that she had any great  amount of valuables with her, lest it should prove a temptation to them,  and lead to some tragical result as it regarded the safety of herself  and child. But she need not have feared, those hearty sons of the ocean  were true as steel; and it was only the second day that having laid the  casket down carelessly in the boat, she had retired to the little  forecastle forgetting it, when it was brought to her again by one of  them who remarked, that he presumed it was something of particular value  by its appearance.    According to the mate's reckoning, the time had already arrived when the  land should heave in sight, and the three seamen were constantly on the  lookout for it in the supposed direction where it should appear; but all  their search for it proved in vain, there was the same endless expanse  of ocean before them day after day, bounded only by the dim horizon, and  unrelieved by any object, while the same hope reigned in their hearts.  The exposure they endured, though not very severe, yet began to tell  upon them all, and especially the mate and two seamen, and the cheeks of  the seamen already looked sunken, their eyes less spirited. This was the  combined result of their feelings of disappointment with physical labor,  for they worked several hours at the oars every day, aiding the sailing  power of the boat, in the hopes of reaching the land before another gale  or storm should occur. Now, however, they began to discard the oars, and  to feel less and less courage to labor in propelling the boat.    The widow who was not a little of a philosopher and a woman of good  sound mind, determined to do something to amuse the men, and cheer them  up in their emergency; she saw how sadly they needed some such  influence, and telling her daughter of her purpose, when night again  came on she induced her to sing some of her sweetest airs with all her  power of execution, and to repeat them to the real joy and delight of  these hardy men, who at once gathered an agency from this music, and  declared it was the harbinger of good. Whether it was so in the way they  supposed or not, it certainly was a harbinger of good as it regarded its  cheering effects upon them, and their hearts were again filled with  hope, and their sinews bent once more to toil at the oars.          CHAPTER VII.    THE SEA WITCH.      WHILE those sweet notes were being uttered under these peculiar  circumstances, and the soft thrilling voice of, the English girl floated  over the sea, and the stars looked down coldly upon those wrecked  adventurers, the mate who sat at the helm was observed to be peering in  the boat's wake, as though looking for some coming object that would  soon overtake them. Leaning over the boat's stern, he placed his cars as  near the surface of the water as possible and listened. This he repeated  several times, with increased earnestness, then partially shading his  eyes with his hands, he gazed back into the dim night air with intense  interest, while the rest in the boat regarded him silently, wondering  what could be the import of his movements.    \"Either there is a big fish in our wake, or I hear the ripple of a  ship's cut-water. But I cannot see hull or canvass in this darkness,\"  said the mate, after a brief but searching gaze in the direction from  whence they had come.    \"It cannot be that you could hear the movement of a ship upon the water,  farther than you could see her even in this light,\" said the mother.    \"It may have been the hauling of a ship's yards, or some rickety block,  but sound I did hear that came from on ship board,\" said the mate, with  assurance.    \"See, see,\" said the daughter, at that moment, \"what is that?\" pointing  off nearly in the wake of the boat into the darkness.    \"A ship!\" said the mate, quickly; \"a ship, as true as heaven!\" adding,  \"shout, shout together now, or she will run us down.\"    As he spoke, all eyes were bent on the dim object that was now fast  approaching them, and steering as nearly on the same course with  themselves as possible. Only a cloud of canvass was visible now, but  soon the dark hull of a vessel appeared, and the mate hastened to light  a lantern and hoist it to attract their attention. The signal was  seemingly observed in an instant on board the stranger, and the hoarse  deep order to heave the ship to, rolled over the waters and rang a  welcome sound in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46751"],[0,"The Strength of the \"Mormon\" Position (#8)"],[1," virtuous men and women who lived before the birth of our  Savior\"--he meets some of the noble characters whom the Apostle Parley  mentions as inhabiting the Spirit World, and the guide says to him:        --\"Inquirest thou not what spirits    Are these, which thou beholdest? Ere thou pass    Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin    Were blameless; and if aught they merited,    It profits not, since baptism was not theirs,    The portal to thy faith. If they before    The Gospel lived, they served not God aright;    And among such am I. For these defects    And for no other evil, we are lost;    Only so far afflicted, that we live    Desiring without hope.\"--Hell, Canto IV, Lines 29-39.    And this was all that Thirteenth Century theology could say for such  men as Homer, Virgil, Plato, Aristotle and others, the best and  brightest spirits of their times!    According to Their Works.    Was it not imperative that the Heavens should again open and God's Word  go forth once more upon its mission of justice and mercy? The Gospel  of Christ is consistent and reasonable. It does not pre-judge men,  nor save nor damn them regardless of merit or demerit. Rewarding all  according to their works, it gives to every creature, living or dead, a  chance to accept or reject it, before final judgment. Is it not evident  that Joseph Smith and \"Mormonism\" were indeed a necessity at the dawn  of the Nineteenth Century, when even the Christian world had lost the  knowledge of the true God, proclaiming him either a nonentity incapable  of act or utterance, or a monster unmerciful and unjust?    Sons of Perdition.    God is not trying to damn the world, but to save it. All will be saved  except \"the sons of perdition\", those who have had every opportunity  to be saved--yes, saved and exalted. They who have known God, and have  \"tasted of the powers of the world to come\", and then have thrown it  all away, trampling upon the Truth as a thing of naught, denying the  Holy Ghost, and \"crucifying the Lord afresh\";--these cannot be saved,  for salvation is predicated upon repentance, and such have sinned  away the power to repent. This is what makes their case hopeless.  But comparatively few go that far. All the rest will be saved, and  eventually glorified.    Different Degrees of Glory.    There are different degrees of glory--a glory of the sun, a glory of  the moon, and a glory of the stars. So Paul taught (1 Cor. 15:40-42);  and Joseph Smith taught it even more plainly. (Doc. & Cov. 76.) They  who inherit celestial glory, of which the sun in the firmament is  typical, are they who receive the Gospel in this life, and are valiant  for it and endure to the end, giving to God the fulness of their  obedience. They who inherit terrestrial glory, which differs from the  celestial as the moon differs from the sun, are they who receive not  the Gospel here, but afterwards receive it; souls not valiant, and  who therefore \"win not the crown\". The inheritors of telestial glory,  typified by the stars, \"are they who are thrust down to hell\", where  they pay their debt to Justice, after which Mercy claims its own, and  they are ushered into a light and freedom greater than the finite mind  can comprehend.    Such is \"Mormonism's\" astounding declaration--the only religion on  earth that dares to say THE DAMNED CAN BE SAVED! Yes, anyone can be  saved who will repent, even in the depths of hell. But why go there to  repent? Why not make Peace with Heaven here?    A Nautical Illustration.    I was crossing the Atlantic on an ocean liner. I was a first cabin  passenger; and besides myself there were upwards of a hundred others  in that part of the vessel. The second cabin had about twice as many  passengers, and in the steerage were several hundred more. The first  cabin berths were not only the best furnished, but the most favorably  situated for comfort, convenience, and safety. Every courtesy was  shown to the passengers; the captain and other officers were their  associates; their food was of the choicest, and they had the full  freedom of the ship. They might go down into the second cabin, or lower  down, into the steerage, and return, without hindrance or question.  They had paid for these privileges and were therefore entitled to  them. But it was different in the second cabin. There the food was not  so good, the berths were less comfortable, and the privileges fewer.  Passengers might descend into the steerage, but were not permitted upon  the upper deck. In the steerage, conditions were even less favorable.  The food was still poorer, and the restrictions were more rigid. The  occupants of that section were not allowed even in the second cabin.  Having paid only for steerage accommodations, these were all that they  could consistently claim. Viewing the situation, I said to myself:  What a striking analogy to the final destiny of the human race, as set  forth in the revelations of God! All men rewarded according to their  works--saved according to their merits, in the eternal mansions of the  Father! And I resolved anew that I would be a first cabin passenger  over the ocean of life into the haven of Celestial glory.    Mormonism's Magnanimity.    Joseph the Seer, after gazing upon the glories of eternity, outlining  the ultimate destiny of the human race, had another vision in which he  \"beheld that all children who die before they arrive at the years of  accountability, are saved in the Celestial Kingdom\". He also saw his  father, his mother, and his brother Alvin in that Kingdom. His parents  had received the Gospel; but Alvin died before it came. He was a good  man, however, and had faith in what the Prophet told him. He simply had  not been baptized. Nevertheless, Joseph beheld him in celestial glory,  the highest glory of all, and it caused him to marvel. Then fell this  word from Heaven:    \"All who have died without a knowledge of this Gospel, who would have  received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the  Celestial Kingdom of God; also all that shall die henceforth without  a knowledge of it, who would have received it with all their hearts,  shall be heirs of that Kingdom, for I, the Lord, will judge all men  according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.\"  (Joseph Smith's Teachings, p. 19; Church History, Vol. 2, pp. 380-318).    Could justice, mercy, magnanimity, go further? And yet there are people  who imagine \"Mormonism\" to be something small, narrow and illiberal.  By the contrary, it is broad, generous and charitable, as all its  teachings testify.    The Source of Its Strength.    \"Mormonism's\" strength is not in the number of its adherents, who are  comparatively few; nor in the sagacity of its leading men, who are only  mortals. Rather does it reside in the fact that every worthy man and  woman connected with it is entitled to and receives a personal, direct  testimony of its truth. The Church of Christ is founded upon this  rock--the Rock of Revelation--against which the waves of sophistry,  the billows of bigotry, the breakers of persecution, beat and dash in  vain. All who fight the truth are fordoomed to defeat. The Gates of  Hell cannot prevail against it. \"Mormonism\" is strong because God is  its Author--the Engineer directing its course; and all the might of  Omnipotence is behind it, impelling it on to its destiny. It is the  Everlasting Gospel, the saving, glorifying power of God, the power by  which He carries on His mighty and marvelous work, bringing to pass the  immortality and eternal life of man.
