Amongst other totems were once the Bralgah, Native Companion, and  Dibbee, a sort of sandpiper, but their kins are quite extinct as far as  our blacks are concerned; the birds themselves are still plentiful. The  Bralgah birds have a Boorah ground at the back of our old  horse-paddock, a smooth, well-beaten circle, where they dance the  grotesque dances peculiar to them, which are really most amusing to  watch, somewhat like a set of kitchen lancers into which some dignified  dames have got by mistake, and a curious mixture is the dance of  dignity and romping.    The totem kins numerically strongest with us were the Dinewans,  Beewees, Bohrahs, and Gouyous. Further back in the country, they tell  me, the crow, the eaglehawk, and the bees were original totems, not  multiplex ones, as with us.    It may be as well for those interested in the marriage law puzzles to  state that Dinewans, Bohrahs, Douyous, and Doolungayers are always      Kumbo             Hippi    Bootha            Hippitha.      That Moodai, Gouyou, Beewee, Maira, Yubbah are always      Murree            Kubbee    Matha             Kubbootha.    Our blacks may and do eat their hereditary totems, if so desirous, with  no ill effects to themselves, either real or imaginary; their totem  names they take from their mothers. They may, in fact, in any way use  their totems, but never abuse them. A Beewee, for example, may kill, or  see another kill, and eat or use a Beewee, or one of its multiplex  totems, and show no sign of sorrow or anger, but should any one speak  evil of the Beewee, or of any of its multiplex totems, there will be a  quarrel.    There will likewise be a quarrel if any one dares to mimic a totem,  either by drawing one, except at Boorahs, or imitating it in any way.    There are members of the tribes, principally wizards, or men intended  to be such, who are given an individual totem called Yunbeai. This they  must never eat or they will die. Any injury to his yunbeai hurts the  man himself In danger he has the power to assume the shape of his  yunbeai, which of course is a great assistance to him, especially in  legendary lore; but, on the other hand, a yunbeai is almost a Heel of  Achilles to a wirreenun (see the chapter on Medicine and Magic).    Women are given a yunbeai too, sometimes. One girl had a yunbeai given  her as a child, and she was to be brought up as a witch, but she caught  rheumatic fever which left her with St. Vitus's dance. The yunbeai  during one of her bad attacks jumped out of her, and she lost her  chance of witchery. One old fellow told me once that when he was going  to a public-house he took a miniature form of his yunbeai, which was  the Kurrea--crocodile--out of himself and put it safety in a bottle of  water, in case by any chance he got drunk, and an enemy, knowing his  yunbeai, coaxed it away. I wanted to see that yunbeai in a bottle, but  never succeeded.    The differences between the hereditary totem or Dhe, inherited from the  mother, and the individual totem or yunbeai, acquired by chance, are  these: Food restrictions do not affect the totem, but marriage  restrictions do; the yunbeai has no marriage restrictions; a man having  an opossum for yunbeai may marry a woman having the same either as her  yunbeai or hereditary totem, other things being in order, but under no  circumstances must a yunbeai be eaten by its possessor.    The yunbeai is a sort of alter ego; a man's spirit is in his yunbeai,  and his yunbeai's spirit in him.    A Minggah, or spirit-haunted tree of an individual, usually chosen from  amongst a man's multiplex totems, is another source of danger to him,  as also a help.    As Mr. Canton says: 'What singular threads of superstition bind the  ends of the earth together! In an old German story a pair of lovers  about to part chose each a tree, and by the tree of the absent one was  the one left to know of his wellbeing or the reverse. In time his tree  died, and she, hearing no news of him, pined away, her tree withering  with her, and both dying at the same time.    Well, that is just what a wirreenun would believe about his Minggah.  These Minggah and Goomarh spirit trees and stones always make me think,  perhaps irrelevantly, of one of the restored sayings of the Lord, which  ends 'Raise the stone, and there thou shalt find Me; cleave the wood,  and I am there.'    Blacks were early scientists in some of their ideas, being before  Darwin with the evolution theory, only theirs was a kind of evolution  aided by Byamee. I dare say, though, the missing link is somewhere in  the legends. I rather think the Central Australians have the key to it.  One old man here was quite an Ibsen with his ghastly version of  heredity.    He said, when I asked him what harm it would do for, say, a Beewee  totem man to come from the Gulf country, where his tribe had never had  any communication with ours, and marry a girl here,--that all Beewees  were originally changed from the Beewee form into human shape. The  Beewee of the Gulf, originally, like the Beewee here, had the same  animal shape, and should two of this same blood mate the offspring  would throw back, as they say of horses, to the original strain, and  partake of iguana (Beewee) attributes either in nature or form.    From the statements just given, it will be seen that the Euahlayi are  in the Kamilaroi stage of social organisation. They reckon descent in  the female line: they have 'phratries' and four matrimonial classes,  with totems within the phratries. In their system of 'multiplex-totems'  or 'sub-totems' they resemble the Wotjobaluk tribe. [Howitt, NATIVE TRIBES  OF SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIA, pp. 121, 125, 453, 455.] The essence of the  'sub-totem' system is the division of all things into the categories  provided by the social system of the human society. The arrangement is a  very early attempt at a scientific system of classification.    Perhaps the most peculiar feature in the organisation of the Euahlayi  is the existence of Matrimonial Classes, which are named as in the  Kamilaroi tongue, while the phratry names are not those of the Kamilaroi,  and alone among phratry names in Australia which can be translated, are  not names of animals. The phratries have thus no presiding animals, and in  the phratries there are no totem kins of the phratriac names. The cause of  these peculiarities is matter of conjecture.    A peculiarity in the totemic system of the Euahlayi--the right of each  individual to kill and eat his own totem--has been mentioned, and may  be associated here with other taboos on food.    The wunnarl, or food taboo, was taken off a different kind of food for  boys at each Boorah, until at last they could eat what they pleased  except their yunbeai, or individual familiar: their Dhe, or family  totem, was never wunnarl or taboo to them.    A child may not perhaps know that it has had a yunbeai given to it, and  may eat of it in ignorance, when immediately they say that child  sickens.    Should a boy or a girl eat plains turkey or bustard eggs while they  were yet wunnarl, or taboo, he or she would lose his or her sight.  Should they eat the eggs or flesh of kangaroo or piggiebillah, their  skins would break out in sores and their limbs wither.    Even honey is wunnarl at times to all but the very old or very young.  Fish is wunnarl for about four years after his Boorah to a boy, and  about four months after she is wirreebeeun, or young woman, to a girl.    When the wunnarl was taken off a particular kind of meat, a wizard  poured some of the melted fat and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/382"],[0,"Edinburgh: Picturesque Notes (#8)"],[1,"him of Nature's unconcern: that  he can watch from day to day, as he trots officeward, how the Spring  green brightens in the wood or the field grows black under a moving  ploughshare.  I have been tempted, in this connexion, to deplore the  slender faculties of the human race, with its penny-whistle of a voice,  its dull cars, and its narrow range of sight.  If you could see as people  are to see in heaven, if you had eyes such as you can fancy for a  superior race, if you could take clear note of the objects of vision, not  only a few yards, but a few miles from where you stand:--think how  agreeably your sight would be entertained, how pleasantly your thoughts  would be diversified, as you walked the Edinburgh streets!  For you might  pause, in some business perplexity, in the midst of the city traffic, and  perhaps catch the eye of a shepherd as he sat down to breathe upon a  heathery shoulder of the Pentlands; or perhaps some urchin, clambering in  a country elm, would put aside the leaves and show you his flushed and  rustic visage; or a fisher racing seawards, with the tiller under his  elbow, and the sail sounding in the wind, would fling you a salutation  from between Anst'er and the May.    To be old is not the same thing as to be picturesque; nor because the Old  Town bears a strange physiognomy, does it at all follow that the New Town  shall look commonplace.  Indeed, apart from antique houses, it is curious  how much description would apply commonly to either.  The same sudden  accidents of ground, a similar dominating site above the plain, and the  same superposition of one rank of society over another, are to be  observed in both.  Thus, the broad and comely approach to Princes Street  from the east, lined with hotels and public offices, makes a leap over  the gorge of the Low Calton; if you cast a glance over the parapet, you  look direct into that sunless and disreputable confluent of Leith Street;  and the same tall houses open upon both thoroughfares.  This is only the  New Town passing overhead above its own cellars; walking, so to speak,  over its own children, as is the way of cities and the human race.  But  at the Dean Bridge, you may behold a spectacle of a more novel order.  The river runs at the bottom of a deep valley, among rocks and between  gardens; the crest of either bank is occupied by some of the most  commodious streets and crescents in the modern city; and a handsome  bridge unites the two summits.  Over this, every afternoon, private  carriages go spinning by, and ladies with card-cases pass to and fro  about the duties of society.  And yet down below, you may still see, with  its mills and foaming weir, the little rural village of Dean.  Modern  improvement has gone overhead on its high-level viaduct; and the extended  city has cleanly overleapt, and left unaltered, what was once the summer  retreat of its comfortable citizens.  Every town embraces hamlets in its  growth; Edinburgh herself has embraced a good few; but it is strange to  see one still surviving--and to see it some hundreds of feet below your  path.  Is it Torre del Greco that is built above buried Herculaneum?  Herculaneum was dead at least; but the sun still shines upon the roofs of  Dean; the smoke still rises thriftily from its chimneys; the dusty miller  comes to his door, looks at the gurgling water, hearkens to the turning  wheel and the birds about the shed, and perhaps whistles an air of his  own to enrich the symphony--for all the world as if Edinburgh were still  the old Edinburgh on the Castle Hill, and Dean were still the quietest of  hamlets buried a mile or so in the green country.                        [Picture: In the Village of Dean]    It is not so long ago since magisterial David Hume lent the authority of  his example to the exodus from the Old Town, and took up his new abode in  a street which is still (so oddly may a jest become perpetuated) known as  Saint David Street.  Nor is the town so large but a holiday schoolboy may  harry a bird's nest within half a mile of his own door.  There are places  that still smell of the plough in memory's nostrils.  Here, one had heard  a blackbird on a hawthorn; there, another was taken on summer evenings to  eat strawberries and cream; and you have seen a waving wheatfield on the  site of your present residence.  The memories of an Edinburgh boy are but  partly memories of the town.  I look back with delight on many an  escalade of garden walls; many a ramble among lilacs full of piping  birds; many an exploration in obscure quarters that were neither town nor  country; and I think that both for my companions and myself, there was a  special interest, a point of romance, and a sentiment as of foreign  travel, when we hit in our excursions on the butt-end of some former  hamlet, and found a few rustic cottages embedded among streets and  squares.  The tunnel to the Scotland Street Station, the sight of the  trains shooting out of its dark maw with the two guards upon the brake,  the thought of its length and the many ponderous edifices and open  thoroughfares above, were certainly things of paramount impressiveness to  a young mind.  It was a subterranean passage, although of a larger bore  than we were accustomed to in Ainsworth's novels; and these two words,  'subterreanean passage,' were in themselves an irresistible attraction,  and seemed to bring us nearer in spirit to the heroes we loved and the  black rascals we secretly aspired to imitate.  To scale the Castle Rock  from West Princes Street Gardens, and lay a triumphal hand against the  rampart itself, was to taste a high order of romantic pleasure.  And  there are other sights and exploits which crowd back upon my mind under a  very strong illumination of remembered pleasure.  But the effect of not  one of them all will compare with the discoverer's joy, and the sense of  old Time and his slow changes on the face of this earth, with which I  explored such corners as Cannonmills or Water Lane, or the nugget of  cottages at Broughton Market.  They were more rural than the open  country, and gave a greater impression of antiquity than the oldest  _land_ upon the High Street.  They too, like Fergusson's butterfly, had a  quaint air of having wandered far from their own place; they looked  abashed and homely, with their gables and their creeping plants, their  outside stairs and running mill-streams; there were corners that smelt  like the end of the country garden where I spent my Aprils; and the  people stood to gossip at their doors, as they might have done in  Colinton or Cramond.    In a great measure we may, and shall, eradicate this haunting flavour of  the country.  The last elm is dead in Elm Row; and the villas and the  workmen's quarters spread apace on all the borders of the city.  We can  cut down the trees; we can bury the grass under dead paving-stones; we  can drive brisk streets through all our sleepy quarters; and we may  forget the stories and the playgrounds of our boyhood.  But we have some  possessions that not even the infuriate zeal of builders can utterly  abolish and destroy.  Nothing can abolish the hills, unless it be a  cataclysm of nature which shall subvert Edinburgh Castle itself and lay  all her florid structures in the dust.  And as long as we have the hills  and the Firth, we have a famous heritage to leave our children.  Our  windows, at no expense to us, are most artfully stained to represent a  landscape.  And when the Spring comes round, and the hawthorns begin to  flower, and the meadows to smell of young grass, even in the thickest of  our streets, the country hilltops find out a young man's eyes, and set  his heart beating for travel and pure air.          CHAPTER VII. THE VILLA QUARTERS.      Mr. Ruskin's denunciation of the New Town of Edinburgh includes, as I  have heard it repeated, nearly all the stone and lime we have to show.  Many however find a grand air and something settled and imposing in the  better parts; and upon many, as I have said, the confusion of styles  induces an agreeable stimulation of the mind.  But upon the subject of  our recent villa architecture, I am frankly ready to mingle my tears with  Mr. Ruskin's, and it is a subject which makes one envious of his large  declamatory and controversial eloquence.    Day by day, one new villa, one new object of offence, is added to  another; all around Newington and Morningside, the dismallest structures  keep springing up like mushrooms; the pleasant hills are loaded with  them, each impudently squatted in its garden, each roofed and carrying  chimneys like a house.  And yet a glance of an eye discovers their true  character.  They are not houses; for they were not designed with a view  to human habitation, and the internal arrangements are, as they tell me,  fantastically unsuited to the needs of man.  They are not buildings; for  you can scarcely say a thing is built where every measurement is in  clamant disproportion with its neighbour.  They belong to no style of  art, only to a form of business much to be regretted.    Why should it be cheaper to erect a structure where the size of the  windows bears no rational relation to the size of the front?  Is there  any profit in a misplaced chimney-stalk?  Does a hard-working, greedy  builder gain more on a monstrosity than on a decent cottage of equal  plainness?  Frankly, we should say, No.  Bricks may be omitted, and green  timber employed, in the construction of even a very elegant design; and  there is no reason why a chimney should be made to vent, because it is so  situated as to look comely from without.  On the other hand, there is a  noble way of being ugly: a high-aspiring fiasco like the fall of Lucifer.  There are daring and gaudy buildings that manage to be offensive, without  being contemptible; and we know that 'fools rush in where angels fear to  tread.'  But to aim at making a common-place villa, and to make it"]]]
