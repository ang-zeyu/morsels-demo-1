Yet this  promotion to the mortal state is regarded by many as a degradation;  and we are prone to bewail the fallen condition of the race as an  unmitigated calamity. The Scriptures make plain the glorious truth  that man may rise far above the plane upon which he existed before his  birth in the flesh. We have stooped that we may conquer; we have been  permitted to descend only that we may attain greater heights.    The transgression of our parents in Eden was foreseen, and the Divine  plan provided a means of redemption. The Eternal Father, who is verily  the Father of our spirits, well understood the diverse natures and  varied capacities of His unembodied children; and it was plain to Him,  even from the beginning, that in the school of mortal life some would  succeed while others would fail; some would be faithful and others  false; some would choose the good, others the evil; some would seek  the way of life while others would follow the road to destruction. He  foresaw that His commandments would be disobeyed and His law violated;  and that men, shut out from His presence and left to themselves would  sink rather than rise, would retrograde rather than advance, and would  be lost to the heavens. It was plain to Him that death would enter the  world, and that the possession of bodies by His children would be of  brief individual duration.    A Redeemer was chosen, and that even before the foundation of the  world. He, the first-born among all the spirit children of God, was  to come to earth, clothed with the attributes of both Godhood and  manhood, to teach men the saving principles of the eternal Gospel  and so establish on earth the terms and conditions of salvation. In  consummation of His mission, Christ gave up His life as a voluntary and  vicarious sacrifice for the race. Through the Atonement wrought by Him  the power of death has been overcome; for while all men must die, their  resurrection is assured. The effect of Christ's Atonement upon the race  is twofold:    1. The eventual resurrection of all men, whether righteous or wicked.  This constitutes Redemption from the Fall, and, since the Fall came  through individual transgression, in all justice relief therefrom must  be made universal and unconditional.    2. The providing of a means whereby reparation may be made and  forgiveness be obtained for individual sin. This constitutes Salvation,  and is made available to all through obedience to the laws and  ordinances of the Gospel.    Between redemption from the power of death and salvation in the Kingdom  of Heaven there is a vital difference. Man alone cannot save himself;  Christ alone cannot save him. The plan of salvation is cooperative. The  Atonement effected by the Lord Jesus Christ has opened the way; it is  left to every man to enter therein and be saved or to turn aside and  forfeit salvation. God will force no man either into heaven or into  hell.    Jacob, a Nephite prophet, has given us a masterly summary of the  results of our Lord's Atonement, both as to the universal redemption  from death, and the conditions upon which individual salvation may be  obtained:    \"For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan  of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection,  and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall;  and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became  fallen, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord; Wherefore it  must needs be an infinite atonement; save it should be an infinite  atonement, this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore,  the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an  endless duration. . .. And it shall come to pass, that when all men  shall have passed from this first death unto life, insomuch as they  have become immortal, they must appear before the judgment-seat of the  Holy One of Israel; and then cometh the judgment, and then must they  be judged according to the holy judgment of God. . .. And he suffereth  this, that the resurrection might pass upon all men, that all might  stand before him at the great and judgment day. And he commandeth all  men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, having perfect  faith in the Holy One of Israel, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom  of God. And if they will not repent and believe in his name, and be  baptized in his name, and endure to the end, they must be damned; for  the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has spoken it.\" (Book of Mormon,  2 Nephi 9:6, 7, 15, 22-24).        -- 12 --    THE NEED OF A REDEEMER    Man Cannot Exalt Himself    THE Scriptures inform us that, prior to his transgression in Eden,  Adam held direct and personal communion with God; and that one of the  immediate consequences of his fall, which was brought about through  disobedience, was his forfeiture of that exalted association. He was  shut out from the presence of God, and though he heard the Divine Voice  he no longer was permitted to behold the Presence of the Lord. This  banishment was to the man spiritual death; and its infliction brought  into effect the predicted penalty, that in the day of his sin he would  surely die. See Gen. 2:17; Pearl of Great Price, p. 14.    Through partaking of food unsuited to their condition and against  which they had been specifically forewarned, the man and his wife  became subject to physical degeneracy; and, eventually, as Satan the  arch-tempter had foreseen, both the man and the woman had to suffer  bodily death. Their offspring were directly affected by the hereditary  enthralment, to which Abel fell a victim even during the life-time of  his parents.    Death came into the world through sin; the imperfections and frailties  incident to the mortal state are conducive to sin; and man is prone  in an inexcusable degree to readily yield thereto. So general is sin  operative in the world that the wise comment of the ancient preacher  stands unchallenged: \"There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth  good and sinneth not.\" (Eccles. 7:20). And the admonitory precept given  by John the Apostle has lost none of its inspired forcefulness with  time: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the  truth is not in us.\" (1 John 1:8).    This sinful and fallen condition of mankind and the universal  infliction of death are dominant elements of Satan's diabolical scheme  to subdue the embodied spirits, whom he, as the rebellious son of the  morning, had failed to draw to his standard in the conflict of primeval  hosts. See Rev. 12:7-9; Isa. 14:12; also D&C 29:36-38 and 76:25-27.  God provided a way by which His spirit-children would become embodied  as a means of advancement; Satan introduced degeneracy and death in an  attempt to thwart the Divine purpose.    Death may claim its victim in infancy or youth, in the period of  life's prime or when the snows of age have settled heavily upon the  venerable head; it may come through disease or accident, by violence,  or as what we call the result of natural causes; but come it must, as  Satan well knows; and in that knowledge lies his present though but  temporary triumph. But the ways of God, as they ever have been and ever  shall be, are infinitely more potent than the deepest designs of men  or devils; and the Satanic machinations to make death perpetual and  supreme were foreseen and provided against even before the first man  had been clothed in flesh. The Atonement wrought by Jesus Christ was  ordained to overcome death, and to provide a means of ransom from sin  and consequent deliverance from the dominion of Satan.    As the natural and inevitable penalty incident to Adam's fall came  upon the race through individual transgression, it would be manifestly  unjust and therefore impossible as part of the Divine plan to make all  men suffer the results thereof without provision for emancipation.  \"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;  and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: Therefore  as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation;  even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men  unto justification of life.\" (Rom. 5:12, 18). And further: \"For since  by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For  as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\" (1 Cor.  15:21, 22; see further Book of Mormon, Mosiah 3:11, 12).    Without assistance from some power superior to his own, fallen man  would remain eternally in his state of spiritual banishment from the  presence of God. He is tainted and defiled through sin; and though  he must pass the gates of death, that change from the embodied to  the disembodied state cannot consistently be regarded as a means of  ransom from the effect of transgression. We find in Nature an analogy  applicable to our present demonstration; though in its use the present  writer claims no credit for originality.    The lifeless mineral, belonging to the lowest of the \"three kingdoms,\"  may grow big through accretion of substance, and may attain relative  perfection of structure and form as in the crystal. But, though placed  in the most favorable environment, no mineral particle unassisted by  the power incident to life can become part of a living organism such  as the plant. The living plant, however, may reach down to the mineral  plane, and by absorption and assimilation make the mineral part of its  own organic tissue. So the plant, though of itself utterly powerless to  attain the yet higher plane of animal tissue, may be assimilated by the  animal and become part thereof. And so with respect to either plant or  animal substance becoming a constituent of human tissue.

Amen.    [Sidenote: Efforts of Sectarian Priests Against Restoration of Exiles.]    As soon as the Governor of Missouri intimated, or the news began to  circulate, that the \"Mormons\" (as the people called the members of  the Church), would be restored to their possessions in Jackson county  (if they desired to be), the priests of all denominations, as the men  behind the scene, with the mob, began to set their springs in motion,  and by their secret councils, and false publications and insinuations,  soured the public mind, and prevented the administration {4} of the  laws, so that anything like a return to their houses and lands, or  recovery of damages for losses sustained, seemed as distant as the day  of judgment. The powers of wickedness and darkness walked hand in hand  together, and the Saints mourned.    _January 16_.--I visited Brother Jenkins Salisbury, and spent the  night. O Lord! keep us and my family safe, until I return unto them; O  my God, have mercy on my brethren in Zion, for Christ's sake. Amen.    _January 22_.--The Presidency of the High Priesthood wrote from  Kirtland to the brethren in Christ Jesus, scattered from Zion--  scattered abroad from the land of their inheritance:        THE ELDERS OF THE CHURCH TO THEIR BRETHERN ABROAD. [2]        _Dear Brethren in Christ, and Companions in Tribulation_:        When we call to remembrance the ties with which we are bound to      those who embrace the everlasting covenant, and the fellowship and      love with which the hearts of the children of our Lord's kingdom      should be united, we cherish a belief that you will bear with us,      when we take this course to communicate to you some of the many      thoughts which occupy our minds, and press with continued weight      upon our hearts, as we reflect upon the vast importance and {5}      responsibility of your callings, in the sight of the Master of the      vineyard. And though our communications to you may be frequent,      yet we believe they will be received on your part with brotherly      feelings; and that from us your unworthy brethren, you will suffer      a word of exhortation to have place in your hearts, as you see the      great extent of the power and dominion of the prince of darkness,      and realize how vast the numbers are who are crowding the road to      death without ever giving heed to the cheering sound of the Gospel      of our Lord Jesus Christ.        Consider for a moment, brethren, the fulfillment of the words of      the prophet; for we behold that darkness covers the earth, and      gross darkness the minds of the inhabitants thereof--that crimes      of every description are increasing among men--vices of great      enormity are practiced--the rising generation growing up in the      fullness of pride and arrogance--the aged losing every sense of      conviction, and seemingly banishing every thought of a day of      retribution,--intemperance, immorality, extravagance, pride,      blindness of heart, idolatry, the loss of natural affection; the      love of this world, and indifference toward the things of eternity      increasing among those who profess a belief in the religion of      heaven, and infidelity spreading itself in consequence of the      same--men giving themselves up to commit acts of the foulest      kind, and deeds of the blackest dye, blaspheming, defrauding,      blasting the reputation of neighbors, stealing, robbing, murdering;      advocating error and opposing the truth, forsaking the covenant of      heaven, and denying the faith of Jesus--and in the midst of all      this, the day of the Lord fast approaching when none except those      who have won the wedding garment will be permitted to eat and drink      in the presence of the Bridegroom, the Prince of Peace!        Impressed with the truth of these facts what can be the feelings of      those who have been partakers of the heavenly gift and have tasted      the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come? Who      but those who can see the awful precipice upon which the world of      mankind stands in this generation, can labor in the vineyard of the      Lord without feeling a sense of the world's deplorable situation?      Who but those who have duly considered the condescension of the      Father of our spirits, in providing a sacrifice for His creatures,      a plan of redemption, a power of atonement, a scheme of salvation,      having as its great objects, the bringing of men back into the      presence of the King of heaven, crowning them in the celestial      glory and making them heirs with the Son to that inheritance which      is incorruptible, undefiled, and which fadeth not away--who but      such can realize the importance of a perfect walk before all men,      and a {6} diligence in calling upon all men to partake of these      blessings? How indescribably glorious are these things to mankind!      Of a truth they may be considered tidings of great joy to all      people; and tidings, too, that ought to fill the earth and cheer      the hearts of every one when sounded in his ears. The reflection      that everyone is to receive according to his own diligence and      perseverance while in the vineyard, ought to inspire everyone who      is called to be a minister of the glad tidings, to so improve his      talent that he may gain other talents, that when the Master sits      down to take an account of the conduct of His servants, it may be      said, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful      over a few things; I will now make thee ruler over many things;      enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.        Some may pretend to say that the world in this age is fast      increasing in righteousness; that the dark ages of superstition      and blindness have passed, when the faith of Christ was known and      held only by a few, when ecclesiastic power had an almost universal      control over Christendom, and the consciences of men were bound by      the strong chains of priestly power: but now, the gloomy cloud is      burst, and the Gospel is shining with all the resplendent glory of      an apostolic day; and that the kingdom of the Messiah is greatly      spreading, that the Gospel of our Lord is carried to divers nations      of the earth, the Scriptures translating into different tongues;      the ministers of truth crossing the vast deep to proclaim to men      in darkness a risen Savior, and to erect the standard of Emanuel      where light has never shone; and that the idol is destroyed, the      temple of images forsaken; and those who but a short time previous      followed the traditions of their fathers and sacrificed their own      flesh to appease the wrath of some imaginary god, are now raising      their voices in the worship of the Most High, and are lifting their      thoughts up to Him with the full expectation that one day they will      meet with a joyful reception in His everlasting kingdom!        But a moment's candid reflection upon the principles of these      systems, the manner in which they are conducted, the individuals      employed, the apparent object held out as an inducement to cause      them to act, we think, is sufficient for every candid man to draw      a conclusion in his own mind whether this is the order of heaven      or not. We deem it a just principle, and it is one the force of      which we believe ought to be duly considered by every individual,      that all men are created equal, and that all have the privilege of      thinking for themselves upon all matters relative to conscience.      Consequently, then, we are not disposed, had we the power, to      deprive any one of exercising that free independence of mind which      heaven has so graciously bestowed upon the human {7} family as one      of its choicest gifts; but we take the liberty (and this we have      a right to do) of looking at this order of things a few moments,      and contrasting it with the order of God as we find it in the      sacred Scriptures. In this review, however, we shall present the      points as we consider they were really designed by the great Giver      to be understood, and the happy result arising from a performance      of the requirements of heaven as revealed to every one who obeys      them; and the consequence attending a false construction, a      misrepresentation, or a forced meaning that was never designed in      the mind of the Lord when He condescended to speak from the heavens      to men for their salvation.        Previous to entering upon a subject of so great moment to the      human family there is a prominent item which suggests itself to      our minds which, here, in few words, we wish to discuss: All      regularly organized and well established governments have certain      laws by which, more or less, the innocent are protected and the      guilty punished. The fact admitted, that certain laws are good,      equitable and just, ought to be binding upon the individual who      admits this, and lead him to observe in the strictest manner an      obedience to those laws. These laws when violated, or broken by the      individual, must, in justice, convict his mind with a double force,      if possible, of the extent and magnitude of his crime; because      he could have no plea of ignorance to produce; and his act of      transgression was openly committed against light and knowledge. But      the individual who may be ignorant and imperceptibly transgresses      or violates laws, though the voice of the"]]]
