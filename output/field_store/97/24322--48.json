Therefore, he    says, since Socrates is mortal, it follows that the particular is the    universal--taking the \"is\" to be throughout expressive of identity.    But to say \"the particular is the universal\" is self-contradictory.    Again Hegel does not suspect a mistake but proceeds to synthesise    particular and universal in the individual, or concrete universal.    This is an example of how, for want of care at the start, vast and    imposing systems of philosophy are built upon stupid and trivial    confusions, which, but for the almost incredible fact that they are    unintentional, one would be tempted to characterise as puns.    There is quite another direction in which a large technical development  of logic has taken place: I mean the direction of what is called  logistic or mathematical logic. This kind of logic is mathematical in  two different senses: it is itself a branch of mathematics, and it is  the logic which is specially applicable to other more traditional  branches of mathematics. Historically, it began as _merely_ a branch of  mathematics: its special applicability to other branches is a more  recent development. In both respects, it is the fulfilment of a hope  which Leibniz cherished throughout his life, and pursued with all the  ardour of his amazing intellectual energy. Much of his work on this  subject has been published recently, since his discoveries have been  remade by others; but none was published by him, because his results  persisted in contradicting certain points in the traditional doctrine of  the syllogism. We now know that on these points the traditional doctrine  is wrong, but respect for Aristotle prevented Leibniz from realising  that this was possible.[13]      [13] _Cf._ Couturat, _La Logique de Leibniz_, pp. 361, 386.    The modern development of mathematical logic dates from Boole's _Laws of  Thought_ (1854). But in him and his successors, before Peano and Frege,  the only thing really achieved, apart from certain details, was the  invention of a mathematical symbolism for deducing consequences from the  premisses which the newer methods shared with those of Aristotle. This  subject has considerable interest as an independent branch of  mathematics, but it has very little to do with real logic. The first  serious advance in real logic since the time of the Greeks was made  independently by Peano and Frege--both mathematicians. They both arrived  at their logical results by an analysis of mathematics. Traditional  logic regarded the two propositions, \"Socrates is mortal\" and \"All men  are mortal,\" as being of the same form;[14] Peano and Frege showed that  they are utterly different in form. The philosophical importance of  logic may be illustrated by the fact that this confusion--which is still  committed by most writers--obscured not only the whole study of the  forms of judgment and inference, but also the relations of things to  their qualities, of concrete existence to abstract concepts, and of the  world of sense to the world of Platonic ideas. Peano and Frege, who  pointed out the error, did so for technical reasons, and applied their  logic mainly to technical developments; but the philosophical importance  of the advance which they made is impossible to exaggerate.      [14] It was often recognised that there was _some_ difference between    them, but it was not recognised that the difference is fundamental,    and of very great importance.    Mathematical logic, even in its most modern form, is not _directly_ of  philosophical importance except in its beginnings. After the beginnings,  it belongs rather to mathematics than to philosophy. Of its beginnings,  which are the only part of it that can properly be called  _philosophical_ logic, I shall speak shortly. But even the later  developments, though not directly philosophical, will be found of great  indirect use in philosophising. They enable us to deal easily with more  abstract conceptions than merely verbal reasoning can enumerate; they  suggest fruitful hypotheses which otherwise could hardly be thought of;  and they enable us to see quickly what is the smallest store of  materials with which a given logical or scientific edifice can be  constructed. Not only Frege's theory of number, which we shall deal with  in Lecture VII., but the whole theory of physical concepts which will be  outlined in our next two lectures, is inspired by mathematical logic,  and could never have been imagined without it.    In both these cases, and in many others, we shall appeal to a certain  principle called \"the principle of abstraction.\" This principle, which  might equally well be called \"the principle which dispenses with  abstraction,\" and is one which clears away incredible accumulations of  metaphysical lumber, was directly suggested by mathematical logic, and  could hardly have been proved or practically used without its help. The  principle will be explained in our fourth lecture, but its use may be  briefly indicated in advance. When a group of objects have that kind of  similarity which we are inclined to attribute to possession of a common  quality, the principle in question shows that membership of the group  will serve all the purposes of the supposed common quality, and that  therefore, unless some common quality is actually known, the group or  class of similar objects may be used to replace the common quality,  which need not be assumed to exist. In this and other ways, the indirect  uses of even the later parts of mathematical logic are very great; but  it is now time to turn our attention to its philosophical foundations.    In every proposition and in every inference there is, besides the  particular subject-matter concerned, a certain _form_, a way in which  the constituents of the proposition or inference are put together. If I  say, \"Socrates is mortal,\" \"Jones is angry,\" \"The sun is hot,\" there is  something in common in these three cases, something indicated by the  word \"is.\" What is in common is the _form_ of the proposition, not an  actual constituent. If I say a number of things about Socrates--that he  was an Athenian, that he married Xantippe, that he drank the  hemlock--there is a common constituent, namely Socrates, in all the  propositions I enunciate, but they have diverse forms. If, on the other  hand, I take any one of these propositions and replace its constituents,  one at a time, by other constituents, the form remains constant, but no  constituent remains. Take (say) the series of propositions, \"Socrates  drank the hemlock,\" \"Coleridge drank the hemlock,\" \"Coleridge drank  opium,\" \"Coleridge ate opium.\" The form remains unchanged throughout  this series, but all the constituents are altered. Thus form is not  another constituent, but is the way the constituents are put together.  It is forms, in this sense, that are the proper object of philosophical  logic.    It is obvious that the knowledge of logical forms is something quite  different from knowledge of existing things. The form of \"Socrates drank  the hemlock\" is not an existing thing like Socrates or the hemlock, nor  does it even have that close relation to existing things that drinking  has. It is something altogether more abstract and remote. We might  understand all the separate words of a sentence without understanding  the sentence: if a sentence is long and complicated, this is apt to  happen. In such a case we have knowledge of the constituents, but not of  the form. We may also have knowledge of the form without having  knowledge of the constituents. If I say, \"Rorarius drank the hemlock,\"  those among you who have never heard of Rorarius (supposing there are  any) will understand the form, without having knowledge of all the  constituents. In order to understand a sentence, it is necessary to have  knowledge both of the constituents and of the particular instance of the  form. It is in this way that a sentence conveys information, since it  tells us that certain known objects are related according to a certain  known form. Thus some kind of knowledge of logical forms, though with  most people it is not explicit, is involved in all understanding of  discourse. It is the business of philosophical logic to extract this  knowledge from its concrete integuments, and to render it explicit and  pure.    In all inference, form alone is essential: the particular subject-matter  is irrelevant except as securing the truth of the premisses. This is one  reason for the great importance of logical form. When I say, \"Socrates  was a man, all men are mortal, therefore Socrates was mortal,\" the  connection of premisses and conclusion does not in any way depend upon  its being Socrates and man and mortality that I am mentioning. The  general form of the inference may be expressed in some such words as,  \"If a thing has a certain property, and whatever has this property has a  certain other property, then the thing in question also has that other  property.\" Here no particular things or properties are mentioned: the  proposition is absolutely general. All inferences, when stated fully,  are instances of propositions having this kind of generality. If they  seem to depend upon the subject-matter otherwise than as regards the  truth of the premisses, that is because the premisses have not been all  explicitly stated. In logic, it is a waste of time to deal with  inferences concerning particular cases: we deal throughout with  completely general and purely formal implications, leaving it to other  sciences to discover when the hypotheses are verified and when they are  not.    But the forms of propositions giving rise to inferences are not the  simplest forms: they are always hypothetical, stating that if one  proposition is true, then so is another. Before considering inference,  therefore, logic must consider those simpler forms which inference  presupposes.

N lat) and extends in the east to about Point  Conception, California, and the Sanriku Coast of Honshu Island in the  west. Humpbacks range into shallow coastal waters more frequently than  do most other balaenopterids and regularly occur in sheltered inside  waters of Prince William Sound and the Alexander Archipelago of  southeastern Alaska.    The wintering grounds of humpbacks in the North Pacific are centered  in three areas: (1) the coast and adjacent islands of west-central  Mexico; (2) the main Hawaiian Islands; and (3) the Bonin, Ryukyu, and  Mariana Islands in the western North Pacific. Some humpbacks that  summer in southeastern Alaska are known to migrate to both the Mexican  and Hawaiian wintering grounds, although others are found in  southeastern Alaska during all months of the year.    Prior to the rise of modern whaling in the late 1800's, the world  population of humpback whales exceeded 100,000, mostly in the Southern  Hemisphere. The North Pacific population probably numbered roughly  15,000 at the turn of the century.    Whaling in southeastern Alaska began in 1907 with the establishment of  two land stations. The number of humpback whales at the start of this  earliest exploitation is unknown. Consistent catch records are  available only for 1912-1922, during which time 185 humpbacks were  taken, with a peak catch of 39 in 1916.    Since 1922, no whaling has been conducted in the territorial waters of  southeastern Alaska. However, the humpback whales of the inside waters  were exposed to additional exploitation as they migrated across the  high seas or through the coastal territorial waters of British  Columbia, Washington, California, and Baja California.    By 1966, when humpbacks were accorded complete legal protection by the  International Whaling Commission, the world population of the species  had been reduced to about 5,000. The North Pacific population now  numbers about 1,000, of which 600 or 700 winter in the Hawaiian  Islands, and 200 or 300 winter in Mexico. Only a few humpbacks have  been sighted on the western North Pacific wintering grounds in recent  years. Since 1966 no trends in abundance have been observed either for  the North Pacific population as a whole or on any of its wintering or  summering grounds, including southeastern Alaska.    Based upon aerial and vessel surveys, the population that spends the  summer in the inside waters of southeastern Alaska numbers at least  70. Photoidentification studies now underway tentatively reveal that  the population may exceed 100. Although it ranges throughout the area  from Sumner Strait northward, its main concentration areas are  Frederick Sound-Stephens Passage, where a minimum of 40 whales occurs,  and Glacier Bay, where 20-25 whales occur. Humpback whales congregate  in these areas to feed upon the summer blooms of euphausiids, herring,  and capelin. Some whales arrive in June and stay on through early  September, although as mentioned earlier, other animals appear to  remain through the winter months.    When humpback whales historically began occupying Glacier Bay is  unknown, but they have occurred there every summer over the past seven  years of investigation. Photoidentification techniques indicate that  certain individuals repeatedly return to feed there.    The availability of these and other feeding areas in southeastern  Alaska has not been constant over the years. Although Glacier Bay has  lately been a prominent feeding area, this was not always so since the  area was covered by an ice sheet during the 18th century; at that time  the humpback population was presumably at its maximum pre-exploitation  level. There is some indication that a seasonal feeding area in Lynn  Canal was avoided by humpbacks coincident with the onset of a herring  fishery in 1972. With the cessation of that fishery, humpbacks  reoccupied the area in 1979. The possibility cannot be discarded that  these events are related.      =Present Glacier Bay Situation=    The NPS records indicate that during 1976 and 1977, 20-24 individual  humpback whales moved into Glacier Bay during June and remained there  into August. In 1978 this pattern of use changed when most of the  animals departed by mid-July. In 1979 this use was modified further  with fewer whales entering the Bay and very few of those remaining in  the Bay. Observations prior to 1976 are more general in nature, rather  than numerical counts of record.    Human use of the Bay is reflected in NPS records, to wit:               Visitor      Large    Private  Fishing   Year      Days         Ships    Boats    Vessels   ----      -------      -----    -------  -------   1965        1,800   1969       16,000               115   1970       30,000               165   1975       72,000      113      353      824   1976       85,000      123      318      656   1977      120,000      142      534      523   1978      109,000      123      699      458      Most visitor use is via water access, with cruise ship and  recreational craft visitation levels increasing rapidly in recent  years.    The recent NPS study indicates that increasing vessel traffic in  Glacier Bay may be implicated in the apparent departure of whales from  Glacier Bay in 1978 and 1979. Data on the number of observed  whale-vessel interactions in Glacier Bay enables calculation of the  following \"interaction\" index (data for 1979 not available):             Whale-vessel     Hours         Index   Year    Interactions     Observed      (interactions/hour)   -----   ------------     --------      -------------------   1976     98              261.1          0.38   1977    201              407.1          0.49   1978    268              397.5          0.67      Thus the occurrence of whale-vessel interactions increased 29 percent  and 76 percent respectively in 1977 and 1978 over the 1976 base level.  Despite mitigative regulations in 1979, observers noted that  whale-vessel interactions continued at substantial frequencies.    The NPS data indicate that behavior of the humpback whales in Glacier  Bay changed significantly in 1978. Comparison of the frequency  distributions of behavioral responses indicates that, whereas  distributions were the same in 1976 and 1977, both years were  statistically different from 1978. In 1978, more avoidance behavior  occurred than in previous years, suggesting that the whales reacted to  the increased level of vessel traffic in 1978. However, the causal  mechanism for these reactions (whether it be increased noise or visual  stimuli) remains unknown.    All classes of vessels were not implicated equally in the increased  level of interactions which occurred in 1978. Cruise ship visitations  actually decreased 14 percent in 1978 from the 1977 high, while  charter/pleasure craft visitations increased 120 percent between 1976  and 1978. Commercial fishing vessel traffic decreased 30 percent  between 1976 and 1978. Charter/pleasure craft were often observed to  change direction and travel toward whales for a closer look. Cruise  ships and commercial fishing vessels, on the other hand, neither  paused for nor actively followed whales. Thus the most likely source  for increased interaction would appear to be the increased visitations  by charter/pleasure craft in 1978.    This conclusion seems to agree with the perceptions of scientists  examining other similar situations. The workshop on problems related  to Hawaiian humpback whales, sponsored by the Marine Mammal Commission  in 1977, concluded that vessel traffic not oriented toward whales did  not ordinarily seem to disturb them. Indeed, it was concluded that  whales seem readily to habituate to constant or familiar noises such  as those produced by ships of passage. A recent review on the possible  effects of noises emanating from offshore oil and gas development  concluded that, unlike the abrupt response to sudden disturbances,  most whales become habituated to low-level background noises such as  would be associated with ship traffic (Geraci, J. R., and D. J. St.  Aubin, \"Possible Effects of Offshore Oil and Gas Development on Marine  Mammals,\" prepared for the Marine Mammal Commission, August 1979.)  Moreover, it was noted that such behavior forms the underlying basis  for the success of whale watching cruises. Thus the erratic actions of  charter/pleasure craft rather than the more constant action of cruise  ships may be the major factor in possible harassment by vessels within  Glacier Bay.    Cruise ships also may be implicated as potential sources of  disturbance due to the physical setting within Glacier Bay. A direct  analogy may be seen in the lagoons of Baja California where gray  whales calve. Heavy barge and freighter traffic associated with the  salt industry, as well as a dredge operating continuously in the  lagoon's mouth, apparently drove gray whales out of Laguna Guerrero  Negro between 1957 and 1967. The whales reinvaded in substantial  numbers when vessel traffic was eliminated. The continued high use of  Laguna Ojo de Liebre by gray whales suggests that the movement of salt  barges, beginning there in 1967, may not have been such a nuisance.  However, since Laguna Ojo de Liebre is a much larger area than Laguna  Guerrero Negro and has a much wider entrance, the whales there may  simply have been able to move and coexist next to the barges. Such  luxury of space may not be available to the humpback whales of Glacier  Bay and, due to geological configurations of its basin, vessel noise  may be accentuated there. These factors may account for the unexpected  reaction of humpbacks to cruise ships in Glacier Bay.    The apparent departure of humpback whales from Glacier Bay in 1978 and  1979 may also be "]]]
