He succeeded by this movement in bending in the British line at the  right flank of the Ulster division, north of the canal, which he crossed  hereabout, and by advancing his field artillery was able to bombard the  line to which the main body of the British troops had been withdrawn.  Down from Maissemy and Holnon Wood to Savy and Roupy he pressed forward  against this line.    The enemy was so densely massed that there was a division on about a  kilometer of front. None of them spread out on more than two kilometers  for a division, with a battalion for every 500 yards.    German storm troops were able to force their way to Vendeuil,  Lyfontaine, and Benay, south of Essigny, and to strike against Jussy and  Tergnier, on the St. Quentin Canal, on the evening of the first day.    They brought up two more divisions, and that night, owing to the  pressure of their attacks, it was decided that the British withdraw to a  prepared line further west, which was the best defense. This was done  during the darkness, the retirement being covered by gallant rearguards.    This morning the Germans followed up our withdrawal by clearing up all  the ground in the bend formed by the acute angle of the St. Quentin  Canal, which has its apex at Ugny, six kilometers east of Ham, and it  was reported that their patrols had entered the town of Ham itself.      CROSSING THE SOMME    _Monday, March 25._--The enemy fought fiercely yesterday to gain a  crossing over the Somme south of Peronne. He flung across a pontoon  bridge and rafts, and his men tried to cross, but the British field  artillery, firing at short range, smashed up many of these bridges and  killed his engineers and infantry. Gallant counterattacks by some of the  British flung him back across the river at several points, but elsewhere  he held his crossing long enough to put over some of his forces.    All the fighting in this part of the country since March 21 has been a  continuous battle, in which the British divisions holding the front line  below Gouzeaucourt to Maissemy have shown magnificent powers of  endurance, as indeed have all the others engaged, and have only yielded  ground under pressure of overwhelming numbers and great gunfire.    There was a bloody struggle in some old chalk quarries, where many  German dead now lie, and after the enemy had come some way forward ten  British tanks drove into him and shattered some of his battalions with  their machine-gun fire, dispersing groups of his advancing units. The  tanks manoeuvred about, firing continually on each flank and causing  terror among the enemy's foremost assault troops. The British fought a  number of rearguard actions and made many counterattacks in the  neighborhood of Roisel, and fell back to the line of the Somme only when  new masses of Germans passed through those battalions which they had met  and beaten.      SLAUGHTER OF GERMANS    The British gunners were firing hour after hour at large bodies of  Germans moving so close to them that the guns were laid directly on to  their targets, and caused deadly losses in these ranks of field-gray men  who never ceased to come forward in a living tide at whatever cost of  life and bore down on the defensive lines. Under this ceaseless tide  some of the British guns had to be abandoned, but many of them were  withdrawn to the other side of the Somme, and the gunners were wonderful  in the skill and courage with which they made this passage, took up new  positions, and went into action again like exhibition batteries at Earls  Court.    By Saturday morning the German troops were exhausted and spent, and in  some parts of the line made no further effort for a time, but halted to  gain some sleep and await fresh rations. On Saturday and Sunday the  British, who had had no rest from fighting, were reinforced and given  some relief, though many of them were again engaged, and, weary as they  were, put up gallant fights against the enemy, who also had been  reinforced by great numbers and came on again in an unending onslaught.      FIGHTING AGAINST ODDS    _Tuesday, March 26._--Since yesterday morning the enemy has continued  his violent thrusts against the British line westward from Bapaume and  Peronne, and his massed troops, mostly Brandenburgers and picked troops,  are now advancing in the direction of Roye and Nesle, where French  troops are heavily engaged.    At the same time he is passing on over the old Somme battlefields down  from Delville Wood, High Wood, and Maurepas toward the old lines the  British held before the beginning of the Somme battles in 1916.    The enemy has paused since he began the great offensive, on Thursday  last, only to bring up new divisions and pass them through and beyond  those divisions exhausted by attack or shattered under the British fire  while they reform and rest and then come on again, relieved once more by  reserves and continually crowding over the captured ground. By this  means, and owing to the enormous forces at the disposal of the German  command, they are able to pursue any advantage gained with fresh troops  against the hard-pressed British, who have been fighting without respite  since the beginning of the battle, six days ago, except where on the  right some of them have now been replaced in the front line by French  battalions.    In spite of the gravity of these hours and the progress made by the  enemy, there never has been a more glorious spirit shown by British  troops throughout history, and when one day all the details of this  battle may be written it will be an epic of heroism more wonderful than  the world now realizes, for the British troops and their officers have  withstood an onslaught of enormous forces which have never been less  than two to one, and in most parts of the line have been four to one and  six to one and eight to one, nine divisions against three around  Croisilles, eight divisions against two from the Cambrai sector  westward, and in many places one division against one battalion.      WEARIED BY ENDLESS BATTLE    Our men have been fighting for six days and nights like this, after the  first storm of shells and gas, until their beards have grown long and  their faces haggard and worn for lack of sleep, and their clothes have  become torn on wire and covered with dust of mud and chalk. I saw a  small party of them today so weary with this endless battle they could  hardly walk, and they were holding hands like tired children and leaning  against each other like drunken men, but for the most part they hold  their heads up gamely, because so far luck has been against them.    The whole movement of the army under the necessity of withdrawal from  fixed positions is as orderly as though on manoeuvres in England. I can  say honestly I have seen no officer show sign of being flurried.    It is all an amazing drama, because this open warfare is a new thing to  the army, and the menace of the enemy is strong and serious, and  retirement under the terrific pressure of the human avalanche now hurled  against the defenders is by no means pleasant. But in the inevitable  turmoil of this situation, in roads crowded with traffic of men and  guns, in villages seething with troops rushed up toward the battle line,  on the field of battle itself, the British Army retains its  self-control, its will power, and its supreme, inspired courage.      THE ATTACK AT ALBERT    _Wednesday, March 27._--The enemy has not made further advances on a big  scale between the Arras-Bapaume road on the left of the battlefront and  the village of Bray, on the Somme, but has paused in his massed attacks  in order to reorganize his line and bring up artillery.    There are heavy concentrations of German storm troops behind Maurepas,  Ginchy, and Beugnatre, and the roads around Bapaume have been crowded  with men and guns and transport passing down through Le Sars, with  German cavalry along the Bapaume-Gudecourt road and a steady drift  downward to the town of Albert.    That poor, stricken city of the golden Virgin, head downward, with her  babe in her outstretched arms, which I described so often in accounts of  the battles of the Somme in 1916, when that falling statue was lit up by  shellfire, was yesterday in the centre of the fighting north of the  Somme. [The golden Virgin and tower were destroyed later.] The night  before their assault yesterday they bombed it heavily from the air,  using the brilliant moonlight, which lay white over all the battlefields  and these roofs, to fly low and pick their targets wherever they saw  men moving or horses tethered.    In several cases it was not men they hit, but women and children who,  when the war seemed to have passed from this place a year ago, crept  back to their homes and built little wooden booths in which they sold  papers and picture postcards to the troops. Now suddenly the war has  flamed over them again and they were caught, before they could escape,  by thunderbolts out of the shining moonlight, terribly clear and  revealing dead horses about the ruined streets.      TRYING TO TAKE ARRAS    _Friday, March 29._--The enemy's pressure has for the time being relaxed  a little across the Somme, east of Corbie, and whatever effort he has  made during the last day and night has been repulsed with the most heavy  losses.    Yesterday the most exciting situation and the fiercest struggle was on  the left of the British battleline, from Gavrelle southward to below the  Scarpe. It was a deliberate, resolute effort by the enemy to capture  Arras. Three divisions of special storm troops, the 184th, 12th, and  27th Reserve, had been brought up for this purpose, though one of them  had been engaged before and roughly handled. They were ordered to take  Arras yesterday at all costs, and before their advance very heavy  bombardment was flung over the British lines from about 5 o'clock in the  morning for several hours.    Their main thrust was toward"]]]
