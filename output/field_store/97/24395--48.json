Eastlake, in vol. LXVI. of  the _Quarterly Review_, suggested the present work. Had that biography  been accessible to me at an earlier period, it might have assisted my  labours, and perhaps modified some of my views; but I had no  opportunity of consulting it until my own pages were nearly ready for  press. It is the fruit of successful German industry, sweetened by  candid and intelligent criticism, and its remaining still untranslated  into any language is among the remarkable anomalies of literary  history. I may be allowed here to mention that the accuracy and  success with which Lord Lindsay and Mrs. Jameson have cultivated the  field of Christian and legendary art, enable me to dispense with much  regarding a subject which would otherwise have been more prominent in  these volumes.]    The majority of proper names being Italian, are written in that  language, excepting such as, like those of places, and titles of popes  and sovereigns, have long been familiar to English ears in a different  orthography. In such matters uniformity of practice is the main object  to be attended to, and having to choose between names as they were  actually used and their English synonyms, we have preferred Giacomo  Piccinino, Giulio Romano, and Lorenzo de' Medici, to James the Little  Fellow, Julius the Roman, and Lawrence of the Medici.[8] There will  often be mentioned districts and divisions of Italy which are defined  by no exact political or geographical limits; it may therefore be well  here to explain in what sense these somewhat convertible terms are  employed. CENTRAL ITALY may be considered to contain the papal  territory and the three Tuscan duchies; UPPER and LOWER ITALY include  all the Peninsula, respectively to the north and the south of these  states. Again, LOMBARDY is used as a generic term for the whole basin  of the PO, the POLESINE being that portion of its delta, north of the  river, which belonged to the Dukes of Ferrara. ROMAGNA stretches from  the Po to the Metauro, from the Apennines to the Adriatic; LA MARCA,  or the March of Ancona, continues the same sea-board to the Tronto:  these two districts were long the cradle of Italian prowess, the  allotment-land of petty princes; both were partially comprehended  within the more ancient landmarks of UMBRIA, a mountain province lying  east of the Tiber. The lower basin of this classic stream contained  SABINA on the east, and the PATRIMONY of St. Peter on the west; the  COMARCA lying south of the Teverone stream, and the whole wide plain  around Rome being called the CAMPAGNA. TUSCANY, including the Sienese,  ran northwards from the Patrimony, beginning below Orbetello; and  Naples is familiarly called by Italians THE KINGDOM, having, until a  recent date, been the only royal state in their fatherland.    [Footnote 8: The case is stated by ROSCOE in his Preface to _Leo X._,  and we approve of his decision, notwithstanding the objections taken  to it in vol. VII., p. 356, of the _Edinburgh Review_.]    Our chronology also requires the use of certain conventional terms,  which ought to be defined. Assuming the close of the fifteenth century  as the zenith of Italy's glory in letters and arts, in politics and  arms, the only word specifically indicating that period is  _cinque-cento_; but seeing that its lustre was attained under military  and civil institutions, and was rendered permanent by studies and  artistic creations, derived from the middle ages and breathing their  spirit, the phrase _mediaeval_ is extended to include that period.           *       *       *       *       *    Few things are more baffling to students of history than the true  worth of money in different states and ages, and its relative value in  reference to our own standards. It is impossible to over-estimate the  convenience which tables, showing the fluctuations of currency and  prices among different nations, would afford; but the difficulties of  completing them may perhaps be insuperable. In order to supply this  desideratum, however imperfectly, a few observations are here  submitted.    In considering the value of money at different periods, a variety of  circumstances must be kept in view. There are, however, four elements  to be embraced by all calculations for such a purpose: (1) the  comparative weight of the coinage; (2) the respective amounts of alloy  introduced into the standard of precious metals; (3) the effect  produced on gold and silver value by the discovery of America; (4) the  fluctuations in prices of commodities. The last of these elements  includes and depends upon the others, so that a tariff of prices at  various times might be practically sufficient for the object  contemplated. The impediments, however, to obtaining such a tariff are  apparently insurmountable. Statistical facts, incidentally mentioned  by historians, or gleaned from original documents, must be received  with large allowance. Articles of costly luxury in one age became  abundant in another, and are at all times affected by local or  temporary causes. Quality was also variable; horses, oxen, sheep, and  poultry, reared or fed in rude times or uncultivated districts, cannot  fairly be compared with those perfected by care and expense; the same  may be said of wines, fruits, clothing; even land is saleable  according to its condition, fertility, or situation. The test usually  resorted to in such inquiries is corn; but weights and measures,  seldom uniform, are with difficulty ascertained at remote periods,  while exceptional prices are more frequently noted than average ones,  by observers prone to record striking events rather than every-day  facts. There are, however, some apparently admitted data not  altogether unavailable for our immediate purpose.    During the period embraced by our memoirs of Urbino, the standard of  value prevalent in most parts of Italy was the golden florin or ducat.  Of these probably equivalent terms, the former was generally employed  in Central Italy, the latter in Lombardy. According to Villani, the  florin of Florence, in 1340, weighed 72 grains of pure gold, 24 carats  fine. Sismondi, in referring to a period about a century later,  estimates its weight at 1/8 of an ounce, or 60 grains. Orsini reckons  it, in 1533, at 70 grains, 22 carats fine. On the whole, it appears,  from Cibrario and other authorities, that this coin, and its successor  the zecchino, have maintained an almost uniform weight down to the  present time. Assuming that gold in Italy had then the same  _coinage-value_ as in England, it appears from calculations, founded  upon Fleetwood's data, that the florin was, at these various periods,  equivalent in contemporary English coin to 3_s._ 6_d._, 4_s._ 8_d._,  and 5_s._ 10_d._ Again, the ducat of Venice is estimated by Daru at 4  franks in 1465, at 4-1/3 in 1490, and by Sanuto at 4_s._ English in  1500. Riposati, in a careful analysis of the coinage of Gubbio, proves  that the conventional Urbino florin of 1450 should have contained  634-34/59 grains of silver, besides alloy, which would at that time  have yielded 3_s._ 9_d._ English, or at our present pure silver value  (5_s._ 6_d._ to the ounce) 7_s._ 3-1/4_d._    It would follow, from these several opinions, that the florin or ducat  of Italy, in the fifteenth century, was equal to from 3_s._ 6_d._ to  4_s._ 6_d._ in _contemporary_ English circulation, which disposes of  two elements for our calculation. The remaining two must have been  inadequately kept in view by Cibrario, Ricotta, and Audin, who  respectively value the florin of 1400 as _now_ worth 16-2/3 francs,  that of 1490 at 14 francs, and that of 1500 at 12 francs; while in the  _Library of Entertaining Knowledge_ it is set down at 10_s._ English  in 1480. But if we assume the analogy of English prices as collected  by Fleetwood, the result will be very different. From these it appears  that an average cost of wheat and oats per quarter, in the fifteenth  century, was about 5_s._ 2_d._ and 2_s._ 6_d._, while the wages of  labourers and artisans were respectively 3-1/2_d._ and 4-1/2_d._ a  day. Accordingly, if corn be taken as the test, money was then _ten  times_ beyond its modern value; while, if we include labour and  luxuries, the actual depreciation must appear much greater. We are  greatly encouraged to find such an inference not very different from  that adopted by three recent and important authorities. Prescott  values the Spanish ducat of 1490 at 39_s._ 4_d._, and Macaulay states  that of Florence in 1340 at 40_s._ sterling, while Sismondi calculates  it at about 48 francs. On the whole, then, we venture to assume that  the Italian ducat or florin of the fifteenth century was nearly equal  to the present Spanish dollar, and that it would have purchased about  twelve times the amount of necessaries and luxuries which that coin  now represents in England--a discrepancy of course lessened in the  next and each succeeding age, especially as the precious metals  continued to flow in from the new hemisphere. This estimate is,  however, offered with great deference, and only as a general  approximation to the truth, by no means applicable to numerous  exceptional cases.[9]    [Footnote 9: By an elaborate process, founded upon very complex facts,  Cibrario concludes that, with reference to the value of wheat in  Piedmont, the florin is now worth only about double what it was in the  fourteenth century; but this does not seem a fair test to the relative  power of money even in Italy; and in a work intended for English  readers, it appears necessary to bring out an estimate applicable to  present prices in this country, not in Southern Europe, where money  still goes much"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42622"],[0,"The Book of Christmas (#8)"],[1,"the  materials from which a revival of the old pageantry must be derived, if  men should ever again find time to be as merry as their fathers were.    The numberless _local_ customs of which the still remaining tradition is  almost the sole record, and which added each its small contingent to the  aggregate of commemoration, would certainly render it a somewhat  difficult matter to restore the festival in its integrity; and, to be  very candid with our readers, we believe we may as well confess, at the  onset, what will be very apparent to them before we have done, that many  of the Christmas observances (whether general or local) are to be  recommended to their notice rather as curious pictures of ancient  manners than as being at all worthy of imitation by us who \"are wiser in  our generation.\" Sooth to say, we dare not let our zeal for our subject  lead us into an unqualified approbation of all the doings which it will  be our business to record in these pages, though they seem to have made  all ranks of people very happy in other days;--and that is no mean test  of the value of any institution. Really earnest as we are in the wish  that the _sentiment_ of the season could be restored in its amplitude,  we fear that many of the fooleries by which it exhibited itself could  not be gravely proposed as worthy amusements for a nation of  philosophers.    Still these very absurdities furnish the strongest evidences of the  right good-will with which men--ay, grave and learned men--surrendered  themselves to the merry spirit of the time, of that entire abandonment  which forgot to make a reservation of their outward dignities and gave  them courage to \"play the fool.\" Our readers need scarcely be told that  it must be a man of a very strong mind, or a man who could not help it,  who should dare to make a jack-pudding of himself in these days, when  all his fellows are walking about the world with telescopes in their  hands and quadrants in their pockets. No doubt it would have a somewhat  ridiculous effect to-day to see the members of the bar dancing a  galliard or a coranto, in full costume, before the Benchers,  notwithstanding that certain ancient forms are still retained in their  halls which have all the absurdity of the exploded ones without any of  their fun; and unquestionably we should think it rather strange to see a  respectable gentleman capering through the streets on a pasteboard  hobby-horse,--in lieu of the figurative hobby-horses on which most men  still exhibit,--although even that, we think, would offer an object less  ungracious than a child with an anxious brow and \"spectacles on nose.\"  The great wisdom of the world is, we presume, one of the natural  consequences of its advancing age; and though we are quite conscious  that some of its former pranks would be very unbecoming, now that it is  getting into years, and \"knows so much as it does,\" yet we are by no  means sure that we should not have been well content to have our lot  cast in the days when it was somewhat younger. They must have been very  pleasant times! Certain it is that the laugh of the humbler classes, and  of the younger classes, would be all the heartier, that it was echoed by  the powerful and the aged; the mirth of the ignorant more free and  genial, that the learned thought no scorn of it. For all that appears,  too, the dignities of those days suffered no detriment by their  surrender to the spirit of the times, but seem to have resumed all their  functions and privileges, when it had exhausted itself, with unimpaired  effect. Philosophers had due reverence, without erecting themselves  always on stilts for the purpose of attracting it; and names have come  down to us which are esteemed the names of grave and learned and wise  men,--even in this grave and learned and wise age,--who, nevertheless,  appear in their own to have conducted themselves at times very like  children.    From the royal Household-Books which exist, and from the Household-Books  of noble families (some of which have been printed for better  preservation), as also from the other sources to which we have alluded,  Mr. Sandys, in the very valuable introduction to his collection of  Christmas carols, already mentioned, has brought together a body of  valuable information,--both as to the stately ceremonies and popular  observances by which the season continued to be illustrated, from an  early period up to the time of its decline, amid the austerities of the  civil war. To this careful compilation we shall be occasionally indebted  for some curious particulars which had escaped ourselves, amid the  multiplied and unconnected sources from which our notes for this volume  had to be made. To those who would go deeper into the antiquarian part  of the subject than suits the purpose of a popular volume, we can  recommend that work, as containing the most copious and elaborate  synopsis of the existing information connected therewith which we have  found in the course of our own researches. It would be impossible,  however, in a paper of that length--or, indeed, in a volume of any  moderate size--to give an account of all the numerous superstitions and  observances of which traces are found, in an extended inquiry, to  exist,--throwing light upon each other and contributing to the complete  history of the festival. We have therefore gleaned from all quarters  those which appear to be the most picturesque and whose relation is the  most obvious, with a view, as much as possible, of generalizing the  subject and presenting its parts in relation to an intelligible whole.    As we shall have occasion, in our second part, to speak of those  _peculiar_ feelings and customs by which each of the several days of the  Christmas festival is specially illustrated, we shall not at present  pause to go into any of the details of the subject, although continually  tempted to do so by their connection with the observations which we are  called upon to make. The purpose of the present chapter is rather to  insist generally, and by some of its more striking features, upon the  high and lengthened festivity with which this portion of the year was so  long and so universally welcomed, and to seek some explanation of the  causes to which the diminution of that spirit, and the almost total  neglect of its ancient forms, are to be ascribed.    As early as the twelfth century we have accounts of the spectacles and  pageants by which Christmas was welcomed at the court of the then  monarch Henry II.; and from this period the wardrobe rolls and other  Household-Books of the English kings furnish continual evidences of the  costly preparations made for the festival. Many extracts from these  books have been made by Mr. Sandys and others, from which it appears  that the mirth of the celebration, and the lavish profusion expended  upon it, were on the increase from year to year, excepting during that  distracted period of England's history when these, like all other  gracious arrangements and social relations, were disturbed by the unholy  contests between the houses of the rival roses. There is, however, a  beautiful example of the sacred influence of this high festival  mentioned by Turner in his History of England, showing that its hallowed  presence had power, even in those warlike days, to silence even the  voice of war,--of all war save that most impious of (what are almost  always impious) wars, civil war. During the siege of Orleans, in 1428,  he says: \"The solemnities and festivities of Christmas gave a short  interval of repose. The English lords requested of the French commanders  that they might have a night of minstrelsy, with trumpets and clarions.  This was granted; and the horrors of war were suspended by melodies,  that were felt to be delightful.\"    In the peaceful reign of Henry VII., the nation, on emerging from that  long and unnatural struggle, appears to have occupied itself, as did the  wise monarch, in restoring as far as was possible, and by all means, its  disrupted ties, and rebaptizing its apostate feelings; and during this  period the festival of Christmas was restored with revived splendor and  observed with renewed zeal. The Household-Book of that sovereign,  preserved in the chapter-house at Westminster, contains numerous items  for disbursements connected with the Christmas diversions, in proof of  this fact.    The reign of Henry VIII. was a reign of jousts and pageants till it  became a reign of blood; and accordingly the Christmas pageantries  prepared for the entertainment of that execrable monarch were  distinguished by increased pomp and furnished at a more profuse  expenditure. The festivities of Eltham and Greenwich figure in the pages  of the old chroniclers; and the account books at the chapter-house  abound in payments made in this reign, for purposes connected with the  revels of the season.    We shall by and by have occasion to present our readers with some  curious particulars, illustrative of the cost and pains bestowed upon  this court celebration during the short reign of the young monarch  Edward VI.    Not all the gloom and terror of the sanguinary Mary's reign were able  entirely to extinguish the spirit of Christmas rejoicing throughout the  land, though the court itself was too much occupied with its auto-da-fe  spectacles to have much time for pageants of less interest.    Our readers, we think, need scarcely be told that the successor of this  stern and miserable queen (and, thank God! the last of that bad family)  was sure to seize upon the old pageantries, as she did upon every other  vehicle which could in any way be made to minister to her intolerable  vanity, or by which a public exhibition might be made, before the slaves  whom she governed, of her own vulgar and brutal mind. Under all the  forms of ancient festival observance, some offering was presented to  this insatiable and disgusting appetite,--and that, too,"]]]
