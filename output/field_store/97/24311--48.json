Throughout the  volume I have, so far as possible, referred to works that can be  consulted in Calcutta in the libraries of the Indian Museum, the  Geological Survey of India, or the Asiatic Society of Bengal. The names  of works that are not to be found in India are marked with a *. The  rarity with which this mark occurs says much for the fortunate position  in which zoologists stationed in Calcutta find themselves as regards  zoological literature, for I do not think that anything essential has  been omitted.    It remains for me to express my gratitude to those who have assisted me  in the preparation of this volume. The names of those who have  contributed specimens for examination have already been mentioned. I  have to thank the Trustees of the Indian Museum not only for their  liberal interpretation of my duties as an officer of the Museum but also  for the use of all the drawings and photographs and some of the blocks  from which this volume is illustrated. Several of the latter have  already been used in the \"Records of the Indian Museum.\" From the Editor  of the \"Fauna\" I have received valuable suggestions, and I am indebted  to Dr. Weltner of the Berlin Museum for no less valuable references to  literature. Mr. F. H. Gravely, Assistant Superintendent in the Indian  Museum, has saved me from several errors by his criticism.    The majority of the figures have been drawn by the draftsmen of the  Indian Museum, Babu Abhoya Charan Chowdhary, and of the Marine Survey of  India, Babu Shib Chandra Mondul, to both of whom I am much indebted for  their accuracy of delineation.    No work dealing with the sponges of India would be complete without a  tribute to the memory of H. J. Carter, pioneer in the East of the study  of lower invertebrates, whose work persists as a guide and an  encouragement to all of us who are of the opinion that biological  research on Indian animals can only be undertaken in India, and that  even systematic zoological work can be carried out in that country with  success. I can only hope that this, the first volume in the official  Fauna of the Indian Empire to be written entirely in India, may prove  not unworthy of his example.    Indian Museum, Calcutta      Oct. 23rd, 1910.          PART I.    FRESHWATER SPONGES    (SPONGILLIDAE).          INTRODUCTION TO PART I.      I.    THE PHYLUM PORIFERA.    The phylum Porifera or Spongiae includes the simplest of the Metazoa or  multicellular animals. From the compound Protozoa its members are  distinguished by the fact that the cells of which they are composed  exhibit considerable differentiation both in structure and in function,  and are associated together in a definite manner, although they are not  combined to form organs and systems of organs as in the higher Metazoa.  Digestion, for instance, is performed in the sponges entirely by  individual cells, into the substance of which the food is taken, and the  products of digestion are handed on to other cells without the  intervention of an alimentary canal or a vascular system, while there is  no structure in any way comparable to the nervous system of more highly  organized animals.    The simplest form of sponge, which is known as an olynthus, is a hollow  vase-like body fixed at one end to some solid object, and with an  opening called the osculum at the other. The walls are perforated by  small holes, the pores, from which the name Porifera is derived.    Externally the surface is protected by a delicate membrane formed of  flattened cells and pierced by the pores, while the interior of the vase  is covered with curious cells characteristic of the sponges, and known  as choanocytes or collar-cells. They consist of minute oval or  pear-shaped bodies, one end of which is provided with a rim or collar of  apparently structureless membrane, while a flagellum or whip-like lash  projects from the centre of the surface surrounded by the collar. These  collar-cells are practically identical with those of which the Protozoa  known as Choanoflagellata consist; but it is only in the sponges[K] that  they are found constantly associated with other cells unlike themselves.         [Footnote K: Except in \"_Proterospongia_,\" an organism of       doubtful affinities but not a sponge. It consists of a mass       of jelly containing ordinary cells, with collar-cells       _outside_.]    In addition to the collar-cells, which form what is called the gastral  layer, and the external membrane (the derma or dermal membrane), the  sponge contains cells of various kinds embedded in a structureless  gelatinous substance, through which they have the power of free  movement. Most of these cells have also the power of changing their form  in an \"amoeboid\" manner; that is to say, by projecting and withdrawing  from their margin mobile processes of a more or less finger-like form,  but unstable in shape or direction. The protoplasm of which some of the  cells are formed is granular, while that of others is clear and  translucent. Some cells, which (for the time being at any rate) do not  exhibit amoeboid movements, are glandular in function, while others  again give rise in various ways to the bodies by means of which the  sponge reproduces its kind. There is evidence, however, that any one  kind of cell, even those of the membrane and the gastral layer, can  change its function and its form in case of necessity.    Most sponges possess a supporting framework or skeleton. In some it is  formed entirely of a horny substance called spongin (as in the  bath-sponge), in others it consists of spicules of inorganic matter  (either calcareous or siliceous) secreted by special cells, or of such  spicules bound together by spongin. Extraneous objects, such as  sand-grains, are frequently included in the skeleton. The spongin is  secreted like the spicules by special cells, but its chemical structure  is much more complicated than that of the spicules, and it is not  secreted (at any rate in most cases) in such a way as to form bodies of  a definite shape. In the so-called horny sponges it resembles the chitin  in which insects and other arthropods are clothed.           *     *     *     *     *    In no adult sponge do the collar-cells completely cover the whole of the  internal surface, the olynthus being a larval form, and by no means a  common larval form. It is only found in certain sponges with calcareous  spicules. As the structure of the sponge becomes more complicated the  collar-cells are tucked away into special pockets or chambers known as  ciliated chambers, and finally the approach to these chambers, both from  the external surface and from the inner or gastral cavity, takes the  form of narrow tubes or canals instead of mere pores. With further  complexity the simple internal cavity tends to disappear, and the sponge  proliferates in such a way that more than one osculum is formed. In the  class Demospongiae, to which the sponges described in this volume belong,  the whole system is extremely complicated.    The skeleton of sponges, when it is not composed wholly of spongin,  consists of, or at any rate contains, spicules that have a definite  chemical composition and definite shapes in accordance with the class,  order, family, genus, and species of the sponge. Formerly sponges were  separated into calcareous, siliceous, and horny sponges by the nature of  their skeleton; and although the system of classification now adopted  has developed into a much more complex one and a few sponges are known  that have both calcareous and siliceous spicules, the question whether  the spicules are formed of salts of lime or of silica (strictly speaking  of opal) is very important. All Demospongiae that have spicules at all  have them of the latter substance, and the grade Monaxonida, in which  the freshwater sponges constitute the family Spongillidae, is  characterized by the possession of spicules that have typically the form  of a needle pointed at both ends. Although spicules of this simple form  may be absent in species that belong to the grade, the larger spicules,  which are called megascleres, have not normally more than one main axis  and are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36564"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 3, October, 1851 (#8)"],[1," he  would \"stand treat\" with the world; yet he lets an Englishman (of all men!)  gratuitously amuse his leisure, satisfy his thirst for knowledge, and  clothe the nakedness of his mind. If Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, or Mr.  Dickens, were to offer to pay for a pair of trousers for Brother Jonathan,  he would knock him down; or if Miss Bell, or whatever is the name of the  lady who wrote \"Jane Eyre,\" and her sisters, pretended to make him up a  dozen fine shirts as a charity, I think he would go out of his senses. He  would rather go bare to the end of his days than owe such an obligation to  any he or she Briton in existence; but what are such favors to those which  he unblushingly accepts, year after year, from Sir Edward Bulwer and Miss  Bell?    But I think, sir, with submission, that an injury has been done to the  cause of copyright by resting it on false abstract grounds, which cannot  be, and never have been, carried out. If a man has a rightful monopoly in  his book, merely because he has produced it, your law is unjust and  piratical in fixing a term to copyright--for why should you take away a  man's property after he has enjoyed it a certain number of years? On the  contrary, one would suppose that the longer he has enjoyed it the more  perfect his right, and the greater the wrong to deprive him of it. Time  converts even what is unjustly acquired into a legitimate possession--how  much more that which the owner has actually created? I would put the matter  on simple, concrete grounds, which all men can appreciate. The production  of books is an element of civilization, by the common consent of nations.  Books cannot be produced unless in some way they procure the authors a  subsistence. And whoever produces by his labor a beneficial thing, is  entitled to a reasonable compensation from those who are thereby benefited.  In former times, when readers were scarce, as copies were costly, the rich,  or sovereigns, supported authors directly, by pensions or otherwise. It is  now conceded that the best mode of rewarding them is by allowing them an  exclusive copyright in their works, and all civilized nations do so. But  this mode of remuneration being once established, a foreign author, coming  personally, or in his work, into a country, \"has as much moral right to his  book as he has to his baggage,\" and it is as barbarous to plunder him of  the one as of the other. Why, when was there a time in Europe, or even in  Asia or the antique world, that princes and states did not receive and  cherish, and nobly reward, foreign men of letters? Are they to be more  ignobly treated now that the people have become patrons? But, if deaf to  the voice of honor, hear that of justice. Those who enjoy their works are  bound to remunerate them for what they have produced at a great expenditure  of time, money, and soul-wearing labor. That \"the laborer is worthy of his  hire,\" is a divine sentence which sooner or later will judge all those by  whom that hire is by fraud \"kept back.\" A country which refuses a fair  copyright to authors, whether native or foreign, condemns itself to  barbarism. It cultivates in itself a spirit of violence, aggravated by  ingratitude to benefactors. There is, too, a sort of indelicacy in this  injury, which even the law of reprisal cannot excuse. The benefit which the  author of genius confers is something personal. You might as well, if some  savage tribe ravished your women, condemn its females, when captured, to  insult and dishonor.    Moreover, to refuse copyright to any class of authors (and here, again, I  agree with Sir Bulwer), is to refuse it, in part, to all. The native author  is robbed of his just hire by such a law, as much as the foreigner. I am  compelled by the existing law of American copyright to part with my books  for a sum which is under their natural price, and which is not a  remunerating price, because I am undersold by reprints for which the  authors are paid nothing. Look the fact in the face, ye readers of cheap  reprints, who are unwilling to abandon an unjust privilege, which affords  you so much pleasure at so low a rate. I have written a book. I have spent  years in writing or learning to write it. Perhaps I could do nothing else.  The influence of the literary atmosphere in which all who read the English  language are forced to live, acting on my special organization, has made  literary production a necessary resource. It is the same as if I were a  poor shirt-maker, over whose sorrows a Hood has taught you to weep and be  indignant. At all events, you approve of my writing, or you would not have  read my book so extensively. And yet, because you can refuse to pay foreign  authors for books of the same kind, you oblige me to take a nominal price  for mine--a price for which it could not be produced by any man living, and  less than it would command if you honestly paid for such labor in other  instances. You have beaten me down most unfairly. I consider it so; and if  every one of the 10 or 12,000 buyers of the cheap edition of \"Lady Alice\"  were to send me a \"quarter\" (1_s._) by mail, I should regard it as a simple  restitution; nor would the sum total cover my expenses while writing it.    So far, then, Sir Edward Lytton and myself (if it is not too great  presumption in me to join myself with him) cordially agree. And further, it  is a most nonsensical and absurd policy for a country thus to swamp its  native literature, and to depress and degrade the whole class of native  writers. No nation can afford to let foreigners write for it; it would be  as unwise as to let them fight its battles. I may add that no nation can  afford to embitter its own writers against itself by producing in their  minds a sense of injustice. Strong as our feeling of nationality  undoubtedly is, it will not stand this for ever. It has seemed strange to  some that an American should have written such a book as \"Lady Alice,\" the  author of which appears, at first sight, to have expatriated his mind, if  not his heart. His being an episcopal clergyman accounts for it in  part--for the Church is essentially of Old England, and its clergy and more  devoted members are morally domiciled in England, with whose institutions  and social system they have a stronger sympathy than with those of their  own country. Moreover, for years, he lived only among Englishmen of that  class which is most intensely attached to things as they are--a part of the  time in England itself. These circumstances made the thing possible. But  despair of obtaining any thing like a fair copyright for an American book  made it actual--led him to lay aside a projected American story, and try  his hand at an English novel, with a bent less serious: at first, indeed,  not without some idea of caricature, in a gay, lawless, audacious spirit,  in defiance of cant of every kind: but the calm, methodical, somewhat  mechanical [Greek: ethos] of actual English life, when he saw it and felt  its restraints, tamed down these peculiarities somewhat. The result was a  book which truly excited more surprise than sympathy in England--but which,  in America, proved its real nationality by bursting in a trice all the  bonds of clique, and, in spite of its acknowledged faults, securing near a  hundred thousand readers in a few months. If copyright had been protected  as it ought, I should have been reimbursed by so large a sale; but, as it  was, even this successful book paid me less than a day laborer could have  earned in the time I was writing it, in any part of the States.    But now I want Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton and Mr. Colburn to tell me what  good it will do English authors and publishers for you to imitate in this  respect the injustice and folly of your transatlantic cousins. Because  \"literature is in a depressed state,\" which Sir Edward asserts to be a  fact--and because Mr. Colburn cannot afford to give one hundred pounds for  a book for which once he would have given L1000--they propose, if I  understand them, to have recourse to an unlimited pirating of American  literature. I should think (if your British pride will tolerate the  expression of my opinion) that the true remedy would be to give a stringent  copyright to American authors. Pray which injured the English book-market  most--Mr. Colburn's issue of a few hundreds of \"Lady Alice\" at a guinea and  a half, or Mr. Bohn's issue of as many thousands of Mayo's \"Kaloolah\" at a  shilling? Or do they think, as Sir E. Bulwer Lytton seems to imply, that,  except Cooper and Irving, we have no authors whose works are readable in  Britain? \"Typee,\" and \"The Scarlet Letter,\" and \"The Reveries of a  Bachelor,\" and the two works above mentioned, tell a different story. Who  can deny the genius and artistic power of Hawthorne, or the clear English  simplicity of his style? And if Ik Marvel falls much behind Geoffrey  Crayon, we, their countrymen, are no judges--although it is true that the  former has fallen upon an affected age. I admit our deterioration. Or is it  supposed that we shall cease producing if the possibility of English  copyright is taken away? That would be a great mistake. Men who have a  vocation for it will write, well or ill, even if they starve, as London  garrets can testify. And there is no danger of our starving absolutely.  Successful books pay their authors, not adequately, but enough to keep soul  and body together. In light literature (so-called, perhaps, because it  demands entire devotion and unceasing toil to arrive at excellence in  it)--in light literature, which pays best here as well as elsewhere, there  is a distinct demand for native works, which all the competition of the  cheap pamphlet novels of the Harpers cannot wholly extinguish, and it is by  the feeble, but real aid of this national taste that we exist. For my part,  I feel a sort of Coriolanus pride in having got nothing, as I may say, for  a book which had an unprecedented run; "]]]
