They have other weapons like lances, hardened by fire, and  clubs with the knobs very well carved. They wage war among themselves with  people who do not speak their language, carrying it on with great cruelty,  giving no quarter, if not inflicting greater punishment. When they go to  war they take their women with them; not because they fight, but because  they carry the provisions in rear of the men. A woman carries a burden on  her back, which a man would not carry, for thirty or forty leagues, as we  have seen many times. They have no leader, nor do they march in any order,  no one being captain. The cause of their wars is not the desire of rule  nor to extend the limits of their dominions, but owing to some ancient  feud that has arisen among them in former times. When asked why they  made war, they have no other answer than that it is to avenge the death  of their ancestors and their fathers. They have neither king nor lord,  nor do they obey anyone, but live in freedom. Having moved themselves to  wage war, when the enemy have killed or captured any of them, the oldest  relation arises and goes preaching through the streets and calling upon  his countrymen to come with him to avenge the death of his relation,  and thus he moves them by compassion. They do not bring men to justice,  nor punish a criminal. Neither the mother nor the father chastise their  children, and it is wonderful that we never saw a quarrel among them. They  show themselves simple in their talk, and are very sharp and cunning  in securing their ends. They speak little, and in a low voice. They use  the same accents as ourselves, forming their words either on the palate,  the teeth, or the lips, only they have other words for things. Great is  the diversity of languages, for in a hundred leagues we found such change  in the language that the inhabitants could not understand each other.    Their mode of life is very barbarous, for they have no regular time for  their meals, but they eat at any time that they have the wish, as often  at night as in the day--indeed, they eat at all hours. They take their  food on the ground, without napkin or any other cloth, eating out of  earthen pots which they make, or out of half calabashes. They sleep in  certain very large nets made of cotton,[69] and suspended in the air;  and if this should seem a bad way of sleeping, I say that it is pleasant  to sleep in that manner, and that we slept better in that way than  in coverlets.[70] They are a people of cleanly habits as regards their  bodies, and are constantly washing themselves. When they empty the stomach  they do everything so as not to be seen, and in this they are clean and  decent; but in making water they are dirty and without shame, for while  talking with us they do such things without turning round, and without  any shame. They do not practise matrimony among them, each man taking as  many women as he likes, and when he is tired of a woman he repudiates her  without either injury to himself or shame to the woman, for in this matter  the woman has the same liberty as the man. They are not very jealous,  but lascivious beyond measure, the women much more so than the men. I do  not further refer to their contrivances for satisfying their inordinate  desires, so that I may not offend against modesty. They are very prolific  in bearing children, and in their pregnancy they are not excused any work  whatever. The parturition is so easy, and accompanied by so little pain,  that they are up and about the next day. They go to some river to wash,  and presently are quite well, appearing on the water like fish. If they  are angry with their husbands they easily cause abortion with certain  poisonous herbs or roots, and destroy the child. Many infants perish in  this way. They are gifted with very handsome and well-proportioned bodies,  and no part or member is to be seen that is not well formed. Although  they go naked, yet that which should be concealed is kept between the  thighs so that it cannot be seen. Yet there no one cares, for the same  impression is made on them at seeing anything indecent as is made on  us at seeing a nose or mouth. Among them it is considered strange if  a woman has wrinkles on the bosom from frequent parturition, or on the  belly. All parts are invariably preserved after the parturition as they  were before. They showed an excessive desire for our company.    We did not find that these people had any laws; they cannot be called Moors  nor Jews, but worse than Gentiles. For we did not see that they offered any  sacrifices, nor have they any place of worship. I judge their lives to be  Epicurean. Their habitations are in common. Their dwellings, are like huts,  but strongly built of very large trees, and covered with palm leaves,  secure from tempests and winds. In some places they are of such length  and width that we found 600 souls in one single house. We found villages  of only thirteen houses where there were 4,000 inhabitants. They build  the villages every eight or ten years, and when asked why they did this,  they replied that it was because the soil was corrupted and infected, and  caused diseases in their bodies, so they chose a new site. Their wealth  consists of the feathers of birds of many colours, or \"paternosters\" made  of the fins of fishes, or of white or green stones, which they wear on  their necks, lips, and ears; and of many other things which have no value  for us. They have no commerce, and neither buy nor sell. In conclusion,  they live, and are content with what nature has given them.    They have none of the riches which are looked upon as such in our Europe  and in other parts, such as gold, pearls, or precious stones: and even  if they have them in their country, they do not work to get them. They  are liberal in their giving, for it is wonderful if they refuse anything,  and also liberal in asking, as soon as they make friends. Their greatest  sign of friendship is to give their wives or daughters, and a father  and mother considered themselves highly honoured when they brought us a  daughter, especially if she was a virgin, that we should sleep with her,  and in doing this they use terms of warm friendship.    When they die they use several kinds of burial. Some bury their dead  with water and food, thinking they will want it. They have no ceremonies  of lights, nor of weeping. In some other places they practise a most  barbarous and inhuman kind of interment. This is that when a sick or  infirm person is almost in the throes of death, his relations carry him  into a great wood, and fasten one of those nets in which they sleep to  two trees. They put their dying relation into it, and dance round him  the whole of one day. When night comes on they put water and food enough  for four or six days at his head, and then leave him alone, returning  to their village. If the sick man can help himself, and eats and lives  so as to return to the village, they receive him with ceremony, but few  are those who escape. Most of them die, and that is their sepulchre. They  have many other customs, which are omitted to avoid prolixity. In their  illnesses they use various kinds of medicines, so different from ours  that we marvelled how anyone escaped. I often saw a patient ill with  fever, when the disease was at its height; bathed with quantities of  cold water from head to foot. Then they made a great fire all round,  making him turn backwards and forwards for two hours until he was tired,  and he was then left to sleep. Many were cured. They also attend to the  diet, keep the patient without food, and draw blood, not from the arm,  but from the thighs and loins, and from the calves of the legs. They  also provoke vomiting by putting one of their herbs into the mouth, and  they use many other remedies which it would take long to recount. They  abound much in phlegm and in blood, on account of their food, which  consists of roots, fruit, and fish. They have no sowing of grain, nor of  any kind of corn. But for their common use they eat the root of a tree,  from which they make very good flour, and they call it _Iuca_.[71]  Others call it _Cazabi_[72] and _Ignami_.[73] They eat little flesh,  unless it be human flesh, and your Magnificence must know that they  are so inhuman as to transgress regarding this most bestial custom. For  they eat all their enemies that they kill or take, as well females as  males, with so much barbarity that it is a brutal thing to mention,  how much more to see it, as has happened to me an infinite number of  times. They were astonished at us when we told them that we did not eat  our enemies. Your Magnificence may believe for certain that they have  many other barbarous customs, for in these four voyages I have seen so  many things different from our customs that I have written a book,[74]  to be called THE FOUR VOYAGES, in which I have related the greater part  of the things I saw, very clearly and to the best of my abilities. I have  not yet published it, because my own affairs are in such a bad state  that I have no taste for what I have written, yet I am much inclined  to publish it. In this work will be seen all the events in detail, I  therefore do not enlarge upon them here. For in the course of the said  work we shall see many other special details; so this will suffice for  what is general. In this beginning I did not see anything of much value  in the land except some indications of gold. I believe that this was  because we did not know the language, and so we could not benefit by the  resources of the land.    We resolved to depart and to proceed onwards, coasting along the land; in  which voyage we made many tacks, and had intercourse with many tribes. At  the end of certain days we came to a port where we were in the greatest  danger, and it pleased the Lord to save us. It was in this way.

Bradley_, quietly withdrew  from the pier at Gloucester, Massachusetts, and, turning her prow  oceanward, slowly, quietly started on her historic journey to the Arctic  seas.    In the tawny glow of sunset, which was fading in the western sky, she  looked, with her new sails unfurled, her entire body newly painted a  spotless white, like some huge silver bird alighting upon the sunshot  waters of the bay. On board, all was quiet. I stood alone, gazing back  upon the picturesque fishing village with a tender throb at my heart,  for it was the last village of my country which I might see for years,  or perhaps ever.    Along the water's edge straggled tiny ramshackle boat houses,  dun-colored sheds where fish are dried, and the humble miniature homes  of the fisherfolk, in the windows of which lights soon after appeared.  On the bay about us, fishing boats were lazily bobbing up and down; in  some, old bearded fishermen with broad hats, smoking clay and corncob  pipes, were drying their seines. Other boats went by, laden with  wriggling, silver-scaled fish; along the shore I could still see tons of  fish being unloaded from scores of boats. Through the rosy twilight,  voices came over the water, murmurous sounds from the shore, cries from  the sea mixed with the quaint oaths of fisherfolk at work. Ashore, the  boys of the village were testing their firecrackers for the morrow;  sputtering explosions cracked through the air. Occasionally a faint fire  rocket scaled the sky. But no whistles tooted after our departure. No  visiting crowds of curiosity-seekers ashore were frenziedly waving us  good-bye.    An Arctic expedition had been born without the usual clamor. Prepared in  one month, and financed by a sportsman whose only mission was to hunt  game animals in the North, no press campaign heralded our project, no  government aid had been asked, nor had large contributions been sought  from private individuals to purchase luxuries for a Pullman jaunt of a  large party Poleward. For, although I secretly cherished the ambition,  there was no definite plan to essay the North Pole.    At the Holland House in New York, a compact was made between John R.  Bradley and myself to launch an Arctic expedition. Because of my  experience, Mr. Bradley delegated to me the outfitting of the  expedition, and had turned over to me money enough to pay the costs of  the hunting trip. A Gloucester fishing schooner had been purchased by  me and was refitted, covered and strengthened for ice navigation. To  save fuel space and to gain the advantage of a steamer, I had a Lozier  gasoline motor installed. There had been put on board everything of  possible use and comfort in the boreal wild. As it is always possible  that a summer cruising ship is likely to be lost or delayed a year,  common prudence dictated a preparation for the worst emergencies.    So far as the needs of my own personal expedition were concerned, I had  with me on the yacht plenty of hard hickory wood for the making of  sledges, instruments, clothing and other apparatus gathered with much  economy during my former years of exploration, and about one thousand  pounds of pemmican. These supplies, necessary to offset the danger of  shipwreck and detention by ice, were also all that would be required for  a Polar trip. When, later, I finally decided on a Polar campaign, extra  ship supplies, contributed from the boat, were stored at Annoatok.  There, also, my supply of pemmican was amplified by the stores of walrus  meat and fat prepared during the long winter by myself, Rudolph Francke  and the Eskimos.    As the yacht slowly soared toward the ocean, and night descended over  the fishing village with its home lights glimmering cheerfully as the  stars one by one flecked the firmament with dots of fire, I felt that at  last I had embarked upon my destiny. Whether I should be able to follow  my heart's desire I did not know; I did not dare hazard a guess. But I  was leaving my country, now on the eve of celebrating its freedom,  behind me; I had elected to live in a world of ice and cold, of hunger  and death, which lay before me--thousands of miles to the North.    Day by day passed monotonously; we only occasionally saw writhing curves  of land to the west of us; about us was the illimitable sea. That I had  started on a journey which might result in my starting for the Pole,  that my final chance had come, vaguely thrilled me. Yet the full purport  of my hope seemed beyond me. On the journey to Sydney my mind was full.  I thought of the early days of my childhood, of the strange ambition  which grew upon me, of my struggles, and the chance which favored me in  the present expedition.    In the early days of my childhood, of which I now had only indistinct  glimmerings, I remembered a restless surge in my little bosom, a  yearning for something that was vague and undefined. This was, I  suppose, that nebulous desire which sometimes manifests itself in early  youth and later is asserted in strivings toward some splendid, sometimes  spectacular aim. My boyhood was not happy. As a tiny child I was  discontented, and from the earliest days of consciousness I felt the  burden of two things which accompanied me through later life--an innate  and abnormal desire for exploration, then the manifestation of my  yearning, and the constant struggle to make ends meet, that sting of  poverty, which, while it tantalizes one with its horrid grind, sometimes  drives men by reason of the strength developed in overcoming its  concomitant obstacles to some extraordinary accomplishment.    As a very small boy, I remember being fascinated by the lure of a  forbidden swimming pool. One day, when but little over five, I, impelled  to test the depth, plunged to the center, where the water was above my  head, and nearly lost my life. I shall never forget that struggle, and  though I nearly gave out, in that short time I learned to swim. It seems  to me now I have been swimming and struggling ever since.    Abject poverty and hard work marked my school days. When quite a boy,  after the death of my father, I came to New York. I sold fruit at one of  the markets. I saved my money. I enjoyed no luxuries. These days vividly  occur in my mind. Later I engaged in a dairy business in Brooklyn, and  on the meager profits undertook to study medicine.    At that time the ambition which beset me was undirected; it was only  later that I found, almost by accident, what became its focusing point.  I graduated from the University of New York in 1890. I felt (as what  young man does not?) that I possessed unusual qualifications and  exceptional ability. An office was fitted up, and my anxiety over the  disappearing pennies was eased by the conviction that I had but to hang  out my shingle and the place would be thronged with patients. Six months  passed. There had been about three patients.    I recall sitting alone one gloomy winter day. Opening a paper, I read  that Peary was preparing his 1891 expedition to the Arctic. I cannot  explain my sensations. It was as if a door to a prison cell had opened.  I felt the first indomitable, commanding call of the Northland. To  invade the Unknown, to assail the fastness of the white, frozen  North--all that was latent in me, the impetus of that ambition born in  childhood, perhaps before birth, and which had been stifled and starved,  surged up tumultuously within me.    I volunteered, and accompanied Peary, on this, the expedition of  1891-92, as surgeon. Whatever merit my work possessed has been cited by  others.    Unless one has been in the Arctic, I suppose it is impossible to  understand its fascination--a fascination which makes men risk their  lives and endure inconceivable hardships for, as I view it now, no  profitable personal purpose of any kind. The spell was upon me then. It  was upon me as I recalled those early days on the _Bradley_ going  Northward. With a feeling of sadness I realize that the glamor is all  gone now.    On the Peary and all my subsequent expeditions I served without pay.    On my return from that trip I managed to make ends meet by meager  earnings from medicine. I was nearly always desperately hard pressed for  money. I tried to organize several cooeperative expeditions to the  Arctic. These failed. I then tried to arouse interest in Antarctic  exploration, but without success. Then came the opportunity to join the  Belgian Antarctic Expedition, again without pay.    On my return I dreamed of a plan to attain the South Pole, and for a  long time worked on a contrivance for that end--an automobile arranged  to travel over ice. Financial failure again confronted me.  Disappointment only added to my ambition; it scourged me to a  determination, a conviction that--I want you to remember this, to bear  in mind the mental conviction which buoyed me--I must and should  succeed. It is always this innate conviction which encourages men to  exceptional feats, to tremendous failures or splendid, single-handed  success.    A summer in the Arctic followed my Antarctic trip, and I returned to  invade the Alaskan wilds. I succeeded in scaling Mt. McKinley. After my  Alaskan expeditions, the routine of my Brooklyn office work seemed like  the confinement of prison. I fretted and chafed at the thought. Let me  have a chance, and I would succeed. This thought always filled my mind.  I convinced myself that in some way the attainment of one of the  Poles--the effort on which I had spent sixteen years--would become  possible.    I had no money. My work in exploration had netted me nothing, and all my  professional income was soon spent. Unless you have felt the goading,  devilish grind of poverty hindering you, dogging you, you cannot know  the mental fury into"]]]
