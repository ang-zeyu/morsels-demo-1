That piled on the rim of the opening was  of the consistency of thick mud, indicating that the female had voided  fluid first on the surface of the earth and again inside the cavity to  soften the soil. Subsequently during eight days her activities were  similar but not so extensive as on the day described above. It was  determined by daily palpation that she laid her eggs somewhere in the  general area of the ravine on June 15 but the nest could not be found.      No completed nests containing eggs were discovered at the Damm Farm  but the locations of several robbed nests and partly completed nests  provided some information on preferred sites. The nests found were on  bare, well-drained, sloping areas and were protected from erosion by  upslope clumps of sod or rocks. The nest cavity illustrated in Plate  21 was at the edge of the sod-line on the upper lip of the west-facing  bank of a ravine. One nest had been excavated in a shallow den beneath  an overhanging limestone rock. Three nests were on west- or  south-facing slopes and one was on the north-facing bank of a ravine.  Box turtles presumably select bare areas for nesting because of the  greater ease of digging. One female at the Damm Farm was thought to  have laid her eggs in a cultivated field and William R. Brecheisen  told me he discovered two nests in a wheat field being plowed in July,  1955.    The repeated excavation of trial nest cavities presumably exhausts the  supply of liquid in the female's bladder. Frequent imbibing of water  is probably necessary if the search for a nesting site is continued  for more than a day or two. Standing water was usually available in  ponds, ravines, ditches, and other low areas at the Damm Farm in June.  Nesting in June, therefore, is advantageous not only because of the  greater length of time provided for incubation and hatching but also  because of the amount of water available for drinking. Females can  probably be more selective in the choice of a nesting site if their  explorations are not limited by lack of water.    Females of _T. ornata_, in all instances known to me, began excavation  of their nests in early evening and laid their eggs after dark; Allard  (1935:328) reported the same behavior for _T. carolina_.    William R. Brecheisen, on July 22, 1955, at his farm, two miles south  and one mile west of Welda, Anderson County, Kansas, observed that a  large female began digging a nest in an earth-filled stock tank at  6:00 P. M. At first she moved her body about on the surface of the  earth, loosening it and pushing it aside with all four legs, making a  depression approximately two inches deep and large enough to  accommodate her body. At 7:30 P. M. she began digging alternately with  her hind feet at the bottom of the depression. Digging continued until  10:00 P. M., at which time the nest cavity was three inches deep, and  three inches in diameter, with a smaller opening at the top. Six eggs  were laid in the next half-hour. Covering of the nest probably took  more than one hour but observations were terminated after the final  egg was laid. By the following morning the nest-site had been  completely covered and was no different in appearance from the rest of  the earthen floor of the tank. (Brecheisen observed more of the  nesting than anyone else has recorded and I am obliged to him for  permission to abstract, as per the above paragraph, the notes that he  wrote on the matter.)    A nest made by a captive female at the Reservation was of normal  proportions except for an accessory cavity that opened from the neck  of the nest, immediately below the surface of the ground. This smaller  cavity contained a single egg. This peculiar nest may have resulted  from the efforts of two different females since several were kept in  the same outdoor pen.    Ten adult females were kept in an outdoor cage in the summer of 1955.  The cage was raised off the ground on stilts and its floor was covered  with 12 inches of black, loamy soil. A small pan of water was always  available in the cage and the turtles were fed greens, fruit, and  table scraps each evening. Nesting activity was first noted on June  21, when one of the females was digging a hole in a corner of the  enclosure. She dug with alternate strokes of her fully-extended hind  legs in the manner described (Legler, 1954:141) for painted turtles  (_Chrysemys picta bellii_). Nevertheless, digging was much less  efficient than in _Chrysemys_, because of the narrow hind foot of the  female _T. ornata_; approximately half of the earth removed by any one  stroke rolled back into the nest or was pulled back when she  reinserted her leg. The female stopped digging when I made sudden  movements or held my hand in front of her. Digging continued for  approximately 45 minutes; then the female moved away and burrowed  elsewhere in the cage. The nest cavity that she left was little more  than a shallow depression. Three other females were digging nests  early in the evening on July 3, 5, and 8; in each of these instances  the female stopped digging to eat when food was placed in the cage and  completed the nesting process, unobserved, later in the evening. In  each instance where nest-digging by captive females was observed, the  hind quarters of the female rested in a preliminary, shallow  depression, and the anterior end of the body was tilted upward at an  angle of 20 to 30 degrees. In late June and early July several eggs  were found, unburied, on the floor of the cage and in the pan of  water.    The excavation of a preliminary cavity by captive females may not  represent a natural phenomenon. Allard (1935) made no mention of it in  his meticulous description of the nesting process in _T. carolina_. It  is worthy of mention, however, that Booth (1958:261) reported the  digging of a preliminary cavity by a captive individual of _Gopherus  agassizi_.      Eggs    The number of eggs in 23 clutches ranged from two to eight (mean, 4.7  A+- 1.37 [sigma]); clutches of four, five, and six eggs were most  common, occurring in 18 (78 per cent) instances. The tendency for  large females to lay more eggs than small females (Fig. 6) was not so  pronounced as that reported by Cagle (1950:38) for _Pseudemys  scripta_. The small size of _T. ornata_, in comparison with other  emyid turtles, seemingly limits the number of eggs that can be  accommodated internally. The number of eggs per clutch in T. carolina  [2 to 7, average 4.2, Allard (1935:331)], is nearly the same as that  of _T. ornata_.       [Illustration: FIG. 6. The relation of plastral length to         number of eggs laid by 21 females of _T. o. ornata_ from         eastern Kansas.]    Shells of the eggs are translucent and pinkish or yellowish when the  eggs are in the oviducts. After several days outside the oviducts the  shells become chalky-white and nearly opaque. Eggs incubated in the  laboratory retained the pinkish color somewhat longer than elsewhere  on their under-surfaces, which were in contact with moist cotton, but  eventually even this part of the shell became white. Infertile eggs  remained translucent and eventually became dark yellow, never becoming  white; they could be distinguished from fertile eggs on the basis of  color alone. Shells of infertile eggs became brittle and slimy after  several weeks.    The outer layer of the shell of a freshly laid egg is brittle and  cracks when the egg is dented. After a few days, when the eggs begin  to expand, the shell becomes flexible and has a leathery texture. The  shell is finely granulated but appears smooth to the unaided eye. The  granulations are approximately the same as those illustrated by  Agassiz (1857:Pl. 7, Fig. 18) for _T. carolina_.    Eggs are ellipsoidal. Data concerning size and weight (consisting of  mean, one standard deviation, and extremes, respectively) taken from  42 eggs (representing 9 clutches) within 24 hours after they were  laid, or dissected from oviducts, are as follows: length, 36.06 A+- 2.77  (31.3-40.9); width, 21.72 A+- 1.04 (20.0-26.3); and weight, 10.09 A+- 1.31  (8.0-14.3). There was a general tendency for smaller clutches to have  larger eggs; the largest and heaviest were in the smallest clutch (two  eggs) and the smallest were in the largest clutch (eight eggs). Risley  (1933:697) reported such a correlation in _Sternotherus odoratus_, as  did Allard (1935:331) in _T. carolina_. Measurements in the literature  of the size of eggs of _T. ornata_ suggest a width greater than that  stated above, probably because some eggs already had begun to expand  when measured.    Eggs of _T. ornata_ expand in the course of incubation, as do other  reptilian eggs with flexible shells, owing to absorption of water. In  the laboratory, 48 eggs increased by an average of approximately three  grams in weight and three millimeters in width over the entire period  of incubation; increase in width coincided with decrease in length.  Cotton in incubation dishes was kept moist enough so that some water  could be squeezed from it. When the cotton was constantly moist, eggs  showed a fairly steady expansion from the first week of incubation  until hatching. The process could be reversed by allowing the cotton  to dry. Eggs that were allowed to dry for a day or more became grossly  dented or collapsed. Eggs at the periphery of the incubation dish were  ordinarily more seriously affected by drying than were those at the  center or in the bottom of the dish. A generous re-wetting of  desiccated eggs and cotton caused the eggs to swell to their original  proportions within 24 hours. Recessions occurred, however, even in the  clutches that received the most nearly even amount of moisture.  Increases in weight and size seemed to reach a peak in the middle of  the incubation period and again immediately before hatching.

The deer had no trouble in snowdrifts, but the wolf       was hindered by them. The wolf followed the deer for about       200 yards along the top of the bank, and then gave up after       losing ground. The wolf had run a total distance of about       250-275 yards. He then lay down and rested.         \"We noticed at least 3 wolves stopped part way down the bank       in the trail of the second deer. However, we did not see       the remaining wolves or the second deer.         \"Eventually (after about 5 minutes), these wolves joined the       first, and all rested. At 4:25 p.m., one wolf started toward       a third deer, which had been lying under a tree while the       former chase took place. The deer was about 150 yards from       where the wolves rested, and it had stood before the wolf       started toward it. We could not see whether the deer or wolf       bolted first, but suddenly both animals were bounding away.       The wolf chased the deer about 125 yards and gave up after       losing ground. The other wolves followed slowly in its       trail, and all assembled and rested. The deer continued       running for at least 1/4-mile.\"         \"27 February 1969. 2 miles N. of August Lake.         \"1059's pack of 5 was heading N.E. at 4:10 p.m. when they       got to within 100 yards of 2 standing deer. The deer had       been standing alertly in a shallow draw, and when at least 2       wolves got to within 100 yards, they fled. The wolves began       running after them.         \"The deer were in snow up to their bellies and had to       hesitate slightly at each bound. But they ran fast. We could       only see one wolf very much [of the time]. It was also       having a difficult time in the snow, and after a total run       of about 250 yards (100 to the deer's original location and       150 after the deer), the wolf lay on the snow and rested       about 10 minutes. The deer ran only about 200 yards more and       stood alertly for the next 20 minutes at least. The wolves       then went on.         \"27 March 1969. About 2 miles S.E. of Central Lakes,       Minnesota.         \"At 3:00 p.m. while we were following wolf 1051 by aircraft       in above location, we saw a deer running very quickly on top       of the crusted snow and then stand and watch its backtrail.       About 1-1/2 minutes later we saw 1051 running along the same       route. We did not see when the deer fled again, but saw it       running about 100 yards from the wolf and doubling back       paralleling its original route. When the wolf got near the       approximate doubling-back point, he lay down and rested for       about 5 minutes. The deer continued fleeing for about 350       yards, stopped, and for several minutes faced its backtrail.       The wolf finally continued on in his original direction,       giving up the chase.         \"At 4:30 p.m.--1-1/2 miles S. of Central Lakes,       Minnesota--Wolf 1051 had come to within 100 yards of       [four-lane] Highway 53 and was hesitant to approach it.       Several cars were going by in both directions. Thus the wolf       headed S. parallel with the highway about 150 yards E. of       it.         \"Suddenly two deer, which we had noticed S. of the wolf       earlier, fled across the highway. The wolf soon got to the       point where they crossed, hesitated about a minute and then       ran across. No cars came at that time.         \"We could not always see the deer or the wolf when W. of the       road because there were several patches of evergreens. The       wolf did head straight W. after crossing the road. Then       about 250 yards W. of this point we saw a deer come out onto       an old woods road which lay in a N.W.-S.E. axis. The deer       ran N.W. on the road and then we saw the wolf where the deer       had come out onto the road. While the deer ran N.W., the       wolf cut into the woods to his right, N.E. We could not see       it then but presumed it was running N.W. paralleling the       road.         \"After the deer had run about 50 yards up the road, it also       headed N.E. into the evergreens. Within a few seconds it       fled right back out and started S.E. down the road. The wolf       was about 50 feet behind it and began gaining.         \"When the deer got back to where the wolf had headed into       the woods from the road before, it also headed N.E. into the       woods. The wolf was then about 20 feet away and the deer was       headed N. around in a circle with the wolf closing in on the       outside. The wolf did not emerge from the evergreens for at       least 15 minutes, nor did we see the deer, so I presume the       wolf killed the deer. [But see entry for April 1.]         \"1 April 1969. Dan Frenzel and I searched the area described       on March 27 for 1 hour and found no sign of a kill. Old wolf       tracks were seen, but only a single wandering track. No       concentration such as usually seen at kills. Best conclusion       is that 1051 did _not_ kill the deer where seen from the air       March 27.\"    We also saw 1055 and her associate actually kill a deer, on February 6,  1969, but we did not realize what was going on and it happened so fast  that we only saw a wolf rushing and biting at the front end of the  downed animal. The chase had to have lasted only a few seconds.    In addition to the above direct observations, we also were able to  piece together from tracks in the snow the chase and successful  encounter between a single wolf and a deer in two instances. In the  first case, on January 25, 1967 (11:50 a.m.), we arrived at the scene  (near Grub Lake, just N. of Snowbank Lake) within an hour of the  encounter, and the wolf was still feeding on the deer, which had been a  2-1/2-year-old female. Mech examined the area from the ground and made  the following observations:         \"The deer had come S.W. down the middle of the lake at a       fast walk, turned around, backtracked a few yards and headed       to the N.W. shore of the lake. Meanwhile a wolf had come at       a trot along the deer's track, but it had cut to the N.W.       shore about 50 yards N.E. of where the deer had. When still       on the ice about 15 feet from shore, the wolf began running       as evidenced by his long bounds. He continued running inland       about 50 feet from shore toward the deer. The deer had       walked inland from the shore and may have stood there about       25 feet from shore. Suddenly it had bounded away. The       bounding wolf track was in the same trail as the deer's for       about 25 yards but then it paralleled the deer's about 5       feet away on the inland side. After about 125 yards from       where the deer flushed, the deer was pulled down. It was       _not_ on its side but rather had sunk into the snow in       more-or-less of an upright position.         \"Apparently the deer had just about reached the shore when       the wolf noticed it, and it detected the wolf. At this time       the wolf must have been up the shore about 50 yards where       his tracks first showed he began bounding. There was no sign       that the wolf had spotted the deer on the lake and had tried       to cut it off from shore by running inland along the shore       and then waiting for the deer to come inland. Once the wolf       had begun bounding, he continued until he pulled the deer       down.... Sign showed that the deer dropped within about 20       feet of where she had begun bleeding.\"    The second case involved a 5-1/2-year-old buck, No. M-28, which had  arthritis of his right hind foot and probably had defective gait (see  Mech and Frenzel p. 35). The attack took place on Basswood Lake on  February 2, 1967, and excerpts from field notes by Mech follow:         \"A single wolf had killed this deer after chasing,       following, or tracking the deer about 3.75 miles. The deer's       last 350 yards was a fast walk--the tracks were one in front       of the other and about 2 feet apart, and there was no       leaping or bounding. Same with the wolf--a fast trot.         \"Where the tracks came together, the deer apparently had       fallen, but there was no blood. From there, the deer dragged       its feet or the wolf for about 25 feet and then went down       again. The wolf circled the deer, and for the next 150 feet,       the 2 animals had fought or scuffled and then the deer had       gone down where we found it.         \"The 4-mile persistence of this wolf--whether tracking,       following, or chasing the deer--is remarkable [compared with       most chases] and makes me believe the wolf had good reason       to believe it could kill the deer.\"    Our observations of wounds on fresh kills confirm the following  description by Stenlund (1955, p. 31) of the location and manner of  attack of wolves on deer: \"No evidence of hamstringing of deer was  found on freshly killed carcasses, although the possibility does exist.  Usually deer are run down from behind, the wolf or wolves biting at  the hind flanks and abdomen, or at the hind flanks and head region  simultaneously.\"    On each kill, all the flesh and much of the skin and bones were eaten,  at least during the winters of 1966-67 and 1967-68. This was also true  during December 1968 and much of January 1969. However, during February  and March 1969 when an unusual accumulation of snow had built up, most  of the kills were only partly eaten (see Mech _et al._, page 51). In  previous years deer freshly killed by single wolves were sometimes  found with only a few pounds of flesh or viscera missing. However, in  each case the carcasses were almost completely cleaned up within a few  days, often by packs to which the single wolves may have belonged (Mech  1970).
