In the performance of this  operation, General Macdonald, in the dead of winter, effected his  heroic passage over the Alps by the pass of the Splugen. Victory  followed their standards.    Moreau, with his magnificent army, commenced a winter campaign on  the Rhine. Between the rivers Iser and Inn there is an enormous  forest, many leagues in extent, of sombre firs and pines. It is  a dreary and almost uninhabited wilderness, of wild ravines, and  tangled under-brush. Two great roads have been cut through the  forest, and sundry woodmen's paths penetrate it at different points.  In the centre there is a little hamlet, of a few miserable huts,  called Hohenlinden. In this forest, on the night of the 3d of  December, 1800, Moreau, with sixty thousand men, encountered the  Archduke John with seventy thousand Austrian troops. The clocks  upon the towers of Munich had but just tolled the hour of midnight  when both armies were in motion, each hoping to surprise the  other. A dismal wintry storm was howling over the tree tops, and  the smothering snow, falling rapidly, obliterated all traces of a  path, and rendered it almost impossible to drag through the drifts  the ponderous artillery. Both parties, in the dark and tempestuous  night, became entangled in the forest, and the heads of their  columns in various places met. An awful scene of confusion, conflict,  and carnage then ensued. Imagination can not compass the terrible  sublimity of that spectacle. The dark midnight, the howlings of  the wintry storm, the driving sheets of snow, the incessant roar  of artillery and of musketry from one hundred and thirty thousand  combatants, the lightning flashes of the guns, the crash of the  falling trees as the heavy cannon-balls swept through the forest,  the floundering of innumerable horsemen bewildered in the pathless  snow, the shout of onset, the shriek of death, and the burst  of martial music from a thousand bands--all combined to present a  scene of horror and of demoniac energy, which probably even this  lost world never presented before. The darkness of the black forest  was so intense, and the snow fell in flakes so thick and fast and  blinding, that the combatants could with difficulty see each other.  They often judged of the foe only by his position, and fired at  the flashes gleaming through the gloom. At times, hostile divisions  became intermingled in inextricable confusion, and hand to hand,  bayonet crossing bayonet, and sword clashing against sword, they  fought with the ferocity of demons; for though the officers of an  army may be influenced by the most elevated sentiments of dignity  and of honor, the mass of the common soldiers have ever been the  most miserable, worthless, and degraded of mankind. As the advancing  and retreating host wavered to and fro, the wounded, by thousands,  were left on hill-sides and in dark ravines, with the drifting  snow, crimsoned with blood, their only blanket; there in solitude  and agony to moan and freeze and die. What death-scenes the eye of  God must have witnessed that night, in the solitudes of that dark,  tempest-tossed, and blood-stained forest! At last the morning dawned  through the unbroken clouds, and the battle raged with renovated  fury. Nearly twenty thousand mutilated bodies of the dead and  wounded were left upon the field, with gory locks frozen to their  icy pillows, and covered with mounds of snow. At last the French were  victorious at every point. The Austrians, having lost twenty-five  thousand men in killed, wounded, and prisoners, one hundred pieces  of artillery, and an immense number of wagons, fled in dismay.  This terrific conflict has been immortalized by the noble epic of  Campbell, which is now familiar wherever the English language is  known.    \"On Linden, when the sun was low,  All bloodless lay the untrodden  snow,  And dark as winter was the flow  Or Iser, rolling rapidly.  \"But Linden saw another sight,  When the drums beat at dead of night,  Commanding fires of death to light  The darkness of her scenery.\"  &c.    The retreating Austrians rushed down the valley of the Danube. Moreau  followed thundering at their heels, plunging balls and shells into  their retreating ranks. The victorious French were within thirty  miles of Vienna, and the capital was in a state of indescribable  dismay. The Emperor again sent imploring an armistice. The  application was promptly acceded to, for Napoleon was contending  only for peace. Yet with unexempled magnanimity, notwithstanding  these astonishing victories, Napoleon made no essential alterations  in his terms. Austria was at his feet. His conquering armies were  almost in sight of the steeples of Vienna. There was no power which  the Emperor could present to obstruct their resistless march. He  might have exacted any terms of humiliation. But still he adhered  to the first terms which he had proposed. Moreau was urged by some  of his officers to press on to Vienna. \"We had better halt,\" he  replied, \"and be content with peace. It is for that alone that we  are fighting.\" The Emperor of Austria was thus compelled to treat  without the concurrence of England. The insurmountable obstacle in  the way of peace was thus removed. At Luneville, Joseph Bonaparte  appeared as the embassador of Napoleon, and Count Cobentzel as  the plenipotentiary of Austria. The terms of the treaty were soon  settled, and France was again at peace with all the world, England  alone excepted. By this treaty the Rhine was acknowledged as the  boundary of France. The Adige limited the possessions of Austria  in Italy; and Napoleon made it an essential article that every  Italian imprisoned in the dungeons of Austria for political offences,  should immediately be liberated. There was to be no interference  by either with the new republics which had sprung up in Italy. They  were to be permitted to choose whatever form of government they  preferred. In reference to this treaty, Sir Walter Scott makes the  candid admission that \"the treaty of Luneville was not much more  advantageous to France than that of Campo Formio. The moderation  of the First Consul indicated at once his desire for peace upon the  Continent, and considerable respect for the bravery and strength of  Austria.\" And Alison, in cautious but significant phrase, remarks,  \"These conditions did not differ materially from those offered by  Napoleon before the renewal of the war; a remarkable circumstance  , when it is remembered how vast and addition the victories of Marengo,  Hohenlinden, and the Mincio, had since made to the preponderance  of the French armies.\"    It was, indeed, \"a remarkable circumstance,\" that Napoleon should  have manifested such unparalleled moderation, under circumstances  of such aggravated indignity. In Napoleon's first Italian campaign  he was contending solely for peace. At last he attained it, in the  treaty of Campo Formio, on terms equally honorable to Austria and  to France. On his return from Egypt, he found the armies of Austria,  three hundred thousand strong, in alliance with England, invading  the territories of the Republic. He implored peace, in the name  of bleeding humanity, upon the fair basis of the treaty of Campo  Formio. His foes regarded his supplication as the imploring cry  of weakness, and treated it with scorn. With new vigor they poured  their tempests of balls and shells upon France. Napoleon sealed the  Alps, and dispersed his foes at Marengo, like autumn leaves before  the Alps, and dispersed his foes at Marengo, like autumn leaves  before the gale. Amid the smoke and the blood and the groans of  the field of his victory, he again wrote imploring peace; and he  wrote in terms dictated by the honest and gushing sympathies of a  humane man, and not in the cold and stately forms of the diplomatist.  Crushed as his foes were, he rose not in his demands, but nobly  said, \"I am still willing to make peace upon the fair basis of  the treaty of Campo Formio.\" His treacherous foes, to gain time to  recruit their armies, that they might fall upon him with renovated  vigor, agreed to an armistice. They then threw all possible  embarrassments in the way of negotiation, and prolonged the armistice  till the winds of winter were sweeping fiercely over the snow-covered  hills of Austria. They thought that it was then too late for  Napoleon to make any movements until spring, and that they had a  long winter before them, in which to prepare for another campaign.  They refused peace. Through storms and freezing gales and drifting  snows the armies of Napoleon marched painfully to Hohenlinden. The  hosts of Austria were again routed, and were swept away, as the  drifted snow flies before the gale. Ten thousand Frenchmen lie cold  in death, the terrible price of the victory. The Emperor of Austria,  in his palaces, heard the thunderings of Napoleon's approaching  artillery. He implored peace. \"It is all that I desire,\" said Napoleon;  \"I am not fighting for ambition or for conquest. I am still ready  to make peace upon the fair basis of the treaty of Campo Formio.\"    While all the Continent was now at peace with France, England alone,  with indomitable resolution, continued the war, without allies,  and without any apparent or avowed object. France, comparatively  powerless upon the seas, could strike no blows which would be felt  by the distant islanders. \"On every point,\" says Sir Walter Scott,  \"the English squadrons annihilated the commerce of France, crippled  her revenues, and blockaded her forts.\" The treaty of Luneville was  signed the 9th of February, 1801. Napoleon lamenting, the continued  hostility of England, in announcing this peace to the people of  France, remarked, \"Why is not this treaty the treaty of a general  peace? This was the wish of France. This has been the constant object  of the efforts of her government.

Then came another busy season when the airship was taken apart for  shipment to the coast of Africa by steamer. It was put into big  boxes and crates, and Eradicate and his mule took them to the  station in Shopton.    \"Don't you want to come to Africa with us, Rad?\" asked Tom, when the  last of the cases had been sent off. \"You'll find a lot of your  friends there.\"    \"No, indeedy, I doan't want t' go,\" answered the colored man,  \"though I would like to see dat country.\"    \"Then why don't you come?\"    \"Hu! Yo' think, Massa Tom, dat I go anywhere dat I might meet dem  little red men what Massa Durban talk about? No, sah, dey might hurt  mah mule Boomerang.\"    \"Oh, I wasn't going to take the mule along,\" said Tom, wondering how  the creature might behave in the airship.    \"Not take Boomerang? Den I SUTTINLY ain't goin,\" and Eradicate  walked off, highly offended, to give some oats to his faithful if  somewhat eccentric steed.    After the airship had been sent off there yet remained much for Tom  Swift to do. He had to send along a number of special tools and  appliances with which to put the ship together again, and also some  with which to repair the craft in case of accident. So that this  time was pretty well occupied. But at length everything was in  readiness, and with his electric rifle knocked down for  transportation, and with his baggage, and that of the others, all  packed, they set off one morning to take the train for New York,  where they would get a steamer for Africa.    Numerous good-bys had been said, and Tom had made a farewell call on  Mary Nestor, promising to bring her some trophy from elephant land,  though he did not quite know what it would be.    Mr. Damon, as the train started, blessed everything he could think  of. Mr. Swift waved his hand and wished his son and the others good  luck, feeling a little lonesome that he could not make one of the  party. Ned was eager with excitement, and anticipation of what lay  before him. Tom Swift was thinking of what he could accomplish with  his electric rifle, and of the wonderful sights he would see, and,  as for the old elephant hunter, he was very glad to be on the move  again, after so many weeks of idleness, for he was a very active  man.    Their journey to New York was uneventful, and they found that the  parts of the airship had safely arrived, and had been taken aboard  the steamer. The little party went aboard themselves, after a day  spent in sight-seeing, and that afternoon the Soudalar, which was  the vessel's name, steamed away from the dock at high tide.    \"Off for Africa!\" exclaimed Tom to Ned, as they stood at the rail,  watching the usual crowd wave farewells. \"Off for Africa, Ned.\"    As Tom spoke, a gentleman who had been standing near him and his  chum, vigorously waving his hand to some one on the pier, turned  quickly. He looked sharply at the young inventor for a moment, and  then exclaimed:    \"Well, if it isn't Tom Swift! Did I hear you say you were going to  Africa?\"    Tom looked at the gentleman with rather a puzzled air for a moment.  The face was vaguely familiar, but Tom could not recall where he had  seen it. Then it came to him in a flash.    \"Mr. Floyd Anderson!\" exclaimed our hero. \"Mr. Anderson of--\"    \"Earthquake Island!\" exclaimed the gentleman quickly, as he extended  his hand. \"I guess you remember that place, Tom Swift.\"    \"Indeed I do. And to think of meeting you again, and on this African  steamer,\" and Tom's mind went back to the perilous days when his  wireless message had saved the castaways of Earthquake Island, among  whom were Mr. Anderson and his wife.    \"Did I hear you say you were going to Africa?\" asked Mr. Anderson,  when he had been introduced to Ned, and the others in Tom's party.    \"That's where we're bound for,\" answered the lad. \"We are going to  elephant land. But where are you going, Mr. Anderson?\"    \"Also to Africa, but not on a trip for pleasure or profit like  yourselves. I have been commissioned by a missionary society to  rescue two of its workers from the heart of the dark continent.\"    \"Rescue two missionaries?\" exclaimed Tom, wonderingly.    \"Yes, a gentleman and his wife, who, it is reported, have fallen  into the hands of a race known as the red pygmies, who hold them  captives!\"          CHAPTER IX    ATTACKED BY A WHALE      Surprise at Mr. Anderson's announcement held Tom silent for a  moment. That the gentleman whom he had been the means of rescuing,  among others, from Earthquake Island, should be met with so  unexpectedly, was quite a coincidence, but when it developed that he  was bound to the same part of the African continent as were Tom and  his friends, and when he said he hoped to rescue some missionaries  from the very red pygmies so feared by the old elephant hunter--this  was enough to startle any one.    \"I see that my announcement has astonished you,\" said Mr. Anderson,  as he noted the look of surprise on the face of the young inventor.    \"It certainly has! Why, that's where we are bound for, in my new  airship. Come down into our cabin, Mr. Anderson, and tell us all  about it. Is your wife with you?\"    \"No, it is too dangerous a journey on which to take her. I have  little hope of succeeding, for it is now some time since the  unfortunate missionaries were captured, but I am going to do my  best, and organize a relief expedition when I get to Africa.\"    Tom said nothing at that moment, but he made up his mind that if it  was at all possible he would lend his aid, that of his airship, and  also get his friends to assist Mr. Anderson. They went below to a  special cabin that had been reserved for Tom's party, and there, as  the ship slowly passed down New York Bay, Mr. Anderson told his  story.    \"I mentioned to you, when we were on Earthquake Island,\" he said to  Tom, \"that I had been in Africa, and had done some hunting. That is  not my calling, as it is that of your friend, Mr. Durban, but I know  the country pretty well. However, I have not been there in some  time.\"    \"My wife and I are connected with a church in New York that, several  years ago, raised a fund and sent two missionaries, Mr. and Mrs.  Jacob Illingway, to the heart of Africa. They built up a little  mission there, and for a time all went well, and they did good work  among the natives.\"    \"They are established in a tribe of friendly black men, of simple  nature, and, while the natives did not become Christianized to any  remarkable extent, yet they were kind to the missionaries. Mr. and  Mrs. Illingway used frequently to write to members of our church,  telling of their work. They also mentioned the fact that adjoining  the country of the friendly blacks there was a tribe of fierce  little red men,--red because of hair of that color all over their  bodies.\"    \"That's right,\" agreed Mr. Durban, shaking his head solemnly.  \"They're red imps, too!\"    \"Mr. Illingway often mentioned in his letters,\" went on Mr.  Anderson, \"that there were frequent fights between the pygmies and  the race of blacks, but the latter had no great fear of their small  enemies. However, it seems that they did not take proper  precautions, for not long ago there was a great battle, the blacks  were attacked by a large force of the red pygmies, who overwhelmed  them by numbers, and finally routed them, taking possession of their  country.\"    \"What became of the missionaries?\" asked Ned Newton.    \"I'll tell you,\" said Mr. Anderson. \"For a long time we heard  nothing, beyond the mere news of the fight, which we read of in the  papers. The church people were very anxious about the fate of Mr.  and Mrs. Illingway, and were talking of sending a special messenger  to inquire about them, when a cablegram came from the headquarters  of the society in London.\"    \"It seems that one of the black natives, named Tomba, who was a sort  of house servant to Mr. and Mrs. Illingway, escaped the general  massacre, in which all his friends were killed. He made his way  through the jungle to a white settlement, and told his story,  relating how the two missionaries had been carried away captive by  the pygmies.\"    \"A terrible fate,\" commented Mr. Durban.    \"Yes, they might better be dead, from all the accounts we can hear,\"  went on Mr. Anderson.    \"Bless my Sunday hat! Don't say that!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Maybe  we can save them, Mr. Anderson.\"    \"That is what I am going to try to do, though it may be too late. As  soon as definite news was received, our church held a meeting,  raised a fund, and decided to send me off to find Mr. and Mrs.  Illingway, if alive, or give them decent burial, if I could locate  their bones. The reason they selected me was because I had been in  Africa, and knew the country.\"    \"I made hurried arrangements, packed up, said good-by to my wife,  and here I am. But to think of meeting you, Tom Swift! And to hear  that you are also going to Africa. I wish I could command an airship  for the rescue. It might be more easily accomplished!\"    \"That's just what I was going to propose!\" exclaimed Tom. \"We are  going to the land of the red pygmies, and while I have promised to  help Mr. Durban in getting ivory, and while I want to try my  electric rifle on big game, still we can do both, I think. You can  depend on us, Mr. Anderson, and if the Black Hawk can be of any  service to you in the rescue, count us in!\"    \"Gosh!\" cried the former castaway of Earthquake Island. \"This is the  best piece of luck I could have! Now tell me all about your plans.\"  which Tom and the others did, listening in turn, to further details  about the missionaries.    Just how they would go to work to effect the rescue, or how they  could locate the particular tribe of little red men who had Mr. and  Mrs. Illingway, they did not know.    \"We may be able to get hold of this Tomba,\" said Mr. Durban. \"If not  I guess between Mr. Anderson and myself we can get on the trail,  somehow. I'm anxious to get"]]]
