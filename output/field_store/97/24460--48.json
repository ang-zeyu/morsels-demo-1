With Whitman, \"I never was  possessed with a mania for killing things.\"  I had no idea of what  families they were, and I supplied my own names.  The Monarch  was the Brown Velvet; the Viceroy  was his Cousin; the Argynnis  was the Silver Spotted; and the Papilio Ajax was the Ribbon  butterfly, in my  category.  There was some thought of naming Ajax,  Dolly Varden; but on close inspection it seemed most to resemble  the gayly striped ribbons my sisters wore.    I was far afield as to names, but in later years with only a glance  at any  specimen I could say, \"Oh, yes! I always have known that.  It has buff-coloured legs, clubbed antennae with buff tips, wings  of purplish brown velvet with escalloped margins, a deep band  of buff lightly traced with black bordering them, and a pronounced  point close the apex of the front pair.  When it came to books, all  they had to teach me were the names.  I had captured and studied  butterflies, big, little, and with every conceivable variety of  marking, until it was seldom one was found whose least peculiarity  was not familiar to me as my own face; but what could this be?    It clung to the rough bark, slowly opening and closing large wings  of grey velvet down, margined with bands made of shades of grey,  tan, and black; banded with a broad stripe of red terra cotta  colour with an inside margin of white, widest on the back pair.  Both pairs of wings were decorated with half-moons of white,  outlined in black and strongly flushed with terra cotta; the  front pair near the outer margin had oval markings of blue-black,  shaded with grey, outlined with half circles of white, and  secondary circles of black.  When the wings were raised I could  see a face of terra cotta, with small eyes, a broad band of white  across the forehead, and an abdomen of terra cotta banded with  snowy white above, and spotted with white beneath.  Its legs were  hairy, and the antennae antlered like small branching ferns.  Of course I thought it was a butterfly, and for a time was too  filled with wonder to move.  Then creeping close, the next time  the wings were raised above its body, with the nerveless touch  of a robust child I captured it.    I was ten miles from home, but I had spent all my life until the  last year on that farm, and I knew and loved every foot of it.  To  leave it for a city home and the confinement of school almost had  broken my heart, but it really was time for me to be having  some formal education.  It had been the greatest possible treat to  be allowed to return to the country for a week, but now my one  idea was to go home with my treasure.  None of my people had seen  a sight like that.  If they had, they would have told me.    Borrowing a two-gallon stone jar from the tenant's wife, I searched  the garden for flowers sufficiently rare for lining.  Nothing so  pleased me as some gorgeous deep red peony  blooms.  Never having  been allowed to break the flowers when that was my mother's home,  I did not think of doing it because she was not there to know.  I knelt and gathered all the fallen petals that were fresh, and  then spreading my apron on the ground, jarred the plant, not harder  than a light wind might, and all that fell in this manner it seemed  right to take.  The selection was very pleasing, for the yellow  glaze of the jar, the rich red of the petals, and the grey  velvet of my prize made a picture over which I stood trembling in  delight.  The moth was promptly christened the Half-luna, because  my father had taught me that luna was the moon, and the half moons  on the wings were its most prominent markings.    The tenant's wife wanted me to put it in a pasteboard box, but I  stubbornly insisted on having the jar, why, I do not know, but I  suppose it was because my father's word was gospel to me, and he  had said that the best place to keep my specimens was the cellar  window, and I must have thought the jar the nearest equivalent to  the cellar.  The Half-luna did not mind in the least, but went on  lazily opening and closing its wings, yet making no attempt to fly.  If I had known what it was, or anything of its condition, I would  have understood that it had emerged from the cocoon that morning,  and never had flown, but was establishing circulation preparatory  to taking wing.  Being only a small, very ignorant girl, the  greatest thing I knew for sure was what I loved.    Tying my sunbonnet over the top of the jar, I stationed myself on  the horse block at the front gate.  Every passing team was hailed  with lifted hand, just as I had seen my father do, and in as  perfect an imitation of his voice as a scared little girl making  her first venture alone in the big world could muster, I asked,  \"Which way, Friend?\"    For several long, hot hours people went to every point of the  compass, but at last a bony young farmer, with a fat wife, and a  fatter baby, in a big wagon, were going to my city, and they said  I might ride.  With quaking heart I handed up my jar, and climbed  in, covering all those ten miles in the June sunshine, on a board  laid across e wagon bed, tightly  clasping the two-gallon jar in my  aching arms.  The farmer's wife was quite concerned about me.  She  asked if I had butter, and I said, \"Yes, the kind that flies.\"    I slipped the bonnet enough to let them peep.  She did not seem to  think much of it, but the farmer laughed until his tanned face was  red as an Indian's.  His wife insisted on me putting down the jar,  and offered to set her foot on it so that it would not 'jounce'  much, but I did not propose to risk it 'jouncing' at all, and  clung to it persistently.  Then she offered to tie her apron over  the top of the jar if I would put my bonnet on my  head, but I was  afraid to attempt the exchange for fear my  butterfly would try  to escape, and I might crush it, a thing I almost never had allowed  to happen.    The farmer's wife stuck her elbow into his ribs, and said, \"How's  that for the queerest spec'men ye ever see?\"  The farmer  answered, \"I never saw nothin' like it before.\"  Then she said,  \"Aw pshaw!  I didn't mean in the jar!\"  Then they both laughed.  I thought they were amused at me, but I had no intention of  risking an injury to my Half-luna, for there had been one black  day on which I had such a terrible experience that it entailed a  lifetime of caution.    I had captured what I afterward learned was an Asterias, that  seemed slightly different from any previous specimen, and a  yellow swallow-tail, my first Papilio Turnus.  The yellow one was  the largest, most beautiful butterfly I ever had seen.  I was  carrying them, one between each thumb and forefinger, and running  with all possible speed to reach the screen before my touch could  soil the down on their exquisite wings.  I stumbled, and fell, so  suddenly, there was no time to release them.  The black one sailed  away with a ragged wing, and the yellow was crushed into a shapeless  mass in my hand.  I was accustomed to falling off fences, from trees,  and into the creek, and because my  mother was an invalid I had  learned to doctor my own bruises and uncomplainingly go my  way.  My reputation was that of a very brave little girl;  but when I  opened my hand and saw that broken butterfly, and my down-painted  fingers, I was never more afraid in my life.  I screamed aloud in  panic, and ran for my mother with all my  might.  Heartbroken, I could  not control my voice to explain as I threw myself on her couch, and  before I knew what they  were doing, I was surrounded by sisters  and the cook with hot water, bandages and camphor.    My mother clasped me in her arms, and rocked me on her breast.  \"There, there, my poor child,\" she said, \"I know it hurts dreadfully!\"  And to the cook she commanded, \"Pour on camphor quickly!  She is  half killed, or she never would come to me like this.\"  I found  my voice.  \"Camphor won't do any  good,\" I wailed.  \"It was the most  beautiful butterfly, and I've broken it all to pieces.  It must  have taken God hours studying how to make it different from all  the others, and I know He never will forgive me!\"  I began sobbing  worse than ever.  The cook on her knees before me sat on her  heels suddenly.  \"Great Heavens!  She's screechin' about  breakin' a butterfly, and not her poor fut, at all!\"  Then I  looked down and discovered that I had stubbed my toe in falling,  and had left a bloody trail behind me.  \"Of course I am!\"  I  sobbed indignantly.  \"Couldn't I wash off a little blood in the  creek, and tie up my toe with a dock leaf and some grass?  I've  killed the most beautiful butterfly, and I know I won't be  forgiven!\"    I opened my tightly clenched hand and showed it to prove my  words.  The sight was so terrible to me that I jerked my foot from  the cook, and thrust my hand into the water, screaming, \"Wash it!  Wash it!  Wash the velvet from my hand!  Oh! make it white  again!\"  Before the cook bathed and bandaged my foot, she  washed and dried my hand; and my mother whispered, \"God knows  you never meant to do it, and He is sorry as mother is.\"  So my  mother and the cook comforted me.  The remainder scattered suddenly.  It was years before I knew why, and I was a Shakespearean student  before I caught the point to their frequently calling me 'Little Lady  Macbeth!'  After such an experience, it was not probable that I  would risk crushing a butterfly to tie a bonnet on my head.  It  probably would be down my back half the time anyway.  It usually  was.  As we neared the city I heard the farmer's wife tell him  that he must take me to my home.  He said he would not do any  such a thing, but she said he must.  She explained that she knew  me, and it would not be decent to put me down where they were  going, and leave me to walk home and carry that heavy  jar.  So  the farmer took me to our gate.  I thanked him as politely as I  knew how, and kissed his wife "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4908"],[0,"Five of Maxwell's Papers (#8)"],[1,"abstract mathematics.  If our  experimental course should help any of you to see the good of  mathematics, it will relieve us of much anxiety, for it will not only  ensure the success of your future studies, but it will make it much  less likely that they will prove injurious to your health.      But why should we labour to prove the advantage of practical science  to the University?  Let us rather speak of the help which the  University may give to science, when men well trained in mathematics  and enjoying the advantages of a well-appointed Laboratory, shall  unite their efforts to carry out some experimental research which no  solitary worker could attempt.    At first it is probable that our principal experimental work must be  the illustration of particular branches of science, but as we go on we  must add to this the study of scientific methods, the same method  being sometimes illustrated by its application to researches belonging  to different branches of science.    We might even imagine a course of experimental study the arrangement  of which should be founded on a classification of methods, and not on  that of the objects of investigation.  A combination of the two plans  seems to me better than either, and while we take every opportunity of  studying methods, we shall take care not to dissociate the method from  the scientific research to which it is applied, and to which it owes  its value.    We shall therefore arrange our lectures according to the  classification of the principal natural phenomena, such as heat,  electricity, magnetism and so on.    In the laboratory, on the other hand, the place of the different  instruments will be determined by a classification according to  methods, such as weighing and measuring, observations of time, optical  and electrical methods of observation, and so on.    The determination of the experiments to be performed at a particular  time must often depend upon the means we have at command, and in the  case of the more elaborate experiments, this may imply a long time of  preparation, during which the instruments, the methods, and the  observers themselves, are being gradually fitted for their work.  When  we have thus brought together the requisites, both material and  intellectual, for a particular experiment, it may sometimes be  desirable that before the instruments are dismounted and the observers  dispersed, we should make some other experiment, requiring the same  method, but dealing perhaps with an entirely different class of  physical phenomena.    Our principal work, however, in the Laboratory must be to acquaint  ourselves with all kinds of scientific methods, to compare them, and  to estimate their value.  It will, I think, be a result worthy of our  University, and more likely to be accomplished here than in any  private laboratory, if, by the free and full discussion of the  relative value of different scientific procedures, we succeed in  forming a school of scientific criticism, and in assisting the  development of the doctrine of method.    But admitting that a practical acquaintance with the methods of  Physical Science is an essential part of a mathematical and scientific  education, we may be asked whether we are not attributing too much  importance to science altogether as part of a liberal education.    Fortunately, there is no question here whether the University should  continue to be a place of liberal education, or should devote itself  to preparing young men for particular professions.  Hence though some  of us may, I hope, see reason to make the pursuit of science the main  business of our lives, it must be one of our most constant aims to  maintain a living connexion between our work and the other liberal  studies of Cambridge, whether literary, philological, historical or  philosophical.    There is a narrow professional spirit which may grow up among men of  science, just as it does among men who practise any other special  business.  But surely a University is the very place where we should  be able to overcome this tendency of men to become, as it were,  granulated into small worlds, which are all the more worldly for their  very smallness.  We lose the advantage of having men of varied  pursuits collected into one body, if we do not endeavour to imbibe  some of the spirit even of those whose special branch of learning is  different from our own.    It is not so long ago since any man who devoted himself to geometry,  or to any science requiring continued application, was looked upon as  necessarily a misanthrope, who must have abandoned all human  interests, and betaken himself to abstractions so far removed from the  world of life and action that he has become insensible alike to the  attractions of pleasure and to the claims of duty.    In the present day, men of science are not looked upon with the same  awe or with the same suspicion.  They are supposed to be in league  with the material spirit of the age, and to form a kind of advanced  Radical party among men of learning.    We are not here to defend literary and historical studies.  We admit  that the proper study of mankind is man.  But is the student of  science to be withdrawn from the study of man, or cut off from every  noble feeling, so long as he lives in intellectual fellowship with men  who have devoted their lives to the discovery of truth, and the  results of whose enquiries have impressed themselves on the ordinary  speech and way of thinking of men who never heard their names?  Or is  the student of history and of man to omit from his consideration the  history of the origin and diffusion of those ideas which have produced  so great a difference between one age of the world and another?    It is true that the history of science is very different from the  science of history.  We are not studying or attempting to study the  working of those blind forces which, we are told, are operating on  crowds of obscure people, shaking principalities and powers, and  compelling reasonable men to bring events to pass in an order laid  down by philosophers.    The men whose names are found in the history of science are not mere  hypothetical constituents of a crowd, to be reasoned upon only in  masses.  We recognise them as men like ourselves, and their actions  and thoughts, being more free from the influence of passion, and  recorded more accurately than those of other men, are all the better  materials for the study of the calmer parts of human nature.    But the history of science is not restricted to the enumeration of  successful investigations.  It has to tell of unsuccessful inquiries,  and to explain why some of the ablest men have failed to find the key  of knowledge, and how the reputation of others has only given a firmer  footing to the errors into which they fell.    The history of the development, whether normal or abnormal, of ideas  is of all subjects that in which we, as thinking men, take the deepest  interest.  But when the action of the mind passes out of the  intellectual stage, in which truth and error are the alternatives,  into the more violently emotional states of anger and passion, malice  and envy, fury and madness; the student of science, though he is  obliged to recognise the powerful influence which these wild forces  have exercised on mankind, is perhaps in some measure disqualified  from pursuing the study of this part of human nature.    But then how few of us are capable of deriving profit from such  studies.  We cannot enter into full sympathy with these lower phases  of our nature without losing some of that antipathy to them which is  our surest safeguard against a reversion to a meaner type, and we  gladly return to the company of those illustrious men who by aspiring  to noble ends, whether intellectual or practical, have risen above the  region of storms into a clearer atmosphere, where there is no  misrepresentation of opinion, nor ambiguity of expression, but where  one mind comes into closest contact with another at the point where  both approach nearest to the truth.      I propose to lecture during this term on Heat, and, as our facilities  for experimental work are not yet fully developed, I shall endeavour  to place before you the relative position and scientific connexion of  the different branches of the science, rather than to discuss the  details of experimental methods.    We shall begin with Thermometry, or the registration of temperatures,  and Calorimetry, or the measurement of quantities of heat.  We shall  then go on to Thermodynamics, which investigates the relations between  the thermal properties of bodies and their other dynamical properties,  in so far as these relations may be traced without any assumption as  to the particular constitution of these bodies.    The principles of Thermodynamics throw great light on all the  phenomena of nature, and it is probable that many valuable  applications of these principles have yet to be made; but we shall  have to point out the limits of this science, and to shew that many  problems in nature, especially those in which the Dissipation of  Energy comes into play, are not capable of solution by the principles  of Thermodynamics alone, but that in order to understand them, we are  obliged to form some more definite theory of the constitution of  bodies.    Two theories of the constitution of bodies have struggled for victory  with various fortunes since the earliest ages of speculation: one is  the theory of a universal plenum, the other is that of atoms and void.    The theory of the plenum is associated with the doctrine of  mathematical continuity, and its mathematical methods are those of the  Differential Calculus, which is the appropriate expression of the  relations of continuous quantity.    The theory of atoms and void leads us to attach more importance to the  doctrines of integral numbers and definite proportions; but, in  applying dynamical principles"]]]
