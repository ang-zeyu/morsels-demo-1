But a mastery of the law, a thorough knowledge and control of the  evidence, a careful preparation for the opening and closing addresses,  and an intimate acquaintance with the panel from which the jury is to be  drawn are by no means the only elements in the preparation for a  great legal battle. One thing still remains, quite as important as the  rest--the selection of the best time and the best court for the trial.  \"A good beginning\" in a criminal case means a beginning before the right  judge, the proper jury, and at a time when that vague but important  influence known as public opinion augurs success. A clever criminal  lawyer, be he prosecutor or lawyer for the defendant, knows that all the  preparation in the world is of no account provided his case is to come  before a stupid or biased judge, or a prejudiced or obstinate jury.  Therefore, each side, in a legal battle of importance, studies, as well  as it can, the character, connections, and cast of mind of the different  judges who may be called upon to hear the case, and, like a jockey  at the flag, tries to hurry or delay, as the case may be, until the  judicial auspices appear most favorable. A lawyer who has a weak defence  seeks to bring the case before a weak judge, or, if public clamor is  loud against his client, makes use of every technical artifice to secure  delay, by claiming that there are flaws in the indictment, or by moving  for commissions to take testimony in distant points of the country.  The opportunities for legal procrastination are so numerous that in a  complicated case the defence may often delay matters for over a year.  This may be an important factor in the final result.    Yet even this is not enough, for, ultimately, it is the judge's charge  to the jury which is going to guide their deliberations and, in  large measure, determine their verdict. The lawyers for the defence,  therefore, prepare long statements of what they either believe or  pretend to believe to be the law. These statements embrace all the legal  propositions, good or bad, favorable to their side of the case. If  they can induce the judge to follow these so much the better for their  client, for even if they are not law it makes no difference, since the  State has no appeal from an acquittal in a criminal case, no matter how  much the judge has erred. In the same way, but not in quite the same  fashion, the district attorney prepares \"requests to charge,\" but his  desire for favorable instructions should be, and generally is, curbed by  the consideration that if the judge makes any mistake in the law and the  defendant is convicted he can appeal and upset the case. Of course, some  prosecutors are so anxious to convict that they will wheedle or deceive  a judge into giving charges which are not only most inimical to the  prisoner, but so utterly unsound that a reversal is sure to follow; but  when one of these professional bloodhounds is baying upon the trail all  he thinks of is a conviction--that is all he wants, all the public  will remember; to him will be the glory; and when the case is finally  reversed he will probably be out of office. These \"requests\" cover  pages, and touch upon every phase of law applicable or inapplicable to  the case. Frequently they number as many as fifty, sometimes many more.  It is \"up to\" the judge to decide \"off the bat\" which are right and  which are wrong. If he guesses that the right one is wrong or the wrong  one right the defendant gets a new trial.          CHAPTER III. Sensationalism and Jury Trials      For the past twenty-five years we have heard the cry upon all sides  that the jury system is a failure, and to this general indictment is  frequently added the specification that the trials in our higher  courts of criminal justice are the scenes of grotesque buffoonery and  merriment, where cynical juries recklessly disregard their oaths and  where morbid crowds flock to satisfy the cravings of their imaginations  for details of blood and sexuality.    It is unnecessary to question the honesty of those who thus picture the  administration of criminal justice in America. Indeed, thus it probably  appears to them. But before such an arraignment of present conditions  in a highly civilized and progressive nation is accepted as final, it is  well to examine into its inherent probabilities and test it by what we  know of the actual facts.    In the first place, it should be remembered that the jury was instituted  and designed to protect the English freeman from tyranny upon the part  of the crown. Judges were, and sometimes still are, the creatures of a  ruler or unduly subject to his influence. And that ruler neither was,  nor is, always the head of the nation; but just as in the days of the  Normans he might have been a powerful earl whose influence could make or  unmake a judge, so to-day he may be none the less a ruler if he exists  in the person of a political boss who has created the judge before whom  his political enemy is to be tried. The writer has seen more than one  judge openly striving to influence a jury to convict or to acquit a  prisoner at the dictation of such a boss, who, not content to issue his  commands from behind the arras, came to the courtroom and ascended  the bench to see that they were obeyed. Usually the jury indignantly  resented such interference and administered a well-merited rebuke by  acting directly contrary to the clearly indicated wishes of the judge.    But while admitting its theoretic value as a bulwark of liberty,  the modern assailant of the jury brushes the consideration aside by  asserting that the system has \"broken down\" and \"degenerated into a  farce.\"    Let us now see how much of a farce it is. If four times out of five  a judge rendered decisions that met with general approval, he would  probably be accounted a highly satisfactory judge. Now, out of every  one hundred indicted prisoners brought to the bar for trial, probably  fifteen ought to be acquitted if prosecuted impartially and in  accordance with the strict rules of evidence. In the year 1910 the  juries of New York County convicted in sixty-six per cent of the cases  before them. If we are to test fairly the efficiency of the system,  we must deduct from the thirty-four acquittals remaining the fifteen  acquittals which were justifiable. By so doing we shall find that in  the year 1910 the New York County juries did the correct thing in about  eighty-one cases out of every hundred. This is a high percentage of  efficiency.* Is it likely that any judge would have done much better?           * The following table gives the yearly percentages of       convictions and acquittals by verdict in New York County since       1901:                    NUMBER        NUMBER       YEAR     CONVICTIONS   ACQUITTALS  CONVICTIONS   ACQUITTALS                 BY VERDICT   BY VERDICT   PER CENT      PER CENT         1901........551...........344..........62............38       1902........419...........349..........55............45       1903........485...........307..........61............39       1904........495...........357..........58............42       1905........489...........299..........62............38       1906........464...........246..........65............35       1907........582...........264..........68............32       1908........649...........301..........62............38       1909........463...........235..........66............34       1910........649...........325..........66............34      After a rather long experience as a prosecutor, in which he conducted  many hundreds of criminal cases, the writer believes that the ordinary  New York City jury finds a correct general verdict four times out of  five. As to talesmen in other localities he has no knowledge or reliable  information. It seems hardly possible, however, that juries in  other parts of the United States could be more heterogeneous or less  intelligent than those before which he formed his conclusions. Of  course, jury judgments are sometimes flagrantly wrong. But there are  many verdicts popularly regarded as examples of lawlessness which, if  examined calmly and solely from the point of view of the evidence, would  be found to be the reasonable acts of honest and intelligent juries.    For example, the acquittal of Thaw upon the ground of insanity is  usually spoken of as an illustration of sentimentality on the part of  jurymen, and of their willingness to be swayed by their emotions where  a woman is involved. But few clearer cases of insanity have been  established in a court of justice. The district attorney's own experts  had pronounced the defendant a hopeless paranoiac; the prosecutor had,  at a previous trial, openly declared the same to be his own opinion; and  the evidence was convincing. At the time it was rendered, the verdict  was accepted as a foregone conclusion. To-day the case is commonly  cited as proof of the gullibility of juries and of the impossibility of  convicting a rich man of a crime.    There will always be some persons who think that every defendant should  be convicted and feel aggrieved if he is turned out by the jury. Yet  they entirely forget, in their displeasure at the acquittal of a man  whom they instinctively \"know\" to be guilty, that the jury probably  had exactly the same impression, but were obliged under their oaths to  acquit because of an insufficiency of evidence.    An excellent illustration of such a case is that of Nan Patterson. She  is commonly supposed to have attended, upon the night of her acquittal,  a banquet at which one of her lawyers toasted her as \"the guilty girl  who beat the case.\" Whether she was guilty or not, there is a general  impression that she murdered Caesar Young. Yet the writer, who was  present throughout the trial, felt at the conclusion of the case that  there was a fairly reasonable doubt of her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52819"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 2 of 2) (#8)"],[1," \"on intimate terms\" with Lambdin. This statement  in many forms has been very often republished since, and between 1834  and 1876, the year of Rigdon's death. During these forty-two years  Rigdon never recorded a denial. That fact may, therefore, be taken as  true. If Rigdon was on terms of intimacy with Lambdin, and Lambdin,  at the time of that intimacy, as is clearly established and undenied,  was connected with Patterson in the publishing business, Rigdon, being  intimate with him, must have known something of Patterson's business,  and assuming his mental faculties unimpaired, he, in the statement  under consideration, must have told what he knew was untrue, justifying  himself by the apparent evidence in his favor that Patterson's printing  office was not run in his own name.    [Footnote 74: p. 289]    Rigdon's third matter of denial relates to his own admission of a  connection with Patterson's printing establishment. This denial we must  accept as true, since no one to whom he is alleged to have made the  admission has ever recorded his evidence, and the hearsay statements  without certainty of origin are too indefinite to be entitled to weight.    This paragraph above quoted and thus analyzed absolutely denies nothing  in the remotest degree essential to the real issues involved in the  charge of plagiarism under investigation, and is absolutely the only  recorded public denial ever made by Rigdon, though from 1834 to 1876  he was almost continually under the fire of this charge, reiterated in  various forms and with varying proofs.    RIGDON AND LAMBDIN IN 1815.    Heretofore we have argued that by his silence Rigdon admitted his  intimacy with Lambdin, successively Patterson's employee and partner  from 1812 to 1823. The early writers all treated the intimacy between  Rigdon and Lambdin as a matter apparently too well known to need proof.  Yet we need not rely upon that, nor even Rigdon's failure to deny,  since more definite evidence has been preserved.    Mrs. R. J. Eichbaum, under date of Pittsburg, September 18, 1879,  leaves us this very convincing statement:        \"My father, John Johnston, was postmaster at Pittsburg for about      eighteen years, from 1804 to 1822. My husband, William Eichbaumn,      succeeded him, and was postmaster for about eleven years, from 1822      to 1833. I was born August 25, 1792, and when I became old enough      I assisted my father in attending to the post office, and became      familiar with his duties. From 1811 to 1816 I was the regular      clerk in the office, assorting, making up, dispatching, opening,      and distributing the mails. Pittsburg was then a small town, and I      was well acquainted with all the stated visitors at the office who      called regularly for their mails. So meager at that time were the      mails that I could generally tell without looking whether or not      there was anything for such persons, though I would usually look      in order to satisfy them. I was married in 1815, and the next year      my connection with the office ceased, except during the absences      of my husband. I knew and distinctly remember Robert and Joseph      Patterson, J. Harrison Lambdin, Silas Engles, and Sidney Rigdon.      I remember Rev. Mr. Spaulding, but simply as one who occasionally      called to inquire for letters. I remember there was an evident      intimacy between Lambdin and Rigdon. They very often came to the      office together. I particularly remember that they would thus come      during the hour on Sabbath afternoon when the office was required      to be open, and I remember feeling sure that Rev. Mr. Patterson      knew nothing of this, or he would have put a stop to it. I do not      know what position, if any, Rigdon filled in Patterson's store or      printing office, but am well assured he was frequently, if not      constantly, there for a large part of the time when I was clerk in      the post office. I recall Mr. Engles saying that 'Rigdon was always      hanging around the printing office.' He was connected with the      tannery before he became a preacher, though he may have continued      the business whilst preaching.\" [75]    [Footnote 75: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 10-11.]    While this does not establish that Sidney Rigdon had a permanent abode  in Pittsburg, nor that he was connected with Patterson's printing  establishment, it yet explains why seemingly everybody who knew  him reached that conclusion. It also establishes beyond doubt his  undeniable intimacy with Lambdin and Engles, and by reason thereof, his  possible access to Spaulding's manuscript, and doubtless is one of the  circumstances leading Spaulding to suspect Rigdon of the theft.    RIGDON EXHIBITS SPAULDING'S MANUSCRIPT.    It will be remembered that in 1822-3 Rigdon was a Baptist preacher  in Pittsburg. The Rev. John Winter, M.D., one of the western  Pennsylvania's early preachers, was then (1822-3) a school teacher in  Pittsburg. Dr. Winter died at Sharon, Pa., in 1878.    On one occasion during this period (1822-3) Dr. Winter was in Rigdon's  study when the latter took from his desk a large manuscript, and said,  substantially, that a Presbyterian minister named Spaulding, whose  health had failed, brought it to a printer to see if it would pay to  publish it. \"It is a romance of the Bible.\" Dr. Winter did not read the  manuscript, nor think any more of the matter until the Book of Mormon  appeared. It was thought by members of Dr. Winter's family that he had  committed his recollections of this interview to writing, but none  could be found.    The authorities of Dr. Winter's statement are Rev. A. G. Kirk, to whom  Dr. Winter communicated it in a conversation had at New Brighton, Pa.,  in 1870-1. The second authority is the Rev. A. J. Bonsall, a stepson of  Dr. Winter, and for twenty-three years pastor of the Baptist Church at  Rochester, Pa. To him the same story was often repeated by Dr. Winter.  The third authority is Mrs. W. Irvine, a daughter of Dr. Winter, in  1881 resident at Sharon, Pa. Her statement has one or two details not  already given, so I quote:        \"I have frequently heard my father speak of Rigdon having      Spaulding's manuscript, and that he had gotten it from the printers      to read it as a curiosity; as such he showed it to father; and that      at the time Rigdon had no intention of making the use of it that he      afterwards did.\" [76]    [Footnote 76: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 11-12. \"Braden-Kelly  Debate,\" 42.]    Thus authenticated, Dr. Winter's statement may be given as much weight  as though reduced to writing by himself.    RIGDON FOREKNOWS THE COMING AND CONTENTS OF THE BOOK OF MORMON.    The Rev. Adamson Bentley (whose wife was sister to Mrs. Sidney Rigdon)  wrote the following to Walter Scott under date of January 22, 1841:        \"I know that Sidney Rigdon told me that there was a book coming      out, the manuscript of which had been found engraved on gold      plates, as much as two years before the Mormon book made its      appearance or had been heard of by me.\"    This statement was published in the _Millennial Harbinger_ for 1844,  with the following editorial note from Rev. Alexander Campbell:        \"The conversation alluded to in Brother Bentley's letter of 1841      was in my presence as well as his, and my recollection of it led      me, some two or three years ago, to interrogate Brother Bentley      touching his recollection of it, which accorded with mine in every      particular, except the year in which it occurred, he placing it in      the summer of 1827, I in the summer of 1826, Rigdon at the same      time observing that in the plates dug up in New York there was an      account, not only of the aborigines of this country, but also it      was stated that the Christian religion had been preached in this      country during the first century, just as we were preaching it in      the Western Reserve.\" [77]    [Footnote 77: Besides _Millennial Harbinger_ 1844, p. 39, see \"Who  Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 12 and 13. \"Braden-Kelly Debate,\" 45.]    It will be remembered that Rigdon lived for a time at his  brother-in-law Bentley's house, and that it was Scott, Campbell, and  Rigdon who, in Pittsburg, organized the Disciple Church in 1824 or  1825. The above statements were published in the _Millennial Harbinger_  in 1844 (p. 39), twenty-two years before Rigdon's death, yet he never  published a denial to either. It seems that before that publication  Adamson Bentley was orally making statements, probably to the same  effect, which remained undenied by Rigdon, though he published a card  denouncing his brother-in-law. [78]    [Footnote 78: _Evening and Morning Star,_ 301.]    Mrs. Amos Dunlap, a niece of Mrs. Rigdon, under date of Warren, O.,  December 7, 1879, writes this:        \"When I was quite a child I visited Mr. Rigdon's family. He married      my aunt. They at that time lived at Bainbridge, O. [1826-7]. During      my visit Mr. Rigdon went to his bedroom and took from a trunk which      he kept locked, a certain manuscript. He came out into the other      room and seated himself by the fireplace and commenced reading it.      His wife at that moment came into the room and exclaimed: 'What,      are you studying that thing again?' or something to that effect.      She then added: 'I mean to burn that paper.' He said, 'No indeed,      you will not; this will be a great thing some day.' Whenever he was      reading this he was so completely occupied that he seemed entirely      unconscious of anything passing around him.\" [79]    [Footnote 79: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 12. \"Braden-Kelly  Debate,\" 45.]    Since Rigdon never, in person or by anyone else, has claimed to  have written any such manuscript of his own, in the light of other  evidence here adduced, we are warranted in believing that to have been  Spaulding's \"Manuscript Found.\"    The Rev. D. Atwater, "]]]
