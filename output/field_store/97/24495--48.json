Carry that basket for me and  help yourself to its contents if you are hungry.\"    Tip seized the basket eagerly and began to eat, following for a time the  strange girl without bothering to ask questions. She walked along before him  with swift strides, and there was about her an air of decision and  importance that led him to suspect she was some great personage.    Finally, when he had satisfied his hunger, he ran up beside her and tried to  keep pace with her swift footsteps--a very difficult feat, for she was  much taller than he, and evidently in a hurry.    \"Thank you very much for the sandwiches,\" said Tip, as he trotted along.  \"May I ask your name?\"        86    \"I am General Jinjur,\" was the brief reply.    \"Oh!\" said the boy surprised. \"What sort of a General?\"    \"I command the Army of Revolt in this war,\" answered the General, with  unnecessary sharpness.    \"Oh!\" he again exclaimed. \"I didn't know there was a war.\"    \"You were not supposed to know it,\" she returned, \"for we have kept it a  secret; and considering that our army is composed entirely of girls,\" she  added, with some pride, \"it is surely a remarkable thing that our Revolt is  not yet discovered.\"    \"It is, indeed,\" acknowledged Tip. \"But where is your army?\"    \"About a mile from here,\" said General Jinjur. \"The forces have assembled  from all parts of the Land of Oz, at my express command. For this is the day  we are to conquer His Majesty the Scarecrow, and wrest from him the throne.  The Army of Revolt only awaits my coming to march upon the Emerald City.\"    \"Well!\" declared Tip, drawing a long breath, \"this is certainly a surprising  thing! May I ask why you wish to conquer His Majesty the Scarecrow?\"    \"Because the Emerald City has been ruled by men long enough, for one  reason,\" said the girl.        87  \"Moreover, the City glitters with beautiful gems, which might far better be  used for rings, bracelets and necklaces; and there is enough money in the  King's treasury to buy every girl in our Army a dozen new gowns. So we  intend to conquer the City and run the government to suit ourselves.\"    Jinjur spoke these words with an eagerness and decision that proved she was  in earnest.    \"But war is a terrible thing,\" said Tip, thoughtfully.    \"This war will be pleasant,\" replied the girl, cheerfully.    \"Many of you will be slain!\" continued the boy, in an awed voice.    \"Oh, no\", said Jinjur. \"What man would oppose a girl, or dare to harm her?  And there is not an ugly face in my entire Army.\"    Tip laughed.    \"Perhaps you are right,\" said he. \"But the Guardian of the Gate is  considered a faithful Guardian, and the King's Army will not let the City be  conquered without a struggle.\"    \"The Army is old and feeble,\" replied General Jinjur, scornfully. \"His  strength has all been used to grow whiskers, and his wife has such a temper  that she has already pulled more than half of them        88  out by the roots. When the Wonderful Wizard reigned the Soldier with the  Green Whiskers was a very good Royal Army, for people feared the Wizard. But  no one is afraid of the Scarecrow, so his Royal Army don't count for much in  time of war.\"    After this conversation they proceeded some distance in silence, and before  long reached a large clearing in the forest where fully four hundred young  women were assembled. These were laughing and talking together as gaily as  if they had gathered for a picnic instead of a war of conquest.    They were divided into four companies, and Tip noticed that all were dressed  in costumes similar to that worn by General Jinjur. The only real difference  was that while those girls from the Munchkin country had the blue strip in  front of their skirts, those from the country of the Quadlings had the red  strip in front; and those from the country of the Winkies had the yellow  strip in front, and the Gillikin girls wore the purple strip in front. All  had green waists, representing the Emerald City they intended to conquer,  and the top button on each waist indicated by its color which country the  wearer came from. The uniforms were Jaunty and becoming, and quite effective  when massed together.    Tip thought this strange Army bore no weapons        89  whatever; but in this he was wrong. For each girl had stuck through the knot  of her back hair two long, glittering knitting-needles.    General Jinjur immediately mounted the stump of a tree and addressed her  army.    \"Friends, fellow-citizens, and girls!\" she said; \"we are about to begin our  great Revolt against the men of Oz! We march to conquer the Emerald City--to  dethrone the Scarecrow King--to acquire thousands of gorgeous gems--to  rifle the royal treasury--and to obtain power over our former  oppressors!\"    \"Hurrah!\" said those who had listened; but Tip thought most of the Army was  too much engaged in chattering to pay attention to the words of the General.    The command to march was now given, and the girls formed themselves into  four bands, or companies, and set off with eager strides toward the Emerald  City.

It was  not long before they came to the green granite walls of the City and halted  before the gateway.        91    The Guardian of the Gate at once came out and looked at them curiously, as  if a circus had come to town. He carried a bunch of keys swung round his  neck by a golden chain; his hands were thrust carelessly into his pockets,  and he seemed to have no idea at all that the City was threatened by rebels.  Speaking pleasantly to the girls, he said:    \"Good morning, my dears! What can I do for you?\"                     Line-Art Drawing        \"Surrender instantly!\" answered General Jinjur, standing before him and  frowning as terribly as her pretty face would allow her to.    \"Surrender!\" echoed the man, astounded. \"Why, it's impossible. It's against  the law! I never heard of such a thing in my life.\"        92    \"Still, you must surrender!\" exclaimed the General, fiercely. \"We are  revolting!\"    \"You don't look it,\" said the Guardian, gazing from one to another,  admiringly.    \"But we are!\" cried Jinjur, stamping her foot, impatiently; \"and we mean to  conquer the Emerald City!\"    \"Good gracious!\" returned the surprised Guardian of the Gates; \"what a  nonsensical idea! Go home to your mothers, my good girls, and milk the cows  and bake the bread. Don't you know it's a dangerous thing to conquer a  city?\"    \"We are not afraid!\" responded the General; and she looked so determined  that it made the Guardian uneasy.    So he rang the bell for the Soldier with the Green Whiskers, and the next  minute was sorry he had done so. For immediately he was surrounded by a  crowd of girls who drew the knitting-needles from their hair and began  Jabbing them at the Guardian with the sharp points dangerously near his fat  cheeks and blinking eyes.    The poor man howled loudly for mercy and made no resistance when Jinjur drew  the bunch of keys from around his neck.    Followed by her Army the General now rushed        93               Full page line-art drawing.                   GENERAL JINJUR AND HER ARMY CAPTURE THE CITY.        94  to the gateway, where she was confronted by the Royal Army of Oz--which  was the other name for the Soldier with the Green Whiskers.    \"Halt!\" he cried, and pointed his long gun full in the face of the leader.    Some of the girls screamed and ran back, but General Jinjur bravely stood  her ground and said, reproachfully:    \"Why, how now? Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?\"    \"No,\" replied the soldier, \"for my gun isn't loaded.\"    \"Not loaded?\"    \"No; for fear of accidents. And I've forgotten where I hid the powder and  shot to load it with. But if you'll wait a short time I'll try to hunt them  up.\"    \"Don't trouble yourself,\" said Jinjur, cheerfully. Then she turned to her  Army and cried:    \"Girls, the gun isn't loaded!\"    \"Hooray,\" shrieked the rebels, delighted at this good news, and they  proceeded to rush upon the Soldier with the Green Whiskers in such a crowd  that it was a wonder they didn't stick the knitting-needles into one  another.    But the Royal Army of Oz was too much afraid        95  of women to meet the onslaught. He simply turned about and ran with all his  might through the gate and toward the royal palace, while General Jinjur and  her mob flocked into the unprotected City.    In this way was the Emerald City captured without a drop of blood being  spilled. The Army of Revolt had become an Army of Conquerors!

The invading army entered the City more slowly, for they  stopped to dig emeralds out of the walls and paving-stones with the points  of their knitting-needles. So the Soldier and the boy reached the palace  before the news had spread that the City was conquered.    The Scarecrow and Jack Pumpkinhead were still playing at quoits in the  courtyard when the game was interrupted by the abrupt entrance of the Royal  Army of Oz, who came flying in without his hat or gun, his clothes in sad  disarray and his long beard floating a yard behind him as he ran.        98    \"Tally one for me,\" said the Scarecrow, calmly \"What's wrong, my man?\" he  added, addressing the Soldier.    \"Oh! your Majesty--your Majesty! The City is conquered!\" gasped the Royal  Army, who was all out of breath.    \"This is quite sudden,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But please go and bar all the  doors and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402"],[0,"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (#8)"],[1," ACADEMY.
