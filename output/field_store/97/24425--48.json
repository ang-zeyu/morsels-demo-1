I can't spur my horse or beat him. Oh, I  HATE pain!\"    \"You're a strange girl to live out here on this border,\" he said.    \"I'm no different from other girls. You don't know girls.\"    \"I knew one pretty well. She put a rope round my neck,\" he replied,  grimly.    \"A rope!\"    \"Yes, I mean a halter, a hangman's noose. But I balked her!\"    \"Oh!... A good girl?\"    \"Bad! Bad to the core of her black heart--bad as I am!\" he exclaimed,  with fierce, low passion.    Joan trembled. The man, in an instant, seemed transformed, somber as  death. She could not look at him, but she must keep on talking.    \"Bad? You don't seem bad to me--only violent, perhaps, or wild.... Tell  me about yourself.\"    She had stirred him. His neglected pipe fell from his hand. In the gloom  of the camp-fire he must have seen faces or ghosts of his past.    \"Why not?\" he queried, strangely. \"Why not do what's been impossible for  years--open my lips? It'll not matter--to a girl who can never tell!...  Have I forgotten? God!--I have not! Listen, so that you'll KNOW I'm bad.  My name's not Kells. I was born in the East, and went to school there  till I ran away. I was young, ambitious, wild. I stole. I ran away--came  West in 'fifty-one to the gold-fields in California. There I became a  prospector, miner, gambler, robber--and road-agent. I had evil in me, as  all men have, and those wild years brought it out. I had no chance. Evil  and gold and blood--they are one and the same thing. I committed every  crime till no place, bad as it might be, was safe for me. Driven and  hunted and shot and starved--almost hanged!... And now I'm--Kells! of  that outcast crew you named 'the Border Legion!' Every black crime but  one--the blackest--and that haunting me, itching my hands to-night.\"    \"Oh, you speak so--so dreadfully!\" cried Joan. \"What can I say? I'm  sorry for you. I don't believe it all. What--what black crime haunts  you? Oh! what could be possible tonight--here in this lonely canon--with  only me?\"    Dark and terrible the man arose.    \"Girl,\" he said, hoarsely. \"To-night--to-night--I'll.... What have you  done to me? One more day--and I'll be mad to do right by you--instead of  WRONG.... Do you understand that?\"    Joan leaned forward in the camp-fire light with outstretched hands  and quivering lips, as overcome by his halting confession of one last  remnant of honor as she was by the dark hint of his passion.    \"No--no--I don't understand--nor believe!\" she cried. \"But you frighten  me--so! I am all--all alone with you here. You said I'd be safe.  Don't--don't--\"    Her voice broke then and she sank back exhausted in her seat. Probably  Kells had heard only the first words of her appeal, for he took to  striding back and forth in the circle of the camp-fire light. The  scabbard with the big gun swung against his leg. It grew to be a dark  and monstrous thing in Joan's sight. A marvelous intuition born of that  hour warned her of Kells's subjection to the beast in him, even while,  with all the manhood left to him, he still battled against it. Her  girlish sweetness and innocence had availed nothing, except mock him  with the ghost of dead memories. He could not be won or foiled. She must  get her hands on that gun--kill him--or--! The alternative was death for  herself. And she leaned there, slowly gathering all the unconquerable  and unquenchable forces of a woman's nature, waiting, to make one  desperate, supreme, and final effort.          5    Kells strode there, a black, silent shadow, plodding with bent head, as  if all about and above him were demons and furies.    Joan's perceptions of him, of the night, of the inanimate and  imponderable black walls, and of herself, were exquisitely and  abnormally keen. She saw him there, bowed under his burden, gloomy and  wroth and sick with himself because the man in him despised the coward.  Men of his stamp were seldom or never cowards. Their lives did not breed  cowardice or baseness. Joan knew the burning in her breast--that thing  which inflamed and swept through her like a wind of fire--was hate. Yet  her heart held a grain of pity for him. She measured his forbearance,  his struggle, against the monstrous cruelty and passion engendered by  a wild life among wild men at a wild time. And, considering his  opportunities of the long hours and lonely miles, she was grateful, and  did not in the least underestimate what it cost him, how different from  Bill or Halloway he had been. But all this was nothing, and her thinking  of it useless, unless he conquered himself. She only waited, holding on  to that steel-like control of her nerves, motionless and silent.    She leaned back against her saddle, a blanket covering her, with  wide-open eyes, and despite the presence of that stalking figure and the  fact of her mind being locked round one terrible and inevitable thought,  she saw the changing beautiful glow of the fire-logs and the cold,  pitiless stars and the mustering shadows under the walls. She heard,  too, the low rising sigh of the wind in the balsam and the silvery  tinkle of the brook, and sounds only imagined or nameless. Yet a stern  and insupportable silence weighed her down. This dark canon seemed  at the ends of the earth. She felt encompassed by illimitable and  stupendous upflung mountains, insulated in a vast, dark, silent tomb.    Kells suddenly came to her, treading noiselessly, and he leaned over  her. His visage was a dark blur, but the posture of him was that of a  wolf about to spring. Lower he leaned--slowly--and yet lower. Joan  saw the heavy gun swing away from his leg; she saw it black and clear  against the blaze; a cold, blue light glinted from its handle. And then  Kells was near enough for her to see his face and his eyes that were but  shadows of flames. She gazed up at him steadily, open-eyed, with no fear  or shrinking. His breathing was quick and loud. He looked down at her  for an endless moment, then, straightening his bent form, he resumed his  walk to and fro.    After that for Joan time might have consisted of moments or hours, each  of which was marked by Kells looming over her. He appeared to approach  her from all sides; he round her wide-eyed, sleepless; his shadowy  glance gloated over her lithe, slender shape; and then he strode away  into the gloom. Sometimes she could no longer hear his steps and then  she was quiveringly alert, listening, fearful that he might creep upon  her like a panther. At times he kept the camp-fire blazing brightly; at  others he let it die down. And these dark intervals were frightful  for her. The night seemed treacherous, in league with her foe. It was  endless. She prayed for dawn--yet with a blank hopelessness for what  the day might bring. Could she hold out through more interminable hours?  Would she not break from sheer strain? There were moments when she  wavered and shook like a leaf in the wind, when the beating of her heart  was audible, when a child could have seen her distress. There were  other moments when all was ugly, unreal, impossible like things in a  nightmare. But when Kells was near or approached to look at her, like  a cat returned to watch a captive mouse, she was again strong, waiting,  with ever a strange and cold sense of the nearness of that swinging gun.  Late in the night she missed him, for how long she had no idea. She had  less trust in his absence than his presence. The nearer he came to her  the stronger she grew and the clearer of purpose. At last the black void  of canon lost its blackness and turned to gray. Dawn was at hand. The  horrible endless night, in which she had aged from girl to woman, had  passed. Joan had never closed her eyes a single instant.    When day broke she got up. The long hours in which she had rested  motionlessly had left her muscles cramped and dead. She began to walk  off the feeling. Kells had just stirred from his blanket under the  balsam-tree. His face was dark, haggard, lined. She saw him go down to  the brook and plunge his hands into the water and bathe his face with a  kind of fury. Then he went up to the smoldering fire. There was a gloom,  a somberness, a hardness about him that had not been noticeable the day  before.    Joan found the water cold as ice, soothing to the burn beneath her skin.  She walked away then, aware that Kells did not appear to care, and went  up to where the brook brawled from under the cliff. This was a hundred  paces from camp, though in plain sight. Joan looked round for her  horse, but he was not to be seen. She decided to slip away the first  opportunity that offered, and on foot or horseback, any way, to get out  of Kells's clutches if she had to wander, lost in the mountains, till  she starved. Possibly the day might be endurable, but another night  would drive her crazy. She sat on a ledge, planning and brooding, till  she was startled by a call from Kells. Then slowly she retraced her  steps.    \"Don't you want to eat?\" he asked.    \"I'm not hungry,\" she replied.    \"Well, eat anyhow--if it chokes you,\" he ordered.    Joan seated herself while he placed food and drink before her. She did  not look at him and did not feel his gaze upon her. Far asunder as they  had been yesterday the distance between them to-day was incalculably  greater. She ate as much as she could swallow and pushed the rest  away. Leaving the camp-fire, she began walking again, here and there,  aimlessly, scarcely seeing what she looked at. There was a shadow over  her, an impending portent of catastrophe, a moment standing dark and  sharp out of the age-long hour. She leaned against the balsam and then  she rested in the stone seat, and then she had to walk again. It might  have been long, that time; she never knew how long or short. There came  a strange flagging, sinking of her spirit, accompanied by vibrating,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45532"],[0,"History of Julius Cæsar, Vol. 2 of 2 (#8)"],[1,"es.[131] In Aquitaine, these followers were named  _soldures_; they shared the good as well as the evil fortune of the  chief to whom they were attached, and, when he died, not one of them  would survive him. Their number was considerable: we shall see a king of  the Sotiates possess no less than six hundred of them.[132]    The states were governed either by an assembly, which the Romans called  a senate, or by a supreme magistrate, annual or for life, bearing the  title of king,[133] prince,[134] or _vergobret_.[135]    The different tribes formed alliances among themselves, either permanent  or occasional; the permanent alliances were founded, some on a community  of territorial interests,[136] others on affinities of races,[137] or on  treaties,[138] or, lastly, on the right of patronage.[139] The  occasional alliances were the results of the necessity of union against  a common danger.[140]    In Gaul, not only each state and each tribe (_pagus_), but even each  family, was divided into two parties (_factiones_); at the head of these  parties were chiefs, taken from among the most considerable and  influential of the knights. Caesar calls them _principes_.[141] All those  who accepted their supremacy became their clients; and, although the  _principes_ did not exercise a regular magistracy, their authority was  very extensive. This organisation had existed from a remote antiquity;  its object was to offer to each man of the people a protection against  the great, since each was thus placed under the patronage of a chief,  whose duty it was to take his cause in hand, and who would have lost all  credit if he had allowed one of his clients to be oppressed.[142] We see  in the \"Commentaries\" that this class of the _principes_ enjoyed very  great influence. On their decisions depended all important  resolutions;[143] and their meeting formed the assembly of the whole of  Gaul (_concilium totius Galliae_).[144] In it everything was decided by  majority of votes.[145]    Affairs of the state were allowed to be treated only in these  assemblies. It appertained to the magistrates alone to publish or  conceal events, according as they judged expedient; and it was a sacred  duty for any one who learnt, either from without or from public rumour,  any news which concerned the _civitas_, to give information of it to the  magistrate, without revealing it to any other person. This measure had  for its object to prevent rash or ignorant men from being led into error  by false reports, and from rushing, under this first impression, into  extravagant resolutions.    In the same manner as each state was divided into two rival factions, so  was the whole of Gaul (with the exception of Belgic Gaul and Helvetia)  divided into two great parties,[146] which exercised over the others a  sort of sovereignty (_principatus_);[147] and when, in extraordinary  circumstances, the whole of Gaul acknowledged the pre-eminence of one  particular state, the chief of the privileged state took the name of  _princeps totius Galliae_, as had been the case with the Arvernan  Celtillus, the father of Vercingetorix.[148]    This supremacy, nevertheless, was not permanent; it passed from one  nation to another, and was the object of continual ambitions and  sanguinary conflicts. The Druids, it is true, had succeeded in  establishing a religious centre, but there existed no political centre.  In spite of certain federative ties, each state had been more engaged in  the consideration of its own individuality than in that of the country  in general. This egoistic carelessness of their collective interests,  this jealous rivality among the different tribes, paralysed the efforts  of a few eminent men who were desirous of founding a nationality, and  the Gauls soon furnished the enemy with an easy means of dividing and  combating them. The Emperor Napoleon I. was thus right in saying: \"The  principal cause of the weakness of Gaul was the spirit of isolation and  locality which characterised the population; at this epoch the Gauls had  no national spirit or even provincial spirit; they were governed by a  spirit of town. It is the same spirit which has since forged chains for  Italy. Nothing is more opposed to national spirit, to general ideas of  liberty, than the particular spirit of family or of town. From this  parcelling it resulted that the Gauls had no army of the line kept up  and exercised; and therefore no art and no military science. Every  nation which should lose sight of the importance of an army of the line  perpetually on foot, and which should trust to levies or national  armies, would experience the fate of the Gauls, without even having the  glory of opposing the same resistance, which was the effect of the  barbarism of the time and of the ground, covered with forests, marshes,  and bogs, and without roads, which rendered it difficult to conquer and  easy to defend.\"[149] Before Caesar came into Gaul, the AEdui and the  Arverni were at the head of the two contending parties, each labouring  to carry the day against his rival. Soon these latter united with the  Sequani, who, jealous of the superiority of the AEdui, the allies of the  Roman people, invoked the support of Ariovistus and the Germans. By dint  of sacrifices and promises, they had succeeded in bringing them into  their territory. With this aid the Sequani had gained the victory in  several combats.[150] The AEdui had lost their nobility, a part of their  territory, nearly all their clients, and, after giving up as hostages  their children and their chiefs, they had bound themselves by oath never  to attack the Sequani, who had at length obtained the supremacy of all  Gaul. It was under these circumstances that Divitiacus had gone to Rome  to implore the succour of the Republic, but he had failed;[151] the  Senate was too much engaged with intestine quarrels to assume an  energetic attitude towards the Germans. The arrival of Caesar was  destined to change the face of things, and restore to the allies of Rome  their old preponderance.[152]          CHAPTER III.    CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE HELVETII.    (Year of Rome 696.)    (BOOK I. OF THE \"COMMENTARIES.\")      [Sidenote: Projects of Invasion by the Helvetii.]    I. Caesar, as we have seen, had received from the Senate and people a  command which comprised the two Gauls (Transalpine and Cisalpine) and  Illyria.[153] Yet the agitation which continued to reign in the Republic  was retaining him at the gates of Rome, when suddenly, towards the  spring of 696, news came that the Helvetii, returning to their old  design, were preparing to invade the Roman province. This intelligence  caused a great sensation.    The Helvetii, proud of their former exploits, confident in their  strength, and incommoded by excess of population, felt humiliated at  living in a country the limits of which had been made narrow by nature,  and for some years they meditated quitting it to repair into the south  of Gaul.    As early as 693, an ambitious chieftain, Orgetorix, found no difficulty  in inspiring them with the desire to seek elsewhere a more fertile  territory and a milder climate. They resolved to go and establish  themselves in the country of the Santones (the _Saintonge_), situated on  the shores of the ocean, to the north of the Gironde. Two years were to  be employed in preparations, and, by a solemn engagement, the departure  was fixed for the third year. But Orgetorix, sent to the neighbouring  peoples to contract alliances, conspired with two influential  personages--one of the country of the Sequani, the other of that of the  AEdui. He induced them to undertake to seize the supreme power, promised  them the assistance of the Helvetii, and persuaded them that those three  powerful nations, leagued together, would easily subjugate the whole of  Gaul. This conspiracy failed, through the death of Orgetorix, accused in  his own country of a design to usurp the sovereignty. The Helvetii  persisted, nevertheless, in their project of emigration. They collected  the greatest possible number of wagons and beasts of burden; and, in  order to destroy all idea of returning, they burnt their twelve towns,  their four hundred hamlets, and all the wheat they could not carry with  them. Each furnished himself with meal[154] for three months; and after  persuading their neighbours, the Rauraci,[155] the Tulingi, and the  Latobriges,[156] to imitate their example and follow them, and having  drawn to them those of the Boii who had moved from Noricum to the  neighbourhood of the Rhine, they fixed the rendezvous on the banks of  the Rhone for the 5th of the Calends of April (the 24th of March, the  day of the equinox).[157]    There were only two roads by which they could leave Helvetia; one  crossed the country of the Sequani, the entrance to which was defended  by a narrow and difficult defile, situated between the Rhone and the  Jura (the _Pas-de-l'Ecluse_), and where the wagons could with difficulty  pass one at a time. As this defile was commanded by a very lofty  mountain, a handful of men was sufficient to prevent the access. The  other road, less contracted and more easy, crossed the Roman province,  after having passed the Rhone, which separated the Allobroges from the  Helvetii, from Lake Leman to the Jura. Within this distance the river  was fordable in several places.[158] At Geneva, the extreme limit of the  territory of the Allobroges towards Helvetia, a bridge established a  communication between the two countries. The Helvetii decided on taking  the most convenient road; they reckoned, moreover, on the co-operation  of this neighbouring people, who, but recently subjugated, could have  but doubtful sympathies for the Romans.[159]      [Sidenote: Caesar's Arrival at Geneva.]    II. Caesar, learning that the Helvetii intended to pass through the Roman  province, left Rome hastily in the month of March, hurried by forced  marches into"]]]
