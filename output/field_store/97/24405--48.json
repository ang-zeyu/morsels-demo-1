Instantly they all jumped from the hats, dashed out the open door  of the glass case and scampered away to their cellar. But this  action so frightened the milliner and her sister that after giving  several loud screams they fell upon their backs on the floor and  fainted away.    Popopo was a kind-hearted knook, but on witnessing all this misery,  caused by his own ignorance of the ways of humans, he straightway  wished himself at home, and so left the poor women to recover as  best they could.    Yet he could not escape a sad feeling of responsibility, and after  thinking upon the matter he decided that since he had caused the  milliner's unhappiness by freeing the birds, he could set the matter  right by restoring them to the glass case. He loved the birds, and  disliked to condemn them to slavery again; but that seemed the only  way to end the trouble.    So he set off to find the birds. They had flown a long distance, but  it was nothing to Popopo to reach them in a second, and he  discovered them sitting upon the branches of a big chestnut tree and  singing gayly.    When they saw the knook the birds cried:    \"Thank you, Popopo. Thank you for setting us free.\"    \"Do not thank me,\" returned the knook, \"for I have come to send you  back to the millinery shop.\"    \"Why?\" demanded a blue jay, angrily, while the others stopped their  songs.    \"Because I find the woman considers you her property, and your loss  has caused her much unhappiness,\" answered Popopo.    \"But remember how unhappy we were in her glass case,\" said a robin  redbreast, gravely. \"And as for being her property, you are a knook,  and the natural guardian of all birds; so you know that Nature  created us free. To be sure, wicked men shot and stuffed us, and  sold us to the milliner; but the idea of our being her property is  nonsense!\"    Popopo was puzzled.    \"If I leave you free,\" he said, \"wicked men will shoot you again,  and you will be no better off than before.\"    \"Pooh!\" exclaimed the blue jay, \"we cannot be shot now, for we are  stuffed. Indeed, two men fired several shots at us this morning, but  the bullets only ruffled our feathers and buried themselves in our  stuffing. We do not fear men now.\"    \"Listen!\" said Popopo, sternly, for he felt the birds were getting  the best of the argument; \"the poor milliner's business will be  ruined if I do not return you to her shop. It seems you are  necessary to trim the hats properly. It is the fashion for women to  wear birds upon their headgear. So the poor milliner's wares,  although beautified by lace and ribbons, are worthless unless you  are perched upon them.\"    \"Fashions,\" said a black bird, solemnly, \"are made by men. What law  is there, among birds or knooks, that requires us to be the slaves  of fashion?\"    \"What have we to do with fashions, anyway?\" screamed a linnet. \"If  it were the fashion to wear knooks perched upon women's hats would  you be contented to stay there? Answer me, Popopo!\"    But Popopo was in despair. He could not wrong the birds by sending  them back to the milliner, nor did he wish the milliner to suffer by  their loss. So he went home to think what could be done.    After much meditation he decided to consult the king of the knooks,  and going at once to his majesty he told him the whole story.    The king frowned.    \"This should teach you the folly of interfering with earth people,\"  he said. \"But since you have caused all this trouble, it is your  duty to remedy it. Our birds cannot be enslaved, that is certain;  therefore you must have the fashions changed, so it will no longer  be stylish for women to wear birds upon their hats.\"    \"How shall I do that?\" asked Popopo.    \"Easily enough. Fashions often change among the earth people, who  tire quickly of any one thing. When they read in their newspapers  and magazines that the style is so-and-so, they never question the  matter, but at once obey the mandate of fashion. So you must visit  the newspapers and magazines and enchant the types.\"    \"Enchant the types!\" echoed Popopo, in wonder.    \"Just so. Make them read that it is no longer the fashion to wear  birds upon hats. That will afford relief to your poor milliner and  at the same time set free thousands of our darling birds who have  been so cruelly used.\"    Popopo thanked the wise king and followed his advice.    The office of every newspaper and magazine in the city was visited by  the knook, and then he went to other cities, until there was not a  publication in the land that had not a \"new fashion note\" in its  pages. Sometimes Popopo enchanted the types, so that whoever read  the print would see only what the knook wished them to. Sometimes he  called upon the busy editors and befuddled their brains until they  wrote exactly what he wanted them to. Mortals seldom know how  greatly they are influenced by fairies, knooks and ryls, who often  put thoughts into their heads that only the wise little immortals  could have conceived.    The following morning when the poor milliner looked over her  newspaper she was overjoyed to read that \"no woman could now wear a  bird upon her hat and be in style, for the newest fashion required  only ribbons and laces.\"    Popopo after this found much enjoyment in visiting every millinery  shop he could find and giving new life to the stuffed birds which  were carelessly tossed aside as useless. And they flew to the fields  and forests with songs of thanks to the good knook who had rescued  them.    Sometimes a hunter fires his gun at a bird and then wonders why he  did not hit it. But, having read this story, you will understand  that the bird must have been a stuffed one from some millinery shop,  which cannot, of course, be killed by a gun.          THE LAUGHING HIPPOPOTAMUS      On one of the upper branches of the Congo river lived an ancient and  aristocratic family of hippopotamuses, which boasted a pedigree  dating back beyond the days of Noah--beyond the existence of  mankind--far into the dim ages when the world was new.    They had always lived upon the banks of this same river, so that  every curve and sweep of its waters, every pit and shallow of its  bed, every rock and stump and wallow upon its bank was as familiar  to them as their own mothers. And they are living there yet, I  suppose.    Not long ago the queen of this tribe of hippopotamuses had a child  which she named Keo, because it was so fat and round. Still, that  you may not be misled, I will say that in the hippopotamus language  \"Keo,\" properly translated, means \"fat and lazy\" instead of fat and  round. However, no one called the queen's attention to this error,  because her tusks were monstrous long and sharp, and she thought Keo  the sweetest baby in the world.    He was, indeed, all right for a hippopotamus. He rolled and played  in the soft mud of the river bank, and waddled inland to nibble the  leaves of the wild cabbage that grew there, and was happy and  contented from morning till night. And he was the jolliest  hippopotamus that ancient family had ever known. His little red eyes  were forever twinkling with fun, and he laughed his merry laugh on  all occasions, whether there was anything to laugh at or not.    Therefore the black people who dwelt in that region called him  \"Ippi\"--the jolly one, although they dared not come anigh him on  account of his fierce mother, and his equally fierce uncles and  aunts and cousins, who lived in a vast colony upon the river bank.    And while these black people, who lived in little villages scattered  among the trees, dared not openly attack the royal family of  hippopotamuses, they were amazingly fond of eating hippopotamus meat  whenever they could get it. This was no secret to the hippopotamuses.  And, again, when the blacks managed to catch these animals alive,  they had a trick of riding them through the jungles as if they were  horses, thus reducing them to a condition of slavery.    Therefore, having these things in mind, whenever the tribe of  hippopotamuses smelled the oily odor of black people they were  accustomed to charge upon them furiously, and if by chance they  overtook one of the enemy they would rip him with their sharp tusks  or stamp him into the earth with their huge feet.    It was continual warfare between the hippopotamuses and the black  people.    Gouie lived in one of the little villages of the blacks. He was the  son of the chief's brother and grandson of the village sorcerer, the  latter being an aged man known as the \"the boneless wonder,\" because  he could twist himself into as many coils as a serpent and had no  bones to hinder his bending his flesh into any position. This made  him walk in a wabbly fashion, but the black people had great respect  for him.    Gouie's hut was made of branches of trees stuck together with mud,  and his clothing consisted of a grass mat tied around his middle.  But his relationship to the chief and the sorcerer gave him a  certain dignity, and he was much addicted to solitary thought.  Perhaps it was natural that these thoughts frequently turned upon  his enemies, the hippopotamuses, and that he should consider many  ways of capturing them.    Finally he completed his plans, and set about digging a great pit in  the ground, midway between two sharp curves of the river. When the  pit was finished he covered it over with small branches of trees,  and strewed earth upon them, smoothing the surface so artfully that  no one would suspect there was a big hole underneath. Then Gouie  laughed softly to himself and went home to supper.    That evening the queen said to Keo, who was growing to be a fine  child for his age:    \"I wish you'd run across the bend and ask your Uncle Nikki to come  here. I have found a strange plant, and want him to tell me if it is  good to eat.\"    The jolly one laughed heartily as he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4358"],[0,"The Sea Fairies (#8)"],[1,"The three swam slowly along, quite enjoying the cool depths of the  water. Every little while they met with some strange creature--or  one that seemed strange to the earth people--for although Trot and  Cap'n Bill had seen many kinds of fish, after they had been caught  and pulled from the water, that was very different from meeting them  in their own element, \"face to face,\" as Trot expressed it. Now that  the various fishes were swimming around free and unafraid in their  deep-sea home, they were quite different from the gasping, excited  creatures struggling at the end of a fishline or flopping from a  net.    Before long they came upon a group of large fishes lying lazily near  the bottom of the sea. They were a dark color upon their backs and  silver underneath, but not especially pretty to look at. The fishes  made no effort to get out of Merla's way and remained motionless  except for the gentle motion of their fins and gills.    \"Here,\" said the mermaid, pausing, \"is the most aristocratic family  of fish in all the sea.\"    \"What are they?\" asked the girl.    \"Codfish,\" was the reply. \"Their only fault is that they are too  haughty and foolishly proud of their pedigree.\"    Overhearing this speech, one codfish said to another in a very  dignified tone of voice, \"What insolence!\"    \"Isn't it?\" replied the other. \"There ought to be a law to prevent  these common mermaids from discussing their superiors.\"    \"My sakes!\" said Trot, astonished. \"How stuck up they are, aren't  they?\"    For a moment the group of fishes stared at her solemnly. Then one of  the remarked in a disdainful manner, \"Come, my dear, let us leave  these vulgar creatures.\"    \"I'm not as vulgar as you are!\" exclaimed Trot, much offended by  this speech. \"Where I come from, we only eat codfish when there's  nothing else in the house to eat.\"    \"How absurd!\" observed one of the creatures arrogantly.    \"Eat codfish indeed!\" said another in a lofty manner.    \"Yes, and you're pretty salty, too, I can tell you. At home you're  nothing but a pick-up!\" said Trot.    \"Dear me!\" exclaimed the first fish who had spoken. \"Must we stand  this insulting language--and from a person to whom we have never  been introduced?\"    \"I don't need no interduction,\" replied the girl. \"I've eaten you,  and you always make me thirsty.\"    Merla laughed merrily at this, and the codfish said, with much  dignity, \"Come, fellow aristocrats, let us go.\"    \"Never mind, we're going ourselves,\" announced Merla, and followed  by her guests the pretty mermaid swam away.    \"I've heard tell of codfish aristocracy,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"but I  never knowed 'zac'ly what it meant afore.\"    \"They jus' made me mad with all their airs,\" observed Trot, \"so I  gave 'em a piece of my mind.\"    \"You surely did, mate,\" said the sailor, \"but I ain't sure they  understand what they're like when they're salted an' hung up in the  pantry. Folks gener'ly gets stuck-up 'cause they don't know  theirselves like other folks knows 'em.\"    \"We are near Crabville now,\" declared Merla. \"Shall we visit the  crabs and see what they are doing?\"    \"Yes, let's,\" replied Trot. \"The crabs are lots of fun. I've often  caught them among the rocks on the shore and laughed at the way they  act. Wasn't it funny at dinnertime to see the way they slid around  with the plates?\"    \"Those were not crabs, but lobsters and crawfish,\" remarked the  mermaid. \"They are very intelligent creatures, and by making them  serve us we save ourselves much household work. Of course, they are  awkward and provoke us sometimes, but no servants are perfect, it is  said, so we get along with ours as well as we can.\"    \"They're all right,\" protested the child, \"even if they did tip  things over once in a while. But it is easy to work in a sea palace,  I'm sure, because there's no dusting or sweeping to be done.\"    \"Or scrubbin',\" added Cap'n Bill.    \"The crabs,\" said Merla, \"are second cousins to the lobsters,  although much smaller in size. There are many families or varieties  of crabs, and so many of them live in one place near here that we  call it Crabville. I think you will enjoy seeing these little  creatures in their native haunts.\"    They now approached a kelp bed, the straight, thin stems of the kelp  running far upward to the surface of the water. Here and there upon  the stalks were leaves, but Trot thought the growing kelp looked  much like sticks of macaroni, except they were a rich red-brown  color. It was beyond the kelp--which they had to push aside as they  swam through, so thickly did it grow--that they came to a higher  level, a sort of plateau on the ocean's bottom. It was covered with  scattered rocks of all sizes, which appeared to have broken off from  big shelving rocks they observed nearby. The place they entered  seemed like one of the rocky canyons you often see upon the earth.    \"Here live the fiddler crabs,\" said Merla, \"but we must have taken  them by surprise, it is so quiet.\"    Even as she spoke, there was a stirring and scrambling among the  rocks, and soon scores of light-green crabs were gathered before the  visitors. The crabs bore fiddles of all sorts and shapes in their  claws, and one big fellow carried a leader's baton. The latter crab  climbed upon a flat rock and in an excited voice called out, \"Ready,  now--ready, good fiddlers. We'll play Number 19, Hail to the  Mermaids. Ready! Take aim! Fire away!\"    At this command every crab began scraping at his fiddle as hard as  he could, and the sounds were so shrill and unmusical that Trot  wondered when they would begin to play a tune. But they never did;  it was one regular mix-up of sounds from beginning to end. When the  noise finally stopped, the leader turned to his visitors and, waving  his baton toward them, asked, \"Well, what did you think of that?\"    \"Not much,\" said Trot honestly. \"What's it all about?\"    \"I composed it myself!\" said the Fiddler Crab. \"But it's highly  classical, I admit. All really great music is an acquired taste.\"    \"I don't like it,\" remarked Cap'n Bill. \"It might do all right to  stir up a racket New Year's Eve, but to call that screechin'  music--\"    Just then the crabs started fiddling again, harder than ever, and as  it promised to be a long performance, they left the little creatures  scraping away at their fiddles as if for dear life and swam along  the rocky canyon until, on turning a corner, they came upon a new  and different scene.    There were crabs here, too, many of them, and they were performing  the queerest antics imaginable. Some were building themselves into a  pyramid, each standing on edge, with the biggest and strongest ones  at the bottom. When the crabs were five or six rows high, they would  all tumble over, still clinging to one another and, having reached  the ground, they would separate and commence to build the pyramid  over again. Others were chasing one another around in a circle,  always moving backward or sidewise, and trying to play \"leapfrog\" as  they went. Still others were swinging on slight branches of seaweed  or turning cartwheels or indulging in similar antics.    Merla and the earth people watched the busy little creatures for  some time before they were themselves observed, but finally Trot  gave a laugh when one crab fell on its back and began frantically  waving its legs to get right-side-up again. At the sound of her  laughter they all stopped their play and came toward the visitors in  a flock, looking up at them with their bright eyes in a most comical  way.    \"Welcome home!\" cried one as he turned a back somersault and knocked  another crab over.    \"What's the difference between a mermaid and a tadpole?\" asked  another in a loud voice, and without a pause continued, \"Why, one  drops its tail and the other holds onto it. Ha, ha! Ho, ho! Hee,  hee!\"    \"These,\" said Merla, \"are the clown crabs. They are very silly  things, as you may already have discovered, but for a short time  they are rather amusing. One tires of them very soon.\"    \"They're funny,\" said Trot, laughing again. \"It's almost as good as  a circus. I don't think they would make me tired, but then I'm not a  mermaid.\"    The clown crabs had now formed a row in front of them. \"Mr.  Johnsing,\" asked one, \"why is a mermaid like an automobile?\"    \"I don't know, Tommy Blimken,\" answered a big crab in the middle of  the row. \"WHY do you think a mermaid is like an automobile?\"    \"Because they both get tired,\" said Tommy Blimken. Then all the  crabs laughed, and Tommy seemed to laugh louder than the rest.    \"How do the crabs in the sea know anything 'bout automobiles?\" asked  Trot.    \"Why, Tommy Blimken and Harry Hustle were both captured once by  humans and put in an aquarium,\" answered the mermaid. \"But one day  they climbed out and escaped, finally making their way back to the  sea and home again. So they are quite traveled, you see, and great  favorites among the crabs. While they were on land they saw a great  many curious things, and so I suppose they saw automobiles.\"    \"We did, we did!\" cried Harry Hustle, an awkward crab with one big  claw and one little one. \"And we saw earth people with legs, awfully  funny they were; and animals called horses, with legs; and other  creatures with legs; and the people cover themselves with the  queerest things--they even wear feathers and flowers on their heads,  and--\"    \"Oh, we know all about that,\" said Trot. \"We live on the earth  ourselves.\"    \"Well, you're lucky to get off from it and into the good water,\"  said the Crab. \"I nearly died on the earth; it was so stupid, dry  and airy. But the circus was great. They held the performance right  in front of the aquarium where we lived, and Tommy and I learned all  the tricks of the tumblers. Hi! Come on, fellows, and show the earth  people what you can do!\"    At this the crabs began performing their antics again, but they did  the same things over and over, so Cap'n Bill and Trot"]]]
