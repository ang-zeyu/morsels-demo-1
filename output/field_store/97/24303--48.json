[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35830"],[0,"The 2010 CIA World Factbook (#8)"],[1,"termined, market exchange rates are frequently established  by a relatively small set of goods and services (the ones the  country trades) and may not capture the value of the larger set of  goods the country produces. Furthermore, OER-converted GDP is not  well suited to comparing domestic GDP over time, since  appreciation/depreciation from one year to the next will make the  OER GDP value rise/fall regardless of whether  home-currency-denominated GDP changed.        GDP (purchasing power parity)      This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all  final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. A  nation's GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates is the  sum value of all goods and services produced in the country valued  at prices prevailing in the United States. This is the measure most  economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when  comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries.  The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar value has to be  assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of  whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the  United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US  military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries  are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and  services. In addition, many countries do not formally participate in  the World Bank's PPP project that calculates these measures, so the  resulting GDP estimates for these countries may lack precision. For  many developing countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of  the official exchange rate (OER) measure. The differences between  the OER- and PPP-denominated GDP values for most of the wealthy  industrialized countries are generally much smaller.        GDP - composition by sector      This entry gives the percentage contribution of agriculture,  industry, and services to total GDP. The distribution will total  less than 100 percent if the data are incomplete.        GDP - per capita (PPP)      This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity basis divided by  population as of 1 July for the same year.        GDP - real growth rate      This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis adjusted for  inflation and expressed as a percent.    GDP methodology      In the Economy category, GDP dollar estimates for countries are  reported both on an official exchange rate (OER) and a purchasing  power parity (PPP) basis. Both measures contain information that is  useful to the reader. The PPP method involves the use of  standardized international dollar price weights, which are applied  to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given  economy. The data derived from the PPP method probably provide the  best available starting point for comparisons of economic strength  and well-being between countries. In contrast, the currency exchange  rate method involves a variety of international and domestic  financial forces that may not capture the value of domestic output.  Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP  estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations.  In developing countries with weak currencies, the exchange rate  estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the  PPP estimate. Most of the GDP estimates for developing countries are  based on extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the UN  International Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert  Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their  colleagues. GDP derived using the OER method should be used for the  purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports, imports,  military expenditures, external debt, or the current account  balance, because the dollar values presented in the Factbook for  these items have been converted at official exchange rates, not at  PPP. One should use the OER GDP figure to calculate the proportion  of, say, Chinese defense expenditures in GDP, because that share  will be the same as one calculated in local currency units.  Comparison of OER GDP with PPP GDP may also indicate whether a  currency is over- or under-valued. If OER GDP is smaller than PPP  GDP, the official exchange rate may be undervalued, and vice versa.  However, there is no strong historical evidence that market exchange  rates move in the direction implied by the PPP rate, at least not in  the short- or medium-term. Note: the numbers for GDP and other  economic data should not be chained together from successive volumes  of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring rod,  revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or different  sources of information, and changes in national statistical methods  and practices.        Geographic coordinates      This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the  purpose of finding the approximate geographic center of an entity  and is based on the locations provided in the Geographic Names  Server (GNS), maintained by the National Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency on behalf of the US Board on Geographic Names.    Geographic names      This information is presented in This information is presented in <a  href = \"../appendix/appendix-f.html\"Appendix F: Cross Reference List  of Geographic Names. It includes a listing of various alternate  names, former names, local names, and regional names referenced to  one or more related Factbook entries. Spellings are normally, but  not always, those approved by the US Board on Geographic Names  (BGN). Alternate names and additional information are included in  parentheses.    Geography      This category includes the entries dealing with the natural  environment and the effects of human activity.        Geography - note      This entry includes miscellaneous geographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Gini index      See entry for Distribution of family income - Gini index    GNP      Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and  services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income  earned by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners  from domestic production. The Factbook, following current practice,  uses GDP rather than GNP to measure national production. However,  the user must realize that in certain countries net remittances from  citizens working abroad may be important to national well-being.    Government      This category includes the entries dealing with the system for the  adoption and administration of public policy.        Government - note      This entry includes miscellaneous government information of  significance not included elsewhere.        Government type      This entry gives the basic form of government. Definitions of the  major governmental terms are as follows. (Note that for some  countries more than one definition applies.):  Absolute monarchy - a form of government where the monarch rules  unhindered, i.e., without any laws, constitution, or legally  organized opposition.  Anarchy - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought  about by the absence of governmental authority.  Authoritarian - a form of government in which state authority is  imposed onto many aspects of citizens' lives.  Commonwealth - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on  law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.  Communist - a system of government in which the state plans and  controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party  holds power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of  private ownership of property or capital while claiming to make  progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally  shared by the people (i.e., a classless society).  Confederacy (Confederation) - a union by compact or treaty between  states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government  with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme  authority over all matters except those delegated to the central  government.  Constitutional - a government by or operating under an authoritative  document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental  laws and principles that determines the nature, functions, and  limits of that government.  Constitutional democracy - a form of government in which the  sovereign power of the people is spelled out in a governing  constitution.  Constitutional monarchy - a system of government in which a monarch  is guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and  responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.  Democracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is  retained by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly  through a system of representation and delegated authority  periodically renewed.  Democratic republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in  the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and  representatives responsible to them.  Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique  wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).  Ecclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.  Emirate - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in  which the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a  Muslim state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign  with constitutionally limited authority.  Federal (Federation) - a form of government in which sovereign power  is formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a  central authority and a number of constituent regions (states,  colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management  of its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the  central government exerts influence directly upon both individuals  as well as upon the regional units.
