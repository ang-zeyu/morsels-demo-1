This is essential.  Then sit  down and read till the water boils.  Now take your \"spurckle\" or  \"whurtle\" in your right hand--I don't know the English of \"spurckle\" or  \"whurtle,\" but it is a round piece of wood, rather thicker than your  thumb and not so long as your arm, and you never see it silver-mounted--  and commence operations.  You stir in the meal very gradually, to  prevent its getting knotted, and you occasionally pause to let it boil a  moment, and you continue this until the porridge is quite thick, and the  bubbles rise into small mountains ere they escape, with a sound between  a \"whitch\" and a \"whirr,\" which is in itself a pleasure to listen to.  And now it is ready, and you have only to pour it into a large  soup-plate, sprinkle a little dry oatmeal over the top of it, and set it  aside until reasonably cold.  You eat it with a spoon--not a fork--and  with nice sweet milk.  \"A dish fit for a king,\" you say; \"A dish fit for  the gods!\"  I resound.  Now, having told you all this, I feel I have  well deserved of my country; and I'm not above accepting--a hamper at  any time.    Bread-and-milk, soaked, is the next best thing for pussy; and at dinner  you must let her have a wee bit of meat.  Lights, boiled and cut in  pieces, are best, but horseflesh isn't bad; but you mustn't give her too  much of either, or you will induce diarrhoea.  Give her fish,  occasionally, as a treat.  If pussy is a show cat, a little morsel of  butter, given every day, after dinner, will make her dress her jacket  with surprising regularity.    Now, as to what she drinks, a well-bred cat is always particular, and at  times even fastidious; but two things they must have--water and milk.  They will often prefer the former to the latter.  _But do keep their  dishes clean_.  Disease is often brought on from neglect of this  precaution.  Cats will drink tea or beer, and I have seen a Tom get as  drunk as a duke on oatmeal and whisky.  An old lady, an acquaintance of  mine, has a fine red-and-white Tom, and whenever he is ailing she gives  him \"just a leetle drop o' brandy, sir.\"  Tom, I think, must have had  two little drops o' brandy yesterday, when he rode my fox-terrier,  Princie, all round the paddock.  Those naughty drops o' brandy!    Just one word about housing.  There is no more objectionable practice  than that of turning your cat out of doors at night, and none more  certain to engender disease and spoil your pussy's morals.  If you have  taken the least pains to train your cat to habits of cleanliness, she  will never misbehave herself.  Keep her in at night, then, and you'll  have her in health; keep her in if you want to run no risk of getting  her poisoned; keep her in, and the neighbours will bless you.  Don't  lock her into a room, though, unless she has an attic to herself.  Let  her have the run of the house from basement to roof.  Give pussy a bed  to lie on, or let her find one for herself, which she has a happy knack  of doing, as I daresay more than one of my readers can testify.  My  pretty Phiz needn't have kittened in my cocked hat, nevertheless.    So much, then, for the prevention of disease.  We will now come to  diseases themselves.  But just let me impress upon your mind, reader,  this fact--that attention to your pussy's housing, drink, and the  cleanliness and regularity of her diet, will almost certainly prevent  her from getting sick.    CHAPTER NINE.    THE DISEASES OF CATS.    Before describing the management and treatment of feline ailments, I may  as well mention that there are three different plans usually adopted for  giving a cat medicine.  Pussy must first and foremost be caught--not  always an easy job, as the little creature is fond of hiding away when  ill.  Take her on your knee, and, as you gently soothe her, envelope  her, all save the head, in a woollen shawl, and then place her in some  one else's arms to hold.  Now, if it is a pill or small bolus it must be  dipped in oil, and placed well down behind the tongue, and towards the  roof of the mouth; if it is a powder, it may simply be placed on the  tongue; but the better plan is to mix it first with a little treacle or  glycerine; thirdly, if it is a fluid, the mouth must be held well open,  and the medicine poured down the throat out of a small phial, but only a  few drops at a time.    If your cat is suffering from any severe illness, such as bronchitis,  and you value her, set aside a garret or lumber-room for her  accommodation, for quiet is essential to her recovery.  Arrange her bed  as common sense tells you will best suit her comfort; don't forget to  let her have plenty of clean water to drink, and a large box of garden  mould in the far corner of the room.  There is only one other little  matter, which must not be overlooked--and, with this, pussy's little  hospital is complete--Grass.    _Grass_.--This is the natural medicine of both cat and dog.  In large  doses, it acts as an emetic; in smaller, as a purgative; its mode of  action being similar in both cases, namely, mechanical irritation of the  muscular and mucous coats of the alimentary canal; this causing  spasmodic contraction of the stomach, or increasing the peristaltic  motions of bowel.  Grass also possesses valuable antiscorbutic  properties, and the cat, either in sickness or health, should never want  a supply of it.    If pussy has been out all night at a feline entertainment on the tiles,  and the excitement has produced constipation, her remedy is grass.  If  she has made too free in the aviary, and the feathers of the Norwich  cock lie unpleasantly on her stomach, grass is her cure; or if she, at  any time, feels hot or feverish, out into the garden she goes, and a  little grass, taken at intervals, soon makes her feel as fresh as the  lark.    Don't let your cat want grass, then; if you live in a town, and she has  some difficulty in getting it, either procure it for her yourself, or,  what is better, get a boxful of earth, and sow it, and call it pussy's  garden.  Now for pussy's ailments.    _Mange_.--All skin diseases in the cat, whether pustular, papular, or  squamous, may be, for convenience' sake, called _mange_.  Cats are very  subject to skin diseases, especially long-haired ones, and those who  have been the subjects of bad or careless treatment; for they are always  brought about by poverty of the blood, from under-feeding, or surfeit  from over-eating on dainties.  Now I must warn the cat-fancier that  there is no _specific_ for the cure of mange in the cat, and that the  cure will take weeks, and at times even months; he must therefore make  up his mind either to destroy the cat at once, or set about curing her  in earnest.  Attend, in the first place, to her diet.  It must be  nourishing, but not heating; plenty of good milk, and no meat, unless  she be very thin, when raw meat in small quantities may be given twice a  day.  Dress the skin with carbolic oil, washing her carefully next day;  then try equal parts of sulphur-ointment and green iodide of mercury  ointment, mixed with an equal bulk of lard.  Give her arsenic  internally--one drop of the _Liquor arsenicalis_ twice a day, in milk,  for a week, then thrice a day for another week, when you must omit it  for a day or two, and then begin again.  At the same time give her, once  or twice a week, a little sulphur.  Placing brimstone-roll in a cat's  drinking-water is all a mistake, and does no good at all.  Sometimes the  disease will only yield to a course of iodide of potash.  Give her  half-grain or whole-grain doses, made into little boluses with  breadcrumbs--which any chemist can make for you--twice a day.    _Ulcers_.--Cats are liable to a variety of these, but they can best and  most conveniently be described as of two sorts--_constitutional_ and  _accidental_.  The first are the most difficult to cure, and are usually  found on the toes or feet.  Confine the cat to the house for a term; any  simple ointment, such as that of zinc, will do for a dressing, as it  will not hurt her if she licks it.  Put her on a course of arsenic, as  recommended above; give her, once a week, one grain of calomel, or two  or three grains of grey powder and a little sulphur; and, if the sores  appear sluggish, touch them once a day with blue-stone or nitrate of  silver.  Feed her well and regularly.    _Accidental ulcers_ are generally the result of scratches and wounds  received in the hunting-field, or during some slight difference of  opinion with the pussy over the way.  They require no internal  treatment.  If they look angry, bathe in warm water, or milk and water,  and use, occasionally, a little lotion of sulphate of zinc--ten grains  to four ounces of water, to which add one drachm of tincture of  lavender.  If the sores are sluggish, and indisposed to heal kindly,  truss the cat in the shawl, and cauterise with nitrate of silver;  afterwards dress with the mildest mercurial ointment.    _Inflammation of the eyes_ is generally the result of injury or cold  caught from exposure.  It may be confined to one eye, or may attack  both.  In either case the treatment is the same.  Begin by the use of a  purgative--say two or three grains of compound jalap-powder mixed in  glycerine, and given in the morning; give nothing but bread-and-milk to  eat, and let the cat have a little sulphur mixed with butter or lard  every second day.  The external treatment consists in bathing frequently  with warm water or weak green tea, and the following lotion, may  afterwards be used with advantage: two grains of sulphate of zinc to an  ounce of water, or one grain of nitrate of silver to the same quantity  of _aqua pura_.    _Simple Maladies_.--If you are fond of your cat you will naturally  easily know when she is getting out of sorts or going to be ill.  When  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37363"],[0,"Making Up with Mr. Dog (#8)"],[1,"this, but that they were following Spring around  the world. And they told him all that Mr. Man had said to Mr. Dog, and  what Mr. Fox had said, and about Jack Rabbit's poem. Mr. Wolf thought  he'd better be wise, too, until he found out just how things were, so he  said:--    \"Sure enough! That's a good plan. I'd go along if I had time. I know the  way well. You just keep on till you come to that creek yonder, then  cross and turn to the right, and after that any one can show you the  way.\"    So away went the Hollow Tree people, and when they got to the creek, and  crossed, and turned to the right, there was the bluebird again, hopping  and whistling and dancing on ahead, just in the direction that Mr. Wolf  had said to go. Then, pretty soon, Mr. 'Possum said he was hungry, so  they sat down on some moss and ate their lunch, and Mr. Bluebird came up  close and sang to them till Mr. 'Possum went to sleep in the sun and  took a little nap, while the 'Coon and the Crow put what was left back  into the basket and got ready to go. Then Mr. 'Possum woke up and said  he was sure they must be nearly around the world, for he'd just had a  dream about catching a chicken with four legs and two heads, and he knew  that must mean something good. So then they went on and the bluebird  went ahead, until they came to a fine, big cave, where Mr. Bear lived.    Now, Mr. Bear is very big and wise--at least he thinks he is--and he  knew right away that Mr. Dog was just playing a joke on them, or at  least he thought he did, so he said:--    \"Well, well! I supposed you fellows knew all that long ago. You don't  mean to say, do you, that this is really your first time round? Why, I  go round the world every spring and fall, and buy most of my things on  the other side. You just follow this path till you come to a big black  rock, and then turn to the right and keep straight ahead. You can't miss  the way.\"    [Illustration: \"FOLLOW THIS PATH TILL YOU COME TO A BIG BLACK ROCK,\"  SAID MR. BEAR]    Then Mr. Bear went back in his cave, and laid down and rolled over and  laughed to think what a big joke everybody was playing on the Hollow  Tree people. But the Hollow Tree people kept right on, for they saw Mr.  Bluebird still whistling and dancing on ahead; and by and by they came  to the big black rock that Mr. Bear had mentioned, and turned to the  right again as he had told them to do. Then they walked and walked,  and Mr. Bluebird hopped and skipped and whistled, until at last, just as  they were all getting very tired and it was 'most night, they came to a  big hollow tree in a deep woods; and Mr. 'Possum looked up and says:--    \"Why,\" he says, \"this tree looks a good deal like our tree!\"    And Mr. 'Coon, he says:--    \"Why, it's just like our tree!\"    And Mr. Crow, he says:--    \"Why, it _is_ our tree!\" for of course they'd turned to the right three  times, which brought them right back where they started from, though  they did not know it.    So then all at once they commenced to laugh and shout:--    \"We've done it! We've done it!            \"We've followed Spring around the world,             According to the plan!           Hurrah for Mr. Rabbit!             And hurrah for Mr. Man!\"    [Illustration: AND MR. CROW, HE SAYS, \"WHY, IT _IS_ OUR TREE!\"]    And the bluebird up in the branches whistled and danced and shouted,  too; and Jack Rabbit and Mr. Dog came over pretty soon to see if  they'd got home yet. And of course Mr. Rabbit was proud about the way  his poem had turned out; and Mr. Dog he was proud, too, on Mr. Man's  account. Then they all had a big supper, to celebrate, and by and by Mr.  Rabbit and Mr. Dog went away arm in arm, singing Mr. Rabbit's poem to  the moon; while the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old Black Crow went to bed  happy because they had followed Spring clear around the world, and  hadn't got lost or tumbled off into the sky, but were home again safe  and sound in the Hollow Tree.
