There stands a little man in the wood alone,      he wears a little mantle of velvet brown.      Say, who can the mankin be,      standing there beneath the tree,      with the little mantle of velvet brown?      His hair is all of gold, and his cheeks are red,      he wears a little black cap upon his head.      Say, who can the mankin be,      standing there so silently,      with the little black cap upon his head?    (_She holds up the garland of roses, and looks it all round._)        With the little black cap upon his head!    HAeNSEL    (_comes out, swinging his basket joyfully_).        Hurrah! my strawberry basket is nearly brimful!      O won't the mother be pleased with Haensel!    GRETEL (_standing up_).        My garland is ready also!      Look! I never made one so nice before!    (_Tries to put the wreath on Haensel's head._)    HAeNSEL (_drawing back roughly_).        You won't catch a boy wearing that!      It is only fit for a girl!    (_Puts the wreath on her._)        Ha, Gretel! \"Fine feathers!\"      O the deuce!      You shall be the queen of the wood!    GRETEL.        If I am to be queen of the wood,      then I must have the nosegay too!    HAeNSEL (_gives her the nosegay_).        Queen of the wood, with sceptre and crown,      I give you the strawberries,      but don't eat them all!    (_He gives the basket full of strawberries into her other hand, at the  same time kneeling before her in homage. At this moment the cuckoo is  heard._)        Cuckoo, cuckoo, how d'you do?    GRETEL.        Cuckoo, cuckoo, where are you?    (_Takes a strawberry from the basket and pokes it into Haensel's mouth;  he sucks it up as though he were drinking an egg._)    HAeNSEL (_jumping up_).        Oho, I can do that just like you!    (_Takes some strawberries and lets them fall into Gretel's mouth._)        Let us do like the cuckoo too,      who takes what doesn't belong to him!    (_It begins to grow dark._)    HAeNSEL (_helping himself again_).        Cuckoo, how are you?    GRETEL.        Cuckoo, where are you?    HAeNSEL.        In your neighbour's nest you go.    GRETEL (_helping herself_).        Cuckoo, cuckoo!    HAeNSEL.        Cuckoo, why do you do so?    (_Pours a handful of strawberries into his mouth._)    GRETEL.        And you are very greedy too!      Tell me, cuckoo, why are you?    HAeNSEL.        Cuckoo, cuckoo!    (_They get rude and begin to quarrel for the strawberries. Haensel gains  the victory, and puts the whole basket to his mouth until it is empty._)    GRETEL    (_horrified, clasping her hands together_).        Haensel, what have you done?      O Heaven! all the strawberries eaten.      You glutton! Listen, you'll have a punishment      from the mother--this passes a joke!    HAeNSEL (_quietly_).        Now come, don't make such a fuss;      you, Gretel, you did the same thing yourself!    GRETEL.        Come, we'll hurry and seek for fresh ones!    HAeNSEL.        What, here in the dark, under hedges and bushes?      Why, naught can we see of fruit or leaves!      It's getting dark already here!    GRETEL.        O Haensel! O Haensel! O what shall we do?      What bad disobedient children we've been!      We ought to have thought and gone home sooner!    (_Cuckoo behind the scenes, rather nearer than before._)    HAeNSEL.        Hark, what a noise in the bushes!      Know you what the forest says?      \"Children, children,\" it says,      \"Are you not afraid?\"    (_Haensel spies all around uneasily, at last he turns in despair to  Gretel._)        Gretel, I cannot find the way!    GRETEL (_dismayed_).        O God! what say you?      Not know the way?    HAeNSEL    (_pretending to be very brave_).        Why, how ridiculous you are!      I am a boy, and know not fear!    GRETEL.        O Haensel, some dreadful thing may come!    HAeNSEL.        O Gretel, come, don't be afraid!    GRETEL.        What's glimmering there in the darkness?    HAeNSEL.        That's only the birches in silver dress.    GRETEL.        But there, what's grinning so there at me?    HAeNSEL (_stammering_).        Th--that's only the stump of a willow-tree.    GRETEL (_hastily_).        But what a dreadful form it takes,      and what a horrid face it makes!    HAeNSEL (_very loud_).        Come, I'll make faces, you fellow!      D'you hear?    GRETEL (_terrified_).        There, see! a lantern,      it's coming this way!    HAeNSEL.        Will-o'-the-wisp is hopping about--      Gretel, come, don't lose heart like this!      Wait, I'll give a good loud call!    (_Goes back some steps to the back of the stage and calls through his  hands._)        Who's there?    ECHO.        You there!      There!    (_The children cower together._)    GRETEL.        Is some one there?    ECHO.        Where?      Here!    GRETEL (_softly_).        Did you hear? a voice said, \"Here!\"      Haensel, surely some one's near.    (_Crying._)        I'm frightened, I'm frightened,      I wish I were home!      I see the wood all filled with goblin forms!    HAeNSEL.        Gretelkin, stick to me close and tight,      I'll shelter you, I'll shelter you!    (_A thick mist rises and completely hides the background._)    GRETEL.        I see some shadowy women coming!      See, how they nod and beckon, beckon!      They're coming, they're coming,      they'll take us away!    (_Crying out, rushes horror-struck under the tree and falls on her  knees, hiding herself behind Haensel._)        Father! mother! Ah!    HAeNSEL.        See there, the mankin, sister dear!      I wonder who the mankin is?    (_At this moment the mist lifts on the left; a little grey man is seen  with a little sack on his back._)      Scene II.    SANDMAN (_the Sleep Fairy_).    (_The little man approaches the children with friendly gestures, and  the children gradually calm down. He is strewing sand in the children's  eyes._)        I shut the children's peepers, sh!      and guard the little sleepers, sh!      for dearly do I love them, sh!      and gladly watch above them, sh!      And with my little bag of sand,      By every child's bedside I stand;      then little tired eyelids close,      and little limbs have sweet repose.      And if they're good and quickly go to sleep,      then from the starry sphere above      the angels come with peace and love,      and send the children happy dreams,      while watch they keep!      Then slumber, children, slumber,      for happy dreams are sent you      through the hours you sleep.    (_Disappears. Darkness._)    HAeNSEL (_half asleep_).        Sandman was there!    GRETEL (_ditto_).        Let us first say our evening prayer.    (_They cower down and fold their hands._)    BOTH.            When at night I go to sleep,          fourteen angels watch do keep:          two my head are guarding,          two my feet are guiding,          two are on my right hand,          two are on my left hand,          two who warmly cover,          two who o'er me hover,          two to whom 'tis given          to guide my steps to Heaven.    (_They sink down on to the moss, and go to sleep with their arms twined  round each other. Complete darkness._)      Scene III.    (_Here a bright light suddenly breaks through the mist which forthwith  rolls itself together into the form of a staircase, vanishing in  perspective, in the middle of the stage. Fourteen angels, in light  floating garments, pass down the staircase, two and two, at intervals,  while it is getting gradually lighter. The angels place themselves,  according to the order mentioned in the evening hymn, around the  sleeping children; the first couple at their heads, the second at  their feet, the third on the right, the fourth on the left, the fifth  and sixth couples distribute themselves amongst the other couples, so  that the circle of the angels is completed. Lastly the seventh couple  comes into the circle and takes its place as \"guardian angels\" on each  side of the children. The remaining angels now join hands and dance  a stately step around the group. The whole stage is filled with an  intense light. Whilst the angels arrange themselves in a picturesque  tableau, the curtain slowly falls._)          ACT III.    THE WITCH'S HOUSE.      Scene I.    (_The curtain rises.

The day  after my arrival, he took me round his property, and explained the various  improvements he had made, considering the small means with which he had  commenced. At this part of our conversation, we came within view of his  house, a substantial weather-board cottage. \"I trust,\" said I, turning  to him, \"you will excuse the question I am about to ask; for your  frankness emboldens me to propose it, and on your answer much of the  effect of what you have been saying will depend. In effecting these  various improvements, and in the building of that house, have you been  obliged to embarrass yourself, or are they free from incumbrance?\"--\"Your  question,\" he said, \"is a reasonable one, and I will answer it with the  frankness you are kind enough to ascribe to me. I have ever made it a rule  not to exceed my income. Mrs. ****** bore our first trials with so much  cheerfulness, and contributed so much to my happiness and my prosperity,  that I felt myself bound to build her a good house with the first money  I had to spare.\" I confess this answer raised my host in my estimation,  and it was a gratifying proof to me of the success that attends industry  and perseverance.    But let us look at another case. Mr. *** had a property to the N.W. of  Sydney, and having considerable funded means when he arrived in the  colony, he soon put his property into a state of progressive improvement,  and being in truth an excellent practical farmer, it assumed the  appearance of regularity and order. Had Mr. *** stopped at this moment,  he would have been in the enjoyment of affluence and of every rational  comfort. But instead of exercising prudent rules of hospitality, he gave  way to the natural generosity of his disposition, entered into expenses he  could not afford, and was ultimately obliged to part with his estate. Now  it is deeply to be regretted, that one whose energies and abilities  particularly fitted him for the life he had chosen, should have failed  through such conduct; and it is more than probable, that if he had  commenced with smaller means, and had gradually improved his property, his  fate would have been very different.    I shall leave these cases without any further comment, convinced as I am,  that each of them furnishes matter for serious consideration, and that  they are practical illustrations of the causes of success or failure of  those who emigrate to the colony of New South Wales. And although I do not  mean to affirm, that the majority follow Mr. ***'s example, I must venture  to assert that thoughtlessness--useless expenditure in the first  instance--waste of time and other circumstances, lead to equally ruinous  consequences.    MORAL OBJECTIONS TO THE COLONY.    One of the greatest objections which families have to New South Wales, is  their apprehension of the moral effects that are likely to overwhelm them  by bad example, and for which no success in life could compensate. In a  colony constituted like that of New South Wales, the proportion of crime  must of course be great. Yet it falls less under the notice of private  families than one might at first sight have been led to suppose.  Drunkenness, as in the mother country, is the besetting sin; but it is  confined chiefly to the large towns in consequence of the difficulty of  procuring spirits in the country. There are, no doubt, many incorrigible  characters sent to settle in the interior, and it is an evil to have these  men, even for a single day, to break the harmony of a previously well  regulated establishment, or to injure its future prospects by the  influence of evil example. They are men who are sent upon trial, from on  board a newly arrived ship, and they generally terminate their misconduct  either on the roads or at a penal settlement, being thus happily removed  from the mass of the prisoners. Frequently, however, men remain for years  under the same master. They become attached to their occupations, their  hearts become softened by kindness, and they atone as much as they  possibly can for previous error.    SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION RECOMMENDED; ENCOURAGEMENT FOR EMIGRATION.    Still there can be no doubt, but that the evil complained of is  considerable. It is from this reason, and from my personal knowledge of  the southern parts of the colony, that I should rejoice to see its flats  and its valleys filled with an industrious population of a better  description of farmers. A hope might then be reasonably indulged, that the  Home Government would not be backward in recognising, and in acting upon  a principle, the soundness of which has been felt and acknowledged in all  ages, but the chief difficulty of which rests in its judicious  application. I allude to a system of emigration. Sure I am that if it were  well organized, and care were taken to profit by the experience of the  past in similar attempts, it could not fail to be attended with ultimate  success. The evils resulting from a surplus population in an old  community, were never more seriously felt than in Great Britain at the  present moment. Assuming that the amount of surplus population is  2,000,000, the excess of labour and competition thus occasioned by  diminishing profits and wages, creates, it has been said, an indirect tax  to the enormous extent of 20,000,000 pounds per annum. It has appeared  to many experienced persons, that it is in emigration, we should best find  the means of relief from this heavy pressure; particularly if the  individuals encouraged to go out to the colonies were young persons of  both sexes, from the industrious classes of the community. Even if no  more than three couples were induced to emigrate from each parish in  England in ten years, the relief to the springs of industry would be very  great. Besides, the funds necessary for this purpose would revert to the  country by a thousand indirect channels. Persons unacquainted with our  Australian colonies, whether Van Dieman's Land or New South Wales, can  form little idea of the increasing demand for, and consumption in them of  every species of British manufacture. The liberal encouragement given by  government to every practicable scheme of emigration, and the sum advanced  by it towards the expenses of the voyage to the labouring classes,  sufficiently indicate the light in which the subject is viewed by the  legislature; and the fact that no private family taking out servants to  Sydney, has in any one instance been able to retain them, on account of  offers more advantageous from other quarters, shows clearly the great  demand for labour in the colony. If I might judge of the feelings of the  majority of respectable individuals there, from the assurances of the few,  they would willingly defray any parochial expenses attendant on the  voyage, provided the services of such individuals could be secured to them  for a time sufficiently long to remunerate them for such pavement. The  tide of emigration should be directed to Sydney, Van Dieman's Land, or  Western Australia, upon condition of the labourer's receiving a certain  sum in wages, and his daily subsistence from his employer, with an  understanding, however, that he must consider himself bound for two years  to such employer. Surely there are hundreds of our indigent countrymen,  who would gladly seek a land of such plenty, and cast away the natural,  but unavailing regret of leaving home to secure to themselves and their  families, the substantial comforts of life on such easy conditions.    COMMITTEE FOUND AT SYDNEY.    It is not, perhaps, generally known that a committee has been formed in  Sydney, to advise settlers as to the best mode of proceeding on arrival  there. Such a plan is one of obvious utility; and if those who may find  themselves at a loss for information would apply to this committee for  advice, rather than to individuals with whom they may become casually  acquainted, they would further their own interests, and in all probability  ensure success. Still there are some broad rules upon which every man  ought to act, which I shall endeavour to point out, and it will give me no  ordinary satisfaction, if I should be the means of directing any one to  the road of prosperity and comfort.    HINTS TO EMIGRANTS.    It is to be feared that those who emigrate to New South Wales, generally  anticipate too great facility in their future operations and certainty of  success in conducting them; but they should recollect that competency  cannot be obtained without labour. Every trade--every profession in this  respect, is subject to the same law--the lawyer, the physician, the  tradesman, and the mechanic. This labour is required at our hands, even in  an old community; how much more then is it called for in a new, where the  ingenuity of men is put to trial to secure those means of accomplishing  their ends which here are abundant. Now, it appears to me but consistent,  that he who is obliged to leave his native country from want of means to  hold his station there, can hardly expect to find, or rather to secure,  abundance elsewhere without some exertion. Every man who emigrates should  proceed with a conviction on his mind, that he is about to encounter years  of labour and privation. He will not then be disappointed at partial  reverses, and will be more thankful for unexpected prosperity. I feel  persuaded the tone of mind has a great deal to do with success, because it  influences the conduct of the individual. Supposing, however, that an  emigrant has taken this rational view of his situation, he should  determine on his pursuits, and allow nothing but absolute certainty of  better fortune to turn him aside. Men, however, landing at Sydney, in  their eagerness for information get bewildered, give up their original  plans, adopt new and uncertain speculations, trifle away both their time  and their money, and ultimately ruin themselves.
