When visiting with other families,  it seemed odd to me to hear them call their babies by their given  names.  We always called our youngest one \"Baby\" until the next  one arrived.  Then we called the new one \"Baby\" and the one  before him had to take on his rightful name.    This went on until my younger brother was born.  Joel, just older  than I, couldn't say Clarence, so he called me Big Baby and he  called the new one Baby.  No, he wasn't slow about learning to  talk.  You see, we didn't give him much time.  He was only  sixteen months old when I came along, and he was just three when  the new one came.  Another custom not common to all families was,  we smaller ones wore dresses around home for the first three or  four years of our lives.  It made diapering much easier and saved  a lot of laundering.  Come to think of it, I never heard of  diapers until I was almost grown.  They were not diapers, they  were breeches--in our family they were \"britches.\"  That's the  only thing I ever heard them called until I was a mature man.    We were poor people, living the simple life.  I wasn't any poorer  than the rest of my family, but I was the simplest one.    We also had this custom of competing among ourselves.  In most  everything we did, there was an element of competition and hurry.  Our parents had a way of causing us kids to apply pressure to  each other.  They found that it worked better than when parents  tried to force kids to work faster.    In the cotton patch you could hear us kids saying such things as,  \"I picked more cotton than you did.\"  Or if we were hoeing you  might hear something like, \"Come on, Slow Poke.\"    The plan worked well.  No one wanted to be outdone by a brother,  especially a little brother.  And if a little brother could  outshine a big brother, even just once in awhile, that was a real  feather in the little one's cap.    Oh, yes!  There was hurry and there was pressure.  But it didn't  seem to get us down as it does some people today.  We had no  psychologists in those days to tell us that pressures would warp  a kid's brain.  We didn't know that competition and hurry would  drive us crazy until these educated people told us about it.    So we lived hard, we worked hard, and we played hard.  Then we  were able to go to bed and sleep hard.  Never in my life did I  ever hear Mama or Papa say, \"I didn't sleep well last night,  because I felt tense and worried.\"    There was really nothing to worry about like there is today.  They didn't worry that we kids might go away from home and get  into trouble.  We didn't have to leave home to get into trouble.  We kids made our own trouble right at home.  We had a lot of fun  doing a lot of different things.  Most of our troubles were  brought on accidentally, we didn't deliberately plan them.    There was no worry about the family losing anything, we had  nothing to lose.  No one would steal from us because no one  wanted what we had.  So, whatever pressures we might encounter  during the day were dispelled during a night of welcome rest.    In the cotton patch Mama and Papa encouraged us to see who could  pick 100 bolls first.  The first one to pick his 100 bolls would  call out, \"hundred.\"  Then each of the others would call out the  number of bolls they had picked during the same time.    This competition got more bales of cotton to the gin in a shorter  period of time.  But, as in all activities where kids are  involved, we sometimes had little disagreements.    I had this thing of humming or singing a song while I picked  cotton and counted my bolls.  I found that the mental work I was  doing was relaxing and it allowed my hands to do their work  faster.  And now, 65 years later, I learn that I was doing  something a little bit kin to what they call Yoga.    At any rate, it really worked for me.  I could pick cotton faster  than a brother or two who were older than I was.  Now, I didn't  necessarily use my system in order to get more of the family  cotton picked.  I used it mainly just to beat my older brothers  picking cotton, and that not for very long at a time.    But my little scheme backfired on me.  One of those brothers  couldn't stand to be outdone by a younger brother.  He told Mama  and Papa that I was lying and cheating, because he knew I  couldn't count bolls while I sang a song.  But he was wrong.  I  could.  Anyway, nothing I could say would make him believe me.  I  began to become an outcast among some of my brothers early in  life.  I believe there were times when some of them would have  been glad to \"sell me into slavery\" as Joseph's brothers did him.    But my parents didn't seem to doubt my word.  I really believe  they understood that I could do a thing or two that some of the  others could not do--and perhaps were not at all interested in  doing.    I believe little things like that were the beginning of a wee bit  of an unconscious rift between some of my brothers and me, and at  the same time, the making of a stronger bond between my parents  and me.    Looking back, I remember many times when Papa and I were doing  things together and there was no one else around.  I really don't  know why I was the only one there a lot of times.  Maybe I just  wanted to be in good company.  I loved and admired Papa and I  thought he was the best and nicest man in the world.  Or perhaps  I was with Papa because of my inquisitive mind concerning  mechanical things, like,    \"How do you shoe a horse?\"    \"How do you tighten a loose wagon tire?\"    \"How do you make a row-binder do what you want it to do when the  manufacturer couldn't seem to do it?\"    I watched him do all these things and many more.  And many of the  things he did fascinated me.    The situation was much the same between Mama and me.    \"How do you churn milk and make butter?\"    \"How do you 'take up' the butter after it is churned?\"    \"How do you make those beautiful decorations on it later?\"    \"How do you weave a carpet on Grandma's loom?\"    It seems I was always watching a lot of these goings-on while the  other kids were somewhere else doing whatever they liked to do.  And Mama and Papa were never too busy to answer my questions.  I  realize now how much more I could have learned if I had only  known how and when to ask more questions.    It seems that my parents favored and petted me at times.  I'm not  sure they did.  If they did, perhaps it was because they felt  sorry for their little ugly duckling.  And maybe I only imagined  they were especially nice to me.  Maybe they were that nice to  everyone.  Perhaps they were nice to me just to have me around  handy when they needed me to help them just a little bit.    This latter seems to be the most reasonable argument, after  considering some of my stupid exploits and my senseless reasoning  throughout my life.    Yet, it just might be possible that they were partial to me on  account of the wen, and later on, my paralysis--these factors  coupled with the fact that within the last four years along about  the time I was born, they had suffered the loss of a two-year-old  son, a two-week-old daughter, Mama's favorite brother, Hugh, and  Grandpa Johnson.    Who can measure the thoughts of loving parents as they view their  newborn child for the first time, anxious to know whether he or  she is beautiful and healthy and without blemish.    And who knows the anxiety of parents who, after seeing their  child with blemish, must wonder how his condition will affect his  relationship with others, how it will affect his outlook on life,  and whether it might grow worse and shorten his days.          CHAPTER 4    SOCIAL LIVING; LOVING, LISTENING, LEARNING    There were so many little stories unfolding simultaneously that I  am going to be unable to keep them all up to date as I go along.  While I have been telling about some of our working habits and  our little family customs, I find that the story of my love life  has been neglected.  I must go back a way now and bring some of  my social living up to date.    Oh, yes!  I had a sweetheart.  Her name was Gladys, and I must  tell you about her.    You see, when we moved to the Exum farm, I was a little boy  barely five years old.  But then, when we had lived there a year  and a half, I was no longer just a little kid.  I was getting to  be a big boy, six and a half and going on seven.  And my ears  were getting bigger also.  I began to hear about sweethearts.  Susie was thirteen and was just the very one to explain it to me.    She told me once, jokingly, \"A sweetheart is a chicken heart  baked in molasses.\"    But seriously, what she explained about sweethearts amounted to  something like this, \"Sweethearts are one boy and one girl about  the same age who like each other and like to go together and like  to do things together.  He is her sweetheart and she is his  sweetheart.\"    Now the Flints, who had moved onto our old farm, had a bunch of  boys and girls and we all played together.  The one I liked best  was Gladys.  She was just my size, she was six years old, and she  and I liked to go play together.  So, when I learned what  sweethearts were, I knew for a fact that Gladys was my sweetheart  because we liked each other and played together.    Of course, I didn't tell anyone, not even Gladys.  I didn't feel  any differently toward her.  We just went right on playing  together as we had been doing.  But I had this newly acquired  knowledge that she was my sweetheart.    No more than I knew or could understand about it all, I wondered  why boys and girls had sweethearts at all.  They were just like  other boys and girls except they were your own age.    I never heard of any parents who objected to their older boys and  girls having sweethearts and dating.  (In those days we called it  \"going together.\") But in our immediate community, there were  some "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54331"],[0,"Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown (#8)"],[1,"Elder was invited to my aunt's house and was granted permission to  preach on Sunday in their oak-grove, while several of the religiously  inclined followed him to his stopping place and plied him with  questions.    As to myself, it seemed that I had not only heard it thunder, but I  had seen the lightning and felt it through every fibre of my system,  from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet. I was revived as  the showers of heaven revive the parched earth and impart life to  the languishing vegetation. Notwithstanding the fact that I knew  the Latter-day Saints, or Mormons, were looked upon as filth, in  fact as even worse than rubbish, that they had been called the very  off-scourings of the earth, that they were regarded as deserving to be  put to death, yet from that very day I received their doctrine in or by  the spirit.    Now that sixty years have rolled by since the events here narrated;  that I have passed through mobbings, robbings, fines and penalties;  have been banished and once sentenced to death; Paul-like have fought  with wild beasts, have been shipwrecked and almost starved; have  famished on thirsty deserts; have had the scalping-knife wielded over  my head while the Indian warwhoop saluted my ears and the savage  warrior danced with tomahawk in hand, exulting over the victim intended  to be slain and scalped in trophy of victory; have laid in dungeons  for my religion's sake--thanks be to God that I yet live and bear a  faithful testimony of the truth and spirit that possessed my soul from  that first Gospel sermon I ever heard. I have listened to ministers of  various Christian denominations advocate good and virtuous principles,  but I never knew any of them to preach the fullness of the Gospel of  the Lord Jesus as did that humble Mormon Elder.        CHAPTER II.    PERSECUTED BY PLAYMATES--GIVE THEM AN EFFECTIVE CHECK--FIGHT  WITH WILD BEASTS--PARENTS JOIN THE MORMONS--THE AUTHOR HOLDS  BACK--ASSASSINATION OF JOSEPH AND HYRUM SMITH--MORMONS LEAVE ILLINOIS  FOR THE WEST--EXCITING TIMES--MY WINTER'S WORK--FATHER DECIDES TO  WAIT A WHILE BEFORE LEAVING ILLLNOIS--MY DETERMINATION TO GO WITH THE  MORMONS--CONFIDE A SECRET TO MY MOTHER--A NEW CONSULTATIONS--CHANGE IN  THE FAMILY PLANS--FATHER PREPARES TO START--GIVES ME PERMISSION TO  GO--THINKS OF LEAVING ME BECAUSE OF MY ILLNESS--I FEEL TO PREFER DEATH  TO BEING LEFT BEHIND.    FROM the very day my parents entertained the Latter-day Saint Elders in  their house my former playmates in the neighborhood commenced a crusade  on me, calling me a Mormon, and many hard names, whenever they met me.  When we gathered at the mill pond, our usual place of bathing, they  would baptize me, as they called it, in the name of Beelzebub; but I  called it drowning, for it seemed to me that when three or four of them  got me under the water they never knew when to let me up. Then when I  got out of the water they would mockingly \"lay hands\" on me in the name  of Beelzebub, going through a ceremony and at short intervals calling  \"Pluck,\" when they would pull my hair with a severe twitch, and would  spit on me and laugh. Once my clothes were taken and thrown into a bed  of itching nettles, and when I tried to get them out with a pole I was  pushed in among the nettles. At the gristmill, also, they would punish  me in a shameful manner. At last I became so provoked that I went after  them with a strong jack-knife. Though some of them were eighteen or  nineteen years old, they ran off, fully convinced that I would have  hurt them if I could have caught them. The miller interposed and gave  them a severe reprimand. From that time they never tried to punish  me. My medicine had worked well, and thereafter I was looked on as a  leading boy among them.    During this period I had some perilous experiences with wild animals.  My father had a pet deer, and a bulldog owned by the family caught  it by the nose; I tried to get the dog off, when the frightened  deer kicked and tore my clothes almost off, lacerating my flesh  considerably. Soon after this the deer was followed, in the woods near  the house, by a large buck, which my father shot. The animal's shoulder  was broken, and I followed it to the millpond and sprang into the water  to hold it. As I seized its horn the buck, which had a footing, threw  me around, lacerating my left hand considerably. For a time my life  was in peril from the wild animal, but I struggled and finally used my  pocket knife on its throat. Some time after this episode a man named  John Bos shot and wounded a big buck near our home. It being night, he  came to the house for assistance, and father and I went out. The dogs  reached the buck, which charged on them, and as it was seized by the  nose by one of them father and I caught the buck's hind feet. It kicked  us free, and I had a close call from being severely if not fatally  hurt; but we returned to the attack, and finally secured the game.    As time went on the older people in our neighborhood took interest in  the Mormon Elders, and some of them joined the new Church, while others  became very intolerant and hostile. My parents and my eldest brother  and sister united with the Mormons; yet I held back, for though fully  in sympathy with what my relatives had done I did not consider myself  worthy to join, for I thought that to be a church member I must have  some great experience and see great lights, such as I had heard people  testify of. Thus I stayed out and watched developments.    Finally, in July, 1844, the news reached us that the Prophet Joseph  Smith and his brother Hyrum, the Patriarch, had been assassinated  in Carthage jail by a mob; also, that the Mormons had been ordered  to leave the state, and were going either to the Rocky Mountains,  California, or Vancouver Island. In fact, there were many kinds of  rumors afloat, and there was great excitement.    In the fall of 1845 permission was given me to go to a river town five  miles from home, to work at a slaughter and packing house, where my  cousin, Homer Jackson, and I got employment that season. We heard that  the Mormons were going to start west the next spring--in fact, their  purpose was a topic of frequent conversation. We returned home in the  latter part of January, 1846, and soon learned that the Church leaders  were leaving Nauvoo for a new home in the unknown western wilds, and  that every true Mormon was expected to join them as soon as possible.    Shortly after this, father called a family meeting to consider what  to do. It was a great venture to start out with a large family on  a journey of a thousand miles or more into an unknown wilderness,  among savage tribes; so after long discussion of the matter, it was  decided to be too great an undertaking at that particular time. It was  regarded as inadvisable to take the chances of starving to death in the  wilderness. Besides, property was very low, and it was folly to sell  out a good home at so great a sacrifice as seemed necessary.    When this decision was reached, father turned to me and said: \"Well,  Jimmy, what do you think about it?\" I answered that where the Mormons  went I would go, and where they died I would die. This was the first  time I had been asked a question, and as I was not a member of the  Church my reply surprised the others. Being inquired of as to how I  would go, I suggested that perhaps someone wanted a teamster, or maybe  there was some widow who would take a boy for his labor in return  for food and clothing. Father asked if I would leave the family and  go out west and starve; and he suggested that as I did not belong to  the Mormons they would not have me. To this I said I would join them,  and that my mind was made up to go with the Mormons at all hazards.  Then father ordered me to keep quiet, saying he would thrash me if I  talked of leaving home. This closed the discussion, for in those days  thrashing was the great panacea for disobedience, whether at home or  in the school room. But that threat clinched my resolve to go with the  Mormons even at the risk of life, for I was thoroughly satisfied of the  justice of their cause.    I said no more then, but at the first opportunity told my mother that  soon I would come up missing, as I was going with the Mormons, and  should hide if searched for, if I had to go among the Indians. Mother  said I would starve, but my reply was that I could live on what others  did. My mother was convinced that I would go, and her mother's heart  was as so touched that she could not withhold my secret from my father,  who believed, too, that I would do as I had said.    One evening, soon afterward, I overheard them talking of the matter.  Father said it would break up the family if they did not move west, for  Jim certainly would go; they were satisfied that the Mormon doctrines  were true, and thought that perhaps they had better make an effort to  sell out and move. My heart was filled with joy at these words.    When morning came, father set out to buy oxen, and was successful. He  also sold his farm but reserved the crop, as he had to wait till after  harvest for part of his pay for the land. He thought that by fitting  out two good teams, and providing wagons and tools, he and Alexander  Stephens (mother's brother) and two of his sisters (old maids), and  myself could go out into Iowa, where we could put in some corn and  build a cabin or two. Then my uncle and I could do the rest while  father returned, took care of the harvest, and brought up the family,  when we would follow the Church as best we could until a resting place  was found.    The way now seemed open. My father felt encouraged, and all went well  until a few days before the time for starting, when I was stricken down  with fever and ague, and shook or chilled every other day till the  first of May, at which time all was ready for moving. Efforts were made  to persuade me that I could not stand the"]]]
