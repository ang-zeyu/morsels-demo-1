They were very happy indeed as they  strolled up the shady walks and looked upon the gorgeous flowers and  shrubs, feeling that their new home was more beautiful than any tongue  could describe.    Suddenly, as they turned a corner and walked through a gap in a high  hedge, they came face to face with an enormous Lion, which crouched  upon the green lawn and seemed surprised by their appearance.    They stopped short, Uncle Henry trembling with horror and Aunt Em too  terrified to scream.  Next moment the poor woman clasped her husband  around the neck and cried:    \"Save me, Henry, save me!\"    \"Can't even save myself, Em,\" he returned, in a husky voice, \"for the  animile looks as if it could eat both of us an' lick its chops for  more!  If I only had a gun--\"    \"Haven't you, Henry?  Haven't you?\" she asked anxiously.    \"Nary gun, Em.  So let's die as brave an' graceful as we can.  I knew  our luck couldn't last!\"    \"I won't die.  I won't be eaten by a lion!\" wailed Aunt Em, glaring  upon the huge beast.  Then a thought struck her, and she whispered,  \"Henry, I've heard as savage beastses can be conquered by the human  eye.  I'll eye that lion out o' countenance an' save our lives.\"    \"Try it, Em,\" he returned, also in a whisper.  \"Look at him as you do  at me when I'm late to dinner.\"    Aunt Em turned upon the Lion a determined countenance and a wild  dilated eye.  She glared at the immense beast steadily, and the Lion,  who had been quietly blinking at them, began to appear uneasy and  disturbed.    \"Is anything the matter, ma'am?\" he asked, in a mild voice.    At this speech from the terrible beast Aunt Em and Uncle Henry both  were startled, and then Uncle Henry remembered that this must be the  Lion they had seen in Ozma's Throne Room.    \"Hold on, Em!\" he exclaimed.  \"Quit the eagle eye conquest an' take  courage.  I guess this is the same Cowardly Lion Dorothy has told us  about.\"    \"Oh, is it?\" she cried, much relieved.    \"When he spoke, I got the idea; and when he looked so 'shamed like, I  was sure of it,\" Uncle Henry continued.    Aunt Em regarded the animal with new interest.    \"Are you the Cowardly Lion?\" she inquired.  \"Are you Dorothy's friend?\"    \"Yes'm,\" answered the Lion, meekly.  \"Dorothy and I are old chums and  are very fond of each other.  I'm the King of Beasts, you know, and the  Hungry Tiger and I serve Princess Ozma as her body guards.\"    \"To be sure,\" said Aunt Em, nodding.  \"But the King of Beasts shouldn't  be cowardly.\"    \"I've heard that said before,\" remarked the Lion, yawning till he  showed two great rows of sharp white teeth; \"but that does not keep me  from being frightened whenever I go into battle.\"    \"What do you do, run?\" asked Uncle Henry.    \"No; that would be foolish, for the enemy would run after me,\" declared  the Lion.  \"So I tremble with fear and pitch in as hard as I can; and  so far I have always won my fight.\"    \"Ah, I begin to understand,\" said Uncle Henry.    \"Were you scared when I looked at you just now?\" inquired Aunt Em.    \"Terribly scared, madam,\" answered the Lion, \"for at first I thought  you were going to have a fit.  Then I noticed you were trying to  overcome me by the power of your eye, and your glance was so fierce and  penetrating that I shook with fear.\"    This greatly pleased the lady, and she said quite cheerfully:    \"Well, I won't hurt you, so don't be scared any more.  I just wanted to  see what the human eye was good for.\"    \"The human eye is a fearful weapon,\" remarked the Lion, scratching his  nose softly with his paw to hide a smile.  \"Had I not known you were  Dorothy's friends I might have torn you both into shreds in order to  escape your terrible gaze.\"    Aunt Em shuddered at hearing this, and Uncle Henry said hastily:    \"I'm glad you knew us.  Good morning, Mr. Lion; we'll hope to see you  again--by and by--some time in the future.\"    \"Good morning,\" replied the Lion, squatting down upon the lawn again.  \"You are likely to see a good deal of me, if you live in the Land of  Oz.\"        8.  How the Grand Gallipoot Joined The Nomes    After leaving the Whimsies, Guph continued on his journey and  penetrated far into the Northwest.  He wanted to get to the Country of  the Growleywogs, and in order to do that he must cross the Ripple Land,  which was a hard thing to do.  For the Ripple Land was a succession of  hills and valleys, all very steep and rocky, and they changed places  constantly by rippling.  While Guph was climbing a hill it sank down  under him and became a valley, and while he was descending into a  valley it rose up and carried him to the top of a hill.  This was very  perplexing to the traveler, and a stranger might have thought he could  never cross the Ripple Land at all.  But Guph knew that if he kept  steadily on he would get to the end at last; so he paid no attention to  the changing hills and valleys and plodded along as calmly as if  walking upon the level ground.    The result of this wise persistence was that the General finally  reached firmer soil and, after penetrating a dense forest, came to the  Dominion of the Growleywogs.    No sooner had he crossed the border of this domain when two guards  seized him and carried him before the Grand Gallipoot of the  Growleywogs, who scowled upon him ferociously and asked him why he  dared intrude upon his territory.    \"I'm the Lord High General of the Invincible Army of the Nomes, and my  name is Guph,\" was the reply.  \"All the world trembles when that name  is mentioned.\"    The Growleywogs gave a shout of jeering laughter at this, and one of  them caught the Nome in his strong arms and tossed him high into the  air.  Guph was considerably shaken when he fell upon the hard ground,  but he appeared to take no notice of the impertinence and composed  himself to speak again to the Grand Gallipoot.    \"My master, King Roquat the Red, has sent me here to confer with you.  He wishes your assistance to conquer the Land of Oz.\"    Here the General paused, and the Grand Gallipoot scowled upon him more  terribly than ever and said:    \"Go on!\"    The voice of the Grand Gallipoot was partly a roar and partly a growl.  He mumbled his words badly and Guph had to listen carefully in order to  understand him.    These Growleywogs were certainly remarkable creatures.  They were of  gigantic size, yet were all bone and skin and muscle, there being no  meat or fat upon their bodies at all.  Their powerful muscles lay just  underneath their skins, like bunches of tough rope, and the weakest  Growleywog was so strong that he could pick up an elephant and toss it  seven miles away.    It seems unfortunate that strong people are usually so disagreeable and  overbearing that no one cares for them.  In fact, to be different from  your fellow creatures is always a misfortune.  The Growleywogs knew  that they were disliked and avoided by every one, so they had become  surly and unsociable even among themselves.  Guph knew that they hated  all people, including the Nomes; but he hoped to win them over,  nevertheless, and knew that if he succeeded they would afford him very  powerful assistance.    \"The Land of Oz is ruled by a namby-pamby girl who is disgustingly kind  and good,\" he continued.  \"Her people are all happy and contented and  have no care or worries whatever.\"    \"Go on!\" growled the Grand Gallipoot.    \"Once the Nome King enslaved the Royal Family of Ev--another  goody-goody lot that we detest,\" said the General.  \"But Ozma  interfered, although it was none of her business, and marched her army  against us.  With her was a Kansas girl named Dorothy, and a Yellow  Hen, and they marched directly into the Nome King's cavern.  There they  liberated our slaves from Ev and stole King Roquat's Magic Belt, which  they carried away with them.  So now our King is making a tunnel under  the deadly desert, so we can march through it to the Emerald City.  When we get there we mean to conquer and destroy all the land and  recapture the Magic Belt.\"    Again he paused, and again the Grand Gallipoot growled:    \"Go on!\"    Guph tried to think what to say next, and a happy thought soon occurred  to him.    \"We want you to help us in this conquest,\" he announced, \"for we need  the mighty aid of the Growleywogs in order to make sure that we shall  not be defeated.  You are the strongest people in all the world, and  you hate good and happy creatures as much as we Nomes do.  I am sure it  will be a real pleasure to you to tear down the beautiful Emerald City,  and in return for your valuable assistance we will allow you to bring  back to your country ten thousand people of Oz, to be your slaves.\"    \"Twenty thousand!\" growled the Grand Gallipoot.    \"All right, we promise you twenty thousand,\" agreed the General.    The Gallipoot made a signal and at once his attendants picked up  General Guph and carried him away to a prison, where the jailer amused  himself by sticking pins in the round fat body of the old Nome, to see  him jump and hear him yell.    But while this was going on the Grand Gallipoot was talking with his  counselors, who were the most important officials of the Growleywogs.  When he had stated to them the proposition of the Nome King, he said:    \"My advice is to offer to help them.  Then, when we have conquered the  Land of Oz, we will take not only our twenty thousand prisoners but all  the gold and jewels we want.\"    \"Let us take the Magic Belt, too,\" suggested one counselor.    \"And rob the Nome King and make him our slave,\" said another.    \"That is a good idea,\" declared the Grand Gallipoot.  \"I'd like King  Roquat for my own slave.  He could black my boots and bring me my  porridge every morning while I am in bed.\"    \"There"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5173"],[0,"The Religion of the Samurai (#8)"],[1,"of Hoh (Katsu); that Nan Tsuen killed a cat at  a single stroke of his knife in the presence of his disciples; and  that Teh Shan so frequently struck questioners with his staff.[FN#55]   The Zen Activity was displayed by the Chinese teachers making use of  diverse things such as the staff, the brush[FN#56] of long hair, the  mirror, the rosary, the cup, the pitcher, the flag, the moon, the  sickle, the plough, the bow and arrow, the ball, the bell, the drum,  the cat, the dog, the duck, the earthworm--in short, any and  everything that was fit for the occasion and convenient for the  purpose.  Thus Zen Activity was of pure Chinese origin, and it was  developed after the Sixth Patriarch.[FN#57]  For this reason the  period previous to the Sixth Patriarch may be called the Age of the  Zen Doctrine, while that posterior to the same master, the Age of the  Zen Activity.      [FN#55]  A long official staff (Shu-jo) like the crosier carried by  the abbot of the monastery.    [FN#56]  An ornamental brush (Hos-su) often carried by Zen teachers.    [FN#57]  The giving of a slap was first tried by the Sixth Patriarch,  who struck one of his disciples, known as Ho Tseh (Ka-taku), and it  was very frequently resorted to by the later masters.  The lifting up  of the brush was first tried by Tsing Yuen in an interview with his  eldest disciple, Shih Ten, and it became a fashion among other  teachers.  The loud outcry of Hoh was first made use of by Ma Tsu,  the successor of Nan Yoh.  In this way the origin of the Zen Activity  can easily be traced to the Sixth Patriarch and his direct disciples.   After the Sung dynasty Chinese Zen masters seem to have given undue  weight to the Activity, and neglected the serious study of the  doctrine.  This brought out the degeneration severely reproached by  some of the Japanese Zen teachers.        15. Decline of Zen.    The blooming prosperity of Zen was over towards the end of the  Southern Sung dynasty (1127-1279), when it began to fade, not being  bitten by the frost of oppression from without, but being weakened by  rottenness within.  As early as the Sung dynasty (960-1126) the  worship of Buddha Amitabha[FN#58] stealthily found its way among Zen  believers, who could not fully realize the Spirit of Shakya Muni, and  to satisfy these people the amalgamation of the two faiths was  attempted by some Zen masters.[FN#59]    [FN#58]  The faith is based on Larger Sukhavati-vyuha, Smaller  Sukhavati-vyuha, and Amitayus-dhyana-sutra.  It was taught in India  by Acvaghosa, Nagariuna, and Vasubandhu.  In China Hwui Yuen (E-on,  died in A.D. 416), Tan Lwan (Don-ran, died in 542), Tao Choh  (Do-shaku), and Shen Tao (Zen-do) (both of whom lived about 600-650),  chiefly taught the doctrine.  It made an extraordinary progress in  Japan, and differentiated itself into several sects, of which Jodo  Shu and Shin Shu are the strongest.    [FN#59]  It is beyond all doubt that Poh Loh Tien (Haku-raku-ten)  practised Zen, but at the same time believed in Amitabha; so also Su  Shih (So-shoku), a most noted Zen practiser, worshipped the same  Buddha, Yang Kieh (Yo-keteu), who carried a picture of Amitabha  wherever he went and worshipped it, seems to have thought there is  nothing incompatible between Zen and his faith.  The foremost of  those Zen masters of the Sung dynasty that attempted the amalgamation  is Yung Ming (Yo-myo, died in 975), who reconciled Zen with the  worship of Amitabha in his Wan Shen Tung Kwei Tsih  (Man-zen-do-ki-shu) and Si Ngan Yan Shan Fu (Sei-an-yo-sin-fu).  He  was followed by Tsing Tsz (Jo-ji) and Chan Hieh (Shin-ketsu, lived  about 1151), the former of whom wrote Kwei Yuen Chih Chi  (Ki-gen-jiki-shi), and the latter Tsing Tu Sin Yao (Jo-do-sin-yo), in  order to further the tendency.  In the Yuen dynasty Chung Fung  (Chu-ho, died in 1323) encouraged the adoration of Amitabha, together  with the practice of Zen, in his poetical composition  (Kwan-shu-jo-go).  In the Ming dynasty Yun Si (Un-sei, died in 1615),  the author of Shen Kwan Tseh Tsin (Zen-kwan-saku-shin) and other  numerous works, writing a commentary on Sukhavati-vyuha-sutra,  brought the amalgamation to its height.  Ku Shan (Ku-zan, died in  1657), a Zen historian and author, and his prominent disciple Wei Lin  (E-rin), axe well known as the amalgamators.  Yun Ming declared that  those who practise Zen, but have no faith in Amitabha, go astray in  nine cases out of ten; that those who do not practise Zen, but  believe in Amitabha, are saved, one and all; that those who practise  Zen, and have the faith in Amitabha, are like the tiger provided with  wings; and that for those who have no faith in Amitabha, nor practise  Zen, there exist the iron floor and the copper pillars in Hell.  Ku  Shan said that some practise Zen in order to attain Enlightenment,  while others pray Amitabha for salvation; that if they were sincere  and diligent, both will obtain the final beatitude.  Wei Lin also  observed: \"Theoretically I embrace Zen, and practically I worship  Amitabha.\"  E-chu, the author of Zen-to-nenbutsu ('On Zen and the  Worship of Amitabha'), points out that one of the direct disciples of  the Sixth Patriarch favoured the faith of Amitabha, but there is no  trustworthy evidence, as far as we know, that proves the existence of  the amalgamation in the Tang dynasty.      This tendency steadily increasing with time brought out at length the  period of amalgamation which covered the Yuen (1280-1367) and the  Ming dynasties (1368-1659), when the prayer for Amitabha was in every  mouth of Zen monks sitting in Meditation.  The patrons of Zen were  not wanting in the Yuen dynasty, for such a warlike monarch as the  Emperor Shi Tsu (Sei-so), 1280-1294) is known to have practised Zen  under the instruction of Miao Kao, and his successor Ching Tsung  (1295-1307) to have trusted in Yih Shan,[FN#60] a Zen teacher of  reputation at that time.  Moreover, Lin Ping Chung (Rin-hei-cha, died  in 1274), a powerful minister under Shi Tsu, who did much toward the  establishment of the administrative system in that dynasty, had been  a Zen monk, and never failed to patronize his faith.  And in the Ming  dynasty the first Emperor Tai Tsu (1368-1398), having been a Zen  monk, protected the sect with enthusiasm, and his example was  followed by Tai Tsung (1403-1424), whose spiritual as well as  political adviser was Tao Yen, a Zen monk of distinction.  Thus Zen  exercised an influence unparalleled by any other faith throughout  these ages.  The life and energy of Zen, however, was gone by the  ignoble amalgamation, and even such great scholars as Chung  Fung,[FN#61] Yung Si,[FN#62] Yung Kioh,[FN#63] were not free from the  overwhelming influence of the age.      [FN#60]  The Emperor sent him to Japan in 1299 with some secret  order, but he did nothing political, and stayed as a Zen teacher  until his death.    [FN#61]  A most renowned Zen master in the Yuen dynasty, whom the  Emperor Jan Tsung invited to visit the palace, but in vain.    [FN#62]  An author noted for his learning and virtues, who was rather  a worshipper of Amitabha than a Zen monk.    [FN#63]  An author of voluminous books, of which Tung Shang Ku Cheh  (To-jo-ko-tetsu) is well known.      We are not, however, doing justice to the tendency of amalgamation in  these times simply to blame it for its obnoxious results, because it  is beyond doubt that it brought forth wholesome fruits to the Chinese  literature and philosophy.  Who can deny that this tendency brought  the Speculative[FN#64] philosophy of the Sung dynasty to its  consummation by the amalgamation of Confucianism with Buddhism  especially with Zen, to enable it to exercise long-standing influence  on society, and that this tendency also produced Wang Yang  Ming,[FN#65] one of the greatest generals and scholars that the world  has ever seen, whose philosophy of Conscience[FN#66] still holds a  unique position in the history of human thought?  Who can deny  furthermore that Wang's philosophy is Zen in the Confucian  terminology?      [FN#64]  This well-known philosophy was first taught by Cheu Men Shuh  (Shu-mo-shiku, died in 1073) in its definite form.  He is said to  have been enlightened by the instruction of Hwui Tang, a contemporary  Zen master.  He was succeeded by Chang Ming Tao (Tei-mei-do, died in  1085) and Chang I Chwen (Tei-i-sen, died in 1107), two brothers, who  developed the philosophy in no small degree.  And it was completed by  Chu Tsz (Shu-shi, died in 1200), a celebrated commentator of the  Confucian classics.  It is worthy to note that these scholars  practised Meditation just as Zen monks.  See 'History of Chinese  Philosophy' (pp. 215-269), by G. Nakauchi, and 'History of  Development of Chinese Thought,' by R. Endo.    [FN#65]  He was born in 1472, and died in 1529.  His doctrine  exercised a most fruitful influence on many of the great Japanese  minds, and undoubtedly has done much to the progress of New Japan.

[FN#67]  The Lin Tsi school was started by Nan Yoh, a prominent  disciple of the Sixth Patriarch, and completed by Lin Tsi or Rin Zai.      The introduction of Zen into the island empire is dated as early as  the seventh century;[FN#68] but it was in 1191 that it was first  established by Ei-sai, a man of bold, energetic nature.  He crossed  the sea for China at the age of twenty-eight in 1168, after his  profound study of the whole Tripitaka[FN#69] for eight years in the  Hi-yei Monastery[FN#70] the then centre of Japanese Buddhism.      [FN#68]  Zen was first introduced into Japan by Do sha (629-700) as  early as 653-656, at the time when the Fifth Patriarch just entered  his patriarchal career.  Do-sho went over to China in 653, and met  with Huen Tsang, the celebrated and great scholar, who"]]]
