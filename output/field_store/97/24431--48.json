It is an abuse of terms to give it that appellation; and we may as  well speak of limited extension without figure, or of number without  composition.    Pray consider, said PHILO, whom you are at present inveighing against.  You are honouring with the appellation of Atheist all the sound, orthodox  divines, almost, who have treated of this subject; and you will at last  be, yourself, found, according to your reckoning, the only sound Theist  in the world. But if idolaters be Atheists, as, I think, may justly be  asserted, and Christian Theologians the same, what becomes of the  argument, so much celebrated, derived from the universal consent of  mankind?    But because I know you are not much swayed by names and authorities, I  shall endeavour to show you, a little more distinctly, the inconveniences  of that Anthropomorphism, which you have embraced; and shall prove, that  there is no ground to suppose a plan of the world to be formed in the  Divine mind, consisting of distinct ideas, differently arranged, in the  same manner as an architect forms in his head the plan of a house which  he intends to execute.    It is not easy, I own, to see what is gained by this supposition, whether  we judge of the matter by Reason or by Experience. We are still obliged  to mount higher, in order to find the cause of this cause, which you had  assigned as satisfactory and conclusive.    If Reason (I mean abstract reason, derived from inquiries a priori) be  not alike mute with regard to all questions concerning cause and effect,  this sentence at least it will venture to pronounce, That a mental world,  or universe of ideas, requires a cause as much, as does a material world,  or universe of objects; and, if similar in its arrangement, must require  a similar cause. For what is there in this subject, which should occasion  a different conclusion or inference? In an abstract view, they are  entirely alike; and no difficulty attends the one supposition, which is  not common to both of them.    Again, when we will needs force Experience to pronounce some sentence,  even on these subjects which lie beyond her sphere, neither can she  perceive any material difference in this particular, between these two  kinds of worlds; but finds them to be governed by similar principles, and  to depend upon an equal variety of causes in their operations. We have  specimens in miniature of both of them. Our own mind resembles the one; a  vegetable or animal body the other. Let experience, therefore, judge from  these samples. Nothing seems more delicate, with regard to its causes,  than thought; and as these causes never operate in two persons after the  same manner, so we never find two persons who think exactly alike. Nor  indeed does the same person think exactly alike at any two different  periods of time. A difference of age, of the disposition of his body, of  weather, of food, of company, of books, of passions; any of these  particulars, or others more minute, are sufficient to alter the curious  machinery of thought, and communicate to it very different movements and  operations. As far as we can judge, vegetables and animal bodies are not  more delicate in their motions, nor depend upon a greater variety or more  curious adjustment of springs and principles.    How, therefore, shall we satisfy ourselves concerning the cause of that  Being whom you suppose the Author of Nature, or, according to your system  of Anthropomorphism, the ideal world, into which you trace the material?  Have we not the same reason to trace that ideal world into another ideal  world, or new intelligent principle? But if we stop, and go no further;  why go so far? why not stop at the material world? How can we satisfy  ourselves without going on in infinitum? And, after all, what  satisfaction is there in that infinite progression? Let us remember the  story of the Indian philosopher and his elephant. It was never more  applicable than to the present subject. If the material world rests upon  a similar ideal world, this ideal world must rest upon some other; and so  on, without end. It were better, therefore, never to look beyond the  present material world. By supposing it to contain the principle of its  order within itself, we really assert it to be God; and the sooner we  arrive at that Divine Being, so much the better. When you go one step  beyond the mundane system, you only excite an inquisitive humour which it  is impossible ever to satisfy.    To say, that the different ideas which compose the reason of the Supreme  Being, fall into order of themselves, and by their own nature, is really  to talk without any precise meaning. If it has a meaning, I would fain  know, why it is not as good sense to say, that the parts of the material  world fall into order of themselves and by their own nature. Can the one  opinion be intelligible, while the other is not so?    We have, indeed, experience of ideas which fall into order of themselves,  and without any known cause. But, I am sure, we have a much larger  experience of matter which does the same; as, in all instances of  generation and vegetation, where the accurate analysis of the cause  exceeds all human comprehension. We have also experience of particular  systems of thought and of matter which have no order; of the first in  madness, of the second in corruption. Why, then, should we think, that  order is more essential to one than the other? And if it requires a cause  in both, what do we gain by your system, in tracing the universe of  objects into a similar universe of ideas? The first step which we make  leads us on for ever. It were, therefore, wise in us to limit all our  inquiries to the present world, without looking further. No satisfaction  can ever be attained by these speculations, which so far exceed the  narrow bounds of human understanding.    It was usual with the PERIPATETICS, you know, CLEANTHES, when the cause  of any phenomenon was demanded, to have recourse to their faculties or  occult qualities; and to say, for instance, that bread nourished by its  nutritive faculty, and senna purged by its purgative. But it has been  discovered, that this subterfuge was nothing but the disguise of  ignorance; and that these philosophers, though less ingenuous, really  said the same thing with the sceptics or the vulgar, who fairly confessed  that they knew not the cause of these phenomena. In like manner, when it  is asked, what cause produces order in the ideas of the Supreme Being;  can any other reason be assigned by you, Anthropomorphites, than that it  is a rational faculty, and that such is the nature of the Deity? But why  a similar answer will not be equally satisfactory in accounting for the  order of the world, without having recourse to any such intelligent  creator as you insist on, may be difficult to determine. It is only to  say, that such is the nature of material objects, and that they are all  originally possessed of a faculty of order and proportion. These are only  more learned and elaborate ways of confessing our ignorance; nor has the  one hypothesis any real advantage above the other, except in its greater  conformity to vulgar prejudices.    You have displayed this argument with great emphasis, replied CLEANTHES:  You seem not sensible how easy it is to answer it. Even in common life,  if I assign a cause for any event, is it any objection, PHILO, that I  cannot assign the cause of that cause, and answer every new question  which may incessantly be started? And what philosophers could possibly  submit to so rigid a rule? philosophers, who confess ultimate causes to  be totally unknown; and are sensible, that the most refined principles  into which they trace the phenomena, are still to them as inexplicable as  these phenomena themselves are to the vulgar. The order and arrangement  of nature, the curious adjustment of final causes, the plain use and  intention of every part and organ; all these bespeak in the clearest  language an intelligent cause or author. The heavens and the earth join  in the same testimony: The whole chorus of Nature raises one hymn to the  praises of its Creator. You alone, or almost alone, disturb this general  harmony. You start abstruse doubts, cavils, and objections: You ask me,  what is the cause of this cause? I know not; I care not; that concerns  not me. I have found a Deity; and here I stop my inquiry. Let those go  further, who are wiser or more enterprising.    I pretend to be neither, replied PHILO: And for that very reason, I  should never perhaps have attempted to go so far; especially when I am  sensible, that I must at last be contented to sit down with the same  answer, which, without further trouble, might have satisfied me from the  beginning. If I am still to remain in utter ignorance of causes, and can  absolutely give an explication of nothing, I shall never esteem it any  advantage to shove off for a moment a difficulty, which, you acknowledge,  must immediately, in its full force, recur upon me. Naturalists indeed  very justly explain particular effects by more general causes, though  these general causes themselves should remain in the end totally  inexplicable; but they never surely thought it satisfactory to explain a  particular effect by a particular cause, which was no more to be  accounted for than the effect itself. An ideal system, arranged of  itself, without a precedent design, is not a whit more explicable than a  material one, which attains its order in a like manner; nor is there any  more difficulty in the latter supposition than in the former.          PART 5      But to show you still more inconveniences, continued PHILO, in your  Anthropomorphism, please to take a new survey of your principles. Like  effects prove like causes.

Flesh and blood cannot reveal spiritual  things, but our Father in heaven. The things of the spirit require  the same spirit to discern them. He that is spiritual can judge all  things, while he that has not the spirit of revelation cannot judge any  spiritual matters correctly, of any name or nature.

Your obedient servant,    ORSON SPENCER.        LETTER III.    ON FAITH.    _Liverpool, June_ 1, 1847.    Reverend and Dear Sir,--The next subject to which I will invite your  careful consideration, is that of FAITH.    Do not be surprised that I should attempt the investigation of a  subject so common-place, with the view of imparting any new or useful  instruction. The numerous elaborate treatises that have heretofore been  bestowed upon this subject, have, I boldly aver, been like Goliath's  armour against David--massive and imposing, but, at the same time,  alike inapplicable and ineffectual to the case at issue.    In order that you may be apprised of my position, without needless  circumlocution, I here distinctly observe, that there neither is, nor  ever was, any gospel or saving faith, in former or latter days, but  the faith of miracles, or the faith of _immediate revelation_. Can any  man know God without faith? Certainly not. The gospel of Christ is the  power of God unto salvation. To whom? To the unbelieving? No! but to  them that have _faith_. The gospel of Christ is, then, brought only  to such as have faith. But what faith are they to have in order to  receive it? The answer, is the faith of immediate revelation, or of the  supernatural agency of the Holy Spirit.    Now, sir, I ask you to listen a moment, and hear what the voice of  God says to you and me on this subject. The righteousness of God is  _revealed_ from FAITH to FAITH. Here, it is conceived, my position  is invincibly fortified beyond the power of rational conquest. God's  righteous will is _revealed_ to FAITH. It is written, \"The just shall  live by faith.\" By what faith shall the just live? Surely, nothing less  than the faith of immediate revelation. The fact that God's will was  _revealed_ to the faith of the Saints anciently, does not supersede the  necessity of his will being _revealed_ to your faith and to my faith  now.    The ancients could not _believe_ for us; or, in other words, their  faith could not be a substitute for our faith. \"He that believeth not,\"  for himself, \"shall be damned.\" Neither could a revelation to them be  necessarily a _revelation_ to us. A revelation to Noah to build an  ark, is not suited to Abraham, or Peter, or Francis Wayland, or Dr.  Chalmers. No man, in this day, can know that God ever revealed himself  to Noah, or Abraham, unless it is now revealed to him from heaven;  and he cannot know that it is revealed from heaven to him now, unless  he has faith unto himself before God; and this faith which he must  exercise for himself, is the faith of _revelation_, or the faith of  miracles.    What ailed the Judaic churches in Christ's day? They certainly believed  on Moses and Abraham, and made habitual sacrifices in support of  their faith. Paul was a bright example of sincerity and fidelity in  support of the Judaic faith. He verily thought that he ought to do many  things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. But was the faith  of Paul, and of the Judaic church generally, the faith of immediate  revelation or the faith of miracles? By no means. Paul originally,  and his associates in the ministry, believed the Mosaic scriptures  from tradition and education, and not from immediate revelation. They,  indeed, believed that Abraham, and Moses, and Samuel, and Noah, had  the faith of miracles, and enjoyed _immediate revelation_, and the  spirit of prophecy, &c. They believed that such an high order of faith  as prevailed in the Mosaic and prophetic days was no longer necessary.  (But, afterwards, Paul concedes that one in his own state was one in  ignorance and unbelief.)    Hence the spirit of prophecy, spoken of by Joel, as poured out in the  apostolic day, was, in their estimation uncalled for. They supposed  the canon of scripture was sufficiently full, when the prophet Malachi  finished his testimony, and closed up the age of miracles! Men may  sincerely believe the Bible, as many of the sects do believe it,  without having it revealed from heaven that the Bible is true, and it  will never save them. They may believe the Bible even without knowing  God; for the simple reason, that no man can know God without God  reveals himself to him. This was the condition of the Judaic church.  Many of them sincerely believed the Mosaic writings, but detested and  rejected the principle of immediate revelation, by which alone they  could know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom he had sent. If  they had believed heartily in the doctrine of immediate revelation to  all believers, in all ages, they would have known Jesus Christ to be  the Messiah, as well as Moses, or Abraham, who saw his day, and was  glad. On the same principle, dear sir. Christian denominations, in this  day, believe the apostolic scriptures sincerely, and do many things  accordingly; but rejecting the principle of immediate revelation to  them-ward, they neither know Jesus Christ nor his prophet Joseph, nor  the power of God, as it is revealed from faith to faith in our day.    We, sir, contend for the faith of miracles in our own day; but you and  your associates contend against it. The disciples of Jesus contended  for it, in their day; but the professed followers of Moses and Abraham  contended against it. Now, sir, to which of these sides do you belong?  Can you find that any people, who ever contended against the faith of  immediate revelation and miracles, such as was maintained by Samuel,  Abraham, Barak, Daniel, and Noah, ever prospered. Is there a single  instance in scripture, from Genesis to Revelations, where God manifests  any fellowship for any faith short of a faith of miracles and immediate  revelation? If an inferior kind of faith has been got up since the New  Testament age, is it not well to inquire from whence it has sprung, and  what is the scriptural basis of its support? If such an inferior faith  is not _revealed_ from heaven, it must certainly be from beneath, and,  consequently earthly, and sensual, and devilish. If it springs from  the precepts of men, and not from the direct and positive revelation  of God, it ought surely to be abandoned and forsaken at once. When  men believe the Old and New Testament scriptures from tradition, and  the lips of a ministry that is not sent out and called by immediate  revelation from heaven, their faith is dead; and all such as float in  this broad stream of traditionary faith, are not and cannot be built up  as lively stones to offer up spiritual sacrifices to God.    Hence, sir, the concession of Mr. C. G. Finney, and Nettleton, and of  your own Mr. Knapp, all great Revivalists, and talented and devout  men, that the \"sectarian churches need to be converted over again.\"  And I am constrained to add, without any inviduous feelings, that such  teachers themselves need to be converted from a traditionary faith into  the same faith with the ancient worthies spoken of in the eleventh  chapter to the Hebrews. They themselves cannot _know_ God without that  same ancient faith that secured to its possessors revelation from God,  and the power of working miracles, &c. God has never called men to  testify to the truth of the Old and New Testament, unless the truth  has been revealed to them _personally_ from the heavens. When it is  thus revealed, they will obey like the ancient saints, and the power of  godliness will follow their faith, \"even healing the sick, casting out  devils, and speaking with new tongues.\"    You, sir, will surely admit, that the faith of the ancients was  far superior to modern traditionary faith, and was attended with  a power which this latter faith cannot, in its very nature, ever  attain to. By the ancient faith, or faith of immediate revelation,  men wrought righteousness, subdued kingdoms, stopped the mouths of  lions, and quenched the violence of fire--stayed the sun in the  firmament--sealed up the heavens as brass for the space of three years  and a half, or opened the windows thereof for the rain to descend in  showers or torrents, even to a universal deluge. Surely it will be  no disparagement to such exalted names as yours, and that of my old  acquaintance President Barnas Sears, and my former instructor President  E. Knott, to turn, like Paul, to the banner and standard of such a  faith. By such a faith they are prepared to work the works of God; and  either in time or eternity, to work even far greater works than Jesus  ever wrought on the earth, as his own word declares; for, sir, this  kind of faith shall abide beyond the veil; for God himself made the  world by faith, and the spirits of the just work by faith, and obtain  revelation from God, and minister the same to militant believers on  earth, from the faith of the sanctified in light, to the faith of the  militant here below. \"The righteousness of God is revealed from faith  to faith.\" Surely we may count all things but loss for the excellency  of the _knowledge_ of Christ Jesus our Lord; for he that gets the  knowledge of Christ by revelation to himself, and keeps it, shall never  fall.    Do you not preach, sir, the ancient faith spoken of in the eleventh  chapter of Hebrews, for modern believers to imitate? Or is the  miraculous faith of the ancients to be pourtrayed to men in this day,  only as a beautiful picture to be admired by spectators, and not copied  and imitated as a doctrine of modern practice? If there is such a thing  as _common_ faith,"]]]
