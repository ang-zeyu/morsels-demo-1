Thus we seem, upon the whole, to have attained a knowledge of the force  of that principle here insisted on, and can determine what degree  of esteem or moral approbation may result from reflections on public  interest and utility. The necessity of justice to the support of society  is the sole foundation of that virtue; and since no moral excellence  is more highly esteemed, we may conclude that this circumstance of  usefulness has, in general, the strongest energy, and most entire  command over our sentiments. It must, therefore, be the source of  a considerable part of the merit ascribed to humanity, benevolence,  friendship, public spirit, and other social virtues of that stamp; as it  is the sole source of the moral approbation paid to fidelity, justice,  veracity, integrity, and those other estimable and useful qualities and  principles. It is entirely agreeable to the rules of philosophy, and  even of common reason; where any principle has been found to have a  great force and energy in one instance, to ascribe to it a like  energy in all similar instances. This indeed is Newton's chief rule of  philosophizing [Footnote: Principia. Lib. iii.].        SECTION IV.    OF POLITICAL SOCIETY.        Had every man sufficient SAGACITY to perceive, at all times, the strong  interest which binds him to the observance of justice and equity, and  STRENGTH OF MIND sufficient to persevere in a steady adherence to a  general and a distant interest, in opposition to the allurements of  present pleasure and advantage; there had never, in that case, been any  such thing as government or political society, but each man, following  his natural liberty, had lived in entire peace and harmony with all  others. What need of positive law where natural justice is, of itself,  a sufficient restraint? Why create magistrates, where there never arises  any disorder or iniquity? Why abridge our native freedom, when, in every  instance, the utmost exertion of it is found innocent and beneficial?  It is evident, that, if government were totally useless, it never could  have place, and that the sole foundation of the duty of allegiance is  the ADVANTAGE, which it procures to society, by preserving peace and  order among mankind.    When a number of political societies are erected, and maintain a great  intercourse together, a new set of rules are immediately discovered to  be USEFUL in that particular situation; and accordingly take place under  the title of Laws of Nations. Of this kind are, the sacredness of the  person of ambassadors, abstaining from poisoned arms, quarter in war,  with others of that kind, which are plainly calculated for the ADVANTAGE  of states and kingdoms in their intercourse with each other.    The rules of justice, such as prevail among individuals, are not  entirely suspended among political societies. All princes pretend a  regard to the rights of other princes; and some, no doubt, without  hypocrisy. Alliances and treaties are every day made between independent  states, which would only be so much waste of parchment, if they were not  found by experience to have SOME influence and authority. But here is  the difference between kingdoms and individuals. Human nature cannot  by any means subsist, without the association of individuals; and that  association never could have place, were no regard paid to the laws of  equity and justice. Disorder, confusion, the war of all against all, are  the necessary consequences of such a licentious conduct. But nations  can subsist without intercourse. They may even subsist, in some degree,  under a general war. The observance of justice, though useful among  them, is not guarded by so strong a necessity as among individuals;  and the moral obligation holds proportion with the USEFULNESS. All  politicians will allow, and most philosophers, that reasons of state  may, in particular emergencies, dispense with the rules of justice, and  invalidate any treaty or alliance, where the strict observance of  it would be prejudicial, in a considerable degree, to either of the  contracting parties. But nothing less than the most extreme necessity,  it is confessed, can justify individuals in a breach of promise, or an  invasion of the properties of others.    In a confederated commonwealth, such as the Achaean republic of old, or  the Swiss Cantons and United Provinces in modern times; as the league  has here a peculiar UTILITY, the conditions of union have a peculiar  sacredness and authority, and a violation of them would be regarded as  no less, or even as more criminal, than any private injury or injustice.    The long and helpless infancy of man requires the combination of parents  for the subsistence of their young; and that combination requires the  virtue of chastity or fidelity to the marriage bed. Without such a  UTILITY, it will readily be owned, that such a virtue would never have  been thought of.           [Footnote: The only solution, which Plato gives to all the  objections that might be raised against the community of women,  established in his imaginary commonwealth, is, [Greek quotation here].  Scite enim istud et dicitur et dicetur, Id quod utile sit honestum esse,  quod autem inutile sit turpe esse. [De Rep lib v p 457 ex edit Ser]. And  this maxim will admit of no doubt, where public utility is concerned,  which is Plato's meaning. And indeed to what other purpose do all the  ideas of chastity and modesty serve? \"Nisi utile est quod facimus,  frustra est gloria,\" says Phaedrus. [Greek quotation here], says  Plutarch, de vitioso pudore. \"Nihil eorum quae damnosa sunt, pulchrum  est.\" The same was the opinion of the Stoics [Greek quotation here; from  Sept. Emp lib III cap 20].    An infidelity of this nature is much more PERNICIOUS in WOMEN than in  MEN. Hence the laws of chastity are much stricter over the one sex than  over the other.    These rules have all a reference to generation; and yet women past  child-bearing are no more supposed to be exempted from them than  those in the flower of their youth and beauty. GENERAL RULES are often  extended beyond the principle whence they first arise; and this in all  matters of taste and sentiment. It is a vulgar story at Paris, that,  during the rage of the Mississippi, a hump-backed fellow went every  day into the Rue de Quincempoix, where the stock-jobbers met in great  crowds, and was well paid for allowing them to make use of his hump as a  desk, in order to sign their contracts upon it. Would the fortune, which  he raised by this expedient, make him a handsome fellow; though it be  confessed, that personal beauty arises very much from ideas of utility?  The imagination is influenced by associations of ideas; which, though  they arise at first from the judgement, are not easily altered by every  particular exception that occurs to us. To which we may add, in  the present case of chastity, that the example of the old would be  pernicious to the young; and that women, continually foreseeing that a  certain time would bring them the liberty of indulgence, would naturally  advance that period, and think more lightly of this whole duty, so  requisite to society.    Those who live in the same family have such frequent opportunities of  licence of this kind, that nothing could prevent purity of manners, were  marriage allowed, among the nearest relations, or any intercourse of  love between them ratified by law and custom. Incest, therefore, being  PERNICIOUS in a superior degree, has also a superior turpitude and moral  deformity annexed to it.    What is the reason, why, by the Athenian laws, one might marry a  half-sister by the father, but not by the mother? Plainly this:  The manners of the Athenians were so reserved, that a man was never  permitted to approach the women's apartment, even in the same family,  unless where he visited his own mother. His step-mother and her children  were as much shut up from him as the woman of any other family, and  there was as little danger of any criminal correspondence between them.  Uncles and nieces, for a like reason, might marry at Athens; but neither  these, nor half-brothers and sisters, could contract that alliance at  Rome, where the intercourse was more open between the sexes. Public  utility is the cause of all these variations.    To repeat, to a man's prejudice, anything that escaped him in private  conversation, or to make any such use of his private letters, is highly  blamed. The free and social intercourse of minds must be extremely  checked, where no such rules of fidelity are established.    Even in repeating stories, whence we can foresee no ill consequences  to result, the giving of one's author is regarded as a piece of  indiscretion, if not of immorality. These stories, in passing from hand  to hand, and receiving all the usual variations, frequently come about  to the persons concerned, and produce animosities and quarrels among  people, whose intentions are the most innocent and inoffensive.    To pry into secrets, to open or even read the letters of others, to  play the spy upon their words and looks and actions; what habits more  inconvenient in society? What habits, of consequence, more blameable?    This principle is also the foundation of most of the laws of good  manners; a kind of lesser morality, calculated for the ease of company  and conversation. Too much or too little ceremony are both blamed, and  everything, which promotes ease, without an indecent familiarity, is  useful and laudable.    Constancy in friendships, attachments, and familiarities, is  commendable, and is requisite to support trust and good correspondence  in society. But in places of general, though casual concourse, where  the pursuit of health and pleasure brings people promiscuously together,  public conveniency has dispensed with this maxim; and custom there  promotes an unreserved conversation for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43282"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.No. 6.

HUGHES.           *       *       *       *       *                               =New Industrial Enterprises.=    The increasing wealth of a nation, as well as the profitable and steady  employment of its capital and people, depends upon a continual increase  of the producing power. Whenever there are latent resources undeveloped  or opportunities for establishing the first foundation of an industry,  leading as it will to the originating of hundreds of auxiliary ones, an  unusual effort should be made to bring it into existence. If in the  power of individuals to accomplish, so much the better; if needing an  association with State or national influence, then this association  should be formed. It is incumbent upon individuals that they possess a  sufficient pride in the prosperity of the country to give every possible  attention and assistance to a careful practical demonstration of the  feasibility of all the new industrial enterprises which may be presented  with reasonable assurance of final success.    Not in a great expenditure of money: influence is better than money, and  a potential interest in a new enterprise is often better than capital.  The industrial resources of the United States are by no means worked to  their full capacity. The people by no means make all they consume. The  finer articles of use, and requiring much labor and often the highest  skill, are imported from foreign nations. A premium of $10,000 offered  for an improved method in any known present process of production or  manufacture would be almost sure to be called for.    While America exports $175,000,000 worth of raw cotton annually to be  worked up by other people, is it not possible to so increase the  manufacture in America as to keep the greater part of that raw material  and to export the cloth instead? Is it not practicable to establish  great numbers more of sugar estates in the same tropical climate? Is it  not practicable to lay the foundation of half a dozen beet sugar mills  in the country? To begin the weaving of linen goods, and to teach our  farmers that they may produce all the flax fiber as fast as required? To  start a ramie industry in a small way and teach the process to those who  will engage in it?    Will not our silk men put a velvet industry into operation as a germ  from which a future industry may grow? And we might name a hundred other  lesser enterprises which have hardly name in this country, but every one  of which is needed and will add to the wealth of the people.           *       *       *       *       *                           =Replanting and Transplanting Teeth.=    Dr. G. R. Thomas, of Detroit, in the current number of the _Dental  Cosmos_, states that this operation of \"replanting\" has become so common  with him, and the results so uniformly satisfactory, that he does not  hesitate to perform it on any tooth in the mouth, if the case demands  it; and he finds the cases that demand it, and the number that he  operates upon, continually multiplying.    He makes it a point to examine the end of the roots of nearly all his  cases of abscessed teeth; and a record of more than 150 cases, with but  one loss (and that in the mouth of a man so timid that he utterly  refused to bear the pain which nearly always follows for a few minutes,  therefore necessitating re-extraction), convinces him that the operation  is not only practical, but decidedly beneficial to both patient and  operator. For one sitting is all that he has ever really found necessary  to the full and complete restoration of the case.    In the present article, however, Dr. Thomas states that it is his object  not so much to speak of replanting as of transplanting, which he has  reason to believe is just as practical, so far as the mere re-attachment  is concerned, as is replanting. He details, in illustration, a case in  which he successfully performed the operation; inserting in the mouth of  a gentleman, who had lost a right superior cuspidate, a solid and  healthy tooth that he had removed from a lady's mouth four weeks  previously. He opened into canal and pulp chamber of the tooth, from the  apex of the root only; cut the end off one eighth of an inch (it being  that much too long), reduced the size somewhat in the center of the root  (it being a trifle larger than the root extracted), filled and placed it  in position. He states that the occlusion, shape, and color were  perfect, so much so that several dentists who saw the case were not able  to distinguish the transplanted tooth from the others. The two features  in the case that he calls particular attention to are: first, that  although the tooth had been in his office four weeks, there is to-day no  perceptible change in color; and second, that the re-attachment is as  perfect as though it had been transplanted or replanted the same day of  extraction. The operation was performed about three months ago. Dr.  Thomas knows of but two obstacles in the way of the perfect  practicability of \"transplanting:\" first, the difficulty of obtaining  the proper teeth at the proper time; and second, the possibility of  inoculation. The latter is the more formidable of the two, and, to  escape the ills that might follow, the greatest caution is necessary.  The first difficulty is more easily gotten over, for it is not necessary  that the tooth transplanted should correspond exactly in shape and size  to the one extracted; if it is too large, it may be carefully reduced;  or if too small, new osseous deposit will supply the deficiency. Neither  is it necessary, as we have seen, that the transplanted tooth should be  a freshly extracted one.    As a demonstration of what modern dental surgery is capable of  performing Dr. Thomas' statements are very interesting; it is doubtful,  however, whether popular prejudice will allow this practice of  \"transplanting\" to become of much use.           *       *       *       *       *                              =American Institute Exhibition.=    For forty-seven years the American Institute of New York has opened its  doors and invited American inventors and manufacturers to exhibit their  productions; and again this year it renews its invitation to all. To  such as wish to reach the capitalist and consumer, they must admit that  New York is the place.

The Newcastle coal is principally  used in the manufacture of London gas. Scotch parrot coal produces a  superior gas, but the coke produced is of inferior quality. Boghead coal  is also used for gas making--in fact, every kind of coal, except  anthracite, may be used for this purpose. The bituminous shale produces  a very good gas, and it is used partly to supply the place of cannel or  parrot coal. As carbon and hydrogen, principally with oxygen, are the  elements from which gas is formed, most substances containing these  elements can be partially converted into gas. And gas has been made from  grease or kitchen waste, oil peat, rosin, and wood, besides coal. A ton  of Newcastle or caking coal yields about 9,000 cubic feet of gas, Scotch  coal about 11,000, English cannel about 10,000, and shale about 7,000,  with illuminating powers in the ratio of about 13, 25, 22, and 36  respectively. The coal is put in retorts, _r_, commonly made of fire  clay and often of cast iron. These retorts are from 6 feet to 9 feet  long, and from 1 foot to 1 foot 8 inches in breadth. They are made like  the letter D, elliptical, cylindrical, or bean shaped. They are built  into an arched oven, and heated by furnaces, _f_, beneath. One, three,  five, seven, or more are built in the same oven. The mouthpieces are of  cast iron, and project outward from the oven, so as to allow ascension  pipes, _a p_, to be fixed, to convey the gas generated from the coal to  the hydraulic main, _h m_. After the coal has been introduced into the  retorts, their mouths are closed with lids luted round the edges with  clay, and kept tight by a screw. The retorts are kept at a bright red  heat. If the temperature be too low, less gas and more tar are produced,  less residue being left; while, should the temperature be too high, the  product is more volatile, more residue remaining. And should the gas  remain"]]]
