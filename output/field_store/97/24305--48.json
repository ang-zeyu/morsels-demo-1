An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#8)"],[1," and believed that he  had proved, that the institution of a day of rest at weekly intervals  is inseparably bound up with a political system based on the equality of  conditions; that without equality this institution is an anomaly and  an impossibility: that equality alone can revive this ancient and  mysterious keeping of the seventh day. This argument did not meet with  your approbation, since, without denying the relation pointed out by  the competitor, you judged, and rightly gentlemen, that the principle of  equality of conditions not being demonstrated, the ideas of the author  were nothing more than hypotheses.    \"Finally, gentlemen, this fundamental principle of equality you  presented for competition in the following terms: THE ECONOMICAL AND  MORAL CONSEQUENCES IN FRANCE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME, AND THOSE WHICH  SEEM LIKELY TO APPEAR IN FUTURE, OF THE LAW CONCERNING THE EQUAL  DIVISION OF HEREDITARY PROPERTY BETWEEN THE CHILDREN.    \"Instead of confining one to common places without breadth or  significance, it seems to me that your question should be developed as  follows:--    \"If the law has been able to render the right of heredity common to  all the children of one father, can it not render it equal for all his  grandchildren and great-grandchildren?    \"If the law no longer heeds the age of any member of the family, can  it not, by the right of heredity, cease to heed it in the race, in the  tribe, in the nation?    \"Can equality, by the right of succession, be preserved between  citizens, as well as between cousins and brothers? In a word, can the  principle of succession become a principle of equality?    \"To sum up all these ideas in one inclusive question: What is the  principle of heredity? What are the foundations of inequality? What is  property?    \"Such, gentlemen, is the object of the memoir that I offer you to day.    \"If I have rightly grasped the object of your thought; if I succeed in  bringing to light a truth which is indisputable, but, from causes  which I am bold enough to claim to have explained, has always been  misunderstood; if by an infallible method of investigation, I establish  the dogma of equality of conditions; if I determine the principle  of civil law, the essence of justice, and the form of society; if I  annihilate property forever,--to you, gentlemen, will redound all the  glory, for it is to your aid and your inspiration that I owe it.    \"My purpose in this work is the application of method to the problems of  philosophy; every other intention is foreign to and even abusive of it.    \"I have spoken lightly of jurisprudence: I had the right; but I should  be unjust did I not distinguish between this pretended science and  the men who practise it. Devoted to studies both laborious and severe,  entitled in all respects to the esteem of their fellow-citizens by their  knowledge and eloquence our legists deserve but one reproach, that of an  excessive deference to arbitrary laws.    \"I have been pitiless in my criticism of the economists: for them  I confess that, in general, I have no liking. The arrogance and  the emptiness of their writings, their impertinent pride and their  unwarranted blunders, have disgusted me. Whoever, knowing them, pardons  them, may read them.    \"I have severely blamed the learned Christian Church: it was my duty.  This blame results from the facts which I call attention to: why has  the Church decreed concerning things which it does not understand? The  Church has erred in dogma and in morals; physics and mathematics  testify against her. It may be wrong for me to say it, but surely it  is unfortunate for Christianity that it is true. To restore religion,  gentlemen, it is necessary to condemn the Church.    \"Perhaps you will regret, gentlemen, that, in giving all my attention to  method and evidence, I have too much neglected form and style: in vain  should I have tried to do better. Literary hope and faith I have none.  The nineteenth century is, in my eyes, a genesic era, in which new  principles are elaborated, but in which nothing that is written shall  endure. That is the reason, in my opinion, why, among so many men of  talent, France to-day counts not one great writer. In a society like  ours, to seek for literary glory seems to me an anachronism. Of what  use is it to invoke an ancient sibyl when a muse is on the eve of birth?  Pitiable actors in a tragedy nearing its end, that which it behooves us  to do is to precipitate the catastrophe. The most deserving among us  is he who plays best this part. Well, I no longer aspire to this sad  success!    \"Why should I not confess it, gentlemen? I have aspired to your  suffrages and sought the title of your pensioner, hating all which  exists and full of projects for its destruction; I shall finish this  investigation in a spirit of calm and philosophical resignation. I have  derived more peace from the knowledge of the truth, than anger from the  feeling of oppression; and the most precious fruit that I could wish to  gather from this memoir would be the inspiration of my readers with that  tranquillity of soul which arises from the clear perception of evil and  its cause, and which is much more powerful than passion and enthusiasm.  My hatred of privilege and human authority was unbounded; perhaps at  times I have been guilty, in my indignation, of confounding persons and  things; at present I can only despise and complain; to cease to hate I  only needed to know.    \"It is for you now, gentlemen, whose mission and character are the  proclamation of the truth, it is for you to instruct the people, and to  tell them for what they ought to hope and what they ought to fear. The  people, incapable as yet of sound judgment as to what is best for them,  applaud indiscriminately the most opposite ideas, provided that in them  they get a taste of flattery: to them the laws of thought are like the  confines of the possible; to-day they can no more distinguish between a  savant and a sophist, than formerly they could tell a physician from  a sorcerer. 'Inconsiderately accepting, gathering together, and  accumulating everything that is new, regarding all reports as true and  indubitable, at the breath or ring of novelty they assemble like bees at  the sound of a basin.' [4]    \"May you, gentlemen, desire equality as I myself desire it; may you,  for the eternal happiness of our country, become its propagators and its  heralds; may I be the last of your pensioners! Of all the wishes that  I can frame, that, gentlemen, is the most worthy of you and the most  honorable for me.    \"I am, with the profoundest respect and the most earnest gratitude,    \"Your pensioner,    \"P. J. PROUDHON.\"      Two months after the receipt of this letter, the Academy, in its debate  of August 24th, replied to the address of its pensioner by a note, the  text of which I give below:--      \"A member calls the attention of the Academy to a pamphlet, published  last June by the titulary of the Suard pension, entitled, \"What is  property?\" and dedicated by the author to the Academy. He is of the  opinion that the society owes it to justice, to example, and to its  own dignity, to publicly disavow all responsibility for the anti-social  doctrines contained in this publication. In consequence he demands:    \"1. That the Academy disavow and condemn, in the most formal manner,  the work of the Suard pensioner, as having been published without its  assent, and as attributing to it opinions diametrically opposed to the  principles of each of its members;    \"2. That the pensioner be charged, in case he should publish a second  edition of his book, to omit the dedication;    \"3. That this judgment of the Academy be placed upon the records.    \"These three propositions, put to vote, are adopted.\"      After this ludicrous decree, which its authors thought to render  powerful by giving it the form of a contradiction, I can only beg the  reader not to measure the intelligence of my compatriots by that of our  Academy.    While my patrons in the social and political sciences were fulminating  anathemas against my brochure, a man, who was a stranger to  Franche-Comte, who did not know me, who might even have regarded himself  as personally attacked by the too sharp judgment which I had passed upon  the economists, a publicist as learned as he was modest, loved by the  people whose sorrows he felt, honored by the power which he sought to  enlighten without flattering or disgracing it, M. Blanqui--member of the  Institute, professor of political economy, defender of property--took up  my defence before his associates and before the ministry, and saved me  from the blows of a justice which is always blind, because it is always  ignorant.    It seems to me that the reader will peruse with pleasure the letter  which M. Blanqui did me the honor to write to me upon the publication  of my second memoir, a letter as honorable to its author as it is  flattering to him to whom it is addressed.        \"PARIS, May 1, 1841.    \"MONSIEUR,--I hasten to thank you for forwarding to me your second  memoir upon property. I have read it with all the interest that an  acquaintance with the first would naturally inspire. I am very glad that  you have modified somewhat the rudeness of form which gave to a work  of such gravity the manner and appearance of a pamphlet; for you quite  frightened me, sir, and your talent was needed to reassure me in regard  to your intentions. One does not expend so much real knowledge with  the purpose of inflaming his country. This proposition, now coming into  notice--PROPERTY IS ROBBERY!--was of a nature to repel from your book  even those serious minds who do not judge by appearances, had you  persisted in maintaining it in its rude simplicity.

She lives alone in a dilapidated  cabin which rests in a clump of trees by the side of the railroad. The  sagging roof is patched with pieces of rusty tin of many shapes and  sizes.    \"Nannie,\" I said, \"aren't you afraid to live here alone?\"    \"How come I be skeered?

She was a slave to Dr. Lucas of Mt. Meigs neighborhood long  before the War between the States. Dr. Lucas is one of the well known  Lucas family, with whom General LaFayette spent some time while touring  the United States in 1824.    \"Our Marster wuz sho good to all his 'niggers',\" she said. \"Us allus had  plenty to eat and plenty to wear, but de days now is hard, if white  folks gin you a nickel or dime to git you sumpin' t' eat you has to  write everything down in a book before you can git it. I allus worked in  the field, had to carry big logs, had strops on my arms and them logs  was put in de strop and hauled to a pile where they all was. One morning  hit was rainin' ad I didn' wanna go to the field, but de oversee' he  come and got me and started whooping me. I jumped on him and bit and  kicked him 'til he lemme go. I didn't know no better then. I didn't know  he was de one to do dat.    \"But Marster Lucas gin us big times on Christmas and July. Us 'ud have  big dinners and all the lemonade us could drink.

Well, she'd sho cook good cake and had plenty of  'em but she wouldn't lak to cut dem cakes often. She keep 'em in a safe.  One day I go to dat safe and I seed some and I wanted it so bad till I  jes' had to have some. Nancy say to me, 'Martha, did you cut dat cake?'  I say, 'No sir! dat knife just flew 'roun by itself and cut dat cake.'    \"One day I was workin' in de field and de overseer he come 'roun and say  sumpin' to me he had no bizness say.

Asked to tell  something of his early life, he said:    [Illustration: _Allen Brown, Eufala, Alabama_]    \"I is nigh on to a hundred yeahs old, Suh, and I was brung to dis  country from Virginny whar I was bawn.

Johnson, Birmingham, Alabama_    _GUS SAW MASSA'S HAT SHOT OFF_    \"They is all gone, scattered, and old massa and missus have died.\" That  was the sequence of the tragic tale of \"Uncle\" Gus Brown, the body  servant of William Brown; who fought beside him in the War between the  States and who knew Stonewall Jackson.    \"Uncle Gus\" recalled happenings on the old plantation where he was  reared. His master was a \"king\" man, he said, on whose plantation in  Richmond, Virginia, Uncle Gus waited on the tables at large feasts and  functions of the spacious days before the War. He was entrusted to go  with the master's boys down to the old swimming hole and go in \"washin.\"  They would take off their clothes, hide them in the bushes on the side  of the bank, put a big plank by the side of the old water hole and go in  diving, swimming and have all the fun that youngsters would want, he  said.    Apparently his master's home was a plantation house with large columns  and with all the glitter and glamour that the homes around Richmond have  to offer. About it were large grain storage places for the master was a  grain dealer and men on the plantation produced and ground large  quantities into flour.    Gus worked around the house, and he remembers well the corn shuckings as  he called them on which occasions the Negroes gave vent to emotion in  the form of dancing and music. \"On those occasions we all got together  and had a regular good time,\" he said.    \"Uncle,\" he was asked, \"do you remember"]]]
