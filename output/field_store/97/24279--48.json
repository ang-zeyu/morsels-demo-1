In meekness and might, he was found  31:1    preaching the gospel to the poor. Pride and fear are unfit          to bear the standard of Truth, and God will never place  31:3    it in such hands.                              Fleshly ties temporal            Jesus acknowledged no ties of the flesh. He said: \"Call          no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father,  31:6    which is in heaven.\" Again he asked: \"Who          is my mother, and who are my brethren,\" im-          plying that it is they who do the will of his Father. We  31:9    have no record of his calling any man by the name of          /father/. He recognized Spirit, God, as the only creator, and          therefore as the Father of all.                                 Healing primary    31:12   First in the list of Christian duties, he taught his fol-          lowers the healing power of Truth and Love. He attached          no importance to dead ceremonies. It is the  31:15   living Christ, the practical Truth, which makes          Jesus \"the resurrection and the life\" to all who follow him          in deed. Obeying his precious precepts, - following his  31:18   demonstration so far as we apprehend it, - we drink of          his cup, partake of his bread, are baptized with his pu-          rity; and at last we shall rest, sit down with him, in a full  31:21   understanding of the divine Principle which triumphs          over death. For what says Paul? \"As often as ye eat          this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's  31:24   death till he come.\"                                Painful prospect            Referring to the materiality of the age, Jesus said:          \"The hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor-  31:27   shippers shall worship the Father in spirit          and in truth.\" Again, foreseeing the perse-          cution which would attend the Science of Spirit, Jesus  31:30   said: \"They shall put you out of the synagogues; yea,          the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think          that he doeth God service; and these things will they  32:1    do unto you, because they have not known the Father          nor me.\"                                Sacred sacrament    32:3    In ancient Rome a soldier was required to swear          allegiance to his general. The Latin word for this oath          was /sacramentum/, and our English word  32:6    /sacrament/ is derived from it. Among the          Jews it was an ancient custom for the master of a          feast to pass each guest a cup of wine. But the  32:9    Eucharist does not commemorate a Roman soldier's          oath, nor was the wine, used on convivial occasions and          in Jewish rites, the cup of our Lord. The cup shows  32:12   forth his bitter experience, - the cup which he prayed          might pass from him, though he bowed in holy submis-          sion to the divine decree.    32:15   \"As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed          it and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said,          Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and  32:18   gave thanks, and gave it to them saying, Drink ye all          of it.\"                              Spiritual refreshment            The true sense is spiritually lost, if the sacrament is  32:21   confined to the use of bread and wine. The disciples          had eaten, yet Jesus prayed and gave them          bread. This would have been foolish in a  32:24   literal sense; but in its spiritual signification, it was nat-          ural and beautiful. Jesus prayed; he withdrew from the          material senses to refresh his heart with brighter, with  32:27   spiritual views.                                Jesus' sad repast            The Passover, which Jesus ate with his disciples in          the month Nisan on the night before his crucifixion,  32:30   was a mournful occasion, a sad supper taken          at the close of day, in the twilight of a          glorious career with shadows fast falling around; and  33:1    this supper closed forever Jesus' ritualism or concessions          to matter.                                Heavenly supplies    33:3    His followers, sorrowful and silent, anticipating the hour          of their Master's betrayal, partook of the heavenly manna,          which of old had fed in the wilderness the  33:6    persecuted followers of Truth. Their bread          indeed came down from heaven. It was the great truth          of spiritual being, healing the sick and casting out error.  33:9    Their Master had explained it all before, and now this          bread was feeding and sustaining them. They had borne          this bread from house to house, /breaking/ (explaining) it to  33:12   others, and now it comforted themselves.            For this truth of spiritual being, their Master was about          to suffer violence and drain to the dregs his cup of sorrow.  33:15   He must leave them. With the great glory of an everlast-          ing victory overshadowing him, he gave thanks and said,          \"Drink ye all of it.\"                                The holy struggle    33:18   When the human element in him struggled with the          divine, our great Teacher said: \"Not my will, but          Thine, be done!\"- that is, Let not the flesh,  33:21   but the Spirit, be represented in me. This          is the new understanding of spiritual Love. It gives all          for Christ, or Truth. It blesses its enemies, heals the  33:24   sick, casts out error, raises the dead from trespasses          and sins, and preaches the gospel to the poor, the meek          in heart.                               Incisive questions    33:27   Christians, are you drinking his cup? Have you          shared the blood of the New Covenant, the persecutions          which attend a new and higher understand-  33:30   ing of God? If not, can you then say that          you have commemorated Jesus in his cup? Are all          who eat bread and drink wine in memory of Jesus willing  34:1    truly to drink his cup, take his cross, and leave all for          the Christ-principle? Then why ascribe this inspira-  34:3    tion to a dead rite, instead of showing, by casting out          error and making the body \"holy, acceptable unto God,\"          that Truth has come to the understanding? If Christ,  34:6    Truth, has come to us in demonstration, no other com-          memoration is requisite, for demonstration is Immanuel,          or /God with us/; and if a friend be with us, why need we  34:9    memorials of that friend?                                Millennial glory            If all who ever partook of the sacrament had really          commemorated the sufferings of Jesus and drunk of  34:12   his cup, they would have revolutionized the          world. If all who seek his commemoration          through material symbols will take up the cross, heal  34:15   the sick, cast out evils, and preach Christ, or Truth,          to the poor, - the receptive thought, - they will bring          in the millennium.                             Fellowship with Christ    34:18   Through all the disciples experienced, they became more          spiritual and understood better what the Master had          taught. His resurrection was also their resur-  34:21   rection. It helped them to raise themselves and          others from spiritual dulness and blind belief in God into          the perception of infinite possibilities. They needed this  34:24   quickening, for soon their dear Master would rise again          in the spiritual realm of reality, and ascend far above          their apprehension. As the reward for his faithfulness,  34:27   he would disappear to material sense in that change which          has since been called the ascension.                               The last breakfast            What a contrast between our Lord's last supper and  34:30   his last spiritual breakfast with his disciples          in the bright morning hours at the joyful          meeting on the shore of the Galilean Sea! His gloom  35:1    had passed into glory, and His disciples' grief into repent-          ance, - hearts chastened and pride rebuked. Convinced  35:3    of the fruitlessness of their toil in the dark and wakened          by their Master's voice, they changed their methods, turned          away from material things, and cast their net on the right  35:6    side. Discerning Christ, Truth, anew on the shore of          time, they were enabled to rise somewhat from mortal          sensuousness, or the burial of mind in matter, into new-  35:9    ness of life as Spirit.            This spiritual meeting with our Lord in the dawn of a          new light is the morning meal which Christian Scientists  35:12   commemorate. They bow before Christ, Truth, to re-          ceive more of his reappearing and silently to commune          with the divine Principle, Love. They celebrate their  35:15   Lord's victory over death, his probation in the flesh          after death, its exemplification of human probation, and          his spiritual and final ascension above matter, or the flesh,  35:18   when he rose out of material sight.                               Spiritual Eucharist            Our baptism is a purification from all error. Our          church is built on the divine Principle, Love. We can  35:21   unite with this church only as we are new-          born of Spirit, as we reach the Life which          is Truth and the Truth which is Life by bringing forth  35:24   the fruits of Love, - casting out error and healing the          sick. Our Eucharist is spiritual communion with the one          God. Our bread, \"which cometh down from heaven,\"  35:27   is Truth. Our cup is the cross. Our wine the inspira-          tion of Love, the draught our Master drank and com-          mended to his followers.

We must, therefore, give credit to Vasari's account of  Borghese; for if we discredit him on this occasion, as some have done,  when are we to believe him? It is true, indeed, that he is guilty of a  strange anachronism in mentioning Guidubaldo, the old Duke of Urbino, as  his first patron; but this kind of error is frequent in him, and not to  be regarded.]    [Footnote 15: \"Fu eccellentissimo prospettivo, e il maggior geometra de'  suoi tempi.\" Romano Alberti, Trattato della nobilta della pittura, p.  32. See also Pascoli, Vite, tom. i. p. 90.]    [Footnote 16: It appears that in this art he was preceded by Van Eych of  Flanders. See tom. i. p. 81, &c.; and also the eulogium on him by  Bartolommeo Facio, p. 46, where he praises his skill in geometry, and  refers to several of his pictures, which prove him to have been highly  accomplished, and almost unrivalled in perspective.]    [Footnote 17: If there be any truth in Pietro having been blind for  twenty-four years, I do not know how he could have painted Sixtus IV. On  the other hand this tradition of his blindness comes from Vasari, whose  family was so intimately connected with that of Pietro della Francesca,  that there was less room for error in the life of that artist than in  any other. This excellent picture, of which I have seen a beautiful copy  in the possession of the Duke di Ceri, I should myself rather attribute  to Melozzo.]    [Footnote 18: He is favorably mentioned by Crispolti, in the _Perugia  Augusta_; by Ciatti, in the _Istorie di Perugia_; Alessi, in the _Elogi  de' Perugini illustri_; and by Pascoli, in the _Vite de' Pittori Sc.  Arch. Perugini_; with whom I can in no manner concur in opinion, that  \"Benedetto was equal to the best artists of his time, and probably the  first among the early masters who contributed to the introduction of an  improved style,\" (p. 21). An assertion singularly unjust to Masaccio.]    [Footnote 19: He subscribed himself _de Castro Plebis_, now _Citta della  Pieve_. There, according to Pascoli, the father was born, who afterwards  removed to Perugia, where Pietro was born; but the greater probability  is, that Pietro also was born in Citta della Pieve. _Mariotti._]    [Footnote 20: This resemblance might have arisen from his imitation of  the works of Borghese, (Pietro della Francesca) which he saw in Perugia,  as it most assuredly cannot be proved that Perugino was ever in his  school. P. Valle and others express great doubts of it, and when I  reflect that Vannucci was only twelve years old when Borghese lost his  sight, I regard it as an absurd tradition.]    [Footnote 21: Vasari, at the close of his Life observes, \"none of his  scholars ever equalled Pietro in application or in amenity of colour.\"  Padre della Valle asserts on the contrary, \"that he was indebted for a  great portion of his celebrity to the talents displayed by his  scholars;\" and says that he detected the touch of Raffaello in his  picture in the Grand Duke's collection; but we must have a stronger  testimony before we submit ourselves to this decision.]    [Footnote 22: Descrizione del Palazzo Vaticano, p. 36.]    [Footnote 23: Consisting of three subjects from the Life of Christ, in  the Chapel of the Holy Sacraments. The Annunciation, the Birth of  Christ, and the Dispute with the Doctors, the best of the three. In one  of these he introduced his own portrait. Vasari does not mention this  fine production.]    [Footnote 24: He probably came to Venice from Rimino, or resided there  for some time. We find other early painters assigned first to one  country and then to another, as Jacopo Davanzo, Pietro Vannucci, Lorenzo  Lotto, &c.]    [Footnote 25: It is said that Mengs, who was desirous of being  considered a philosophical painter, coincided with Vitruvius in opinion.  But this opinion should be restricted to some indifferent specimens; for  when he afterwards saw them painted in the true style of the ancients,  he regarded them with extraordinary pleasure; as in Genoa, which  possesses some beautiful arabesques by Vaga. So the defender of Ratti  assures us.]            ROMAN SCHOOL.      EPOCH II.      _Raffaello and his School._      We are now arrived at the most brilliant period, not only of the Roman  School, but of modern painting itself. We have seen the art carried to a  high degree of perfection by Da Vinci and Bonarruoti, at the beginning  of the sixteenth century, and it is a remarkable fact that the same  period embraces not only Raphael, but also Coreggio, Giorgione, and  Titian, and the most celebrated Venetian painters: so that a man  enjoying the common term of life might have seen the works of all these  illustrious masters. The art in but a few years thus reached a height to  which it had never before attained, and which has never been rivalled,  except in the attempt to imitate these early masters, or to unite in one  style their varied and divided excellences. It seems indeed an ordinary  law of providence, that individuals of consummate genius should be born  and flourish at the same period, or at least at short intervals from  each other, a circumstance of which Velleius Paterculus, after a  diligent investigation, protested he could never discover the real  cause. I observe, he says, men of the same commanding genius making  their appearance together, in the smallest possible space of time; as it  happens in the case of animals of different kinds, which, confined in a  close place, nevertheless each selects its own class, and those of a  kindred race separate themselves from the rest, and unite in the closest  manner. A single age was sufficient to illustrate Tragedy, in the  persons of AEschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides: ancient comedy under  Cratinus, Aristophanes, and Eumolpides; and in like manner the new  comedy under Menander, Diphilus, and Philemon. There appeared few  philosophers of note after the days of Plato and Aristotle, and whoever  has made himself acquainted with Isocrates and his school, is acquainted  with the summit of Grecian eloquence. The same remark applies also to  other countries. The great Roman writers are included under the single  age of Octavius: Leo X. was the Augustus of modern Italy; the reign of  Louis XIV. was the brilliant era of French letters, that of Charles II.  of the English.    This rule applies equally to the fine arts. _Hoc idem_, proceeds  Velleius, _evenisse plastis, pictoribus, sculptoribus, quisquis temporum  institerit notis reperiet, et eminentiam cujusque operis arctissimis  temporum claustris circumdatam._[26] Of this union of men of genius in  the same age, _Causas_, he says, _quum semper requiro, numquam invenio  quas veras confidam_. It seems to him probable that when a man finds  the first station in art occupied by another, he considers it as a post  that has been rightfully seized on, and no longer aspires to the  possession of it, but is humiliated, and contented to follow at a  distance. But this solution I confess does not satisfy my mind. It may  indeed account to us why no other Michelangiolo, or Raffaello, has ever  appeared; but it does not satisfy me why these two, and the others  before mentioned, should all have appeared together in the same age. For  myself, I am of opinion that the age is always influenced by certain  principles, universally adopted both by professors of the art, and by  amateurs: which principles happening at a particular period to be the  most just and accurate of their kind, produce in that age some  supereminent professors, and a number of good ones. These principles  change through the instability of all human affairs, and the age  partakes in the change. I may add, nevertheless, that these happy  periods never occur without the circumstance of a number of princes and  influential individuals rivalling each other in the encouragement of  works of taste; and amidst these there always arise some persons of  commanding genius, who give a bias and tone to art. The history of  sculpture in Athens, a city where munificence and taste went hand in  hand, favours my opinion, and it is further confirmed by this golden  period of Italian art. Nevertheless I do not pretend to give a verdict  on this important question, but leave the decision of it to a more  competent tribunal.    But although it be a matter of difficulty to account for this  developement and union of rare talent at one particular period, we may  however hope to trace the steps of a single individual to excellence;  and I would wish to do so of Raffaello. Nature and fortune seemed to  unite in lavishing their favours on this artist; the first in investing  him with the rarest gifts of genius, the other in adding to these a  singular combination of propitious circumstances. In order to illustrate  our inquiry it will be necessary to observe him from his earliest  years,[27] and to note the progress of his mind. He was born in Urbino  in 1483; and if climate, as seems not improbable, have any influence on  the genius of an artist, I know not a happier spot that could have been  chosen for his birth, than that part of Italy which gave to architecture  a Bramante, supplied the art of painting with a successor to Raffaello  in Baroccio, and bestowed on sculpture the plastic hand of a Brandani,  without referring to many less celebrated, but still deserving artists,  who are the boast of Urbino and her state. The father of this  illustrious artist was Giovanni di Santi,[28] or as he has been commonly  called Giovanni Sanzio, an artist of moderate talents, and who could  contribute but little to the instruction of his son; although it was no  small advantage to have been initiated in a simple style, divested of  mannerism. He made some further progress from studying the works of F.  Carnevale, an artist"]]]
