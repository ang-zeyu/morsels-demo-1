[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#8)"],[1," stood at a window looking out upon  the sunlit drillground and the broad sweep of green beyond. He was  toying with his slim hands caressingly. Half a smile was on his lips.  No man had ever seen more than that half smile illuminate Shan Tung's  face. His black hair was sleek and carefully trimmed. His dress was  immaculate. His slimness, as McDowell had noted, was the slimness of a  young girl.    When Cruze came to announce that McDowell would see him, Shan Tung was  still visioning the golden-headed figure of Miriam Kirkstone as he had  seen her passing through the sunshine. There was something like a purr  in his breath as he stood interlacing his tapering fingers. The instant  he heard the secretary's footsteps the finger play stopped, the purr  died, the half smile was gone. He turned softly. Cruze did not speak.  He simply made a movement of his head, and Shan Tung's feet fell  noiselessly. Only the slight sound made by the opening and closing of a  door gave evidence of his entrance into the Inspector's room. Shan Tung  and no other could open and close a door like that. Cruze shivered. He  always shivered when Shan Tung passed him, and always he swore that he  could smell something in the air, like a poison left behind.    Keith, facing the window, was waiting. The moment the door was opened,  he felt Shan Tung's presence. Every nerve in his body was keyed to an  uncomfortable tension. The thought that his grip on himself was  weakening, and because of a Chinaman, maddened him. And he must turn.  Not to face Shan Tung now would be but a postponement of the ordeal and  a confession of cowardice. Forcing his hand into Conniston's little  trick of twisting a mustache, he turned slowly, leveling his eyes  squarely to meet Shan Tung's.    To his surprise Shan Tung seemed utterly oblivious of his presence. He  had not, apparently, taken more than a casual glance in his direction.  In a voice which one beyond the door might have mistaken for a woman's,  he was saying to McDowell:    \"I have seen the man you sent me to see, Mr. McDowell. It is Larsen. He  has changed much in eight years. He has grown a beard. He has lost an  eye. His hair has whitened. But it is Larsen.\" The faultlessness of his  speech and the unemotional but perfect inflection of his words made  Keith, like the young secretary, shiver where he stood. In McDowell's  face he saw a flash of exultation.    \"He had no suspicion of you, Shan Tung?\"    \"He did not see me to suspect. He will be there--when--\" Slowly he  faced Keith. \"--When Mr. Conniston goes to arrest him,\" he finished.    He inclined his head as he backed noiselessly toward the door. His  yellow eyes did not leave Keith's face. In them Keith fancied that he  caught a sinister gleam. There was the faintest inflection of a new  note in his voice, and his fingers were playing again, but not as when  he had looked out through the window at Miriam Kirkstone. And then--in  a flash, it seemed to Keith--the Chinaman's eyes closed to narrow  slits, and the pupils became points of flame no larger than the  sharpened ends of a pair of pencils. The last that Keith was conscious  of seeing of Shan Tung was the oriental's eyes. They had seemed to drag  his soul half out of his body.    \"A queer devil,\" said McDowell. \"After he is gone, I always feel as if  a snake had been in the room. He still hates you, Conniston. Three  years have made no difference. He hates you like poison. I believe he  would kill you, if he had a chance to do it and get away with the  Business. And you--you blooming idiot--simply twiddle your mustache and  laugh at him! I'd feel differently if I were in your boots.\"    Inwardly Keith was asking himself why it was that Shan Tung had hated  Conniston.    McDowell added nothing to enlighten him. He was gathering up a number  of papers scattered on his desk, smiling with a grim satisfaction.  \"It's Larsen all right if Shan Tung says so,\" he told Keith. And then,  as if he had only thought of the matter, he said, \"You're going to  reenlist, aren't you, Conniston?\"    \"I still owe the Service a month or so before my term expires, don't I?  After that--yes--I believe I shall reenlist.\"    \"Good!\" approved the Inspector. \"I'll have you a sergeancy within a  month. Meanwhile you're off duty and may do anything you please. You  know Brady, the Company agent? He's up the Mackenzie on a trip, and  here's the key to his shack. I know you'll appreciate getting under a  real roof again, and Brady won't object as long as I collect his thirty  dollars a month rent. Of course Barracks is open to you, but it just  occurred to me you might prefer this place while on furlough.  Everything is there from a bathtub to nutcrackers, and I know a little  Jap in town who is hunting a job as a cook. What do you say?\"    \"Splendid!\" cried Keith. \"I'll go up at once, and if you'll hustle the  Jap along, I'll appreciate it. You might tell him to bring up stuff for  dinner,\" he added.    McDowell gave him a key. Ten minutes later he was out of sight of  barracks and climbing a green slope that led to Brady's bungalow.    In spite of the fact that he had not played his part brilliantly, he  believed that he had scored a triumph. Andy Duggan had not recognized  him, and the riverman had been one of his most intimate friends.  McDowell had accepted him apparently without a suspicion. And Shan  Tung--    It was Shan Tung who weighed heavily upon his mind, even as his nerves  tingled with the thrill of success. He could not get away from the  vision of the Chinaman as he had backed through the Inspector's door,  the flaming needle-points of his eyes piercing him as he went. It was  not hatred he had seen in Shan Tung's face. He was sure of that. It was  no emotion that he could describe. It was as if a pair of mechanical  eyes fixed in the head of an amazingly efficient mechanical monster had  focused themselves on him in those few instants. It made him think of  an X-ray machine. But Shan Tung was human. And he was clever. Given  another skin, one would not have taken him for what he was. The  immaculateness of his speech and manners was more than unusual; it was  positively irritating, something which no Chinaman should rightfully  possess. So argued Keith as he went up to Brady's bungalow.    He tried to throw off the oppression of the thing that was creeping  over him, the growing suspicion that he had not passed safely under the  battery of Shan Tung's eyes. With physical things he endeavored to  thrust his mental uneasiness into the background. He lighted one of the  half-dozen cigars McDowell had dropped into his pocket. It was good to  feel a cigar between his teeth again and taste its flavor. At the crest  of the slope on which Brady's bungalow stood, he stopped and looked  about him. Instinctively his eyes turned first to the west. In that  direction half of the town lay under him, and beyond its edge swept the  timbered slopes, the river, and the green pathways of the plains. His  heart beat a little faster as he looked. Half a mile away was a tiny,  parklike patch of timber, and sheltered there, with the river running  under it, was the old home. The building was hidden, but through a  break in the trees he could see the top of the old red brick chimney  glowing in the sun, as if beckoning a welcome to him over the tree  tops. He forgot Shan Tung; he forgot McDowell; he forgot that he was  John Keith, the murderer, in the overwhelming sea of loneliness that  swept over him. He looked out into the world that had once been his,  and all that he saw was that red brick chimney glowing in the sun, and  the chimney changed until at last it seemed to him like a tombstone  rising over the graves of the dead. He turned to the door of the  bungalow with a thickening in his throat and his eyes filmed by a mist  through which for a few moments it was difficult for him to see.    The bungalow was darkened by drawn curtains when he entered. One after  another he let them up, and the sun poured in. Brady had left his place  in order, and Keith felt about him an atmosphere of cheer that was a  mighty urge to his flagging spirits. Brady was a home man without a  wife. The Company's agent had called his place \"The Shack\" because it  was built entirely of logs, and a woman could not have made it more  comfortable. Keith stood in the big living-room. At one end was a  strong fireplace in which kindlings and birch were already laid,  waiting the touch of a match. Brady's reading table and his easy chair  were drawn up close; his lounging moccasins were on a footstool; pipes,  tobacco, books and magazines littered the table; and out of this  cheering disorder rose triumphantly the amber shoulder of a half-filled  bottle of Old Rye.    Keith found himself chuckling. His grin met the lifeless stare of a  pair of glass eyes in the huge head of an old bull moose over the  mantel, and after that his gaze rambled over the walls ornamented with  mounted heads, pictures, snowshoes, gun-racks and the things which went  to make up the comradeship and business of Brady's picturesque life.  Keith could look through into the little dining-room, and beyond that  was the kitchen. He made an inventory of both and found that McDowell  was right. There were nutcrackers in Brady's establishment. And he  found the bathroom. It was not much larger than a piano box, but the  tub was man's size, and Keith raised a window and poked his head out to  find that it was connected with a rainwater tank built by a genius,  just high enough to give weight sufficient for a water system and low  enough to gather the rain as it fell from the eaves. He laughed  outright, the sort of laugh that comes out of a man's soul not when he  is amused but when he is pleased. By the time he had investigated the  two bedrooms, he felt a real affection for Brady. He selected the  agent's room for his own. Here, too, were pipes and tobacco and books  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4748"],[0,"Baree, Son of Kazan (#8)"],[1," odds whether it wore  feathers or fur, was clawed or hoofed.    He was sore from the Willow's bullet, and he was sore from battle, and  toward dawn he lay down under a shelter of some alders at the edge of a  second small lake and rested until midday. Then he began questing in  the reeds and close to the pond lilies for food. He found a dead  jackfish, partly eaten by a mink, and finished it.    His wound was much less painful this afternoon, and by nightfall he  scarcely noticed it at all. Since his almost tragic end at the hands of  Nepeese, he had been traveling in a general northeasterly direction,  following instinctively the run of the waterways. But his progress had  been slow, and when darkness came again he was not more than eight or  ten miles from the hole into which he had fallen after the Willow had  shot him.    Baree did not travel far this night. The fact that his wound had come  with dusk, and his fight with Oohoomisew still later, filled him with  caution. Experience had taught him that the dark shadows and the black  pits in the forest were possible ambuscades of danger. He was no longer  afraid, as he had once been, but he had had fighting enough for a time,  and so he accepted circumspection as the better part of valor and held  himself aloof from the perils of darkness. It was a strange instinct  that made him seek his bed on the top of a huge rock up which he had  some difficulty in climbing. Perhaps it was a harkening back to the  days of long ago when Gray Wolf, in her first motherhood, sought refuge  at the summit of the Sun Rock which towered high above the forest world  of which she and Kazan were a part, and where later she was blinded in  her battle with the lynx.    Baree's rock, instead of rising for a hundred feet or more straight up,  was possibly as high as a man's head. It was in the edge of the creek  bottom, with the spruce forest close at his back. For many hours he did  not sleep, but lay keenly alert, his ears tuned to catch every sound  that came out of the dark world about him. There was more than  curiosity in his alertness tonight. His education had broadened  immensely in one way: he had learned that he was a very small part of  all this wonderful earth that lay under the stars and the moon, and he  was keenly alive with the desire to become better acquainted with it  without any more fighting or hurt. Tonight he knew what it meant when  he saw now and then gray shadows float silently out of the forest into  the moonlight--the owls, monsters of the breed with which he had  fought. He heard the crackling of hoofed feet and the smashing of heavy  bodies in the underbrush. He heard again the mooing of the moose.  Voices came to him that he had not heard before--the sharp yap-yap-yap  of a fox, the unearthly, laughing cry of a great Northern loon on a  lake half a mile away, the scream of a lynx that came floating through  miles of forest, the low, soft croaks of the nighthawks between himself  and the stars. He heard strange whisperings in the  treetops--whisperings of the wind. And once, in the heart of a dead  stillness, a buck whistled shrilly close behind his rock--and at the  wolf scent in the air shot away in a terror-stricken gray streak.    All these sounds held their new meaning for Baree. Swiftly he was  coming into his knowledge of the wilderness. His eyes gleamed; his  blood thrilled. Often for many minutes at a time he scarcely moved. But  of all the sounds that came to him, the wolf cry thrilled him most.  Again and again he listened to it. At times it was far away, so far  that it was like a whisper, dying away almost before it reached him.  Then again it would come to him full-throated, hot with the breath of  the chase, calling him to the red thrill of the hunt, to the wild orgy  of torn flesh and running blood--calling, calling, calling. That was  it, calling him to his own kin, to the bone of his bone and the flesh  of his flesh--to the wild, fierce hunting packs of his mother's tribe!  It was Gray Wolf's voice seeking for him in the night--Gray Wolf's  blood inviting him to the Brotherhood of the Pack.    Baree trembled as he listened. In his throat he whined softly. He edged  to the sheer face of the rock. He wanted to go; nature was urging him  to go. But the call of the wild was struggling against odds. For in him  was the dog, with its generations of subdued and sleeping  instincts--and all that night the dog in him kept Baree to the top of  his rock.    Next morning Baree found many crayfish along the creek, and he feasted  on their succulent flesh until he felt that he would never be hungry  again. Nothing had tasted quite so good since he had eaten the  partridge of which he had robbed Sekoosew the ermine.    In the middle of the afternoon Baree came into a part of the forest  that was very quiet and very peaceful. The creek had deepened. In  places its banks swept out until they formed small ponds. Twice he made  considerable detours to get around these ponds. He traveled very  quietly, listening and watching. Not since the ill-fated day he had  left the old windfall had he felt quite so much at home as now. It  seemed to him that at last he was treading country which he knew, and  where he would find friends. Perhaps this was another miracle mystery  of instinct--of nature. For he was in old Beaver Tooth's domain. It was  here that his father and mother had hunted in the days before he was  born. It was not far from here that Kazan and Beaver Tooth had fought  that mighty duel under water, from which Kazan had escaped with his  life without another breath to lose.    Baree would never know these things. He would never know that he was  traveling over old trails. But something deep in him gripped him  strangely. He sniffed the air, as if in it he found the scent of  familiar things. It was only a faint breath--an indefinable promise  that brought him to the point of a mysterious anticipation.    The forest grew deeper. It was wonderful virgin forest. There was no  undergrowth, and traveling under the trees was like being in a vast,  mystery-filled cavern through the roof of which the light of day broke  softly, brightened here and there by golden splashes of the sun. For a  mile Baree made his way quietly through this forest. He saw nothing but  a few winged flirtings of birds; there was almost no sound. Then he  came to a still larger pond. Around this pond there was a thick growth  of alders and willows where the larger trees had thinned out. He saw  the glimmer of afternoon sunlight on the water--and then, all at once,  he heard life.    There had been few changes in Beaver Tooth's colony since the days of  his feud with Kazan and the otters. Old Beaver Tooth was somewhat  older. He was fatter. He slept a great deal, and perhaps he was less  cautious. He was dozing on the great mud-and-brushwood dam of which he  had been engineer-in-chief, when Baree came out softly on a high bank  thirty or forty feet away. So noiseless had Baree been that none of the  beavers had seen or heard him. He squatted himself flat on his belly,  hidden behind a tuft of grass, and with eager interest watched every  movement. Beaver Tooth was rousing himself. He stood on his short legs  for a moment; then he tilted himself up on his broad, flat tail like a  soldier at attention, and with a sudden whistle dived into the pond  with a great splash.    In another moment it seemed to Baree that the pond was alive with  beavers. Heads and bodies appeared and disappeared, rushing this way  and that through the water in a manner that amazed and puzzled him. It  was the colony's evening frolic. Tails hit the water like flat boards.  Odd whistlings rose above the splashing--and then as suddenly as it had  begun, the play came to an end. There were probably twenty beavers, not  counting the young, and as if guided by a common signal--something  which Baree had not heard--they became so quiet that hardly a sound  could be heard in the pond. A few of them sank under the water and  disappeared entirely, but most of them Baree could watch as they drew  themselves out on shore.    The beavers lost no time in getting at their labor, and Baree watched  and listened without so much as rustling a blade of the grass in which  he was concealed. He was trying to understand. He was striving to place  these curious and comfortable-looking creatures in his knowledge of  things. They did not alarm him; he felt no uneasiness at their number  or size. His stillness was not the quiet of discretion, but rather of a  strange and growing desire to get better acquainted with this curious  four-legged brotherhood of the pond. Already they had begun to make the  big forest less lonely for him. And then, close under him--not more  than ten feet from where he lay--he saw something that almost gave  voice to the puppyish longing for companionship that was in him.    Down there, on a clean strip of the shore that rose out of the soft mud  of the pond, waddled fat little Umisk and three of his playmates. Umisk  was just about Baree's age, perhaps a week or two younger. But he was  fully as heavy, and almost as wide as he was long. Nature can produce  no four-footed creature that is more lovable than a baby beaver, unless  it is a baby bear; and Umisk would have taken first prize at any beaver  baby show in the world. His three companions were a bit smaller. They  came waddling from behind a low willow, making queer little chuckling  noises, their little flat tails dragging like tiny sledges behind them.  They were fat and furry, and mighty friendly looking to Baree, and his  heart beat a sudden swift-pit-a-pat of joy.    But Baree did not move. He scarcely breathed. And then, suddenly, Umisk  turned on one of his playmates and bowled him over. Instantly the other  two were on Umisk, and the four little beavers rolled over and over,  kicking with their short feet and spatting with their tails, and"]]]
