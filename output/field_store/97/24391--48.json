But, leaving, these references to the many associations attached to the  number five, it must not be supposed that my desire is to make people  unnecessarily timorous about themselves on the score of health. This is  certainly not my intention, for such a frame of mind would defeat the  very object I have in view. Yet there still remains the fact that a  little rational attention is indispensable if the vigour of the body is  to be maintained at its best. There is a very great difference between  carefulness carried to extremes in this respect, on the one head, and a  heedlessness and total disregard of personal health, on the other. The  golden mean between these two is the proper knowledge of what is  required for the preservation of health, and so much conformity thereto  as will give the best results. And yet it must be remembered that no  cast-iron code can be laid down which would be applicable to one and  all. No; idiosyncrasy, that personal peculiarity which makes each  individual different from every one else, is too potent a factor to be  ignored. In matters of this kind, each one, to a certain extent, is a  law unto himself, and, consequently, what agrees and what disagrees is  only discoverable by the individual concerned. In what follows,  therefore, I have endeavoured to lay down rules for guidance which will  be beneficial to by far the greatest number; although this element of  the EGO must never be forgotten.          CHAPTER III.        ABLUTION--THE SKIN AND THE BATH.      It has been estimated that the external skin of an ordinary adult is  equal to an area of about twelve square feet, and that in a tall man it  may be as much as eighteen square feet. There is a considerable  difference between twelve square feet and twelve feet square, and it is  well to mention the fact in order that there may be no confusion. From  this large surface alone, therefore, it is quite easy to see that the  skin requires to have some attention paid to it. But it is really far  more important than even its extensive surface would be likely to  indicate, for it fulfils no less than seven different duties. In the  first place it serves as an external covering to the body, and, as we  shall see also, the internal skin acts as a support to the internal  organs. Secondly, it is endowed with an extensive system of nerves,  which give rise to the sensations of touch, of temperature, of  pressure, and of pain. In this way we can tell whether a substance is  rough or smooth, and whether it is hot or cold; we recognise, moreover,  the difference between a gentle pressure of the hand and one so  forcible as to cause pain. Thirdly, the skin, as we shall find farther  on, contains thousands of small tubes for the purposes of perspiration,  and besides this, there are other tubes secreting, an oily substance.  Fourthly, the skin plays an important part in regulating the  temperature of the body. Thus in a warm atmosphere the skin becomes  reddened and moist, and much heat is lost; on the other hand, when the  air is colder the skin becomes pale, cool, and dry, thus conserving the  body heat. Fifthly, the respiratory action of the skin must not  be forgotten, although it is nothing like so great as that of the  lungs. Nevertheless quite an appreciable amount of oxygen is absorbed  through the skin, and beyond all question carbonic acid is exhaled from  it. Sixthly, it is an absorbent; that is to say, the skin is capable of  absorbing into the body certain substances applied to it. In this way  remedies are often introduced into the system by what is known as  inunction. And lastly, the skin is a great emunctory, and carries off  waste matters from the body. Accordingly it acts as a purifier of the  blood, in which it assists the kidneys, intestines, and the lungs. And  more than this, it often happens that the turning point in any disease  is announced by a sudden, profuse, and markedly offensive perspiration,  as if a considerable amount of deleterious and noxious matter has  suddenly expelled from the system.    From the foregoing it is evident that the skin has many varied and  important duties to perform. As we might expect, moreover, an organ  with such functions is of complicated structure. Its component parts,  therefore, deserve to have some little attention paid to them, since  the importance of the skin from a health point of view will then be all  the more appreciated. The skin is most conveniently considered under  three divisions--the skin itself; the glands, producing perspiration,  oil, and hair, which are found within it; and the appendages belonging  to it, the hair and the nails. The skin itself may be described as the  soft and elastic tissue which invests the whole of the surface of the  body, and consists of two layers, the outer or scarf skin, and the  deeper or true skin. The interior of the body is likewise lined with a  covering, which is termed mucous membrane, from the fact that from its  surface, or from certain special glands within it, or from both, there  is constantly being secreted a thin semi-transparent fluid called  mucus. At the various openings of the body, as the mouth, the  nostrils, and other parts, the external and internal skins are  continuous with one another. Indeed, at these apertures the mucous  membrane, or internal skin, takes leave of absence from the world to  line the cavities within the body. So that, as Professor Huxley  expresses it, \"every part of the body might be said to be contained  within the walls of a double bag, formed by the skin which invests the  outside of the body, and the mucous membrane, its continuation, which  lines the internal cavities.\"    The use of the scarf skin is manifestly to protect the more delicate  true skin, while at the same time it allows the waste products and  used-up material to escape from the body. In the substance of the true  skin are thousands of minute little bodies called papillae, which are  specially concerned in the sense of touch, for the vast majority of  these papillae contain the end of a small nerve. The numberless fine  ridges seen on the palmar surface of the hands and fingers, and on the  soles of the feet, are really rows of these papillae, covered of course  by the layers of the outer skin. The supply of blood to the skin is  also very plenteous, each of its innumerable papillae being abundantly  supplied in this respect. As a proof of the amount of blood circulating  within the skin, and of its extensive nerve supply, it is only  necessary to mention the fact that the finest needle cannot be passed  into it without drawing blood and inflicting-pain. In addition to the  foregoing the skin also contains a countless number of very fine tubes,  which penetrate through its layers and open on its surfaces by minute  openings called pores. There are altogether three different varieties  of these tubes distributed throughout the skin, namely, those intended  for perspiration; secondly, those which lead from the oil glands; and  lastly, those which enclose each hair of the body. The first of these,  which carry away the perspiration from the body, are very fine, the end  away from the surface being coiled up in such a way as to form a  ball or oval-shaped body, constituting the perspiration gland. The tube  itself is also twisted like a corkscrew, and widens at its mouth. It is  estimated that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 of these perspiration  tubes in every square inch of the skin. Now, as we have already seen,  the external skin of an ordinary adult is equal to an area of about  twelve square feet, and in a tall person it may be as much as eighteen  square feet. The number of these tubes, therefore, in the whole body  will be many hundreds of thousands, so that it will readily be seen how  exceedingly important it is that they should be kept in thorough  working order by cleanliness. The two great purposes fulfilled by the  perspiration are the removal by its means of worn-out or effete  material which is injurious to the system, and the regulation of the  heat of the body by its influence. When it is stopped by any reason,  such as catarrh or disease, the skin fails in its work, and the noxious  matters, instead of being expelled from the body, are thrown back into  the system. Hence there is a good deal of truth in the belief that a  freely acting skin is always a safeguard against disease.    The second variety of tubes, those which furnish an oily-like fluid to  the skin, resemble in--great part those which serve for the office of  perspiration. At the extremity away from the surface of the body, each  one has a gland, the oil gland, which secretes the oily material. The  pores or outlets which open on the skin, however, are a good deal  larger than the similar orifices of the perspiratory tubes, but they  are not distributed so equally throughout the body. In certain parts of  the skin they are especially numerous, as on the nose, head, ears, and  back of the shoulders. The unctuous matter which is secreted by these  oil glands is intended to keep the skin moist and pliant, to prevent  the too rapid evaporation of moisture from the surface, and to act as a  lubricant where the folds of the skin are in contact with each  other.

The Seal of Martyrdom.=--\"The highest evidence of sincerity       that a man can give his fellow-men,--the highest proof that he       has spoken the truth in any given case--is that he perseveres in       it unto death, and seals his testimony with his blood.... So       important did such a testimony become in the estimation of Paul,       that he said 'Where a testament is there must also of necessity       be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after       men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the       testator liveth.' (Heb. ix, 16-17.) In the light of this       principle, and when the importance of the great testimony which       he bore to the world is taken into account, it is not to be       wondered at that Joseph Smith was called upon to affix the broad       seal of martyrdom to his life's work. Something of       incompleteness in his work would likely have been complained of       had this been lacking; but now, not so; his character of prophet       was rounded out to complete fulness by his falling a martyr under       the murderous fire of a mob at Carthage in the State of       Illinois.\"--Elder B.

Wm.       Crowell; No. 1; \"_A New Witness for God_,\" by Elder B. H.       Roberts.         =6. Joseph Smith's Descent.=--\"Joseph Smith was of humble birth.       His parents and their progenitors were toilers, but their       characters were godly and their names unstained. Near the middle       of the seventeenth century Robert Smith, a sturdy yeoman of       England, emigrated to the New World, the land of promise. With       his wife, Mary, he settled in Essex, Massachusetts. The numerous       descendants of these worthy people intermarried with many of the       staunchest and most industrious families of New England. Samuel,       the son of Robert and Mary, born January 26th, 1666, wedded       Rebecca Curtis, January 25th, 1707. Their son, the second Samuel,       was born January 26th, 1714; he married Priscilla Gould, and was       the father of Asael, born March 1st, 1744. Asael Smith took to       wife Mary Duty, and their son Joseph was born July 12th, 1771. On       the 24th of January, 1796, Joseph married Lucy Mack at Tunbridge       in the State of Vermont. She was born July 8th, 1776, and was the       daughter of Solomon and Lydia Mack, and was the granddaughter of       Ebenezer Mack.\"--_The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet_, by       George Q. Cannon; Chapter I. Joseph the Prophet was the third son       and fourth child of Joseph and Lucy (Mack) Smith; he was born at       Sharon, Vermont, December 23d, 1805.         =7. The Standard Works of the Church.=--The Bible and the Book of       Mormon--the first two of the standard works of the Church--are to       receive attention in later lectures (see pp. 240-307). The       Doctrine and Covenants is a compilation of modern revelations as       given to the Church in the present dispensation. The _Pearl of       Great Price_ comprises the visions and writings of Moses as       revealed to Joseph Smith, the Book of Abraham--a translation by       Joseph Smith from certain ancient papyri--and some of the       writings of Joseph Smith.         =8. History of the Restored Church.=--Further information       regarding the life work of Joseph Smith, and the growth of the       Church of Jesus Christ as restored to earth through his       instrumentality, may be found in the \"History of the Church of       Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\" Salt Lake City, Utah. For a       brief synopsis of Church history see \"The Story of Mormonism,\" by       James E. Talmage, Liverpool, 1907; Salt Lake City, 1910.         =9. Restoration of the Gospel.=--Plainly the vision-prophecy of       John (Rev. xiv, 6, 7), relating to the restoration of the gospel       to earth, could not refer to the gospel record preserved in the       Holy Bible, for that record has remained in the possession of       mankind. As stated in our text (page 14) a partial fulfilment is       found in the visitation of Moroni and the restoration of the Book       of Mormon, which is to us of modern times a new scripture, and       one containing a fuller record of \"the everlasting gospel.\"       However, a record of the gospel is not the gospel itself.       Authority to administer in the saving ordinances of the gospel is       essential to the effective preaching and administration thereof;       this was restored through John the Baptist, who brought the       Aaronic Priesthood, and through Peter, James, and John who       brought again to earth the Melchizedek Priesthood (see pp. 193,       194 herein). For commentary on Rev. xiv, 6, 7, see \"The Great       Apostasy,\" p. 168.          LECTURE II.    GOD AND THE GODHEAD.         =Article 1.=--We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His       Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.      =1. The Existence of God.=--Since faith in God constitutes the  foundation of religious belief and practice, and inasmuch as a  knowledge of the attributes and character of Deity is essential to an  intelligent exercise of faith in Him, this subject claims first place  in our study of the doctrines of the Church.    =2.= The existence of God is scarcely a question of rational dispute;  nor does it call for proof by the feeble demonstrations of man's  logic, for the fact is admitted by the human family practically  without question, and the consciousness of subjection to a supreme  power is an inborn quality of mankind. The early scriptures are in no  sense devoted to a primary demonstration of God's existence, nor to  attacks on the sophistries of atheism; and from this fact we may infer  that the errors of doubt developed in some period later than the  first. The universal assent of mankind to the existence of God is at  least a strongly corroborative truth. There is a filial passion within  human nature which flames toward heaven. Every nation, every tribe,  every individual, yearns for some object of reverence. It is natural  for man to worship; his soul is unsatisfied till it finds a deity.  When men through transgression first fell into darkness concerning the  true and living God, they established for themselves other deities;  and so arose the abominations of idolatry. And yet, terrible as these  practices are, even the most revolting idolatries testify to the  existence of a God by declaring man's hereditary passion for worship.  Plutarch has wisely remarked of ancient conditions: \"If you search the  world, you may find cities without walls, without letters, without  kings, without money; but no one ever saw a city without a deity,  without a temple, or without prayers.\" This general assent to a belief  in the existence of Deity is testimony of a high order; and in this  connection the words of Aristotle may be applied:--\"What seems true to  some wise men is somewhat probable; what seems true to most or all  wise men is very probable; what most men, both wise and unwise, assent  to, still more resembles truth; but what men generally consent in has  the highest probability, and approaches so near to demonstrated truth,  that it may pass for ridiculous arrogance and self-conceitedness, or  for intolerable obstinacy and perverseness, to decry it.\"[48]      [48] See Notes 1, 2, and 3.    =3.= The multiplicity of evidence upon which mankind rest their  conviction regarding the existence of a Supreme Being, may be  classified, for convenience of consideration, under the three  following heads:    I. The evidence of history and tradition.    II. The evidence furnished by the exercise of human reason.    III. The conclusive evidence of direct revelation from God Himself.    =4. I. History and Tradition.=--History as written by man, and  tradition as transmitted from generation to generation prior to the  date of any written record now extant, give evidence of the actuality  of Deity, and of close and personal dealings between God and man in  the first epochs of human existence. One of the most ancient records  known, the Bible, names God as the Creator of all things,[49] and  moreover, declares that He revealed Himself to our first earthly  parents and to many other holy personages in the early days of the  world. Adam and Eve heard His voice[50] in the Garden, and even after  their transgression they continued to call upon God and to sacrifice  to Him. It is plain, therefore, that they carried with them from the  Garden a knowledge of God. After their expulsion they heard \"the voice  of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden,\" though they saw  Him not; and He gave unto them commandments, which they obeyed. Then  came to Adam an angelic messenger, and the Holy Ghost inspired the man  and bare record of the Father and the Son.[51]      [49] Genesis i; see also Pearl of Great Price, Moses ii, 1.      [50] Genesis iii, 8; and Pearl of Great Price, Moses iv, 14.      [51] Pearl of Great Price, Moses v, 6-9.    =5.= Cain and Abel learned of God from the teachings of their parents,  as well as from personal ministrations. After the acceptance of Abel's  offering, and the rejection of that of Cain followed by Cain's  terrible crime of fratricide, the Lord talked with Cain, and Cain  answered the Lord.[52] Cain must, therefore, have taken a personal  knowledge of God from Eden into the land where he went to dwell.[53]  Adam "]]]
