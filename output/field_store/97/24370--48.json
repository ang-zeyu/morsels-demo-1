Vasari states, that in the villa of the Dukes of  Urbino, named the Imperial, Francesco di Mirozzo, from Forli, had been  employed a long while previous to Dosso; and it would appear that we are  here to substitute the name of Melozzo, to correct one of those errors  which we have so frequently before remarked in Vasari. In the lives of the  Ferrarese painters there is named a Marco Ambrogio, detto Melozzo di  Ferrara, who seems to be confounded with the inventor of foreshortening;  but it is my opinion that this was quite a different artist, of which his  name itself gives us reasons to judge. Melozzo di Forli was still alive in  1494: since F. Luca Paccioli, publishing the same year his \"Summa  d'Aritmetica e Geometria,\" ranks him among painters in perspective, \"_men  famous and supreme_,\" who flourished in those days.         Footnote 10: Morelli Notizie, p. 109.    Towards the beginning of the sixteenth century, or shortly afterwards,  Bartolommeo di Forli flourished in the same city, a pupil of Francia,  noticed by Malvasia, whose style was more dry than that of the generality  of his fellow pupils. Next to him I place Palmegiani, transformed by Vasari  into Parmegiano; a good, yet almost unknown artist, of whom, in books upon  the art, I have found mention only of two works, although I have myself  seen a great number. He was cautious too that posterity should not forget  him, for the most part inscribing his name and country upon his  altar-pieces, and upon pictures for private ornament, as follows: _Marcus  Pictor Foroliviensis_: or _Marcus Palmasanus P. Foroliviensis pinsebat_. He  seldom adds the year, as in two in possession of prince Ercolani, on the  first of which we find the date of 1513, and on the second that of 1537. In  the forementioned pictures, and more particularly in those of Forli, we may  perceive that he practised more than one style. His earliest was in common  with that of the quattrocentisti, in the extremely simple position of the  figures, in the gilt ornaments in study of each minute part, as well as in  the anatomy, which in those times consisted almost wholly in drawing with  some skill a S. Sebastian, or some holy anchorite. In his second manner he  was more artificial in his grouping, fuller in his outlines, and greater in  his proportions; though at times more free and less varied in his heads. He  was accustomed to add to his principal subject some other unconnected with  it, as in his picture of the Crucifixion, at S. Agostino di Forli, where he  inserted two or three groups on different grounds; in one of which is seen  S. Paul visited by S. Antony; in another, S. Augustine convinced by the  angel on the subject of the incomprehensibility of the Supreme Triad; and  in these diminutive figures, which he inserted either in the altar-pieces  or on the steps, he displays an art extremely refined and pleasing. His  landscape is likewise animated, and his architecture beautiful, while his  Madonnas and other portraits are superior in point of beauty to those of  Costa, but not equal to Francia, whose style of colouring he less resembles  than that of Rondinello; a circumstance which led Vasari to attribute to  the artist of Ravenna an altar-piece in the cathedral, undoubtedly from the  hand of Palmegiani. The works of the latter are very numerous in Romagna;  and exist in the state of Venice. One of his Madonnas was in possession of  the Ab. Facciolati, in Padua, and mentioned by Bottari; and another belongs  to the Sig. Dottore Antonio Larber, at Bassano. The select gallery of Count  Luigi Tadini, at Crema, possesses a third; the going up of Jesus to Mount  Calvary; and I saw a Dead Christ, between Nicodemus and Joseph, in the  Vicentini palace at Vicenza; a very beautiful picture, in which the dead  has truly the appearance of death, and those living of real life. I had  long entertained a curiosity to learn whose pupil so considerable an artist  could have been; until I was gratified by finding that Paccioli, in his  dedication of the above cited volume, addressed to Guidubaldo, Duke of  Urbino, calls him the \"attached disciple of Melozzo.\"    I was made acquainted with an artist of Forli, who flourished at the period  of Palmegiani, by his Eminence Card. Borgia, who in the church of S. Maria  dell'Orto, at Velletri, transcribed the following inscription: \"Jo.  Baptista de Rositis de Forlivio pinxit, I. S. O. O. de Mense Martii.\" The  picture is on panel, and displays both good design and good colouring. It  represents the Virgin, with the holy child in her arms, seated in a round  temple supported by four columns, and each of these columns is clasped by  an angel, as if bearing the temple in procession through the air. The  angels are wholly arrayed in heroic dress. For this description I am  indebted to the very worthy cardinal.    In respect to the other cities of Romagna, I can easily suppose that I am  rather in want of materials, than that these have had no artists to boast.  I have recorded, not long since, one Ottaviano, and also one Pace da  Faenza, pupils of Giotto; and there was pointed out to me as the production  of the latter, an ancient figure of our Lady, in a church of the same city,  an edifice formerly belonging to the Templars. Giacomo Filippo Carradori is  included, from his style, among the ancients; in other points it is hardly  possible that he could have reached the fifteenth century. There are more  especially two pictures, in which he exhibits a change of style, although  he never displayed the powers of a superior artist. One of them bears the  date of 1580; the other that of 1582.    Another artist of Faenza better deserved mention in the first edition, but  I had then no account of him. This was Giambatista da Faenza, one of whose  pictures is preserved in the Communal Collection of the Lyceum, with the  author's name, and dated 1506. It exhibits the Holy Virgin; on whose right  two angels support the mantle, and on the steps of the throne appear St.  John the Baptist, a youth, and another cherub, in the act of playing on the  harp. It is correct in point of design, the tints are very pleasing, and  the folds something similar to those of Albert Durer; in other respects,  equal to Costa, and perhaps, also, not inferior to Francia. He was the  father of Jacopone da Faenza, and of his brother, Raffaello, from whom  descended Gio. Batista Bertuzzi, likewise an artist.    There is a Francesco Bandinelli da Imola, a pupil of Francia, pointed out  by Malvasia; and one Gaspero, also of Imola, was employed in painting at  Ravenna. In his native state, there is to be seen, at the Conventual  friars, a picture of our Lady, between Saints Rocco and Francis, in a style  inclining to the modern, accompanied with two portraits, very animated in  point of expression.                           SCHOOL OF BOLOGNA.                         EPOCH II.         _Various styles from the time of Francia to that of the       Caracci._      Subsequent to the discovery of the new style, when every school of Italy  was devoted to its cultivation in the track of one of its masters, the  Bolognese artists having none at home from whom to acquire it, either  removed elsewhere to study it under the eye of living masters, or, if  remaining in their native place, they contrived to attain it from such  foreigners as had there conducted, or at least sent thither their works. Of  these they possessed, besides the St. Cecilia, and a few small paintings by  Raffaello, other productions by his pupils, such as the St. John, coloured  by Giulio, and the St. Zacchary, a work by Garofolo. Nor was it long before  the Lombard style was introduced into Bologna, Parmigianino having there  produced his St. Rocco and his St. Margaret, pictures which are enumerated  among his happiest efforts, and Girolamo da Carpi, and Niccolo dell'Abate  having long resided, and left there many fine specimens of their mixed  style, between the Lombard and the Roman. Another artist sojourning there  was Girolamo da Trevigi, an imitator of Raffaello, not without some mixture  of Venetian taste, some of whose productions are still seen at Bologna. A  still more constant resident there was Tommaso Laureti, a Sicilian, a  pupil, according to Vasari, of Sebastian del Piombo, and assuredly a more  powerful colourist than most of his age. He there conducted a number of  works, and among others the painting of a recess _di sotto in su_, for the  house of Vizzani, which Father Danti, commending Vignola's perspective,  pronounces perfectly unique in its kind. At the same place he left  compositions abounding in figures, displaying much fancy, not however to be  placed in competition with the history of Brutus, which he afterwards  completed, along with several more in the Campidoglio at Rome, where he  long resided and taught. At Bologna is also the altar-piece of Boldraffio,  pupil to Vinci, and various other pieces by a Florentine, who signs himself  _Iul. Flor._ read by some for _Julius_, and by others _Julianus_. Possibly  he might be that Giulian Bugiardini, poor both as inventor and composer,  but excellent in point of copying and colouring. Whoever he may have been,  the whole of his productions, particularly his St. John, which adorns the  Sacristy of St. Stephen's, shew him to have been an imitator of Vinci,  almost on a par with the Luini, and the best known Milanese artists.  Michelangiolo shone there in the character of a statuary in the time of  Julius II., but neither produced any paintings, nor left behind him, among  artists, any wish for his return, having for some little indiscreet word  treated Francia and Costa with the most sovereign contempt, in the same  manner as at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#8)"],[1,"business?

He does give plays, and suppers, and     invites his guests to them, aloud, out of his window, as they     ride by in coaches. He has a lodging in the Strand for the purpose:     or to watch when ladies are gone to the china-houses, or the     Exchange, that he may meet them by chance, and give them presents,     some two or three hundred pounds' worth of toys, to be laugh'd at.     He is never without a spare banquet, or sweet-meats in his chamber,     for their women to alight at, and come up to for a bait.
