The way is a quiet one; it may  be adopted in roads and lanes where the birds dust themselves, and does  not require trespass.    In this connection I may say that I only used a gun when every other  method failed. Game-keepers sometimes try to outwit poachers by a device  which is now of old standing. Usually knowing from what quarter the  latter will enter the covert, wooden blocks representing roosting birds  are nailed to the branches of the open beeches. I was never entrapped  into firing at these dummies, and it is only with the casual that the  ruse acts. He fires, brings the keepers from their hiding places, and is  caught. Still another method of bagging \"long-tails,\" though one  somewhat similar to that already set down: It requires two persons, and  the exact position of the birds must be known. A black night is  necessary; a stiff bamboo rod, and a dark lantern. One man flashes the  concentrated light upon the bare branches, when immediately half a dozen  necks are stretched out to view the apparition. Just then the \"angler\"  slips a wire nooze over the craned neck nearest him, and it is jerked  down as quickly, though as silently as possible. Number two is served in  like manner, then a third, a fourth, and a fifth. This method has the  advantage of silence, though, if unskilfully managed, sometimes only a  single bird is secured, and the rest flutter wildly off into the  darkness.    Poachers often come to untimely ends. Here is an actual incident which  befell one of my companions--as clever a poacher, and as decent and  quiet a man as need be. I saw him on the night previous to the morning  of his death, though he did not see me. It was a night at the end of  October. The winds had stripped the leaves from the trees, and the  dripping branches stood starkly against the sky. I was on the high road  with a vehicle, when plashes of rain began to descend, and a low  muttering came from out the dull leaden clouds. As the darkness  increased, occasional flashes tore zig-zag across the sky, and the rain  set to a dead pour. The lightning only served to increase the darkness.  I could just see the mare's steaming shoulders butting away in front,  and her sensitive ears alternately pricked out on the track. The pitchy  darkness increased, I gave the mare her head, and let the reins hang  loosely on her neck. The lightning was terrible, the thunder almost  continuous, when the mare came to a dead stop. I got down from the trap  and found her trembling violently, with perspiration pouring down her  flanks. All her gear was white with lather, and I thought it best to  lead her on to where I knew was a chestnut tree, and there wait for a  lull in the storm. As I stood waiting, a black lurcher slunk along under  the sodden hedge, and seeing the trap, immediately stopped and turned in  its tracks. Having warned its master, the two reconnoitered and then  came on together. The \"Otter\" (for it was he), bade a gruff \"good-night\"  to the enshrouded vehicle and passed on into the darkness. He slouched  rapidly under the rain, and went in the direction of extensive woods and  coverts. Hundreds of pheasants had taken to the tall trees, and, from  beneath, were visible against the sky. Hares abounded on the fallows,  and rabbits swarmed everywhere. The storm had driven the keepers to  their cosy hearths, and the prospect was a poacher's paradise. Just what  occurred next can only be surmised. Doubtless the \"Otter\" worked long  and earnestly through that terrible night, and at dawn staggered from  the ground under a heavy load.    [Illustration]    Just at dawn the poacher's wife emerged from a poor cottage at the  junction of the roads, and after looking about her as a hunted animal  might look, made quietly off over the land. Creeping closely by the  fences she covered a couple of miles, and then entered a disused,  barn-like building. Soon she emerged under a heavy load, her basket, as  of old, covered with crisp, green cresses. These she had kept from last  evening, when she plucked them in readiness, from the spring. After two  or three journeys she had removed the \"plant,\" and as she eyed the game  her eyes glistened, and she waited now only for _him_. As yet she knew  not that he would never more come--that soon she would be a lone and  heart-broken creature. For, although his life was one long warfare  against the Game Laws, he had always been good and kind to her. His end  had come as it almost inevitably must. The sound of a heavy unknown  footstep on his way home, had turned him from his path. He had then made  back for the lime-kiln to obtain warmth and to dry his sodden clothes.  Once on the margin he was soon asleep. The fumes dulled his senses, and  in his restless sleep he had rolled on to the stones. In the morning the  Limestone Burner coming to work found a handful of pure white ashes. A  few articles were scattered about, and he guessed the rest.    And so the \"Otter\" went to God.... The storm cleared, and the heavens  were calm. In the sky, on the air, in the blades of grass were signs of  awakening life. Morning came bright and fair, birds flew hither and  thither, and the autumn flowers stood out to the sun. All things were  glad and free, but one wretched stricken thing.          [Illustration]    Chapter 7.    SALMON AND TROUT POACHING.        Flashes the blood-red gleam        Over the midnight slaughter;      Wild shadows haunt the stream;        Dark forms glance o'er the water.      It is the leisterers' cry!        A salmon, ho! oho!      In scales of light, the creature bright        Is glimmering below.      Most country poachers begin by loving Nature and end by hating the Game  Laws. Whilst many a man is willing to recognize \"property\" in hares and  pheasants, there are few who will do so with regard to salmon and trout.  And this is why fish poachers have always swarmed. A sea-salmon is in  the domain of the whole world one day; in a trickling runner among the  hills the next. Yesterday it belonged to anybody; and the poacher,  rightly or wrongly, thinks it belongs to him if only he can snatch it.  There are few fish poachers who in their time have not been anglers; and  anglers are of two kinds: there are those who fish fair, and those who  fish foul. The first set are philosophical and cultivate patience: the  second are predatory and catch fish, fairly if they can--but they catch  fish.    [Illustration]    Just as redwings and field-fares constitute the first game of young  gunners, so the loach, the minnow, and the stickleback, are the prey of  the young poacher. If these things are small, they are by no means to be  despised, for there is a tide in the affairs of men when these \"small  fry\" of the waters afford as much sport on their pebbly shallows as do  the silvery-sided salmon in the pools of Strathspay. As yet there is no  knowledge of gaff or click hook--only of a willow wand, a bit of string,  and a crooked pin. The average country urchin has always a considerable  dash of the savage in his composition, and this first comes out in  relation to fish rather than fowl. See him during summer as he wantons  in the stream like a dace. Watch where his brown legs carry him; observe  his stealthy movements as he raises the likely stones; and note the  primitive poaching weapon in his hand. That old pronged fork is every  whit as formidable to the loach and bullhead as is the lister of the  man-poacher to salmon and trout--and the wader uses it almost as  skillfully. He has a bottle on the bank, and into this he pours the fish  unhurt which he captures with his hands. Examine his aquarium, and  hidden among the weeds you will find three or four species of small fry.  The loach, the minnow, and the bullhead are sure to be there, with  perhaps a tiny stickleback, and somewhere, outside the bottle--stuffed  in cap or breeches pocket--crayfish of every age and size. During a long  life I have watched the process, and this is the stuff out of which  fish-poachers are made.    It is part of the wisdom of nature's economy that when furred and  feathered game is \"out,\" fish are \"in.\" It might be thought that  poachers would recognize neither times nor seasons, but this is a  mistake. During fence time game is nearly worthless; and then the  prospective penalties of poaching out of season have to be taken into  account. Fish poaching is practised none the less for the high  preservation and strict watching which so much prevails now-a-days; it  seems even to have grown with them. In outlying country towns with  salmon and trout streams in the vicinity, poaching is carried on to an  almost incredible extent. There are men who live by it and women to whom  it constitutes a thriving trade. The \"Otter,\" more thrifty than the rest  of us, has purchased a cottage with the proceeds of his poaching; and I  know four or five families who live by it. Whilst our class provide the  chief business of the country police courts, and is a great source of  profit to the local fish and game dealer, there is quite another and a  pleasanter side, to the picture. But this later. The wary poacher never  starts for the fishing ground without having first his customer; and it  is surprising with what lax code of morals the provincial public will  deal, when the silent night worker is one to the bargain. Of course the  public always gets cheap fish and fresh fish, so fresh indeed that  sometimes the life has hardly gone out of it. It is a perfectly easy  matter to provide fish and the only difficulty lies in conveying it into  the towns and villages. I never knew but what I might be met by some  county constable, and consequently never carried game upon me. This I  secreted in stack, rick, or disused farm building, until such time as it  could be safely fetched.

Nicholas Mertz.    We are coming very close to the present; and yet still later, in 1847,  when the diocese of Buffalo was formed, there were but sixteen priests  in the sixteen great counties which constituted it. It is superfluous to  contrast that time with the present. There is nothing more striking, to  the student of the history and development of our region during the last  half century, than the increase of the Catholic Church--in parishes and  schools, in means of propaganda, in material wealth with its vast  resources and power for good, and especially in that personal zeal and  unflagging devotion which know no limit and no exhaustion, and are drawn  from the same source of strength that inspired and sustained Brebeuf and  Chaumonot and their fellow-heroes of the cross on the banks of the  Niagara.          The Paschal of the Great Pinch.          THE PASCHAL OF THE GREAT PINCH.         _An Episode in the History of Fort Niagara; being an Extract from       the hitherto unknown Memoirs of the Chevalier De Tregay, Lieutenant       under the Sieur de Troyes, commanding at Fort Denonville (now       called Niagara), in the Year of Starvation 1687; with Captain       Desbergeres at that remote fortress from the joyfull Easter of 1688       till its abandonment; Soldier of His Excellency the Sr. de Brissay,       Marquis de Denonville, Governor and Lieutenant General in New       France; and humble Servitor of His Serene Majesty Louis XIV._      It has been my lot to suffer in many far parts of the earth; to bleed a  little and go hungry for the King; to lie freezing for fame and  France--and gain nothing thereby but a distemper; but so it is to be a  soldier.    And I have seen trouble in my day. I have fought in Flanders on an empty  stomach, and have burned my brain among the Spaniards so that I could  neither fight nor run away; but of all the heavy employment I ever knew,  naught can compare with what befel in the remote parts of New France,  where I was with the troops that the Marquis de Denonville took through  the wilderness into the cantons of the Iroquois, and afterwards employed  to build a stockade and cabins at the mouth of the Strait of Niagara, on  the east side, in the way where they go a beaver-hunting. \"Fort  Denonville,\" the Sieur de Brissay decreed it should be called, for he  held great hopes of the service which it should do him against both the  Iroquois and the English; but now that he has fallen into the disfavor  that has ever been the reward of faithful service in this accursed land,  his name is no more given even to that unhappy spot, but rather it is  called Fort Niagara.    There were some hundreds of us all told that reached that fair plateau,  after we left the river of the Senecas. It was mid-summer of the year of  grace 1687, and we made at first a pleasant camp, somewhat overlooking  the great lake, while to the west side of the point the great river made  good haven for our batteaux and canoes. There was fine stir of air at  night, so that we slept wholesomely, and the wounded began to mend at a  great rate. And of a truth, tho' I have adventured in many lands, I have  seen no spot which in all its demesne offered a fairer prospect to a man  of taste. On the north of us, like the great sea itself, lay the Lake  Ontario, which on a summer morning, when touched by a little wind, with  the sun aslant, was like the lapis lazuli I have seen in the King's  palace--very blue, yet all bright with white and gold. The river behind  the camp ran mightily strong, yet for the most part glassy and green  like the precious green-stone the lapidaries call verd-antique. Behind  us to the south lay the forest, and four leagues away rose the triple  mountains wherein is the great fall; but these are not such mountains as  we have in Italy and Spain, being more of the nature of a great  table-land, making an exceeding hard portage to reach the Strait of  Erie above the great fall.    It was truly a most fit place for a fort, and the Marquis de Denonville  let none in his command rest day or night until we had made a  fortification, in part of earth, surmounted by palisades which the  soldiers cut in the woods. There was much of hazard and fatigue in this  work, for the whole plain about the fort had no trees; so that some of  us went into the forest along the shore to the eastward and some cut  their sticks on the west side of the river. It was hard work, getting  them up the high bank; but so pressed were we, somewhat by fear of an  attack, and even more by the zeal of our commander, that in three days  we had built there a pretty good fort with four bastions, where we put  two great guns and some pattareras; and we had begun to build some  cabins on the four sides of the square in the middle of it. And as we  worked, our number was constantly diminished; for the Sieurs Du Luth and  Durantaye, with that one-handed Chevalier de Tonty of whom they tell so  much, and our allies the savages who had come from the Illinois to join  the Governor in his assault upon the Iroquois, as soon as their wounded  were able to be moved, took themselves off up the Niagara and over the  mountain portage I have spoken of; for they kept a post and place of  trade at the Detroit, and at Michillimackinac. And then presently the  Marquis himself and all whom he would let go sailed away around the  great lake for Montreal. But he ordered that an hundred, officers and  men, stay behind to hold this new Fort Denonville. He had placed in  command over us the Sieur de Troyes, of whom it would not become me to  speak in any wise ill.    There were sour looks and sad, as the main force marched to the  batteaux. But the Marquis did not choose to heed anything of that. We  were put on parade for the embarkation--though we made a sorry show of  it, for there were even then more rags than lace or good leather--and  His Excellency spoke a farewell word in the hearing of us all.    \"You are to complete your quarters with all convenient expediency,\" he  said to De Troyes, who stood attentive, before us. \"There will be no  lack of provision sent. You have here in these waters the finest fish in  the world. There is naught to fear from these Iroquois wasps--have we  not just torn to pieces their nests?\"    He said this with a fine bravado, though methought he lacked somewhat of  sincerity; for surely scattered wasps might prove troublesome enough to  those of us who stayed behind. But De Troyes made no reply, and saluted  gravely. And so, with a jaunty word about the pleasant spot where we  were to abide, and a light promise to send fresh troops in the spring,  the General took himself off, and we were left behind to look out for  the wasps. As the boats passed the sandbar and turned to skirt the lake  shore to the westward, we gave them a salvo of musketry; but De Troyes  raised his hand--although the great Marquis was yet in sight and almost  in hailing distance--and forbade another discharge.    \"Save your powder,\" was all he said; and the very brevity of it seemed  to mean more than many words, and put us into a low mood for that whole  day.    Now for a time that followed there was work enough to keep each man  busy, which is best for all who are in this trade of war, especially in  the wilderness. It was on the third of August that M. de Brissay left  us, he having sent off some of the militia ahead of him; and he bade M.  de Vaudreuil stay behind for a space, to help the Sieur de Troyes  complete the fort and cabins, and this he did right ably, for as all  Canada and the King himself know, M. de Vaudreuil was a man of exceeding  great energy and resources in these matters. There was a vast deal of  fetching and carrying, of hewing and sawing and framing. And  notwithstanding that the sun of that climate was desperately hot the men  worked with good hearts, so that there was soon finished an excellent  lodgment for the commandant; with a chimney of sticks and clay, and  boards arranged into a sort of bedstead; and this M. de Troyes shared  with M. de Vaudreuil, until such time as the latter gentleman quit us.  There were three other cabins built, with chimneys, doors and little  windows. We also constructed a baking-house with a large oven and  chimney, partly covered with boards and the remainder with hurdles and  clay. We also built an extensive framed building without chimney, and a  large store-house with pillars eight feet high, and made from time to  time yet other constructions for the men and goods--though, _Dieu  defend_! we had spare room for both, soon enough. In the square in the  midst of the buildings we digged a well; and although the water was  sweet enough, yet from the first, for lack of proper curbing and  protection, it was ever much roiled and impure when we drew it, a  detriment alike to health and cookery.    M. de Vaudreuil seeing us at last well roofed, and having directed for a  little the getting of a store of firewood, made his adieux. Even then,  in those fine August days, a spirit of discontent was among us, and more  than one spark of a soldier, who at the first camp had been hot upon  staying on the Niagara, sought now to be taken in M. de Vaudreuil's  escort. But that gentleman replied, that he wished to make a good report  of us all to the Governor, and that, for his part, he hoped he might  come to us early in the spring, with the promised detachment of troops.  And so we parted.    Now the spring before, when we had all followed the Marquis de  Denonville across Lake Ontario to harass the cantons of the Iroquois,  this establishment of a post on the Niagara was assuredly a part of that  gentleman's plan. It is not for me, who am but a mere lieutenant of  marines, to show how a great commander"]]]
