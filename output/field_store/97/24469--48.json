Save me this minute, or I shall die of terror.\"    Indeed, as she spoke she fell down insensible, and when she recovered  she found herself in her own little bed at home; how she got there  she could not tell, but she was dressed in the most beautiful lace and  ribbons, and on her finger was a little ring, made of a single red hair,  which fitted so tightly that, try as she might, she could not get it  off.    When the Princess saw all these things, and remembered what had  happened, she, too, fell into the deepest sadness, which surprised and  alarmed the whole Court, and the Queen more than anyone else. A hundred  times she asked Bellissima if anything was the matter with her; but she  always said that there was nothing.    At last the chief men of the kingdom, anxious to see their Princess  married, sent to the Queen to beg her to choose a husband for her as  soon as possible. She replied that nothing would please her better, but  that her daughter seemed so unwilling to marry, and she recommended them  to go and talk to the Princess about it themselves so this they at once  did. Now Bellissima was much less proud since her adventure with the  Yellow Dwarf, and she could not think of a better way of getting rid  of the little monster than to marry some powerful king, therefore she  replied to their request much more favorably than they had hoped, saying  that, though she was very happy as she was, still, to please them, she  would consent to marry the King of the Gold Mines. Now he was a very  handsome and powerful Prince, who had been in love with the Princess for  years, but had not thought that she would ever care about him at all.  You can easily imagine how delighted he was when he heard the news,  and how angry it made all the other kings to lose for ever the hope of  marrying the Princess; but, after all, Bellissima could not have married  twenty kings--indeed, she had found it quite difficult enough to choose  one, for her vanity made her believe that there was nobody in the world  who was worthy of her.    Preparations were begun at once for the grandest wedding that had ever  been held at the palace. The King of the Gold Mines sent such immense  sums of money that the whole sea was covered with the ships that brought  it. Messengers were sent to all the gayest and most refined Courts,  particularly to the Court of France, to seek out everything rare and  precious to adorn the Princess, although her beauty was so perfect that  nothing she wore could make her look prettier. At least that is what  the King of the Gold Mines thought, and he was never happy unless he was  with her.    As for the Princess, the more she saw of the King the more she liked  him; he was so generous, so handsome and clever, that at last she was  almost as much in love with him as he was with her. How happy they were  as they wandered about in the beautiful gardens together, sometimes  listening to sweet music! And the King used to write songs for  Bellissima. This is one that she liked very much:      In the forest all is gay    When my Princess walks that way.    All the blossoms then are found    Downward fluttering to the ground,    Hoping she may tread on them.    And bright flowers on slender stem    Gaze up at her as she passes    Brushing lightly through the grasses.    Oh! my Princess, birds above    Echo back our songs of love,    As through this enchanted land    Blithe we wander, hand in hand.      They really were as happy as the day was long. All the King's  unsuccessful rivals had gone home in despair. They said good-by to the  Princess so sadly that she could not help being sorry for them.    \"Ah! madam,\" the King of the Gold Mines said to her \"how is this? Why  do you waste your pity on these princes, who love you so much that all  their trouble would be well repaid by a single smile from you?\"    \"I should be sorry,\" answered Bellissima, \"if you had not noticed how  much I pitied these princes who were leaving me for ever; but for you,  sire, it is very different: you have every reason to be pleased with  me, but they are going sorrowfully away, so you must not grudge them my  compassion.\"    The King of the Gold Mines was quite overcome by the Princess's  good-natured way of taking his interference, and, throwing himself at  her feet, he kissed her hand a thousand times and begged her to forgive  him.    At last the happy day came. Everything was ready for Bellissima's  wedding. The trumpets sounded, all the streets of the town were hung  with flags and strewn with flowers, and the people ran in crowds to the  great square before the palace. The Queen was so overjoyed that she had  hardly been able to sleep at all, and she got up before it was light to  give the necessary orders and to choose the jewels that the Princess was  to wear. These were nothing less than diamonds, even to her shoes, which  were covered with them, and her dress of silver brocade was embroidered  with a dozen of the sun's rays. You may imagine how much these had cost;  but then nothing could have been more brilliant, except the beauty of  the Princess! Upon her head she wore a splendid crown, her lovely  hair waved nearly to her feet, and her stately figure could easily be  distinguished among all the ladies who attended her.    The King of the Gold Mines was not less noble and splendid; it was easy  to see by his face how happy he was, and everyone who went near him  returned loaded with presents, for all round the great banqueting hall  had been arranged a thousand barrels full of gold, and numberless bags  made of velvet embroidered with pearls and filled with money, each one  containing at least a hundred thousand gold pieces, which were given  away to everyone who liked to hold out his hand, which numbers of people  hastened to do, you may be sure--indeed, some found this by far the most  amusing part of the wedding festivities.    The Queen and the Princess were just ready to set out with the King when  they saw, advancing toward them from the end of the long gallery, two  great basilisks, dragging after them a very badly made box; behind them  came a tall old woman, whose ugliness was even more surprising than her  extreme old age. She wore a ruff of black taffeta, a red velvet hood,  and a farthingale all in rags, and she leaned heavily upon a crutch.  This strange old woman, without saying a single word, hobbled three  times round the gallery, followed by the basilisks, then stopping in the  middle, and brandishing her crutch threateningly, she cried:    \"Ho, ho, Queen! Ho, ho, Princess! Do you think you are going to break  with impunity the promise that you made to my friend the Yellow Dwarf? I  am the Fairy of the Desert; without the Yellow Dwarf and his orange  tree my great lions would soon have eaten you up, I can tell you, and in  Fairyland we do not suffer ourselves to be insulted like this. Make up  your minds at once what you will do, for I vow that you shall marry the  Yellow Dwarf. If you don't, may I burn my crutch!\"    \"Ah! Princess,\" said the Queen, weeping, \"what is this that I hear? What  have you promised?\"    \"Ah! my mother,\" replied Bellissima sadly, \"what did _you_ promise,  yourself?\"    The King of the Gold Mines, indignant at being kept from his happiness  by this wicked old woman, went up to her, and threatening her with his  sword, said:    \"Get away out of my country at once, and for ever, miserable creature,  lest I take your life, and so rid myself of your malice.\"    He had hardly spoken these words when the lid of the box fell back on  the floor with a terrible noise, and to their horror out sprang the  Yellow Dwarf, mounted upon a great Spanish cat. \"Rash youth!\" he cried,  rushing between the Fairy of the Desert and the King. \"Dare to lay a  finger upon this illustrious Fairy! Your quarrel is with me only. I  am your enemy and your rival. That faithless Princess who would have  married you is promised to me. See if she has not upon her finger a ring  made of one of my hairs. Just try to take it off, and you will soon find  out that I am more powerful than you are!\"    \"Wretched little monster!\" said the King; \"do you dare to call yourself  the Princess's lover, and to lay claim to such a treasure? Do you know  that you are a dwarf--that you are so ugly that one cannot bear to look  at you--and that I should have killed you myself long before this if you  had been worthy of such a glorious death?\"    The Yellow Dwarf, deeply enraged at these words, set spurs to his  cat, which yelled horribly, and leaped hither and thither--terrifying  everybody except the brave King, who pursued the Dwarf closely, till he,  drawing a great knife with which he was armed, challenged the King to  meet him in single combat, and rushed down into the courtyard of the  palace with a terrible clatter. The King, quite provoked, followed him  hastily, but they had hardly taken their places facing one another, and  the whole Court had only just had time to rush out upon the balconies to  watch what was going on, when suddenly the sun became as red as blood,  and it was so dark that they could scarcely see at all. The thunder  crashed, and the lightning seemed as if it must burn up everything; the  two basilisks appeared, one on each side of the bad Dwarf, like giants,  mountains high, and fire flew from their mouths and ears, until they  looked like flaming furnaces. None of these things could terrify the  noble young King, and the boldness of his looks and actions reassured  those who were looking on, and perhaps even embarrassed the Yellow Dwarf  himself; but even _his_ courage gave way when he saw what was happening  to his beloved Princess.

But when Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon had to  flee from Kirtland for their lives, in the spring of 1838, the press  and type on which the _Journal_ was printed were removed to Far West.  Here an effort was made to re-issue the _Journal_, Sidney Rigdon being  appointed editor. But again the assembling of angry mobs hindered the  work. And the night that General Lucas' mob-militia force surrounded  Far West, this press and type were buried in the dooryard of a brother  by the name of Dawson. The form for a number of the _Elders' Journal_  was buried, with the ink on it, in the hurry to get it safely hidden  from the enemy. It remained in its grave until taken up by Elias Smith,  Hyrum Clark and some others, and taken to Commerce, where, in the fall  of 1839, it was set up in a cellar, through which a spring of water was  running, and on it was published the _Times and Seasons_.    This periodical was issued first as a sixteen page monthly, but  afterwards became semi-monthly. Its first editor and manager was Don  Carlos Smith, the youngest brother of Joseph Smith, who learned the  printer's art in the office of Oliver Cowdery, and at the time he took  charge of the _Times and Seasons_ was but twenty-four years of age.  His associate was Ebenezer Robinson. The paper was first issued in  November, 1839.    Don Carlos Smith continued to act as editor of this paper until his  death, which occurred on the seventh of August, 1841. Ebenezer Robinson  then became the editor and Elder Robert B. Thompson was appointed  to assist him. The manner in which the paper was conducted was very  unsatisfactory to The Church authorities, and the Twelve Apostles  took charge of it with Elders John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff as  its managers, and President Joseph Smith as editor-in-chief. It was  conducted by these parties for about a year, when the Prophet Joseph  resigned the editorial chair, and Elder John Taylor was assigned to the  position of chief editor, and kept that place until the discontinuance  of the publication, in consequence of the Saints being driven from  Nauvoo. It was a valuable means of communication for The Church  authorities, as they were enabled to reach the Saints through its  columns notwithstanding their scattered condition; and in its pages  are collected the principal historical events which occurred in the  early days of The Church; which, in connection with the principles and  doctrine expounded by its editors, and the communications from the  Prophet, make it of inestimable value to the student of Church history  or the development of Church doctrine.        CHAPTER IX.    AN APPEAL TO THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT FOR REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES.    IT will be remembered by those who have read \"The Missouri  Persecutions,\" that Sidney Rigdon was released from prison in Liberty,  Missouri, before Joseph and the other brethren escaped. On his arrival  in Quincy, his position as one of the presidents of The Church, his  education and eloquence, gave him the attention of the leading citizens  of Quincy, and particularly enlisted the sympathy of Governor Carlin,  of Illinois. By coming in contact with him, and relating the cruelties  practiced against the Saints in Missouri, he conceived the altogether  fanciful and utterly impracticable idea of impeaching the charter  of Missouri on an item in the Constitution, viz: \"that the general  government shall give to each State a republican form of government.\"  And it was his point to prove that such a government did not exist in  Missouri. His plan was to present the story of the Saints' wrongs to  the governors of the respective States, before the assembly of the  several legislatures, and induce as many of them as possible to bring  the case before the legislatures in their messages. Another part of the  plan was to have a man at each State capital armed with affidavits that  would give the necessary information to the legislatures. After the  action of the State legislatures the case was to be presented to the  national Congress for its consideration and action.    To carry out his plans George W. Robinson was appointed to take  affidavits and collect general information bearing on the subject, and  Sidney Rigdon himself secured letters of introduction to the governors  of several States and to the President of the United States from  Governor Carlin, of Illinois, and Governor Robert Lucas, of Iowa. On  the fifth of May, 1839, however, at a conference of The Church held  near Quincy, Joseph Smith presiding, the gigantic and fanciful scheme  conceived by Sidney Rigdon was considered and somewhat reduced of its  unwieldy proportions by the conference simply resolving:        That this conference send a delegate to the city of Washington to      lay our case before the general government; and that President      Rigdon be the delegate: and that Colonel Lyman Wight be appointed      to receive the affidavits which are to be sent to the city of      Washington.    Here the matter rested for a time through the inactivity of President  Rigdon, whose ardor in the work of God about this time began to wane.    In consequence of the inactivity and lack of interest manifested  by Sidney Rigdon in going to Washington to present the case of the  Latter-day Saints _vs_. the State of Missouri to the President and  Congress of the United States, at a High Council meeting, held at  Commerce on the twentieth of October, 1839, the Prophet Joseph was  appointed to be the delegate to Washington, and a few days later Sidney  Rigdon and Elias Higbee were appointed by the same council to assist  him in this mission.    As a contrast between the two men, Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith,  I call attention to the fact that after his appointment to go to  Washington to petition the general government for a redress of  grievances, in behalf of the Saints, Sidney Rigdon had allowed nearly  six months to pass away without doing anything; but the ninth day after  Joseph was appointed to this mission he was found leaving Commerce  with a two-horse carriage, accompanied by Rigdon, Higbee and Orin P.  Rockwell, _en route_ for Washington. The Prophet was always prompt in  action. There were no tedious delays in anything he under took; no  letting \"I dare not wait upon I would, like the old cat 'i the adage.\"  His motto for the commencement of his career had been, \"When the Lord  commands, do it.\" And it was pretty much the same thing when a council  of the Priesthood, or himself individually, had determined upon any  particular course of action, he at once set himself about performing it.    The mission for the city of Washington passed through Springfield,  the capital of the State of Illinois, on their journey, and here met  with Dr. Robert D. Foster, who afterwards, as we shall see, became  prominently connected with events at Nauvoo. Elder Rigdon being ill,  Dr. Foster administered medicines to him, journeying with Joseph's  party for several days for that purpose. At last, however, Elder Rigdon  became so weak that it became necessary to leave him near Columbus,  Ohio; and Orin P. Rockwell and Dr. Foster remained with him, while  Joseph and Judge Higbee continued their journey to Washington.    It was during this journey, too, that Joseph met another man destined  to perform a prominent part in the drama enacted at Nauvoo. This was  William Law, whom Joseph's party met at Springfield, Illinois. He was  then leading a small company of Saints from Canada to Nauvoo. Joseph's  company remained several days at Springfield, and he preached there  several times, staying at the home of James Adams, the probate judge  of that county. Judge Adams treated the Prophet with the kindness of a  father.    An incident occurred as the party approached Washington which borders  on the domain of the romantic, or perhaps may be considered to enter  directly into it. The coachman stopped his horses in front of one of  the many public houses they passed _en route_, to get his grog, when  the horses took fright, and dashed down the road at break-neck speed.  The passengers, as might be expected, became terror-stricken, and one  woman in her excitement tried to throw her babe out of the window; she  was prevented, however, by Joseph, who calmed her fears, and persuaded  the rest of the passengers to keep their seats. He then opened the door  of the coach and succeeded in climbing up the side of the vehicle, and  reaching the driver's seat. Gathering up the reins, he stopped the  horses before any accident occurred either to coach or passengers.    It is needless to say that Joseph's heroism drew from his  fellow-passengers their warmest expressions of admiration and  gratitude. No terms were sufficiently strong to convey their admiration  of his daring. Among the passengers were several members of Congress  who proposed mentioning the incident to Congress, for they believed  that body would reward Joseph's conduct by some public act. With this  object in view they asked for his name, and were doubtless dumbfounded  to learn that they had been saved from their imminent peril by the  courage of the Mormon Prophet. At any rate the profusion of thanks  and admiration was stayed, \"and,\" says Joseph, \"I heard no more of  their praise, gratitude or reward.\" Need one stop to moralize on the  littleness of man when he allows prejudice to dictate his action  instead of reason?    It was on the twenty-eighth of November, 1839, that Joseph and Judge  Elias Higbee arrived in Washington, and took up their abode at an  unpretentious boarding house, on the corner of Missouri and Third  Streets. They were very much cramped on account of means, as the  people they represented were poor in this world's goods, and unable to  supply the means necessary to enable their delegates to indulge in the  luxurious style of living usually adopted by those who go to the seat  of government on special missions.
