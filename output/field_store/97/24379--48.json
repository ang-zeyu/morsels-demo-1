Curiously enough, after all the fighting, the sum total of prisoners of  war on both sides was now nearly equal. By the 23rd of March the Boer  prisoners in our hands were 5000, while the British prisoners in  Pretoria numbered some 3466. Since that date, through various unlucky  accidents, the Boers had captured some 1000 more of our troops, and thus  early in April the enemy almost equalled us in the matter of capture!    [Illustration: THE MODEL SCHOOL, PRETORIA.]    The Model School stands in the centre of the town. It is commodious,  though devoid of privacy (on the principle of a boys' dormitory) well  ventilated, lighted with electricity, and roofed with corrugated iron.  At the time of the escape there was a gymnasium, and also a  scaling-ladder against the wall, which suggested infinite possibilities  to such men as Captain Haldane, who had all the exciting histories of  \"Latude,\" \"Jack Sheppard,\" and \"Monte Christo\" at his fingers' ends.  There were rough screens to enclose some of the cubicles, and the walls  in some cases were decorated with cuttings from the illustrated papers,  or with humorous sketches made by talented amateurs. Two of these were  especially admired, a chase after President Steyn personally conducted  by Lord Roberts, and a caricature of President Kruger, which latter was  highly appreciated even by the Boers when it came under their notice.    The special nook of the Rev. Adrian Hofmeyer, who had made himself into  a general favourite, and was laconically declared to be a \"regular  brick,\" was the most decorative of all, being made gay with various  scraps of colour and design to cheer the weary eye. By this time the  reverend gentleman, having had a more trying experience of incarceration  than most, had got to look upon the Model School in the light of  residential chambers, and consoled others with the account of his own  experiences. His story was not an enlivening one:--         \"I was lodged in the common jail, Cronje's law adviser having       informed him it would not be legal to shoot me. Cronje       consequently thought the best thing to do would be another       illegality, namely, imprison a non-combatant and correspondent.       Mr. Cronje has ample time to-day in St. Helena to meditate upon       this and other illegal acts of his. I was locked up in a cell       eighteen feet by nine feet, and for the first few days was       allowed to have my meals at the hotel. Soon, however, this       liberty was taken away, for it proved too much for the       Christian charity of the Zeerust burghers to see a despised       prisoner of war marched up and down from the hotel to the jail       under police escort. Other restrictions were soon imposed also,       and after a little while I was locked up day and night, the       door of the unventilated cell being open only three times a day       for fifteen minutes at a time. No books nor papers were allowed       me, no visitors, and the few loyal friends who tried to supply       me with luxuries were cruelly forbidden to do so by the       authorities. I cannot help thinking to-day of the strange irony       of fate. The commanders who practised this cruelty upon me were       Cronje and Snyman. The one is to-day a prisoner of war, and       can, perhaps, put himself in my place. He is an old personal       acquaintance, too.\"    The worthy padre was afterwards removed, and gave a further description  of his experiences.         \"After eight weeks of such life I was taken to Pretoria, and       there quartered in the Staats Model School with the British       officers. Here everything was better, and I quickly recovered       my health and strength. The building was a magnificent one, and       the surroundings very pleasant, but our jailer, a Landdrost,       and our guards, the Zarps, never forgot to remind us of the       fact that we were prisoners. The food we got from Government       sufficed for one meal; the rest we had to buy, being charged       most exorbitant prices. When I left, the officers' mess       amounted to L1600 per month for 144 officers. On my arrival, I       was asked by the officers to conduct service for them every       Sunday, in addition to that held by an Anglican clergyman. For       two Sundays, therefore, we had two services a day, and then       Winston Churchill escaped, and the following extraordinary       letter was sent the officers by the Anglican clergyman:--         \"'GENTLEMEN,--By the kind courtesy of the Government, I have       been permitted to hold services for you in connection with the       Church of England, which services I have felt it a privilege on       my part to conduct. After what has recently occurred--viz. the       escape of Mr. Churchill from confinement--I exceedingly regret       that, in consideration of my duty to the Government, I must       discontinue such regular ministrations, as I desire to maintain       the honour due to my position. Of course I shall always be glad       to minister to you in any emergency, with the special       permission of the authorities, who will, with their usual       kindness, duly inform me.--With my best wishes, I am,       gentlemen, yours sincerely, ----.'         \"Out of charity, I do not publish the reverend gentleman's       name,[2] but I can add that 'the emergency' referred to never       presented itself. Since that time, I had the pleasure and       honour of conducting the services every Sunday, and they were       the pleasantest hours I spent in prison. Our singing was so       hearty and good, that many of the townsfolk strolled up of a       Sunday morning to hear us.\"    [Illustration: BRITISH PRISONERS ON THEIR WAY TO PRETORIA: THE FIRST  HALT    Drawing by S. Begg]    As may be imagined, all manner of devices were invented for the purpose  of securing news, the only intelligence of outside events coming to the  unhappy prisoners through the _Standard and Diggers' News_, which  journal, of course, dwelt gloatingly on British disasters. But the  authorities were suspicious. One day a harmonium was removed, owing to  the treasonable practice of performing \"God save the Queen\"; on another,  a cherished terrier was banished, as he was declared to be a smuggler,  and charged with the crime of carrying notes in his tail! But at last,  an ingenious ruse was successfully perpetrated. A man, accompanied by a  dog, came to the railings and there engaged in a private dialogue, which  savoured of the maniacal, till the eagerly listening officers discovered  that there might be method in the strange man's madness. A sample of the  scene was given by the correspondent of the _Standard_:--    \"'Would you like a swim?' asked the master, and the dog, with a wag of  his tail, answered 'Yes.' 'Ladysmith is all right,' continued the man,  and the tail wagged assent. 'We will come again,' said the master, and  the dog agreed. For a time the prisoners thought him mad, this man with  the dog who talked in his beard, and mixed his dog talk with such names  as 'Ladysmith,' 'Mafeking,' 'Cronje,' 'Roberts.' Then the truth dawned  on them, and the 'Dog Man' became a hero, whose coming was watched with  longing, and whose mutterings in his beard were 'as cool waters to the  thirsty soul,' or as 'good news from a far country.' One day the 'Dog  Man' was missing, and there was lamentation, until, looking towards the  house opposite, the prisoners saw him standing well back in the passage,  at the entrance to which two girls kept watch. The 'Dog Man' was waving  his hat in eccentric fashion, and the waving was found to be legible to  those who understand signalling. Next morning a tiny flag was  substituted for the hat, and communication between the officers and the  Director of Telegraphs was established by flag signal.\"    The prisoners endeavoured to keep up an air of jocosity, though, as  one confessed, their tempers were \"very short and inclined to be  captious.\" Naturally their occupations were limited, and it was not  unusual to see gallant commanders engaged in darning their socks, or  washing their clothes under the pump. Their attire, too, was not of the  choicest, some of them having been accommodated when sick with suits  technically known as \"slops,\" purchased for a low price in Johannesburg.  Hence one officer disported himself in choice pea-green, while another  figured in rich yellow. These prison suits were scarcely becoming,  particularly as many of the smartest of the smart were growing beards,  or, if not beards, the ungainly chin tuft or \"Charley,\" which destroyed  their martial aspect. Sometimes they engaged in games, bumble puppy and  the like, and occasionally expanded to other sports. A letter from a  sprightly member of the band to the _Eton College Chronicle_ described  the humorous side of their daily life:--         \"MODEL SCHOOL, PRETORIA.         \"DEAR MR. EDITOR,--Whilst following the fortunes of old       Etonians in South Africa, perhaps it may have escaped your       notice that a small and unhappy band has already reached       Pretoria.

Chandos-Pole-Gell (Coldstream       Guards); Mr. Carter's by Major Foster (Royal Artillery); the       late Mr. Dalton's, Mr. Ainger's, and Mr. Luxmore's respectively       by M.

The       histories of their separate captures would take up too much of       your valuable space.

And women feel the same for worthy men.      [20] Guido Guinicelli, in the canzone which begins, \"Within the         gentle heart Love shelters him.\"    _This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first, I speak of him  according to his power. In the second, I speak of him according as  his power translates itself into act. The second part begins here,  \"Then beauty seen.\" The first is divided into two. In the first, I  say in what subject this power exists. In the second, I say how this  subject and this power are produced together, and how the one regards  the other, as form does matter. The second begins here, \"'Tis Nature.\"  Afterwards when I say, \"Then beauty seen in virtuous womankind,\" I  say how this power translates itself into act; and, first, how it  so translates itself in a man, then how it so translates itself in a  woman: here, \"And women feel.\"_    Having treated of love in the foregoing, it appeared to me that I  should also say something in praise of my lady, wherein it might be  set forth how love manifested itself when produced by her; and how not  only she could awaken it where it slept, but where it was not she could  marvellously create it. To the which end I wrote another sonnet; and it  is this:--        My lady carries love within her eyes;        All that she looks on is made pleasanter;        Upon her path men turn to gaze at her;      He whom she greeteth feels his heart to rise,      And droops his troubled visage, full of sighs,        And of his evil heart is then aware:        Hate loves, and pride becomes a worshipper.      O women, help to praise her in somewise.      Humbleness, and the hope that hopeth well,        By speech of hers into the mind are brought,          And who beholds is blessed oftenwhiles.          The look she hath when she a little smiles        Cannot be said, nor holden in the thought;      'Tis such a new and gracious miracle.    _This sonnet has three sections. In the first, I say how this lady  brings this power into action by those most noble features, her eyes;  and, in the third, I say this same as to that most noble feature, her  mouth. And between these two sections is a little section, which asks,  as it were, help for the previous section and the subsequent; and it  begins here, \"O women, help.\" The third begins here, \"Humbleness.\" The  first is divided into three; for, in the first, I say how she with  power makes noble that which she looks upon; and this is as much as  to say that she brings Love, in power, thither where he is not. In the  second, I say how she brings Love, in act, into the hearts of all those  whom she sees. In the third, I tell what she afterwards, with virtue,  operates upon their hearts. The second begins, \"Upon her path;\" the  third, \"He whom she greeteth.\" Then, when I say, \"O women, help,\" I  intimate to whom it is my intention to speak, calling on women to help  me to honour her. Then, when I say, \"Humbleness,\" I say that same which  is said in the first part, regarding two acts of her mouth, one whereof  is her most sweet speech, and the other her marvellous smile. Only, I  say not of this last how it operates upon the hearts of others, because  memory cannot retain this smile, nor its operation._    Not many days after this (it being the will of the most High God,  who also from Himself put not away death), the father of wonderful  Beatrice, going out of this life, passed certainly into glory. Thereby  it happened, as of very sooth it might not be otherwise, that this lady  was made full of the bitterness of grief: seeing that such a parting  is very grievous unto those friends who are left, and that no other  friendship is like to that between a good parent and a good child;  and furthermore considering that this lady was good in the supreme  degree, and her father (as by many it hath been truly averred) of  exceeding goodness. And because it is the usage of that city that men  meet with men in such a grief, and women with women, certain ladies  of her companionship gathered themselves unto Beatrice, where she kept  alone in her weeping: and as they passed in and out, I could hear them  speak concerning her, how she wept. At length two of them went by me,  who said: \"Certainly she grieveth in such sort that one might die for  pity, beholding her.\" Then, feeling the tears upon my face, I put up  my hands to hide them: and had it not been that I hoped to hear more  concerning her (seeing that where I sat, her friends passed continually  in and out), I should assuredly have gone thence to be alone, when I  felt the tears come. But as I still sat in that place, certain ladies  again passed near me, who were saying among themselves: \"Which of us  shall be joyful any more, who have listened to this lady in her piteous  sorrow?\" And there were others who said as they went by me: \"He that  sitteth here could not weep more if he had beheld her as we have beheld  her;\" and again: \"He is so altered that he seemeth not as himself.\" And  still as the ladies passed to and fro, I could hear them speak after  this fashion of her and of me.    Wherefore afterwards, having considered and perceiving that there was  herein matter for poesy, I resolved that I would write certain rhymes  in the which should be contained all that those ladies had said. And  because I would willingly have spoken to them if it had not been for  discreetness, I made in my rhymes as though I had spoken and they had  answered me. And thereof I wrote two sonnets; in the first of which  I addressed them as I would fain have done; and in the second related  their answer, using the speech that I had heard from them, as though it  had been spoken unto myself. And the sonnets are these:--      I.        You that thus wear a modest countenance        With lids weigh'd down by the heart's heaviness,        Whence come you, that among you every face      Appears the same, for its pale troubled glance?      Have you beheld my lady's face, perchance,        Bow'd with the grief that Love makes full of grace?        Say now, \"This thing is thus;\" as my heart says,      Marking your grave and sorrowful advance.      And if indeed you come from where she sighs        And mourns, may it please you (for his heart's relief)          To tell how it fares with her unto him      Who knows that you have wept, seeing your eyes,        And is so grieved with looking on your grief          That his heart trembles and his sight grows dim.    _This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first, I call and ask  these ladies whether they come from her, telling them that I think they  do, because they return the nobler. In the second, I pray them to tell  me of her; and the second begins here, \"And if indeed.\"_      II.        Canst thou indeed be he that still would sing        Of our dear lady unto none but us?        For though thy voice confirms that it is thus,      Thy visage might another witness bring.      And wherefore is thy grief so sore a thing        That grieving thou mak'st others dolorous?        Hast thou too seen her weep, that thou from us      Canst not conceal thine inward sorrowing?      Nay, leave our woe to us: let us alone:        'Twere sin if one should strive to soothe our woe,          For in her weeping we have heard her speak:      Also her look's so full of her heart's moan        That they who should behold her, looking so,          Must fall aswoon, feeling all life grow weak.    _This sonnet has four parts, as the ladies in whose person I reply  had four forms of answer. And, because these are sufficiently shown  above, I stay not to explain the purport of the parts, and therefore I  only discriminate them. The second begins here, \"And wherefore is thy  grief;\" the third here, \"Nay, leave our woe;\" the fourth, \"Also her  look.\"_    A few days after this, my body became afflicted with a painful  infirmity, whereby I suffered bitter anguish for many days, which at  last brought me unto such weakness that I could no longer move. And I  remember that on the ninth day, being overcome with intolerable pain, a  thought came into my mind concerning my lady: but when it had a little  nourished this thought, my mind returned to its brooding over mine  enfeebled body. And then perceiving how frail a thing life is, even  though health keep with it, the matter seemed to me so pitiful that I  could not choose but weep; and weeping I said within myself: \"Certainly  it must some time come to pass that the very gentle Beatrice will die.\"  Then, feeling bewildered, I closed mine eyes; and my brain began to be  in travail as the brain of one frantic, and to have such imaginations  as here follow.    And at the first, it seemed to me that I saw certain faces of women  with their hair loosened, which called out to me, \"Thou shalt surely  die;\" after the which, other terrible and unknown appearances said  unto me, \"Thou art dead.\" At length, as my phantasy held on in its  wanderings, I came to be I knew not where, and to behold a throng of  dishevelled ladies wonderfully sad, who kept going hither and thither  weeping. Then the sun went out, so that the stars showed themselves,  and they were of such a colour that I knew they must be weeping:  and it seemed to me that the birds fell dead out of the sky, and  that there were great earthquakes. With that, while I wondered in  my trance, and was filled with a grievous fear, I conceived that a  certain friend came unto me and said: \"Hast thou not heard? She that  was thine excellent lady hath been taken out of life.\" Then I began to  weep very piteously; and not only in mine imagination, but with mine  eyes, which were wet with tears. And I seemed to look towards Heaven,  and to"]]]
