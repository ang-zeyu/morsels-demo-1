[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41958"],[0,"The Microscope (#8)"],[1," a convex eye-lens, and this is a  further defect of the compound microscope of two lenses. But the  field-glass, at the same time that it bends the rays and converges  them to foci at B' B' and R' R', also reverses the curvature of the  images as there shown, and gives them the form best adapted for  distinct vision by the eye-glass E E. The field-glass has at the same  time brought the blue and red images closer together, so that they are  adapted to pass uncolored through the eye-glass. To render this  important point more intelligible, let it be supposed that the  object-glass had not been over-corrected, that it had been perfectly  achromatic; the rays would then have become colored as soon as they  had passed the field-glass; the blue rays, to take the central pencil,  for example, would converge at _b_ and the red rays at _r_, which is  just the reverse of what the eye-lens requires; for as its blue focus  is also shorter than its red, it would demand rather that the blue  image should be at _r_ and the red at _b_. This effect we have shown  to be produced by the over-correction of the object-glass, which  protrudes the blue foci B B as much beyond the red foci R R as the sum  of the distances between the red and blue foci of the field-lens and  eye-lens; so that the separation B R is exactly taken up in passing  through those two lenses, and the whole of the colors coincide as to  focal distance as soon as the rays have passed the eye-lens. But while  they coincide as to distance, they differ in another respect; the blue  images are rendered smaller than the red by the superior refractive  power of the field-glass upon the blue rays. In tracing the pencil L,  for instance, it will be noticed that after passing the field-glass,  two sets of lines are drawn, one whole, and one dotted, the former  representing the red, and the latter the blue rays. This is the  accidental effect in the Huyghenean eye-piece pointed out by  Boscovich. This separation into colors at the field-glass is like the  over-correction of the object-glass; it leads to a subsequent complete  correction. For if the differently colored rays were kept together  till they reached the eye-glass, they would then become colored, and  present colored images to the eye; but fortunately, and most  beautifully, the separation effected by the field-glass causes the  blue rays to fall so much nearer the centre of the eye-glass, where,  owing to the spherical figure, the refractive power is less than at  the margin, that the spherical error of the eye-lens constitutes a  nearly perfect balance to the chromatic dispersion of the field-lens,  and the red and blue rays L' and L'' emerge sensibly parallel,  presenting, in consequence, the perfect definition of a single point  to the eye. The same reasoning is true of the intermediate colors and  of the other pencils.    From what has been stated it is obvious that we mean by an achromatic  object-glass one in which the usual order of dispersion is so far  reversed that the light, after undergoing the singularly beautiful  series of changes effected by the eye-piece, shall come uncolored to  the eye. We can give no specific rules for producing these results.  Close study of the formulae for achromatism given by the celebrated  mathematicians we have quoted will do much, but the principles must be  brought to the test of repeated experiment. Nor will the experiments  be worth anything, unless the curves be most accurately measured and  worked, and the lenses centered and adjusted with a degree of  precision which, to those who are familiar only with telescopes, will  be quite unprecedented.    The Huyghenean eye-piece which we have described is the best for  merely optical purposes, but when it is required to measure the  magnified image, we use the eye-piece invented by Mr. Ramsden, and  called, from its purpose, the micrometer eye-piece. When it is stated  that we sometimes require to measure portions of animal or vegetable  matter a hundred times smaller than any divisions that can be  artificially made on any measuring instrument, the advantage of  applying the scale to the magnified image will be obvious, as compared  with the application of engraved or mechanical micrometers to the  stage of the instrument.    The arrangement is shown in Fig. 21, where E E and F F are the eye and  field glass, the latter having now its plane face towards the object.  The rays from the object are here made to converge at A A, immediately  in front of the field-glass, and here also is placed a plane glass on  which are engraved divisions of a hundredth of an inch or less. The  markings of these divisions come into focus therefore at the same time  as the image of the object, and both are distinctly seen together.  Thus the measure of the magnified image is given by mere inspection,  and the value of such measures in reference to the real object may be  obtained thus, which, when once obtained, is constant for the same  object-glass. Place on the stage of the instrument a divided scale the  value of which is known, and viewing this scale as the microscopic  object, observe how many of the divisions on the scale attached to the  eye-piece correspond with one of those in the magnified image. If, for  instance, ten of those in the eye-piece correspond with one of those in  the image, and if the divisions are known to be equal, then the image  is ten times larger than the object, and the dimensions of the object  are ten times less than indicated by the micrometer. If the divisions  on the micrometer and on the magnified scale were not equal, it  becomes a mere rule-of-three sum, but in general this trouble is taken  by the maker of the instrument, who furnishes a table showing the  value of each division of the micrometer for every object-glass with  which it may be used.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.]    While on the subject of measuring it may be well to explain the mode  of ascertaining the magnifying power of the compound microscope, which  is generally taken on the assumption before mentioned, that the naked  eye sees most distinctly at the distance of ten inches.    Place on the stage of the instrument, as before, a known divided  scale, and when it is distinctly seen, hold a rule at ten inches  distance from the disengaged eye, so that it may be seen by that eye,  overlapping or lying by side of the magnified picture of the other  scale. Then move the rule till one or more of its known divisions  correspond with a number of those in the magnified scale, and a  comparison of the two gives the magnifying power.    Having now explained the optical principles of the achromatic compound  microscope, it remains only to describe the mechanical arrangements  for giving those principles their full effect. The mechanism of a  microscope is of much more importance than might be imagined by those  who have not studied the subject. In the first place, steadiness, or  freedom from vibration, and most particularly freedom from any  vibrations which are not equally communicated to the object under  examination, and to the lenses by which it is viewed, is a point of  the utmost consequence. When, for instance, the body containing the  lenses is screwed by its lower extremity to a horizontal arm, we have  one of the most vibratory forms conceivable; it is precisely the form  of the inverted pendulum, which is expressly contrived to indicate  otherwise insensible vibrations. The tremor necessarily attendant on  such an arrangement is magnified by the whole power of the instrument;  and as the object on the stage partakes of this tremor in a  comparatively insensible degree, the image is seen to oscillate so  rapidly, as in some cases to be wholly undistinguishable. Such  microscopes cannot possibly be used with high powers in ordinary  houses abutting on any paved streets through which carriages are  passing, nor indeed are they adapted to be used in houses in which the  ordinary internal sources of shaking exist.    One of the best modes of mounting a compound microscope is shown in  the annexed view (Fig. 22), which, though too minute to exhibit all  the details, will serve to explain the chief features of the  arrangement.    A massy pillar A is screwed into a solid tripod B, and is surmounted  by a strong joint at C, on which the whole instrument turns, so as to  enable it to take a perfectly horizontal or vertical position, or any  intermediate angle, such, for instance, as that shown in the  engraving.    This movable portion of the instrument consists of one solid casting D  E F G; from F to G being a thick pierced plate carrying the stage and  its appendages. The compound body H is attached to the bar D E, and  moves up and down upon it by a rack and pinion worked by either of the  milled heads K. The piece D E F G is attached to the pillar by the  joint C, which being the source of the required movement in the  instrument, is obviously its weakest part, and about which no doubt  considerable vibration takes place. But inasmuch as the piece D E F G  of necessity transmits such vibrations equally to the body of the  microscope and to the objects on the stage, they hold always the same  relative position, and no _visible_ vibration is caused, how much  soever may really exist. To the under side of the stage is attached a  circular stem L, on which slides the mirror M, plane on one side and  concave on the other, to reflect the light through the aperture in the  stage. Beneath the stage is a circular revolving plate containing  three apertures of various sizes, to limit the angle of the pencil of  light which shall be allowed to fall on the object under examination.  Besides these conveniences the stage has a double movement produced by  two racks at right angles to each other, and worked by milled heads  beneath. It has also the usual appendages of forceps to hold minute  objects, and a lens to condense the light upon them, all "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],[0,"The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#8)"],[1,"that I felt an acute pain in my head, as if my eyes were being torn out,  and I thought I heard footsteps of persons moving about me. At last I  shook off that infernal sleep; my senses recovered their activity, and I  only then felt a great weariness over my entire body, and an agonising  pain in my eyes. I raised my hand to them and found my face bathed with  a liquid, which I thought was sweat. A terrible suspicion seized on me  at that moment: I feared that they had deprived me for ever of the  light, and the pain which I felt in my eyes for some days confirmed that  idea. From that time forth I desired more ardently than ever to be able  to leave my prison, in order to find out if my suspicions were correct,  if I were condemned to live for ever in darkness; and I incessantly  demanded my liberty from my jailer, who at last, speaking to me for the  first time, informed me that I was about to receive my liberty. He then  took me by the hand, and guiding me through some winding passages, left  me in a place, which appeared to me to be a field, for the air was  circulating freely; the rustling of the leaves, moving over the ground,  could be heard; my feet trod on a soft substance, which I knew to be  grass; and the murmurings of the fountains and brooks arrived to my  ears. Then--ay, then! a despairing cry escaped my lips; there was no  longer any doubt, the Count of Carrion had condemned me to perpetual  darkness; the sun, the sky, the verdure of the fields, and above all,  the dangerous beauty with which God had endowed my daughter--my beloved  Sancha--could never again be seen by me! \"But what has become of her, my  God!\" I exclaimed. \"Where shall I find her? Where is she, that she does  not come to guide her poor blind father in the darkness which will  perpetually surround him?\" And from that time to this I seek my daughter  everywhere, in the villages and in the cities, in palaces and in  cabins--and nowhere can I find her. A hundred times have I gone to Don  Suero to demand of him where she is, and he has always ordered his  servants to drive me with blows from his palace, and now I fear to go  near him again, for he would kill me, and I do not wish to die until I  have clasped my daughter in my arms, and found a cavalier who will  avenge the terrible injuries which have been inflicted on us.'\"    \"God's anger! what a wretch that count is!\" exclaimed Rodrigo, when the  girl had related thus far, and to whom he had listened with visible  emotion. \"I would give my life,\" he continued, \"to prove against him the  temper of my sword; and I pray God to grant me an opportunity of doing  so.\"    \"In such a way did Martin cry out,\" continued the maiden, \"when the  blind man terminated his sad history. You could have seen him, sir  knight, clenching his strong hands, brandishing the stout stick which he  used as a staff, and following with his eyes the road on which, but a  few minutes before, the count had disappeared, as if seeking that  infamous cavalier, in order to crush him with his righteous anger.\"    \"I vow by Judas Iscariot,\" exclaimed Fernan, not less indignant than his  master, \"that if I can get my lance near that villainous wretch, I will  spit him on it like a hen, not alone in the presence of the King of Leon  and Castile, but even in that of the King of Heaven Himself. But  continue your narrative, fair maid, for both my master and I are most  anxious to hear the conclusion of your own adventure.\"    The maiden then returned to what concerned herself, and the knight and  the squire approached their steeds as near hers as they possibly could,  so as not to miss a word of what she might say.    \"The sun was about to hide himself behind a distant hill; and the birds  were bidding him farewell, singing plaintively in the trees which  surrounded us; and the pilgrims were beginning to leave the sanctuary,  as their songs and their joyous cries could be heard on the various  roads which branched off in all directions. We took the one which led to  Carrion, and the blind man with the lute was to get a night's lodging in  the hermitage. His story had taken gladness from our hearts, and we were  walking on, silent and uneasy, as if we foresaw some misfortune. Night  had come on, and the moon was alternately lighting up the landscape and  hiding herself behind the large black clouds which were moving across  the sky. On entering a narrow road, bordered by thick trees, we  perceived, in the obscurity, some dark objects which appeared to us to  be men on horseback, and we were not wrong, for just then they advanced  to meet us, calling out to us, 'Halt, ye rustics, or whoever ye are.'  Martin recognised the voice as that of one of the servants of Don Suero,  and told me so, placing himself before me, as if to protect me from a  danger which he believed was threatening me. Two of the horsemen  dismounted and came towards me with drawn swords; the moon then  concealed herself behind a dark cloud, and a terrific fight took place  between the ruffians and Martin, whose father, together with my father,  ran to his aid, although they were armed even worse than he was. At  last, however, the combat ceased; but the darkness prevented me from  seeing what had happened to Martin and our fathers. One of the ruffians  then lifted me up in his strong arms, without my being able to resist  him, as terror had deprived me of all strength, and placed me in those  of one of the men who had not dismounted; he then, placing me before him  on the horse, gave it the spurs and galloped off, followed by his  comrades, not, as I judged, by the road towards Carrion, but to a castle  situated at the boundaries of the district.    \"He who had carried me off was Don Suero, whom I afterwards saw lying  insensible before the Inn of the Moor. An hour before your arrival we  all dismounted at that hostelry, for the ride had been rapid and long,  and both riders and horses were almost exhausted by hunger and fatigue.  However, when they were about to resume their journey, the footsteps of  your steeds were heard, and Don Suero, shutting me up in a room, sallied  forth with his followers to meet you. You know now, sir knight, how  grateful I should be for the service you have rendered me; but, even if  saved from my abductor, I cannot but weep for my father and for the  brave youth to whom I was to have been married, and of whose fate I am  ignorant, as they are of mine.\"    Thus speaking, the girl gave vent to her tears, which even the kind  words of Rodrigo and his squire were unavailing to restrain.    Not long after this the battlements of the Castle of Vivar were seen in  the distance, and when the sun had about half finished his daily journey  our travellers arrived at the end of theirs.          CHAPTER V    HOW RODRIGO AND HIS SQUIRE WERE RECEIVED AT VIVAR      The first care of Rodrigo on entering his paternal mansion was to  entrust the young girl to the care of his mother's servant-women, and  they, knowing how necessary rest was for her, prepared a comfortable  bed, in which we shall leave her to her repose, in order to describe the  reception which his mother gave to the newly-made knight, and which his  sweetheart gave to Fernan.    Rodrigo had now been separated from his mother for many months. Being  ignorant of the customs of the Court--as he had scarcely ever been  absent from Vivar, except when visiting the estates of Don Gome or  attending some tournament in the vicinity--his father brought him to it,  in order that he might become acquainted with its usages and learn all  that a young man, who would soon, most likely, be made a knight, should  know.    Teresa Nu[~n]a was a lady in whom were to be found all the virtues and good  qualities that one could desire in a woman. The nobility of her race,  and her prudence and beauty gave her a right to shine in the royal  Court, but her ambition from the time she was a child was of a different  kind. All the glory and all the delights of the world were, for her,  only to be found at the domestic hearth; to love her family, to be loved  in return, and to be the guardian angel of the weak and of the  poor--these were the objects of her ambition, these were her greatest  delights, these were her supreme desires. At the time when she was born  it was usual for girls who, like Teresa, looked with disdain on worldly  riches and the pleasures of love, to bury themselves in a cloister;  nevertheless, although her faith was as pure and as holy as that which,  five centuries later, inflamed the soul of another Teresa, the singer of  divine love,--even though she may not have participated in the same  religious ecstasies as that saint,--Teresa Nu[~n]a entertained different  views. She considered that the cloister should be the asylum of the  unfortunate, a refuge for hearts which looked for nothing but heaven,  the dwelling of those who could do but little for the cause of humanity.  To make the happiness of an honoured husband, to give to her country  sons who might be an honour to it and defend it, to cover with the  mantle of charity and mercy the nakedness and the misery of the  unfortunate--these things were in her mind the holiest duties of a  woman. For something more than singing to heaven the psalms of the  poet-king, through the bars placed across the window of a cell, did God  place the woman by the side of the man,--woman, that weak, beautiful,  sweet, persuasive being, full of charity, all spirit, all poetry. God,  who causes sweet-smelling flowers to spring up in the midst of the foul  marshes, and the herbs to grow on the hard rock, in order that the odour  of their flowers may neutralise the fetid smell of the marsh, and the  soft leaves the asperity of the stone; God, we repeat, has placed the  woman at the side of the man in order that the sweetness of the one  nature may neutralise the asperity of the other.
