The two populations were  distinguished on the basis of color pattern and the size of the  tympanum. Measurements of 17 males of _S. p. nebulosus_ from central  Chiapas and 18 males of _S. p. pipilans_ from southcentral Oaxaca and  Guerrero, Mexico, demonstrates that the supposed difference in tympanum  size is not significant (Fig. 15). There is, however, a tendency for  the western population of _S. pipilans_ to have larger tympani. Based on  the present examination of 112 specimens of this species the two  populations are held to be sufficiently distinct to warrant taxonomic  recognition as subspecies (Fig. 16).

[Illustration: FIG. 17: Distribution of _Syrrhophus pipilans_:         _nebulosus_ (open circles) and _pipilans_ (solid circles).]    Gadow's (1905) record of _S. verruculatus_ from \"Buena Vista, S.  Guerrero\" is most likely applicable to this species. Gadow simply  included the name in a list of the species he had collected during his  trip in Mexico (1902-04); no further comment was made on this species  although references to _Syrrhopus_ (sic) appear in several places in the  paper and would appear to apply to the species he had.    _Etymology._--Latin, _pipilo_, chirping, peeping, in reference to the  call of the male.    _Distribution._--Sea level to about 1800 meters along the Pacific  versant of western Mexico from central Guerrero to the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec (Fig. 17).    _Specimens examined._--(62).

The type series was  collected beneath rocks in a stream bed; the collectors heard calling  frogs in the bushes but were unable to obtain specimens (Langebartel and  Shannon, 1956).

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],[0,"The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#8)"],[1,"V), and  learning there of the great and awful things of the ocean world, I  desired to make a voyage to unknown seas, and to see with my own eyes  some of the wonderful things of which I had heard.    \"I heard that there was in the city of Seville an armada (armade) of  five ships, which were ready to perform a long voyage in order to find  the shortest way to the Islands of Moluco (Molucca) from whence came the  spices. The Captain General of this armada was Ferdinand de Magagleanes  (Magellan), a Portuguese gentleman, who had made several voyages on the  ocean. He was an honorable man. So I set out from Barcelona, where the  Emperor was, and traveled by land to the said city of Seville, and  secured a place in the expedition.    \"The Captain General published ordinances for the guidance of the  voyage.    \"He willed that the vessel on which he himself was should go before the  other vessels, and that the others should keep in sight of it. Therefore  he hung by night over the deck a torch or faggot of burning wood which  he called a farol (lantern), which burned all night, so that the ships  might not lose sight of his own.    \"He arranged to set other lights as signals in the night. When he wished  to make a tack on account of a change of weather he set two lights.  Three lights signified \"faster.\" Four lights signified to stop and turn.  When he discovered a rock or land, it was to be signalled by other  lights.    \"He ordered that three watches should be kept at night.    \"On Monday, St. Lawrence Day, August 10th, the five ships with the crews  to the number of two hundred and thirty-seven[A] set sail from the noble  city of Seville, amid the firing of artillery and came to the end of the  river Guadalcavir (Guadalquivir). We stopped near the Cape St. Vinconet  to make further provisions for the voyage.        [A] The number was larger, about 270.    \"We went to hear mass on shore. There the Captain commanded that all the  men should confess before going any further.    \"On Tuesday, September 20th, we set sail from St. Lucar.    \"We came to Canaria (Canaries).\"    This account repeats in a different way a part of the facts we have  given.    Here the young Italian relates his first story, which is substantially  as follows:      THE FOUNTAIN TREE.    \"Among the isles of the Canaria there is one which is very wonderful.  There is not to be found a single drop of water which flows from any  fountain or river.    \"But in this rainless land at the hour of midday, every day, there  descends a cloud from the sky which envelops a large tree which grows on  this island.    \"The cloud falls upon the leaves of the tree, when a great abundance of  water distills from the leaves. The tree flows, and soon at the foot of  it there gathers a fountain.    \"The people of the island come to drink of the water. The animals and  the birds refresh themselves there.\"    The story is true so far as relates to the fountain tree. But that a  cloud comes down from Heaven at midday to refresh it, is not an exact  statement of the manner in which this tree furnishes water to the  sterile island. The young Italian writer describes the tree as he saw  it, and as it seemed to be. The tree that supplies water as from a  natural fountain may still be found.    With such a tree to begin his researches on the sea, Pigafetta must have  been impatient to proceed along the marvelous ocean way. All the world  was to him as he saw it; he seldom stopped to inquire if appearances  were true.    With men like Del Cano on board, who had ears for a marvelous story, his  life in the early part of the voyage must have been a very happy one.  Wonder followed wonder....    \"Monday, the 3d of October,\" says the interesting Italian, \"we set sail  making the course auster, which the Levantine mariners call siroc  (southeast) entering into the ocean sea. We passed Cape Verde and  navigated by the coast of Guinea of Ethiopia, where there is a mountain  called Sierra Leona. A rain fell, and the storm lasted sixty days.\"    They came to waters full of sharks, which had terrible teeth, and which  ate all the people whom they found in the sea, alive or dead. These were  caught by a hook of iron.      ST. ELMO'S FIRE.    Here good St. Anseline met the ships; in the fancy of the mariners of  the time, this airy saint appeared to favored ships in the night, and  fair weather always followed the saintly apparition. He came in a robe  of fire, and stood and shone on the top of the high masts or on the  spars. The sailors hailed him with joy, as one sent from Heaven. Happy  was the ship on the tropic sea upon whose rigging the form of good St.  Anseline appeared in the night, and especially in the night of cloud  and storm!    To the joy of all the ships good St. Anseline came down one night to the  fleet of Magellan. The poetical Italian tells the story in this way:    \"During these storms, the body of St. Anseline appeared to us several  times.    \"One night among others he came when it was very dark on account of bad  weather. He came in the form of a fire lighted at the summit of the main  mast, and remained there near two hours and a half.    \"This comforted us greatly, for we were in tears, looking for the hour  when we should perish.    \"When the holy light was going away from us it shed forth so great a  brilliancy in our eyes that we were like people blinded for near a  quarter of an hour. We called out for mercy.    \"Nobody expected to escape from the storm.    \"It is to be noted that all and as many times as the light which  represents St. Anseline shows itself upon a vessel which is in a storm  at sea, that vessel never is lost.    \"As soon as this light had departed the sea grew calmer and the wings of  divers kinds of birds appeared.\"    Beneficent St. Anseline who manifested his presence by illuminations in  the mast and spars in equatorial waters! The beautiful illusion has long  been explained and dispelled. It is but an electric fire at the end of  atmospheric disturbances. But it is usually a correct prophecy of fair  skies and smooth seas. It is now called St. Elmo's Fire.    If ever there was an expedition that the saint of the mariners might  favor it would seem to be this.    One can almost envy the pious Italian his imagination in the clearing  tropic night.    His next wonders were the sea birds, of which there were flocks and  clouds, and with them appeared flying fish.    The ships were now off the coasts of Brazil and stopped at Verzim.    The people of the Brazilian Verzim were accustomed to paint themselves  \"by fire.\" We do not clearly understand how this painting \"by fire\" was  done. The art of scorching has perished with them. But besides these  indelible marks, the men had three holes in their lower lips, and hung  in them, after the manner of earrings, small round ornamental stones,  about a finger in length. The men did not shave, for they _plucked out_  their beard.    Their only clothing was a circle of parrot feathers. How _terribly_ gay  they must have looked! And yet such customs were hardly more ridiculous  than those of later times, and more civilized countries--earrings,  beauty patches, plume, and snuffboxes.    It was the land of parrots. The most beautiful and intelligent parrots  still come from Brazil. Columbus saw parrots in \"clouds\" over the  islands of the Antilles.    Parrots were not expensive in these equatorial forests at this time.  \"The natives,\" says Pigafetta, \"give eight or ten parrots for a looking  glass,\" and as a looking glass would multiply the picture of parrots  indefinitely the Verzimans must have thought the exchange a marvelous  bargain.    If Brazilian parrots were cheap and so charming as likely to become an  embarrassment of riches, so were the little cat monkeys which delighted  the men. These little creatures, which looked like miniature lions,  still delight the visitors to the coast of Brazil, but they shiver up  when brought to the northern atmospheres and piteously cry for the home  lands of the sun again.    Very curious birds began to excite the surprise of the voyagers, among  such as had a \"beak like a spoon,\" and \"no tongue.\"    The markets of the new land displayed another commodity far more  surprising than birds or animals, young slaves, which were offered for  sale by their own families. So a family who had many children was rich.  It cost a hatchet to buy one of these, and for a hatchet and a knife one  might buy _two_.    The people made bread of the \"marrow of trees,\" and carried victuals in  baskets on their heads.    Masses were said for the crews on shore, and the natives knelt down with  the men.    The people were so pleased with their visitors that they built a common  house for them.    A pleasing illusion had made the sailors most welcome here.    It had not rained in Verzim for two months when the expedition landed.  The people were looking to the heavens for mercy day by day. But the  copper sun rose as often in a clear sky.    At last Magellan's sails appeared in the burning air. The sight of the  sails was followed by that of clouds.    The people thought that the fleet had brought the clouds with them.    \"They come from Heaven,\" said they of the adventurers.    So when they were exhorted to accept Christianity, they at once fell  down before the uplifted crosses and believed the teachings of the sea  heroes who could command the clouds and bring rain to the parched land.    They thought the ships were gods and the small boats the children of  such beings, and when the latter approached the ships they imagined that  they were children come home to their fathers or mothers.    The ships remained in this delightful country of Verzim thirteen weeks.  Pigafetta and Del Cano must have thought that life here was ideal. What  scenes would follow?          CHAPTER IX.
