A hundred new faces will soon  help you to forget mine, for long as you have lived on the Nile, you are  still a Greek from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, and  may thank the gods that you have remained so. I am a great friend of  constancy too, but quite as great an enemy of folly, and is there  one among you who would not call it folly to fret over what cannot be  undone? I cannot call the Egyptian constancy a virtue, it is a delusion.  The men who treasure their dead for thousands of years, and would rather  lose their last loaf than allow a single bone belonging to one of their  ancestors to be taken from them, are not constant, they are foolish. Can  it possibly make me happy to see my friends sad? Certainly not! You must  not imitate the Egyptians, who, when they lose a friend, spend months  in daily-repeated lamentations over him. On the contrary, if you will  sometimes think of the distant, I ought to say, of the departed, friend,  (for as long as I live I shall never be permitted to tread Egyptian  ground again), let it be with smiling faces; do not cry, 'Ah! why was  Phanes forced to leave us?' but rather, 'Let us be merry, as Phanes used  to be when he made one of our circle!' In this way you must celebrate my  departure, as Simonides enjoined when he sang:           \"If we would only be more truly wise,          We should not waste on death our tears and sighs,          Nor stand and mourn o'er cold and lifeless clay          More than one day.            For Death, alas! we have no lack of time;          But Life is gone, when scarcely at its prime,          And is e'en, when not overfill'd with care          But short and bare!\"    \"If we are not to weep for the dead, how much less ought we to grieve  for absent friends! the former have left us for ever, but to the latter  we say at parting, 'Farewell, until we meet again'\"    Here the Sybarite, who had been gradually becoming more and more  impatient, could not keep silent any longer, and called out in the most  woe begone tone: \"Will you never begin your story, you malicious fellow?  I cannot drink a single drop till you leave off talking about death. I  feel cold already, and I am always ill, if I only think of, nay, if I  only hear the subject mentioned, that this life cannot last forever.\"  The whole company burst into a laugh, and Phanes began to tell his  story:    \"You know that at Sais I always live in the new palace; but at Memphis,  as commander of the Greek body-guard which must accompany the king  everywhere, a lodging was assigned me in the left wing of the old  palace.    \"Since Psamtik the First, Sais has always been the royal residence,  and the other palaces have in consequence become somewhat neglected. My  dwelling was really splendidly situated, and beautifully furnished; it  would have been first-rate, if, from the first moment of my entrance, a  fearful annoyance had not made its appearance.    \"In the day-time, when I was seldom at home, my rooms were all that  could be wished, but at night it was impossible to sleep for the  tremendous noise made by thousands of rats and mice under the old  floors, and couches, and behind the hangings.    \"Even in the first night an impudent mouse ran over my face.    \"I was quite at a loss what to do, till an Egyptian soldier sold me two  large cats, and these, in the course of many weeks, procured me some  rest from my tormentors.    \"Now, you are probably all aware that one of the charming laws of this  most eccentric nation, (whose culture and wisdom, you, my Milesian  friends, cannot sufficiently praise), declares the cat to be a sacred  animal. Divine honors are paid to these fortunate quadrupeds as well as  to many other animals, and he who kills a cat is punished with the same  severity as the murderer of a human being.\"    Till now Rhodopis had been smiling, but when she perceived that Phanes'  banishment had to do with his contempt for the sacred animals, her face  became more serious. She knew how many victims, how many human lives,  had already been sacrificed to this Egyptian superstition, and how, only  a short time before, the king Amasis himself had endeavored in vain to  rescue an unfortunate Samian, who had killed a cat, from the vengeance  of the enraged populace.       [The cat was probably the most sacred of all the animals worshipped     by the Egyptians. Herod tells that when a house was on fire the     Egyptians never thought of extinguishing the fire until their cats     were all saved, and that when a cat died, they shaved their heads in     sign of mourning. Whoever killed one of these animals, whether     intentionally or by accident, suffered the penalty, of death,     without any chance of mercy. Diod. (I. 81.) himself witnessed the     murder of a Roman citizen who had killed a cat, by the Egyptian     people; and this in spite of the authorities, who in fear of the     powerful Romans, endeavored to prevent the deed. The bodies of the     cats were carefully embalmed and buried, and their mummies are to be     found in every museum. The embalmed cat, carefully wrapped in linen     bandages, is oftener to be met with than any other of the many     animals thus preserved by the Egyptians. In spite of the great care     bestowed on cats, there can have been no lack of mice in Egypt. In     one nomos or province the shrew-mouse was sacred, and a satirical,     obscene papyrus in Turin shows us a war between the cats and mice;     the Papyrus Ebers contains poisons for mice. We ourselves possess a     shrew-mouse exquisitely wrought in bronze.]    \"Everything was going well,\" continued the officer, \"when we left  Memphis two years ago.    \"I confided my pair of cats to the care of one of the Egyptian servants  at the palace, feeling sure that these enemies of the rats would keep  my dwelling clear for the future; indeed I began to feel a certain  veneration for my deliverers from the plague of mice.    \"Last year Amasis fell ill before the court could adjourn to Memphis,  and we remained at Sais.    \"At last, about six week ago, we set out for the city of the Pyramids. I  betook me to my old quarters; not the shadow of a mouse's tail was to be  seen there, but instead, they swarmed with another race of animals not  one whit dearer to me than their predecessors. The pair of cats had,  during my two years' absence, increased twelve-fold. I tried all in my  power to dislodge this burdensome brood of all ages and colors, but  in vain; every night my sleep was disturbed by horrible choruses of  four-footed animals, and feline war-cries and songs.    \"Every year, at the period of the Bubastis festival, all superfluous  cats may be brought to the temple of the cat-headed goddess Pacht, where  they are fed and cared for, or, as I believe, when they multiply too  fast, quietly put out of the way. These priests are knaves!    \"Unfortunately the journey to the said temple\" did not occur during the  time of our stay in Memphis; however, as I really could not tolerate  this army of tormentors any longer, I determined at least to get rid  of two families of healthy kittens with which their mothers had just  presented me. My old slave Mus, from his very name a natural enemy of  cats, was told to kill the little creatures, put them into a sack, and  throw them into the Nile.    \"This murder was necessary, as the mewing of the kittens would otherwise  have betrayed the contents of the sack to the palace-warders. In the  twilight poor Muss betook himself to the Nile through the grove of  Hathor, with his perilous burden. But alas! the Egyptian attendant who  was in the habit of feeding my cats, had noticed that two families of  kittens were missing, and had seen through our whole plan.    \"My slave took his way composedly through the great avenue of Sphinxes,  and by the temple of Ptah, holding the little bag concealed under  his mantle. Already in the sacred grove he noticed that he was being  followed, but on seeing that the men behind him stopped before the  temple of Ptah and entered into conversation with the priests, he felt  perfectly reassured and went on.    \"He had already reached the bank of the Nile, when he heard voices  calling him and a number of people running towards him in haste; at the  same moment a stone whistled close by his head.    \"Mus at once perceived the danger which was threatening him. Summoning  all his strength he rushed down to the Nile, flung the bag in, and then  with a beating heart, but as he imagined without the slightest evidence  of guilt, remained standing on the shore. A few moments later he was  surrounded by at least a hundred priests.    \"Even the high-priest of Ptah, my old enemy Ptahotep, had not disdained  to follow the pursuers in person.    \"Many of the latter, and amongst them the perfidious palace-servant,  rushed at once into the Nile, and there, to our confusion, found the  bag with its twelve little corpses, hanging entirely uninjured among the  Papyrus-reeds and bean-tendrils. The cotton coffin was opened before  the eyes of the high-priest, a troop of lower priests, and at least a  thousand of the inhabitants of Memphis, who had hurried to the spot,  and when the miserable contents were disclosed, there arose such fearful  howls of anguish, and such horrible cries of mingled lamentation and  revenge, that I heard them even in the palace.    \"The furious multitude, in their wild rage, fell on my poor servant,  threw him down, trampled on him and would have killed him, had not  the all-powerful high-priest-designing to involve me, as author of the  crime, in the same ruin--commanded them to cease and take the wretched  malefactor to prison."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/548"],[0,"Project Trinity, 1945-1946 (#8)"],[1,"ages.    13.
