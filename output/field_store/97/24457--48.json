Without his  aid I could assuredly have made no way through the soldiers who  barred our retreat; and truly his sword did more execution than  mine, although I fought my best. If you will accept my friendship,  young sir, henceforth we will be brothers in arms.\" Colouring with  pleasure, Archie grasped the hand which the young knight held out  to him.    \"That is well said, Sir John,\" Wallace assented. \"Hitherto you and  I have been like brothers; henceforth there will be three of us,  and I foresee that the only difficulty we shall have with this  our youngest relation will be to curb his courage and ardour. Who  knows,\" he went on sadly, \"but that save you two I am now alone in  the world! My heart misgives me sorely as to the fate of Marion; and  were it not for the sake of Scotland, to whom my life is sworn, I  would that I had stopped and died outside her door before I entered  and brought danger upon her head. Had I had time to reflect, methinks  I would have done so; but I heard her call, I saw the open door,  and without time for thought or reflection I leapt in.\"    \"You must not blame yourself, Sir William,\" Grahame said, \"for,  indeed, there was no time for thought; nor will I that it should  have been otherwise, even should harm, which I cannot believe,  befall Mistress Marion.  It is on you that the hopes of Scotland  now rest. You have awakened her spirit and taught the lesson of  resistance. Soon I hope that the fire now smouldering in the breast  of every true Scotsman will burst into flame, and that Scotland  will make a great effort for freedom; but were you to fall now,  despair would seize on all and all hope of a general rising be at  an end.\"    Wallace made no reply, but strode silently forward. A short distance  farther they came to the spot where three of Wallace's followers  were holding horses, for he had on his entry into Lanark, been  accompanied by another of his party, who had been slain at the  commencement of the fray. Wallace bade Archie mount the spare horse,  and they then rode to Cart Lane Craigs, scarce a word being spoken  on their journey.    Wallace's headquarters were upon a narrow shelf of rock on the face  of a steep and craggy hill. It was well chosen against surprise,  and could be held against sudden attack even by a large force,  since both behind and in front the face of the hill was too steep  to be climbed, and the only approach was by a steep and winding  path which two men could hold against a host. The ledge was some  50 feet long by 12 wide.  At the back a natural depression in the  crags had been deepened so as to form a shallow cave just deep  enough to afford a defense against the weather; here a pile of  heather served as a bed for Wallace, Grahame, and one or two others  of the leaders of his company, and here Wallace told Archie that  his place was to be. On the ledge without were some low arbours of  heather in which lay ten of Wallace's bravest companions; the rest  of his band were scattered among the surrounding hills, or in the  woods, and a bugle note repeated from place to place would call  all together in a short space of time.    Of stores and provisions there was no lack, these having been  obtained in very large quantities from the convoys of supplies and  the castles that had been captured. Money, too, was not wanting,  considerable amounts having fallen into their hands, and the  peasantry through all the country round were glad in every way to  assist the band, whom they regarded as their champions.    Archie sat down by Sir John Grahame, who gave him particulars  regarding the strength of the various bands, their position, the  rules which had been laid down by Wallace for their order, the system  of signals and other particulars; while Wallace paced restlessly up  and down the narrow shelf, a prey to the keenest anxiety. Towards  nightfall two of the men were despatched towards Lanark to endeavour  to find out what had taken place there; but in an hour they returned  with a woman, whom both Sir William and Archie recognized as one of  the female attendants of Marion. A single glance sufficed to tell  her tale. Her face was swollen with crying, and wore a look of  horror as well as of grief.    \"She is dead!\" Wallace exclaimed in a low voice.    \"Alas!\" the woman sobbed, \"that I should have to tell it.  Yes, my  dear mistress is dead; she was slain by the orders of the governor  himself, for having aided your escape.\"    A groan burst from Wallace, a cry of horror and indignation from  his followers. The former turned, and without a word strode away  and threw himself upon the heather. The others, heart struck at  the cruel blow which had befallen their chief, and burning with  indignation and rage, could only utter oaths of vengeance and curses  on the English tyrants.    After a time Grahame went to the cave, and putting his hand on  Wallace's shoulder strove to address a few words of consolation to  him.    Sir William rose: \"I have done with weeping, Grahame, or rather I  will put off my weeping until I have time for it.  The first thing  to think of is vengeance, and vengeance I swear that I will have.  This night I will strike the first blow in earnest towards freeing  Scotland. It may be that God has willed it that this cruel blow,  which has been struck at me, shall be the means of bringing this  about. Hitherto, although I have hated the English and have fought  against them, it has been but fitfully and without order or method,  seeing that other things were in my heart. Henceforth I will live  but for vengeance and Scotland. Hitherto the English have regarded  me as an outlaw and a brigand. Henceforth they shall view me as an  enemy to be dreaded. Sound the signal of assembly at once. Signify  that as many as are within reach shall gather below in two hours.  There will be but few, for, not dreaming of this, the bands but  two days since dispersed. But even were there none but ourselves  it would suffice. Tonight we will take Lanark.\"          Chapter IV    The Capture of Lanark      A low shout of enthusiasm rose from Wallace's followers, and they  repeated his words as though it had been a vow: \"Tonight we will  take Lanark.\" The notes of a bugle rang through the air, and Archie  could hear them repeated as by an echo by others far away in the  woods.    The next two hours were spent in cooking and eating a meal; then  the party on the ledge descended the narrow path, several of their  number bearing torches. At a short distance from its foot some other  torches were seen, and fifteen men were found gathered together.    In a few words the sad news of what had taken place at Lanark was  related to them and the determination which had been arrived at,  and then the whole party marched away to the west. Archie's heart  beat with excitement as he felt himself engaged in one of the adventures  which had so filled his thoughts and excited his admiration. An  adventure, too, far surpassing in magnitude and importance any in  which Wallace had hitherto been engaged.    It seemed almost like an act of madness for twenty-five men to  attack a city garrisoned by over 500 English troops, defended by  strong walls; but Archie never doubted for a moment that success  would attend the enterprise, so implicit was his confidence in his  leader. When at some little distance from the town they halted,  and Wallace ordered a tree to be felled and lopped of its branches.  It was some eight inches in diameter at the butt and thirty feet  long. A rope had been brought, and this was now cut into lengths  of some four feet. Wallace placed ten of his men on each side of  the tree, and the cords being placed under it, it was lifted and  carried along with them.    Before they started Wallace briefly gave them his orders, so that  no word need be spoken when near the town.  The band were, when  they entered, to divide in three. Sir John Grahame, with a party,  was to make for the dwelling of Sir Robert Thorne. Auchinleck, who  had arrived with the party summoned by the bugle, was to arouse  the town and attack any parties of soldiers in the street, while  Wallace himself was to assault the house of Hazelrig. He bade Archie  accompany him.    Knowing the town well Wallace led the party to the moat at a spot  facing a sally port. They moved without a word being spoken. The  men bearing the tree laid it noiselessly to the ground. Wallace  himself sprang into the moat and swam across. The splash in the  water attracted the attention of a sentry over the gate, who at  once challenged. There was no answer, and the man again shouted,  peering over the wall to endeavour to discover what had caused  the splash. In a few vigorous strokes Wallace was across, hauled  himself up to the sill of the door, and with his heavy battleaxe  smote on the chains which held up the drawbridge. Two mighty blows  and the chains yielded, and the drawbridge fell with a crash across  the moat.    Instantly the men lifted the tree, and dashing across swung it  like a battering ram against the door--half a dozen blows, and  the oak and iron yielded before it. The door was burst in and the  party entered Lanark.  The sentry on the wall had fled at once to  arouse the garrison. Instantly the three leaders started to perform  the tasks assigned to them.  As yet the town lay in profound sleep,  although near the gate windows were opening and heads were being  put out to ascertain the cause of the din. As the Scots ran forward  they shouted \"Death to the English, death to the bloody Hazelrig!\"  The governor had long been odious for his cruelty and tyranny, and  the murder of Marion Bradfute had that day roused the indignation  of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48"],[0,"The 1992 CIA World Factbook (#8)"],[1,"locations operated by 14 national      governments party to the Treaty; one additional air facility operated by      commercial (nongovernmental) tourist organization; helicopter pads at 28 of      these locations; runways at 9 locations are gravel, sea ice, glacier ice, or      compacted snow surface suitable for wheeled fixed-wing aircraft; no paved      runways; 16 locations have snow-surface skiways limited to use by      ski-equipped planes - 9 runways/skiways 1,000 to 3,000 m, 4 runways/skiways      less than 1,000 m, 5 runways/skiways greater than 3,000 m, and 7 of      unspecified or variable length; airports generally subject to severe      restrictions and limitations resulting from extreme seasonal and geographic      conditions    :Antarctica Defense Forces    Note:      none; Article 7 of the Antarctic Treaty states that advance notice of all      military activities and the introduction of military personnel must be given    :Antigua and Barbuda Geography    Total area:      440 km2  Land area:      440 km2; includes Redonda  Comparative area:      slightly less than 2.5 times the size of Washington, DC  Land boundaries:      none  Coastline:      153 km  Maritime claims:    Contiguous zone:      24 nm    Exclusive economic zone:      200 nm    Territorial sea:      12 nm  Disputes:      none  Climate:      tropical marine; little seasonal temperature variation  Terrain:      mostly low-lying limestone and coral islands with some higher volcanic areas  Natural resources:      negligible; pleasant climate fosters tourism  Land use:      arable land 18%; permanent crops 0%; meadows and pastures 7%; forest and      woodland 16%; other 59%  Environment:      subject to hurricanes and tropical storms (July to October); insufficient      freshwater resources; deeply indented coastline provides many natural      harbors  Note:      420 km east-southeast of Puerto Rico    :Antigua and Barbuda People    Population:      64,110 (July 1992), growth rate 0.4% (1992)  Birth rate:      18 births/1,000 population (1992)  Death rate:      6 deaths/1,000 population (1992)  Net migration rate:      --8 migrants/1,000 population (1992)  Infant mortality rate:      20 deaths/1,000 live births (1992)  Life expectancy at birth:      71 years male, 75 years female (1992)  Total fertility rate:      1.7 children born/woman (1992)  Nationality:      noun - Antiguan(s), Barbudan(s); adjective - Antiguan, Barbudan  Ethnic divisions:      almost entirely of black African origin; some of British, Portuguese,      Lebanese, and Syrian origin  Religions:      Anglican (predominant), other Protestant sects, some Roman Catholic  Languages:      English (official), local dialects  Literacy:      89% (male 90%, female 88%) age 15 and over having completed 5 or more years      of schooling (1960)  Labor force:      30,000; commerce and services 82%, agriculture 11%, industry 7% (1983)  Organized labor:      Antigua and Barbuda Public Service Association (ABPSA), membership 500;      Antigua Trades and Labor Union (ATLU), 10,000 members; Antigua Workers Union      (AWU), 10,000 members (1986 est.)    :Antigua and Barbuda Government    Long-form name:      none  Type:      parliamentary democracy  Capital:      Saint John's  Administrative divisions:      6 parishes and 2 dependencies*; Barbuda*, Redonda*, Saint George, Saint      John, Saint Mary, Saint Paul, Saint Peter, Saint Philip  Independence:      1 November 1981 (from UK)  Constitution:      1 November 1981  Legal system:      based on English common law  National holiday:      Independence Day, 1 November (1981)  Executive branch:      British monarch, governor general, prime minister, Cabinet  Legislative branch:      bicameral Parliament consists of an upper house or Senate and a lower house      or House of Representatives  Judicial branch:      Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court  Leaders:    Chief of State:      Queen ELIZABETH II (since 6 February 1952), represented by Governor General      Sir Wilfred Ebenezer JACOBS (since 1 November 1981, previously Governor      since 1976)    Head of Government:      Prime Minister Vere Cornwall BIRD, Sr. (since NA 1976); Deputy Prime      Minister (vacant)  Political parties and leaders:      Antigua Labor Party (ALP), Vere C.

During the period 1987-90, real GDP      expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%. Tourism makes a direct      contribution to GDP of about 13% and also affects growth in other sectors -      particularly in construction, communications, and public utilities. Although      Antigua and Barbuda is one of the few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a      labor shortage in some sectors of the economy, it was hurt in 1991 by a      downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US recession.
