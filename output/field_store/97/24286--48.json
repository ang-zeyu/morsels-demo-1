In addition to the six planets shown in the figures the solar system  contains two large planets and several hundred small ones, for the most  part invisible to the naked eye, which are omitted in order to avoid  confusing the diagrams.    29. JUPITER AND SATURN.--In Fig. 16 the sun at the center is encircled  by the orbits of the three planets, and inclosing all of these is a  circular border showing the directions from the sun of the  constellations which lie along the zodiac. The student must note  carefully that it is only the directions of these constellations that  are correctly shown, and that in order to show them at all they have  been placed very much too close to the sun. The cross lines extending  from the orbit of the earth toward the sun with Roman numerals opposite  them show the positions of the earth in its orbit on the first day of  January (_I_), first day of February (_II_), etc., and the similar lines  attached to the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn with Arabic numerals show  the positions of those planets on the first day of January of each year  indicated, so that the figure serves to show not only the orbits of the  planets, but their actual positions in their orbits for something more  than the first decade of the twentieth century.    The line drawn from the sun toward the right of the figure shows the  direction to the vernal equinox. It forms one side of the angle which  measures a planet's longitude.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--The orbits of the inner planets.]    EXERCISE 14.--Measure with your protractor the longitude of the earth on  January 1st. Is this longitude the same in all years? Measure the  longitude of Jupiter on January 1, 1900; on July 1, 1900; on September  25, 1906.    Draw neatly on the map a pencil line connecting the position of the  earth for January 1, 1900, with the position of Jupiter for the same  date, and produce the line beyond Jupiter until it meets the circle of  the constellations. This line represents the direction of Jupiter from  the earth, and points toward the constellation in which the planet  appears at that date. But this representation of the place of Jupiter in  the sky is not a very accurate one, since on the scale of the diagram  the stars are in fact more than 100,000 times as far off as they are  shown in the figure, and the pencil mark does not meet the line of  constellations at the same intersection it would have if this line were  pushed back to its true position. To remedy this defect we must draw  another line from the sun parallel to the one first drawn, and its  intersection with the constellations will give very approximately the  true position of Jupiter in the sky.    EXERCISE 15.--Find the present positions of Jupiter and Saturn, and look  them up in the sky by means of your star maps. The planets will appear  in the indicated constellations as very bright stars not shown on the  map.    Which of the planets, Jupiter and Saturn, changes its direction from the  sun more rapidly? Which travels the greater number of miles per day?  When will Jupiter and Saturn be in the same constellation? Does the  earth move faster or slower than Jupiter?    The distance of Jupiter or Saturn from the earth at any time may be  readily obtained from the figure. Thus, by direct measurement with the  millimeter scale we find for January 1, 1900, the distance of Jupiter  from the earth is 6.1 times the distance of the sun from the earth, and  this may be turned into miles by multiplying it by 93,000,000, which is  approximately the distance of the sun from the earth. For most purposes  it is quite as well to dispense with this multiplication and call the  distance 6.1 astronomical units, remembering that the astronomical unit  is the distance of the sun from the earth.    EXERCISE 16.--What is Jupiter's distance from the earth at its nearest  approach? What is the greatest distance it ever attains? Is Jupiter's  least distance from the earth greater or less than its least distance  from Saturn?    On what day in the year 1906 will the earth be on line between Jupiter  and the sun? On this day Jupiter is said to be in _opposition_--i. e.,  the planet and the sun are on opposite sides of the earth, and Jupiter  then comes to the meridian of any and every place at midnight. When the  sun is between the earth and Jupiter (at what date in 1906?) the planet  is said to be in _conjunction_ with the sun, and of course passes the  meridian with the sun at noon. Can you determine from the figure the  time at which Jupiter comes to the meridian at other dates than  opposition and conjunction? Can you determine when it is visible in the  evening hours? Tell from the figure what constellation is on the  meridian at midnight on January 1st. Will it be the same constellation  in every year?      30. MERCURY, VENUS, AND MARS.--Fig. 17, which represents the orbits of  the inner planets, differs from Fig. 16 only in the method of fixing the  positions of the planets in their orbits at any given date. The motion  of these planets is so rapid, on account of their proximity to the sun,  that it would not do to mark their positions as was done for Jupiter and  Saturn, and with the exception of the earth they do not always return to  the same place on the same day in each year. It is therefore necessary  to adopt a slightly different method, as follows: The straight line  extending from the sun toward the vernal equinox, _V_, is called the  prime radius, and we know from past observations that the earth in its  motion around the sun crosses this line on September 23d in each year,  and to fix the earth's position for September 23d in the diagram we have  only to take the point at which the prime radius intersects the earth's  orbit. A month later, on October 23d, the earth will no longer be at  this point, but will have moved on along its orbit to the point marked  30 (thirty days after September 23d). Sixty days after September 23d it  will be at the point marked 60, etc., and for any date we have only to  find the number of days intervening between it and the preceding  September 23d, and this number will show at once the position of the  earth in its orbit. Thus for the date July 4, 1900, we find        1900, July 4 - 1899, September 23 = 284 days,    and the little circle marked upon the earth's orbit between the numbers  270 and 300 shows the position of the earth on that date.    In what constellation was the sun on July 4, 1900? What zodiacal  constellation came to the meridian at midnight on that date? What other  constellations came to the meridian at the same time?    The positions of the other planets in their orbits are found in the same  manner, save that they do not cross the prime radius on the same date in  each year, and the times at which they do cross it must be taken from  the following table:                          TABLE OF EPOCHS      -----------------------------------------------------------      A.

The following lines of the table show for  each year the date at which each planet first crossed the prime radius  in that year; the dates of subsequent crossings in any year can be found  by adding once, twice, or three times the period to the given date, and  the table may be extended to later years, if need be, by continuously  adding multiples of the period. In the case of Mars it appears that  there is only about one year out of two in which this planet crosses the  prime radius.    After the date at which the planet crosses the prime radius has been  determined its position for any required date is found exactly as in the  case of the earth, and the constellation in which the planet will appear  from the earth is found as explained above in connection with Jupiter  and Saturn.    The broken lines in the figure represent the construction for finding  the places in the sky occupied by Mercury, Venus, and Mars on July 4,  1900. Let the student make a similar construction and find the positions  of these planets at the present time. Look them up in the sky and see if  they are where your work puts them.    31. EXERCISES.--The \"evening star\" is a term loosely applied to any  planet which is visible in the western sky soon after sunset. It is easy  to see that such a planet must be farther toward the east in the sky  than is the sun, and in either Fig. 16 or Fig. 17 any planet which  viewed from the position of the earth lies to the left of the sun and  not more than 50Â° away from it will be an evening star. If to the right  of the sun it is a morning star, and may be seen in the eastern sky  shortly before sunrise.

While hunting in the coastal sagebrush belt I have  repeatedly seen frightened brush rabbits turn and dart beneath the  bushes a few feet from a human being rather than be driven into the  open.    A great horned owl shot in March, 1951, in the sage belt, had in its  stomach the remains of a freshly killed adult brush rabbit. Although  coyotes and brush rabbits often occur in the same general sections of  the sage flats, remains of these rabbits have been notably scarce in  coyote feces from these areas. This is probably because the coyote hunts  along clearings and in open brushland, precisely the type of habitat  avoided by brush rabbits.      Family SCIURIDAE      =Sciurus griseus anthonyi= Mearns    Western Gray Squirrel    Gray squirrels were on both slopes of the San Gabriels in oak woodland.  A gray squirrel was observed in April of 1948, as it climbed a telephone  pole adjacent to an orange grove near Cucamonga. This, and one noted  bounding up a slope of greasewood chaparral near Cattle Canyon, were the  only gray squirrels seen in areas which were not grown to oaks or  adjacent to oak woodland. In the lower foothills gray squirrels were  invariably found in association with valley oak, this plant forming  limited woodland areas in canyon bottoms. In the upper chaparral  association the squirrels frequented the large scrub oaks growing on  talus slopes and canyon sides. In the yellow pine woodland, gray  squirrels are restricted to black oaks, often where they formed mixed  stands with the conifers. On the interior slope these squirrels were  found only at the lower edge of the yellow pine woodland where black  oaks are common. There, in the vicinity of Big Pines, they were present  between roughly 5800 and 7000 feet, while on the Pacific slope they  inhabited oak woodland from 1600 feet to about 7000 feet elevation.    In Live Oak Canyon in December of 1950, tracks indicated that a bobcat  had killed a gray squirrel in a small draw beneath the oaks. In Evey  Canyon on March 6, 1951, while watching for bats at late twilight, I  observed a gray squirrel traveling through the branches of a nearby oak.  A great horned owl glided into the oak in an attempt to catch the  squirrel, which leaped quickly into a dense mass of foliage and escaped.  For roughly ten minutes the owl perched in the oak watching its intended  prey, then flew off down the canyon amid frantic scolding by the  squirrel.    On March 17, 1951, a female gray squirrel taken at about 3500 feet  elevation in San Antonio Canyon contained two embryos, each roughly 40  millimeters long.      =Spermophilus beecheyi beecheyi= (Richardson)    Beechey Ground Squirrel    From the coastal sage belt, into the yellow pine forest of the Pacific  slope, this species is common on land cleared by man or disturbed in the  course of construction, or on severely eroded slopes where the original  climax vegetation is partly or completely absent. Thus in the sage belt,  ground squirrels live along dirt roads through the brush, on the heavily  eroded banks often found in the foothills, on land grazed closely by  sheep, and in those parts of major washes such as San Antonio and  Cucamonga washes where scatterings of huge boulders offer prominent  vantage points. In San Antonio Canyon _Spermophilus_ was restricted to  the vicinity of roads and firebreaks, and an especially large colony of  at least forty individuals lived at a dump one mile southwest of Camp  Baldy at about 4500 feet elevation. Ground squirrels used burned stems  of large laurel sumac as observation posts. Because of a preference for  open areas offering unobstructed outlooks, ground squirrels originally  probably did not penetrate the main belt of heavy chaparral on the  Pacific slope of the range except in some of the large washes.    In the spring of 1951 and the preceding summer there was a marked  increase in the ground squirrel population near Padua Hills as a  result of sheep grazing on approximately one-half square mile of sage  land. Grasses and smaller shrubs were eaten down to the ground, and in  some places coastal sagebrush and _Haplopappus_ were killed by browsing  and trampling. The area formerly had a sparse growth of bushes with  intervening growths of tall grasses and one colony of perhaps 20 ground  squirrels; but after the sheep grazing the area was open brushland with  large clear spaces on which the herbage was trimmed to the ground, and  had at least four colonies of ground squirrels as large as the first.  Also there were other ground squirrels established in various parts of  the area. Probably the dry weather in the winter of 1950-51 with  consequent retardation of the vegetation aided the spread of the  squirrels in this area.    In the sage belt, most ground squirrels are dormant by December. In  1951, after a mild winter, squirrels were noted on January 25 near Padua  Hills. On February 8, 1951, males in breeding condition were collected,  and on March 16, a female taken near San Antonio Wash carried three  small embryos. In early March of 1951, ground squirrels were active at  4500 feet elevation in San Antonio Canyon.        _Specimen examined._--Los Angeles County: 1 mi. S and 2 mi. E      Big Pines, 8000 ft., 1.      =Spermophilus beecheyi fisheri= (Merriam)    California Ground Squirrel    This ground squirrel inhabited the desert slope of the mountains up to  5000 feet elevation, and was most common in the juniper belt; burrows  often were made under large junipers. In May, 1949, ground squirrels  were common in the rocks adjacent to Mescal Wash at an elevation of 4500  feet. In an apple orchard near Valyermo, squirrels fed on the fallen  fruit in early November of 1951.    No squirrel was seen in December, January, and February, indicating that  all were below ground in winter.        _Specimen examined._--San Bernardino County: Desert Springs,      4000 ft., 1 (PC).      =Ammospermophilus leucurus leucurus= (Merriam)    Antelope Ground Squirrel    Antelope ground squirrels were common in the Joshua tree woodland where  they were noted up to 4500 feet elevation in Graham Canyon. None was  found on the pinyon slopes, possibly because of the competition offered  there by _Eutamias merriami_, or because the rocky nature of the soil  there rendered burrowing difficult.    Although observed less often in winter than in summer, this species is  active all year. On February 6, 1949, in Mescal Wash, an antelope ground  squirrel was foraging over the snow which was at least six inches deep.  These squirrels were attracted to the carcasses of rodents used as bait  for carnivore sets, and caused a good deal of trouble by disturbing the  traps.    Antelope ground squirrels used the topmost twigs of box-thorn bushes  extensively as lookout posts, and many of their burrows were at the  bases of these thorny bushes. This habit of regularly using observation  posts is well developed in each species of ground squirrel found in the  San Gabriels.        _Specimens examined._--Los Angeles County: 6 mi. E and 1 mi. S      Llano, 3500 ft., 2.      =Eutamias speciosus speciosus= (Merriam)    Lodgepole Chipmunk    This chipmunk was characteristic of the most boreal parts of the San  Gabriel Mountains. It was recorded from 6800 feet elevation at Big  Pines, to an altitude of approximately 9800 feet near Mt. San Antonio,  and was common where coniferous timber was interspersed with snowbrush  chaparral. In upper Icehouse Canyon and near Telegraph Peak these  chipmunks were associated with lodgepole pines and chinquapin, and one  mile east of Mt. San Antonio individuals were often observed in thickets  of manzanita. This chipmunk usually shunned pure stands of coniferous  timber except as temporary forage ground.    On Blue Ridge these chipmunks used the uppermost stems of snowbrush as  vantage points, and when disturbed ran nimbly over thorny surfaces of  the brush in seeking refuge in the tangled growth.    In early November of 1951, these animals were not yet in hibernation on  Blue Ridge. They were noted on November 6, after the season's first  snows had melted; on November 13, however, a cold wind with drifting fog  kept most of them under cover, and only two were noted in the course of  the day.        _Specimen examined._--Los Angeles County: 1 mi. S and 2 mi. E      Big Pines, 8100 ft., 1.      =Eutamias merriami merriami= (J. A. Allen)    Merriam Chipmunk    The lower limit of the range of this species, on the coastal face of the  range, is roughly coincident with that of manzanita--that is to say, it  begins in the main belt of chaparral above the lower foothills. _E.  merriami_ seems to reach maximum abundance amid the granite talus, and  scrub oak and _Pseudotsuga_ growth at the upper edge of the chaparral  association. It was absent, however, from all but the lower fringe of  the yellow pine forest association.    On the desert slope _merriami_ was partial to rocky areas in the  pinyon-juniper association but was also in the black oak woods on the  Ball Flat fire road near Jackson Lake. Nowhere was _Eutamias merriami_  and _E. speciosus_ observed on common ground.        _Specimens examined._--Los Angeles County: San Antonio Canyon,      5500 ft., 2 (1 PC).      =Glaucomys sabrinus californicus= (Rhoads)    Northern Flying Squirrel    No specimens of this species were taken in the field work in the San  Gabriels, nor did I find any rangers or residents of the mountains who  had seen flying squirrels in the area. Nevertheless sign found in the  white fir forests in the Big Pines area indicated that flying squirrels  may occur there. On a number of occasions dissected pine cones were  noted on the horizontal limbs and bent trunks of white firs. These cones  were too large to have been carried there by chipmunks, and gray  squirrels were often completely absent from the areas. I suspect that  extensive trapping in the coniferous forests of "]]]
