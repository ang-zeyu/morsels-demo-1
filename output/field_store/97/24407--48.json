Sherman — Complete (#8)"],[1,"he should get there, to be forwarded to the  Department at Washington, and the duplicates to me.  These I did not  receive for more than a year.  I remember that I got my orders about  8 p. m. one night, and took passage in the boat for Brownsville, the  next morning traveled by stage from Brownsville to Cumberland,  Maryland, and thence by cars to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New  York, in a great hurry lest the ship might sail without me.  I found  Company F at Governor's Island, Captain C. Q. Tompkins in command,  Lieutenant E. O. C. Ord senior first-lieutenant, myself  junior first-lieutenant, Lucien Loeser and Charles Minor the  second-lieutenants.    The company had been filled up to one hundred privates, twelve  non-commissioned officers, and one ordnance sergeant (Layton),  making one hundred and thirteen enlisted men and five officers.  Dr. James L. Ord had been employed as acting assistant surgeon to  accompany the expedition, and Lieutenant H. W. Halleck, of the  engineers, was also to go along.  The United States store-ship  Lexington was then preparing at the Navy-Yard, Brooklyn, to carry  us around Cape Horn to California.  She was receiving on board the  necessary stores for the long voyage, and for service after our  arrival there.  Lieutenant-Commander Theodorus Bailey was in  command of the vessel, Lieutenant William H. Macomb executive  officer, and Passed-Midshipmen Muse, Spotts, and J. W. A.  Nicholson, were the watch-officers; Wilson purser, and Abernethy  surgeon.  The latter was caterer of the mess, and we all made an  advance of cash for him to lay in the necessary mess-stores.  To  enable us to prepare for so long a voyage and for an indefinite  sojourn in that far-off country, the War Department had authorized  us to draw six months' pay in advance, which sum of money we  invested in surplus clothing and such other things as seemed to us  necessary.  At last the ship was ready, and was towed down abreast  of Fort Columbus, where we were conveyed on board, and on the 14th  of July, 1846, we were towed to sea by a steam-tug, and cast off:  Colonel R. B. Mason, still superintendent of the general recruiting  service, accompanied us down the bay and out to sea, returning with  the tug.  A few other friends were of the party, but at last they  left us, and we were alone upon the sea, and the sailors were busy  with the sails and ropes.  The Lexington was an old ship, changed  from a sloop-of-war to a store-ship, with an after-cabin, a  \"ward-room,\" and \"between-decks.\"  In the cabin were Captains  Bailey and Tompkins, with whom messed the purser, Wilson.  In the  ward-room were all the other officers, two in each state-room; and  Minor, being an extra lieutenant, had to sleep in a hammock slung  in the ward-room.  Ord and I roomed together; Halleck and Loeser  and the others were scattered about.  The men were arranged in  bunks \"between-decks,\" one set along the sides of the ship, and  another, double tier, amidships.  The crew were slung in hammocks  well forward.  Of these there were about fifty.  We at once  subdivided the company into four squads, under the four lieutenants  of the company, and arranged with the naval officers that our men  should serve on deck by squads, after the manner of their watches;  that the sailors should do all the work aloft, and the soldiers on  deck.    On fair days we drilled our men at the manual, and generally kept  them employed as much as possible, giving great attention to the  police and cleanliness of their dress and bunks; and so successful  were we in this, that, though the voyage lasted nearly two hundred  days, every man was able to leave the ship and march up the hill to  the fort at Monterey, California, carrying his own knapsack and  equipments.    The voyage from New York to Rio Janeiro was without accident or any  thing to vary the usual monotony.  We soon settled down to the  humdrum of a long voyage, reading some, not much; playing games,  but never gambling; and chiefly engaged in eating our meals  regularly.  In crossing the equator we had the usual visit of  Neptune and his wife, who, with a large razor and a bucket of  soapsuds, came over the sides and shaved some of the greenhorns;  but naval etiquette exempted the officers, and Neptune was not  permitted to come aft of the mizzen-mast.  At last, after sixty  days of absolute monotony, the island of Raza, off Rio Janeiro, was  descried, and we slowly entered the harbor, passing a fort on our  right hand, from which came a hail, in the Portuguese language,  from a huge speaking-trumpet, and our officer of the deck answered  back in gibberish, according to a well-understood custom of the  place.  Sugar-loaf Mountain, on the south of the entrance, is very  remarkable and well named; is almost conical, with a slight lean.  The man-of-war anchorage is about five miles inside the heads,  directly in front of the city of Rio Janeiro.  Words will not  describe the beauty of this perfect harbor, nor the delightful  feeling after a long voyage of its fragrant airs, and the entire  contrast between all things there and what we had left in New York.    We found the United Staten frigate Columbia anchored there, and  after the Lexington was properly moored, nearly all the officers  went on shore for sight-seeing and enjoyment.  We landed at a wharf  opposite which was a famous French restaurant, Farroux, and after  ordering supper we all proceeded to the Rua da Ouvador, where most  of the shops were, especially those for making feather flowers, as  much to see the pretty girls as the flowers which they so  skillfully made; thence we went to the theatre, where, besides some  opera, we witnessed the audience and saw the Emperor Dom Pedro, and  his Empress, the daughter of the King of Sicily.  After the  theatre, we went back to the restaurant, where we had an excellent  supper, with fruits of every variety and excellence, such as we had  never seen before, or even knew the names of.  Supper being over,  we called for the bill, and it was rendered in French, with  Brazilian currency.  It footed up some twenty-six thousand reis.  The figures alarmed us, so we all put on the waiters' plate various  coins in gold, which he took to the counter and returned the  change, making the total about sixteen dollars.  The millreis is  about a dollar, but being a paper-money was at a discount, so as  only to be worth about fifty-six cents in coin.    The Lexington remained in Rio about a week, during which we visited  the Palace, a few miles in the country, also the Botanic Gardens, a  place of infinite interest, with its specimens of tropical fruits,  spices; etc., etc., and indeed every place of note.  The thing I  best recall is a visit Halleck and I made to the Corcovado, a high  mountain whence the water is conveyed for the supply of the city.  We started to take a walk, and passed along the aqueduct, which  approaches the city by a aeries of arches; thence up the point of  the hill to a place known as the Madre, or fountain, to which all  the water that drips from the leaves is conducted by tile gutters,  and is carried to the city by an open stone aqueduct.    Here we found Mr. Henry A. Wise, of Virginia, the United States  minister to Brazil, and a Dr. Garnett, United States Navy, his  intended son-in-law.  We had a very interesting conversation, in  which Mr. Wise enlarged on the fact that Rio was supplied from the  \"dews of heaven,\" for in the dry season the water comes from the  mists and fogs which hang around the Corcovado, drips from the  leaves of the trees, and is conducted to the Madre fountain by  miles of tile gutters.  Halleck and I continued our ascent of the  mountain, catching from points of the way magnificent views of the  scenery round about Rio Janeiro.  We reached near the summit what  was called the emperor's coffee-plantation, where we saw  coffee-berries in their various stages, and the scaffolds on which  the berries were dried before being cleaned.  The coffee-tree  reminded me of the red haw-tree of Ohio, and the berries were  somewhat like those of the same tree, two grains of coffee being  inclosed in one berry.  These were dried and cleaned of the husk by  hand or by machinery.  A short, steep ascent from this place  carried us to the summit, from which is beheld one of the most  picturesque views on earth.  The Organ Mountains to the west and  north, the ocean to the east, the city of Rio with its red-tiled  houses at our feet, and the entire harbor like a map spread out,  with innumerable bright valleys, make up a landscape that cannot be  described by mere words.  This spot is universally visited by  strangers, and has often been described.  After enjoying it  immeasurably, we returned to the city by another route, tired but  amply repaid by our long walk.    In due time all had been done that was requisite, and the Lexington  put to sea and resumed her voyage.  In October we approached Cape  Horn, the first land descried was Staten Island, white with snow,  and the ship seemed to be aiming for the channel to its west,  straits of Le Maire, but her course was changed and we passed  around to the east.  In time we saw Cape Horn; an island rounded  like an oven, after which it takes its name (Ornos) oven.  Here we  experienced very rough weather, buffeting about under storm  stay-sails, and spending nearly a month before the wind favored our  passage and enabled the course of the ship to be changed for  Valparaiso.  One day we sailed parallel with a French sloop-of-war,  and it was sublime to watch the two ships rising and falling in  those long deep swells of the ocean.  All the time we were followed  by the usual large flocks of Cape-pigeons and albatrosses of every  color.  The former resembled the common barn-pigeon exactly, but  are in fact gulls of beautiful and varied colors, mostly  dove-color.  We caught many with fishing-lines baited with pork.

Sheridan, General, United States Army — Complete (#8)"],[1,"into Rains's camp a squadron of Nesmith's battalion of Oregon  volunteers that we had mistaken for Indians, and who in turn believed  us to be the enemy.  When camp was reached, we all indulged in a  hearty laugh over the affair, and at the fright each party had given  the other.  The explanations which ensued proved that the squadron of  volunteers had separated from the column at the same time that I had  when we debouched from the canon, and had pursued an intermediate  trail through the hills, which brought it into the valley of the  Yakima at a point higher up the river than where I had struck it.    Next day we resumed our march up the valley, parallel to the Yakima.  About 1 o'clock we saw a large body of Indians on the opposite side  of the river, and the general commanding made up his mind to cross  and attack them.  The stream was cold, deep, and swift, still I  succeeded in passing my dragoons over safely, but had hardly got them  well on the opposite bank when the Indians swooped down upon us.  Dismounting my men, we received the savages with a heavy fire, which  brought them to a halt with some damage and more or less confusion.    General Rains now became very much excited and alarmed about me, and  endeavored to ford the swift river with his infantry and artillery,  but soon had to abandon the attempt, as three or four of the poor  fellows were swept off their feet and drowned.  Meantime Nesmith came  up with his mounted force, crossed over, and joined me.    The Indians now fell back to a high ridge, on the crest of which they  marched and countermarched, threatening to charge down its face.  Most of them were naked, and as their persons were painted in gaudy  colors and decorated with strips of red flannel, red blankets and gay  war-bonnets, their appearance presented a scene of picturesque  barbarism, fascinating but repulsive.  As they numbered about six  hundred, the chances of whipping them did not seem overwhelmingly in  our favor, yet Nesmith and I concluded we would give them a little  fight, provided we could engage them without going beyond the ridge.  But all our efforts were in vain, for as we advanced they retreated,  and as we drew back they reappeared and renewed their parade and  noisy demonstrations, all the time beating their drums and yelling  lustily.  They could not be tempted into a fight where we desired it,  however, and as we felt unequal to any pursuit beyond the ridge  without the assistance of the infantry and artillery, we re-crossed  the river and encamped with Rains.  It soon became apparent that the  noisy demonstrations of the Indians were intended only as a blind to  cover the escape of their women and children to a place of safety in  the mountains.    Next morning we took up our march without crossing the river; and as  our route would lead us by the point on the opposite bank where the  Indians had made their picturesque display the day before, they at an  early hour came over to our side, and rapidly moved ahead of us to  some distant hills, leaving in our pathway some of the more  venturesome young braves, who attempted, to retard our advance by  opening fire at long range from favorable places where they lay  concealed.  This fire did us little harm, but it had the effect of  making our progress so slow that the patience of every one but  General Rains was well-nigh exhausted.    About 2 o'clock in the afternoon we arrived well up near the base of  the range of hills, and though it was growing late we still had time  to accomplish something, but our commanding officer decided that it  was best to go into camp, and make a systematic attack next morning.  I proposed that he let me charge with my dragoons through the narrow  canon where the river broke through the range, while the infantry  should charge up the hill and drive the enemy from the top down on  the other side.  In this way I thought we might possibly catch some  of the fugitives, but his extreme caution led him to refuse the  suggestion, so we pitched our tents out of range of their desultory  fire, but near enough to observe plainly their menacing and  tantalizing exhibitions of contempt.    In addition to firing occasionally, they called us all sorts of bad  names, made indecent gestures, and aggravated us, so that between 3  and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, by an inexplicable concert of action,  and with a serious breach of discipline, a large number of the men  and many of the officers broke en masse from the camp with loud yells  and charged the offending savages.  As soon as this mob got within  musket-shot they opened fire on the Indians, who ran down the other  face of the ridge without making the slightest resistance.  The hill  was readily taken by this unmilitary proceeding, and no one was hurt  on either side, but as Rains would not permit it to be held, a large  bonfire was lighted on the crest in celebration of the victory, and  then all hands marched back to camp, where they had no sooner arrived  and got settled down than the Indians returned to the summit of the  ridge, seemingly to enjoy the fire that had been so generously built  for their benefit, and with renewed taunts and gestures continued to  insult us.    Our camp that night was strongly picketed, and when we awoke in the  morning the Indians still occupied their position on the hill.  At  daylight we advanced against them, two or three companies of infantry  moving forward to drive them from the summit, while our main column  passed through the canon into the upper Yakima Valley led by my  dragoons, who were not allowed to charge into the gorge, as the  celerity of such a movement might cause the tactical combination to  fail.    As we passed slowly and cautiously through the canon the Indians ran  rapidly away, and when we reached the farther end they had entirely  disappeared from our front, except one old fellow, whose lame horse  prevented him keeping up with the main body.  This presented an  opportunity for gaining results which all thought should not be lost,  so our guide, an Indian named \"Cut-mouth John,\" seized upon it, and  giving hot chase, soon, overtook the poor creature, whom he speedily  killed without much danger to himself, for the fugitive was armed  with only an old Hudson's Bay flint-lock horse-pistol which could not  be discharged.    \"Cut-mouth John's\" engagement began and ended all the fighting that  took place on this occasion, and much disappointment and discontent  followed, Nesmith's mounted force and my dragoons being particularly  disgusted because they had not been \"given a chance.\"  During the  remainder of the day we cautiously followed the retreating foe, and  late in the evening went into camp a short distance from Father  Pandoza's Mission; where we were to await a small column of troops  under command of Captain Maurice Maloney, of the Fourth Infantry,  that was to join us from Steilicom by way of the Natchez Pass, and  from which no tidings had as yet been received.    Next morning the first thing I saw when I put my head out from my  blankets was \"Cut-mouth John,\" already mounted and parading himself  through the camp.  The scalp of the Indian he had despatched the day  before was tied to the cross-bar of his bridle bit, the hair dangling  almost to the ground, and John was decked out in the sacred vestments  of Father Pandoza, having, long before any one was stirring in camp,  ransacked the log-cabin at the Mission in which the good man had  lived.  John was at all times a most repulsive looking individual, a  part of his mouth having been shot away in a fight with Indians near  Walla Walla some years before, in which a Methodist missionary had  been killed; but his revolting personal appearance was now worse than  ever, and the sacrilegious use of Father Pandoza's vestments, coupled  with the ghastly scalp that hung from his bridle, so turned opinion  against him that he was soon captured, dismounted, and his parade  brought to an abrupt close, and I doubt whether he ever after quite  reinstated himself in the good graces of the command.    In the course of the day nearly all the men visited the Mission, but  as it had been plundered by the Indians at the outbreak of  hostilities, when Father Pandoza was carried off, little of value was  left about it except a considerable herd of pigs, which the father  with great difficulty had succeeded in accumulating from a very small  beginning.  The pigs had not been disturbed by the Indians, but the  straggling troops soon disposed of them, and then turned their  attention to the cabbages and potatoes in the garden, with the  intention, no doubt, of dining that day on fresh pork and fresh  vegetables instead of on salt junk and hard bread, which formed their  regular diet on the march.  In digging up the potatoes some one  discovered half a keg of powder, which had been buried in the garden  by the good father to prevent the hostile Indians from getting it to  use against the whites.  As soon as this was unearthed wild  excitement ensued, and a cry arose that Father Pandoza was the person  who furnished powder to the Indians; that here was the proof; that at  last the mysterious means by which the Indians obtained ammunition  was explained--and a rush was made for the mission building. This was  a comfortable log-house of good size, built by the Indians for a  school and church, and attached to one end was the log-cabin  residence of the priest.  Its destruction was a matter of but a few  moments.  A large heap of dry wood was quickly collected and piled in  the building, matches applied, and the whole Mission, including the  priest's house, was soon enveloped in flames, and burned to the  ground before the officers in camp became aware of the disgraceful  plundering in which their men were engaged.    The commanding officer having received no news from Captain Maloney  during the day, Colonel Nesmith and I were ordered to go to his "]]]
