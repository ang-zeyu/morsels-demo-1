Even the mighty Akron swings around easily at anchorage, heads      into the wind like a weather vane, its control car resting on the      ground.]    In building this ship, Mr. Litchfield and his company indicated their  belief in the value of big airships for trans-oceanic travel, for which  the blimps would provide inexpensive training for pilots, and experience  in operating under varying weather conditions.    The Pilgrim, the Puritan, the Vigilant, the Mayflower and the rest of  the Goodyear fleet which followed--named after cup defenders in  international yacht racing--would also uncover during the course of  day-after-day operations, improvements in ships and operating technique,  which would be available to its customers, the Army and Navy.    In building its own ships, Goodyear was following the tradition of  American industry, which does not sit back and merely build goods to  order, but has sought by developing better goods to anticipate and  stimulate customer demand. In the automobile industry, for example,  self-starters, closed cars, steel bodies, balloon tires, streamlining,  and the rest were initiated by industry to increase public acceptance  and further popularize the automobile. By building its own airships and  flying them, Goodyear hoped to expand the market for military and  commercial airships.    The doldrum period, which made progress difficult, came to an end with  dramatic suddenness. In the year 1927 a youthful pilot flew an airplane,  alone, across the Atlantic ocean, and in the following year a  middle-aged scientist made a round trip from Europe to America by  airship, with 24 people aboard. The imagination of America and the world  took fire. Aeronautics started anew.    Perhaps no events in years have appealed so fully to the public  consciousness or had such dynamic effects. Almost from the day of  Lindbergh's flight and the Graf Zeppelin's arrival at Lakehurst,  aeronautical engineers found themselves with money to spend in research  and machinery. Airports unrolled across the carpet of America, night  lighting came in, pilots became business men, appropriations were rushed  through Congress, state assemblies, and city councils, and aeronautics  became Big Business almost over night. The period of inaction and of  reaction was over.                                         CHAPTER VI                     Airship Improvements Between Wars          [Illustration: Docked airship]    The wartime airship was a cigar-shaped gas bag with an airplane cockpit,  open to the weather, slung below. The contrast between it and the sleek,  fast, streamlined Navy airship of today is almost as striking as that  between wartime planes and automobiles and modern ones.    Many improvements have been made, even though the airship has not had  the experience of building thousands of units, as the automobile and  airplane have had, or ample funds for research and experiment. Less than  150 non-rigid airships have been built all told since 1914.    The \"B\" type blimp, chiefly used in the World War, contained 80,000  cubic feet of hydrogen, though some British and French non-rigids were  built in larger sizes, and the United States Navy \"C\" ships, toward the  end of the war, had 200,000 cubic feet of lifting gas. These compare  with the 416,000 cubic feet of helium in the new Navy \"K\" ships. Speed,  under the pressure of war needs moved up from 47 miles in the \"B\" to  close to 60 in the \"C,\" but is around 80 in today's \"K\" ships.    Wartime ships carried three to five men and a day's fuel. Today's carry  eight or ten, enough pilots, radio men, navigators, riggers and  mechanics for two full watches, though normally everyone is on duty  during patrols. The \"B\" was good for perhaps 900 miles, the \"K\" for well  over twice that distance.    Wartime ships had to keep the control car well away from the bag to  prevent sparks from igniting the hydrogen gas. A windshield was the  pilot's only protection from the elements. Modern ships, using  non-inflammable helium, have closed cars, streamlined into the bag,  ample room for navigation and radio, sleeping and eating quarters, even  a photographic dark room, can be heated and noise-proofed.    Early airships were pulled down and held by a large ground crew, a  pneumatic bumper bag on the car cushioning its landing. Today's ships  land on a swiveled wheel, roll up to a mast--or taxi off across the  airport like an airplane and take off.    These, however, are merely flight factors. More important is it that the  wartime blimp was to a large extent hangar-bound. It could go no further  from its base than it could safely return before its fuel was exhausted.    Today's ships are expeditionary craft, can go almost anywhere, stay as  long as they want. They are no longer land-bound, can be refueled and  reserviced at sea. They are much safer, rank high in this respect among  all carriers whether on land, sea or in the air.    Three independent lines of study contributed to these results, those of  the Army, Navy and Goodyear, each free to follow its own ideas, to  observe results found by the others, adopt them, use them as starting  points for further developments, or discard them.    The improvements were achieved in a relatively short period. The army  started in after the war and carried on a continuing program till 1932.  The Navy, absorbed in its rigid airships, did not get into non-rigids  till the early 1930's. Goodyear built the Pilgrim in 1925 but its  development program really began with the blimp fleet in 1929.    Noteworthy improvement was found during this period in materials,  structure, design, engines and radio communication, with outstanding  advances along three major lines.    First was increased safety, permitted by helium gas. Wartime airships  used hydrogen because it was all they had, had to develop what  protection they could against fire through construction devices and  operating technique. Hydrogen was not only inflammable, but under  certain conditions explosive. World War pilots had to fly their hydrogen  ships through thunder and lightning storms, dodge inflammatory bullets  if they could. Zeppelin sailors wore felt shoes, with no nails to create  a spark, used frogs for buttons, had to guard against static.    It was a fortunate thing for the airship world when a gas was found in  1907 in Dexter, Kansas, which would not burn. Curious scientists, asking  why, found it was helium, a gas previously identified (in 1869) only in  the rays of the sun. Helium gas is inert, refusing to combine with any  other element, does not deteriorate metal or fabric. It was not much  heavier than hydrogen, the lightest of all gases, so proved a welcome  gift to lighter-than-air.    For some reason, not explained except on the theory that Providence  takes special interest in America, helium has been found in quantity  only in this country. It is a component, present to the extent of two or  three percent in certain natural gas, though ranging as high as eight or  ten percent in favored areas. It can be separated by compression and  liquefaction from the natural gas,--which is that much improved by the  removal of the non-inflammable content.    The world's chief known supply of helium lies in certain sections of  Texas, Kansas, Colorado and Utah. More important, United States is the  only country having great pipe lines, can distribute natural gas from  Texas to cities as far away as Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago.  Without such a market operators would have to separate and release the  95% of natural gas to get the 5% of helium, and costs would be still  higher.    Helium is perhaps the most useful of the few natural monopolies given to  this country.    It was only toward the end of the World War, however, that Army  engineers worked out a process of separating helium from natural gas. A  plant was built at Fort Worth and the first cylinders of helium had  reached New Orleans ready for shipment to France to inflate observation  balloons when the Armistice was signed.    Army, Navy and Bureau of Mine engineers worked thereafter to increase  production and cut costs, but as late as 1925 Will Rogers called  attention to the fact that the Navy had not been able to get enough  helium to supply both the Shenandoah and the Los Angeles at the same  time. If one was using the helium the other had to stay home. Two ships,  and only one set of helium, he commented.    The use of helium cut the casualty list on the Shenandoah, would have  saved the Hindenburg. Non-rigid airships have had no fire or explosive  accidents since helium came into use as the lifting gas.    It was the loss by a hydrogen fire of the Italian-built Roma, after it  struck a high tension line at Langley Field in February, 1922, which  fixed the policy of \"helium only\" for U. S. Army and Navy airships. The  Army's C-7 was the first airship to use helium. In building the Pilgrim  in 1925, Goodyear followed the same policy--even though it had to pay  $125 a thousand cubic feet for helium while it could have obtained  hydrogen for $5 per thousand.    Further improvements and increasing volume of production brought the  cost down in time from $125 to less than $20, and helium expense became  relatively "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5157"],[0,"How I Found Livingstone (#8)"],[1,"thorn in my side. I was invited  to his comfortable house to partake of coffee. I went there: the coffee  was good though sugarless, his promises were many, but they proved  valueless. Said he to me, \"I am your friend; I wish to serve you., what  can I do for you?\" Replied I, \"I am obliged to you, I need a good friend  who, knowing the language and Customs of the Wanyamwezi, can procure me  the pagazis I need and send me off quickly. Your brother is acquainted  with the Wasungu (white men), and knows that what they promise they make  good. Get me a hundred and forty pagazis and I will pay you your price.\"  With unctuous courtesy, the reptile I was now warmly nourishing; said,  \"I do not want anything from you, my friend, for such a slight service,  rest content and quiet; you shall not stop here fifteen days. To-morrow  morning I will come and overhaul your bales to see what is needed.\" I  bade him good morning, elated with the happy thought that I was soon to  tread the Unyanyembe road.    The reader must be made acquainted with two good and sufficient reasons  why I was to devote all my energy to lead the Expedition as quickly as  possible from Bagamoyo.    First, I wished to reach Ujiji before the news reached Livingstone that  I was in search of him, for my impression of him was that he was a man  who would try to put as much distance as possible between us, rather  than make an effort to shorten it, and I should have my long journey for  nothing.    Second, the Masika, or rainy season, would soon be on me, which, if it  caught me at Bagamoyo, would prevent my departure until it was over,  which meant a delay of forty days, and exaggerated as the rains were by  all men with whom I came in contact, it rained every day for forty days  without intermission. This I knew was a thing to dread; for I had my  memory stored with all kinds of rainy unpleasantnesses. For instance,  there was the rain of Virginia and its concomitant horrors--wetness,  mildew, agues, rheumatics, and such like; then there were the English  rains, a miserable drizzle causing the blue devils; then the rainy  season of Abyssinia with the flood-gates of the firmament opened, and  an universal down-pour of rain, enough to submerge half a continent in  a few hours; lastly, there was the pelting monsoon of India, a steady  shut-in-house kind of rain. To which of these rains should I compare  this dreadful Masika of East Africa? Did not Burton write much about  black mud in Uzaramo? Well, a country whose surface soil is called black  mud in fine weather, what can it be called when forty days' rain beat on  it, and feet of pagazis and donkeys make paste of it? These were natural  reflections, induced by the circumstances of the hour, and I found  myself much exercised in mind in consequence.    Ali bin Salim, true to his promise, visited my camp on the morrow, with  a very important air, and after looking at the pile of cloth bales,  informed me that I must have them covered with mat-bags. He said he  would send a man to have them measured, but he enjoined me not to make  any bargain for the bags, as he would make it all right.    While awaiting with commendable patience the 140 pagazis promised by  Ali bin Salim we were all employed upon everything that thought could  suggest needful for crossing the sickly maritime region, so that we  might make the transit before the terrible fever could unnerve us,  and make us joyless. A short experience at Bagamoya showed us what we  lacked, what was superfluous, and what was necessary. We were visited  one night by a squall, accompanied by furious rain. I had $1,500 worth  of pagazi cloth in my tent. In the morning I looked and lo! the drilling  had let in rain like a sieve, and every yard of cloth was wet. It  occupied two days afterwards to dry the cloths, and fold them again. The  drill-tent was condemned, and a No. 5 hemp-canvas tent at onto prepared.  After which I felt convinced that my cloth bales, and one year's  ammunition, were safe, and that I could defy the Masika.    In the hurry of departure from Zanzibar, and in my ignorance of how  bales should be made, I had submitted to the better judgment and ripe  experience of one Jetta, a commission merchant, to prepare my bales for  carriage. Jetta did not weigh the bales as he made them up, but piled  the Merikani, Kaniki, Barsati, Jamdani, Joho, Ismahili, in alternate  layers, and roped the same into bales. One or two pagazis came to my  camp and began to chaffer; they wished to see the bales first, before  they would make a final bargain. They tried to raise them up--ugh! ugh!  it was of no use, and withdrew. A fine Salter's spring balance was hung  up, and a bale suspended to the hook; the finger indicated 105 lbs. or  3 frasilah, which was just 35 lbs. or one frasilah overweight. Upon  putting all the bales to this test, I perceived that Jetta's guess-work,  with all his experience, had caused considerable trouble to me.    The soldiers were set to work to reopen and repack, which latter task  is performed in the following manner:--We cut a doti, or four yards  of Merikani, ordinarily sold at Zanzibar for $2.75 the piece of thirty  yards, and spread out. We take a piece or bolt of good Merikani, and  instead of the double fold given it by the Nashua and Salem mills, we  fold it into three parts, by which the folds have a breadth of a foot;  this piece forms the first layer, and will weigh nine pounds; the second  layer consists of six pieces of Kaniki, a blue stuff similar to the  blouse stuff of France, and the blue jeans of America, though much  lighter; the third layer is formed of the second piece of Merikani, the  fourth of six more pieces of Kaniki, the fifth of Merikani, the sixth  of Kaniki as before, and the seventh and last of Merikani. We have thus  four pieces of Merikani, which weigh 36 lbs., and 18 pieces of Kaniki  weighing also 36 lbs., making a total of 72 lbs., or a little more than  two frasilahs; the cloth is then folded singly over these layers, each  corner tied to another. A bundle of coir-rope is then brought, and two  men, provided with a wooden mallet for beating and pressing the bale,  proceed to tie it up with as much nicety as sailors serve down rigging.    When complete, a bale is a solid mass three feet and a half long, a  foot deep, and a foot wide. Of these bales I had to convey eighty-two to  Unyanyembe, forty of which consisted solely of the Merikani and Kaniki.  The other forty-two contained the Merikani and coloured cloths, which  latter were to serve as honga or tribute cloths, and to engage another  set of pagazis from Unyanyembe to Ujiji, and from Ujiji to the regions  beyond.    The fifteenth day asked of me by Ali bin Salim for the procuring of the  pagazis passed by, and there was not the ghost of a pagazi in my camp.  I sent Mabruki the Bullheaded to Ali bin Salim, to convey my salaams and  express a hope that he had kept his word. In half an hour's time Mabruki  returned with the reply of the Arab, that in a few days he would be able  to collect them all; but, added Mabruki, slyly, \"Bana, I don't believe  him. He said aloud to himself, in my hearing, 'Why should I get the  Musungu pagazis? Seyd Burghash did not send a letter to me, but to the  Jemadar. Why should I trouble myself about him? Let Seyd Burghash write  me a letter to that purpose, and I will procure them within two days.\"'    To my mind this was a time for action: Ali bin Salim should see that it  was ill trifling with a white man in earnest to start. I rode down to  his house to ask him what he meant.    His reply was, Mabruki had told a lie as black as his face. He had never  said anything approaching to such a thing. He was willing to become my  slave--to become a pagazi himself. But here I stopped the voluble Ali,  and informed him that I could not think of employing him in the capacity  of a pagazi, neither could I find it in my heart to trouble Seyd  Burghash to write a direct letter to him, or to require of a man who  had deceived me once, as Ali bin Salim had, any service of any nature  whatsoever. It would be better, therefore, if Ali bin Salim would stay  away from my camp, and not enter it either in person or by proxy.    I had lost fifteen days, for Jemadar Sadur, at Kaole, had never stirred  from his fortified house in that village in my service, save to pay a  visit, after the receipt of the Sultan's letter. Naranji, custom-house  agent at Kaoie, solely under the thumb of the great Ludha Damji, had  not responded to Ludha's worded request that he would procure pagazis,  except with winks, nods, and promises, and it is but just stated how I  fared at the hands of Ali bin Salim. In this extremity I remembered the  promise made to me by the great merchant of Zanzibar--Tarya Topan--a  Mohammedan Hindi--that he would furnish me with a letter to a young man  named Soor Hadji Palloo, who was said to be the best man in Bagamoyo to  procure a supply of pagazis.    I despatched my Arab interpreter by a dhow to Zanzibar, with a very  earnest request to Capt. Webb that he would procure from Tarya Topan the  introductory letter so long delayed. It was the last card in my hand.    On the third day the Arab returned, bringing with him not only the  letter to Soor Hadji Palloo, but an abundance of good things from  the ever-hospitable house of Mr. Webb. In a very short time after the  receipt of his letter, the eminent young man Soor Hadji Palloo came to  visit me, and informed me he had been requested by Tarya Topan to hire  for me one hundred and forty pagazis to Unyanyembe in the shortest time  possible. This he said would be very expensive, for there were scores  of Arabs and Wasawabili merchants on the look out for every caravan that  came in from the interior, and they paid 20 doti, or 80 yards of cloth,  to each pagazi. Not willing or able to pay more, many of these merchants  had been waiting as long as six months before they"]]]
