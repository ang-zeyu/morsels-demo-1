The point to keep in mind when trapping for otter, is that they are  very shy of the scent of man; more so perhaps than any other animal,  and unless great care is observed, are likely to be frightened  entirely out of the locality in which you are trapping. This human  scent theory is disputed by some trappers, but I speak from my own  experience, and from the experience of many expert trappers with whom  I am acquainted. If one will use a little judgment he will readily  understand why human scent is alarming to many wild animals. Man is  the natural enemy of all wild animal life, and all wild creatures  realize this fact. Now you will see that any indications of the  presence of man, puts the animal on its guard; especially is this the  case in the wilderness where the animals are not accustomed to seeing  the tracks of man wherever they go. When an animals finds human  scent, he has positive proof that man has been in that vicinity.    Footprints and other human signs, if there is no scent, are not so  alarming, as they are likely to be mistaken for signs made by some  wild animal. Although the animals of the wilderness are more afraid  of human scent than those found in the settled countries, they are  just as easily trapped. The more wary animals found in settled parts,  are always looking for danger because of the continued presence of  man in their locality, but on the other hand, they are not likely to  be frightened by human scent because it is a common thing to them.    As mentioned before the otter is sure to visit the beavers, if there  are any about, so if you know of a family of beavers, go to that  place and if you can find an old beaver dam, on the stream  somewhere, below where the beavers are located, make a break in the  center of this dam, so that all of the water will flow through this  opening, and set the trap in the water, in the upper end of this  passage. Narrow down the passage to about eight inches, by driving a  few old stakes on each side of the trap. The trap may be staked, but  it is better, if the water is deep enough, to use a sliding pole, so  that the captured animal will drown. No covering is needed on the  trap, but after it is set, the entire setting should be drenched with  water, to remove the human scent. This is an excellent set and will  remain in working order until late in the fall, as the water  immediately above the break in the dam will not freeze until long  after other water is closed by ice. Even in the coldest weather this  set may be kept from freezing by roofing it over with evergreen  boughs, and banking it well with snow.    Beavers and beaver dams are not found in every locality, but wherever  otters are found traveling on small streams, they may be trapped in  the following manner:    Find a narrow place in the stream, where the water flows smoothly,  and narrow up the stream by placing a bunch of old dead brush in each  side, leaving a passage of about eight inches in the middle. Lay a  few stones among the brush to keep them in place. Set the trap in the  opening, and splash water over the brush and banks. The trap may be  staked but it is better to fasten to a clog. Cut a small sapling of  such a size that the ring of the chain will just pass over the butt  of the sapling. Slip the ring over the clog and fasten it by  splitting the butt and drive a wedge in the split, or by driving a  staple over the ring. The clog may be placed on the upper side of the  brush, used to block the stream, and the top may be tied to the  shore, so that it will not be carried away by high water. In very  small streams, a narrow passage may be made, by simply placing a few  stones in either side, leaving a narrow passage in the middle, in  which to set the trap.    When you can find a sharp bend in the stream, with a trail across the  point, set the trap in the water, at the end of the trail. Use same  care as advised for the other sets.    For spring trapping this method is excellent: if you can find one of  the otter's landing places on the bank, prepare the place for setting  in the fall in the following manner: Make a nest for the trap in the  center of the trail and fill the nest with grass and leaves. Lay a  bunch of dead brush or a chunk of rotten wood on each side of the  trail, so as to leave only a narrow passage and cut a clog and lay it  in place. The otters seldom visit these places in the fall, so there  is no danger of frightening them. In the spring, before the snow is  all gone, go and set your trap in the place prepared, covering with  the leaves and grass, and attach to the clog, covering the entire  setting with a little snow. As the snow melts, it takes with it all  of the scent and signs, leaving the trap ready for the first otter  that comes along.    If you do not find the landing places until after the snow is gone,  set the traps just the same, washing the scent away by sprinkling  with water, or set the traps in the water where the otter climbs up  the bank.      [Illustration: Otter Trap Set Under Ice.]    Another very good method for spring trapping, is to set the trap in  the edge of the water, where the bank bluffs a little, sticking up a  few fresh cut, green sticks behind the trap, and at the sides. Post a  piece of the dried oil castor of the beaver on a stick, behind the  trap, and about ten inches high. The ordinary beaver castor is also  good. The oil castor is very attractive to the otter, and the green  sticks are also attractive, as the otter mistakes them for beaver  cutting. Always fasten the trap so the animal will drown, as you are  likely to catch a beaver in this set.    One of the best methods of trapping otter in winter, after the  streams are closed with ice, is as follows: Find a long pool of still  water, where you are sure the otter will be traveling under the ice,  and at either end of this pool, where the water is about ten inches  deep, cut a hole through the ice, make a pen of dead sticks in the  water, making the pen about nine inches wide, by twelve or fifteen  inches deep. Now take a fish and fasten it to a stick, in the back of  the pen, and set the trap in the entrance, staking it securely. Drive  the stake about ten inches in front of the pen, and directly in front  of the trap. The object in this is to cause the otter, in entering,  to twist his body, in which act, he will put his foot down in the  trap. Throw some snow in the hole, so it will freeze over. The bait  should be renewed once a week. In case you cannot get fish for bait,  use the head of a rabbit, the breast of a partridge, or a piece of  muskrat. The bait should be skinned.    The otter will also be attracted by any white object. I know a  trapper who caught one in this way by baiting with a white door knob,  and the Indians sometimes use a piece of fresh peeled poplar for  bait.    If the ice has formed when the water was above its usual level, there  will be an air space, between the water and the ice. In such a case,  cut a hole through the ice at the edge of the water, placing a piece  of beaver castor on a stick behind the trap. The hole may be closed  by covering with a block of ice.    When the otter has been working on a lake for some time, you will  find where he has been coming out at the springholes, which are found  on nearly all lakes. In such places the water is always shallow, and  a trap may be set on the bottom directly under the hole. Great care  must be used however, for if the otter is not caught the first time  he comes out, he will be frightened away.    Otters often land on the logs which project into the water. When you  can find such a log, cut a notch for a trap, so that it will set  about two inches deep, and place some mud in the notch so as to hide  the fresh cutting. Some very successful trappers, set their traps in  this way, and place some good scent on the log, above the trap.    If you can find an otter slide, find the place where the animal lands  on the bank to visit the slide, and set the trap under about two  inches of water.    The Nos. 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 Newhouse traps were designed especially for  trapping otters on their slides. The trap should be set at the foot  of the slide, so as to catch the animal by the breast or body.    Otters often travel in pairs, and it is usually advisable to set two  or three traps on one stream.    Do not make your camp near the stream, and do not travel along the  stream more than necessary. In looking at the traps, do not go too  close, unless the traps need your attention.    There is no way in which the sea otter can be trapped and they are  hunted only with rifles. The methods employed in hunting them have  been very successful and as a consequence the animal has been  practically exterminated.    The track of the otter is peculiar, owing to their strange mode of  travel. As before mentioned their method of travel is a series of  plunging slides and in the snow they make a deep furrow, their  footprints being from four to eight feet apart, according to the  \"sliding conditions\". When two or more are traveling in company, they  will usually all run in the same trail. Their tracks are as a rule,  only seen on lakes and streams, but occasionally they will go  overland from one stream to another. The footprints will measure  about one and one-half or one and three-fourths inches in length and  about the same in width.      [Illustration: The Beaver.]        CHAPTER VIII.    THE BEAVER.    When this country was first explored and settled, beavers were found  in good numbers throughout the United States and Canada, but at  present they are extinct in many of the states where they were once  abundant. Today they are found in fair numbers throughout the greater  part of Canada and Alaska, also in a few of the northern and western  states. There are also a few beavers found in the south at the  present time. However, many of the states, as well "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],[0,"Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#8)"],[1,"as foolish as you did  this time.\"    Rabbit started to return to his home. When he had nearly completed his  journey he came to a little creek, and being thirsty took a good long  drink. While he was drinking he heard a noise as though a wolf or cat  was scratching the earth. Looking up to a hill which overhung the creek,  he saw four wolves, with their tails intertwined, pulling with all their  might. As Rabbit came up to them one pulled loose, and Rabbit saw that  his tail was broken.    \"Let me pull tails with you. My tail is long and strong,\" said Rabbit,  and the wolves assenting, Rabbit interlocked his long tail with those  of the three wolves and commenced pulling and the wolves pulled so  hard that they pulled Rabbit's tail off at the second joint. The wolves  disappeared.    \"Cinye! Cinye! (Brother, brother.) I have lost my tail,\" cried Rabbit.  The genie came and seeing his brother Rabbit's tail missing, said: \"You  look better without a tail anyway.\"    From that time on rabbits have had no tails.              UNKTOMI AND THE ARROWHEADS    There were once upon a time two young men who were very great friends,  and were constantly together. One was a very thoughtful young man, the  other very impulsive, who never stopped to think before he committed an  act.    One day these two friends were walking along, telling each other of  their experiences in love making. They ascended a high hill, and on  reaching the top, heard a ticking noise as if small stones or pebbles  were being struck together.    Looking around they discovered a large spider sitting in the midst of  a great many flint arrowheads. The spider was busily engaged making the  flint rocks into arrow heads. They looked at the spider, but he never  moved, but continued hammering away on a piece of flint which he had  nearly completed into another arrowhead.    \"Let's hit him,\" said the thoughtless one. \"No,\" said the other, \"he is  not harming any one; in fact, he is doing a great good, as he is making  the flint arrowheads which we use to point our arrows.\"    \"Oh, you are afraid,\" said the first young man. \"He can't harm you, just  watch me hit him.\" So saying, he picked up an arrowhead and throwing it  at \"Unktomi,\" hit him on the side. As Unktomi rolled over on his side,  got up and stood looking at them, the young man laughed and said: \"Well,  let us be going, as your grandfather, \"Unktomi,\" doesn't seem to like  our company.\" They started down the hill, when suddenly the one who had  hit Unktomi took a severe fit of coughing. He coughed and coughed, and  finally small particles of blood came from his mouth. The blood kept  coming thicker and in great gushes. Finally it came so thick and fast  that the man could not get his breath and fell upon the ground dead.    The thoughtful young man, seeing that his friend was no more, hurried  to the village and reported what had happened. The relatives and friends  hurried to the hill, and sure enough, there lay the thoughtless young  man still and cold in death. They held a council and sent for the chief  of the Unktomi tribe. When he heard what had happened, he told the  council that he could do nothing to his Unktomi, as it had only defended  itself.    Said he: \"My friends, seeing that your tribe was running short of  arrowheads, I set a great many of my tribe to work making flint  arrowheads for you. When my men are thus engaged they do not wish to  be disturbed, and your young man not only disturbed my man, but grossly  insulted him by striking him with one of the arrowheads which he had  worked so hard to make. My man could not sit and take this insult, so  as the young man walked away the Unktomi shot him with a very tiny  arrowhead. This produced a hemorrhage, which caused his death. So now,  my friends, if you will fill and pass the peace pipe, we will part  good friends and my tribe shall always furnish you with plenty of flint  arrowheads.\" So saying, Unktomi Tanka finished his peace smoke and  returned to his tribe.    Ever after that, when the Indians heard a ticking in the grass, they  would go out of their way to get around the sound, saying, Unktomi is  making arrowheads; we must not disturb him.    Thus it was that Unktomi Tanka (Big Spider) had the respect of this  tribe, and was never after disturbed in his work of making arrowheads.            THE BEAR AND THE RABBIT HUNT BUFFALO    Once upon a time there lived as neighbors, a bear and a rabbit. The  rabbit was a good shot, and the bear being very clumsy could not use the  arrow to good advantage. The bear was very unkind to the rabbit. Every  morning, the bear would call over to the rabbit and say: \"Take your bow  and arrows and come with me to the other side of the hill. A large herd  of buffalo are grazing there, and I want you to shoot some of them for  me, as my children are crying for meat.\"    The rabbit, fearing to arouse the bear's anger by refusing, consented,  and went with the bear, and shot enough buffalo to satisfy the hungry  family. Indeed, he shot and killed so many that there was lots of meat  left after the bear and his family had loaded themselves, and packed all  they could carry home. The bear being very gluttonous, and not wanting  the rabbit to get any of the meat, said: \"Rabbit, you come along home  with us and we will return and get the remainder of the meat.\"    The poor rabbit could not even taste the blood from the butchering, as  the bear would throw earth on the blood and dry it up. Poor Rabbit would  have to go home hungry after his hard day's work.    The bear was the father of five children. The youngest boy was very kind  to the rabbit. The mother bear, knowing that her youngest was a very  hearty eater, always gave him an extra large piece of meat. What the  baby bear did not eat, he would take outside with him and pretend to  play ball with it, kicking it toward the rabbit's house, and when he  got close to the door he would give the meat such a great kick, that it  would fly into the rabbit's house, and in this way poor Rabbit would get  his meal unknown to the papa bear.    Baby bear never forgot his friend Rabbit. Papa bear often wondered why  his baby would go outside after each meal. He grew suspicious and asked  the baby where he had been. \"Oh, I always play ball outside, around the  house, and when I get tired playing I eat up my meat ball and then come  in.\"    The baby bear was too cunning to let papa bear know that he was keeping  his friend rabbit from starving to death. Nevertheless, papa bear  suspected baby and said: \"Baby, I think you go over to the rabbit's  after every meal.\"    The four older brothers were very handsome, but baby bear was a little  puny fellow, whose coat couldn't keep out much cold, as it was short and  shaggy, and of a dirty brown color. The three older brothers were very  unkind to baby bear, but the fourth one always took baby's part, and was  always kind to his baby brother.    Rabbit was getting tired of being ordered and bullied around by papa  bear. He puzzled his brain to scheme some way of getting even with Mr.  Bear for abusing him so much. He studied all night long, but no scheme  worth trying presented itself. Early one morning Mr. Bear presented  himself at Rabbit's door.    \"Say, Rabbit, my meat is all used up, and there is a fine herd of  buffalo grazing on the hillside. Get your bow and arrows and come with  me. I want you to shoot some of them for me.\"    \"Very well,\" said Rabbit, and he went and killed six buffalo for Bear.  Bear got busy butchering and poor Rabbit, thinking he would get a chance  to lick up one mouthful of blood, stayed very close to the bear while he  was cutting up the meat. The bear was very watchful lest the rabbit get  something to eat. Despite bear's watchfulness, a small clot of blood  rolled past and behind the bear's feet. At once Rabbit seized the clot  and hid it in his bosom. By the time Rabbit got home, the blood clot  was hardened from the warmth of his body, so, being hungry, it put Mr.  Rabbit out of sorts to think that after all his trouble he could not eat  the blood.    Very badly disappointed, he lay down on his floor and gazed up into the  chimney hole. Disgusted with the way things had turned out, he grabbed  up the blood clot and threw it up through the hole. Scarcely had it  hit the ground when he heard the voice of a baby crying, \"Ate! Ate!\"  (father, father). He went outside and there he found a big baby boy. He  took the baby into his house and threw him out through the hole again.  This time the boy was large enough to say \"Ate, Ate, he-cun-sin-lo.\"  (Father, father, don't do that). But nevertheless, he threw him up and  out again. On going out the third time, there stood a handsome youth  smiling at him. Rabbit at once adopted the youth and took him into his  house, seating him in the seat of honor (which is directly opposite  the entrance), and saying: \"My son, I want you to be a good, honest,  straightforward man. Now, I have in my possession a fine outfit, and  you, my son, shall wear it.\"    Suiting his action to his words, he drew out a bag from a hollow tree  and on opening it, drew out a fine buckskin shirt (tanned white as  snow), worked with porcupine quills. Also a pair of red leggings worked  with beads. Moccasins worked with colored hair. A fine otter skin robe.  White weasel skins to intertwine with his beautiful long black locks. A  magnificent center eagle feather. A rawhide covered bow, accompanied by  a quiver full of flint arrowheads.    The rabbit, having dressed his son in all the latest finery, sat back  and gazed long and lovingly at his handsome son. Instinctively  Rabbit felt that his son had been sent him for the purpose of being  instrumental in the downfall of Mr. Bear. Events will show.    The morning following the arrival of Rabbit's son, Mr. Bear again  presents himself at the door, crying out: \"You lazy, ugly rabbit, get up  and come out here. I want"]]]
