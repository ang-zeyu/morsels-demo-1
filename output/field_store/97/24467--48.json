Yes, he  surely has the inside edge on me, and if he gets her to throw me  over---- Well, I won't give up without a fight!\" and Tom mentally  girded himself for a battle of wits.    \"He's relying on the prestige he'll get out of this idol of gold if his  party finds it,\" thought on the young inventor.  \"But I'll help find it  first.  I'm glad to have a little start of him, anyhow, even if it  isn't more than two days.  Though if our vessel is held back much by  storms he may get on the ground first.  However, that can't be helped.  I'll do the best I can.\"    These thoughts shot through Tom's mind even as Ned was asking his  questions and making comments.  Then the young inventor, shaking his  shoulders as though to rid them of some weight, remarked:    \"Well, come on out and see the sights.  It will be long before we look  on Broadway again.\"    When the chums returned from their sightseeing excursion, they found  that Professor Bumper had arrived.    \"Where's Professor Bumper?\" asked Ned, the next day.    \"In his room, going over books, papers and maps to make sure he has  everything.\"    \"And Mr. Damon?\"    Tom did not have to answer that last question.  Into the apartment came  bursting the excited individual himself.    \"Bless my overshoes!\" he cried, \"I've been looking everywhere for you!  Come on, there's no time to lose!\"    \"What's the matter now?\" asked Ned.  \"Is the hotel on fire?\"    \"Has anything happened to Professor Bumper?\" Tom demanded, a wild idea  forming in his head that perhaps some one of the Beecher party had  tried to kidnap the discoverer of the lost city of Pelone.    \"Oh, everything is all right,\" answered Mr. Damon.  \"But it's nearly  time for the show to start, and we don't want to be late.  I have  tickets.\"    \"For what?\" asked Tom and Ned together.    \"The movies,\" was the laughing reply.  \"Bless my loose ribs! but I  wouldn't miss him for anything.  He's in a new play called 'Up in a  Balloon Boys.' It's great!\" and Mr. Damon named a certain comic moving  picture star in whose horse-play Mr. Damon took a curious interest.  Tom and Ned were glad enough to go, Tom that he might have a chance to  do a certain amount of thinking, and Ned because he was still boy  enough to like moving pictures.    \"I wonder, Tom,\" said Mr. Damon, as they came out of the theater two  hours later, all three chuckling at the remembrance of what they had  seen, \"I wonder you never turned your inventive mind to the movies.\"    \"Maybe I will, some day,\" said Tom.    He spoke rather uncertainly.  The truth of the matter was that he was  still thinking deeply of the visit of Professor Beecher to Mary Nestor,  and wondering what it portended.    But if Tom's sleep was troubled that night he said nothing of it to his  friends.  He was up early the next morning, for they were to leave that  day, and there was still considerable to be done in seeing that their  baggage and supplies were safely loaded, and in attending to the last  details of some business matters.    While at the hotel they had several glimpses of the members of the  Beecher party who were awaiting the arrival of the young professor who  was to lead them into the wilds of Honduras.  But our friends did not  seek the acquaintance of their rivals.  The latter, likewise, remained  by themselves, though they knew doubtless that there was likely to be a  strenuous race for the possession of the idol of gold, then, it was  presumed, buried deep in some forest-covered city.    Professor Bumper had made his arrangements carefully.  As he explained  to his friends, they would take the steamer from New York to Puerto  Cortes, one of the principal seaports of Honduras.  This is a town of  about three thousand inhabitants, with an excellent harbor and a big  pier along which vessels can tie up and discharge their cargoes  directly into waiting cars.    The preparations were finally completed.  The party went aboard the  steamer, which was a large freight vessel, carrying a limited number of  passengers, and late one afternoon swung down New York Bay.    \"Off for Honduras!\" cried Ned gaily, as they passed the Statue of  Liberty.  \"I wonder what will happen before we see that little lady  again.\"    \"Who knows?\" asked Tom, shrugging his shoulders, Spanish fashion.  And  there came before him the vision of a certain \"little lady,\" about whom  he had been thinking deeply of late.          CHAPTER IX    VAL JACINTO      \"Rather tame, isn't it, Tom?\"    \"Well, Ned, it isn't exactly like going up in an airship,\" and Tom  Swift who was gazing over the rail down into the deep blue water of the  Caribbean Sea, over which their vessel was then steaming, looked at his  chum beside him.    \"No, and your submarine voyage had it all over this one for  excitement,\" went on Ned.  \"When I think of that----\"    \"Bless my sea legs!\" interrupted Mr. Damon, overhearing the  conversation.  \"Don't speak of THAT trip.  My wife never forgave me for  going on it.  But I had a fine time,\" he added with a twinkle of his  eyes.    \"Yes, that was quite a trip,\" observed Tom, as his mind went back to  it.  \"But this one isn't over yet remember.  And I shouldn't be  surprised if we had a little excitement very soon.\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Ned.    Up to this time the voyage from New York down into the tropical seas  had been anything but exciting.  There were not many passengers besides  themselves, and the weather had been fine.    At first, used as they were to the actions of unscrupulous rivals in  trying to thwart their efforts, Tom and Ned had been on the alert for  any signs of hidden enemies on board the steamer.  But aside from a  little curiosity when it became known that they were going to explore  little-known portions of Honduras, the other passengers took hardly any  interest in our travelers.    It was thought best to keep secret the fact that they were going to  search for a wonderful idol of gold.  Not even the mule and ox-cart  drivers, whom they would hire to take them into the wilds of the  interior would be told of the real object of the search.  It would be  given out that they were looking for interesting ruins of ancient  cities, with a view to getting such antiquities as might be there.    \"What do you mean?\" asked Ned again, when Tom did not answer him  immediately.  \"What's the excitement?\"    \"I think we're in for a storm,\" was the reply.  \"The barometer is  falling and I see the crew going about making everything snug.  So we  may have a little trouble toward this end of our trip.\"    \"Let it come!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon.  \"We're not afraid of trouble, Tom  Swift, are we?\"    \"No, to be sure we're not.  And yet it looks as though the storm would  be a bad one.\"    \"Then I am going to see if my books and papers are ready, so I can get  them together in a hurry in case we have to take to the life-boats,\"  said Professor Bumper, coming on deck at that moment.  \"It won't do to  lose them.  If we didn't have the map we might not be able to find----\"    \"Ahem!\" exclaimed Tom, with unnecessary emphasis it seemed.  \"I'll help  you go over your papers, Professor,\" he added, and with a wink and a  motion of his hand, he enjoined silence on his friend.  Ned looked  around for a reason for this, and observed a man, evidently of Spanish  extraction, passing them as he paced up and down the deck.    \"What's the matter?\" asked the scientist in a whisper, as the man went  on.  \"Do you know him?  Is he a----?\"    \"I don't know anything about him,\" said Tom; \"but it is best not to  speak of our trip before strangers.\"    \"You are right, Tom,\" said Professor Bumper.  \"I'll be more careful.\"    A storm was brewing, that was certain.  A dull, sickly yellow began to  obscure the sky, and the water, from a beautiful blue, turned a slate  color and ran along the sides of the vessel with a hissing sound as  though the sullen waves would ask nothing better than to suck the craft  down into their depths.  The wind, which had been freshening, now sang  in louder tones as it hummed through the rigging and the funnel stays  and bowled over the receiving conductors of the wireless.    Sharp commands from the ship's officers hastened the work of the crew  in making things snug, and life lines were strung along deck for the  safety of such of the passengers as might venture up when the blow  began.    The storm was not long in coming.  The howling of the wind grew louder,  flecks of foam began to separate themselves from the crests of the  waves, and the vessel pitched, rolled and tossed more violently.  At  first Tom and his friends thought they were in for no more than an  ordinary blow, but as the storm progressed, and the passengers became  aware of the anxiety on the part of the officers and crew, the alarm  spread among them.    It really was a violent storm, approaching a hurricane in force, and at  one time it seemed as though the craft, having been heeled far over  under a staggering wave that swept her decks, would not come back to an  even keel.    There was a panic among some of the passengers, and a few excited men  behaved in a way that caused prompt action on the part of the first  officer, who drove them back to the main cabin under threat of a  revolver.  For the men were determined to get to the lifeboats, and a  small craft would not have had a minute to live in such seas as were  running.    But the vessel proved herself sturdier than the timid ones had dared to  hope, and she was soon running before the blast, going out of her  course, it is true, but avoiding the danger among the many cays, or  small islands, that dot the Caribbean Sea.    There was nothing to do but to let the storm blow itself out, which it  did in two days.  Then came a period of delightful weather.  The cargo  had shifted somewhat, which gave the steamer a rather undignified list.    This, as well as the loss of a deckhand overboard, was the effect of  the hurricane, and though the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5000"],[0,"The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (#8)"],[1,"ned. If the line _e f_ is to enter as an image into so small  an opening in the eye, you must confess that the smaller object  cannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is  diminished, and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid.    53.    PERSPECTIVE.    Perspective comes in where judgment fails [as to the distance] in  objects which diminish. The eye can never be a true judge for  determining with exactitude how near one object is to another which  is equal to it [in size], if the top of that other is on the level  of the eye which sees them on that side, excepting by means of the  vertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective. Let  _n_ be the eye, _e f_ the vertical plane above mentioned. Let _a b c  d_ be the three divisions, one below the other; if the lines _a n_  and _c n_ are of a given length and the eye _n_ is in the centre,  then _a b_ will look as large as _b c. c d_ is lower and farther off  from _n_, therefore it will look smaller. And the same effect will  appear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter  who is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is  painting.    54.    TO PROVE HOW OBJECTS REACH THE EYE.    If you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut  your eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time.  This is evidence that images enter into the eye.    The relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56).    55.    ELEMENTS OF PERSPECTIVE.    All objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the  nearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will  the image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may  intersect the pyramid with a vertical plane [Footnote 4: _Pariete_.  Compare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer  exclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of  this it should be observed that _c s_ must be regarded as  representing the section or profile of a square plane, placed  horizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word _pianura_  is subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain  preliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the  diagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement.  Leonardo's mistake in writing _t denota_ (line 6) for _f denota_ has  been rectified.] which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown  in the plane _a n_.    The eye _f_ and the eye _t_ are one and the same thing; but the eye  _f_ marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from  the object; and the eye _t_ shows you the direction of it; that is  whether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the  object you are looking at. And remember that the eye _f_ and the eye  _t_ must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise  or lower the eye from the distance point _f_ you must do the same  with the direction point _t_. And if the point _f_ shows how far the  eye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side  it is placed--and, if in the same way, the point _t_ show _s_ the  direction and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must  use both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye  _f_ could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to  the distance between _s_ and _c_, and if at the nearest end of the  side towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight  object, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at _r s_--then, I  say, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is  nearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane _r  s_, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at  the height of the point _n_ on the vertical plane. Thus, by this  example, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of  objects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more  remote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the  eye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which  your feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into  infinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in  itself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which  convey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always  coincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all  we can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as  the diminishing point    [Footnote: The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the  first five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred  to in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to  remark.]    56.    there are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up  to this point. And from the first base where the vertical plane is  placed towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids  without bases; as shown in the example given above. Now, let _a b_  be the said vertical plane and _r_ the point of the pyramid  terminating in the eye, and _n_ the point of diminution which is  always in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the  eye moves--just as when a rod is moved its shadow moves, and moves  with it, precisely as the shadow moves with a body. And each point  is the apex of a pyramid, all having a common base with the  intervening vertical plane. But although their bases are equal their  angles are not equal, because the diminishing point is the  termination of a smaller angle than that of the eye. If you ask me:  \"By what practical experience can you show me these points?\" I  reply--so far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you  --when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows  which come down with their ends to the path where you are walking,  and you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they  tried to get nearer and meet at the [farther] end.    [Footnote: For the easier understanding of the diagram and of its  connection with the preceding I may here remark that the square  plane shown above in profile by the line _c s_ is here indicated by  _e d o p_. According to lines 1, 3 _a b_ must be imagined as a plane  of glass placed perpendicularly at _o p_.]    57.    How to measure the pyramid of vision.    As regards the point in the eye; it is made more intelligible by  this: If you look into the eye of another person you will see your  own image. Now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to  the ears of that image which you see in the other man's eye; you  will understand that these lines converge in such a way that they  would meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in  the eye. And if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in  the air which occupies the space between the object seen and the  eye, you must do it according to the diagram figured below. Let _m  n_ be a tower, and _e f_ a, rod, which you must move backwards and  forwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower [Footnote  9: _I sua stremi .. della storre_ (its ends ... of the tower) this  is the case at _e f_.]; then bring it nearer to the eye, at _c d_  and you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller, as at _r  o_. Then [again] bring it closer to the eye and you will see the rod  project far beyond the image of the tower from _a_ to _b_ and from  _t_ to _b_, and so you will discern that, a little farther within,  the lines must converge in a point.    The Production of pyramid of Vision (58-60).    58.    PERSPECTIVE.    The instant the atmosphere is illuminated it will be filled with an  infinite number of images which are produced by the various bodies  and colours assembled in it. And the eye is the target, a loadstone,  of these images.    59.    The whole surface of opaque bodies displays its whole image in all  the illuminated atmosphere which surrounds them on all sides.    60.    That the atmosphere attracts to itself, like a loadstone, all the  images of the objects that exist in it, and not their forms merely  but their nature may be clearly seen by the sun, which is a hot and  luminous body. All the atmosphere, which is the all-pervading  matter, absorbs light and heat, and reflects in itself the image of  the source of that heat and splendour and, in each minutest portion,  does the same. The Northpole does the same as the loadstone shows;  and the moon and the other planets, without suffering any  diminution, do the same. Among terrestrial things musk does the same  and other perfumes.    61.    All bodies together, and each by itself, give off to the surrounding  air an infinite number of images which are all-pervading and each  complete, each conveying the nature, colour and form of the body  which produces it.    It can clearly be shown that all bodies are, by their images,  all-pervading in the surrounding atmosphere, and each complete in  itself as to substance form and colour; this is seen by the images  of the various bodies which are reproduced in one single perforation  through which they transmit the objects by lines which intersect and  cause reversed pyramids, from the objects, so that they are upside  down on the dark plane where they are first reflected. The reason of  this is--    [Footnote: The diagram intended to illustrate the statement (Pl. II  No. i) occurs in the original between lines 3 and 4. The three  circles must be understood to represent three luminous bodies which  transmit their images through perforations in a wall into a dark  chamber, according to a law which is more fully explained in 75?81.  So far as concerns the present passage the diagram is only intended  to explain that the images of the three bodies may be made to  coalesce at any given spot. In the circles are written,  giallo--yellow, biàcho--white, rosso--red.    The text breaks off at line 8. The paragraph No.40 follows here in  the"]]]
