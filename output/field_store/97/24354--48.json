Our having passed that way  before, when we had scraped acquaintance with the old gentleman, likewise  stood us in good stead. We were most cordially received, and, despite the  lateness of the hour, preparations were at once made to prepare something  for us to eat. Tea, coffee, eggs, fresh butter, and damper were carried  into the sitting-room, and as far as was practicable sleeping quarters  were prepared in the little hut.    The only ill result of our nocturnal fatigues was that we rose late, the  sun being high in the heavens ere we awoke. We were just about to ask for  our driver, when he made his appearance, and told us he was ready to  proceed. He had paid hire for fresh horses at Wulongong, and hoped to make  the rest of the journey without further interruption. While they were  being put to, we re-entered the hut, and now perceived the small space  within which ourselves, three persons, had passed the night on benches,  chairs, and tables. The light of day did not belie the hospitality of our  reception. The furniture was rude but clean. What most surprised us was  the number of massive books which stood on a small shelf, carefully  arranged. They were by much the most valuable part of the furniture, and  the proprietor seemed to be aware of this. The books had been the property  of a schoolmaster, who had exchanged their spiritual contents against  spirits of another nature. The host gave \"tick\" to the schoolmaster, and  thus gradually possessed himself of the entire collection, no  inconsiderable number, of interesting works, which now passed from hand to  hand on holidays or after the day's work was over; the desire for  knowledge of the settlers in this primitive Australian forest thus finding  ample room to expand itself in many useful and learned particulars of  foreign lands and peoples.    Towards 1 P.M. we reached Campbelton. At the hotel where we alighted was  installed a lodge of Odd Fellows, newly instituted. The first visible  result of its organization was almost universal intoxication! In the  streets and the public-houses, everywhere crowds of drunken men were  staggering about. Every third house in Campbelton is a whisky shop!  Throughout the colony the consumption of ardent spirits has reached an  alarming height, being estimated at L6 per head of the entire population  annually! Besides the spirits manufactured in the colony itself, New South  Wales imports annually L1,000,000 of wine, beer, brandy, and other  descriptions of liquor; a greater consumption of spirits than in any  other country of the globe![17]    The rest of our return journey being by rail was performed in two hours.  The telegraph is in full activity between Campbelton and Sydney, the  charge for a message of ten words being two shillings, and two-pence for  each succeeding word. Towards 6 P.M. we reached Sydney, driving in the  present instance to the Australian club, where accommodation had in the  kindest manner been provided for us.    While one section of our staff had been making the excursion southwards  which we have just described, among the forests and barrens of the  Illawara district, another party visited the sources of Hunter River and  the Newcastle coal-fields, whence they returned laden with botanical,  mineralogical, entomological, and palaeontological collections, samples of  coal, fossil plants, and specimens of the Silurian formations.    The most interesting episode in their excursion was their stay on Ash  Island, a small isle in the Hunter River, the property of A. W. Scott,  Esq., M.L.A., who has settled there with his family. Two of his daughters  are hardly more conspicuous by their loveliness and grace than by their  profound acquaintance with entomology, which they pursue with the utmost  zeal. In addition to geological and conchyliological collections, they  have also a carefully classed collection of insects and butterflies, and  at the time of our visit were about publishing a large work upon  Australian butterflies. They also have the lepidopterous _fauna_ of New  South Wales in great variety and in every stage of metamorphosis, in many  cases from the very _ovum_, all copiously explained, and their  distinguishing characteristics placed beneath in a series of above one  hundred tables, which the two ladies, who are accomplished artists both in  drawing and painting, have themselves lithographed and coloured.    An excursion was also made from Ash Island to the Sugar Loaf, 3288 feet  high, the loftiest mountain in the district. As they had to do 40 miles in  one day, the party sprang to their horses as soon as day dawned, and,  accompanied by two settlers of Ash Island, laid themselves out for the  day's work. First they ascended Hunter River for about a couple of miles,  which a little further on headed to the northward, while the cavalcade  kept to the left towards the hills. The forest was so clear of underwood,  that one could almost ride along as though in a park. Despite the numerous  traces of extensive fires, it seemed to have been but little altered by  these from its primitive wildness. Occasionally huts and cultivated land  were passed; the great proprietors usually give these runs to be  cultivated as farms, or make them serve for their cattle, under their own  drovers. In winter the cattle run at will in the \"Bush,\" as the settlers  call this characteristic scenery, wherever they can find the best pasture  for themselves. In summer again, when the great heat dries everything up,  they are foddered with hay under shelter. The sunny forest consists of  _Eucalypti_, _Melaleuca_, and other _myrtaceae_, splendid _casuarinas_,  _Grevilleae_, _Banksiae_, the native pear (_Hylomelum_), the highly prized  Warratah (_Telopea speciosissima_), the all but shadowless _Acacia_, the  indigenous cherry (_Exocarpus_), beautiful _Papilionaceae_, and very  peculiar _Stylidiae_, &c. All these were old acquaintances however of the  Austrian naturalists, who greeted them in this their native soil with  redoubled interest and astonishment. Covered with blossoms they grew in  wild unchecked profusion all around their path, so that the very horses  frequently trod them under foot, scenting the air with an aroma which in  Europe can only be obtained by lavish expenditure. Numerous birds, chiefly  parrots, circled round the tops of the trees; the crow-like _Strepera  graculina_, the bald-headed _Tropidorhynchus corniculatus_ the \"Jack ass\"  (_Dacela gigantea_), so highly regarded and carefully tended by the  colonists on account of its admonishing them of the presence of poisonous  serpents, quantities of chaffinches (_frigellidae_), the fan-tailed  flycatcher (_Muscipiada_), the _Climacteris_, which runs up and down the  trunks of the trees like our own wood-pecker, the monitor lizard, four or  five feet in length, which flits rapidly to and fro among the trees, the  prickly chameleon, and beautiful specimens of fossil helix, all furnished  a rich reward for the zoologist.    After a ride of three hours the party began to approach a steep wall of  rock, where the horses were left, as they had now to prosecute their  journey on foot, till at length they came to a confused mass of coarse,  breccia-like sandstone, constituting what is known as the Sugar Loaf,  whence they had to toil laboriously among the rocks till they reached the  summit. A marvellous panorama was spread out before them; the whole county  of Northumberland, with its green forest clothing, was stretched out at  their feet in all its sunlit splendour. To the left far in the distance  was visible the township of Maitland, and the navigable part of the Hunter  River, which wound along like a silver band till it was lost in the  distance, where it fell into the Pacific, on whose seething billows the  stately ships looked like small white specks on a confused, uncertain  back-ground. Far in the distance to the right, half concealed by the  forest, was Lake Macquarie. The colonial members of the party described  the latter as very difficult of access, but as a veritable paradise for  the sportsman, since it is frequented by black swans in hundreds, the  Australian stork, curlews, the hook-billed creeper, cormorants, and an  infinite variety of water-fowl. The Blue Mountains formed the back-ground  of this splendid landscape. The whole neighbourhood is pretty well settled  and cultivated. Here and there wreaths of blue smoke indicated where the  huts of industrious colonists lay concealed in the forest. Their  conductors were not a whit behind the strangers in their appreciation of  the panoramic effect; they had never scaled the summit before, although  the elder had lived 15 years at Ash Island, and had often been as far as  the top of the first rocky ascent in search of strayed cattle.    Lost in delighted contemplation of the beauties of nature, no account was  made of the passage of time, so that part of the return journey had to be  made in the twilight. It was a delightful, clear, moonlight night. The  deep stillness in nature was only occasionally broken by the shrill cry of  the curlew (_Numenius arquata_), from the neighbouring swamps, or the  rustling of Wallabies disturbed by the tread of the advancing horsemen.  Buried in a sort of dreamy charm that could find no utterance, the riders  left their horses to choose their own pace over the sward, hardly able to  realize that they were indeed under the unclouded brilliancy of an  Australian sky, traversing the forests haunted by the timid kangaroo and  the swift but shy emu.    Unfortunately it was found impossible, owing to want of time, to visit the  Blue Mountains and the gold regions around Bathurst. We had to content our  curiosity as to the products of the gold-fields by examining the nuggets  exhibited by the fortunate finders in the jewellers' shops of George  Street, Sydney, and the particulars furnished in the daily papers of the  well-authen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38480"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.—No. 24. [New Series.], December 14, 1878 (#8)"],[1,"copy on the first attempt. The public knowledge of such a  means of forging would, at that time, have shattered the whole system  of the British Stamp Office, had a knowledge of the method been  allowed to escape. The secret has, however, been carefully guarded to  this day.    During the time that Mr. Bessemer was engaged in studying this  question he was informed that the government were themselves cognizant  of the fact that they were losers to a great amount annually by  the transfer of stamps from old and useless deeds to new skins of  parchment, thus making the stamps do duty a second or third time, to  the serious loss of the revenue. One official in high position said  that he believed they were defrauded in this way to the extent of  probably L100,000 per annum. To fully appreciate the importance of  this fact, and realize the facility afforded for this species of fraud  by the system then in use, it must be understood that the ordinary  impressed or embossed stamp, such as is employed on all bills of  exchange, if impressed directly on a skin of parchment, would be  entirely obliterated by exposing the deed for a few months to a damp  atmosphere. The deed would thus appear as if unstamped, and therefore  invalid. To prevent this it has been the practice as far back as  the reign of Queen Anne to gum a small piece of blue paper on to the  parchment; and for still greater security a strip of metal foil is  passed through it, and another small piece of paper with the printed  initials of the Sovereign is gummed over the loose ends of the foil at  the back. The stamp is then impressed on the blue paper, which, unlike  parchment, is incapable of losing the impression by exposure to a damp  atmosphere. But, practically, it has been found that a little piece of  moistened blotting paper applied for a whole night so softens the gum  that the two pieces of paper and the slip of foil can be removed from  the old deed most easily, and be applied to a new skin of parchment,  and thus be made to do duty a second or third time. Thus the expensive  stamps on thousands of old deeds of partnership, leases, and other old  documents, when no longer of value, offer a rich harvest to those who  are dishonest enough to use them. A knowledge of these facts led Mr.  Bessemer to fully appreciate the importance of any system of stamps  that would effectually prevent so great a loss; nor did he for one  moment doubt but that government would amply reward success. After  some months of study and experiment, which he cheerfully undertook  (although it interfered considerably with the pursuit of regular  business, inasmuch as it was necessary to carry on the experiments  with the strictest secrecy, and to do all the work himself during the  night after his people had left work), he succeeded in making a stamp  that satisfied all the necessary conditions. It was impossible to  remove it from one deed and transfer it to another. No amount of  damp, or even saturation with water, could obliterate it, and it  was impossible to take any impression from it capable of producing a  duplicate.    Mr. Bessemer says that he knew nothing of patents or patent law in  those days; and adds that if he had for a moment thought it necessary  to make any preliminary conditions with government he would have at  once scouted the idea as utterly unworthy, thinking his interests  absolutely secure. In this full confidence he sought an interview with  the then chief of the Stamp Office, Sir Charles Presley, and showed  him by numerous proofs how easily all his stamps could be forged, and  also the mode of prevention. He was greatly astonished, and at a later  interview he suggested that the principle of the invention should be  worked out fully. This Mr. Bessemer was only too anxious to do; and  some five or six weeks later called again with a newly designed stamp,  which greatly pleased him. The design was circular, about 21/2 inches  in diameter, and consisted of the Garter with the motto in capital  letters surmounted by a crown. Within the Garter was a shield with the  words \"five pounds.\" The space between the shield and the Garter was  filled with network in imitation of lace. The die had been executed in  steel, which pierced the parchment with more than 400 holes, each one  of the necessary form to produce its special portion of the design.  Since that period perforated paper of this kind has been largely  employed for valentines and other ornamental purposes, but was  previously unknown. It was at once obvious that the transfer of such  a stamp was impossible. It was equally clear that dampness could not  obliterate it; nor was it possible to take any impression from it  capable of perforating another skin of parchment.    This design gave great satisfaction, and everything went on smoothly;  Sir Charles consulted Lord Althorp, and the Stamp Office authorities  determined to adopt it. Mr. Bessemer was then asked if, instead of  receiving a sum of money from the Treasury, he would be satisfied with  the position of Superintendent of Stamps, at some L600 or L800 per  annum. This was all that he then desired, rejoicing over the prospect,  for he was at that time engaged to be married, and his future position  in life seemed assured. An incident now occurred that reads almost  like romance. A few days after affairs had assumed this satisfactory  position, he called on the young lady to whom he was then engaged  (now Mrs. Bessemer), and showed her the pretty piece of network which  constituted the new parchment stamp, explaining how it could never  be removed from the parchment and used again, and mentioning the fact  that old deeds with stamps on them dated as far back as the reign  of Queen Anne could be fraudulently used. She at once said, \"Yes, I  understand this; but surely, if all stamps had a date put upon them,  they could not at a future time be used again without detection?\" This  was indeed a new light, and greatly startled the inventor, who at once  said that steel dies used for this purpose could have but one date  engraved upon them. But after a little consideration he saw that  movable dates were by no means impossible, and that this could easily  be effected by drilling three holes of about a quarter of an inch in  diameter in the steel die, and fitting into each of these openings a  steel plug or type with sunk figures engraved on their ends, giving on  one the date of the month, on the next the month of the year, and on  the third circular steel type the last two figures of the year. This  plan would be most simple and efficient, would take less time and  money to inaugurate than the more elaborate plan that had been  devised; but while pleased and proud at the clever and simple  suggestion of the young lady, her future husband saw also that all his  more elaborate system of piercing dies, the result of months of study,  and the toil of many a weary and lonely night, was shattered to pieces  by it. He feared to disturb the decision that Sir Charles Presley  had come to, as to the adoption of the perforated stamp, but, with  a strong conviction of the advantages of the new plan, felt in honor  bound not to suppress it, whatever might be the result. Thus it was  that he soon found himself again closeted with Sir Charles at Somerset  House, discussing the new scheme, which he much preferred, because,  as he said, all the old dies, old presses, and old workmen could  be employed, and there would be but little change in the office--so  little, in fact, that no new superintendent of stamps was required,  which the then unknown art of making and using piercing dies would  have rendered absolutely necessary. After due consideration the first  plan was definitely abandoned by the office in favor of the dated  stamps, with which every one is now familiar. In six or eight weeks  from this time an Act of Parliament was passed calling in the private  stock of stamps dispersed throughout the country, and authorizing the  issue of the new dated ones.    Thus was inaugurated a system that has been in operation some  forty-five years, successfully preventing that source of fraud from  which the revenue had so severely suffered. If anything like Sir  Charles Presley's estimate of L100,000 per annum was correct, this  saving must now amount to some millions sterling; but whatever the  varying amount might have been, it is certain that so important and  long established a system as that in use at the Stamp Office would  never have been voluntarily broken up by its own officials, except  under the strongest conviction that the losses were very great, and  that the new order of things would prove an effectual barrier to  future fraud. During all the bustle of this great change no steps had  been taken to install the inventor in the office. Lord Althorp had  resigned, and no one seemed to have authority to do anything. All  sorts of half promises and excuses followed each other, with long  delays between, and Mr. Bessemer gradually saw the whole thing sliding  out of his grasp. Instead of holding fast to the first plan, which  they could not have executed without his aid and special knowledge,  he had, in all the trustfulness of youthful inexperience, shown them  another plan, so simple that they could put it in operation without  any assistance. He had no patent to fall back upon, and could not go  to law, even if he wished to do so, for he was reminded, when  pressing for mere money out of pocket, that he had done all the work  voluntarily. Wearied and disgusted, he at last ceased to waste time  in calling at the Stamp Office, and he felt that nothing but increased  exertions could make up for the loss of some nine months of toil and  expenditure. Thus, sad and dispirited, and with a burning sense of  injustice overpowering all other feelings, he went from the Stamp  Office, too proud to ask as a favor that which was indubitably his  just"]]]
