IN BRITTANY    As was pointed out at the beginning of this chapter, Ireland and  Brittany are to be regarded as the two poles of the modern Celtic world,  but it is believed by Celtic mystics that they are much more than this,  that they are two of its psychic centres, with Tara and Carnac as two  respective points of focus from which the Celtic influence of each  country radiates.[9] With such a psychical point of view, it makes no  difference at all whether one scholar argues Carnac to be Celtic and  another pre-Celtic, for if pre-Celtic, as it most likely is, it has  certainly been bequeathed to the people who were and are Celtic, and its  influence has been an unbroken thing from times altogether beyond the  horizon of history. According to this theory (and in following it we  are merely trying to put on record unique material transmitted to us by  the most learned of contemporary Celtic mystics and seers) there seem to  be certain favoured places on the earth where its magnetic and even more  subtle forces are most powerful and most easily felt by persons  susceptible to such things; and Carnac appears to be one of the greatest  of such places in Europe, and for this reason, as has been thought, was  probably selected by its ancient priest-builders as the great centre for  religious practices, for the celebration of pagan mysteries, for tribal  assemblies, for astronomical observations, and very likely for  establishing schools in which to educate neophytes for the priesthood.  Tara, with its tributary Boyne valley, is a similar place in Ireland, so  selected and so used, as, in our study of the cult of fairies and the  cult of the dead, manuscript evidence will later indicate. And thus to  such psychical and magnetic, or, according perhaps to others, religious  or traditional influences as focus themselves at Tara and Carnac, though  in other parts of the two countries as well, may be due in a great, even  in an essential measure, the vigorous and ever-living Fairy-Faith of  Ireland, and the innate and ever-conscious belief of the Breton people  in the Legend of the Dead and in a world invisible. For fairies and  souls of the dead, though, strictly speaking, not confused, are believed  to be beings of the subjective world existing to-day, and influencing  mortals, as they have always existed and influenced them according to  ancient and modern traditions, and as they appear now in the eyes even  of science through the work of a few pioneer scientists in psychical  research. And it seems probable that subjective beings of this kind,  granting their existence, were made use of by the ancient Druids, and  even by Patrick when the old and new religions met to do battle on the  Hill of Tara. The control of Tara, as a psychical centre, meant the  psychical control of all Ireland. To-day on the Hill of Tara the statue  of St. Patrick dwarfs the Liath Stone beside it; at Carnac the Christian  Cross overshadows dolmens and menhirs.    A learned priest of the Roman Church told me, when I met him in Galway,  that in his opinion those places in Ireland where ancient sacrifices  were performed to pagan or Druid gods are still, unless they have been  regularly exorcized, under the control of demons (daemons). And what the  Druids were at Tara and throughout Erin and most probably at Carnac as  well, the priests were in Egypt, and the pythonesses in Greece. That is  to say, Druids, Egyptian priests, priestesses in charge of Greek  oracles, are said to have foretold the future, interpreted omens, worked  all miracles and wonders of magic by the aid of daemons, who were  regarded as an order of invisible beings, intermediary between gods and  men, and as sometimes including the shades from Hades.    I should say as before, if he who knowing Ireland, the Land of Faerie,  would know in the same manner Brittany, the Land of the Dead, let him  silently and alone walk many times--in sun, in wind, in storm, in thick  mist--through the long, broad avenues of stone of the Alignements at  Carnac. Let him watch from among them the course of the sun from east to  west. Let him stand on St. Michael's Mount on the day of the winter  solstice, or on the day of the summer solstice. Let him enter the  silence of its ancient underground chamber, so dark and so mysterious.  Let him sit for hours musing amid cromlechs and dolmens, and beside  menhirs, and at holy wells. Let him marvel at the mightiest of menhirs  now broken and prostrate at Locmariaquer, and then let him ponder over  the subterranean places near it. Let him try to read the symbolic  inscriptions on the rocks in Gavrinis. Let him stand on the Ile de Sein  at sunrise and at sunset. Let him penetrate the solitudes of the Forest  of Broceliande, and walk through the Val-Sans-Retour (Vale-Without-Return).  And then let him wander in footpaths with the Breton peasant through  fields where good dames sit on the sunny side of a bush or wall,  knitting stockings, where there are long hedges of furze, golden-yellow  with bloom--even in January--and listen to stories about _corrigans_,  and about the dead who mingle here with the living. Let him enter the  peasant's cottage when there is fog over the land and the sea-winds are  blowing across the shifting sand-dunes, and hear what he can tell him.  Let him, even as he enjoys the picturesque customs and dress of the  Breton folk and looks on at their joyous _ronde_ (perhaps the relic of a  long-forgotten sun-dance), observe the depth of their nature, their  almost ever-present sense of the seriousness of human life and effort,  their beautiful characters as their mystic land has shaped them without  the artificiality of books and schools, their dreaminess as they look  out across the ocean, their often perfect physique and fine profiles and  rosy cheeks, and yet withal their brooding innate melancholy. And let  him know that there is with them always an overshadowing consciousness  of an invisible world, not in some distant realm of space, but here and  now, blending itself with this world; its inhabitants, their dead  ancestors and friends, mingling with them daily, and awaiting the hour  when the _Ankou_ (a King of the Dead) shall call each to join their  invisible company.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION    Various possible plans have presented themselves for setting forth the  living Fairy-Faith as I have found it during my travels in the six  Celtic countries among the people who hold it. To take a bit here and a  bit there from a miscellaneous group of psychological experiences, fairy  legends and stories which are linked together almost inseparably in the  mind of the one who tells them, does not seem at all satisfactory, nor  even just, in trying to arrive at a correct result. Classification under  various headings, such, for example, as Fairy Abductions, Changelings,  or Appearances of Fairies, seems equally unsatisfactory; for as soon as  the details of folk-lore such as I am presenting are isolated from one  another--even though brought together in related groups--they must be  rudely torn out of their true and natural environment, and divorced from  the psychological atmosphere amidst which they were first presented by  the narrator. The same objection applies to any plan of dividing the  evidence into (1) that which is purely legendary; (2) that which is  second-hand or third-hand evidence from people who claim to have seen  fairies, or to have been in Fairyland or under fairy influences; and (3)  that which is first-hand evidence from actual percipients: these three  classes of evidence are so self-evident that every reader will be able  to distinguish each class for himself as it occurs, and a mechanical  classification by us is unnecessary. So no plan seems so good as the  plan I have adopted of permitting all witnesses to give their own  testimony in their own way and in its native setting, and then of  classifying and weighing such testimony according to the methods of  comparative religion and the anthropological sciences.    In most cases, as examination will show, the evidence is so clear that  little or no comment is necessary. Most of the evidence also points so  much in one direction that the only verdict which seems reasonable is  that the Fairy-Faith belongs to a doctrine of souls; that is to say,  that Fairyland is a state or condition, realm or place, very much like,  if not the same as, that wherein civilized and uncivilized men alike  place the souls of the dead, in company with other invisible beings such  as gods, daemons, and all sorts of good and bad spirits. Not only do  both educated and uneducated Celtic seers so conceive Fairyland, but  they go much further, and say that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34856"],[0,"My Own Story (#8)"],[1,"ill. We interviewed every one of the members  who had pledged themselves to support a suffrage bill when it should be  introduced, but we found not one single member who would agree that his  chance in the ballot, if he drew such a chance, should be given to  introducing the bill. Every man had some other measure he was anxious to  further. Mr. Keir Hardie had previously given us his pledge, but his  name, as we had feared, was not drawn in the ballot. We next set out to  interview all the men whose names had been drawn, and we finally induced  Mr. Bamford Slack, who held the fourteenth place, to introduce our bill.  The fourteenth place was not a good one, but it served, and the second  reading of our bill was set down for Friday, May 12th, the second order  of the day.    This being the first suffrage bill in eight years, a thrill of  excitement animated not only our ranks but all the old suffrage  societies. Meetings were held, and a large number of petitions  circulated. When the day came for consideration on our bill, the  Strangers' Lobby could not hold the enormous gathering of women of all  classes, rich and poor, who flocked to the House of Commons. It was  pitiful to see the look of hope and joy that shone on the faces of many  of these women. We knew that our poor little measure had the very  slightest chance of being passed. The bill that occupied the first order  of the day was one providing that carts travelling along public roads at  night should carry a light behind as well as before. We had tried to  induce the promoters of this unimportant little measure to withdraw it  in the interests of our bill, but they refused. We had tried also to  persuade the Conservative Government to give our bill facilities for  full discussion, but they also refused. So, as we fully anticipated,  the promoters of the Roadway Lighting Bill were allowed to \"talk out\"  our bill. They did this by spinning out the debate with silly stories  and foolish jokes. The members listened to the insulting performance  with laughter and applause.    When news of what was happening reached the women who waited in the  Strangers' Lobby, a feeling of wild excitement and indignation took  possession of the throng. Seeing their temper, I felt that the moment  had come for a demonstration such as no old-fashioned suffragist had  ever attempted. I called upon the women to follow me outside for a  meeting of protest against the government. We swarmed out into the open,  and Mrs. Wolstenholm-Elmy, one of the oldest suffrage workers in  England, began to speak. Instantly the police rushed into the crowd of  women, pushing them about and ordering them to disperse. We moved on as  far as the great statue of Richard Coeur de Lion that guards the  entrance to the House of Lords, but again the police intervened. Finally  the police agreed to let us hold a meeting in Broad Sanctuary, very near  the gates of Westminster Abbey. Here we made speeches and adopted a  resolution condemning the Government's action in allowing a small  minority to talk out our bill. This was the first militant act of the  W. S. P. U. It caused comment and even some alarm, but the police  contented themselves with taking our names.    The ensuing summer was spent in outdoor work. By this time the Women's  Social and Political Union had acquired some valuable accessions, and  money began to come to us. Among our new members was one who was  destined to play an important role in the unfolding drama of the  militant movement. At the close of one of our meetings at Oldham a young  girl introduced herself to me as Annie Kenney, a mill-worker, and a  strong suffrage sympathiser. She wanted to know more of our society and  its objects, and I invited her and her sister Jenny, a Board School  teacher, to tea the next day. They came and joined our Union, a step  that definitely changed the whole course of Miss Kenney's life, and gave  us one of our most distinguished leaders and organisers. With her help  we began to carry our propaganda to an entirely new public.    In Lancashire there is an institution known as the Wakes, a sort of  travelling fair where they have merry-go-rounds, Aunt-Sallies, and other  festive games, side-shows of various kinds, and booths where all kinds  of things are sold. Every little village has its Wakes-week during the  summer and autumn, and it is the custom for the inhabitants of the  villages to spend the Sunday before the opening of the Wakes walking  among the booths in anticipation of tomorrow's joys. On these occasions  the Salvation Army, temperance orators, venders of quack medicines,  pedlars, and others, take advantage of the ready-made audience to  advance their propaganda. At Annie Kenney's suggestion we went from one  village to the other, following the Wakes and making suffrage speeches.  We soon rivalled in popularity the Salvation Army, and even the  tooth-drawers and patent-medicine pedlars.    The Women's Social and Political Union had been in existence two years  before any opportunity was presented for work on a national scale. The  autumn of 1905 brought a political situation which seemed to us to  promise bright hopes for women's enfranchisement. The life of the old  Parliament, dominated for nearly twenty years by the Conservative Party,  was drawing to an end, and the country was on the eve of a general  election in which the Liberals hoped to be returned to power. Quite  naturally the Liberal candidates went to the country with perfervid  promises of reform in every possible direction. They appealed to the  voters to return them, as advocates and upholders of true democracy, and  they promised that there should be a Government united in favour of  people's rights against the powers of a privileged aristocracy.    Now repeated experiences had taught us that the only way to attain  women's suffrage was to commit a Government to it. In other words,  pledges of support from candidates were plainly useless. They were not  worth having. The only object worth trying for was pledges from  responsible leaders that the new Government would make women's suffrage  a part of the official programme. We determined to address ourselves to  those men who were likely to be in the Liberal Cabinet, demanding to  know whether their reforms were going to include justice to women.    We laid our plans to begin this work at a great meeting to be held in  Free Trade Hall, Manchester, with Sir Edward Grey as the principal  speaker. We intended to get seats in the gallery, directly facing the  platform and we made for the occasion a large banner with the words:  \"Will the Liberal Party Give Votes for Women?\" We were to let this  banner down over the gallery rails at the moment when our speaker rose  to put the question to Sir Edward Grey. At the last moment, however, we  had to alter the plan because it was impossible to get the gallery seats  we wanted. There was no way in which we could use our large banner, so,  late in the afternoon on the day of the meeting, we cut out and made a  small banner with the three-word inscription: \"Votes for Women.\" Thus,  quite accidentally, there came into existence the present slogan of the  suffrage movement around the world.    Annie Kenney and my daughter Christabel were charged with the mission of  questioning Sir Edward Grey. They sat quietly through the meeting, at  the close of which questions were invited. Several questions were asked  by men and were courteously answered. Then Annie Kenney arose and asked:  \"If the Liberal party is returned to power, will they take steps to give  votes for women?\" At the same time Christabel held aloft the little  banner that every one in the hall might understand the nature of the  question. Sir Edward Grey returned no answer to Annie's question, and  the men sitting near her forced her rudely into her seat, while a  steward of the meeting pressed his hat over her face. A babel of  shouts, cries and catcalls sounded from all over the hall.    As soon as order was restored Christabel stood up and repeated the  question: \"Will the Liberal Government, if returned, give votes to  women?\" Again Sir Edward Grey ignored the question, and again a perfect  tumult of shouts and angry cries arose. Mr. William Peacock, chief  constable of Manchester, left the platform and came down to the women,  asking them to write their question, which he promised to hand to the  speaker. They wrote: \"Will the Liberal Government give votes to  working-women? Signed, on behalf of the Women's Social and Political  Union, Annie Kenney, member of the Oldham committee of the card-and  blowing-room operatives.\" They added a line to say that, as one of  96,000 organised women textile-workers, Annie Kenney earnestly desired  an answer to the question.    Mr. Peacock kept his word and handed the question to Sir Edward Grey,  who read it, smiled, and passed it to the others on the platform. They  also read it with smiles, but no answer to the question was made. Only  one lady who was sitting on the platform tried to say something, but the  chairman interrupted by asking Lord Durham to move a vote of thanks to  the speaker. Mr. Winston Churchill seconded the motion, Sir Edward Grey  replied briefly, and the meeting began to break up. Annie Kenney stood  up in her chair and cried out over the noise of shuffling feet and  murmurs of conversation: \"Will the Liberal Government give votes to  women?\" Then the audience became a mob. They howled, they shouted and  roared, shaking their fists fiercely at the woman who dared to intrude  her question into a man's meeting. Hands were lifted to drag her out of  her chair, but Christabel threw one arm about her as she stood, and with  the other arm warded off the mob, who struck and scratched at her until  her sleeve was red with blood. Still the girls held together and shouted  over and over: \"The question! The question! Answer the question!\"    Six men, stewards of"]]]
