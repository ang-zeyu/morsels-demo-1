[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4294"],[0,"Tales of Aztlan; The Romance of a Hero of Our Late Spanish-American War, (#8)"],[1," a captain, a man of courage and experience. The  captain's first official act was to place a guard of four armed men  over the Navajo to prevent his escape, otherwise they treated their  prisoner well.    The women of the town cooked and baked for the party, and undoubtedly  each lady reveled in the hope to see her own man return with a sackful  of gold; and as a result of these fanciful expectations they were in  the best of spirits, laughing and singing the livelong day.    At last the party was off, and what happened to them I shall relate, as  told me by the captain, Don Jose Marie Baca y Artiaga, and in his own  words as nearly as I can remember them. \"Valga me, Dios, Senor! What an  experience was that trip to Arizona! It began and ended with  disappointment and disaster. All the men of our party seemed to have  lost their wits from the greed of gold. They began by hurrying. Those  who had the best mounts rushed on ahead, carrying the Indian along with  them, and strove to leave their companions who were not so well mounted  behind. The first night's camp had of necessity to be made at a point  on the Rio Puerco, distant about thirty-five miles. As the last men  rode into camp, the first comers were already making ready to leave  again. In vain I remonstrated and commanded. There was a fight, and not  until several men were seriously wounded came they to their senses and  obeyed my orders. I threatened to leave them and return home, for I  knew very well that unless our party kept together we were sure to be  ambushed and attacked. I cautioned my companions as they valued their  lives to watch the Navajo and shoot him on the spot at the first sign  of treachery. This devil of an Indian led us over terrible trails,  across the roughest and highest peaks and the deepest canyons of a  wild, broken country. He seemed to be on the lookout ever for an  opportunity to escape, but I did not give him the chance. Our horses  suffered and were well-nigh exhausted when we finally sighted the  coveted stream from a spur of the Mogollon range which we were then  descending. The stream glistened and shone like gold in the distance,  under the hot rays of a noonday sun and my companions would have made a  dash for the coveted goal if their horses had not been utterly  exhausted and footsore. As it was, I had the greatest trouble to calm  them. Arriving at the last and steepest declivity of the trail, I  succeeded in halting the party long enough to listen to my words.  'Companions,' I said, 'hear me before you rush on! I shall stay here  with this Indian, whom you will first tie to this mesquite tree. Now  you may go, and may the saints deliver you from your evil passion and  folly. Mind you, senores, I claim an equal share with you in whatever  gold you may find. If any one objects, let him come forth and say so  now, man to man. I shall hold the trail for those among you who would  haply choose to return. Forsooth, companions, I like not the actions of  this Indian. Beware the Apache, senores; remember we are in the Tonto's  own country!'    \"From my position I witnessed the exciting race to the banks of the  stream, and saw plainly how eagerly my companions worked with pick and  pan. Hard they worked, but not long, for soon they assembled in the  shade of a tree, and after a conference I saw them make the usual  preparations for camping. Several men looked after the wants of the  horses, others built fires, and four of the party returned toward me.  'What luck, Companeros!' I hailed them when they came within hearing  distance. 'Senor Capitan, we have come for the Indian,' said the  spokesman of the squad. 'And what use have you for the Indian?' I  asked. 'We shall hang him to yonder tree,' they said, 'as a warning to  liars and impostors.' Bueno, Caballeros, he deserves it. I deliver him  into your hands under this condition, that you grant him a fair trial,  as becomes men who being good Catholics and sure of the salvation of  their souls may not, without just cause, consign a heathen to the  everlasting fires of perdition.'    \"Silently, stoically, the Indian suffered himself to be led to the  place of his execution. After the enraged Mexicans had placed him under  a tree with the noose of a riata around his neck, they informed him  that he might now plead in the defense of his life if he had anything  to say. 'Mexicans,' said the Navajo, 'I fear not death! If I must die,  let it be by a bullet. I call the great Spirit, who knows the hearts of  his people, to witness that I beg not for my life. I have not a split  tongue nor am I an impostor. I have guided you to the place of gold. I  have kept my promise. You Mexicans came with evil hearts. You fought  your own brothers. You abandoned your sick companions on the trail to  the coyote. You have broken the law of hospitality toward me, your  guest, as no Spaniard has ever done before. Therefore, has your God  punished you. He has changed the good gold of these waters to  shimmering mica and shining dross. Fool gold He gives to fools! As you  serve me now, so shall the Apaches do to you. Never more shall you  taste of the waters of the Rio Grande, so says the Spirit in my heart!'    \"The Indian's dignified bearing and his inspired words on the threshold  of eternity moved my conscience and caused a feeling of respect and  pity for him in my breast as well as in others of our party. When Juan  de Dios Carasco, who was known and despised by all for being a  good-for-nothing thieving coward, drew his gun to shoot the Navajo in  the back, I could not control my anger. 'Stop,' I shouted, 'you  miserable hen thief, or you die at my hands, and now. This Indian  should die, but not in such a manner. Senores, you have made me your  capitan. Now I shall enforce my orders at the risk of my life's blood.  Give that Indian a knife and fair play in a combat against the prowess  of the valiant Don Juan de Dios Carasco.'    \"Although greatly disconcerted, Juan de Dios had to toe the mark. There  was no alternative for him now, as I was desperate and my orders were  obeyed to the letter, for death was the penalty for disobedience. The  fight between the Mexican and the Indian ended by the Navajo, who was  sorely wounded, throwing his knife into the heart of his enemy. It was  a fair fight, although we accorded Juan de Dios, he being a Christian,  this advantage against the Indian (who was better skilled in the use of  weapons) that we allowed him to wrap his coat about his left arm as a  shield, while the Indian was stripped to his patarague, or breechclout.  We buried the body and allowed the Indian to shift for himself. I  observed him crawling near the water's edge in quest of herbs, which he  masticated and applied to his wounds with an outer coating of mud from  the banks of the stream. During the following night he disappeared. I  suspect that the golden nuggets which caused all our troubles were  taken from the body of a prospector who had been murdered in the  lonesome mountains of Arizona.    \"We allowed our horses several days' rest to recuperate before starting  on our return trip. You saw, senor, how we arrived. Starved, sore, and  discouraged, we straggled home, jeered at and ridiculed by wiseacres  who are always ready to say, 'I told you so!' and by enemies who had no  liking for us. But the women, may Santa Barbara keep them virtuous!  they who loved their husbands truly rejoiced to welcome us home,  although we failed to bring them chispas de oro.    \"As concerns the wife of Juan de Dios, and who was now his widow,  pobrecita, she was not to be found at her home. She had taken advantage  of her man's absence to decamp to the mountain of Manzana with a  strapping goat-herder, a very worthy young man, whom she loved and is  now happily free to marry.\"          CHAPTER VII.    THE FIGHT IN THE SAND HILLS. THE PHANTOM DOG      A number of years had I lived with my relatives when uncle found it  expedient to sell out his business. He had prospered wonderfully in his  commercial ventures. Long since had his coffers absorbed most of the  money circulating within his sphere of trade. Thereafter he accepted  commercial paper in payment for merchandise, and trade grew immensely.  Our customers soon learned how easy it was to affix their signatures to  promissory notes and to mortgages on their lands or cattle, their  horses, sheep, crops, and chattels. Of course there was a little  interest to be paid on the indebtedness, but as it was merely a  trifling one and a half per centum per month or eighteen per cent  yearly, it was of no consequence. And it was so easy to pay your debts.  Just think of it, people bought everything they needed and longed for  at the store and paid for it by simply signing their names to several  papers. When the day of payment came, they could liquidate their debts  by renewing their obligations. They simply signed a new set of similar  papers with the interest compounded and added to the original debt.  Surely Don Guillermo was conceded to stand highest in popular  estimation of any set of men who had ever come to the Rio Grande. Had  he not shown the people how to do business in a convenient and easy  manner? Under such a system nobody worried or labored very much and  life was like a pleasant dream. But alas! there has always been a  beginning and an ending to everything under the sun, good or evil. The  awakening from an easy life's dream was occasioned by a crushing blow.  It fell on the day of final reckoning, when Don Guillermo, my good  uncle, thought the time was propitious to realize something tangible on  sundry duly signed, sealed, and witnessed instruments. There was a  rumpus; neither earthquake nor cyclone would have caused a greater  commotion in the community. What, then, did this lying gringo mean by  resorting to the trickery of the United States law courts and the power  and services of the county sheriff?

I took some good  birch sticks from the wood-box, encouraged them with a handful of dry  cones, and, as they threw out their cheerful warmth, I became more and  more content to remain a man, and leave my boyish days tied up, like  old letters, in an out-of-the-way corner where I could take them out  and live them over again at will.          V    THE CRACKED BELL      There was no doubt whatever of its melancholy condition. Cracked it  was, and cracked it had been for the last two years. Just how the  crack came there, nobody knew. It was, indeed, a tiny flaw, long ago  covered by green rust, and apparently as harmless as the veriest  thread or a wisp of straw, lodging for a moment on the old bell's  brazen sides. But when the clapper began to swing, and gave one timid  touch to the smooth inner surface of its small cell, the flaw made  itself known, and as the strokes grew louder and angrier, the  dissonance so clattered and battered against the ears of the parish,  that after two years' patient endurance of this infliction (which they  considered a direct discipline, to humble their pride over a new coat  of white paint on the little church), one small, black-bonneted sister  rose in prayer-meeting and begged that the bell be left quiet, or at  least muffled for one day, as it disturbed her daughter, whom all the  village knew to be suffering from nervous prostration.    Emboldened by this declaration of war, a deacon declared that it was  an insult to religion and its Founder, to ring such a bell. It was the  laughing-stock of the village, he added, and its flat discords were  but a signal for derision on the part of every scoffer and backslider  in the parish.    Other evidence of convincing character was given by various members of  the congregation; the bell was tried, convicted and sentenced; and  more than one face showed its relief as good old Dr. Manson, the  pastor, instructed the sexton publicly to omit the customary call to  services on the following Sabbath.    \"I hope,\" he further said, looking around gravely on his people, \"that  you will all make more than usual effort to be in your pews promptly  at half-past ten.\"    For a time the members of the First Congregational Society of North  Penfield were noticeably and commendably prompt in their attendance  upon all services. They were so afraid that they should be late that  they arrived at the meeting-house a good while before the opening  hymn. Dr. Manson was gratified, the village wits were put down, and  the old bell hung peacefully in the belfry over the attentive  worshipers, as silent as they. Snow and rain painted its surface with  vivid tints, and the swallows learned that they could perch upon it  without danger of its being jerked away from their slender feet.    There was no other meeting-house in the town, and as the nearest  railroad was miles away, the sound of a clear-toned bell floating down  from the summer sky, or sending its sweet echoes vibrating through a  wintry twilight in an oft-repeated mellow call to prayers, was almost  forgotten.    Gradually the congregation fell into the habit of dropping in of a  Sunday morning while the choir were singing the voluntary, or  remaining in the vestibule where, behind the closed doors, they had a  bit of gossip while they waited for the rustle within which announced  the completion of the pastor's long opening prayer. It became a rare  occurrence for all to be actually settled in their pews when the text  was given out. The same tardiness was noticeable in the Friday evening  meetings; and, odd to say, a certain spirit of indolence seemed to  creep over the services themselves.    Whereas in former days the farmers and their wives were wont to come  bustling briskly into the vestry while the bell was ringing, and the  cheerful hum of voices arose in the informal handshaking \"before  meeting,\" soon quieting and then blending joyously in the stirring  strains of \"How Firm a Foundation,\" or \"Onward, Christian Soldiers,\"  followed by one brief, earnest prayer or exhortation after another, in  quick succession, in these later days it was quite different. It was  difficult to carry the first hymn through, as there were rarely enough  good singers present to sustain the air. Now it was the pianist who  was late, now the broad-shouldered mill-owner, whose rich bass was  indeed a \"firm foundation\" for all timid sopranos and altos; now the  young man who could sing any part with perfect confidence, and often  did wander over all four in the course of a single verse, lending a  helping hand, so to speak, wherever it was needed.    The halting and dispirited hymn made the members self-distrustful and  melancholy at the outset. There were long pauses during which all the  sluggish or tired-out brothers and sisters nodded in the heated room,  and the sensitive and nervous clutched shawl fringes and coat buttons  in agonized fidgets. The meetings became so dull and heavy that slight  excuses were sufficient to detain easy-going members at home,  especially the young people. It was a rare sight now to see bright  eyes and rosy cheeks in the room. The members discussed the dismal  state of affairs, which was only too plain, and laid the blame on the  poor old minister.    \"His sermons haven't the power they had once, Brother Stimpson,\"  remarked Deacon Fairweather, shaking his head sadly, as they trudged  home from afternoon service one hot Sunday in August. \"There's  somethin' wantin'. I don't jestly know what.\"    \"He ain't pussonal enough. You want to be pussonal to do any good in a  parish. There's Squire Radbourne, now. Everybody knows he sets up  Sunday evenin's and works on his law papers. I say there ought to be a  reg'lar downright discourse on Sabbath breakin'.\"    \"Thet's so, thet's so,\" assented the deacon. \"And Brother Langworth  hasn't been nigh evenin' meetin' for mor'n six weeks.\"    From one faulty member to another they wandered, forgetting, as they  jogged along the familiar path side by side, the banks of goldenrod  beside them, the blue sky and fleecy clouds above, the blue hills in  the distance, and all the glory and brightness of the blessed summer  day.    The next morning, North Penfield experienced a shock. The white-haired  pastor, overcome by extra labor, increasing cares, the feebleness of  age, or a combination of all these causes, had sunk down upon his bed  helplessly, on his return from the little white meeting-house the  afternoon before, never to rise again until he should leave behind him  the weary earth-garments that now but hindered his slow and painful  steps.    The townspeople were greatly concerned, for the old man was dearly  loved by young and old. Those who of late had criticised now  remembered Dr. Manson's palmy days, when teams came driving in from  Penfield Center, \"The Hollow,\" and two or three other adjoining  settlements, to listen to the impassioned discourses of the young  clergyman.    A meeting of the committee was called at once, to consider the affairs  of the bereft church--for bereft they felt it to be--and take steps  for an immediate supply during the vacancy of the pulpit. Two months  later Dr. Manson passed peacefully away, and there was one more mound  in the little churchyard.    The snows of early December already lay deep on road and field before  the North Penfield Parish, in a regularly-called and organized  meeting, was given to understand that a new minister was settled. Half  a dozen candidates had preached to the people but only one had met  with favor.    Harold Olsen was a Norwegian by parentage, though born in America.  Tall and straight as the pines of the Norseland, with clear, flashing  blue eyes and honest, winning smile, the congregation began to love  him before he was half through his first sermon. His sweet-faced  little wife made friends with a dozen people between services; by  nightfall the question was practically settled, and so was the Rev.  Harold Olsen, \"the new minister,\" as he was called for years  afterward.    At the beginning of the second week in December, Harold ascended the  pulpit stairs of the North Penfield meeting-house, feeling very humble  and very thankful in the face of his new duties. He loved his work,  his people, his wife and his God; and here he was, with them all four  at once.    Sleigh-bells jingled merrily outside the door; one family after  another came trooping in, muffled to the ears, and moved demurely up  the central or side aisles to their high-backed pews.    The sunlight found its way in under the old-fashioned fan-shaped  blinds at the tops of the high windows, and rested upon gray hair and  brown, on figures bowed with grief and age, on restless, eager  children, on the pulpit itself, and finally upon the golden-edged  leaves of the old Bible.    Still the people came in. A hymn was given out and sung. While Harold  was lifting his soul to heaven on the wings of his prayer, he could  not help hearing the noise of heavy boots in the meeting-house entry,  stamping off the snow. His fervent \"Amen\" was the signal for a draft  of cold air from the doors, followed by a dozen late comers.    After the sermon, which was so simple and straightforward that it went  directly to the hearts of the people, he hastened to confer with his  deacons.    \"The bell didn't ring this morning, Brother Fairweather. What was the  matter?\" he asked, after a warm hand-grasp all round.    \"Why, the fact is, sir, there ain't no bell.\"    \"That is, none to speak of,\" put in Deacon Stimpson apologetically.  \"There's a bell up there, but it got so cracked an' out o' tune that  nobody could stan' it, sick or well.\"    The Rev. Harold Olsen's eyes twinkled. \"How long have you gone without  this unfortunate bell?\"    \"Oh! a matter o' two or three years, I guess.\"    \"Weddings, funerals, and all?\"    \"Well, yes,\" reluctantly, \"I b'lieve so. I did feel bad when we  follered the minister"]]]
