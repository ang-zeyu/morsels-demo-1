So I am satisfied to live as a Bear lives.\"    \"That,\" said the old Nome, \"is because you know nothing better.  When  we have conquered the Oz people, and you become a man, you'll be glad  of it.\"    The immense Leopard rested his chin on the log and seemed thoughtful.    \"The beasts of the forest must decide this matter for themselves,\" he  said.  \"Go you, Rango the Gray Ape, and tell your monkey tribe to order  all the forest beasts to assemble in the Great Clearing at sunrise  to-morrow.  When all are gathered together, this mixed-up Beast who is  a magician shall talk to them and tell them what he has told us.  Then,  if they decide to fight the Oz people, who have declared war on us, I  will lead the beasts to battle.\"    Rango the Gray Ape turned at once and glided swiftly through the forest  on his mission.  The Bear gave a grunt and walked away.  Gugu the King  rose and stretched himself.  Then he said to Ruggedo: \"Meet us at  sunrise to-morrow,\" and with stately stride vanished among the trees.    The man-unicorn, left alone with the strangers, suddenly stopped his  foolish prancing.    \"You'd better make me a Unicorn again,\" he said.  \"I like being a man,  but the forest beasts won't know I'm their friend, Loo, and they might  tear me in pieces before morning.\"    So Kiki changed him back to his former shape, and the Unicorn departed  to join his people.    Ruggedo the Nome was much pleased with his success.    \"To-morrow,\" he said to Kiki Aru, \"we'll win over these beasts and set  them to fight and conquer the Oz people.  Then I will have my revenge  on Ozma and Dorothy and all the rest of my enemies.\"    \"But I am doing all the work,\" said Kiki.    \"Never mind; you're going to be King of Oz,\" promised Ruggedo.    \"Will the big Leopard let me be King?\" asked the boy anxiously.    The Nome came close to him and whispered:    \"If Gugu the Leopard opposes us, you will transform him into a tree,  and then he will be helpless.\"    \"Of course,\" agreed Kiki, and he said to himself: \"I shall also  transform this deceitful Nome into a tree, for he lies and I cannot  trust him.\"          9.  The Isle of the Magic Flower      The Glass Cat was a good guide and led Trot and Cap'n Bill by straight  and easy paths through all the settled part of the Munchkin Country,  and then into the north section where there were few houses, and  finally through a wild country where there were no houses or paths at  all.  But the walking was not difficult and at last they came to the  edge of a forest and stopped there to make camp and sleep until morning.    From branches of trees Cap'n Bill made a tiny house that was just big  enough for the little girl to crawl into and lie down.  But first they  ate some of the food Trot had carried in the basket.    \"Don't you want some, too?\" she asked the Glass Cat.    \"No,\" answered the creature.    \"I suppose you'll hunt around an' catch a mouse,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.    \"Me?  Catch a mouse!  Why should I do that?\" inquired the Glass Cat.    \"Why, then you could eat it,\" said the sailor-man.    \"I beg to inform you,\" returned the crystal tabby, \"that I do not eat  mice.  Being transparent, so anyone can see through me, I'd look nice,  wouldn't I, with a common mouse inside me?  But the fact is that I  haven't any stomach or other machinery that would permit me to eat  things.  The careless magician who made me didn't think I'd need to  eat, I suppose.\"    \"Don't you ever get hungry or thirsty?\" asked Trot.    \"Never.  I don't complain, you know, at the way I'm made, for I've  never yet seen any living thing as beautiful as I am.  I have the  handsomest brains in the world.  They're pink, and you can see 'em  work.\"    \"I wonder,\" said Trot thoughtfully, as she ate her bread and jam, \"if  MY brains whirl around in the same way yours do.\"    \"No; not the same way, surely,\" returned the Glass Cat; \"for, in that  case, they'd be as good as MY brains, except that they're hidden under  a thick, boney skull.\"    \"Brains,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"is of all kinds and work different  ways.  But I've noticed that them as thinks that their brains is best  is often mistook.\"    Trot was a little disturbed by sounds from the forest, that night, for  many beasts seemed prowling among the trees, but she was confident  Cap'n Bill would protect her from harm.  And in fact, no beast ventured  from the forest to attack them.    At daybreak they were up again, and after a simple breakfast Cap'n Bill  said to the Glass Cat:    \"Up anchor, Mate, and let's forge ahead.  I don't suppose we're far  from that Magic Flower, are we?\"    \"Not far,\" answered the transparent one, as it led the way into the  forest, \"but it may take you some time to get to it.\"    Before long they reached the bank of a river.  It was not very wide, at  this place, but as they followed the banks in a northerly direction it  gradually broadened.    Suddenly the blue-green leaves of the trees changed to a purple hue,  and Trot noticed this and said:    \"I wonder what made the colors change like that?\"    \"It's because we have left the Munchkin Country and entered the  Gillikin Country,\" explained the Glass Cat.  \"Also it's a sign our  journey is nearly ended.\"    The river made a sudden turn, and after the travelers had passed around  the bend, they saw that the stream had now become as broad as a small  lake, and in the center of the Lake they beheld a little island, not  more than fifty feet in extent, either way.  Something glittered in the  middle of this tiny island, and the Glass Cat paused on the bank and  said:    \"There is the gold flower-pot containing the Magic Flower, which is  very curious and beautiful.  If you can get to the island, your task is  ended--except to carry the thing home with you.\"    Cap'n Bill looked at the broad expanse of water and began to whistle a  low, quavering tune.  Trot knew that the whistle meant that Cap'n Bill  was thinking, and the old sailor didn't look at the island as much as  he looked at the trees upon the bank where they stood.  Presently he  took from the big pocket of his coat an axe-blade, wound in an old  cloth to keep the sharp edge from cutting his clothing.  Then, with a  large pocket knife, he cut a small limb from a tree and whittled it  into a handle for his axe.    \"Sit down, Trot,\" he advised the girl, as he worked.  \"I've got quite a  job ahead of me now, for I've got to build us a raft.\"    \"What do we need a raft for, Cap'n?\"    \"Why, to take us to the island.  We can't walk under water, in the  river bed, as the Glass Cat did, so we must float atop the water.\"    \"Can you make a raft, Cap'n Bill?\"    \"O' course, Trot, if you give me time.\"    The little girl sat down on a log and gazed at the Island of the Magic  Flower.  Nothing else seemed to grow on the tiny isle.  There was no  tree, no shrub, no grass, even, as far as she could make out from that  distance.  But the gold pot glittered in the rays of the sun, and Trot  could catch glimpses of glowing colors above it, as the Magic Flower  changed from one sort to another.    \"When I was here before,\" remarked the Glass Cat, lazily reclining at  the girl's feet, \"I saw two Kalidahs on this very bank, where they had  come to drink.\"    \"What are Kalidahs?\" asked the girl.    \"The most powerful and ferocious beasts in all Oz.  This forest is  their especial home, and so there are few other beasts to be found  except monkeys.  The monkeys are spry enough to keep out of the way of  the fierce Kalidahs, which attack all other animals and often fight  among themselves.\"    \"Did they try to fight you when you saw 'em?\" asked Trot, getting very  much excited.    \"Yes.  They sprang upon me in an instant; but I lay flat on the ground,  so I wouldn't get my legs broken by the great weight of the beasts, and  when they tried to bite me I laughed at them and jeered them until they  were frantic with rage, for they nearly broke their teeth on my hard  glass.  So, after a time, they discovered they could not hurt me, and  went away.  It was great fun.\"    \"I hope they don't come here again to drink,--not while we're here,  anyhow,\" returned the girl, \"for I'm not made of glass, nor is Cap'n  Bill, and if those bad beasts bit us, we'd get hurt.\"    Cap'n Bill was cutting from the trees some long stakes, making them  sharp at one end and leaving a crotch at the other end.  These were to  bind the logs of his raft together.  He had fashioned several and was  just finishing another when the Glass Cat cried: \"Look out!  There's a  Kalidah coming toward us.\"    Trot jumped up, greatly frightened, and looked at the terrible animal  as if fascinated by its fierce eyes, for the Kalidah was looking at  her, too, and its look wasn't at all friendly.  But Cap'n Bill called  to her: \"Wade into the river, Trot, up to your knees--an' stay there!\"  and she obeyed him at once.  The sailor-man hobbled forward, the stake  in one hand and his axe in the other, and got between the girl and the  beast, which sprang upon him with a growl of defiance.    Cap'n Bill moved pretty slowly, sometimes, but now he was quick as  could be.  As the Kalidah sprang toward him he stuck out his wooden leg  and the point of it struck the beast between the eyes and sent it  rolling upon the ground.  Before it could get upon its feet again the  sailor pushed the sharp stake right through its body and then with the  flat side of the axe he hammered the stake as far into the ground as it  would go.  By this means he captured the great beast and made it  harmless, for try as it would, it could not get away from the stake  that held it.    Cap'n Bill knew he could not kill the Kalidah, for no living thing in  Oz can be killed, so he stood back and watched the beast wriggle and  growl and paw the earth with its sharp claws, and then, satisfied it  could not escape, he told Trot to come out of the water again and dry  her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41934"],[0,"Idling in Italy: Studies of literature and of life (#8)"],[1,"the merit and significance of  his poetical productions which, should they find general acceptance, may  give Graf the most important position in the poetic field since Pascoli.  Neither his intellectual reactions nor his point of view, however, is  Italian. They show both his Teutonic origin and inclinations. His last  verses, \"Nuove Rime della Selva\" (\"New Rhymes of the Forest\"), are full  of delightful imagery, delicate fantasy, and gentle sentiment and they  do not display the materialism, pessimism, or the figurative symbolism  of his early works. In 1900 he published a psychological romance  entitled \"Riscatto\" (\"Redemption\"), admittedly a spiritual autobiography  which heralded and prepared his after-faith, which was thus also a  battle for a faith against materialistic pessimism, against arid  positivism which had seduced him and against which he reacted. \"He who  seeks God laboriously may become more religious than he who coddles Him  in the firm belief of having found Him.\" His book of poems published in  1895 is the poet's voicings of his struggle to this end. His fame is  greater as a dramatist and litterateur than as a poet. Nevertheless some  of his poetical writings show a rare imagery, a facile capacity for  description and versification, though a pessimistic psychology. His  best-known poems are entitled \"Venezie\" (\"Venices\"), \"Le Rose sono  sfiorite\" (\"Faded Roses\"), \"Silenzio\" (\"Silence\"), \"Anelito\"  (\"Longings\"). Gian says of him: \"He did not attain in his career as  teacher, writer, and poet that outward recognition that fame and fortune  usually bestow on their favorites,\" but as a recompense \"he was honored  with such hatreds as are never the lot of mediocrities and which for  this very reason are the sanction and almost the guaranty of true  worth.\"    Much of the interesting literature of the past generation has appeared  in dialect, especially the poetic literature.    Salvatore di Giacomo must be put at the head of all dialectical poets of  Italy. He is very little known to English readers, because he has been  so little translated, save into German. He is the librarian of the  National Library of the Naples Museum. The subjects of his poems are  drawn from Naples and its people, its beauty and their ardency; the  realism of his verse is sober, its sentiments are healthy and true to  human nature but to the human nature of a voluptuous, passionate people.  He writes of love in all its aspects, and of death, physical, emotional,  and mental. He knows the hopes, aspirations, sympathies, longings,  customs of his fellow Neapolitans; he knows them when they are ill, when  they are happy, and when they are depressed, when they are fortunate and  when they are seeped in misfortune, and he puts them into lyrics that  they understand and that poetasters praise.    His lyrics have been collected into one volume called \"Poesie.\" He has  been called the Robert Burns of Italy, and it is likely that he deserves  it. It is to be regretted that no one has attempted to render him in  English.    An Italian poet neglected and almost unknown during his lifetime  (1872-1919), whose literary output was very small, is slowly coming to  his estate and it is not unlikely that the coming generation will hail  Ceccardo Roccatagliata-Ceccardi as one of Italy's greatest modern poets.  \"Sonetti e Poemi\" contains practically all of his verse save a small  collection published when he was twenty.          CHAPTER III    GABRIELE D'ANNUNZIO--POET, PILOT, AND PIRATE      The most conspicuous name in the annals of Italian literature of the  generation now passing is that assumed by a child or a youth when the  voice first whispered to him that he had been chosen to announce the  coming of a new era, to blaze the way for a new social and national  life: Gabriele D'Annunzio. He was born at Pescara in the Regno, March  13, 1863, the son of Francescopaolo D'Annunzio and of his wife, Luisa de  Benedictis of Ortona. A studied effort has been made to envelop his  birth and parentage in a mantle of mystery, but it has been thwarted.    One day of his infancy, in Ferravilla-on-the-Sea, suddenly there came a  sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind. From that moment the  little Annunciator was filled with the gift of verbal expression. He  enhanced the endowment by diligent study in the high school at Prato, in  Tuscany, where he spent his boyhood. Thus did he acquire an unparalleled  mastery of the Italian language. The gods of mythology, the Hellenic  heroes and philosophers, the emperors and courtesans of Pagan Rome were  the loves of his infancy. After Carducci's \"Odi Barbari\" exploded his  poetic magazine he looked about to find a god and a Greek upon whom to  model his conduct. He recalled Dionysus going through the world with  Priapus ostentatiously displaying the Phallus, and the die was cast.    But he must have a philosophy as well. He who taught that eternal flux  and change is the only actuality; that all phenomena are in a state of  continuous transition from non-existence to existence and vice versa;  that everything is and is not; all things are and nothing remains; that  all things must be reduced by way of quasi-condensation to the primary  matter from which they originated, in brief--Heraclitus, whose name  signified \"he who rails at the people,\" was the one that he selected.  The process of quasi-reduction was to be preceded by purification  through pleasure, and pleasure was to be obtained by stimulation of the  senses. The more they were stimulated the greater became their potency  for purification. When he looked about the world he found others had  been seduced by Heraclitus. Nietzsche, whose activity preceded  D'Annunzio's by a few years, was the most conspicuous exponent of the  Eternal Recurrence. He too taught a master morality, a morality which  says yea to life and nay to morals, rules, and conventions. Christianity  is the moral code of slaves. Instinct is the true wisdom. The genesic  instinct is the basis of all other instincts. Therefore cultivate it,  for in that way one becomes a superman and begets a race of supermen. If  we must have a statue of Apollo, as Socrates and Christ taught, let us  make it a feminine figure and place it beside Dionysus, first erected by  animal men, and around them let us dance a frenzied tarantella while we  intoxicate ourselves with foaming wine, the product of sensuous  fermentation.    No attempt will be made here to put an estimate upon D'Annunzio's  conduct or his accomplishments of the past five years, save to say that  they have been in keeping with his previous life.    Literary criticism is concerned with the genius of the writer and the  way in which he makes that genius manifest. It is not concerned with the  morals or immorality of his writing, and yet it has to take some  cognizance of them, especially if they are at variance with that which  is considered moral or approximately moral. No one who is a public  figure or whose activities are concerned with the welfare of the public,  whether it be with their diversion, instruction, or protection, can  comport himself in a way that is flagrantly offensive to the public  without showing the effect of it in his writings. For instance, a writer  produces a masterpiece of literature, one that has qualities of  conception and construction that evoke universal admiration. It has been  written for one of three reasons, or all of them. First, because the  artist has it in him and he must externalize it, a creative craving that  must be satisfied; second, he has a purpose in doing it--he wants to  amuse, amaze, or instruct people; third, he wants to gain fame or money.    If he is utterly oblivious to the two last, his writings may be as  immoral or unrighteous as he wishes to make them. If the public does not  wish to read them it need not, and if it considers them injurious to  others whose mental capacity does not enable them to judge whether they  are proper or injurious they can be suppressed. If, however, the writer  is animated to production by either of the latter two motives, he must  be reconciled to having an estimate made of his work not only from the  point of view of literary criticism, but also from the point of view of  the fitness of his works for literary consumption. That is, he must be  reconciled to attempts at estimating whether or not the world would not  have been better off without his writings.    There are few writers to whom these remarks apply with greater force  than Gabriele D'Annunzio. It is generally admitted that he is the most  consummate master of Italian verse now living. Though his prose writings  show that he is not a literary craftsman of the first order, he has  understood that art rises out of our primal nature and that it is  instinctive. He has sung the praises of sensualism as they never have  been sung in modern times, and he has panoplied the preliminaries to  love's embrace with garlands made of flowers of forced blooming,  artificially perfumed and colored so that the average human being does  not recognize them as products of nature. He has preached and practised  a moral code the antithesis of Christianity, and yet no one has sought  seriously to save his soul.    In truth, D'Annunzio had tired the world of him. The people of it were  tired of him as they might have been of a radiantly beautiful woman who  had become a gorgeously decorated strumpet constantly walking up and  down in the world seeking praise and admiration. When he went to Paris  the world seemed to be satisfied that he should disappear in that  maelstrom, as it was willing that a contemporary sensuous egocentrist  should disappear when he left Reading Gaol, but D'Annunzio must enter  upon the final stage of his mission from the gods, and the Great War  gave him the opportunity.    Although so long a conspicuous figure in the public eye, he has managed  to wrap certain layers of the"]]]
