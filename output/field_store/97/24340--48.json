The chackma lives among the mountains of the Cape of Good Hope, where he  attains about the size of an English mastiff and even greater strength.  He descends to the plains on foraging expeditions, and, when not  attacked, will usually make off on the approach of danger, but if  aroused to anger can both show and use his teeth, and is far superior to  the average English boy in throwing stones.      The Baboon's Utility.    Le Vaillant gives an interesting account of a chackma baboon which  accompanied him through South Africa, and which bore the name of Kees.  He says: \"I made him my taster. Whenever we found fruits or roots, with  which my Hottentots were unacquainted, we did not touch them till Kees  had tasted them. If he threw them away, we concluded that they were  either of a disagreeable flavour, or of a pernicious quality, and left  them untasted. The monkey possesses a peculiar property, wherein he  differs greatly from other animals, and resembles man,--namely, that he  is by nature equally gluttonous and inquisitive. Without necessity, and  without appetite, he tastes every thing that falls in his way, or that  is given to him. But Kees had a still more valuable quality,--he was an  excellent sentinel; for, whether by day or night, he immediately sprang  up on the slightest appearance of danger. By his cry, and the symptoms  of fear which he exhibited, we were always apprized of the approach of  an enemy, even though the dogs perceived nothing of it. The latter, at  length, learned to rely upon him with such confidence, that they slept  on in perfect tranquillity. I often took Kees with me when I went  hunting; and when he saw me preparing for sport, he exhibited the most  lively demonstrations of joy. On the way, he would climb into the trees  to look for gum, of which he was very fond. Sometimes he discovered to  me honey, deposited in the clefts of rocks, or hollow trees. But, if he  happened to have met with neither honey nor gum, and his appetite had  become sharp by his running about, I always witnessed a very ludicrous  scene. In those cases, he looked for roots, which he ate with great  greediness, especially a particular kind, which, to his cost, I also  found to be very well tasted and refreshing, and therefore insisted upon  sharing with him. In order to draw these roots out of the ground, he  employed a very ingenious method, which afforded me much amusement. He  laid hold of the herbage with his teeth, stemmed his fore feet against  the ground, and drew back his head, which gradually pulled out the root.  But if this expedient, for which he employed his whole strength, did not  succeed, he laid hold of the leaves as before, as close to the ground as  possible, and then threw himself heels over head, which gave such a  concussion to the root, that it never failed to come out.      The Tame Baboon.    \"Serpents excepted, there were no animals of whom Kees stood in such  great dread as of his own species,--perhaps owing to a consciousness of  loss of natural capacity. Sometimes he heard the cry of other apes among  the mountains, and, terrified as he was, he yet answered them. But, if  they approached nearer, and he saw any of them, he fled, with a hideous  cry, crept between our legs, and trembled over his whole body. It was  very difficult to compose him, and it required some time before he  recovered from his fright.      The Cunning of the Baboon    \"Like all other animals, Kees was addicted to stealing. He understood  admirably well how to loose the strings of a basket, in order to take  victuals out of it, especially milk, of which he was very fond. My  people chastised him for these thefts; but that did not make him amend  his conduct. I myself sometimes whipped him; but then he ran away, and  did not return again to the tent until it grew dark. Once, as I was  about to dine, and had put the beans, which I had boiled for myself,  upon a plate, I heard the voice of a bird with which I was not  acquainted. I left my dinner standing, seized my gun, and ran out of the  tent. After the space of about a quarter of an hour I returned, with the  bird in my hand, but, to my astonishment, found not a single bean upon  the plate. Kees had stolen them all, and taken himself out of the way.  When he had committed any trespass of this kind, he used always, about  the time when I drank tea, to return quietly, and seat himself in his  usual place, with every appearance of innocence, as if nothing had  happened; but this evening he did not let himself be seen. And, on the  following day, also, he was not seen by any of us; and, in consequence,  I began to grow seriously uneasy about him, and apprehensive that he  might be lost for ever. But, on the third day, one of my people, who had  been to fetch water, informed me that he had seen Kees in the  neighbourhood, but that, as soon as the animal espied him, he had  concealed himself again. I immediately went out and beat the whole  neighbourhood with my dogs. All at once, I heard a cry, like that which  Kees used to make, when I returned from my shooting, and had not taken  him with me. I looked about, and at length espied him, endeavouring to  hide himself behind the large branches of a tree. I now called to him in  a friendly tone of voice, and made motions to him to come down to me.  But he could not trust me, and I was obliged to climb up the tree to  fetch him. He did not attempt to fly, and we returned together to my  quarters; here he expected to receive his punishment; but I did nothing,  as it would have been of no use.      The Loyalty of the Baboon.    \"An officer, wishing to put the fidelity of my baboon to the test,  pretended to strike me. At this he flew in a violent rage, and, from  that time, could never endure the sight of the officer. If he only saw  him at a distance he began to cry, and make all kinds of grimaces, which  evidently showed that he wished to revenge the insult that had been done  to me; he ground his teeth; and endeavoured, with all his might, to fly  at his face, but that was out of his power, as he was chained down. The  offender several times endeavoured, in vain, to conciliate him, by  offering him dainties, but he remained long implacable.      The Intelligence of the Baboon.    \"When any eatables were pilfered, at my quarters, the fault was always  laid upon Kees; and rarely was the accusation unfounded. For a time the  eggs, which a hen laid me, were constantly stolen, and I wished to  ascertain whether I had to attribute this loss also to him. For this  purpose I went one morning to watch him, and waited till the hen  announced, by her cackling, that she had laid an egg. Kees was sitting  upon my vehicle; but, the moment he heard the hen's voice, he leapt  down, and was running to fetch the egg. When he saw me, he suddenly  stopped, and affected a careless posture, swaying himself backwards upon  his hind legs, and assuming a very innocent look; in short, he employed  all his art to deceive me with respect to his design. His hypocritical  manA\"uvres only confirmed my suspicions, and, in order, in my turn, to  deceive him, I pretended not to attend to him, and turned my back to the  bush where the hen was cackling, upon which he immediately sprang to the  place. I ran after him, and came up to him at the moment when he had  broken the egg and was swallowing it. Having caught the thief in the  fact, I gave him a good beating upon the spot, but this severe  chastisement did not prevent his soon stealing fresh-laid eggs again. As  I was convinced that I should never be able to break Kees off his  natural vices, and that, unless I chained him up every morning, I should  never get an egg, I endeavoured to accomplish my purpose in another  manner; I trained one of my dogs, as soon as the hen cackled, to run to  the nest, and bring me the egg, without breaking it. In a few days, the  dog had learned his lesson; but Kees, as soon as he heard the hen  cackle, ran with him to the nest. A contest now took place between them,  who should have the egg; often the dog was foiled, although he was the  stronger of the two. If he gained the victory, he ran joyfully to me  with the egg, and put it into my hand. Kees, nevertheless, followed him,  and did not cease to grumble and make threatening grimaces at him, till  he saw me take the egg,--as if he was comforted for the loss of his  booty by his adversary's not retaining it for himself. If Kees had got  hold of the egg, he endeavoured to run with it to a tree, where, having  devoured it, he threw down the shells upon his adversary, as if to make  game of him. Kees was always the first awake in the morning, and, when  it was the proper time, he awoke the dogs, who were accustomed to his  voice, and, in general, obeyed, without hesitation, the slightest  motions by which he communicated his orders to them, immediately taking  their posts about the tent and carriage, as he directed them.\"      The Bonnet Monkey.    The bonnet monkey is of the genus macacus, and is to be found in many  parts of India. It is characterized by a bonnet, or cap of hair, which  radiates from the centre of the crown. It is known as the _Macacus  Radiatus_. Other species of the genus macacus are the _Rhesus_ monkey,  the _Wanderoo_, the _Barbary Ape_ or _Magot_, and the _Macaque_.      Indian Monkeys.    Many stories are told of the audacity of the Indian monkeys in which  those of the genus macacus come in for more than honourable mention.  Whether in their native haunts, or in European menageries, they are an  endless source of amusement and not unfrequently one of annoyance. In  their free state, they tax the ingenuity of native and European alike by  their mischievous habits and thievish propensities. They climb upon the  tops of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3796"],[0,"Rilla of Ingleside (#8)"],[1," gifted and Mary Vance's white eyes stars of the first magnitude; and  neither of them had the least inkling why Jem Blythe wanted to hoist  the lighthouse flag. \"What does it matter if there's going to be a war  over there in Europe? I'm sure it doesn't concern us.\"    Walter looked at her and had one of his odd visitations of prophecy.    \"Before this war is over,\" he said--or something said through his  lips--\"every man and woman and child in Canada will feel it--you, Mary,  will feel it--feel it to your heart's core. You will weep tears of  blood over it. The Piper has come--and he will pipe until every corner  of the world has heard his awful and irresistible music. It will be  years before the dance of death is over--years, Mary. And in those  years millions of hearts will break.\"    \"Fancy now!\" said Mary who always said that when she couldn't think of  anything else to say. She didn't know what Walter meant but she felt  uncomfortable. Walter Blythe was always saying odd things. That old  Piper of his--she hadn't heard anything about him since their playdays  in Rainbow Valley--and now here he was bobbing up again. She didn't  like it, and that was the long and short of it.    \"Aren't you painting it rather strong, Walter?\" asked Harvey Crawford,  coming up just then. \"This war won't last for years--it'll be over in a  month or two. England will just wipe Germany off the map in no time.\"    \"Do you think a war for which Germany has been preparing for twenty  years will be over in a few weeks?\" said Walter passionately. \"This  isn't a paltry struggle in a Balkan corner, Harvey. It is a death  grapple. Germany comes to conquer or to die. And do you know what will  happen if she conquers? Canada will be a German colony.\"    \"Well, I guess a few things will happen before that,\" said Harvey  shrugging his shoulders. \"The British navy would have to be licked for  one; and for another, Miller here, now, and I, we'd raise a dust,  wouldn't we, Miller? No Germans need apply for this old country, eh?\"    Harvey ran down the steps laughing.    \"I declare, I think all you boys talk the craziest stuff,\" said Mary  Vance in disgust. She got up and dragged Miller off to the rock-shore.  It didn't happen often that they had a chance for a talk together; Mary  was determined that this one shouldn't be spoiled by Walter Blythe's  silly blather about Pipers and Germans and such like absurd things.  They left Walter standing alone on the rock steps, looking out over the  beauty of Four Winds with brooding eyes that saw it not.    The best of the evening was over for Rilla, too. Ever since Jack  Elliott's announcement, she had sensed that Kenneth was no longer  thinking about her. She felt suddenly lonely and unhappy. It was worse  than if he had never noticed her at all. Was life like this--something  delightful happening and then, just as you were revelling in it,  slipping away from you? Rilla told herself pathetically that she felt  years older than when she had left home that evening. Perhaps she  did--perhaps she was. Who knows? It does not do to laugh at the pangs  of youth. They are very terrible because youth has not yet learned that  \"this, too, will pass away.\" Rilla sighed and wished she were home, in  bed, crying into her pillow.    \"Tired?\" said Kenneth, gently but absently--oh, so absently. He really  didn't care a bit whether she were tired or not, she thought.    \"Kenneth,\" she ventured timidly, \"you don't think this war will matter  much to us in Canada, do you?\"    \"Matter? Of course it will matter to the lucky fellows who will be able  to take a hand. I won't--thanks to this confounded ankle. Rotten luck,  I call it.\"    \"I don't see why we should fight England's battles,\" cried Rilla.  \"She's quite able to fight them herself.\"    \"That isn't the point. We are part of the British Empire. It's a family  affair. We've got to stand by each other. The worst of it is, it will  be over before I can be of any use.\"    \"Do you mean that you would really volunteer to go if it wasn't for  your ankle? asked Rilla incredulously.    \"Sure I would. You see they'll go by thousands. Jem'll be off, I'll bet  a cent--Walter won't be strong enough yet, I suppose. And Jerry  Meredith--he'll go! And I was worrying about being out of football this  year!\"    Rilla was too startled to say anything. Jem--and Jerry! Nonsense! Why  father and Mr. Meredith wouldn't allow it. They weren't through  college. Oh, why hadn't Jack Elliott kept his horrid news to himself?    Mark Warren came up and asked her to dance. Rilla went, knowing Kenneth  didn't care whether she went or stayed. An hour ago on the sand-shore  he had been looking at her as if she were the only being of any  importance in the world. And now she was nobody. His thoughts were full  of this Great Game which was to be played out on bloodstained fields  with empires for stakes--a Game in which womenkind could have no part.  Women, thought Rilla miserably, just had to sit and cry at home. But  all this was foolishness. Kenneth couldn't go--he admitted that  himself--and Walter couldn't--thank goodness for that--and Jem and  Jerry would have more sense. She wouldn't worry--she would enjoy  herself. But how awkward Mark Warren was! How he bungled his steps!  Why, for mercy's sake, did boys try to dance who didn't know the first  thing about dancing; and who had feet as big as boats? There, he had  bumped her into somebody! She would never dance with him again!    She danced with others, though the zest was gone out of the performance  and she had begun to realize that her slippers hurt her badly. Kenneth  seemed to have gone--at least nothing was to be seen of him. Her first  party was spoiled, though it had seemed so beautiful at one time. Her  head ached--her toes burned. And worse was yet to come. She had gone  down with some over-harbour friends to the rock-shore where they all  lingered as dance after dance went on above them. It was cool and  pleasant and they were tired. Rilla sat silent, taking no part in the  gay conversation. She was glad when someone called down that the  over-harbour boats were leaving. A laughing scramble up the lighthouse  rock followed. A few couples still whirled about in the pavilion but  the crowd had thinned out. Rilla looked about her for the Glen group.  She could not see one of them. She ran into the lighthouse. Still, no  sign of anybody. In dismay she ran to the rock steps, down which the  over-harbour guests were hurrying. She could see the boats below--where  was Jem's--where was Joe's?    \"Why, Rilla Blythe, I thought you'd be gone home long ago,\" said Mary  Vance, who was waving her scarf at a boat skimming up the channel,  skippered by Miller Douglas.    \"Where are the rest?\" gasped Rilla.    \"Why, they're gone--Jem went an hour ago--Una had a headache. And the  rest went with Joe about fifteen minutes ago. See--they're just going  around Birch Point. I didn't go because it's getting rough and I knew  I'd be seasick. I don't mind walking home from here. It's only a mile  and a half. I s'posed you'd gone. Where were you?\"    \"Down on the rocks with Jem and Mollie Crawford. Oh, why didn't they  look for me?\"    \"They did--but you couldn't be found. Then they concluded you must have  gone in the other boat. Don't worry. You can stay all night with me and  we'll 'phone up to Ingleside where you are.\"    Rilla realized that there was nothing else to do. Her lips trembled and  tears came into her eyes. She blinked savagely--she would not let Mary  Vance see her crying. But to be forgotten like this! To think nobody  had thought it worth while to make sure where she was--not even Walter.  Then she had a sudden dismayed recollection.    \"My shoes,\" she exclaimed. \"I left them in the boat.\"    \"Well, I never,\" said Mary. \"You're the most thoughtless kid I ever  saw. You'll have to ask Hazel Lewison to lend you a pair of shoes.\"    \"I won't.\" cried Rilla, who didn't like the said Hazel. \"I'll go  barefoot first.\"    Mary shrugged her shoulders.    \"Just as you like. Pride must suffer pain. It'll teach you to be more  careful. Well, let's hike.\"    Accordingly they hiked. But to \"hike\" along a deep-rutted, pebbly lane  in frail, silver-hued slippers with high French heels, is not an  exhilarating performance. Rilla managed to limp and totter along until  they reached the harbour road; but she could go no farther in those  detestable slippers. She took them and her dear silk stockings off and  started barefoot. That was not pleasant either; her feet were very  tender and the pebbles and ruts of the road hurt them. Her blistered  heels smarted. But physical pain was almost forgotten in the sting of  humiliation. This was a nice predicament! If Kenneth Ford could see her  now, limping along like a little girl with a stone bruise! Oh, what a  horrid way for her lovely party to end! She just had to cry--it was too  terrible. Nobody cared for her--nobody bothered about her at all. Well,  if she caught cold from walking home barefoot on a dew-wet road and  went into a decline perhaps they would be sorry. She furtively wiped  her tears away with her scarf--handkerchiefs seemed to have vanished  like shoes!--but she could not help sniffling. Worse and worse!    \"You've got a cold, I see,\" said Mary. \"You ought to have known you  would, sitting down in the wind on those rocks. Your mother won't let  you go out again in a hurry I can tell you. It's certainly been  something of a party. The Lewisons know how to do things, I'll say that  for them, though Hazel Lewison is no choice of mine. My, how black she  looked when she saw you dancing with Ken Ford. And so did that little  hussy of an Ethel Reese. What a flirt he is!\"    \"I don't think he's a flirt,\" said Rilla as defiantly as two desperate  sniffs would let her.    \"You'll know more about men when you're as old as I am,\" said Mary  patronizingly. \"Mind you, it doesn't do to believe all they"]]]
