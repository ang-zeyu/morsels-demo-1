Biol. Soc. Washington,         7:170, September 29, 1892.    _Range._--Southern Nayarit, Michoacan, Mexico, Morelos, Puebla, and  central Veracruz, southeastward to western Nicaragua, but unknown from  southern Veracruz, Tabasco, and the Yucatan Peninsula (see Figure 10);  occurs principally in the arid upper and lower divisions of the Tropical  Life-zone.    _Characters for ready recognition._--Unless otherwise noted, characters  are usable only for the two age-categories of adult and old adult.  Differs from _B. taylori_ in: hind foot 16 millimeters or more;  occipitonasal length, 19 millimeters or more; zygomatic breadth, 10  millimeters or more; rostrum not deflected ventrally at frontoparietal  suture but, instead, curving gradually toward anteriormost point of  nasals; cingular ridges and secondary cusps on teeth more pronounced;  basihyal having anterior pointed entoglossal process, shoulders of  basihyal protruding anteriorly (characteristic of all age categories);  baculum having broader shaft, spatulate to knob-shaped tip, wings at  base projecting anteriorly; baculum more than 3 millimeters long; short  process of incus knob-shaped rather than attenuate; muscular process of  posterior crus of stapes prominent.    _Characters of the species._--Size large (extremes in external  measurements of adults; total length, 100-135; length of tail vertebrae,  33-56; length of hind foot, 14.1-17; length of ear, 9-12); upper parts  dark reddish brown, or ochraceous-buff to nearly black; underparts pale  pinkish buff to white or pale buffy.    _Geographic variation._--Eight subspecies are here recognized (see  Figure 10). Features that vary geographically are external size, color  of pelage, certain cranial dimensions (occipitonasal length, zygomatic  breadth, least interorbital breadth, length of rostrum, length of  incisive foramina, depth and breadth of cranium, and alveolar length of  upper molar tooth-row).    External and cranial size (except for _B. m. handleyi_) is less in the  southernmost subspecies, _B. m. pullus_, _B. m. grisescens_, _B. m.  nigrescens_, and more in the northernmost subspecies, _B. m. musculus_,  _B. m. brunneus_, and _B. m. infernatis_. Increase in size from south to  north is in keeping with Bergman's Rule that within a species, smaller  individuals occur in warmer parts of its geographic range. Southern  pygmy mice at high altitudes average larger than those from low  elevations, except where the two species are sympatric. There the  Southern Pygmy Mouse is uniformly larger, regardless of altitude.    Osgood (1909:257, 259) suggested that degree of relative humidity might  in some way control color of pelage in both _B. taylori_ and _B.  musculus_. In _B. musculus_, the darker subspecies, _B. m. brunneus_,  _B. m. nigrescens_, and _B. m. pullus_, occur in zones of rather  constant high relative humidity, whereas the paler subspecies  _infernatis_, _musculus_, _handleyi_, and to a less extent _grisescens_  and _pallidus_, occur in zones of lower relative humidity. This is in  keeping with Gloger's Rule, which states that melanins increase in the  warm and humid parts of the range of a species, and reddish or  yellowish-brown phaeomelanins prevail in arid climates. _B. m. musculus_  ranges into areas where relative humidity is such that darker pelages  might be expected, but this is in the area where the two species are  sympatric, and color of pelage may be an important character of  recognition.

Near Chilpancingo, Guerrero, rocky situations seemed to be the  preferred habitat. Davis (_loc. cit._) believed that the species has a  wide tolerance to kinds of habitats. In Morelos, Davis and Russell  (1954:75) found these mice to be abundant along rock fences separating  cultivated fields, and in arid lowlands. In Colima, Hooper (1955b:13)  obtained specimens from an open thorn forest in sparse grass and rocky  hillside bounding a stream and in litter below shrubs on the floor of a  nut-palm forest; in Michoacan, these mice were taken in cane grass,  shrubs, and mesquite near an irrigation ditch. From Guatemala, Goodwin  (1934:39, 40) records specimens from Sacapulas, a hot, dry, sandy area  where cactus and sparse grasses are present, and from La Primavera, on  the edges of pine-oak-alder forests. Felten (1958:137) has taken  _musculus_ from bushy areas in El Salvadore. In 1955, I obtained the  southern pygmy mouse 6 mi. SW Izucar de Matemores, Puebla, along a  stream in heavy grass bordered by cypress, willow, fig, bamboo, and in  rocky grazed area near sugar cane fields.    The southern pygmy mouse seems to be locally abundant in certain parts  of its geographic range, and in other parts, scarce. For example,  Dalquest (_in. litt._) recorded the pygmy mouse as common at a place 2  km. N Paraje Nuevo, 1700 feet, Veracruz, where, by means of 50 traps, he  took 14 of these mice in one night. The species was scarcer, although  the habitat seemed suitable, 3 km. N Presidio, 1500 feet, Veracruz,  where he caught only two pygmy mice in several days of trapping. Six  miles southwest of Izucar de Matemores, the pygmy mouse was the most  common rodent. I have trapped for it in Oaxaca and Veracruz in habitats  that seemed almost identical to those mentioned by Dalquest, and also  that at Izucar de Matemores, Puebla, with almost no success. The reason  for the seeming disparity in numbers at different localities having  nearly the same kind of habitat is unknown to me and bears further  investigation.    _Behavior._--Little is recorded concerning the behavior of this species.  David and Russell (_op. cit._:76) found that of small mammals _B.  musculus_ was the first to appear at night. I caught mice of this  species by hand in the afternoon in Puebla. They seemed to be active  from noon until dark. Albert Alcorn wrote in his field notes that  specimens were taken near noon at a place 9 mi. NNW Esteli, Nicaragua.  My impression is that _musculus_ is diurnal to crepuscular.    _Enemies and food._--Owl pellets (thought to be those of a barn owl,  _Tyto alba_) from within the geographic range of _B. musculus_, from 6  mi. SW Izucar de Matemores, yielded mandibular tooth-rows belonging to  _musculus_. Presumably, most of the carnivorous mammals and raptorial  birds within the range of the southern pygmy mouse could be listed as  enemies. Diurnal to crepuscular habits of this mouse may protect it from  some of the nocturnal carnivorous mammals and raptorial birds.    Food of the southern pygmy mouse includes nuts, bark, grass seeds, and  leaves. Dalquest (MS) writes that bits of banana proved to be useful  bait in trapping these mice in Veracruz.    _Reproduction._--Notations concerning lactation and embryos on specimen  labels of females suggest that the southern pygmy mouse breeds in all  months. I have records of pregnant or lactating females in every month,  save January, April, May, and June. The average of 26 counts of embryos  or young per litter is 2.92 (1-4).      =Baiomys musculus brunneus= (J. A. Allen and Chapman)        _Peromyscus musculus brunneus_ J. A. Allen and Chapman, Bull.

It normally comes off in one piece; but, if the snake  is unhealthy or has not had sufficient food or water, the skin may come  off in patches. Frequently one or both of the lens coverings are not  shed immediately and impair the sight. Bathing or swimming ordinarily  causes dried skin to peel off; and, because of the cottonmouth's aquatic  habits, its chances of shedding successfully are much greater than those  of less aquatic snakes. Cottonmouths that have recently shed have bright  and glossy patterns, in contrast to the dull and dark appearance of  those that are preparing to shed.      Frequency of Shedding    Most of our knowledge concerning the frequency of shedding is based upon  observations of captives. It is known that the intervals between  exuviations are largely dependent upon the amount of food taken and the  rate of growth. Unless laboratory conditions closely resemble those in  the field, shedding frequencies in captives probably differ much from  those of free-living snakes.    Only two of my captives shed twice. The intervals between exuviations in  the two snakes were eight and five months, lasting from August to April  and from December to May, respectively. Ten other snakes shed once in  the period from January through July. Stabler (1951:91) presented data  concerning shedding of two cottonmouths kept 12 and 14 years in  captivity. One shed 25 times in 12 years and the other shed 37 times in  14 years, giving an average of 2.1 and 2.6 per year, respectively.  Neither of the snakes shed from December through March, but the period  of shedding corresponded to the period of greatest activity and growth.  In Florida, cottonmouths shed four to six times a year, according to  rate of growth (Allen and Swindell, 1948:7).          FOOD HABITS    Methods of Obtaining Prey      Food is obtained by a variety of methods depending on the type of food,  age of the cottonmouth, and possibly other factors. Some captives lie in  ambush and others crawl slowly in active search. At the first cue of  possible prey, either by sight, scent, or differential temperature  detection by the pit, the snake appears to become alert and flicks its  tongue out at fairly rapid intervals.    By means of the facial or loreal pit found in all crotalids, the snake  is able to detect objects having temperatures different from that of the  surroundings of the objects. In detecting prey the tongue acts to  sharpen the sense of \"smell\" by conveying particles to Jacobson's organs  in the roof of the mouth. On many occasions cottonmouths appeared to  rely solely on sight; they passed within a few inches of prey,  apparently unaware of its presence until it moved. When pools of water  begin to dry up toward the end of summer, cottonmouths often congregate  and feed on dying fish. In these instances the fish are usually taken as  they come to the surface. In laboratory observations moccasins seize  live fish and some moccasins carry the fish until they have received  lethal doses of venom; afterward the fish are swallowed. But grasping  and manipulation of the prey occurs without the fangs' being employed,  especially in the case of dead fish. On one occasion a cottonmouth was  observed to grasp the edge of a glass dish that had contained fish and  apparently retained the odor. On another occasion I placed several fish  in a bowl, rubbed a stick on the fish, and then touched each snake  lightly on the nose with the stick. The snakes crawled directly to the  bowl and began feeding. At other times these same snakes crawled around  the cage in an apparent attempt to locate the food but paid little  attention to fish held in front of them. If the catching of prey under  natural conditions were as uncoordinated as it sometimes is in  captivity, the snakes probably would not be able to survive.    Wharton (1960:127-129) described tail-luring in one individual of a  76-day-old brood of cottonmouths. The snake lay loosely coiled with the  tail held about six centimeters from the ground; a constant waving  motion passed posteriorly through the terminal inch of the tail. These  movements ceased at 7:20 p.m. but were resumed at 7:40 a.m. the  following day. All observations were under artificial light. The \"caudal  lure\" as a means of obtaining prey has been described in other species  and related genera by Neill (1960:194) and Ditmars (1915:424).    Various authors have suggested that the method of capture differs  according to the kind of prey. Allen and Swindell (1948:5) stated that  cottonmouths retain their hold after striking fish or frogs but will  release a mouse after delivering a bite and are timid in striking at  larger rodents. Neill (1947:203) noted that a cottonmouth always waited  several minutes after biting a large rat before approaching its prey.  This same type of behavior has been reported for copperheads (Fitch,  1960:194) and rattlesnakes (Klauber, 1956:618). Cottonmouths observed by  me retained a strong hold on fish, frogs, and sometimes mice, but almost  always released large mice and baby chicks, which were not eaten until  after death.    Different behavior according to type of prey is correlated with ability  of prey to retaliate, although some animals may not be released because  they could easily escape. For instance, a frog could hop far enough to  escape in a matter of seconds if released. A 73-millimeter _Rana  pipiens_ that I observed was bitten twice within one and a quarter hours  and died 45 minutes after the last bite. Its movement was uncoordinated  by the time of the second bite, but it could have escaped had the frog  not been confined. Although it is doubtful that normal, healthy fish are  frequently captured by cottonmouths, Allen (1932:17) reported that a  cottonmouth was seen pushing a small, dead pike about on the surface of  a stream. A wound on the belly of the fish indicated that it had been  bitten. A 17-gram creek chub (_Semotilus_) and a 13.7-gram bass  (_Micropterus_) were injected by me with one-fourth cubic centimeter of  fresh venom near the base of the tail in order to determine whether the  fish could escape after being bitten and released. The creek chub  flipped onto its back after a minute and 45 seconds and gill movements  stopped in eight minutes and 35 seconds; the bass flipped over after 50  seconds and died in two minutes and 10 seconds. The venom immediately  affected both fish, and it is unlikely that either could have swum more  than a few feet.    After its prey has been killed, a cottonmouth examines the body from end  to end by touching it with the tongue. Then the animal is grasped in the  mouth without the use of the fangs and is slowly manipulated until one  end (usually the head) is held in the mouth. The lengthy process of  swallowing then takes place, the fangs and lower jaws alternately  pushing the prey down the throat.      Food and Food Preferences    The cottonmouth seems to be an opportunistic omni-carnivore, because it  eats almost any type of flesh that is available, including carrion. It  feeds primarily upon vertebrates found in or near water; but  invertebrates and eggs have also been found in the diet. The only  potential prey items that seem not to be normally eaten are bufonid  toads and tadpoles. I have occasionally offered tadpoles and frogs to  cottonmouths, but only the frogs were accepted. But, Stanley Roth kept a  cottonmouth in captivity that ate both toads and tadpoles. If tadpoles  are commonly eaten, their probable rapid digestion would make  identification almost impossible.    Following is a list of known foods of the cottonmouth:         Captivity: \"... rattlesnake.... The same moccasin also killed       and ate a smaller snake of its own species....\" (Conant,       1934:382.)         Florida: \"3 heron feathers, bird bone, _Eumeces inexpectatus_,       3 fish all under one inch in length, 1 heron egg shell\" (Carr,       1936:89). According to Allen and Swindell (1948:5), \"the food       included other moccasins, prairie rattlesnakes, king-snakes,       black snakes, water snakes, garter snakes, ribbon snakes, and       horn snakes ... most of the species of frogs, baby alligators,       mice, rats, guinea pigs, young rabbits, birds, bats, squirrels,       and lizards ... a mud turtle ... a case of a four footer eating       ten to twelve chicken eggs. The most common food appears to be       fish and frogs. Catfish are included on this list....\" Yerger       (1953:115) mentions \"an adult yellow bullhead, _Ameiurus       natalis_ ... 306 mm. in standard length [from a 63-inch       cottonmouth].\"         Georgia: \"... full grown _Rana catesbeiana_, several foot-long       pickerel ... dead fish if placed in a pan of water.... _Natrix       sipedon fasciata_ and _Masticophis flagellum_ ... rats....       Toads and large _Eumeces laticeps_ were always ignored.\"       (Neill, 1947:203.) \"_Natrix_, _Heterodon_, _Kinosternon_,       _Rana_, _Hyla cinerea_, _Microhyla_, Microtine [_Pitymys       pinetorum_].\" (Hamilton and Pollack, 1955:3.)         Mississippi: \"... _Hyla gratiosa_.... In captivity specimens       have eaten frogs, mice, birds, dead fish, pigmy rattlers and       copperheads. Toads ... were refused\" (Allen, 1932:17). One       moccasin \"disgorged a smaller decapitated moccasin ... killed       the day before by boys\" (Smith and List, 1955:123).         Tennessee: \"Beetles in one stomach; lizard (_Eumeces_) in       another stomach; small snake (_Natrix_) in one intestine, and       hair in another intestine. One stomach contained numerous bits       of wood, up to four inches in length....\" (Goodman, 1958:149.)         Kentucky: \"_Siren intermedia_ was the most abundant food item       in both volume and occurrence. Frogs of the genus _Rana_ ranked       second. Together, these two items comprised almost 2/3 of the       food of the snakes. The other food items were distributed"]]]
