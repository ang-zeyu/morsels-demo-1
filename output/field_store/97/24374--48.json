With some astonishment, therefore, Jimmy found that these  revelations, so far from prejudicing the man with the revolver  against him, had apparently told in his favor. The man behind the  gun was regarding him rather with interest than disapproval.    \"So, you're a crook from London, are you?\"    Jimmy did not hesitate. If being a crook from London was a passport  into citizens' parlors in the small hours, and, more particularly,  if it carried with it also a safe-conduct out of them, Jimmy was not  the man to refuse the role. He bowed.    \"Well, you'll have to come across, now you're in New York.  Understand that! And come across good.\"    \"Sure, he will,\" said Spike, charmed that the tension had been  relieved, and matters placed upon a pleasant and business-like  footing. \"He'll be good. He's next to de game, sure.\"    \"Sure,\" echoed Jimmy, courteously. He did not understand; but things  seemed to be taking a turn for the better, so why disturb the  harmony?    \"Dis gent,\" said Spike respectfully, \"is boss of de cops. A  police-captain,\" he corrected himself.    A light broke upon Jimmy's darkness. He wondered he had not  understood before. He had not been a newspaper-man in New York for a  year without finding out something of the inner workings of the  police force. He saw now why the other's manner had changed.    \"Pleased to meet you,\" he said. \"We must have a talk together one of  these days.\"    \"We must,\" said the police-captain, significantly. He was rich,  richer than he had ever hoped to be; but he was still on Tom  Tiddler's ground, and meant to make the most of it.    \"Of course, I don't know your methods on this side, but anything  that's usual--\"    \"I'll see you at my office. Spike Mullins will show you where it  is.\"    \"Very well. You must forgive this preliminary informal call. We came  in more to shelter from the rain than anything.\"    \"You did, did you?\"    Jimmy felt that it behooved him to stand on his dignity. The  situation demanded it.    \"Why,\" he said with some hauteur, \"in the ordinary course of  business I should hardly waste time over a small crib like--\"    \"It's banks fer his,\" murmured Spike, rapturously. \"He eats dem  alive. An' jools from duchesses.\"    \"I admit a partiality for jewels and duchesses,\" said Jimmy. \"And,  now, as it's a little late, perhaps we had better--Ready, Spike?  Good-night, then. Pleased to have met you.\"    \"I'll see you at my office.\"    \"I may possibly look in. I shall be doing very little work in New  York, I fancy. I am here merely on a vacation.\"    \"If you do any work at all,\" said the policeman coldly, \"you'll look  in at my office, or you'll wish you had when it's too late.\"    \"Of course, of course. I shouldn't dream of omitting any formality  that may be usual. But I don't fancy I shall break my vacation. By  the way, one little thing. Have you any objections to my carving a  J on your front-door?\"    The policeman stared.    \"On the inside. It won't show. It's just a whim of mine. If you have  no objection?\"    \"I don't want any of your--\" began the policeman.    \"You misunderstand me. It's only that it means paying for a dinner.  I wouldn't for the world--\"    The policeman pointed to the window.    \"Out you get,\" he said, abruptly. \"I've had enough of you. And don't  you forget to come to my office.\"    Spike, still deeply mistrustful of the bull-dog Rastus, jumped at  the invitation. He was through the window and out of sight in the  friendly darkness almost before the policeman had finished speaking.  Jimmy remained.    \"I shall be delighted--\" he had begun. Then, he stopped. In the  doorway was standing a girl--a girl whom he recognized. Her startled  look told him that she, too, had recognized him.    Not for the first time since he had set out from his flat that night  in Spike's company, Jimmy was conscious of a sense of the unreality  of things. It was all so exactly as it would have happened in a  dream! He had gone to sleep thinking of this girl, and here she was.  But a glance at the man with the revolver brought him back to earth.  There was nothing of the dream-world about the police-captain.    That gentleman, whose back was toward the door, had not observed the  addition to the company. Molly had turned the handle quietly, and  her slippered feet made no sound. It was the amazed expression on  Jimmy's face that caused the captain to look toward the door.    \"Molly!\"    The girl smiled, though her face was white. Jimmy's evening clothes  had reassured her. She did not understand how he came to be there,  but evidently there was nothing wrong. She had interrupted a  conversation, not a conflict.    \"I heard the noise and you going downstairs, and I sent the dogs  down to help you, father,\" she said. \"And, then, after a little, I  came down to see if you were all right.\"    Mr. McEachern was perplexed. Molly's arrival had put him in an  awkward position. To denounce the visitor as a cracksman was now  impossible, for he knew too much. The only real fear of the  policeman's life was lest some word of his money-making methods  might come to his daughter's ears.    Quite a brilliant idea came to him.    \"A man broke in, my dear,\" he said. \"This gentleman was passing, and  saw him.\"    \"Distinctly,\" said Jimmy. \"An ugly-looking customer!\"    \"But he slipped out of the window, and got away,\" concluded the  policeman.    \"He was very quick,\" said Jimmy. \"I think he may have been a  professional acrobat.\"    \"He didn't hurt you, father?\"    \"No, no, my dear.\"    \"Perhaps I frightened him,\" said Jimmy, airily.    Mr. McEachern scowled furtively at him.    \"We mustn't detain you, Mr.-\"    \"Pitt,\" said Jimmy. \"My name is Pitt.\" He turned to Molly. \"I hope  you enjoyed the voyage.\"    The policeman started.    \"You know my daughter?\"    \"By sight only, I'm afraid. We were fellow-passengers on the  Lusitania. Unfortunately, I was in the second-cabin. I used to see  your daughter walking the deck sometimes.\"    Molly smiled.    \"I remember seeing you--sometimes.\"    McEachern burst out.    \"Then, you--!\"    He stopped, and looked at Molly. The girl was bending over Rastus,  tickling him under the ear.    \"Let me show you the way out, Mr. Pitt,\" said the policeman,  shortly. His manner was abrupt, but when one is speaking to a man  whom one would dearly love to throw out of the window, abruptness is  almost unavoidable.    \"Perhaps I should be going,\" said Jimmy.    \"Good-night, Mr. Pitt,\" said Molly.    \"I hope we shall meet again,\" said Jimmy.    \"This way, Mr. Pitt,\" growled McEachern, holding the door.    \"Please don't trouble,\" said Jimmy. He went to the window, and,  flinging his leg over the sill, dropped noiselessly to the ground.    He turned and put his head in at the window again.    \"I did that rather well,\" he said, pleasantly. \"I think I must take  up this--sort of thing as a profession. Good-night.\"          CHAPTER VIII    AT DREEVER      In the days before he began to expend his surplus energy in playing  Rugby football, the Welshman was accustomed, whenever the monotony  of his everyday life began to oppress him, to collect a few friends  and make raids across the border into England, to the huge  discomfort of the dwellers on the other side. It was to cope with  this habit that Dreever Castle, in the county of Shropshire, came  into existence. It met a long-felt want. In time of trouble, it  became a haven of refuge. From all sides, people poured into it,  emerging cautiously when the marauders had disappeared. In the whole  history of the castle, there is but one instance recorded of a  bandit attempting to take the place by storm, and the attack was an  emphatic failure. On receipt of a ladleful of molten lead, aimed to  a nicety by one John, the Chaplain (evidently one of those sporting  parsons), this warrior retired, done to a turn, to his mountain  fastnesses, and was never heard of again. He would seem, however, to  have passed the word around among his friends, for subsequent  raiding parties studiously avoided the castle, and a peasant who had  succeeded in crossing its threshold was for the future considered to  be \"home\" and out of the game.    Such was the Dreever of old. In later days, the Welshman having  calmed down considerably, it had lost its militant character. The  old walls still stood, gray, menacing and unchanged, but they were  the only link with the past. The castle was now a very comfortable  country-house, nominally ruled over by Hildebrand Spencer Poynt de  Burgh John Hannasyde Coombe-Crombie, twelfth Earl of Dreever  (\"Spennie\" to his relatives and intimates), a light-haired young  gentleman of twenty-four, but in reality the possession of his uncle  and aunt, Sir Thomas and Lady Julia Blunt.    Lord Dreever's position was one of some embarrassment. At no point  in their history had the Dreevers been what one might call a  parsimonious family. If a chance presented itself of losing money in  a particularly wild and futile manner, the Dreever of the period had  invariably sprung at it with the vim of an energetic blood-hound.  The South Sea Bubble absorbed two hundred thousand pounds of good  Dreever money, and the remainder of the family fortune was  squandered to the ultimate penny by the sportive gentleman who held  the title in the days of the Regency, when Watier's and the Cocoa  Tree were in their prime, and fortunes had a habit of disappearing  in a single evening. When Spennie became Earl of Dreever, there was  about one dollar and thirty cents in the family coffers.    This is the point at which Sir Thomas Blunt breaks into Dreever  history. Sir Thomas was a small, pink, fussy, obstinate man with a  genius for trade and the ambition of an Alexander the Great;  probably one of the finest and most complete specimens of the  came-over-Waterloo-Bridge-with-half-a crown-in-my-pocket-and-now-look-at-me  class of millionaires in existence.

A smallholder rented land of  about 30 acres from a landlord, which he paid by doing work on the  lord's demesne [land held by the one lowest in the scale of holding who  has a general right of doing with it what he pleases] land, paying  money rent, or paying a food rent such as in eggs or chickens.  Smallholders made up about two fifths of the population. A cottager had  one to five acres of land and depended on others for his living. Among  these were shepherds, ploughmen, swineherds, and blacksmiths. They also  participated in the agricultural work, especially at harvest time.            It was possible for a thegn to become an earl, probably by the  possession of forty hides. He might even acquire enough land to qualify  him for the witan. Women could be present at the witanagemot and  shiregemote [meeting of the people of the shire]. They could sue and be  sued in the courts. They could independently inherit, possess, and  dispose of property. A wife's inheritance was her own and under no  control of her husband.            Marriage required the consent of the lady and her friends. The  man also had to arrange for the foster lean, that is, remuneration for  rearing and support of expected children. He also declared the amount  of money or land he would give the lady for her consent, that is, the  morgengift, and what he would bequeath her in case of his death. It was  given to her on the morning after the wedding night. The family of the  bride was paid a \"mund\" for transferring the rightful protection they  possessed over her to the family of the husband. If the husband died  and his kindred did not accept the terms sanctioned by law, her kindred  could repurchase the rightful protection. If she remarried within a  year of his death, she had to forfeit the morgengift and his nearest  kin received the lands and possessions she had. The word for man was  \"waepnedmenn\" or weaponed person. A woman was \"wifmenn\" or wife person,  with \"wif\" being derived from the word for weaving.            Great men and monasteries had millers, smiths, carpenters,  architects, agriculturists, fishermen, weavers, embroiders, dyers, and  illuminators.            For entertainment, minstrels sang ballads about heroes or Bible  stories, harpers played, jesters joked, and tumblers threw and caught  balls and knives. There was gambling, dice games, and chasing deer with  hounds.            Fraternal guilds were established for mutual advantage and  protection. A guild imposed fines for any injury of one member by  another member. It assisted in paying any murder fine imposed on a  member. It avenged the murder of a member and abided by the  consequences. It buried its members and purchased masses for his soul.            Mercantile guilds in seaports carried out commercial  speculations not possible by the capital of only one person.            There were some ale houses, probably part of certain dwellings.            It was usual for a dying man to confess his sins to a priest.  For the sake of his soul, the priest often suggested the man give some  of his chattel to the church, the poor, or other pious uses. By the  700s, the words of a dying man giving chattel for the sake of his soul  were expected to be carried out. Later is the \"post obit gift\" by which  a man gives land to the church, with the king's consent, but enjoys the  land during his lifetime by stating in writing \"I give certain land  after my death\" in a special \"book\". The church takes possession of the  land after his death. He may make a conditional such gift, leaving the  land to his wife for her life with a rent paid to the church and the  church taking possession of the land on her death. These two procedures  coalesce into one written will used in the 800s, 900s, and 1000s. This  will also includes distributions to family and kinsmen and perhaps to  creditors. If the will is made by the very great people: kings, queens,  king's sons, bishops, earldormen, and king's thegns, it requires the  king's consent, which may be bought by a large heriot. And a bishop  usually sets his cross to the will, denouncing any who infringe it to  the torments of hell. The dead man's parish church is paid a mortuary  when he is buried.                        The Law            The special authority of the king and his peace gradually  superseded the customary jurisdiction of the local courts as to  preservation of the peace and punishment of offenses. All criminal  offenses became breaches of the king's peace and were deemed acts of  personal disobedience and made an offender the king's enemy. This  notion developed from the special sanctity of the king's house and his  special protection of his attendants and servants. An offender made  fines to the king for breach of his peace and fines and forfeitures to  him from court decisions in criminal and civil cases. Offenses  especially dealt with in various parts of the Anglo-Saxon laws were  treason, homicide, wounding, assault, and theft. Treason to one's lord,  especially to the king, was punishable by death. Compassing or  imagining the king's death was treason.    King Alfred collected regulations from various church synods and  commanded that many of them which English forefathers had observed to  be written out - those which appealed to him; and many of those that  did not appeal to him he rejected, with the consent of his Witan or  commanded them to be observed in a different way. \"These are the  regulations which the Almighty God himself spoke to Moses and ordered  him to observe and subsequently the only-born son of the Lord, our God,  that is the Savior Christ confirmed ...\":  1. Do not love other strange gods before me.  2. Do not speak My name idly, for you will not be guiltless with Me if  you idly speak My name.  3. Remember to hallow the rest-day. Work for yourselves six days, and  on the seventh day rest yourselves. For in six days, God the Father  made the heavens and the earth, the seas and all creatures that are in  them, and rested himself on the seventh day, and therefore God has  sanctified it.  4. Honour your father and your mother that God gave you so that you may  be the longer living on earth.  5. Do not kill.  6. Do not lie in sexual union secretly.  7. Do not steal.  8. Do not speak false evidence.  9. Do not wish for your neighbour's property unrightfully.  10. Do not make yourselves golden or silver gods.  11. If anyone buy a Christian slave, let him serve for six years and on  the seventh let him be free without payment. With such clothes as he  entered into service, let him leave with. If he has a wife of his own  providing, let her leave with him. If the master provided him with a  wife, both she and her children shall belong to the master. If the  slave then says `I do not want to leave my master or my wife or my  child or my property', let his master bring him to the door of the  Temple and perforate his ear with an awl as a sign that he shall ever  afterwards be a slave.  12. Though someone sell his daughter into slavery do not let her be a  slave entirely as are other maid servants. He has not the right to sell  her abroad among foreign people. But if he who bought her does not care  for her, let her be free among a foreign people. But if he i.e. the  purchaser allows his son to cohabit with her, give her the morning gift  and ensure that she has clothing and that she has the value of her  maidenhood, that is the dowry - let him give her that. If he does none  of those things for her, then she shall be free.  13. The person who slays another deliberately shall suffer death. He  that has killed another in self defense or involuntarily or  unintentionally, as God delivered him i.e. the victim into his hands  and providing he i.e. the killer did not set a trap for him - in that  case let him be worthy of his life, and of settling by customary  compensation, if he should seek asylum. If however anyone deliberately  and intentionally kills his neighbour treacherously, pluck him from my  altar so that he should suffer death.  14. He that attacks his father or his mother shall suffer death.  15. He that abducts a freeman and sell him, and it is proved so that he  cannot absolve himself, let him suffer death. He that curses his father  or his mother, let him suffer death.  16. If someone attacks his neighbour with a stone or with his fist, but  he i.e. the victim can still get about with the aid of a staff, let him  i.e. the aggressor provide him with a doctor and do his i.e. the  victim's work for him for as long as he i.e. the victim cannot himself.  17. He that attacks his own non-free servant or his maidservant, and  they are not dead as a result of the attack but live two or three days,  he i.e. the aggressor shall not be so entirely guilty, because it was  his own property he damaged. But if the slave be dead the same day,  then the guilt rests on him i.e. the aggressor.  18. If anyone in the course of a dispute injure a pregnant woman, let  him make compensation for the hurt as judges decide in his case. If she  be dead, let him give life for life.  19. If anyone put out another's eye, let him give his own for it. Tooth  for tooth. Hand for hand. Foot for foot. Burn for burn. Wound for  wound. Bruise for bruise.  20. If anyone strike the eye of his slave or maidservant out and so  makes them one-eyed, let him free them for that. If he strike out a  tooth, let him do the same.  21. If an ox gore a man or woman so that they are dead, it it be stoned  to death and do not let the flesh be eaten. The owner shall not be  liable if the ox was butting two days before that or even three and the  owner did not know of it. But if he knew of it and would not shut it  i.e. the animal in, and then it killed a man or woman, let it be stoned  to death and let the master be killed or made to pay as the Witan  consider proper. If it gore a son or daughter, let "]]]
