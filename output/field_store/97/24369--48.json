The gardens, however, immediately surrounding the Hall look  somewhat flat in comparison.    Although Henry VIII. did the principal part of his courting at Hever, it  was at Blickling that he claimed his bride, and by some accounts was  married to her there and not at Calais. The old earl, the unfortunate  queen's father, survived her only two years; and after his death the  estate was purchased by Sir Henry Hobart,[11] who built the present  noble house. Among the relics preserved at Blickling of the unhappy  queen are her morning-gown and a set of night-caps, and her toilet case  containing mirrors, combs, etc. Sir John the third baronet entertained  Charles II. and his queen here in 1671, upon which occasion the host's  son and heir, then aged thirteen, was knighted. The royal visit is duly  recorded in the parish register as follows: \"King Charles the Second,  with Queene Katherine, and James, Duke of Yorke, accompanied with the  Dukes of Monmouth, Richmond, and Buckingham, and with divers Lords,  arrived and dined at Sir John Hubart's, at Blicklinge Hall, the King,  Queene, Duke of Yorke, and Duchesse of Richmond, of Buckingham etc., in  the great dining-roomes, the others in the great parloure beneath it,  upon Michmasday 1671. From whence they went, the Queene to Norwich, the  King to Oxneads and lodged there, and came through Blicklinge the next  day about one of the clock, going to Rainham to the Lord Townsends.\"[12]    Queen Catherine slept that night and the following in the Duke's Palace  at Norwich, but joined her royal spouse at lunch at Oxnead, which fine  Elizabethan house has, alas! been pulled down, and the statues and  fountain from there are now at Blickling. \"Next morne (being Saterday),\"  writes a local scribe in 1671, \"her Maty parted so early from Norwich  as to meet ye King againe at Oxnead ere noone; Sr Robt Paston haveing  got a vast dinner so early ready, in regard that his Maty was to goe  that same afternoone (as he did) twenty myles to supper to the Ld  Townshend's, wher he stayd all yesterday, and as I suppose, is this  evening already return'd to Newmarket, extremely well satisfied with our  Lord Lieuts reception.... Her Maty haveinge but seven myles back to  Norwich that night from Sr Robt Pastons was pleased for about two  houres after dinner to divert herselfe at cards with the Court ladies  and my Lady Paston, who had treated her so well and yet returned early  to Norwich that eveninge to the same quarters as formerly; and on Sunday  morne (after her devotions perform'd and a plentifull breakfast) shee  tooke coach, extreamely satisfied with the dutifull observances of all  this countie and city, and was conducted by the Ld Howard and his  sonnes as far as Attleburough where fresh coaches atended to carry her  back to the Rt Hoble the Ld Arlington's at Euston.\"[13]    Sidelights of this royal progress are obtained from the diarist Evelyn  and Lord Dartmouth. Among the attractions provided for the king's  amusement at Euston was the future Duchess of Portsmouth. The Duchess of  Richmond (La belle Stuart), in the queen's train, must have been  reminded how difficult had been her position before she eloped with her  husband four years previously. For the duke's sake let us hope he was as  overcome as his Majesty when the latter let his tongue wag with more  than usual freedom during the feast at Raynham. \"After her marriage,\"  says Dartmouth, speaking of the duchess, \"she had more complaisance than  before, as King Charles could not forbear telling the Duke of Richmond,  when he was drunk at Lord Townshend's in Norfolk.\" Evelyn did not think  much of the queen's lodgings at Norwich, which he describes as \"an old  wretched building,\" partly rebuilt in brick, standing in the  market-place, which in his opinion would have been better had it been  demolished and erected somewhere else.    Not far from Blickling to the north-east is Mannington Hall, a mansion  built in the reign of Henry VI., which possesses one of the best  authenticated ghost stories of modern times. The story is the more  interesting as it is recorded by that learned and delightful chronicler  Dr. Jessop, chaplain to His Majesty the King. The strange experiences of  his visit in October 1879 are duly recorded in the _Athenaeeum_ of the  following January. The rest of the household had retired to rest, and  Dr. Jessop was sitting up making extracts from some rare books in an  apartment adjoining the library. Absorbed in his study, time had slipped  away and it was after one o'clock. \"I was just beginning to think that  my work was drawing to a close,\" says the doctor, \"when, as I was  actually writing, I saw a large white hand within a foot of my elbow.  Turning my head, there sat a figure of a somewhat large man, with his  back to the fire, bending slightly over the table, and apparently  examining the pile of books that I had been at work upon. The man's face  was turned away from me, but I saw his closely-cut, reddish brown hair,  his ear and shaved cheek, the eyebrow, the corner of his right eye, the  side of the forehead, and the large high cheekbone. He was dressed in  what I can only describe as a kind of ecclesiastical habit of thick  corded silk, or some such material, close up to the throat, and a narrow  rim or edging of about an inch broad of satin or velvet serving as a  stand-up collar and fitting close to the chin. The right hand, which had  first attracted my attention, was clasping, without any great pressure,  the left hand; both hands were in perfect repose, and the large blue  veins of the right hand were conspicuous. I remember thinking that the  hand was like the hand of Velasquez's magnificent 'Dead Knight' in the  National Gallery. I looked at my visitor for some seconds, and was  perfectly sure that he was a reality. A thousand thoughts came crowding  upon me, but not the least feeling of alarm or even of uneasiness.  Curiosity and a strong interest were uppermost. For an instant I felt  eager to make a sketch of my friend, and I looked at a tray on my right  for a pencil: then thought, 'Upstairs I have a sketch-book; shall I  fetch it?' There he sat and I was fascinated, afraid not of his staying,  but lest he should go. Stopping in my writing, I lifted my left hand  from the paper, stretched it out to a pile of books and moved the top  one. I cannot explain why I did this. My arm passed in front of the  figure, and it vanished. Much astonished, I went on with my writing  perhaps for another five minutes, and had actually got to the last few  words of the extract when the figure appeared again, exactly in the same  place and attitude as before. I saw the hand close to my own; I turned  my head again to examine him more closely, and I was framing a sentence  to address to him when I discovered that I did not dare to speak. I was  afraid of the sound of my own voice! There he sat, and there sat I. I  turned my head again to my work, and finished the two or three words  still remaining to be written. The paper and my notes are at this moment  before me, and exhibit not the slightest tremor or nervousness. I could  point out the words I was writing when the phantom came, and when he  disappeared. Having finished my task I shut the book and threw it on the  table: it made a slight noise as it fell--the figure vanished.\" Not  until now did the doctor feel nervous, but it was only for a second. He  replaced the books in the adjoining room, blew out the candles on the  table, and retired to his rooms marvelling at his calmness under such  strange circumstances.    [Illustration: WYMONDHAM.]    The old-fashioned town Wymondham, to the south-west of Norwich, contains  an interesting church and market-cross, and one or two fine Gothic  houses, all in good preservation. But stay, the quaint octagonal  Jacobean timber structure in the market-place was holding forth a  petition for contributions, as it was feeling somewhat decrepit. This  was six or seven years ago, so probably by now it has entered upon a new  lease of life. How much more picturesque are these old timbered  structures than the jubilee clock-towers which have sprung up in many  old-fashioned towns, putting everything out of harmony. But few towns  are proud of their old buildings. They must be up to date with flaring  red-brick, and electric tramways, and down comes everything with any  claim to antiquity, without a thought of its past associations or  picturesque value. But let us hope that Wymondham may be exempt from  these terrible tramways for many years to come, as its population is, or  was, decreasing.    The abbey and the church appear to have got rather mixed up; but having  come to a satisfactory arrangement, present a most pleasing group, and,  in the twilight, with two lofty towers and a ruined archway, it looks  far more like a castle on the Rhine than a church in Norfolk. The effect  doubtless would be heightened if we could see the rebel Kett dangling in  chains from the tower as he did in the reign of Bloody Mary. The timber  roof is exceptionally fine, with its long array of carved oak bosses and  projecting angels.    Near Wymondham is the moated Hall of Stanfield, picturesque with its  numerous pinnacles. Here the heroine of the delightful romance  _Kenilworth_ was born in 1532; but poor Amy's marriage, far from being  secret, was celebrated with great pomp at Sheen in Surrey in 1550, and  is recorded in the _Diary of Edward VI._ now in the British Museum.  \"Lydcote,\" the old house in North Devon where she lived for some  years, was pulled down not many years ago. Her bedstead from there we  believe is still preserved at Great Torrington Rectory.    [Illustration: HAUTBOYS HALL.  (_Photo by W. B. Redfern, Esq._)]    Somewhat similar to Stanfield, though now only a farmhouse, is the very  pretty old Tudor house Hautboys Hall. It stands a few miles to the  south-east of Oxnead.    Of all "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/398"],[0,"The First Book of Adam and Eve (#8)"],[1," did not make us die.    21 But now, we thought in our hearts, if we eat of the fruit of the  trees, without God's order, He will destroy us this time, and will wipe  us off from the face of the earth.    22 And if we drink of this water, without God's order, He will make an  end of us and root us up at once.    23 Now, therefore, O God, that I am come to this place with Eve, we beg  You to give us some fruit from the garden, that we may be satisfied  with it.    24 For we desire the fruit that is on the earth, and all else that we  lack in it.\"      * The medieval belief that there were only four elements--fire, earth,  air, and water--was widely accepted until about 1500 AD when the  current atomic theory was in its infancy.          Chapter XXXV - God's reply.    1 Then God looked again at Adam and his crying and groaning, and the  Word of God came to him, and said to him:--    2 \"O Adam, when you were in My garden, you knew neither eating nor  drinking; neither faintness nor suffering; neither leanness of flesh,  nor change; neither did sleep depart from thine eyes.  But since you  transgressed, and came into this strange land, all these trials are  come over you.\"          Chapter XXXVI - Figs.    1 Then God commanded the cherub, who kept the gate of the garden with a  sword of fire in his hand, to take some of the fruit of the fig-tree,  and to give it to Adam.    2 The cherub obeyed the command of the Lord God, and went into the  garden and brought two figs on two twigs, each fig hanging to its leaf;  they were from two of the trees among which Adam and Eve hid themselves  when God went to walk in the garden, and the Word of God came to Adam  and Eve and said to them, \"Adam, Adam, where are you?\"    3 And Adam answered, \"O God, here I am.  When I heard the sound of You  and Your voice, I hid myself, because I am naked.\"    4 Then the cherub took two figs and brought them to Adam and Eve.  But  he threw them to them from a distance; for they might not come near the  cherub by reason of their flesh, that could not come near the fire.    5 At first, angels trembled at the presence of Adam and were afraid of  him.  But now Adam trembled before the angels and was afraid of them.    6 Then Adam came closer and took one fig, and Eve also came in turn and  took the other.    7 And as they took them up in their hands, they looked at them, and  knew they were from the trees among which they had hidden themselves.          Chapter XXXVII - Forty-three days of penance do not redeem one hour of  sin (v. 6).    1 Then Adam said to Eve, \"Do you not see these figs and their leaves,  with which we covered ourselves when we were stripped of our bright  nature?  But now, we do not know what misery and suffering may come  over us from eating them.    2 Now, therefore, O Eve, let us restrain ourselves and not eat of them,  you and I; and let us ask God to give us of the fruit of the Tree of  Life.\"    3 Thus did Adam and Eve restrain themselves, and did not eat of these  figs.    4 But Adam began to pray to God and to beseech Him to give him of the  fruit of the Tree of Life, saying thus: \"O God, when we transgressed  Your commandment at the sixth hour of Friday, we were stripped of the  bright nature we had, and did not continue in the garden after our  transgression, more than three hours.    5 But in the evening You made us come out of it.  O God, we  transgressed against You one hour, and all these trials and sorrows  have come over us until this day.    6 And those days together with this the forty-third day, do not redeem  that one hour in which we transgressed!    7 O God, look at us with an eye of pity, and do not avenge us according  to our transgression of Your commandment, in Your presence.    8 O God, give us of the fruit of the Tree of Life, that we may eat of  it, and live, and turn not to see sufferings and other trouble, in this  earth; for You are God.    9 When we transgressed Your commandment, You made us come out of the  garden, and sent a cherub to keep the Tree of Life, lest we should eat  thereof, and live; and know nothing of faintness after we transgressed.    10 But now, O Lord, behold, we have endured all these days, and have  borne sufferings.  Make these forty-three days an equivalent for the  one hour in which we transgressed.\"          Chapter XXXVIII - \"When 5500 years are fulfilled. . . .\"    1 After these things the Word of God came to Adam, and said to him:--    2 \"O Adam, as to the fruit on the Tree of Life that you have asked for,  I will not give it to you now, but only when the 5500 years are  fulfilled.  At that time I will give you fruit from the Tree of Life,  and you will eat, and live forever, you, and Eve, and your righteous  descendants.    3 But these forty-three days cannot make amends for the hour in which  you transgressed My commandment.    4 O Adam, I gave you the fruit of the fig-tree to eat in which you hid  yourself.  Go and eat of it, you and Eve.    5 I will not deny your request, neither will I disappoint your hope;  therefore, endure until the fulfillment of the covenant I made with  you.\"    6 And God withdrew His Word from Adam.          Chapter XXXIX - Adam is cautious--but too late.    1 Then Adam returned to Eve, and said to her, \"Get up, and take a fig  for yourself, and I will take another; and let us go to our cave.\"    2 Then Adam and Eve took each a fig and went towards the cave; the time  was about the setting of the sun; and their thoughts made them long to  eat of the fruit.    3 But Adam said to Eve, \"I am afraid to eat of this fig.  I know not  what may come over me from it.\"    4 So Adam cried, and stood praying before God, saying, \"Satisfy my  hunger, without my having to eat this fig; for after I have eaten it,  what will it profit me?  And what shall I desire and ask of you, O God,  when it is gone?\"    5 And he said again, \"I am afraid to eat of it; for I know not what  will befall me through it.\"          Chapter XL - The first Human hunger.    1 Then the Word of God came to Adam, and said to him, \"O Adam, why  didn't you have this dread, or this fasting, or this care before now?  And why didn't you have this fear before you transgressed?    2 But when you came to live in this strange land, your animal body  could not survive on earth without earthly food, to strengthen it and  to restore its powers.\"    3 And God withdrew His Word for Adam.          Chapter XLI - The first Human thirst.    1 Then Adam took the fig, and laid it on the golden rods.  Eve also  took her fig, and put it on the incense.    2 And the weight of each fig was that of a water-melon; for the fruit  of the garden was much larger than the fruit of this land*.    3 But Adam and Eve remained standing and fasting the whole of that  night, until the morning dawned.    4 When the sun rose they were still praying, but after they had  finished praying, Adam said to Eve:--    5 \"O Eve, come, let us go to the border of the garden looking south; to  the place from where the river flows, and is parted into four heads.  There we will pray to God, and ask Him to give us some of the Water of  Life to drink.    6 For God has not fed us with the Tree of Life, in order that we may  not live.  Therefore, we will ask him to give us some of the Water of  Life, and to quench our thirst with it, rather than with a drink of  water of this land.\"    7 When Eve heard these words from Adam, she agreed; and they both got  up and came to the southern border of the garden, at the edge of the  river of water a short distance from the garden.    8 And they stood and prayed before the Lord, and asked Him to look at  them this once, to forgive them, and to grant them their request.    9 After this prayer from both of them, Adam began to pray with his  voice before God, and said;--    10 \"O Lord, when I was in the garden and saw the water that flowed from  under the Tree of Life, my heart did not desire, neither did my body  require to drink of it; neither did I know thirst, for I was living;  and above that which I am now.    11 So that in order to live I did not require any Food of Life, neither  did I drink of the Water of Life.    12 But now, O God, I am dead; my flesh is parched with thirst.  Give me  of the Water of Life that I may drink of it and live.    13 Of Your mercy, O God, save me from these plagues and trials, and  bring me into another land different from this, if You will not let me  live in Your garden.\"      * This is substantiated by Genesis 3:7 whereby the leaves of the fig  tree were large enough that Adam and Eve could fashion garments from  them.          Chapter XLII - A promise of the Water of Life.  The third prophecy of  the coming of Christ.    1 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him:--    2 \"O Adam, as to what you said, 'Bring me into a land where there is  rest,' it is not another land than this, but it is the kingdom of  heaven where alone there is rest.    3 But you can not make your entrance into it at present; but only after  your judgment is past and fulfilled.    4 Then will I make you go up into the kingdom of heaven, you and your  righteous descendants; and I will give you and them the rest you ask  for at present.    5 And if you said, 'Give me of the Water of Life that I may drink and  live'--it cannot be this day, but on the day that I shall descend into  hell, and break the gates of brass, and bruise in pieces the kingdoms  of iron.    6 Then will I in mercy save your soul and the souls of the righteous,  to give them rest in My garden.  And that shall be when the end of the  world is come.    7 And, again, in regards to the Water of Life you seek, it will not be  granted you this day; but on the day that I shall shed My blood on your  head* in the land of Golgotha**.    8 For My blood shall be the Water of Life to you at that time, and not  to just you alone, but to all your descendants who shall believe in  Me***; that it be to them for rest forever."]]]
