Although to some extent the soluble waste of  rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain, by far the larger  part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to  streams by springs.    In limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate  (the carbonate of lime), and where the limestone is magnesian they  contain magnesium carbonate also. Such waters are \"hard\"; when  used in washing, the minerals which they contain combine with the  fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds. When  springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with  calcium sulphate. In granite regions they contain more or less  soda and potash from the decay of feldspar.    The flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons  of the year than does that of surface streams. So slow is the  movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long  droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface  drainage.    MOVEMENTS OF GROUND WATER. Ground water is in constant movement  toward its outlets. Its rate varies according to many conditions,  but always is extremely slow. Even through loose sands beneath the  beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a  year.    In any region two zones of flow may be distinguished. The UPPER  ZONE OF FLOW extends from the ground-water surface downward  through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the  mantle rests, as far as the first impermeable layer, where the  descending movement of the water is stopped. The DEEP ZONES OF  FLOW occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the  impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface. The upper zone  is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly  seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the  slopes to the valleys, where in part it discharges in springs and  often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and  feeds the river (Fig. 24).    A city in a region of copious rains, built on the narrow flood  plain of a river, overlooked by hills, depends for its water  supply on driven wells, within the city limits, sunk in the sand a  few yards from the edge of the stream. Are these wells fed by  water from the river percolating through the sand, or by ground  water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the  sewage of the town?    At what height does underground water stand in the wells of your  region? Does it vary with the season? Have you ever known wells to  go dry? It may be possible to get data from different wells and to  draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with  the surface of the ground.    FISSURE SPRINGS AND ARTESIAN WELLS. The DEEPER ZONES OF FLOW lie in  pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum.  Such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths, and  water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface  streams and even of the sea. When a fissure crosses a water-  bearing stratum, or AQUIFIER, water is forced upward by the  pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts  of the stratum, and may reach the surface as a fissure spring. A  boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well, a  name derived from a province in France where wells of this kind  have been long in use. The rise of the water in artesian wells,  and in fissure springs also, depends on the following conditions  illustrated in Figure 29. The aquifer dips toward the region of  the wells from higher ground, where it outcrops and receives its  water. It is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water-  tight or water-logged layers beneath. The weight of the column of  water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the  well, precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces  it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings.    Which will supply the larger region with artesian wells, an  aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle? Which of  the two aquifers, their thickness being equal, will have the  larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger  amount of water from the rainfall? Illustrate with diagrams.    THE ZONE OF SOLUTION. Near the surface, where the circulation of  ground water is most active, it oxidizes, corrodes, and dissolves  the rocks through which it passes. It leaches soils and subsoils  of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend  for their food. It takes away the soluble cements of rocks; it  widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the  bedding planes; it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks,  such as rock salt, limestone, or gypsum. The work of ground water  in producing landslides has already been noticed. The zone in  which the work of ground water is thus for the most part  destructive we may call the zone of solution.    CAVES. In massive limestone rocks, ground water dissolves channels  which sometimes form large caves (Fig. 30). The necessary  conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well  shown in central Kentucky, where an upland is built throughout of  thick horizontal beds of limestone. The absence of layers of  insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free  circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural  openings in the rock. These water ways have been gradually  enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with  caves. Five hundred open caverns are known in one county.    Mammoth Cave, the largest of these caverns, consists of a  labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is  said to be as much as thirty miles. One passage four miles long  has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of  forty feet. One of the great halls is three hundred feet in width  and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet  above the floor. Galleries at different levels are connected by  well-like pits, some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five  feet from top to bottom. Through some of the lowest of these  tunnels flows Echo River, still at work dissolving and wearing  away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a  great spring.    NATURAL BRIDGES. As a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land  above it is lowered by weathering, the roof at last breaks down  and the cave becomes an open ravine. A portion of the roof may for  a while remain, forming a \"natural bridge.\"    SINK HOLES. In limestone regions channels under ground may become  so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away  through them. Ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep  to find it. Little or no surface water is left to form brooks.    Thus across the limestone upland of central Kentucky one meets but  three surface streams in a hundred miles. Between their valleys  surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes.  These are pits, commonly funnel shaped, formed by the enlargement  of crevice or joint by percolating water, or by the breakdown of  some portion of the roof of a cave. By clogging of the outlet a  sink hole may come to be filled by a pond.    Central Florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely  subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea. Sink  holes are common, and many of them are occupied by lakelets. Great  springs mark the point of issue of underground streams, while some  rise from beneath the sea. Silver Spring, one of the largest,  discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet  deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source.  About the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles.    THE KARST. Along the eastern coast of the Adriatic, as far south  as Montenegro, lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn  and honeycombed by the solvent action of water. Where forests have  been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away,  the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock  where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch  work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges. Great sink holes, some  of them six hundred feet deep and more, pockmark the surface of  the land. The drainage is chiefly subterranean. Surface streams  are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground.  Fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where  the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to  reappear some miles away. Ground water stands so far below the  surface that it cannot be reached by wells, and the inhabitants  depend on rain water stored for household uses. The finest cavern  of Europe, the Adelsberg Grotto, is in this region. Karst, the  name of a part of this country, is now used to designate any  region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of  surface and ground water. We must remember that Karst regions are  rare, and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams,  it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of  underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous  rocks in other regions.    Even when gathered into definite channels, ground water does not  have the erosive power of surface streams, since it carries with  it little or no rock waste. Regions whose underground drainage is  so perfect that the development of surface streams has been  retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action  of surface running waters, and may therefore stand higher than the  surrounding country. The hill honeycombed by Luray Cavern,  Virginia, has been attributed to this cause.    CAVERN DEPOSITS. Even in the zone of solution water may under  certain circumstances deposit as well as erode.

He said  it was very true; and then began to praise the life, and tell what a  pleasure it was to get on shore with money in his pocket, and spend it  like a man, and buy apples, and swagger, and surprise what he called  stick-in-the-mud boys. \"And then it's not all as bad as that,\" says he;  \"there's worse off than me: there's the twenty-pounders. O, laws!  you should see them taking on. Why, I've seen a man as old as you, I  dessay\"--(to him I seemed old)--\"ah, and he had a beard, too--well, and  as soon as we cleared out of the river, and he had the drug out of his  head--my! how he cried and carried on! I made a fine fool of him, I tell  you! And then there's little uns, too: oh, little by me! I tell you, I  keep them in order. When we carry little uns, I have a rope's end of  my own to wollop'em.\" And so he ran on, until it came in on me what  he meant by twenty-pounders were those unhappy criminals who were  sent over-seas to slavery in North America, or the still more unhappy  innocents who were kidnapped or trepanned (as the word went) for private  interest or vengeance.    Just then we came to the top of the hill, and looked down on the Ferry  and the Hope. The Firth of Forth (as is very well known) narrows at this  point to the width of a good-sized river, which makes a convenient ferry  going north, and turns the upper reach into a landlocked haven for all  manner of ships. Right in the midst of the narrows lies an islet with  some ruins; on the south shore they have built a pier for the service  of the Ferry; and at the end of the pier, on the other side of the road,  and backed against a pretty garden of holly-trees and hawthorns, I could  see the building which they called the Hawes Inn.    The town of Queensferry lies farther west, and the neighbourhood of the  inn looked pretty lonely at that time of day, for the boat had just gone  north with passengers. A skiff, however, lay beside the pier, with some  seamen sleeping on the thwarts; this, as Ransome told me, was the brig's  boat waiting for the captain; and about half a mile off, and all  alone in the anchorage, he showed me the Covenant herself. There was a  sea-going bustle on board; yards were swinging into place; and as the  wind blew from that quarter, I could hear the song of the sailors as  they pulled upon the ropes. After all I had listened to upon the way, I  looked at that ship with an extreme abhorrence; and from the bottom of  my heart I pitied all poor souls that were condemned to sail in her.    We had all three pulled up on the brow of the hill; and now I marched  across the road and addressed my uncle. \"I think it right to tell  you, sir,\" says I, \"there's nothing that will bring me on board that  Covenant.\"    He seemed to waken from a dream. \"Eh?\" he said. \"What's that?\"    I told him over again.    \"Well, well,\" he said, \"we'll have to please ye, I suppose. But what  are we standing here for? It's perishing cold; and if I'm no mistaken,  they're busking the Covenant for sea.\"          CHAPTER VI    WHAT BEFELL AT THE QUEEN'S FERRY    As soon as we came to the inn, Ransome led us up the stair to a small  room, with a bed in it, and heated like an oven by a great fire of coal.  At a table hard by the chimney, a tall, dark, sober-looking man sat  writing. In spite of the heat of the room, he wore a thick sea-jacket,  buttoned to the neck, and a tall hairy cap drawn down over his ears; yet  I never saw any man, not even a judge upon the bench, look cooler, or  more studious and self-possessed, than this ship-captain.    He got to his feet at once, and coming forward, offered his large hand  to Ebenezer. \"I am proud to see you, Mr. Balfour,\" said he, in a fine  deep voice, \"and glad that ye are here in time. The wind's fair, and the  tide upon the turn; we'll see the old coal-bucket burning on the Isle of  May before to-night.\"    \"Captain Hoseason,\" returned my uncle, \"you keep your room unco hot.\"    \"It's a habit I have, Mr. Balfour,\" said the skipper. \"I'm a cold-rife  man by my nature; I have a cold blood, sir. There's neither fur,  nor flannel--no, sir, nor hot rum, will warm up what they call  the temperature. Sir, it's the same with most men that have been  carbonadoed, as they call it, in the tropic seas.\"    \"Well, well, captain,\" replied my uncle, \"we must all be the way we're  made.\"    But it chanced that this fancy of the captain's had a great share in my  misfortunes. For though I had promised myself not to let my kinsman out  of sight, I was both so impatient for a nearer look of the sea, and  so sickened by the closeness of the room, that when he told me to \"run  down-stairs and play myself awhile,\" I was fool enough to take him at  his word.    Away I went, therefore, leaving the two men sitting down to a bottle  and a great mass of papers; and crossing the road in front of the inn,  walked down upon the beach. With the wind in that quarter, only little  wavelets, not much bigger than I had seen upon a lake, beat upon the  shore. But the weeds were new to me--some green, some brown and long,  and some with little bladders that crackled between my fingers. Even so  far up the firth, the smell of the sea-water was exceedingly salt and  stirring; the Covenant, besides, was beginning to shake out her sails,  which hung upon the yards in clusters; and the spirit of all that I  beheld put me in thoughts of far voyages and foreign places.    I looked, too, at the seamen with the skiff--big brown fellows, some in  shirts, some with jackets, some with coloured handkerchiefs about their  throats, one with a brace of pistols stuck into his pockets, two or  three with knotty bludgeons, and all with their case-knives. I passed  the time of day with one that looked less desperate than his fellows,  and asked him of the sailing of the brig. He said they would get under  way as soon as the ebb set, and expressed his gladness to be out of  a port where there were no taverns and fiddlers; but all with such  horrifying oaths, that I made haste to get away from him.    This threw me back on Ransome, who seemed the least wicked of that gang,  and who soon came out of the inn and ran to me, crying for a bowl of  punch. I told him I would give him no such thing, for neither he nor I  was of an age for such indulgences. \"But a glass of ale you may have,  and welcome,\" said I. He mopped and mowed at me, and called me names;  but he was glad to get the ale, for all that; and presently we were  set down at a table in the front room of the inn, and both eating and  drinking with a good appetite.    Here it occurred to me that, as the landlord was a man of that county,  I might do well to make a friend of him. I offered him a share, as was  much the custom in those days; but he was far too great a man to sit  with such poor customers as Ransome and myself, and he was leaving the  room, when I called him back to ask if he knew Mr. Rankeillor.    \"Hoot, ay,\" says he, \"and a very honest man. And, O, by-the-by,\" says  he, \"was it you that came in with Ebenezer?\" And when I had told him  yes, \"Ye'll be no friend of his?\" he asked, meaning, in the Scottish  way, that I would be no relative.    I told him no, none.    \"I thought not,\" said he, \"and yet ye have a kind of gliff* of Mr.  Alexander.\"         * Look.    I said it seemed that Ebenezer was ill-seen in the country.    \"Nae doubt,\" said the landlord. \"He's a wicked auld man, and there's  many would like to see him girning in the tow*. Jennet Clouston and mony  mair that he has harried out of house and hame. And yet he was ance  a fine young fellow, too. But that was before the sough** gaed abroad  about Mr. Alexander, that was like the death of him.\"         * Rope.         ** Report.    \"And what was it?\" I asked.    \"Ou, just that he had killed him,\" said the landlord. \"Did ye never hear  that?\"    \"And what would he kill him for?\" said I.    \"And what for, but just to get the place,\" said he.    \"The place?\" said I. \"The Shaws?\"    \"Nae other place that I ken,\" said he.    \"Ay, man?\" said I. \"Is that so? Was my--was Alexander the eldest son?\"    \"'Deed was he,\" said the landlord. \"What else would he have killed him  for?\"    And with that he went away, as he had been impatient to do from the  beginning.    Of course, I had guessed it a long while ago; but it is one thing to  guess, another to know; and I sat stunned with my good fortune, and  could scarce grow to believe that the same poor lad who had trudged in  the dust from Ettrick Forest not two days ago, was now one of the rich  of the earth, and had a house and broad lands, and might mount his horse  tomorrow. All these pleasant things, and a thousand others, crowded into  my mind, as I sat staring before me out of the inn window, and paying  no heed to what I saw; only I remember that my eye lighted on Captain  Hoseason down on the pier among his seamen, and speaking with some  authority. And presently he came marching back towards the house, with  no mark of a sailor's clumsiness, but carrying his fine, tall figure  with a manly bearing, and still with the same sober, grave expression on  his face. I wondered if it was possible that Ransome's stories could  be true, and half disbelieved them; they fitted so ill with the man's  looks. But indeed, he was neither so good as I supposed him, nor quite  so bad as Ransome did; for, in fact, he was two men, and left the better  one behind as soon as he set foot on board his vessel.    The next thing, I heard my uncle calling me, and found the pair in the  road together. It was the captain who addressed me, and that with an air  (very flattering to a young lad) of grave equality.    \"Sir,\" said he, \"Mr. Balfour tells me great things of you; and for my  own part, I like your looks. I wish I was for longer here, that we might  make the better friends; but we'll make"]]]
