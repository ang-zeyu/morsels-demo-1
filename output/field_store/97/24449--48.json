Elijah, that great zealot for purity of  worship, was so far from being offended by the high places and the  multiplicity of altars to Jehovah that their destruction brought  bitterness to his soul as the height of wickedness, and with his  own hand he rebuilt the altar that had fallen into ruins on Mount  Carmel.  And that the improvised offering on extraordinary  occasions had also not fallen into disuse is shown by the case of  Elisha, who, when his call came as he was following the plough,  hewed his oxen to pieces on the spot and sacrificed.  In this  respect matters after the building of Solomon's temple continued to  be just as they had been before.  If people and judges or kings  alike, priests and prophets, men like Samuel and Elijah, sacrificed  without hesitation whenever occasion and opportunity presented  themselves, it is manifest that during the whole of that period  nobody had the faintest suspicion that such conduct was heretical  and forbidden.  If a theophany made known to Joshua the sanctity  of Gilgal, gave occasion to Gideon and Manoah to rear altars at  their homes, drew the attention of David to the threshing-floor of  Araunah, Jehovah Himself was regarded as the proper founder of all  these sanctuaries,--and this not merely at the period of the  Judges, but more indubitably still at that of the narrator of  these legends.  He rewarded Solomon's first sacrifice on the great  Bamah at Gibeon with a gracious revelation, and cannot, therefore,  have been displeased by it.  After all this, it is absurd to speak  of any want of legality in what was then the ordinary practice;  throughout the whole of the earlier period of the history of  Israel, the restriction of worship to a single selected place was  unknown to any one even as a pious desire.  Men believed themselves  indeed to be nearer God at Bethel or at Jerusalem than at any  indifferent place, but of such gates of heaven there were several;  and after all, the ruling idea was that which finds its  most distinct expression in 2Kings v.17,--that Palestine as a whole  was Jehovah's house, His ground and territory.  Not outside of  Jerusalem, but outside of Canaan had one to sojourn far from His  presence, under the dominion and (cujus regio ejus religio) in the  service of strange gods.  The sanctity of the land did not depend  on that of the temple; the reverse was the case.  /1/    ***********************************  1. Gen. iv.14, 16: when Cain is driven out of the land (Canaan),  he is driven from the presence of Jehovah (Jonah i.3, 10).  Gen. xlvi.4: Jacob is not to hesitate about going down into Egypt,  for Jehovah will, by a special act of grace, change His dwelling-place  along with him.  Exodus xv.17: \"Thou broughtest thy people to the mountain  of thine inheritance, to the place which thou hadst prepared for  thyself to dwell in,\" the explanation which follows, \"to the  sanctuary which thy hand had established,\" is out of place, for  the mountain of the inheritance can only be the mountainous land  of Palestine.  1Samuel xxvi.19: David, driven by Saul into foreign  parts, is thereby violently sundered from his family share in  the inheritance of Jehovah, and compelled to serve other gods.  Hos. viii.1: one like an eagle comes against the house of  Jehovah, i.e., the Assyrian comes against Jehovah's land.  Hos.  ix.15: \"I will drive them out of mine house,\" i.e., the Israelites  out of their land.  Most distinct is the language of Hos. ix.3-5:  \"They shall not continue to dwell in Jehovah's land; Ephraim must  back to Egypt, and must eat that which is unclean in Assyria.  They  shall not any more offer wine-offerings to Jehovah, or set forth  offerings [read with Kuenen Y(RKW for Y(RBW ] before Him; their  bread is as the bread of mourners; whosoever eats of it is  polluted, for their bread shall be only for the staying of hunger,  and shall not be brought into the house of Jehovah.  What indeed  will ye do in the time of the solemn assembly and in the day of  the feast of Jehovah?  \"Compare Jer. xvi.13; Ezek. iv.13; Mal.  ii.11; 2Kings xvii.25 seq.  It is also possible that the \"great  indignation\" of 2Kings iii.27 is regarded less as Jehovah's than as  that of Chemosh, in whose land the army of Israel is at the time.  *******************************************    I.I.2. A change in this respect first begins to be prepared at that  important epoch of the religious history of Israel which is marked  by the fall of Samaria and the rise of the prophets connected  therewith.  Amos and Hosea presuppose a condition of matters just  such as has been described: everywhere--in the towns, on the  mountains, under green trees--a multitude of sanctuaries and  altars, at which Jehovah is served in good faith, not with the  purpose of provoking Him, but in order to gain His favour.  The  language held by these men was one hitherto unheard of when they  declared that Gilgal, and Bethel, and Beersheba, Jehovah's  favourite seats, were an abomination to Him; that the gifts and  offerings with which He was honoured there kindled His wrath  instead of appeasing it; that Israel was destined to be buried  under the ruins of His temples, where protection and refuge were  sought (Amos ix.).  What did they mean ?  It would be to  misunderstand the prophets to suppose that they took offence at  the holy places-- which Amos still calls Bamoth (vii.9), and that  too not in scorn, but with the deepest pathos--in and by  themselves, on account of their being more than one, or not being  the right ones.  Their zeal is directed, not against the places,  but against the cultus there carried on, and, in fact not merely  against its false character as containing all manner of abuses, but  almost more against itself, against the false value attached to it.  The common idea was that just as Moab showed itself to be the  people of Chemosh because it brought to Chemosh its offerings and  gifts, so Israel proved itself Jehovah's people by dedicating its  worship to Him, and was such all the more surely as its worship  was zealous and splendid; in times of danger and need, when His  help was peculiarly required, the zeal of the worshippers was  doubled and trebled.  It is against this that the prophets raise  their protest while they demand quite other performances as a  living manifestation of the relation of Israel to Jehovah.  This  was the reason of their so great hostility to the cultus, and the  source of their antipathy to the great sanctuaries, where  superstitious zeal outdid itself; it was this that provoked their  wrath against the multiplicity of the altars which flourished so  luxuriantly on the soil of a false confidence.  That the holy  places should be abolished, but the cultus itself remain as before  the main concern of religion, only limited to a single locality  was by no means their wish; but at the same time, in point of  fact, it came about as an incidental result of their teaching that  the high place in Jerusalem ultimately abolished all the other  Bamoth.  External circumstances, it must be added, contributed most  essentially towards the result.    As long as the northern kingdom stood, it was there that the main  current of lsraelite life manifested itself; a glance into the  Books of Kings or into that of Amos is enough to make this clear.  In Jerusalem, indeed, the days of David and of Solomon remained  unforgotten; yearning memories went back to them, and great  pretensions were based upon them, but with these the actual state  of matters only faintly corresponded.  When Samaria fell, Israel  shrivelled up to the narrow dimensions of Judah, which alone  survived as the people of Jehovah.  Thereby the field was left  clear for Jerusalem.  The royal city had always had a weighty  preponderance over the little kingdom, and within it, again, the  town had yielded in importance to the temple.  From the few  narratives we have relating to Judah one almost gathers an  impression as if it had no other concern besides those of the  temple; the kings in particular appear to have regarded the  charge of their palace sanctuary as the chief of all their  cares./1/    ******************************************  1. Nearly all the Judaean narratives in the Books of Kings relate  to the temple and the measures taken by the ruling princes with  reference to this their sanctuary.  **********************************************    In this way the increased importance of Judah after the fall of Samaria  accrued in the first instance to the benefit of the capital  and its sanctuary, especially as what Judah gained by the fall  of her rival was not so much political strength as an increase  of religious self-consciousness.  If the great house of God  upon Mount Zion had always overtopped the other shrines in Judah,  it now stood without any equal in all Israel.  But it was the prophets  who led the way in determining the inferences to be drawn from the change  in the face of things.  Hitherto they had principally had their eyes  upon the northern kingdom, its threatened collapse, and the  wickedness of its inhabitants, and thus had poured out their wrath  more particularly upon the places of worship there.  Judah they  judged more favourably, both on personal and on substantial  grounds, and they hoped for its preservation, not concealing their  sympathies for Jerusalem (Amos i.2).  Under the impression produced  by their discourses accordingly, the fall of Samaria was  interpreted as a judgment of God against the sinful kingdom and in  favour of the fallen house of David, and the destruction of the  sanctuaries of Israel was accepted as an unmistakable declaration  on Jehovah's part against His older seats on behalf of His  favourite dwelling on Zion.  Finally, the fact that twenty years  afterwards Jerusalem made her triumphant escape from the danger  which had proved"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47333"],[0,"Christmas Stories from French and Spanish Writers (#8)"],[1,"his beloved lived enslaved; and by this means--which may not  have been altogether poetical, but which revealed the shrewdness of  a heart as big as the top of a pine-tree--he found his way into the  palace. How his heart throbbed as he went up the stairs and into the  kitchen! The thought of being near her confused him so that more than  once his basket fell from his hand, spilling its contents down the  steps. But nowhere could he see his lady-love. He often heard the  screams of children at play, but nothing more.    The servants, because he was so little and so ugly, played many a  trick upon him. One alone, who seemed more compassionate than the  rest, gave him sweetmeats. One cold morning the cook, through pity  or through sheer wickedness perhaps, gave him a draught of wine that  was as biting and fiery as the very devil. The ragamuffin felt a warm  and delightful current run through his whole body while hot vapors  rose to his head. His legs trembled; his limp arms fell beside him in  voluptuous abandon. A stream of playful laughter rose from his heart  and gurgled from his lips; and Pacorrito held on to the wall with  both hands to keep from falling. A vigorous kick somewhat modified  his mirth, and he left the kitchen. His brain was topsy-turvy. He had  no idea where his steps were leading him. He ran along staggering and  laughing, first over cold tiles, then over smooth boarded floors,  then over soft, warm carpets. Suddenly he caught sight of an object  on the floor. He stood petrified for a second; then he uttered a roar  of pain and fell upon his knees. Heavens! There, stretched before him  like a corpse, with a crack through her alabaster brow, a broken arm,  and dishevelled locks, was the lady of his thoughts.    For a moment our hero was speechless. His voice was smothered in  his throat. He pressed the cold body to his heart and covered it  with burning kisses. The lady's eyes were open, and she gazed with  melancholy tenderness at her faithful lover, for she lived, in spite  of her wounds. Pacorrito knew it by the singular light of her calm  blue eyes, that emitted little flames of love and gratitude.    \"Señora, let me know who reduced you to this sad condition!\" he  exclaimed in pathetic and anguished tones. His pain was soon followed  by a burst of rage, and he thought of the great revenge he would take  upon the perpetrators of the iniquity. Just then he heard footsteps  approaching, so he tucked the lady under his arm and started on a  run. He went down the stairs, crossed the court, and broke into the  street. He could scarcely be said to be running; he was flying, like  a bird that has stolen grain, heard a report, and feeling itself  unhurt, determines to put the greatest possible distance between  itself and the gun. He ran past one, two, three, ten streets, till he  thought he was far enough away to be in safety, and then stopped to  rest, laying the object of his insensate tenderness upon his knees.      VII.    Night came upon him, and he welcomed with delight the soft shadows  that hid the daring act and protected his love. He examined her  injured body carefully, and concluded that the wounds were not  serious, although one might have seen her brain, had she had one,  through the opening in her skull, and the sawdust of her heart poured  out in copious streams through the rents in her breast. Her gown  was in shreds, and part of her hair had been dropped in the hasty  flight. His soul overflowed with sorrow when he realized that he had  not the money with which to meet the situation. As he had given up  his business, naturally his pockets were empty, and a loved woman,  particularly if she is in poor health, is a source of unlimited  expense. Migajas laid his hand sadly upon that part of his rags  wherein he had habitually kept his coin, but nothing was there.    \"At this critical moment,\" thought he, \"when I need a house, a bed,  a world of doctors and surgeons, an abundance of food, a bright fire  and a dressmaker, I have nothing--nothing!\"    But as he was very tired, he laid his head upon his idol's body and  fell asleep like an angel.    Then a great miracle took place. The lady began to revive, and  finally rising to her feet, showed Pacorrito a smiling countenance.  The wound had disappeared from her noble brow; her lithe form was  without a rent, her gown neat and whole. On her curled and perfumed  locks she wore a coquettish hat trimmed with minute flowers,--in a  word, she stood before him in all her beauty just as he had known her  in the show-window.    Migajas was dazzled, stupefied, dumb. He fell on his knees and  worshipped her as people do a divinity. Then she took the ragamuffin  by the hand, and in a voice clear, pure, and sweeter than the song of  the nightingale, she said to him,--    \"Pacorrito, follow me! I want to show you my gratitude, and tell you  of the sublime love with which you have inspired me. You have been  loyal, constant, generous, heroic; you have rescued me from the power  of those Vandals that tortured me. You deserve my heart and my hand.  Come, follow me! Do not be foolish; do not think you are inferior to  me because you are in rags.\"    Migajas gazed at the lady's elegant, luxurious attire and said sadly,  \"My lady, where can I go in this dress?\"    The lady did not answer; she merely led Pacorrito by the hand into a  mysterious region of shadows.    The ragamuffin soon found himself in a grand parlor brilliantly  illumined and filled with beautiful objects. The first moment of  bewilderment passed, he distinguished a thousand different figures  and statuettes, like those that peopled the shop in which he had  seen his beloved for the first time. What greatly surprised him was  to see all the fine ladies who in shimmering gowns had occupied  the show-window with his friend come forth to meet them. His lady  accepted their homage with grave and ceremonious courtesy. She seemed  to belong to a higher caste than they. Her queenly manner, her proud  though not haughty bearing, suggested dominion. She immediately  presented Pacorrito. For his part he was much confused and grew  redder than a poppy when the princess, taking his hand, said,--    \"Allow me to present to you the Señor Don Pacorrito de las Migajas,  who will honor us with his presence to-night.\"    The wings of his heart drooped, as they say, when he compared the  luxury that surrounded him with his own poverty, his rags, his  bare feet, his torn trousers upheld by a single suspender, and his  coat-sleeves cut off at the elbow.    \"I can divine your thoughts,\" said the princess, aside. \"Your dress  is not the most appropriate for a celebration like this. As a matter  of fact, you are not presentable.\"    \"Señora, that deuced tailor of mine,\" stammered Migajas, \"has been  false to his word, and--\"    \"Never mind; we will dress you here,\" said the noble lady.    The valets in this strange mansion were tiny and very comical  monkeys. Wee parrots of the kind known as perricos acted as pages,  to say nothing of a great number of paper birds. They immediately  set to work to repair, as far as it was possible, Pacorrito's  unfortunate appearance. They slipped his feet into a pair of tiny  gilded match-boxes that made the most stylish boots; they cut a  neck-cloth for him out of half a little red paper lantern and turned  an osier flower-pot into a sort of pastoral hat which they trimmed  elaborately with flowers. As Pacorrito had never been decorated,  they took a metal plate from an elegant Kepi and hung it around  his neck, by way of a decoration, and also a match-box, which was  round and looked like a watch, and the cut-glass stopper of a small  bottle of perfumery. The paper birds conceived the happy thought of  putting an ivory paper-cutter in his belt, to figure as a sword or  dagger. Thanks to these and numerous other inventions for concealing  his tatters, our friend looked so handsome that no one would have  recognized him. As he caught sight of himself in the mirror-top of a  work-box, he swelled with pride. He was radiant.      VIII.    The ball now began. A number of canaries from their respective cages  sang waltzes and _habaneras_. The cornets and the clarionets too were  very skilful in pressing their keys all by themselves; the violins  pinched their own strings; and the trumpets blew into each other.  Migajas thought this music was entrancing. It is unnecessary to say  that the princess danced with him. The other ladies found partners  among the officers of the army and the sovereigns who had left their  horses outside. Among these were Prince Bismarck, the Emperor of  Germany, and Napoleon. Migajas was beside himself with pride and  excitement. It would be impossible to describe the emotions of his  soul as he dashed into the dizzy whirls of the waltz with his beloved  in his arms. Her soft breathing and an occasional stray lock of her  golden hair caressed his cheek, tickling him gently and producing a  strange intoxication. A loving glance or a little sigh of fatigue  would every now and then put a climax to his madness.    Suddenly the monkeys appeared and announced supper. This caused a  great commotion. Migajas rejoiced greatly, for with no prejudice to  the spiritual character of his love, the poor little fellow was very  hungry.      IX.    The dining-hall was superb and the table exquisite. The china was of  the very finest manufactured for dolls, and a multitude of bouquets  showed their colors and scattered their fragrance from egg-stands  and thimbles. Pacorrito sat at the princess's right. They began to  eat. The parrots and paper birds waited upon them with such order  and rapidity that they seemed like soldiers drilling before their  general. The dishes were delicious. Everything was raw, or at all  events cold. Migajas was rather pleased with the supper at first, but  he was soon surfeited. The menu was as follows: bits of sponge cake,  turkeys"]]]
