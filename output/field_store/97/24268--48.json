[Illustration: SPRING POLE SNARE.]    B--is catch to hold down spring pole. C--is stake. D--is spring pole.  Some bend down a sapling for a spring pole, but we think the best way  is to cut and trim up a small pole about ten feet long; fasten the  big end under a root and bend it down over a crotch, stake or small  tree. Snare should be set on a summer sheep path, where it goes  through the bushes.    Stake might be driven down a foot or more back from the path, where a  branch of an evergreen bush would hang over it so as to hide it and a  string long enough from stake or trigger to snare to allow snare to  rest over path.    Of course, in making this set you will have to use care and your own  ingenuity to a great extent, to suit the requirements of the  surroundings. Another way is to find a log, tree or pole that lies  across a brook that is too wide for a fox to jump from one bank to  the other. Set snare on log, but in this case, bottom side of snare  should be only about four inches from log, as a fox will carry his  nose lower while crossing a stream on a log. If the log is near the  water, a spring pole should be used; if the log is high up from the  water, fasten snare to log by driving in a wooden pin in the side of  the log, and when the fox gets in snare he will tear around, fall off  of log and hang all right.      * * *    The following is said to be the manner in which they snare foxes in  New Brunswick: Early in the season they go into the woods in some  favorable locality and build a fence. This place is similar to what  would be constructed for partridge snaring, only of course with layer  brush, leaving a narrow opening sufficiently wide for the passage of  a fox, fixing everything just as they wish it to be later on when  ready for business, and having a spring pole at such a distance that  it can be utilized when wanted.    Take a dead hen or some kind of meat, place it in a jar, so that it  gets well tainted; that when the right time comes place the noose in  place at the opening made in the fence, fasten to the spring pole,  sprinkle a little of this tainted bait about, and await results.      [Illustration: THE RUNAWAY SNARE SET.]    In going and coming, wooden shoes or clogs are worn, so that the fox  will not get the scent of the party setting the trap.    An animal in coming down the path passes its body or neck through the  loop made of stout insulated wire; in passing it steps on the trip  stick which settles with the animal's weight, releasing the trigger,  which in turn releases the stay-wire and jerks the loop around the  animal; the spring pole onto which the stay-wire is attached lifts  your game up into the air, choking it to death and placing it out of  reach of other animals that would otherwise destroy your fur. A small  notch cut in the stay crotch where the end of the trip stick rests  will insure the trigger to be released. This will hold the trip stick  firm at the end, making it move only at the end where the animal  stops.    New and valuable methods are continually being published in the  Hunter-Trader-Trapper, an illustrated monthly magazine, of Columbus,  Ohio.        CHAPTER XI.    TRAP, SNARE, SHOOTING AND POISON.    Some say that scent is no good, and that they can trap more without  it, and they even go so far as to offer to match their craft with  those using it. I don't call myself a trapper, says E. R. Lafleche,  of Canada, as I never spend much time at hunting or trapping. When I  go in the woods it is only for a little recreation, and not being an  old hunter, I do not know it all yet, but will say that I can get  more than my share of foxes in any place here in Canada.    For the benefit of the young as well as many old trappers I will give  here my methods of trapping, snaring, shooting and poisoning the fox,  which is as good, if not better, than any I have seen. I can clean  the foxes out of any section of the country without having to  purchase any of the so-called famous scent.    To take away the human scent from whatever I do, I make a bath as  follows: First, take 2 lbs. of male cedar branches, 2 lbs. balsam  branches, and 1 lb. good hen manure; chop the branches fine and place  the whole in a pot in 2 gallons of soft water, \"fresh rain water is  the best\" and boil until reduced to 1 1/2 gallon. Second, take a  clean pail or tub, smoke it with birch or balsam bark, then place  solution, cover and keep in a temperate place. To make the scent,  take equal parts of the following: Fresh eel, honey in comb, chicken,  pig liver, mice; chop the whole together like mince meat and bottle,  cork and place the bottle in a pail or tub of water so that it will  float and in a warm place. A good way is to place the bottle in some  shallow part of a lake, creek or river much exposed to the sun, and  where the water is warm; use a strong bottle and fill about  three-fourths of it, and remove the cork from time to time for fear the  fermentation smashes the bottle, and as soon as it has settled, cork  well and keep in a temperate place for a week or so, and it is ready  for use.    Smear your snowshoes and go where you like, and there will not be a  single fox that will come to your trail that will not follow it to  the end.    To take the iron smell from traps, first clean them well in warm  water. Second, put them in the bath for 10 or 12 hours. Third, smoke  them with birch and balsam bark; then they are ready to set, Place  the trap 18 inches from the bait and put a few drops of the medicine  under the pan of the trap, get a small shovel made of sieve wire, and  sieve some snow over the trap and over your signs up to three feet or  more from your bait. Don't spit or monkey with pipe and tobacco.  Place your bait near a large stone, stump, fence or tree, and in such  a way that the fox will be able to approach the bait from side where  the trap is; always set the trap so that the loose jaw will be at the  far end from the bait.      [Illustration: SOME CANADIAN REDS.]    It is a good thing to place some clean white cotton wool under the  pan with a few drops of the scent. As soon as a fox is caught save a  front leg and with it print some signs such as a live fox would do,  all over the place where the trap is set; also save the urine from  the bladder of the fox and when it becomes rancid, sprinkle a few  drops on the weeds near the trap and the first fox that will come  will be yours.    To poison them strychnine is required. First, use fresh beef suet and  make pills the size of a big pea. Second, put the size of a large  grain of wheat of strychnine and stick these pills in your bait the  same way as garlic in a roast. Third, take a fresh cow head, stick  your pills in the fleshy parts of the head, but do not place them too  close to each other, then hang the head out of the reach of the hens,  etc., in a stable where there is cattle for one night, then take it  to the place you wish to leave it and there throw away like a lost  head. A good way to place such bait is on a good sized lake. Place  the head in the center of it and you will find your fox every time.    Of course when you are using poison you must visit your bait every  morning at daylight, so that the drifting snow, etc., will not cover  the fox's tracks. While visiting the bait, keep to one side and from  three to five feet from it; don't monkey around it, and if Mr. Fox  came to the bait and if you have reason to think he has taken a pill,  make a circuit of a 100 yards or more until you come to the trail of  a fox going away from the bait. As soon as a fox feels the effect of  the poison he will make several long jumps and then start to walk.    Follow his tracks, and the moment you notice zigzags in the tracks,  or that the fox is looking for an easy place to go through a fence,  etc., this is a sure sign that the fox is sick, and you can follow  that track and find the fox. Sometimes you will find them not 50  yards from the bait, and other times a half or three-quarters of a  mile from the bait. This depends upon the time spent at the bait and  is also due to other causes.    A good way to poison them is to place a pill in a mouse or a small  piece of liver, but I prefer to make pills with lard, about a square  inch, and I insert the poison in the middle of the bullet. To do  this, I bore a small hole with a stick, and then place the strychnine  and cover the hole with the lard taken from it. To do this with ease,  the lard must be partly frozen, smear with honey and keep frozen;  then take some frozen liver (any kind will do) and chop it in fine  pieces and mix with honey and keep in a small wood box. Smoke the box  the same as the traps and smear inside with honey and add a few drops  of the medicine. The kind of box I recommend is one 4\"x12\" made of  either cedar or bass wood 1/4 inch thick, with two compartments, one  4\"x8\" for the liver pieces and the other 4\"x4\" for the bullets, with  a sliding door at each end, and a piece of leather held by small  screws on the top for the hand.    When ready, take your ammunition and once on fox land, smear your  snow shoes with the scent and at every hundred yards drop a few bits  of liver, and at every 500 yards or so, a few more with a pill, and  in the pill stick a four inch black feather, and two feet to the  right stick a strong weed, and in such a way that the wind will not  throw it down. This will enable you to find the pill in case of a  snow storm, and by brushing the snow lightly with your mit, the pill  can be found at once, unless a fox took it. If the bullet has not  been touched you can tell without having to remove the snow, as the  feather will stand straight up, and this is a sure sign that the  poison is still there. If no feather can be seen and if it has been  stormy, brush the snow away, the lard is not as white as the snow and  is easily "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#8)"],[1,"the trap at the  entrance. I noticed a hole near the creek that emptied into the river  and I set a trap at the hole. I have noticed that hole for several  years and had been seeing a large mink on that creek for eight or ten  years. I have seen his track where he would go in that hole every  time he would go along by it, but when I set my traps there I didn't  see any tracks. The next time I went there I found a large brown mink  in my trap, but it wasn't the \"big one.\"    I didn't get any more there for some time, neither had I seen the big  mink track since I set my traps down there, but on going to my traps  one morning I saw that something was doing. When I came close I saw  that there was something big in the trap and had dragged the trap  back in the hole the full length of the chain. I took hold of the  chain and began to pull. I soon pulled him out as far as his hind  legs and he looked so big I let go the chain and he went back in the  hole. I pulled him out and put a 22 between his eyes and that settled  him. He measured thirty-two and a half inches from tip to tip on the  board. How is this for a large mink, brother trappers?        CHAPTER X.    NORTHERN METHODS.    As for sets, I think it all depends upon the country and seasons. For  mink in my country, Ontario, I prefer a hollow tree turned up at the  roots, setting a No. 1 trap, baited with either fish or muskrat. Such  a set should be on the bank of a lake or river, as a hungry mink  going along the shore is always running in such old roots and logs.  As for water sets, they keep freezing up, and another thing, it is  not natural for a piece of meat to be hanging on a string.    A Michigan trapper writes as follows: Now brother trappers, are you  energetically putting in your leisure time during September and  October looking up new grounds for hunting and trapping and finding  signs and trails of coon, mink and fox, or are you lounging around  and putting all this off till it is time to take out your line of  traps?    September and October is the time to ascertain where the game is, and  if you wish success and good sport and increased revenue, it is to  your interest to do a little hustling and by watching their moves in  your neighborhood. I have made mink trapping a specialty and for  twenty-five years I have been successful in trapping him, and it did  not take me long to appreciate one point, that is, I was up against a  little animal of almost human intelligence, and today this animal is  as smart and as shy as they ever were.      [Illustration: CAUGHT IN MINNESOTA.]    There are three rules very essential in trapping any kind of animals,  one of the secrets of success is to know how, where and when to set a  trap. Another is to get a dependable trap, which in my estimation is  a Newhouse No. 1 and No. 2. I use these traps for every purpose from  a weasel to a large coon. The third one I never vary from, and that  is to set every trap as carefully as possible, as though it was  intended to catch a shy mink or coon, as one of those animals will  often happen around when one least expects it.    It is best to set a trap in good shape and always take time and  conceal each trap carefully. I have before now set traps all around  in wood and field for skunk. I have gone the rounds to my skunk traps  and found a fine big coon or weasel instead of a skunk, or to my rat  traps and found a large mink or raccoon instead of a rat, and these  lucky surprises occurred because my traps were well set and  concealed.    I will not outline my method how to set, but you may bet your old hat  you will take Mr. Coon or Mink, or whatever animal happens along in  your neighborhood, and you know where their trails are. From October  until trapping time look for their signs and tracks along water edge,  in woods, in old roads, cow paths in woods, pastures and fields, and  under fences, keeping all these places in mind until the time for  trapping comes. Then take with you lots of traps, then you know where  to set.    Smoke your traps before setting, handle everything with gloves on,  cultivate the habit of leaving the place with as little change as  possible, and finish the job by brushing away your tracks immediately  around the traps. Then visit your traps regularly and without any  unnecessary company.    Trappers often notice that fur bearing animals have disappeared from  the localities where once they were numerous. There are many reasons  for this disappearance, the destruction of their dens or trees in  which they live. No true trapper will cut a coon tree or dig out dens  of mink, skunk or fox, if he wishes to ever trap on the same ground  again.    Now I am not a professional trapper, says a Minnesota trapper, but I  make all animal habits a very close study, and love to be among them  in their wild homes and love to set a trap once in a while just for  experience, and never fail to get my game.    The other day I went rabbit hunting. We have about two inches of  fresh snow. I got one rabbit and found a fresh mink track so I  concluded to follow him. Inside of a hundred yards I found another  hole where he came out dragging something. I still followed. Another  fifty yards further I found where he went in another hole (it was in  a bog) and found a muskrat half eaten up and a fine place to set two  traps.    I had no traps with me, so I marched home about four miles and got  two traps all rusted up and tied with a piece of copper wire. I  greased them up with sewing machine oil and started back. When I got  to the place it was getting dark and I had to set the traps by match  light.    I will tell you how I set the traps to fool the mink so he could not  smell the traps or machine oil. I took the muskrat and rubbed all  over the traps with the bloody side and set the traps one in each  hole, and took an oak leaf and smeared blood on and laid it on the  pan of each trap, and then laid the muskrat in the center of the two  so he would have to cross either trap to get the rat. I then covered  the hole up with the same dirt and moss that I dug out, and went  home. At five o'clock the next morning I left home to get my prize.    I got there by daylight and there was Mr. Mink caught in both traps,  one on each foot. He was the largest mink I got that winter. He was  brown and when stretched measured exactly thirty-five inches from tip  to tip.    I almost always trap mink in the winter with blind sets, says a  Wisconsin trapper, by chopping a place for the trap so it will be,  when set, about level with the surface of the mink's trail in front  of the holes that the mink makes in the snow. I then take cat tails  that grow in the marshes and spread some on trap bed; I then place my  trap and next some more cat tails spread on top of trap, and last  some snow which I spread over it all with a twig carefully so it will  be nice and smooth. The cat tail I spread under the trap is to keep  the trap from freezing fast at the bottom. I have had very good  success with this set. I used to use bait altogether, but very few  mink can now be caught around here with bait.    I once set a trap for a mink alongside of a log which lay across the  stream, setting the trap on shore near the ice while standing on the  log; there was about 20 inches of snow on the ground, so it left a  space behind the trap in which I placed a piece of rabbit. The next  morning I should have had a mink but instead of that the mink had  that piece of rabbit, and a larger hole alongside the log showed that  it had been dragged further back under the snow. I then set my trap  again, tying fast another piece of rabbit, but Mr. Mink had enough  rabbit for a while, so about five days afterwards I had a squirrel in  it.    I then threw the rabbit away and put the squirrel in the snow along  the side and above the trap, with only the tail out of the snow.  About three days more and something had happened. The trap laid  sprung in the place I had set it and in it was the tip of a  squirrel's tail, and the squirrel I had laid for bait was gone. This  might seem untrue but it is only too true, although just how it might  have happened I cannot account for.    I then kicked up the snow and found that the mink had come from under  the ice on the other side of the log and circled the end of the log,  coming in behind the trap after the bait, all the way traveling under  the snow. I have never gotten that mink, but have learned better ways  since that time, and find that where mink are trapped much the blind  set is by far the best.        CHAPTER XI.    UNUSUAL WAYS.    We can hardly approve of some of the methods herein described, but  they will doubtless continue to be employed so long as they are not  prohibited by law. Occasionally too, there might be circumstances to  justify resorting to the most objectionable of them, writes a trapper  and hunter of Maine.    The first of those I shall speak of requires a good dog, one that  will follow the mink's track and drive him to hole. Nearly any  intelligent dog, with a fair amount of the hunting instinct, can soon  be trained to do this by allowing him to smell a few mink carcasses  while skinning, and calling his attention at every opportunity to the  trails of the animals along the streams, following them up and making  an effort to bag the mink, with his help, as often as possible. The  first snows afford good conditions for the rudimentary training, as  the trail can then be plainly seen by the trapper (or rather hunter  as he should be styled in this case) while a good scent is left for  the dog.    Having qualified the dog for tracking, the next requisite is a  partner. This, of course, means a division of the profits, but is  unavoidable, as the work cannot be performed satisfactory by one  alone. Indeed, it will more often be found convenient to have yet a  third hand, which may be a boy to manage the dog and assist  generally.      [Illus"]]]
