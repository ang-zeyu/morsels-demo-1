Rob Acquires New Powers      \"I have seen the folly of sending you into the world with an offensive  instrument, yet with no method of defense,\" resumed the Demon,  presently.  \"You have knocked over a good many people with that tube  during the past week.\"    \"I know,\" said Rob; \"but I couldn't help it.  It was the only way I had  to protect myself.\"    \"Therefore my next gift shall be this Garment of Protection.  You must  wear it underneath your clothing.  It has power to accumulate and  exercise electrical repellent force.  Perhaps you do not know what that  means, so I will explain more fully.  When any missile, such as a  bullet, sword or lance, approaches your person, its rush through the  air will arouse the repellent force of which I speak, and this force,  being more powerful than the projective force, will arrest the flight  of the missile and throw it back again.  Therefore nothing can touch  your person that comes with any degree of force or swiftness, and you  will be safe from all ordinary weapons.  When wearing this Garment you  will find it unnecessary to use the electric tube except on rare  occasions.  Never allow revenge or animosity to influence your conduct.  Men may threaten, but they can not injure you, so you must remember  that they do not possess your mighty advantages, and that, because of  your strength, you should bear with them patiently.\"    Rob examined the garment with much curiosity.  It glittered like  silver, yet was soft and pliable as lamb's wool.  Evidently the Demon  had prepared it especially for his use, for it was just Rob's size.    \"Now,\" continued the Demon, more gravely, \"we approach the subject of  an electrical device so truly marvelous that even I am awed when I  contemplate the accuracy and perfection of the natural laws which guide  it and permit it to exercise its functions.  Mankind has as yet  conceived nothing like it, for it requires full knowledge of electrical  power to understand even its possibilities.\"    The Being paused, and drew from an inner pocket something resembling a  flat metal box.  In size it was about four inches by six, and nearly an  inch in thickness.    \"What is it?\" asked Rob, wonderingly.    \"It is an automatic Record of Events,\" answered the Demon.    \"I don't understand,\" said Rob, with hesitation.    \"I will explain to you its use,\" returned the Demon, \"although the  electrical forces which operate it and the vibratory currents which are  the true records must remain unknown to you until your brain has  mastered the higher knowledge of electricity.  At present the practical  side of this invention will be more interesting to you than a review of  its scientific construction.    \"Suppose you wish to know the principal events that are occurring in  Germany at the present moment.  You first turn this little wheel at the  side until the word 'Germany' appears in the slot at the small end.  Then open the top cover, which is hinged, and those passing events in  which you are interested will appear before your eyes.\"    The Demon, as he spoke, opened the cover, and, looking within, the boy  saw, as in a mirror, a moving picture before him.  A regiment of  soldiers was marching through the streets of Berlin, and at its head  rode a body of horsemen, in the midst of which was the Emperor himself.  The people who thronged the sidewalks cheered and waved their hats and  handkerchiefs with enthusiasm, while a band of musicians played a  German air, which Rob could distinctly hear.    While he gazed, spell-bound, the scene changed, and he looked upon a  great warship entering a harbor with flying pennants.  The rails were  lined with officers and men straining their eyes for the first sight of  their beloved \"VATERLAND\" after a long foreign cruise, and a ringing  cheer, as from a thousand throats, came faintly to Rob's ear.    Again the scene changed, and within a dingy, underground room, hemmed  in by walls of stone, and dimly lighted by a flickering lamp, a body of  wild-eyed, desperate men were plighting an oath to murder the Emperor  and overthrow his government.    \"Anarchists?\" asked Rob, trembling with excitement.    \"Anarchists!\" answered the Demon, with a faint sneer, and he shut the  cover of the Record with a sudden snap.    \"It's wonderful!\" cried the boy, with a sigh that was followed by a  slight shiver.    \"The Record is, indeed, proof within itself of the marvelous  possibilities of electricity.  Men are now obliged to depend upon  newspapers for information; but these can only relate events long after  they have occurred.  And newspaper statements are often unreliable and  sometimes wholly false, while many events of real importance are never  printed in their columns.  You may guess what an improvement is this  automatic Record of Events, which is as reliable as Truth itself.  Nothing can be altered or falsified, for the vibratory currents convey  the actual events to your vision, even as they happen.\"    \"But suppose,\" said Rob, \"that something important should happen while  I'm asleep, or not looking at the box?\"    \"I have called this a Record,\" replied the Demon, \"and such it really  is, although I have shown you only such events as are in process of  being recorded.  By pressing this spring you may open the opposite  cover of the box, where all events of importance that have occurred  throughout the world during the previous twenty-four hours will appear  before you in succession.  You may thus study them at your leisure.  The various scenes constitute a register of the world's history, and  may be recalled to view as often as you desire.\"    \"It's--it's like knowing everything,\" murmured Rob, deeply impressed  for perhaps the first time in his life.    \"It IS knowing everything,\" returning the Demon; \"and this mighty gift  I have decided to entrust to your care.  Be very careful as to whom you  permit to gaze upon these pictures of passing events, for knowledge may  often cause great misery to the human race.\"    \"I'll be careful,\" promised the boy, as he took the box reverently  within his own hands.    \"The third and last gift of the present series,\" resumed the Demon, \"is  one no less curious than the Record of Events, although it has an  entirely different value.  It is a Character Marker.\"    \"What's that?\" inquired Rob.    \"I will explain.  Perhaps you know that your fellow-creatures are more  or less hypocritical.  That is, they try to appear good when they are  not, and wise when in reality they are foolish.  They tell you they are  friendly when they positively hate you, and try to make you believe  they are kind when their natures are cruel.  This hypocrisy seems to be  a human failing.  One of your writers has said, with truth, that among  civilized people things are seldom what they seem.\"    \"I've heard that,\" remarked Rob.    \"On the other hand,\" continued the Demon, \"some people with fierce  countenances are kindly by nature, and many who appear to be evil are  in reality honorable and trustworthy.  Therefore, that you may judge  all your fellow-creatures truly, and know upon whom to depend, I give  you the Character Marker.  It consists of this pair of spectacles.  While you wear them every one you meet will be marked upon the forehead  with a letter indicating his or her character.  The good will bear the  letter 'G,' the evil the letter 'E.'  The wise will be marked with a  'W' and the foolish with an 'F.'  The kind will show a 'K' upon their  foreheads and the cruel a letter 'C.'  Thus you may determine by a  single look the true natures of all those you encounter.\"    \"And are these, also, electrical in their construction?\" asked the boy,  as he took the spectacles.    \"Certainly.  Goodness, wisdom and kindness are natural forces, creating  character.  For this reason men are not always to blame for bad  character, as they acquire it unconsciously.  All character sends out  certain electrical vibrations, which these spectacles concentrate in  their lenses and exhibit to the gaze of their wearer, as I have  explained.\"    \"It's a fine idea,\" said the boy; \"who discovered it?\"    \"It is a fact that has always existed, but is now utilized for the  first time.\"    \"Oh!\" said Rob.    \"With these gifts, and the ones you acquired a week ago, you are now  equipped to astound the world and awaken mankind to a realization of  the wonders that may be accomplished by natural forces.  See that you  employ these powers wisely, in the interests of science, and do not  forget your promise to exhibit your electrical marvels only to those  who are most capable of comprehending them.\"    \"I'll remember,\" said Rob.    \"Then adieu until a week from to-day, when I will meet you here at this  hour and bestow upon you the last three gifts which you are entitled to  receive.

Both  dramas were acted, but without success. The Carmagnola, when it was  given at Florence in 1828, had the open support of the court to offset  the attacks of the old school, and yet did not win even a mildly  enthusiastic hearing. The Adelchi was tried with a similar result at  Turin.    In spite of their ill reception on the stage, both of Manzoni's dramas  were immensely popular with readers, and, although based on incidents  remote in point of time, both thrilled with a patriotism that stirred  the hearts of all Italians. Mr. Howells says of the tragedies in his  \"Modern Italian Poets,\" \"The time of the Carmagnola is the fifteenth  century; that of the Adelchi the eighth century; and however strongly  marked are the characters,--and they are very strongly marked, and  differ widely from most persons of Italian classic tragedy in this  respect,--one still feels that they are subordinate to the great  contests of elements and principles for which the tragedy furnishes a  scene. In the Carmagnola the pathos is chiefly in the feeling embodied  by the magnificent chorus lamenting the slaughter of Italians by  Italians at the battle of Maclodio; in the Adelchi we are conscious of  no emotion so strong as that we experience when we hear the wail of the  Italian people, to whom the overthrow of their Longobard oppressors by  the Franks is but the signal of a new enslavement. This chorus is almost  as fine as the more famous one in the Carmagnola, both are incomparably  finer than anything else in the tragedies and are much more dramatic  than the dialogue. It is in the emotion of a spectator belonging to our  own time rather than in that of an actor of those past times that the  poet shows his dramatic strength, and whenever he speaks abstractly for  country and humanity he moves us in a way that permits no doubt of his  greatness.\"    Manzoni's greatest work, however, was yet to appear, for admirable as  were his poems and inspiring as were his heroic dramas it was as a  novelist that he was to reach his pinnacle of fame. It was also as a  novelist that he was to become one of the men who directly created that  national spirit which made modern Italy. Italy had had many poets, but  no great novelist since Boccaccio. Fortunately Manzoni had not been  confined to the literature of his own land, but had studied Goethe,  Shakespeare, Voltaire, and Scott, and drew his inspiration largely from  them. He owed much to the English novel, and especially to the author  of \"Waverley,\" a man whom he much admired, and who fully returned his  admiration.    \"I Promessi Sposi\" appeared in 1825 and created a tremendous  impression. Scott said that it was the greatest historical novel ever  written, and Goethe said, \"It satisfies us like perfectly ripe fruit.\"  It was the first and greatest Italian romance, and it awakened an  interest throughout Europe in Italian history. The scene is laid in  Milan under the harsh Spanish rule of the Seventeenth Century, and  the reader is carried through the story of war and famine, and the  great plague. Its merits are hard to exaggerate, the beauty of its  descriptions and the accuracy of its history, the intense interest of  its characters, a galaxy that embraces every walk of life, the truth  of its philosophy are equally remarkable. The universal feelings of  humanity pulse through its pages; as Dr. Garnett says of it, \"as a  picture of human nature the book is above criticism; it is just the  fact, neither more nor less.\"    Victor Hugo in \"Les Miserables\" wrote a book which appealed to the  innate democracy of man, but Manzoni in \"I Promessi Sposi\" made the same  appeal without having recourse to the Frenchman's use of the grotesque  and gigantic. Through the whole of the latter novel runs the note of  a profound sympathy with the poor and the unfortunate, a note which  is perhaps stronger in this book than in any romance ever written. It  is the work of a great mind, fully alive to every sensibility and  sympathy, accurate in its judgments, and to which, in the ancient words,  nothing human is foreign.    Cardinal and priest, brigand and simple hero, grande dame and the lovely  girl whose hand promised in marriage gives part title to the book, are  each perfect in their way, and bring the characteristics of a past  century vividly before the present. Goethe pointed out the too great  prominence of the historical element, but the very careful attention  paid by Manzoni to the accuracy of his setting must add to the sense of  reality which he so completely gains. The novel was rapidly translated  into all modern languages, and at once created a school of historical  novelists in Italy.    To us who have seen the romantic movement give place in turn to that of  realism, it is difficult to understand what Scott and Hugo, Goethe and  Manzoni did for the men of the first quarter of the Nineteenth Century.  They made people feel as they had not felt before the wide scope of  existence and the importance of the individual. Literature had been a  matter of form and convention, of classic model, of purely aristocratic  vision. The new movement was part of that same impulse which was  demanding constitutions of kings and bringing the middle classes into  political prominence. It was an awakening of public spirit which had  slept soundly through several centuries. Voltaire and Rousseau,  Alfieri and Foscolo had sounded the first notes of a new intellectual  renaissance, and now Hugo and Manzoni went further and stepped boldly  out from all classic restraints.    Although \"I Promessi Sposi\" is more widely known and more highly  regarded than any Italian book, except the Divine Comedy of Dante,  Manzoni's personality impressed itself but little upon his age. He  had not the fighting nature of Victor Hugo, nor the mental unrest of  Byron, two of his great contemporaries. He preferred the retirement of  his farm to the excitements of Milan, and although he was always an  ardent advocate of Italian unity and freedom he took but small part in  the great events that soon delivered Lombardy from Austria. After the  appearance of \"I Promessi Sposi\" he wrote little more. \"Formerly,\" he  said, \"the muse came after me, now I should have to go after her.\" His  quiet life laid him open to the charge of an indifferent patriotism, but  those who knew him best understood that such an accusation was bitterly  untrue.    When the Austrian government returned to Milan the members of the  Lombard nobility were required to write their names in an official  register or forfeit their titles. Manzoni preferred to lose his claim  as a patrician, and later refused a decoration, saying that he had  made a vow never to wear any order of knighthood. He afterwards offered  the same excuse to Victor Emmanuel when the latter wished to decorate  him. He was elected a Senator in 1860, when the first National Assembly  met, and went to Turin to take his seat, but soon after retired to the  privacy of his own home on Lake Maggiore. Here he entertained many great  guests, among them Cavour and D'Azeglio, to whom he was warmly attached.  His life flowed on an even current, the existence of a philosophic  spirit interested as an observer rather than as an actor.    Henriette Manzoni died in 1833, and in 1837 he married Teresa Borri,  widow of Count Stampa. He saw his children grow up about him and go to  take their places in the world. Gradually he saw the cause of national  freedom win its way, and the King to whom he was so devoted unite the  scattered states under one crown. He saw the fall of the temporal power  of the Pope, and with it the consummation of his hopes. In 1873, at  the age of eighty-eight, he died, universally mourned and revered. A  Milanese journal said: \"After the confessor left the room Manzoni called  his friends and said to them, 'When I am dead, do what I did every day;  pray for Italy--pray for the king and his family--so good to me!' His  country was the last thought of this great man dying, as in his whole  long life it had been his most vivid and constant affection.\"    It was nearly fifty years since his last important work had appeared,  but during that long half century of inactivity Manzoni's fame had  grown steadily. His romance had passed through one hundred and eighteen  editions in Italian alone. Milan decreed him a state funeral, and  representatives of all European countries appeared at the old Lombard  capital with addresses from their sovereigns. It has been said that  Manzoni's death evoked a greater unanimity of sentiment than has been  called forth by that of any other great author of modern times, except  possibly by that of Sir Walter Scott. Even those who had criticised  Manzoni had always spoken their opinions in a spirit of reverence.  He was regarded as the great guiding figure in the course of the new  national literature.    A singularly uneventful life for one of the great builders of a nation,  uneventful even for that of a scholar or poet. Moreover the roll of  his works is small numerically, comprising his Sacred Hymns, the two  dramas, the Ode on Napoleon, the single novel, and in addition only a  few essays, the \"Innominata\" or Column of Infamy, an historical note to  \"I Promessi Sposi,\" an essay on the Romantic School, called \"Letters  on Romanticism,\" and one entitled \"Letters on the Unity of Time and  Place,\" the purpose of which was to show that the unity of action is the  only unity of importance to the dramatist. The bulk of his work was not  great, but each expression of it was masterful in its way, the Hymns  true poetry as well as deep religious sentiment, the Ode considered  the finest ode in all Italian poetry, the dramas pulsing with life and  feeling, the novel unsurpassed. These were the literary values of his  work, but these in themselves would not account for Manzoni's influence  on his times. He was a moral and political force, showing the"]]]
