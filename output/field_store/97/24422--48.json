Take an invention that hasn't been very  successful.\"    \"Well, I don't like to boast,\" said Tom with a smile, \"but all of  my inventions have been successful. They don't need any aid from  Mr. Peters, thank you.\"    \"But this one!\" went on the visitor eagerly, \"this one about some  new kind of telephone,\" and he motioned to the drawings on the  table. \"Has that been a success? Excuse me for having looked at  the plans, but I did not think you would mind. Has that telephone  been a success? If it has not perhaps Mr. Peters could form a  company to--\"    \"How did you know those drawings referred to a telephone?\" asked  Tom, suspiciously, for the papers did not make it clear just what  the invention was.    \"Why, I understood--I heard, in fact, that you were working on a  new photo telephone, and--\"    \"Who told you?\" asked Tom quickly.    \"Oh, no one in particular. The colored man who sent me here  mentioned--\"    \"Eradicate!\" thought Tom. \"He must have been talking. That isn't  like him. I must look into this.\"    Then to his caller he said:    \"Really, you must excuse me, Mr. Boylan, but I don't care to do  any business with Mr. Peters. Tell him, with my thanks, that there  is really nothing doing in his line. I prefer to exploit my own  inventions.\"    \"That is your last word?\"    \"Yes,\" returned Tom, as he gathered up the drawings.    \"Well,\" said Mr. Boylan, and Tom could not help thinking there was  a veiled threat in his tones, \"you will regret this. You will be  sorry for not having accepted this offer.\"    \"I think not,\" replied Tom, confidently. \"Good-day.\"    The young inventor sat for some time thinking deeply, when his  visitor had gone. He called Eradicate to him, and gently  questioned the old colored man, for Eradicate was ageing fast of  late, and Tom did not want him to feel badly.    It developed that the servant had been closely cross-questioned by  Mr. Boylan, while he was waiting for Tom, and it was small wonder  that the old colored man had let slip a reference to the photo  telephone. But he really knew nothing of the details of the  invention, so he could have given out no secrets.    \"But at the same time,\" mused Tom, \"I must be on guard against  these fellows. That Boylan seems a pretty slick sort of a chap. As  for Peters, he's a big 'bluff,' to be perfectly frank. I'm glad I  had Mr. Damon's warning in mind, or I might have been tempted to  do business with him.\"    \"Now to get busy at this photo telephone again. I'm going to try a  totally different system of transmission. I'll use an alternating  current on the third wire, and see if that makes it any better.  And I'll put in the most sensitive selenium plate I can make. I'm  going to have this thing a success.\"    Tom carefully examined the drawings of his invention, at which  papers Mr. Boylan had confessed to looking. As far as the young  inventor could tell none was missing, and as they were not  completed it would be hard work for anyone not familiar with them  to have gotten any of Tom's ideas.    \"But at the same time I'm going to be on my guard,\" mused Tom.  \"And now for another trial.\"    Tom Swift worked hard during the following week, and so closely  did he stick to his home and workshop that he did not even pay a  visit to Mr. Damon, so he did not learn in what condition that  gentleman's affairs were. Tom even denied himself to his chum Ned,  so taken up was the young inventor with working out the telephone  problem, until Ned fairly forced himself into the shop one day,  and insisted on Tom coming out.    \"You need some fresh air!\" exclaimed Ned. \"Come on out in the  motor boat again. She's all fixed now; isn't she?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Tom, \"but--\"    \"Oh, 'but me no buts,' as Mr. Shakespeare would say. Come on, Tom.  It will do you good. I want a spin myself.\"    \"All right, I will go for a little while,\" agreed Tom. \"I am  feeling a bit rusty, and my head seems filled with cobwebs.\"    \"Can't get the old thing to come out properly; eh?\"    \"No. I guess dad was more than half right when he said it couldn't  be done. But I haven't given up. Maybe I'll think of some new plan  if I take a little run. Come along.\"    They went down to the boat house, and soon were out on the lake in  the Kilo.    \"She runs better since you had her fixed,\" remarked Ned.    \"Yes, they did a good job.\"    \"Did you sue Peters?\"    \"Didn't have to. He sent the money,\" and Tom told of his interview  with Mr. Boylan. This was news to Ned, as was also the financial  trouble of Mr. Damon.    \"Well,\" said the young banker, \"that bears out what I had heard of  Peters--that he was a get-rich-quick chap, and a good one to steer  clear of.\"    \"Speaking of steering clear,\" laughed Tom, \"there he is now, in  his big boat,\" and he pointed to a red blur coming up the lake.  \"I'll give him a wide enough berth this time.\"    But though Mr. Peters, in his powerful motor boat, passed close to  Tom's more modest craft, the big man did not glance toward our  hero and his chum. Nor did Mr. Boylan, who was with his friend,  look over.    \"I guess they've had enough of you,\" chuckled Ned.    \"Probably he wishes he hadn't paid me that money,\" said Tom. \"Very  likely he thought, after he handed it over, that I'd be only too  willing to let him manage one of my inventions. But he has another  guess coming.\"    Tom and Ned rode on for some distance, thoroughly enjoying the  spin on the lake that fine Summer day. They stopped for lunch at a  picnic resort, and coming back in the cool of the evening they  found themselves in the midst of a little flotilla of pleasure  craft, all decorated with Japanese lanterns.    \"Better slow down a bit,\" Ned advised Tom, for many of the  pleasure craft were canoes and light row boats. \"Our wash may  upset some of them.\"    \"Guess you're right, old man,\" agreed Tom, as he closed the  gasoline throttle, to reduce speed. Hardly had he done so than  there broke in upon the merry shouts and singing of the pleasure-seekers  the staccato exhaust of a powerful motor boat, coming directly  behind Tom's craft.    Then came the shrill warning of an electrical siren horn.    \"Somebody's in a hurry,\" observed Tom.    \"Yes,\" answered Ned. \"It sounds like Peters's boat, too.\"    \"It is!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Here he comes. He ought to know better  than to cut through this raft of boats at that speed.\"    \"Is he headed toward us?\"    \"No, I guess he's had enough of that. But look at him!\"    With undiminished speed the burly promoter was driving his boat  on. The big vibrating horn kept up its clamor, and a powerful  searchlight in front dazzled the eyes.    \"Look out! Look out!\" cried several.    Many of the rowers and paddlers made haste to clear a lane for the  big, speedy motor craft, and Peters and his friends (for there  were several men in his boat now) seemed to accept this as a  matter of course, and their right.    \"Somebody'll be swamped!\" exclaimed Ned.    Hardly had he spoken than, as the big red boat dashed past in a  smother of foam, there came a startled cry in girls' voices.    \"Look!\" cried Tom. \"That canoe's upset! Speed her up, Ned! We've  got to get 'em!\"            CHAPTER IX    A GLEAM OF HOPE      \"Where are they?\"    \"Who are they?\"    \"Over this way! There's their canoe!\"    \"Look out for that motor boat!\"    \"Who was it ran them down? They ought to be arrested!\"    These were only a few of the cries that followed the upsetting of  the frail canoe by the wash from the powerful red boat. On Tom's  Kilo there was a small, electrical searchlight which he had not  yet switched on. But, with his call to Ned Newton to speed up the  motor, that had been slowed down, Tom, with one turn of his  fingers, set the lamp aglow, while, with the other hand, he  whirled the wheel over to head his craft for the spot where he saw  two figures struggling in the water.    Fortunately the lanterns on the various canoes and row-boats, as  well as the light on the bow of Tom's Kilo, made an illumination  that gave the rescuers a good chance to work. Many other boats  besides Tom's had headed for the scene, but his was the more  practical, since the others--all quite small ones--were pretty  well filled.    \"There they are, Ned!\" Tom suddenly cried. \"Throw out the clutch!  I'll get 'em!\"    \"Want any help?\"    \"No, you stay at the engine, and mind what I say. Reverse now!  We're going to pass them!\"    Ned threw in the backing gear, and the screw churned the water to  foam under the stern of the Kilo.    Tom leaned over the bow, and made a grab for the gasping,  struggling figure of a girl in the water. At the same time he had  tossed overboard a cork life ring, attached to a rope which, in  turn, was made fast to the forward deck-cleat. \"Grab that!\" cried  Tom. \"Hold on, and I'll have you out in a second! That's enough,  Ned! Shut her off!\"    The Kilo came to a standstill, and, a second later, Tom had pulled  into his boat one of the girls. She would have collapsed, and  fallen in a heap on the bottom boards, had not Ned, who had come  forward from the engine, caught her.    Then Tom, again leaning over the side, pulled in the other girl,  who was clinging to the life ring.    \"You're"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4544"],[0,"The Cell of Self-Knowledge : seven early English mystical treatises printed (#8)"],[1,"of  comfort in this life? Why hast thou not mind of thy sins? What  supposest thou of thyself, wretched sinner? Is it not enough to  thee, trowest thou not, that thou art escaped by the mercy of our  Lord from everlasting damnation? Therefore thou shouldest be well  apaid,[131] wretch, though thou suffer all the pains and darkness of  thy soul all the days of thy life. Why art thou, then, heavy and  sorrowful to suffer such pains, sith by God's grace thou shalt  escape endless pains with Christ Jesu without any doubt, and be  comforted endlessly, if thou bear these pains patiently. Whether  hast thou chosen to serve our Lord only for the comfort that thou  mayst have of Him in this life? Nay, but for the comfort that thou  shalt have of Him in the bliss of heaven. Therefore arise up now,  and cease never of thy ghostly exercise that thou hast used, but  rather increase to them more.\"    Here is an answer by the which she had a final victory of the fiend,  after long threats of intolerable pains:    \"I have chosen pain for my refreshing, and therefore it is not hard  to me to suffer them, but rather delectable for the love of my  Saviour, as long as it pleaseth His Majesty that I shall suffer  them.\"    Here is a doctrine of the said virgin, how we should use the grace  of our Lord:    \"Who so could use the grace of our Lord, he should ever have the  victory of all things that falleth to him. For as often,\" she said,  \"as any new thing falleth to a man, be it of prosperity or  adversity, he should think in himself thus: Of this will I win  somewhat. For he that can do so, shall soon be rich in virtue.\"    Here followeth notable doctrines of this holy maid, taken of her  sermon which she made to her disciples before her passing, and the  first was this:    \"What so ever he be that cometh to the service of God, if he will  have God truly, it is needful to him that he make his heart naked  from all sensible love, not only of certain persons but of every  creature what that ever he be, and then he should stretch up his  soul to our Lord and our Maker, simply, with all the desire of his  heart. For an heart may not wholly be given to God, but if it be  free from all other love, open and simple without doubleness.\" And  so she affirmed of herself, that it was her principal labour and  business from her young age unto that time, ever for to come to that  perfection. Also she said that she knew well that to such a state of  perfection, in the which all the heart is given to God, a soul may  not come perfectly without meditation of devout prayer, and that the  prayer be grounded in meekness, and that it come not forth and  proceed by any trust of any manner of virtue of him that prayeth,  but alway he should know himself to be right nought. For she said  that that was ever her business, to give herself to the exercise of  prayer, so for to win the continual habit of prayer; for she did see  well that by prayer all virtues are increased, and made mighty and  strong; and, without prayer, they wax feeble and defail.[132]  Wherefore she induced her disciples that they should busy them to  prayer perseverauntly; and therefore she told them of two manner of  prayers:[133] Vocal and Mental. Vocal prayers, she said, should be  kept certain hours in the night and in the day ordained by holy  Church; but mental prayer should ever be had, in act or in habit of  the soul. Also she said that, by the light of quick faith, she saw  clearly and conceived in her soul that what that ever befell to her,  or to any others, all cometh from God, not for hate but for great  love that He hath to His creatures; and by[134] this quick faith she  conceived in herself a love and a readiness to obey as well to the  precepts of her sovereigns,[135] as to the commandments of God, ever  thinking that their precepts should come from God, either for need  of herself, or else for increase of virtue in her soul. Also she  said, for to get and purchase purity of soul, it were right  necessary that a man kept himself from all manner of judgments of  his [neighbour, and from all idle speaking of his][136] neighbour's  deeds; for in every creature we should behold only the will of God.  And therefore she said that in no wise men should deem[137]  creatures; that is, neither despise them by their doom[138] nor  condemn them, all be it that they see them do open sin before them;  but rather they should have compassion on them and pray for them,  and despise them not, nor condemn them. Also she said that she had  great hope and trust in God's providence; for, she said, she knew  well[139] by experience that the Divine providence was and is a  passing great thing, for it wanteth never to them that hopeth in it.    DEO GRATIS          III.    HERE BEGINNETH A SHORT TREATISE OF CONTEMPLATION TAUGHT BY OUR LORD  JESU CHRIST, OR TAKEN OUT OF THE BOOK OF MARGERY KEMPE, ANCRESS OF  LYNN      SHE desired many times that her head might be smitten off with an  axe upon a block for the love of our Lord Jesu. Then said our Lord  Jesu in her mind: \"I thank thee, daughter, that thou wouldest die  for My love; for as often as thou thinkest so, thou shalt have the  same meed in heaven, as if thou suffredest the same death, and yet  there shall no man slay thee.    \"I assure thee in thy mind, if it were possible for Me to suffer  pain again, as I have done before, Me were lever to suffer as much  pain as ever I did for thy soul alone, rather than thou shouldest  depart from Me everlastingly.    \"Daughter, thou mayst no better please God, than to think  continually in His love.\"    Then she asked our Lord Jesu Christ, how she should best love Him.  And our Lord said: \"Have mind of thy wickedness, and think on My  goodness.    \"Daughter, if thou wear the habergeon or the hair,[140] fasting  bread and water, and if thou saidest every day a thousand Pater  Nosters, thou shalt[141] not please Me so well as thou dost when  thou art in silence, and suffrest Me to speak in thy soul.    \"Daughter, for to bid many beads, it is good to them that can not  better do, and yet it is not perfect.[142] But it is a good way  toward perfection. For I tell thee, daughter, they that be great  fasters, and great doers of penance, they would that it should be  holden the best life.[143] And they that give them unto many  devotions, they would have that the best life. And those that give  much almesse, they would that it were holden the best life. And I  have often told thee, daughter, that thinking, weeping, and high  contemplation is the best life in earth, and thou shalt have more  merit in heaven for one year thinking in thy mind than for an  hundred year of praying with thy mouth; and yet thou wilt not  believe Me, for thou wilt bid many beads.[144]    \"Daughter, if thou knew how sweet thy love is to Me, thou wouldest  never do other thing but love Me with all thine heart.    \"Daughter, if thou wilt be high with Me in heaven, keep Me alway in  thy mind as much as thou mayst, and forget not Me at thy meat; but  think alway that I sit in thine heart and know every thought that is  therein, both good and bad.    \"Daughter, I have suffered many pains for thy love; therefore thou  hast great cause to love Me right well, for I have bought thy love  full dear.\"    \"Dear Lord,\" she said, \"I pray Thee, let me never have other joy in  earth, but mourning and weeping for Thy love; for me thinketh, Lord,  though I were in hell, if I might weep there and mourn for Thy love  as I do here, hell should not noye[145] me, but it should be a  manner of heaven. For Thy love putteth away all manner of dread of  our ghostly enemy; for I had lever be there, as long as Thou  wouldest, and please Thee, than to be in this world and displease  Thee; therefore, good Lord, as Thou wilt, so may[146] it be.\"    She had great wonder that our Lord would become man, and suffer so  grievous pains, for her that was so unkind a creature to Him. And  then, with great weeping, she asked our Lord Jesu how she might best  please Him; and He answered to her soul, saying: \"Daughter, have  mind of thy wickedness, and think on My goodness.\" Then she prayed  many times and often these words: \"Lord, for Thy great goodness,  have mercy on my great wickedness, as certainly as I was never so  wicked as Thou art good, nor never may be though I would; for Thou  art so good, that Thou mayst no better be; and, therefore, it is  great wonder that ever any man should be departed from Thee without  end.\"    When she saw the Crucifix, or if she saw a man had a wound, or a  beast, or if a man beat a child before her, or smote a horse or  another beast with a whip, if she might see it or hear it, she  thought she saw our Lord beaten or wounded, like as she saw in the  man or in the beast.    The more she increased in love and in devotion, the more she  increased in sorrow and contrition, in lowliness[147] and meekness,  and in holy dread of our Lord Jesu, and in knowledge of her own  frailty. So that if she saw any creature be punished or sharply  chastised, she would think that she had been more worthy to be  chastised than that creature was, for her unkindness against God.  Then would she weep for her own sin, and for compassion of that  creature.    Our Lord said to her: \"In nothing that thou dost or sayest,  daughter, thou mayst no better please God than believe that He  loveth thee. For, if it were possible that I might weep with thee, I  would weep with thee for the compassion that I have of thee.\"    Our merciful Lord Jesu Christ drew this creature unto His love, and  to the mind of His passion, that she might not endure to behold a  leper, or another sick man, specially if he had any wounds appearing  on him. So she wept as if she had seen our Lord Jesu with His wounds  bleeding; and so she did, in the sight of the soul; for, through the  beholding of the sick man, her mind was all ravished in to our Lord  Jesu, that she had great mourning"]]]
