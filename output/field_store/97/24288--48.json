The whole strength  and value, then, of human judgment, depending on the one property, that  it can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on it only  when the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand. In the  case of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, how  has it become so? Because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his  opinions and conduct. Because it has been his practice to listen to all  that could be said against him; to profit by as much of it as was just,  and expound to himself, and upon occasion to others, the fallacy of what  was fallacious. Because he has felt, that the only way in which a human  being can make some approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is by  hearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety of  opinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every  character of mind. No wise man ever acquired his wisdom in any mode but  this; nor is it in the nature of human intellect to become wise in any  other manner. The steady habit of correcting and completing his own  opinion by collating it with those of others, so far from causing doubt  and hesitation in carrying it into practice, is the only stable  foundation for a just reliance on it: for, being cognisant of all that  can, at least obviously, be said against him, and having taken up his  position against all gainsayers--knowing that he has sought for  objections and difficulties, instead of avoiding them, and has shut out  no light which can be thrown upon the subject from any quarter--he has a  right to think his judgment better than that of any person, or any  multitude, who have not gone through a similar process.    It is not too much to require that what the wisest of mankind, those who  are best entitled to trust their own judgment, find necessary to warrant  their relying on it, should be submitted to by that miscellaneous  collection of a few wise and many foolish individuals, called the  public. The most intolerant of churches, the Roman Catholic Church, even  at the canonisation of a saint, admits, and listens patiently to, a  \"devil's advocate.\" The holiest of men, it appears, cannot be admitted  to posthumous honours, until all that the devil could say against him is  known and weighed. If even the Newtonian philosophy were not permitted  to be questioned, mankind could not feel as complete assurance of its  truth as they now do. The beliefs which we have most warrant for, have  no safeguard to rest on, but a standing invitation to the whole world to  prove them unfounded. If the challenge is not accepted, or is accepted  and the attempt fails, we are far enough from certainty still; but we  have done the best that the existing state of human reason admits of; we  have neglected nothing that could give the truth a chance of reaching  us: if the lists are kept open, we may hope that if there be a better  truth, it will be found when the human mind is capable of receiving it;  and in the meantime we may rely on having attained such approach to  truth, as is possible in our own day. This is the amount of certainty  attainable by a fallible being, and this the sole way of attaining it.    Strange it is, that men should admit the validity of the arguments for  free discussion, but object to their being \"pushed to an extreme;\" not  seeing that unless the reasons are good for an extreme case, they are  not good for any case. Strange that they should imagine that they are  not assuming infallibility, when they acknowledge that there should be  free discussion on all subjects which can possibly be _doubtful_, but  think that some particular principle or doctrine should be forbidden to  be questioned because it is _so certain_, that is, because _they are  certain_ that it is certain. To call any proposition certain, while  there is any one who would deny its certainty if permitted, but who is  not permitted, is to assume that we ourselves, and those who agree with  us, are the judges of certainty, and judges without hearing the other  side.    In the present age--which has been described as \"destitute of faith, but  terrified at scepticism\"--in which people feel sure, not so much that  their opinions are true, as that they should not know what to do without  them--the claims of an opinion to be protected from public attack are  rested not so much on its truth, as on its importance to society. There  are, it is alleged, certain beliefs, so useful, not to say indispensable  to well-being, that it is as much the duty of governments to uphold  those beliefs, as to protect any other of the interests of society. In a  case of such necessity, and so directly in the line of their duty,  something less than infallibility may, it is maintained, warrant, and  even bind, governments, to act on their own opinion, confirmed by the  general opinion of mankind. It is also often argued, and still oftener  thought, that none but bad men would desire to weaken these salutary  beliefs; and there can be nothing wrong, it is thought, in restraining  bad men, and prohibiting what only such men would wish to practise.  This mode of thinking makes the justification of restraints on  discussion not a question of the truth of doctrines, but of their  usefulness; and flatters itself by that means to escape the  responsibility of claiming to be an infallible judge of opinions. But  those who thus satisfy themselves, do not perceive that the assumption  of infallibility is merely shifted from one point to another. The  usefulness of an opinion is itself matter of opinion: as disputable, as  open to discussion, and requiring discussion as much, as the opinion  itself. There is the same need of an infallible judge of opinions to  decide an opinion to be noxious, as to decide it to be false, unless the  opinion condemned has full opportunity of defending itself. And it will  not do to say that the heretic may be allowed to maintain the utility or  harmlessness of his opinion, though forbidden to maintain its truth. The  truth of an opinion is part of its utility. If we would know whether or  not it is desirable that a proposition should be believed, is it  possible to exclude the consideration of whether or not it is true? In  the opinion, not of bad men, but of the best men, no belief which is  contrary to truth can be really useful: and can you prevent such men  from urging that plea, when they are charged with culpability for  denying some doctrine which they are told is useful, but which they  believe to be false? Those who are on the side of received opinions,  never fail to take all possible advantage of this plea; you do not find  _them_ handling the question of utility as if it could be completely  abstracted from that of truth: on the contrary, it is, above all,  because their doctrine is \"the truth,\" that the knowledge or the belief  of it is held to be so indispensable. There can be no fair discussion of  the question of usefulness, when an argument so vital may be employed on  one side, but not on the other. And in point of fact, when law or public  feeling do not permit the truth of an opinion to be disputed, they are  just as little tolerant of a denial of its usefulness. The utmost they  allow is an extenuation of its absolute necessity, or of the positive  guilt of rejecting it.    In order more fully to illustrate the mischief of denying a hearing to  opinions because we, in our own judgment, have condemned them, it will  be desirable to fix down the discussion to a concrete case; and I  choose, by preference, the cases which are least favourable to me--in  which the argument against freedom of opinion, both on the score of  truth and on that of utility, is considered the strongest. Let the  opinions impugned be the belief in a God and in a future state, or any  of the commonly received doctrines of morality. To fight the battle on  such ground, gives a great advantage to an unfair antagonist; since he  will be sure to say (and many who have no desire to be unfair will say  it internally), Are these the doctrines which you do not deem  sufficiently certain to be taken under the protection of law? Is the  belief in a God one of the opinions, to feel sure of which, you hold to  be assuming infallibility? But I must be permitted to observe, that it  is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call  an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that  question _for others_, without allowing them to hear what can be said on  the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the  less, if put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. However  positive any one's persuasion may be, not only of the falsity, but of  the pernicious consequences--not only of the pernicious consequences,  but (to adopt expressions which I altogether condemn) the immorality and  impiety of an opinion; yet if, in pursuance of that private judgment,  though backed by the public judgment of his country or his  contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence,  he assumes infallibility. And so far from the assumption being less  objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or  impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal. These  are exactly the occasions on which the men of one generation commit  those dreadful mistakes, which excite the astonishment and horror of  posterity. It is among such that we find the instances memorable in  history, when the arm of the law has been employed to root out the best  men and the noblest doctrines; with deplorable success as to the men,  though some of the doctrines have survived to be (as if in mockery)  invoked, in defence of similar conduct towards those who dissent from  _them_, or from their received interpretation.

Over this  again a velvet fall was turned back from the front or shaped as in the  illustration, reaching to the shoulder. These falls were also bound into  set-out shapes, which gave many picturesque effects.    Dress had now taken a new phase, and the set bodice became a lasting  feature. At this period the waist was rather short, and the neck,  arranged in a low square or round form, generally filled in with  gathered lawn. The upper part of the sleeve was often divided from the  bodice by ties with lawn puffs, and was made in a full circular form,  slashed or puffed and banded, with a tight-fitting sleeve on the  forearm. Another type divided the upper and lower part of the arm at the  shoulder and elbow, the forearm being effectively tied or laced, and  the under lawn sleeve pulled through; small slashings are also seen on  these. At times a bell-shaped sleeve was worn, showing a slashed or  puffed under one. Many dresses were still cut in one, and were often  high-necked; with these usually a girdle or band of drapery was worn,  and some skirts opened up the front, showing a rich underskirt.    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Sixteenth century, 2nd quarter.]    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--Period Henry VIII.]    Full skirts, heavily pleated at the waist, were worn in the earlier part  of this reign, banded in varying widths of designs to about the knee;  but a new development was in progress--a stiff, bell-shaped dress, set  on hoops over a rich underskirt which usually bore a jewelled band down  the centre, the upper one being divided in front to display this  feature. The bodice with this type becomes longer in the waist, and was  made on a stiff corset. Gloves are occasionally seen, serrated at the  cuff-end. Shoes of the slashed character and square toes were also worn  by the ladies, but many preferred a shoe with a moderately rounded toe.    The first mention of a leather umbrella is 1611, but this is a rare  instance, as they were not in use till the 18th century here, though  they are noted in continental prints during the 17th century.    [Illustration: FIG. 42.--Sixteenth-century modes, 1st half Henry VIII.]      SIXTEENTH CENTURY. HENRY VIII. MALE.    The modes at the end of the last century now developed into a heavier  character of design. The long hair soon began to be closely cut, and a  short beard came into fashion. A flat type of hat was worn, with  serrated brim, or tabs which could be turned down at times, and others  were kept in place by a lacing cord through holes. There was also a flat  \"Tam o' Shanter\" shape, generally worn well tilted on one side, and  amongst the upper classes mostly adorned with feathers.    The =V=-shaped collar, or opening to the belt, was still retained on the  jerkin, and plain or pleated skirts are seen, also a square  close-fitting vest, with a low square neck, filled with gathered lawn,  or one with a high neck and short collar, on which a very small ruff  appeared for the first time, and at the wrist as well. These were now  decorated with long slashes or gathered puffs: heraldic design was still  seen on the breast, and even parti-colour was worn, but this  character was now treated more by decorating with coloured bands on the  tunics or tights.    [Illustration: Plate X.--        (_a_) Black Velvet Bodice. 1600-25.      (_b_) Five Embroidered Waistcoats. Between 1690 and 1800.    _Pattern, see p. 292._]    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Period Henry VIII.]    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Cap shapes. Period Henry VIII.]    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Variety of shapes and slashing. Henry VIII.]    Long coats were still worn of the shape described at the end of the 15th  century, but a short surcoat was the mode, reaching just below the knee,  sleeveless, or with the various hanging sleeves of this period, the  fronts usually turned back to form a wide collar, either round or square  in shape on the shoulder, or at times falling to a deep square at the  back.    The sleeves were full in the upper part, tightening to the wrist,  sometimes open up to the elbow and laced, or they were pleated into a  full round shape at the shoulder. Puffs and slashings increased in these  designs, and by 1520 we find the sleeves mostly divided into puffed and  slashed forms, which grew to fantastic proportions.    Very short, tight breeches or trunks, with a front flap or codpiece,  were decorated to match the body design and colour schemes; they  increased in length to the knee, or just below, during this reign, and  usually finished in a serrated roll.    [Illustration: Plate XI.--16 Leather Boots and Shoes. Between 1535 and  1860.         1. 1740-1780.       2. 1535-1550.       3. 1680-1700.       4. 1645-1690.       5. 1665-1685.       6. 1690-1710.       7. 1845-1860.       8. 1790-1820.       9. 1665-1670.      10. 1800-1820.      11. 1820-1840.      12.     \"      13. 1815-1850.      14. 1760-1780.      15. 1650-1670.      16. 1630-1660.]    [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Footwear, 1510-1540.]    Shoes were of the square form, some very short in front, held on by a  strap across the instep, others with fronts to the instep. The  corners were often brought out to a point on each side of the toes, and  the mode of decorating with slashing and punctures made them very  interesting. The sides of these shoes are very low, from 3/4 to 1 inch,  and no heels are seen. A big, round shape was also favoured, which  increased in width till a proclamation forbade it exceeding 6 inches.  Chains were still a decorative feature round the neck, and the belt  carried a sword and pouch, or, amongst the working classes, other  necessities.      SIXTEENTH CENTURY. THE REIGNS OF EDWARD VI AND MARY.    FEMALE.    In the reign of Edward VI, which was so short, as also in that of Mary,  there was little time to form a real character. These reigns form  developing links to the Elizabethan era, so I have taken them in one  chapter.    [Illustration: FIG. 47.    FIG. 48.    FIG. 49.    Elizabethan modes.]    [Illustration: FIG. 50.--Costumes, 1554-1568.]    [Illustration: FIG. 51.--Costumes, 1568-1610.]    With Edward VI the same shaped cap is seen as that of Henry VIII, and  with Mary's accession, the head-dress is curved to the head in a like  manner, but it now became more of a hat form and took a brim curved in  on the brow; this was often worn over the little tight curved cap,  or showed the hair waved out at the sides, often netted with gold and  pearls. A fall of velvet, silk, or veiling was still retained till the  very high ruff or collar came in the Elizabethan days. A small-crowned  hat, with a brooch and feather in front, and a full gathered crown came  in before Elizabeth's time, when we see many eccentric shapes, such as  the tall hat with a feather at the side, and the witch-like hats towards  the end of her reign.    The bodice, which became longer in the first reign, still retained the  full belled oversleeve or the full puffed sleeve to the end of Mary's  reign, also the same square neck shape with curved-up front, now often  filled with silk quilted with pearls up to the neck. High-necked dresses  set with a small ruff became general in Mary's reign. We also find a  tight sleeve gathered in a circular puff at the shoulder or set in a  rolled epaulet.    The same shaped skirt of the hooped bell form (sometimes very pleated in  Mary's reign) or divided in front to show the underskirt as described  under Henry VIII, was worn.    The short square shape and the heavy round shoe is seen in Mary's  reign, but fashion then preferred a rather pointed oval shoe, well up  the instep with higher sides, decorated with characteristic slashing.  Gloves are seen in many portraits up to this period, but of a plain make  minus embroidery, and a circular fan of feathers was carried.      SIXTEENTH CENTURY. THE REIGNS OF EDWARD VI AND MARY. MALE.    With Edward VI and Mary a more refined and sober type of style set in.  The hair was now worn short and combed backwards. The flat hat of the  earlier shapes lasted to Elizabeth's reign; becoming smaller in width,  with a turned-down, curved brim and a fuller crown encircled with a gold  band or set with a feather worn at the right-hand side. A small  tight-fitting round hat with a rolled brim and a feather in front is  also of this later mode. Through these reigns a small square turned-over  collar or a very small ruff set on a high collar came into use, which  increased to a larger ruff in Mary's reign. A small ruff was also worn  at the wrist, many of these were edged with black-stitch designs. The  heavy puffed sleeves became tight and started from a small epaulet or  puffed roll; some of these had a small cuff at the wrist or a frill.  Braided designs became very elaborate on a close-fitting, padded, and  round-shaped jerkin with a short skirt, which appeared in the first  reign, and this skirt was often long enough to fasten just under the  codpiece. Short trunks at times worn half-way down the thigh were  slashed, banded, and puffed for decoration. No parti-colour was now worn  or striped effects on tights, except amongst the soldiers in the reign  of Mary. Short capes to the length of the trunks of a plain round form  sloping from the shoulders, or a square type with a high square collar  and loose sleeves, are seen; a tunic also of the earlier character with  a =V=-shaped collar and full sleeve comes into this reign, and we note the  earlier types of shoes mingling with the newer pointed oval-shaped shoe  which now continued for the remainder of this century.    [Illustration: FIG. 52.--Costumes, 1554-1580.]    [Illustration: FIG. 53.--Costumes, 1570-1605.]    In Mary's reign the round-shaped doublet began to protrude from the  breast to the waist in a round form with slightly longer skirts or small  tabs, while the trunks assumed large circular proportions and were  sometimes set on tight knee-breeches.
