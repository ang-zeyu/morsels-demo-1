[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38428"],[0,"Through a Microscope (#8)"],[1," it  pleases you better, call them 'witches dancing round the charmed pot.'\"    When the tide is out you will frequently notice barnacles adhering to  the rocks, or to the timbers used in the construction of wharves. Pray  stop and examine them critically and see what admirable fishers they  are. Their fishing-nets are composed of several long, flexible, jointed  fingers, thickly beset with sensitive hairs. When the fisher wants a  meal he thrusts his long hand (_Fig. 3_) out the door of his stone  house; the sensitive fingers quickly tell when they come in contact with  anything good to eat, and they curl over and grasp it and convey it to  the mouth.    These barnacles are wonderful creatures and well worthy your continuous  study. They pass through several stages. When young they are a gay  rolicking set, swimming freely in the water; but as maturity approaches  they settle down in stone houses, never more to rove about, and set up  fishing for a living.      XII.--RHIZOPODS.    Rhizopods are the lowest creatures in the animal kingdom. Some of them  are apparently nothing more than animated protoplasm. Protoplasm  pertains to the first formation of living bodies, whether vegetable or  animal, and it appears to be only a viscid, glutinous, unformed mass of  jelly-like substance, yet these rhizopods seem endowed with something  more than simple life.      [Illustration: FIG. 1. AMOEBA PRINCEPS, IN DIFFERENT FORMS.]    Let us take the lowest of these lowly creatures, the _amoeba_, or  proteus, which we may find during the summer in almost every fresh water  pond. I cannot describe it, for, like its namesake, it is constantly  changing its form, slipping away from us, as it were, right before our  eyes, and assuming a new shape. As Proteus of old could assume any form,  either plant or animal as he pleased, so our _amoeba_ can assume  various forms at pleasure.    You will remember that Homer introduces Proteus in the fourth book of  the _Odyssey_. He makes him the servant of Neptune, and says his office  was to take care of the seals or sea-calves. And who knows but his  namesake may have some such office among the curious beings of the  microscopic world which is peopled with as many strange creatures as  those we read of in ancient mythology?    We frequently see our proteus adhering to a leaf of some water plant  when it looks like a little ball of jelly; and while we are looking at  it, it pushes out an arm here, and now another there, and still another,  as if feeling for something. (_Fig. 1, Amoeba princeps._) Not finding  anything to its taste, it moves or crawls along with its temporary arms  extended--all the while changing them, throwing one out on this side,  then on that, then contracting and pushing out in another place. It  seems to be actively in search of something. At last it has reached a  moving diatom with one of its long arms, which it immediately wraps  around it, and now the other arms are contracted and the creature  actually folds itself around its dinner! He turns himself outside in,  and makes a temporary stomach, and proceeds to digest the soft parts of  the diatom. After he has extracted all the nourishing part, he squeezes  or pushes out the clear, transparent shell, and starts in search for  something more.    It is not known to a certainty how the _amoebae_ are produced, but this  much is known: If a portion of the body is detached from the rest, it  does not die, but becomes an independent _amoeba_. If a portion of one  of the arms becomes separated from the main body, it does not seem to  incommode the creature in the least, and the small part soon begins to  extend tiny arms and behave in every way like its parent. And this may  be the only way in which the children of Proteus are made--veritable  children of his own flesh.    How strange it seems that a jelly-like mass of substance without form or  organization should be endowed with life and sufficient sense to go in  search of food and have the power of selection.    Life manifested in the lowest animal or plant is just as wonderful and  hard to understand as that which pervades the higher animals.    Some of the species of the fresh water _amoeba_ live in shells of  various forms and patterns. One which we often see has a little house  made of tiny particles of sand and minute bits of shell soldered  together with a kind of cement which hardens in water; these are vase or  pitcher-shaped and always look rough on the outside.      [Illustration: FIG. 2. TESTACEOUS FORMS OF AMOEBAN RHIZOPODS.]    We may always know the different species by the forms and patterns of  the shells in which they live. Some have very regular shells and  prettily marked. These are usually rounded or arched on one side and  flat on the other.    When you are looking for various microscopic objects in pond water you  will often see these tiny shells among the sediment on your slides, and  if you will patiently wait a few moments you will soon see delicate,  transparent arms slowly pushing out on every side like cautious feelers.  (_Figure 2, Amoeba in Shell._--_Carpenter_, p. 445.)    But the most beautiful forms, and by far the greatest variety of these  microscopic shells are found in the ocean and in marine deposits. If we  look at the seaweeds which grow on the rocks we may see many white  specks adhering to every part of the plants. With a lens we find the  minute specks are spiral shells of many species belonging to the class  _Foraminifera_, and very closely allied to the _amoeba_. The shells  are of most elegant form and pattern. The large sea-shells which we so  much admire are not half so lovely in form or color as these seen  through a microscope. Some of the living animals and the castles in  which they dwell are crimson in color, others a delicate pink.    Let us take one of these living shells while it clings to the sea-weed  and carefully cut off the smallest portion of the plant to which it  adheres, so as to disturb the occupant as little as possible; and now  place it in the live box with some of the salt water and we shall soon  have a most beautiful sight.    See, the creature is throwing out delicate, transparent threads or  filaments in every direction, like fine-spun glass. How charming it  looks with the beautiful shell in the centre, surrounded by this moving,  filmy halo, and how slowly and cautiously the filaments are extended! He  is not a heedless, reckless creature, rushing into needless danger, but  a quiet, timid citizen. Although he was such a long time throwing out  his misty arms, when he scents danger he withdraws them as quick as a  flash. The least jar of the live-box, or a little wriggling larva--much  too large for him to manage, however--are sufficient to make him take in  all of his lines; but when quiet is restored, they are again stretched  out. And for what purpose are these slender filaments extended? Ah, an  innocent animalcule has become entangled among the shimmering, filmy  threads, and now the threads coalesce, run together like the arms of  _amoeba_, and disappear, and the animalcule is drawn within the walls  of the beautiful castle, and we are left to conjecture the fate of the  little victim. _Figure 3, Rotalia Ornata_--which shows its delicate  filaments extended.    These tiny creatures have been so numerous way back in the early ages of  the world, that entire strata of rocks, several feet in thickness, in  various parts of the world, are made up of their skeletons. The city of  Richmond, Virginia, is built over rocks, composed largely of the minute  fossils of _Diatomaceae_ intermingled with the _Foraminifera_ and others.      [Illustration: FIG. 3. ROTALIA ORNATA.]    A single prepared slide of these fossils will afford entertainment for  an entire evening, so great is the diversity of form and so many  hundreds on one slide. The Bahama Islands furnish the finest specimens  of these fossils. The slides can be procured of any large dealer in  optical instruments, or, what is still better, the young microscopist  can soon learn to prepare them for himself, as ample directions are  given in the books on the microscope.    In bidding my young readers adieu I shall not lose entire thought of  them, but often when I am engaged in looking through the microscope, I  shall think and ask myself, \"Are they, too, absorbed in this pleasant  work, and how many will become true workers and original investigators  in this great field?\" We shall all know in due time, for no earnest  worker in any branch of science can long remain unknown. He will be  found out sooner or later. A devoted student in microscopy will become  so happy over the marvellous creatures and their curious ways that he  cannot keep his pleasure to himself.          PART III    A HOME-MADE MICROSCOPE, AND HOW TO USE IT    BY FREDERICK LEROY SARGENT      XIII.--HOW TO SEE A DANDELION.    A simple microscope, some mounted needles, a sharp knife and a pair of  small forceps, are the only things needed to begin with.    There are many kinds of simple microscopes sold, some of which are of  moderate price and answer every purpose; but if one has a little  mechanical skill the cheapest way is to buy a magnifier and make the  rest of the microscope one's self. What is known as the \"bellows  pattern,\" with three lenses, is one of the best of the cheaper forms of  magnifiers, and is an admirable little instrument.    _Fig. 1_ shows a home-made microscope ready for use. It will be seen  that the main part consists of a wooden box having a hole in the top and  open in front. To the back is attached a cork by means of a piece of  thin metal as shown in _fig. 2_. Through this cord slides a rod on which  slides another cork. A piece of brass wire has one end wound round the  upper cork while the other end projects as an arm at right angles to the  rod, and this projecting end sharpened and upturned, passes through  holes drilled in the handle of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38440"],[0,"A Distributional Study of the Amphibians of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, México (#8)"],[1,"probably were not eliminated, for the great  diversity of animals in these environments supports the hypothesis that  they have been in existence for some time, although periodically they  may have been discontinuous.    In order to understand the nature of bioclimatological events in the  Pleistocene in lowland tropical environments of southern Mexico,  certain factors that are of little importance in the interpretation of  Pleistocene chronology in the highlands must be considered. These  factors are: 1) climatic moderation by oceans, 2) fluctuation in sea  level, and 3) fluctuation in level of the water table as affected by  sea level.    It is well-known that large bodies of water moderate the temperature on  adjacent land. Furthermore, it is known that faunas of marine  invertebrates shifted latitudinally in the Pleistocene; Trask, Phleger,  and Stetson (1947) recorded cold-water Foraminifera then as far south  as the Sigsbee Deep in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. Large bodies  of warm water, such as the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Pacific  Ocean of today, probably were not sufficiently cooled at the time of  glacial advance to affect greatly the temperature of the winds blowing  across them. Even if these bodies of water were somewhat cooler than  now, the prevailing winds blowing from them onto the lowlands of Mexico  and northern Central America would have aided in maintaining relatively  high temperatures there. These warm winds probably counteracted the  cooling effect of glaciation in the lowlands and thereby maintained  tropical conditions near the seas.    Although no adequate studies of Pleistocene beach lines have been made  in southern Mexico, such information is available for peninsular  Florida on the other side of the Gulf of Mexico (Cooke, 1945).  Fluctuation in sea level in the Pleistocene has been used by Hubbell  (1954), Goin (1958), and Duellman and Schwartz (1958) to explain  present patterns of distribution of animals in Florida. If Cooke's  interpretations can be applied to the western side of the Gulf of  Mexico, even generally, it would be supposed that sea level varied from  about 300 feet lower than at present during the Illinoian Glacial  Period to about 275 feet higher than at present during the Aftonian  Interglacial Period. Lowering of sea level would expand the lowlands in  the isthmus; rising sea level would restrict them, leaving only the  central ridges and many islands in the isthmus, but never forming a  seaway between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.    Probably the level of the water table in the coastal lowlands and the  gradients of the streams in the lowlands and foothills was closely  correlated with fluctuation in sea level. If sea level fluctuated as  much as 575 feet in the Pleistocene, changes in the level of the water  table must have been of considerable magnitude.    During times of glacial advances the lowlands of the isthmus probably  were more extensive and had more semi-arid tropical environments than  at present, with patches of rainforest existing in sheltered valleys  along the major streams. In the course of bio-climatic fluctuation the  semi-arid environments (scrub forest and/or savanna) were continuous at  times from the Pacific lowlands across the isthmus to the Gulf  lowlands. At those times such typical inhabitants of the semi-arid  environments as _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_, _Engystomops pustulosus_, and  _Hyla staufferi_ could have made their way across the isthmus. At times  of most extensive glaciation, such as the Illinoian, temperatures in  the isthmus probably were low enough to permit the growth of pine-oak  forest and cloud forest continuously across the central ridges from the  Mexican to the Chiapan-Guatemalan highlands. At those times such  highland members of the fauna as _Chiropterotriton_, _Pseudoeurycea_,  _Magnadigita_, and the _eximia_ group of _Hyla_ could have crossed the  isthmus. During Wisconsin time, climate probably fluctuated less than  during previous glaciations; probably no montane environments, except  cloud forest, were represented in the isthmus during the Wisconsin.  Even at this relatively late date such animals as _Lineatriton  lineola_, _Anotheca coronata_, and _Phyllomedusa moreleti_ could have  crossed the isthmus.    During the interglacial periods, which in the isthmian region were  characterized by warmer temperatures, higher sea level and consequently  more restricted areas of lowlands, and possibly more rainfall than in  the glacial periods, the continuity of pine-oak forest and cloud forest  from east to west across the isthmus was interrupted. Probably, too,  the semi-arid environments were restricted, and the rainforests were  more widespread. At those times animals now inhabiting the rainforests  of the Gulf lowlands and those inhabiting the Pacific lowlands of  Chiapas and Guatemala could have crossed the isthmus. In this group are  species such as _Bolitoglossa occidentalis_, _Eleutherodactylus  rhodopis_, _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_, and _Rana palmipes_.    The amount of differentiation in isolated populations of amphibians in  southern Mexico and northern Central America gives some idea of  relative lengths of time of isolation from related populations. Those  populations inhabiting high mountain environments on either side of the  isthmus are specifically distinct. Some populations inhabiting cloud  forests lower on the mountains are specifically distinct from related  populations on the other side of the isthmus; between others there is  no recognizable differentiation. Even though many populations are  isolated from other populations of the same species in the lowlands of  the isthmus, there is no apparent speciation. This indicates that the  lowland environments and their inhabitants have been isolated from one  another for a shorter time than have the highland environments and  their inhabitants.          ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES      For each species of amphibian known to occur in the lowlands of the  Isthmus of Tehuantepec, localities where one or more specimens were  collected are listed, and variation, ecology, and life histories are  discussed. A total of 2833 specimens has been examined for the purposes  of this study. Individual specimens cited in the text are listed with  catalogue numbers and abbreviations of the name of the museum, as  follows:         AMNH  American Museum of Natural History       KU    University of Kansas Museum of Natural History       MCZ   Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard College       UIMNH University of Illinois Museum of Natural History       UMMZ  University of Michigan Museum of Zoology       USNM  United States National Museum      =Gymnopis mexicanus mexicanus= Dumeril and Bibron         _Oaxaca_: El Barrio (3); Matias Romero; Tehuantepec (2).       _Veracruz_: Cosamaloapan; Cuatotolapam (2).    The two specimens from Cuatotolapam were collected by Ruthven in an  area of mixed savanna and forest. The three specimens (USNM 30535-7)  listed above from El Barrio were collected by Sumichrast; possibly they  came from another locality. The city of Tehuantepec is divided into  seven districts called \"barrios.\" The two specimens listed from  Tehuantepec (MCZ 1604) merely bear the data \"Tehuantepec, Mexico.\" They  may have come from the town, the district, or from anywhere in the  isthmus. The specimen from Matias Romero has 109 primary and 67  secondary annuli, a length of 400 mm., and a diameter of 19 mm.; the  one from Cosamaloapan has 106 primary and 58 secondary annuli, a length  of 397 mm., and a diameter of 19 mm. Data on the other specimens were  recorded by Dunn (1942:475).      =Bolitoglossa occidentalis= Taylor         _Oaxaca_: Rio Sarabia (2); Ubero. _Veracruz_: La Oaxaquena;       14 km. E of Suchil.    The specimens from Oaxaca are only tentatively assigned to  _occidentalis_. All are immature and lack maxillary teeth. Taylor  (1941:147) stated that the maxillary teeth are absent in young  _occidentalis_. One from Rio Sarabia is a male with a body-length of 29  mm. and a tail-length of 22 mm. The dorsum is reddish brown streaked  with dark gray; the venter is dark gray. Two small individuals (one  from Sarabia and one from Ubero) have body-lengths of 19 and 21 mm. and  tail-lengths of 10.5 and 11 mm. In life they were pale yellowish tan  above with a brown triangular mark on the occiput, but with no  middorsal stripe. Both were found in the axils of elephant ear plants  (_Xanthosoma_).    This species has been noted by Goodnight and Goodnight (1956:146) on  the Atlantic lowlands at Palenque, Chiapas, and by Shannon and Werler  (1955:362) at several localities in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz. I have  collected it at Vista Hermosa on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre  Oriental above Tuxtepec in northern Oaxaca. Both _B. occidentalis_ and  _B. rufescens_ have been reported from Palenque, Chiapas (Taylor and  Smith, 1945:547). Reexamination of specimens from northern Chiapas and  Tabasco is needed to verify the sympatric occurrence of these two  similar species.      =Bolitoglossa platydactyla= Tschudi         _Oaxaca_: La Oaxaquena; Tolosita (2). _Veracruz_: Acayucan;       Cuatotolapam; 25 km. ESE of Jesus Carranza; 14 km. E of       Suchil; 2.7 km. N of Tula.    Known only from the Gulf lowlands in the isthmian region, this species  has been taken in a variety of habitats within the humid forest area:  under outer leaves of banana plants, under a rock along a stream, under  a log in a plowed field, and on a reed in a pond at night. Three adult  males have an average snout-vent length of 44 mm. and a tail-length of  41 mm. In life the color of the dorsum varied from orange-yellow to  orange-tan, usually being more orange on the tail. The iris was a  reddish orange.      =Bolitoglossa veracrucis= Taylor         _Veracruz_: 35 km. SE of Jesus Carranza (21).    This species is known only from the type series collected at"]]]
