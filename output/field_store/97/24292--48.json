Then a bunch of these fellers in the city  started to drive her down and they got her pushed down to twenty-four,  and I held on to her and they shoved her down to twenty-one. This  morning they've got her down to sixteen, but I don't mean to let go. No,  sir.\"    In another fortnight they shoved her, the same unscrupulous crowd, down  to nine cents, and Jefferson still held on. \"They're working her down,\"  he admitted, \"but I'm holding her.\"    No conflict between vice and virtue was ever grimmer.    \"She's at six,\" said Jeff, \"but I've got her. They can't squeeze me.\"    A few days after that, the same criminal gang had her down further than  ever.    \"They've got her down to three cents,\" said Jeff, \"but I'm with her.  Yes, sir, they think they can shove her clean off the market, but  they can't do it. I've boughten in Johnson's shares, and the whole of  Netley's, and I'll stay with her till she breaks.\"    So they shoved and pushed and clawed her down--that unseen nefarious  crowd in the city--and Jeff held on to her and they writhed and twisted  at his grip, and then--    And then--well, that's just the queer thing about the mining business.  Why, sudden as a flash of lightning, it seemed, the news came over the  wire to the Mariposa Newspacket, that they had struck a vein of silver  in the Northern Star as thick as a sidewalk, and that the stock had  jumped to seventeen dollars a share, and even at that you couldn't get  it! And Jeff stood there flushed and half-staggered against the mirror  of the little shop, with a bunch of mining scrip in his hand that was  worth forty thousand dollars!    Excitement! It was all over the town in a minutes. They ran off a news  extra at the Mariposa Newspacket, and in less than no time there wasn't  standing room in the barber shop, and over in Smith's Hotel they had  three extra barkeepers working on the lager beer pumps.    They were selling mining shares on the Main Street in Mariposa that  afternoon and people were just clutching for them. Then at night there  was a big oyster supper in Smith's caff, with speeches, and the Mariposa  band outside.    And the queer thing was that the very next afternoon was the funeral  of young Fizzlechip, and Dean Drone had to change the whole text of  his Sunday sermon at two days' notice for fear of offending public  sentiment.    But I think what Jeff liked best of it all was the sort of public  recognition that it meant. He'd stand there in the shop, hardly  bothering to shave, and explain to the men in the arm-chairs how he held  her, and they shoved her, and he clung to her, and what he'd said to  himself--a perfect Iliad--while he was clinging to her.    The whole thing was in the city papers a few days after with a  photograph of Jeff, taken specially at Ed Moore's studio (upstairs over  Netley's). It showed Jeff sitting among palm trees, as all mining men  do, with one hand on his knee, and a dog, one of those regular mining  dogs, at his feet, and a look of piercing intelligence in his face that  would easily account for forty thousand dollars.    I say that the recognition meant a lot to Jeff for its own sake. But no  doubt the fortune meant quite a bit to him too on account of Myra.    Did I mention Myra, Jeff's daughter? Perhaps not. That's the  trouble with the people in Mariposa; they're all so separate and so  different--not a bit like the people in the cities--that unless you hear  about them separately and one by one you can't for a moment understand  what they're like.    Myra had golden hair and a Greek face and would come bursting through  the barber shop in a hat at least six inches wider than what they  wear in Paris. As you saw her swinging up the street to the Telephone  Exchange in a suit that was straight out of the Delineator and brown  American boots, there was style written all over her,--the kind of  thing that Mariposa recognised and did homage to. And to see her in the  Exchange,--she was one of the four girls that I spoke of,--on her high  stool with a steel cap on,--jabbing the connecting plugs in and out  as if electricity cost nothing--well, all I mean is that you could  understand why it was that the commercial travellers would stand round  in the Exchange calling up all sorts of impossible villages, and  waiting about so pleasant and genial!--it made one realize how naturally  good-tempered men are. And then when Myra would go off duty and Miss  Cleghorn, who was sallow, would come on, the commercial men would be off  again like autumn leaves.    It just shows the difference between people. There was Myra who treated  lovers like dogs and would slap them across the face with a banana skin  to show her utter independence. And there was Miss Cleghorn, who was  sallow, and who bought a forty cent Ancient History to improve herself:  and yet if she'd hit any man in Mariposa with a banana skin, he'd have  had her arrested for assault.    Mind you, I don't mean that Myra was merely flippant and worthless. Not  at all. She was a girl with any amount of talent. You should have heard  her recite \"The Raven,\" at the Methodist Social! Simply genius! And when  she acted Portia in the Trial Scene of the Merchant of Venice at the  High School concert, everybody in Mariposa admitted that you couldn't  have told it from the original.    So, of course, as soon as Jeff made the fortune, Myra had her  resignation in next morning and everybody knew that she was to go to  a dramatic school for three months in the fall and become a leading  actress.    But, as I said, the public recognition counted a lot for Jeff. The  moment you begin to get that sort of thing it comes in quickly enough.  Brains, you know, are recognized right away. That was why, of course,  within a week from this Jeff received the first big packet of stuff from  the Cuban Land Development Company, with coloured pictures of Cuba,  and fields of bananas, and haciendas and insurrectos with machetes and  Heaven knows what. They heard of him, somehow,--it wasn't for a modest  man like Jefferson to say how. After all, the capitalists of the world  are just one and the same crowd. If you're in it, you're in it, that's  all! Jeff realized why it is that of course men like Carnegie or  Rockefeller and Morgan all know one another. They have to.    For all I know, this Cuban stuff may have been sent from Morgan himself.  Some of the people in Mariposa said yes, others said no. There was no  certainty.    Anyway, they were fair and straight, this Cuban crowd that wrote to  Jeff. They offered him to come right in and be one of themselves. If a  man's got the brains, you may as well recognize it straight away. Just  as well write him to be a director now as wait and hesitate till he  forces his way into it.    Anyhow, they didn't hesitate, these Cuban people that wrote to Jeff from  Cuba--or from a post-office box in New York--it's all the same thing,  because Cuba being so near to New York the mail is all distributed from  there. I suppose in some financial circles they might have been slower,  wanted guarantees of some sort, and so on, but these Cubans, you  know, have got a sort of Spanish warmth of heart that you don't see  in business men in America, and that touches you. No, they asked no  guarantee. Just send the money whether by express order or by bank draft  or cheque, they left that entirely to oneself, as a matter between Cuban  gentlemen.    And they were quite frank about their enterprise--bananas and tobacco  in the plantation district reclaimed from the insurrectos. You  could see it all there in the pictures--tobacco plants and the  insurrectos--everything. They made no rash promises, just admitted  straight out that the enterprise might realise 400 per cent. or might  conceivably make less. There was no hint of more.    So within a month, everybody in Mariposa knew that Jeff Thorpe was \"in  Cuban lands\" and would probably clean up half a million by New Year's.  You couldn't have failed to know it. All round the little shop there  were pictures of banana groves and the harbour of Habana, and Cubans in  white suits and scarlet sashes, smoking cigarettes in the sun and too  ignorant to know that you can make four hundred per cent. by planting a  banana tree.    I liked it about Jeff that he didn't stop shaving. He went on just  the same. Even when Johnson, the livery stable man, came in with five  hundred dollars and asked him to see if the Cuban Board of Directors  would let him put it in, Jeff laid it in the drawer and then shaved him  for five cents, in the same old way. Of course, he must have felt proud  when, a few days later, he got a letter from the Cuban people, from New  York, accepting the money straight off without a single question, and  without knowing anything more of Johnson except that he was a friend of  Jeff's. They wrote most handsomely. Any friends of Jeff's were friends  of Cuba. All money they might send would be treated just as Jeff's would  be treated.    One reason, perhaps, why Jeff didn't give up shaving was because it  allowed him to talk about Cuba. You see, everybody knew in Mariposa that  Jeff Thorpe had sold out of Cobalts and had gone into Cuban Renovated  Lands--and that spread round him a kind of halo of wealth and mystery  and outlandishness--oh, something Spanish. Perhaps you've felt it about  people that you know. Anyhow, they asked him about the climate, and  yellow fever and what the negroes were like and all that sort of thing.    \"This Cubey, it appears is an island,\" Jeff would explain. Of  course, everybody knows how easily islands lend themselves to making  money,--\"and for fruit, they say it comes up so fast you can't stop  it.\" And then he would pass into details about the Hash-enders and the  resurrectos and technical things like that till it was thought a wonder  how he could know it. Still, it was realized that a man with money has  got to know these things. Look at Morgan and Rockefeller"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35333"],[0,"Life of Heber C. Kimball, an Apostle (#8)"],[1,"Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, and it  was to be erected by a stated time. The Church was in a state of  poverty and distress, in consequence of which it appeared almost  impossible that the commandment could be fulfilled. Soon after our  arrival, there was a contribution called for to finish the  school-house and printing office; I contributed the glass for the  house, and I gave Brother Hyrum Smith two hundred dollars for the  building of the temple.\"    The newly arrived pilgrims had fallen on perilous times. Mobocracy was  rife and rampant; persecution was raging against the Church, both in  Ohio and in Missouri. The infernal regions seemed stirred to their  depths at the prospect of a temple, whose walls, now climbing  heavenward, gave promise of salvation and deliverance for the living  and the dead; the unlocking of prison doors, the bursting of spirit  dungeons, the smiting off of fetters from the limbs of the slave of  sin, and the ushering forth of the penitent captive into the life and  light of gospel liberty. Keys were about to be restored whereby the  heavens would be brought nearer to the earth, the prophets of the past  would minister in holy places to the prophets of the present, and the  cause of human redemption receive such an impetus as would shake the  throne of Satan to its foundations. No wonder the dominions of Sheol  were agitated.    \"Our enemies,\" says Heber, \"were raging and threatening destruction  upon us. We had to guard night after night, and for weeks were not  permitted to take off our clothes, and were obliged to lie with our  fire-locks in our arms, to preserve Brother Joseph's life and our own.  Joseph was sued before a magistrate's court in Painesville, on a  vexatious suit. I carried him from Kirtland to Painesville, with four  or five others, in my wagon, every morning for five days, and brought  them back in the evening. We were often waylaid, but managed to elude  our enemies by rapid driving and taking different roads. Esquire  Bissell defended the Prophet and he came off victorious.    \"At this time our brethren in Jackson County, Missouri, were also  suffering great persecution; about twelve hundred were driven,  plundered and robbed, their houses burned, and some of the brethren  were killed.    \"Mobs were organized around Kirtland, who were enraged against us,  ready to destroy us.\"    Such was the state of affairs with the Church of the living God, at  the close of the year 1833. Such was the nature of the action upon  which the hero of this history had entered. But he was of the gold,  not the dross of the earth, and passed through the fire, purified, yet  not consumed.          CHAPTER VI.    THE GATHERING OF THE TITANS--HEBER'S TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH AND THE  TWELVE--THEIR MIGHTY MISSION--THE TEST OF FAITH--ZION'S CAMP.      Joseph, Brigham and Heber together in Kirtland! By what strange  fatality were these mighty lives thus interwoven? We have seen how  Brigham and Heber came together, and how, from thenceforth, the  currents of their lives and fortunes ran parallel. Now they were  joined with Joseph, their prophet chief, like streams that swell a  river.    Interesting is it also, if only as a coincidence, that so many of the  leading spirits of the latter-day work should have been natives of  Vermont--a diadem for thee, proud State, and one which thou wilt prize  in coming time!--from whence scattered, ere acquaintance with the  Gospel or with each other began, to meet as co-laborers in the same  great cause, among the hills and dales of Northern Ohio. As though the  heavens had decreed their lives should thus commingle.    And the heavens had so decreed. It was not chance, it was destiny  \"shaping their ends,\" and fulfilling her mission in their behalf. And  though from the ends of the earth--what matter names or nativity?--it  had been the same. \"He that scattered Israel will gather him.\" From  all nations that fated blood, when goes Jehovah's fiat forth, like the  rain-drops sprinkled upon the hills, must trickle back to the Ocean  whence it came.    It was a coalescing of divine affinities, the relinking of a spirit  chain, which, though it often part, is never broken, and though  seemingly divided, forever inseparable.    \"Are you ever going to be prepared to see God, Jesus Christ, His  angels, or comprehend His servants, unless you take a faithful and  prayerful course?\"    \"Did you actually know Joseph Smith?\"    The questions are Heber C. Kimball's, addressed in later years to a  congregation of the Saints.    \"No,\" he answers for them, and continues:    \"Do you know Brother Brigham? No.\"    \"Do you know Brother Heber? No; you do not.\"    \"Do you know the Twelve? You do not; if you did you would begin to  know God, and learn that those men who are chosen to direct and  counsel you, are near kindred to God and to Jesus Christ, for the  keys, power and authority of the kingdom of God are in that lineage.\"    This, then, was the purpose, the divine intending, for which they were  now in conjunction; \"noble and great ones,\" great in the heavens and  great upon the earth, ordained as \"rulers\" ere morning stars sang  gladsome greeting, or Sons of God shouted for joy around the cradle of  the infant world. This, the object of their descent from celestial  empires; to build up a Kingdom unto God, and prepare the world for the  coming of Him \"whose right it is to reign.\" Jewels from Jehovah's  diadem, diamonds in the dust, unseen of saint or sinner in all their  lustre, concealed from a world unworthy of the light it could not  comprehend.    Had Heber's inspired mind probed the secret of Joseph's thought,  expressed in his own oft-quoted words: \"Would to God, brethren, I  could tell you who I am!\"    As Prophet, Seer, and Revelator to the Church of Jesus Christ, its  president and earthly head, and holder of the keys of the last  dispensation, Joseph was already in the high and holy office for which  he was predestined and fore-ordained. Not so, Brigham; not so, Heber;  not so their apostolic compeers. A trial of their faith was first  necessary, a trial now near at hand, to prove them worthy in the flesh  of the great calling whereunto they were called in the eternal  councils.    In the month of February, 1834, came a commandment from the Almighty  unto His prophet, to \"gather up the strength of His house,\" and \"go up  and redeem Zion;\" in other words, to recover from the hands of a  fierce and merciless mob the lands in Jackson County, Missouri, from  which the Saints had been driven.    Such were the origin and object of Zion's Camp. Such, the nature of  the perilous duty laid upon them.          CHAPTER VII.    THE REDEMPTION OF ZION--ENOCH'S CITY TO RETURN--OBJECT OF THE UNITED  ORDER--CAUSE OF THE JACKSON COUNTY EXPULSION--THE WHEAT FROM THE  CHAFF.      The redemption of Zion! The building of the new Jerusalem!    Theme of the ancient prophets and glory of the latter days!    Such was the sublime mission given to the Saints of the Most High.  Thus came the word of the Lord concerning it, March, 1831:        \"Wherefore, I, the Lord, have said, gather ye out from the eastern      lands, assemble ye yourselves together ye elders of my Church; go      ye forth into the western countries; * *        \"And with one heart and with one mind, gather up your riches that      ye may purchase an inheritance which shall hereafter be appointed      unto you,        \"And it shall be called the New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city      of refuge, a place of safety for the Saints of the Most High God;        \"And the glory of the Lord shall be there, and the terror of the      Lord also shall be there, insomuch that the wicked will not come      unto it, and it shall be called Zion.        \"And it shall come to pass, among the wicked, that every man that      will not take his sword against his neighbor, must needs flee unto      Zion for safety.        \"And there shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under      heaven; and it shall be the only people that shall not be at war      one with another.        \"And it shall be said among the wicked, let us not go up to battle      against Zion, for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible; wherefore      we cannot stand.        \"And it shall come to pass that the righteous shall be gathered      out from among all nations, and shall come to Zion, singing with      songs of everlasting joy.\"    With this glorious object in view, this sublime motive firing their  souls and filling their hearts with holy zeal, the Saints, in the  summer of 1831, had commenced gathering upon the land of Zion--Jackson  County, Missouri, the chosen site of the great city and temple of God.  Their purpose, to fulfil prophecy, to found the modern Zion, New  Jerusalem, capital city of the kingdom of God. A counterpart of the  Zion of Enoch, sanctified of old and taken into the heavens, to return  in latter times as a leaven of righteousness, to leaven this lump of  clay, the mother earth of our mortality, and make it like unto itself,  and in due time a glorified planet, purified, redeemed, and from sin  forever free.    To prepare the world for that supreme hour \"when the Lord shall bring  again Zion,\" was and is the mission of the Saints of latter days. And  this that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says:        \"The Lord hath brought down Zion from above.        \"The Lord hath brought up Zion from beneath.        \"The earth hath travailed and brought forth her strength:        \"And truth is established in her bowels:        \"And the heavens have smiled upon her:        \"And she is clothed with the glory of her God:        \"For he stands in the midst of his people.\"    The meeting of the Zions! The marriage of the worlds! Zion from  beneath, the type of truth from earth, embracing Zion from above, the  symbol of righteousness from heaven.    \"And they twain shall be one!\"    Preparatory to this miraculous event, and indeed to"]]]
