They may be  slightly expanded at any other part by closing one end and gently  blowing into the open end of the tube, after softening the glass at the  part to be widened before the blow-pipe. But the best method of  obtaining a wide tube with narrow extremities (Fig. 11) is to join  pieces of narrow tube _AA_ to the ends of a piece of wider tube _B_ of  the desired dimensions. The method of performing this operation is  described under welding, on pp. 39-47.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    [Illustration: FIG. 12.]      =Piercing Tubes.=--The glass-blower very frequently requires to make a  large or small opening in some part of a tube or other piece of  apparatus. This is known as piercing. Suppose it is desired to make a  small hole at the point _a_ in _A_ (Fig. 12). When the tube has been  brought to the flame with the usual precautions, allow the end of the  pointed flame to touch it at _a_ till an area corresponding to the  desired size of the opening is thoroughly softened. Then expand the  softened glass by blowing to the form shown at _B_. Re-heat _a_, blow a  small globe as at _C_, and carefully break the thin glass, then smooth  the rough edges by rotating them in the flame till they form a mouth  like that of _D_. Instead of leaving the bulb to be broken at the third  stage _C_, it is a good plan to blow more strongly, so that the bulb  becomes very thin and bursts, the removal of the thin glass is then  accompanied by less risk of producing a crack in the thicker parts of  the glass. Openings may be made in a similar manner in the sides of  tubes or in globes, in fact, in almost any position on glass apparatus.  If another tube is to be attached at the opening, it is a good plan to  proceed to this operation before the tube has cooled down.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    The openings obtained by the method above described are too large when  platinum wires are to be sealed into them. Suppose that it is necessary  to pierce the tube _A_ of Fig. 13 in order to insert a platinum wire at  _a_; direct the smallest pointed flame that will heat a spot of glass to  redness on the point _a_. When the glass is viscous, touch it with the  end of a platinum wire _w_, to which the glass will adhere; withdraw the  wire and the viscous glass will be drawn out into a small tube, as shown  at _B_; by breaking the end of this tube a small opening will be made.  Introduce a platinum wire into the opening, and again allow the flame to  play on the glass at that point; it will melt and close round the wire.  Before the hot glass has time to cool, blow gently into the mouth of the  tube to produce a slightly curved surface, then heat the neighbouring  parts of the tube till the glass is about to soften, and let it cool in  cotton wool. Unless this is done, I find that glass tubes into which  platinum wires have been sealed are very apt to break during or after  cooling.    To ensure that the tube shall be perfectly air-tight, a small piece of  white enamel should be attached to the glass at _a_ before sealing in  the wire.      =Uniting Pieces of Glass to Each Other, known as Welding, or  Soldering.=--The larger and more complicated pieces of glass apparatus  are usually made in separate sections, and completed by joining together  the several parts. This is therefore a very important operation, and  should be thoroughly mastered before proceeding to further work.    In order to produce secure joints, the use of tubes made of different  kinds of glass must be avoided. Soda glass may be joined securely to  soda glass, especially if the tubes belong to the same batch, and lead  glass to lead glass. But, though by special care a joint between lead  glass and soda glass, if well made, will often hold together, yet it is  never certain that it will do so.    _To join two Tubes of Equal Diameters._--Close one end of one of the  tubes with a small cork. Heat the open end of the closed tube, and  either end of the other tube in a small flame until they are almost  melted, taking care that only the ends of the tubes are heated, and not  to let the glass be thickened; bring the two ends together with  sufficient pressure to make them adhere, but not sufficient to compress  the glass to a thickened ring. Before the joint has time to cool too  much, adjust your blow-pipe for a pointed flame, if you are not already  working with that kind of flame, and allow the point of the flame to  play on any spot on the joint till it is heated to redness; rotate the  tube a little so as to heat the glass adjacent to that which is already  red-hot, and repeat this till the whole circumference of the rough joint  has been heated.[7] Repeat the operation last described, but, when each  spot is red-hot, blow gently into the open end of the tube so as to  slightly expand the viscous glass. Finally, rotate the whole joint in  the flame till the glass is softened, and blow gently as before into the  open end of the tube, still rotating it, in order that the joint may be  as symmetrical as possible. If in the last operation the diameter of the  joint becomes greater than that of the rest of the tube, it may be  cautiously re-heated and reduced by pulling it out, or this may be  secured by gently pulling apart the two ends, whilst the operator blows  it into its final shape.    [7] Some glass-blowers at once work on the glass as next described,  without this preliminary treatment. I find that some glass, usually soda  glass, will not always bear the necessary movements without breaking  unless first heated all round.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    When small tubes, or tubes of fine bore, are to be joined, in order to  prevent the fused glass from running together and closing the tube, it  is a good plan to border and enlarge the ends that are to be united, as  at _A_ (Fig. 14). Some glass-blowers prefer to border all tubes before  uniting them.    When a narrow tube is to be joined to one that is only slightly wider,  expand the end of the narrow tube till it corresponds in size to the  larger tube. If the tube be too narrow to be enlarged by inserting a  charcoal cone, seal one end and pierce it as directed (on p. 37).    For joining small thin-walled tubes Mr. Crookes recommends the use of a  small Bunsen flame.    In welding pieces of lead glass tube, take care that the heated glass is  perfectly free from reduced lead at the moment when the two ends of  viscous glass are brought into contact.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.]    _To join Tubes of Unequal Sizes End to End_ (Fig. 15).--Draw out the  larger tube and cut off the drawn-out end at the part where its diameter  is equal to that of the smaller tube, then seal the smaller tube to the  contracted end of the larger according to the directions given for  joining tubes of equal size. When a good joint has been made, the tube  presents the appearance of _A_, Fig. 15, the union being at about _bb_.  Next heat the whole tube between the dotted lines _aa_, and blow it into  the shape of _B_ in which the dotted line _dd_ should correspond to the  actual line of junction of the two tubes.    In making all joints it is important to leave no thick masses of glass  about them. If the glass be fairly thin and uniformly distributed, it is  less likely to break during or after annealing under any circumstances,  and especially if it has to bear alternations of temperature.    _Joining a Tube to the Side of another Tube_ (Fig. 16).--One of the  tubes must be pierced as at _A_ in Fig. 16 (for the method, see p. 37),  and its two ends closed with small pieces of cork. The edges of the  opening, and one end of the other tube, must then be heated till they  melt, and united by pressing them together. The joint may then be  finished as before.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.]    A properly blown joint will not present the appearance of _B_ (Fig. 16),  but rather that of _C_. This is secured by directing the pointed flame  upon the glass at _aa_ (_B_) spot by spot, and blowing out each spot  when it is sufficiently softened. If the tubes are large, the whole  joint should subsequently be heated and blown, but in the case of small  tubes this is of less importance. Finally it is to be wrapped whilst hot  in cotton wool for the annealing process.    If a second tube has to be joined near to the first one, say at _b_, it  is well to proceed with it before the joint first made cools down, and  the joint first made, especially if soda glass be used, must be held in  the flame from time to time during the process of making the second  joint to keep it hot; if this be not done the first joint is very likely  to break. A joint previously made may, however, be re-heated, if well  made and well annealed.    A three-way tube, like that in Fig. 17, is made by bending _A_ (Fig. 16)  to an angle, and joining _B_ to an opening blown on the convex side of  the angle; or, _A_ of Fig. 16 may be bent as desired after attaching _B_  in the ordinary way.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.]    Tubes may also be joined to openings made in the sides of globes or  flasks; great care must be taken, however, especially if the walls of  the globe be thin, to secure that the tube is well attached to the mouth  of the opening when the melted ends are first brought into contact, for,  with thin glass, any hole that may be left will probably increase whilst  the joint is being blown into shape, owing to cohesion causing the glass  to gather in a thickened ring round an enlargement of the original  opening.[8]    [8] If such an opening be observed, it may usually be closed by touching  its edges with a fused point of glass at the end of a drawn out tube.    In order to unite a tube of soda glass to a tube of lead glass, the end  of the soda glass tube must be carefully covered with a layer of soft  arsenic glass.[9] This"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33965"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 4, July, 1851 (#8)"],[1,"so much as you do; and they would consider       our inimitable comedians Levassor and Hoffmann as serious       personages. Do not be angry, then, or cry with  Alceste,--            'Par la sambleu! Messieurs, je ne croyais pas etre           Si plaisant que je suis!'         They would only laugh the more. In this respect the English       are wanting in good taste and indulgence. Their astonishment       is silly and their mockery puerile. The sight of a pair of       moustachios makes them roar with laughter, and they are in       an ecstasy of fun at the sight of a rather broad-brimmed       hat. A people must be very much bored to seize such       occasions for amusing themselves. However, all the       _travers_, like all the qualities of the English, arise from       the national spirit carried to exaggeration. They consider       themselves the _beau ideal_ of human kind. Their stiffness       of bearing, their pale faces, their hair, their whiskers cut       into the shape of mutton chops, the excessive height of       their shirt collars, and the inelegant cut of their       coats--all that makes them as proud as Trafalgar and       Waterloo.         \"In our theatres we laugh at them as they laugh at us, and       on that score we are quits. But in our great towns they are       much better and more seriously received than we Frenchmen       are in England.         \"At Paris now-a-days nobody laughs at an Englishman; but at       London every body laughs at a Frenchman. We do not make this       remark from any feeling of ill-will; in fact, we think that       to cause a smile on the thin and pinched-up lips of old       England is not a small triumph for our beards and       moustachios. After all, too, the astonishment which the       Englishman manifests at the sight of a newly disembarked       Frenchman (an astonishment which appears singular when we       call to mind the frequent communications between the two       nations), is less inexplicable than may be thought.       Geographically speaking, France and England touch each       other--morally, they are at an immeasurable distance.       Nothing is done at Calais as at Dover, nothing at London as       at Paris. There is as much difference between the two races       as between white and black. In France, the Englishman       conforms willingly to our customs, and quickly adopts our       manner of acting; but in England we are like a stain on a       harmonious picture.         \"Our fashion of sauntering along the streets, smiling at the       pretty girls we meet, looking at the shops, or stopping to       chat with a friend, fills the English with stupefaction.       They always walk straight before them like mad dogs. In       conversation there is the same difference. In England it is       always solemn. Left alone after dinner, the men adopt a       subject of conversation, which never varies during all the       rest of the evening. Each one is allowed to develop his       argument without interruption. Perhaps he is not understood,       but he is listened to. When he has ended, it becomes the       turn of another, who is heard with the same respect. The       thing resembles a quiet sitting of the Parliament. But in       France, conversation is a veritable _melee_--it is the       contrary excess. A subject is left and taken up twenty       times, amidst joyous and unforeseen interruptions. We throw       words at each other's heads without doing ourselves any       harm; smart sallies break forth, and _bon mots_ roll under       the table. In short, the Englishman reflects before       speaking; the Frenchman speaks first and reflects       afterwards--if he has time. The Frenchman converses, the       Englishman talks: and it is the same with respect to       pleasure. Place a Frenchman, who feels _ennui_, by the side       of an Englishman who amuses himself, and it will be the       former who will have the gayest air. From love, the       Englishman only demands its brutal joys; whereas the       Frenchman pays court to a woman. The Englishman, at table,       drinks to repletion; the Frenchman never exceeds       intoxication.         \"A difference equally striking exists between the females of       the two countries. I do not now speak of the beauty of the       type of the one, or the elegance and good taste of the       others; but I will notice one or two great contrasts. In       France, a young girl is reserved, is timid, and as it were       hidden under the shade of the family: but the married woman       has every liberty, and many husbands can tell you that she       does not always use it with extreme moderation! In England,       you are surprised at the confident bearing of young girls,       and the chaste reserve of married women. The former not only       willingly listen to gallant compliments, but even excite       them; whilst the latter, by the simple propriety of their       bearing, impose on the boldest.         \"The boldness of young girls in England was explained to me       by the great emigration of young men--in other words, by the       scarcity of husbands. The French girl who wants a husband is       ordinarily rather disdainful; the English girl is by no       means difficult.         \"A Frenchwoman walks negligently leaning on our arm, and we       regulate our steps by the timidity and uncertainty of hers:       the Englishwoman walks with the head erect, and takes large       strides like a soldier charging. An accident made me       acquainted with the secret of the strange way of walking       which Englishwomen have. I was lately on a visit to the       family of a merchant, whose three daughters are receiving a       costly education. The French master, the drawing master, and       the music master had each given his lesson, when I saw a       sergeant of the grenadiers of the guard arrive. He went into       the garden, and was followed by the young ladies.         \"'Ah! mon Dieu!\" I cried to the father, 'these young ladies       are surely not going to learn the military exercise!'         \"'No,' said he, with a smile.         \"'What, then, has this professor in a red coat come for?'         \"'He is the _master of grace_.\"         \"'What! that grenadier, who is as long as the column in       Trafalgar-square?'         \"'Yes, or rather he is the _walking master_.'         \"I looked out of the window, and saw the three young ladies       drawn up and immovable as soldiers, and presently they began       to march to the step of the grenadier. They formed a       charming platoon, and trod the military step with a       precision worthy of admiration. I asked for an explanation       of such a strange thing.         \"'We in England,' said my host, 'understand better the duty       of women than you Frenchmen do. We cannot regulate our       manner of walking on that of a being subjected to us. Our       dignity forbids it. It is the woman's duty to follow us.       Consequently she must walk as we do,--we can't walk as she       does.'         \"'_Ma foi!_' said I, 'I must admit that in progress you are       decidedly our masters. In France the law, it is true,       commands the wife to follow her husband; but it does not, I       confess, say that she must do so at the rate of a _quick       march_!'         \"The contrasts between the two countries are in truth       inexhaustible. Indeed I defy the most patient observer, to       find any point of resemblance between them. In France,       houses are gay in appearance; in London, with the exception       of some streets in the centre, such as Regent-street or       Oxford-street, they are as dark and dismal as prisons. Our       windows open from the left to the right; windows in England       open from top to bottom. At Paris, to ring or knock too loud       is vulgar and ill-bred; at London, if you don't execute a       tattoo with the knocker or a symphony with the bell, you are       considered a poor wretch, and are left an hour at the door.       Our hack cabs take their stand on one side of the street; in       England they occupy the middle. Our coachmen get up in front       of their vehicles; in England they go behind. In Paris,       Englishmen are charming; at home they are--Englishmen. One       thing astonishes me greatly--that the English don't walk on       their hands, since we walk on our feet.\"    But the French gentlemen do not have it all their own way. The London  _Leader_ attacks them pleasantly in a similar spirit, yet it is always  tinged, upon both sides, with a shade of caustic feeling: \"Jules Janin,  who has fallen in love with our fog and kindliness, announces to all  France the joyful news that there will be no Waterloo banquet this June:  the flag of France floating over the Crystal Palace suggests to the Duke  that the banquet would be a breach of hospitality, because it would  recall such \"cruel souvenirs!\" Janin believes that report; or at least  prints it, which is to give journalistic credence to it. We are sorry to  think how \"cruelly\" France will be disappointed; and we are amused at  the excessive pre-occupation of Frenchmen with this said battle of  Waterloo. It is the ineradicable belief of every Frenchman that we in  England are in a perpetual self-swagger about Waterloo. We are prodigal  of the word upon omnibus, shop, street, and road, because we wish to  humble France at every corner. Waterloo-house is an insult!  Waterloo-bridge a defiance! Wellington boots an outrage! Every step you  take you trample on the national pride of France, for with \"insular  arrogance\" you walk in boots named of Wellington or of Blucher! We are  intoxicated with our success at having beaten the French--never having  drubbed them before, from the times of Cressy, Poictiers, and Agincourt,  down to the Peninsular Campaign! This one success of Waterloo--(which,  after all, was _not_ a success, as France "]]]
