Kimball's Journal (#8)"],[1,"in England a great many of the \"Aikenites\"  embraced the gospel, which caused considerable ill feeling and  opposition among the ministers belonging to that sect.    Having lost quite a number, and seeing that many more were on the eve  of being baptized, one of the ministers came to Preston and announced  that he was going to put down \"Mormonism,\" expose the doctrines and  overthrow the Book of Mormon. He made a very long oration on the  subject, and was very vehement in his manner, and pounded the Book of  Mormon, which he held in his hand, on the pulpit a great many times.  He then exhorted the people to pray that the Lord would drive us from  their coasts, and if the Lord would not hear them in that petition,  that he would smite the leaders.    The next Sunday Elder Hyde and I, being in Preston, went to our meeting  and read the 13th chapter of Corinthians. We strongly urged upon the  Saints the grace of charity, which is so highly spoken of in that  chapter, and took the liberty of making some remarks on the proceedings  of Mr. Aiken, the gentleman who had abused us and the Book of Mormon so  very much a few days before. In return for his railing, we exhorted our  people to pray that the Lord would soften his heart and open his eyes,  that he might see that it was \"hard to kick against the pricks.\"    The discourse had a very good effect, and that week we had the pleasure  of baptizing about fifty into the kingdom of Jesus Christ, a large  number of whom were members of Mr. Aiken's church.    Thus the Lord blessed us exceedingly, notwithstanding the railing and  abuse of the priests, and all things worked together for our good and  the advancement of the cause of truth.    I cannot refrain from relating a circumstance which took place, while  Brother Fielding and I were passing through the village of Chatburn;  having been observed drawing nigh to the town, the news ran from house  to house, and immediately on our arrival, the noise of their looms was  hushed, the people flocked to the doors to welcome us, and see us pass.  The youth of the place ran to meet us, and took hold of our mantles and  then of each other's hands. Several, having hold of hands, went before  us, singing the songs of Zion, while their parents gazed upon the scene  with delight, poured out their blessings upon our heads, and praised  the God of heaven for sending us to unfold the principles of truth and  the plan of salvation to them.    Such a scene, and such gratitude, I never witnessed before. \"Surely,\"  my heart exclaimed, \"out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, thou has  perfected praise!\"    What could have been more pleasing and delightful than such a  manifestation of gratitude to Almighty God from those whose hearts  were deemed too hard to be penetrated by the gospel, and who had been  considered the most wicked and hardened people in that region of  country!    In comparison to the joy I then experienced, the grandeur, pomp and  glory of the kingdoms of this world shrank into insignificance and  appeared as dross, and all the honor of man, aside from the gospel, to  be vain.        CHAPTER VII.    VISIT TO THE MOON FAMILY--PREJUDICED AGAINST OUR DOCTRINE--A PROPHECY  ABOUT THEM--IMPRESSED TO CALL AT THEIR HOUSE AGAIN--MY PRESENCE HAILED  WITH JOY AS AN ANSWER TO PRAYER--THE PROPHECY FULFILLED: THEY JOIN THE  CHURCH--A DREAM AND ITS INTERPRETATION.    Having an appointment to preach in the village of Wrightington, while  on the way I stopped at the house of Brother Amos Fielding. When I  arrived he informed me that a certain family by the name of Moon had  sent a request by him for me to visit them, that they might have  the privilege of conversing with me on the subject of the gospel.  Accordingly, Brother Fielding and I paid them a visit that evening.    We were very kindly received by the family, and had considerable  conversation on the object of my mission to that country, and the great  work of the last days. They listened with attention to my statements,  but they appeared to be prejudiced against them rather than otherwise.  We remained in conversation until a late hour, and then returned.    On our way home, Brother Fielding observed that he thought our visit  had been in vain, as the family seemed to have considerable prejudice.  I replied, \"Brother Fielding, be not faithless, but believing; we shall  yet see great effects from this visit, for I know there are some of the  family who have received the testimony and will shortly manifest the  same.\"    At this remark he appeared surprised.    The next morning I continued my journey to Wrightington, and after  spending two or three days in that vicinity, preaching the gospel, I  returned by the way of Brother Fielding's, with whom I again tarried  for the night.    The next morning I commenced my journey, intending to go direct to  Preston, but when I got opposite the road leading to Mr. Moon's, I  was forcibly impressed by the Spirit of the Lord to call and see them  again. I could not resist, and therefore directed my steps to the  house, not knowing what it meant.    On my arrival at the house, I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Moon from  within exclaimed, \"Come in! come in! you are welcome here! I and the  lasses (meaning her daughters) have just been calling on the Lord, and  praying that He would send you this way.\"    She then informed me of her state of mind since I was there before,  and said she at first rejected my testimony, and endeavored to think  lightly of the things I had advanced, but on trying to pray, she said  that \"the heavens seemed to be like brass over her head, and it was  like iron under her feet.\" She did not know what was the matter, and  exclaimed, \"Certainly the man has not bewitched me!\"    Upon inquiry she found it was the same with the \"lasses.\" They had  begun to reflect on the things I had told them, and, thinking it  possible that I had told them the truth, they resolved to lay the case  before the Lord, and beseech Him to give them a testimony concerning  the things I had testified of.    She then observed, that as soon as they did so, light broke in upon  their minds, they were convinced that I was a messenger of salvation,  and that it was the work of the Lord; and they had resolved to obey the  gospel, which they did, for that evening I baptized father and mother  and four of their daughters.    Shortly after I visited them again, and baptized the remainder of the  family, consisting of thirteen souls, the youngest of whom was over  twenty years of age. They received the gospel as little children,  and rejoiced exceedingly in its blessings. The sons were very good  musicians, and the daughters excellent singers, and when they united  their instruments and their voices in the songs of Zion, the effect was  truly transporting.    Before I left England, there were about thirty of that family and  connections baptized, six of whom were ordained to be fellow-laborers  with us in the vineyard, and I left them rejoicing in the truths they  had embraced.    One night, while at the village of Rochester, I dreamed that I, in  company with another person, was walking out, and saw a very extensive  field of wheat, more so than the eye could reach. Such a sight I never  before witnessed. The wheat appeared to be perfectly ripe, and ready  for harvest. I was very much rejoiced at the glorious sight which  presented itself; but judge of my surprise, when, on taking some of the  ears and rubbing them in my hands, I found nothing but smut. I marveled  exceedingly, and felt very sorrowful, and exclaimed, \"What will the  people do for grain; here is a great appearance of plenty, but there is  no sound wheat!\"    While contemplating the subject, I looked in another direction, and saw  a small field in the form of the letter L, which had the appearance of  something growing in it. I immediately directed my steps to it, and  found that it had been sown with wheat, some of which had grown about  six inches high, other parts of the field not quite so high, and some  had only just sprouted. This gave me great encouragement to expect that  at the harvest there would be some good grain. While thus engaged, a  large bull, very fierce and angry, leaped over the fence, ran through  the field, and stamped down a large quantity of that which had just  sprouted, and after doing considerable injury he leaped over the fence  and ran away.    I felt very much grieved, that so much wheat should be destroyed, when  there was such a prospect of scarcity. When I awoke next morning, the  interpretation was given me. The large field with the great appearance  of grain, so beautiful to look upon, represented the nation in which I  then resided, which had a very pleasing appearance and a great show of  religion, and made great pretensions to piety and godliness, but denied  the power thereof. It was destitute of the principles of truth, and  consequently of the gifts of the spirit.    The small field I saw clearly represented the region of country where  I was laboring, and where the word of truth had taken root, and was  growing in the hearts of those who had the gospel, some places having  grown a little more than others. The village I was in, was that part  of the field where the bull did so much injury, for during my short  visit there, most of the inhabitants were believing, but as soon as  I departed, a clergyman belonging to the church of England, came out  and violently attacked the truth, and made considerable noise, crying,  \"false prophet! delusion!\" and after trampling on truth, and doing  all the mischief he could, before I returned, he took shelter in his  pulpit. However, he did not destroy all the seed, for after my return I  was instrumental in building up a church in that place.        CHAPTER VIII.

No Jews are mad; All Rabbis are Jews.    31.  There are no fish that cannot swim; Some skates are  fish.    32.  All passionate people are unreasonable; Some orators  are passionate.          [See pp. 82-84]            CHAPTER III.    CROOKED ANSWERS.                \"I answered him, as I thought good,               'As many as red-herrings grow in the wood'.\"    __________              1.  Elementary.        1.  Whatever can be \"attributed to\", that is \"said to belong to\",  a Thing, is called an 'Attribute'.  For example, \"baked\", which  can (frequently) be attributed to \"Buns\", and \"beautiful\", which  can (seldom) be attributed to \"Babies\".    2.  When they are the Names of two Things (for example, \"these  Pigs are fat Animals\"), or of two Attributes (for example, \"pink  is light red\").    3.  When one is the Name of a Thing, and the other the Name of an  Attribute (for example, \"these Pigs are pink\"), since a Thing cannot  actually BE an Attribute.    4.  That the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the  end of the sentence (for example, \"these Pigs are pink (Pigs)\").    5.  A 'Proposition' is a sentence stating that some, or none, or all,  of the Things belonging to a certain class, called the 'Subject',  are also Things belonging to a certain other class, called the  'Predicate'.  For example, \"some new Cakes are not nice\", that is  (written in full) \"some new Cakes are not nice Cakes\"; where the  class \"new Cakes\" is the Subject, and the class \"not-nice Cakes\"  is the Predicate.    6.  A Proposition, stating that SOME of the Things belonging to  its Subject are so-and-so, is called 'Particular'.  For example,  \"some new Cakes are nice\", \"some new Cakes are not nice.\"    A Proposition, stating that NONE of the Things belonging to its  Subject, or that ALL of them, are so-and-so, is called 'Universal'.  For example, \"no new Cakes are nice\", \"all new Cakes are not nice\".    7.  The Things in each compartment possess TWO Attributes, whose  symbols will be found written on two of the EDGES of that compartment.    8.  \"One or more.\"    9.  As a name of the class of Things to which the whole Diagram is  assigned.    10.  A Proposition containing two statements.  For example, \"some  new Cakes are nice and some are not-nice.\"    11.  When the whole class, thus divided, is \"exhausted\" among the  sets into which it is divided, there being no member of it which  does not belong to some one of them.  For example, the class \"new  Cakes\" is \"exhaustively\" divided into \"nice\" and \"not-nice\" since  EVERY new Cake must be one or the other.    12.  When a man cannot make up his mind which of two parties he  will join, he is said to be \"sitting on the fence\"--not being able  to decide on which side he will jump down.    13.  \"Some x are y\" and \"no x are y'\".    14.  A Proposition, whose Subject is a single Thing, is called  'Individual'.  For example, \"I am happy\", \"John is not at home\".  These are Universal Propositions, being the same as \"all the I's  that exist are happy\", \"ALL the Johns, that I am now considering,  are not at home\".    15.  Propositions beginning with \"some\" or \"all\".    16.  When they begin with \"some\" or \"no\".  For example, \"some  abc are def\" may be re-arranged as \"some bf are acde\", each being  equivalent to \"some abcdef exist\".    17.  Some tigers are fierce, No tigers are not-fierce.    18.  Some hard-boiled eggs are unwholesome, No hard-boiled  eggs are wholesome.    19.  Some I's are happy, No I's are unhappy.    20.  Some Johns are not at home, No Johns are at home.    21.  The Things, in each compartment of the larger Diagram, possess  THREE Attributes, whose symbols will be found written at three of  the CORNERS of the compartment (except in the case of m', which is  not actually inserted in the Diagram, but is SUPPOSED to stand at  each of its four outer corners).    22.  If the Universe of Things be divided with regard to three  different Attributes; and if two Propositions be given, containing  two different couples of these Attributes; and if from these we  can prove a third Proposition, containing the two Attributes that  have not yet occurred together; the given Propositions are called  'the Premisses', the third one 'the Conclusion', and the whole set  'a Syllogism'.  For example, the Premisses might be \"no m are x'\"  and \"all m' are y\"; and it might be possible to prove from them  a Conclusion containing x and y.    23.  If an Attribute occurs in both Premisses, the Term containing  it is called 'the Middle Term'.  For example, if the Premisses are  \"some m are x\" and \"no m are y'\", the class of \"m-Things\" is 'the  Middle Term.'    If an Attribute occurs in one Premiss, and its contradictory in the  other, the Terms containing them may be called 'the Middle Terms'.  For example, if the Premisses are \"no m are x'\" and \"all m' are  y\", the two classes of \"m-Things\" and \"m'-Things\" may be called  'the Middle Terms'.    24.  Because they can be marked with CERTAINTY: whereas AFFIRMATIVE  Propositions (that is, those that begin with \"some\" or \"all\")  sometimes require us to place a red counter 'sitting on a fence'.    25.  Because the only question we are concerned with is whether the  Conclusion FOLLOWS LOGICALLY from the Premisses, so that, if THEY  were true, IT also would be true.    26.  By understanding a red counter to mean \"this compartment CAN  be occupied\", and a grey one to mean \"this compartment CANNOT be  occupied\" or \"this compartment MUST be empty\".    27.  'Fallacious Premisses' and 'Fallacious Conclusion'.    28.  By finding, when we try to transfer marks from the larger  Diagram to the smaller, that there is 'no information' for any of  its four compartments.    29.  By finding the correct Conclusion, and then observing that  the Conclusion, offered to us, is neither identical with it nor a  part of it.    30.  When the offered Conclusion is PART of the correct Conclusion.  In this case, we may call it a 'Defective Conclusion'.          2.  Half of Smaller Diagram.
