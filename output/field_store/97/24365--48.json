The unwieldy leviathans could not be shifted from their moorings, and  they lay helpless and immovable, and yet dangerous to their neighbours;  for they were filled with the instruments of destruction. Early the next  morning eight of these vaunted batteries \"indicated the efficacy of the  red-hot defence. The light produced by the flames was nearly equal to  noonday, and greatly exposed the enemy to observation, enabling the  artillery to be pointed upon them with the utmost precision. The rock and  neighbouring objects are stated to have been highly illuminated by the  constant flashes of cannon and the flames of the burning ships, forming a  mingled scene of sublimity and terror.\"(13) \"An indistinct clamour, with  lamentable cries and groans, arose from all quarters.\"(14)    When 400 pieces of artillery were playing on the rock at the same moment,  Elliott returned the compliment with a shower of red-hot balls, bombs, and  carcases, that filled the air, with little or no intermission. The Count  d'Artois had hastened from Paris to witness a capitulation. He arrived in  time to see the total destruction of the floating batteries and a large  part of the combined fleet. Attempting a somewhat feeble joke, he wrote to  France:--\"_La batterie la plus effective etait ma batterie de cuisine_.\"  Elliott's cooking-apparatus and \"roasted balls\" beat it all to nothing.  Red-hot shot has been entirely superseded in \"civilised\" warfare by  shells. It was usually handled much in the same way that ordinary shot and  shell is to-day. Each ball was carried by two men, having between them a  strong iron frame, with a ring in the middle to hold it. There were two  heavy wads, one dry and the other slightly damped, between the powder and  ball. At the siege of Gibraltar, however, matters were managed in a much  more rough-and-ready style. The shot was heated at furnaces and wheeled  off to the guns in wheelbarrows lined with sand.                      [Illustration: THE SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR]    The partial failure of the navy to co-operate successfully with the  land-forces, so far as bombardment was concerned, during the Crimean war,  has had much to do with the adoption of the costly ironclad floating  fortresses, armed with enormously powerful guns, of the present day. The  earliest form, indeed, was adopted during the above war, but not used to  any great extent or advantage. The late Emperor of the French(15) saw that  the coming necessity or necessary evil would be some form of  strongly-armoured and protected floating battery that could cope with  fortresses ashore, and this was the germ of the ironclad movement. The  first batteries of this kind, used successfully at Kinburn, were otherwise  unseaworthy and unmanageable, and were little more than heavily-plated and  more or less covered barges.    The two earliest European ironclads were _La Gloire_ in France and the  _Warrior_ in England--the latter launched in 1860. Neither of these vessels  presented any great departure from the established types of build in large  ships of war. The _Warrior_ is an undeniably fine, handsome-looking  frigate, masted and rigged as usual, but she and her sister-ship, the  _Black Prince_, are about the only ironclads to which these remarks  apply--every form and variety of construction having been adopted since. As  regarded size, she was considerably larger than the largest frigate or  ship of the line of our navy, although greatly exceeded by many ironclads  subsequently built. She is 380 feet in length, and her displacement of  more than 9,100 tons was 3,000 tons greater than that of the largest of  the wooden men-of-war she was superseding. The _Warrior_ is still among  the fastest of the iron-armoured fleet. Considered _as_ an ironclad,  however, she is a weak example. Her armour, which protects only  three-fifths of her sides, is but four and a half inches thick, with  eighteen inches of (wood) backing, and five-eighths of an inch of what is  technically called \"skin-plating,\" for protection inside. The remote  possibility of a red-hot shot or shell falling inside has to be  considered. Her bow and stern, rudder-head and steering-gear, would, of  course, be the vulnerable points.    From this small beginning--one armoured vessel--our ironclad fleet has grown  with the greatest rapidity, till it now numbers over sixty of all  denominations of vessels. The late Emperor of the French gave a great  impetus to the movement; and other foreign nations speedily following in  his wake, it clearly behoved England to be able to cope with them on their  own ground, should occasion demand. Then there was the \"scare\" of invasion  which took some hold of the public mind, and was exaggerated by certain  portions of the press, at one period, till it assumed serious proportions.  Leading journals complained that by the time the Admiralty would have one  or two ironclads in commission, the French would have ten or twelve. Thus  urged, the Government of the day must be excused if they made some  doubtful experiments and costly failures.    But apart from the lessons of the Crimea, and the activity and rivalry of  foreign powers, attention was seriously drawn to the ironclad question by  the events of the day. It was easy to guess and theorise concerning this  new feature in warfare, but early in 1862 practical proof was afforded of  its power. The naval engagement which took place in Hampton Roads, near  the outset of the great American civil war, was the first time in which an  ironclad ship was brought into collision with wooden vessels, and also the  first time in which two distinct varieties of the species were brought  into collision with each other.    The Southerners had, when the strife commenced, seized and partially  burned the _Merrimac_, a steam-frigate belonging to the United States  navy, then lying at the Norfolk Navy-yard. The hulk was regarded as nearly  worthless,(16) until, looking about for ways and means to annoy their  opponents, they hit on the idea of armouring her, in the best manner  attainable at the moment; and for awhile at least, this condemned wreck,  resuscitated, patched up, and covered with iron plates,(17) became the  terror of the enemy. She was provided with an iron prow or ram capable of  inflicting a severe blow under water. Her hull, cut down to within three  feet of the water-line, was covered by a bomb-proof, sloping-roofed house,  which extended over the screw and rudder. This was built of oak and pine,  covered with iron; the latter being four and a half inches thick, and the  former aggregating twenty inches in thickness. While the hull was  generally iron-plated, the bow and stern were covered with steel. There  were no masts--nothing seen above but the \"smoke-stack\" (funnel),  pilot-house, and flagstaff. She carried eight powerful guns, most of them  eleven-inch. \"As she came ploughing through the water,\" wrote one  eyewitness of her movements, \"she looked like a huge half-submerged  crocodile.\" The Southerners re-christened her the _Virginia_, but her  older name has clung to her. The smaller vessels with her contributed  little to the issue of the fight, but those opposed to her were of no  inconsiderable size. The _Congress_, _Cumberland_, _Minnesota_, and  _Roanoake_ were frigates carrying an aggregate of over 150 guns and nearly  2,000 men. They, however, were wooden vessels; and although, in two cases  in particular, defended with persistent heroism, had no chance against the  ironclad, hastily as she had been prepared. There is little doubt that the  officers of the two former vessels, in particular, knew something of the  nature of the \"forlorn hope\" in which they were about to engage, when she  hove in sight on that memorable 8th of March, 1862. It is said that the  sailors, however, derided her till she was close upon them--so close that  their laughter and remarks were heard on board. \"That Southern Bugaboo,\"  \"that old Secesh curiosity,\" were among the milder titles applied to her.                     [Illustration: THE ORIGINAL \"MERRIMAC.\"]    The engagement was fought in the Hampton Roads, which is virtually an  outlet of the James River, Virginia. The latter, like the Thames, has  considerable breadth and many shallows near its mouth. The _Merrimac_ left  Norfolk Navy-yard (which holds to the James River somewhat the position  that Sheerness does to the Thames) hurriedly on the morning of the 8th,  and steamed steadily towards the enemy's fleet, accompanied by some  smaller vessels of war and a few tug-boats.      \"Meanwhile, the shapeless iron mass        Came moving o'er the wave,    As gloomy as a passing hearse,        As silent as the grave.\"    The morning was still and calm as that of a Sabbath-day. That the  _Merrimac_ was not expected was evidenced by the boats at the booms, and  the sailors' clothes still hanging in the rigging of the enemy's vessels.  \"Did they see the long, dark hull? Had they made it out? Was it ignorance,  apathy, or composure that made them so indifferent? or were they provided  with torpedoes, which could sink even the _Merrimac_ in a minute?\" were  questions mooted on the Southern side by those watching on board the boats  and from the shore.    As soon, however, as she was plainly discerned, the crews of the  _Cumberland_, _Congress_, and other vessels were beat to quarters, and  preparations made for the fight. \"The engagement,\" wrote the Confederate  Secretary of the Navy, \"commenced at half-past three p.m., and at four  p.m. Captain Buchanan had sunk the _Cumberland_, captured and burned the  _Congress_, disabled and driven the _Minnesota_ ashore, and defeated the  _St. Lawrence_ and _Roanoake_, which sought shelter under the guns of  Fortress Monroe. Two of the enemy's small steamers were blown up, and the  two transport steamers were captured.\" This, as will be seen, must, as  regards time, be taken _cum grano"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39372"],[0,"The Recent Mammals of Tamaulipas, México (#8)"],[1," of Piedra  (54917) has a supernumerary tooth lingual and anterior to the last  upper molar.

Mus., 205:8, March 3.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from along eastern       side of Sierra Madre Oriental, north to vicinity of La       Purisima.    In Tamaulipas, the four-eyed opossum is seemingly common at relatively  low elevations in the Tropical Deciduous Forest along the eastern side  of the Sierra Madre Oriental, but the species is not restricted to this  area as one specimen is available from a place seven kilometers  southwest of La Purisima, in the drier forest of west-central  Tamaulipas. The highest elevation at which individuals have been taken  in the state is approximately 2500 feet.    Specimens obtained two kilometers west of El Carrizo were caught in  steel traps that were baited with the bodies of small birds and mammals  and that were set in trails leading through a fence of piled logs that  separated a cornfield from adjacent forest. At Rancho Pano Ayuctle,  some individuals were trapped in steel sets baited with scraps of meat;  others were shot at night in the forest along the Rio Sabinas.  Schaldach reported in his notes that four-eyed opossums robbed trap  lines set for small mammals at Rancho Pano Ayuctle. W. W. Dalquest  trapped an individual seven kilometers southwest of La Purisima using  the body of an armadillo as bait. The natives of southern Tamaulipas  refer to this animal as \"tlacuache cuatrojos.\"    Tamaulipan specimens of _P. o. pallidus_ differ from topotypes and  other specimens from the vicinity of the type locality in averaging  somewhat paler dorsally and slightly smaller in cranial dimensions when  specimens of equal age are compared. They differ also in having a  longer terminal area of white on the tail, 53.1 per cent (43.3-62.8) of  the length of the tail in 13 specimens from Tamaulipas, and 38.7  (30.9-48.2) per cent in 14 specimens from the vicinity of the type  locality of _pallidus_ in Veracruz; specimens from northern Veracruz  are intermediate between the two mentioned populations in amount of  white on the tail. Baker (1951:210) noted that the specimens from two  kilometers west of El Carrizo had \"proportionately longer tails than  typical _P. o. pallidus_ from central Veracruz,\" but I do not find this  character to be consistent in the more abundant material now available.         _Measurements._--External and cranial measurements of three       adults, a male and female from Rancho Pano Ayuctle and a       male from two kilometers west of El Carrizo, respectively,       are as follows: 577, 580, 568; 294, 288, 290; 46, 43, 43;       40, 42, 37; condylobasal length, ----, 70.1, 69.9; palatal       length, 43.2, 42.3, 41.9; lambdoidal breadth, 23.6, 22.0,       22.7; alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 29.5, 28.4,       29.0.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 15: 7 km.

The only report from Tamaulipas of this small shrew is that of Goodwin  (1954:3) who listed a cranium and mandible, possibly of the same  individual, found on the floor of a cave.

Fauna,       10:32, Dec. 31.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas_.--Known only from two       localities in southwestern part of state.    The two specimens examined were collected in July, one in tropical  forest and the other in pine-oak forest; each was a lactating female  and each weighed 5 grams.    Judging from Merriam's (1895:32) description, the two females differ  from the type and three specimens from San Diego, Texas, in having a  unicolored tail and in being slightly larger externally. When more  abundant material is available the _Notiosorex crawfordi_ of  northeastern Mexico probably will be found to represent a new  subspecies; for the present I follow Findley (1955:616) in referring  Tamaulipan specimens to _N. crawfordi_.         _Measurements._--External measurements of the specimens from       Jaumave and Palmillas, respectively: 90, 90; 28, 31; 11,       11.5; 8, 8.
