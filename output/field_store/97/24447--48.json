[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#8)"],[1,"ARGUMENT.[Note: Vide sect. iii. and vii.]--REFUTATION  OF LOCKE.--All our ideas, sensations, notions, or the things which we  perceive, by whatsoever names they may be distinguished, are visibly  inactive--there is nothing of power or agency included in them. So that  ONE IDEA or object of thought CANNOT PRODUCE or make ANY ALTERATION IN  ANOTHER. To be satisfied of the truth of this, there is nothing else  requisite but a bare observation of our ideas. For, since they and every  part of them exist only in the mind, it follows that there is nothing in  them but what is perceived: but whoever shall attend to his ideas, whether  of sense or reflexion, will not perceive in them any power or activity;  there is, therefore, no such thing contained in them. A little  attention will discover to us that the very being of an idea implies  passiveness and inertness in it, insomuch that it is impossible for an  idea to do anything, or, strictly speaking, to be the cause of anything:  neither can it be the resemblance or pattern of any active being, as is  evident from sect. 8. Whence it plainly follows that extension,  figure, and motion cannot be the cause of our sensations. To say,  therefore, that these are the effects of powers resulting from the  configuration, number, motion, and size of corpuscles, must certainly  be false. [Note: Vide sect. cii.]    26. CAUSE OF IDEAS.--We perceive a continual succession of ideas, some are  anew excited, others are changed or totally disappear. There is therefore  some cause of these ideas, whereon they depend, and which produces and  changes them. That this cause cannot be any quality or idea or combination  of ideas, is clear from the preceding section. It must therefore be a  substance; but it has been shown that there is no corporeal or material  substance: it remains therefore that the CAUSE OF IDEAS is an incorporeal  active substance or Spirit.    27. NO IDEA OF SPIRIT.--A spirit is one simple, undivided, active  being--as it perceives ideas it is called the UNDERSTANDING, and as it  produces or otherwise operates about them it is called the WILL. Hence  there can be no idea formed of a soul or spirit; for all ideas whatever,  being passive and inert (vide sect. 25), they cannot represent unto us,  by way of image or LIKENESS, that which acts. A little attention will make  it plain to any one, that to have an idea which shall be like that active  principle of motion and change of ideas is absolutely impossible. Such is  the nature of SPIRIT, or that which acts, that it cannot be of itself  perceived, BUT ONLY BY THE EFFECTS WHICH IT PRODUCETH. If any man shall  doubt of the truth of what is here delivered, let him but reflect and try  if he can frame the idea of any power or active being, and whether he has  ideas of two principal powers, marked by the names WILL and UNDERSTANDING,  distinct from each other as well as from a third idea of Substance or  Being in general, with a relative notion of its supporting or being the  subject of the aforesaid powers--which is signified by the name SOUL or  SPIRIT. This is what some hold; but, so far as I can see, the words  WILL [Note: \"Understanding, mind.\"--Edit 1710.], SOUL, SPIRIT, do not stand  for different ideas, or, in truth, for any idea at all, but for something  which is very different from ideas, and which, being an agent, cannot be  like unto, or represented by, any idea whatsoever. Though it must be owned  at the same time that we have some notion of soul, spirit, and the  operations of the mind: such as willing, loving, hating--inasmuch as we  know or understand the meaning of these words.    28. I find I can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure, and vary and shift  the scene as oft as I think fit. It is no more than willing, and  straightway this or that idea arises in my fancy; and by the same power  it is obliterated and makes way for another. This making and unmaking of  ideas doth very properly denominate the mind active. Thus much is certain  and grounded on experience; but when we think of unthinking agents or of  exciting ideas exclusive of volition, we only amuse ourselves with words.    29. IDEAS OF SENSATION DIFFER FROM THOSE OF REFLECTION OR MEMORY.--But,  whatever power I may have over MY OWN thoughts, I find the ideas  actually perceived by Sense have not a like dependence on my will. When  in broad daylight I open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether  I shall see or no, or to determine what particular objects shall present  themselves to my view; and so likewise as to the hearing and other  senses; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will. There  is THEREFORE SOME OTHER WILL OR SPIRIT that PRODUCES THEM.    30. LAWS OF NATURE.--The ideas of Sense are more strong, lively, and  DISTINCT than those of the imagination; they have likewise a steadiness,  order, and coherence, and are not excited at random, as those which are  the effects of human wills often are, but in a regular train or series,  the admirable connexion whereof sufficiently testifies the wisdom and  benevolence of its Author. Now THE SET RULES OR ESTABLISHED METHODS  WHEREIN THE MIND WE DEPEND ON EXCITES IN US THE IDEAS OF SENSE, ARE CALLED  THE LAWS OF NATURE; and these we learn by experience, which teaches us  that such and such ideas are attended with such and such other ideas, in  the ordinary course of things.    31. KNOWLEDGE OF THEM NECESSARY FOR THE CONDUCT OF WORLDLY AFFAIRS.--This  gives us a sort of foresight which enables us to regulate our  actions for the benefit of life. And without this we should be eternally  at a loss; we could not know how to act anything that might procure us  the least pleasure, or remove the least pain of sense. That food  nourishes, sleep refreshes, and fire warms us; that to sow in the  seed-time is the way to reap in the harvest; and in general that to  obtain such or such ends, such or such means are conducive--all this we  know, NOT BY DISCOVERING ANY NECESSARY CONNEXION BETWEEN OUR IDEAS, but  only by the observation of the settled laws of nature, without which we  should be all in uncertainty and confusion, and a grown man no more know  how to manage himself in the affairs of life than an infant just born.    32. And yet THIS consistent UNIFORM WORKING, which so evidently displays  the goodness and wisdom of that Governing Spirit whose Will constitutes  the laws of nature, is so far from leading our thoughts to Him, that it  rather SENDS THEM A WANDERING AFTER SECOND CAUSES. For, when we perceive  certain ideas of Sense constantly followed by other ideas and WE KNOW  THIS IS NOT OF OUR OWN DOING, we forthwith attribute power and agency to  the ideas themselves, and make one the cause of another, than which  nothing can be more absurd and unintelligible. Thus, for example, having  observed that when we perceive by sight a certain round luminous figure  we at the same time perceive by touch the idea or sensation called HEAT,  we do from thence conclude the sun to be the cause of heat. And in like  manner perceiving the motion and collision of bodies to be attended with  sound, we are inclined to think the latter the effect of the former.    33. OF REAL THINGS AND IDEAS OR CHIMERAS.--The ideas imprinted on the  Senses by the Author of nature are called REAL THINGS; and those  excited in the imagination being less regular, vivid, and constant,  are more properly termed IDEAS, or IMAGES OF THINGS, which they  copy and represent. But then our sensations, be they never so vivid  and distinct, are nevertheless IDEAS, that is, they exist in the  mind, or are perceived by it, as truly as the ideas of its own framing.  The ideas of Sense are allowed to have more reality in them, that is, to  be more (1)STRONG, (2)ORDERLY, and (3)COHERENT than the creatures of the  mind; but this is no argument that they exist without the mind. They are  also (4)LESS DEPENDENT ON THE SPIRIT [Note: Vide sect. xxix.--Note.],  or thinking substance which perceives them, in that they are excited by  the will of another and more powerful spirit; yet still they are IDEAS,  and certainly no IDEA, whether faint or strong, can exist otherwise than  in a mind perceiving it.    34. FIRST GENERAL OBJECTION.--ANSWER.--Before we proceed any farther  it is necessary we spend some time in answering objections which  may probably be made against the principles we have hitherto laid  down. In doing of which, if I seem too prolix to those of quick  apprehensions, I hope it may be pardoned, since all men do not  equally apprehend things of this nature, and I am willing to be  understood by every one.    FIRST, then, it will be objected that by the foregoing principles ALL  THAT IS REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL IN NATURE IS BANISHED OUT OF THE WORLD, and  instead thereof a chimerical scheme of ideas takes place. All things that  exist, exist only in the mind, that is, they are purely notional. What  therefore becomes of the sun, moon and stars? What must we think of  houses, rivers, mountains, trees, stones; nay, even of our own bodies?  Are all these but so many chimeras and illusions on the fancy? To all  which, and whatever else of the same sort may be objected, I ANSWER, that  by the principles premised we are not deprived of any one thing in  nature. Whatever we see, feel, hear, or anywise conceive or understand  remains as secure as ever, and is as real as ever. There is a RERUM  NATURA, and the distinction between realities and chimeras retains its  full force. This is evident from sect. 29, 30, and 33, where we have  shown what is meant by REAL THINGS in opposition to CHIMERAS or ideas of  our own framing; but then they both equally exist in the mind, and in  that sense they are alike IDEAS.    35. THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER, AS UNDERSTOOD BY PHILOSOPHERS,  DENIED.[Vide sect. lxxxiv.]--I do not argue against the existence of  any one thing that we can apprehend either by sense or reflexion.  That the things I see with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4724"],[0,"Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics and (#8)"],[1,"y) by my senses.    PHIL.  It seems then you will have our ideas, which alone are  immediately perceived, to be pictures of external things: and that these  also are perceived by sense, inasmuch as they have a conformity or  resemblance to our ideas?    HYL.  That is my meaning.    PHIL.  And, in the same way that Julius Caesar, in himself invisible, is  nevertheless perceived by sight; real things, in themselves  imperceptible, are perceived by sense.    HYL.  In the very same.    PHIL.  Tell me, Hylas, when you behold the picture of Julius Caesar, do  you see with your eyes any more than some colours and figures, with a  certain symmetry and composition of the whole?    HYL.  Nothing else.    PHIL.  And would not a man who had never known anything of Julius Caesar  see as much?    HYL.  He would.    PHIL.  Consequently he hath his sight, and the use of it, in as perfect  a degree as you?    HYL.  I agree with you.    PHIL.  Whence comes it then that your thoughts are directed to the Roman  emperor, and his are not? This cannot proceed from the sensations or  ideas of sense by you then perceived; since you acknowledge you have no  advantage over him in that respect. It should seem therefore to proceed  from reason and memory: should it not?    HYL.  It should.    PHIL.  Consequently, it will not follow from that instance that anything  is perceived by sense which is not, immediately perceived. Though I grant  we may, in one acceptation, be said to perceive sensible things mediately  by sense: that is, when, from a frequently perceived connexion, the  immediate perception of ideas by one sense SUGGESTS to the mind others,  perhaps belonging to another sense, which are wont to be connected with  them. For instance, when I hear a coach drive along the streets,  immediately I perceive only the sound; but, from the experience I have  had that such a sound is connected with a coach, I am said to hear the  coach. It is nevertheless evident that, in truth and strictness, nothing  can be HEARD BUT SOUND; and the coach is not then properly perceived by  sense, but suggested from experience. So likewise when we are said to see  a red-hot bar of iron; the solidity and heat of the iron are not the  objects of sight, but suggested to the imagination by the colour and  figure which are properly perceived by that sense. In short, those things  alone are actually and strictly perceived by any sense, which would have  been perceived in case that same sense had then been first conferred on  us. As for other things, it is plain they are only suggested to the mind  by experience, grounded on former perceptions. But, to return to your  comparison of Caesar's picture, it is plain, if you keep to that, you  must hold the real things, or archetypes of our ideas, are not perceived  by sense, but by some internal faculty of the soul, as reason or memory.  I would therefore fain know what arguments you can draw from reason for  the existence of what you call REAL THINGS OR MATERIAL OBJECTS. Or,  whether you remember to have seen them formerly as they are in  themselves; or, if you have heard or read of any one that did.    HYL.  I see, Philonous, you are disposed to raillery; but that will  never convince me.    PHIL.  My aim is only to learn from you the way to come at the knowledge  of MATERIAL BEINGS. Whatever we perceive is perceived immediately or  mediately: by sense, or by reason and reflexion. But, as you have  excluded sense, pray shew me what reason you have to believe their  existence; or what MEDIUM you can possibly make use of to prove it,  either to mine or your own understanding.    HYL.  To deal ingenuously, Philonous, now I consider the point, I do not  find I can give you any good reason for it. But, thus much seems pretty  plain, that it is at least possible such things may really exist. And, as  long as there is no absurdity in supposing them, I am resolved to believe  as I did, till you bring good reasons to the contrary.    PHIL.  What! Is it come to this, that you only BELIEVE the existence  of material objects, and that your belief is founded barely on the  possibility of its being true? Then you will have me bring reasons  against it: though another would think it reasonable the proof should lie  on him who holds the affirmative. And, after all, this very point which  you are now resolved to maintain, without any reason, is in effect what  you have more than once during this discourse seen good reason to give  up. But, to pass over all this; if I understand you rightly, you say our  ideas do not exist without the mind, but that they are copies, images, or  representations, of certain originals that do?    HYL.  You take me right.    PHIL.  They are then like external things?    HYL.  They are.    PHIL.  Have those things a stable and permanent nature, independent of  our senses; or are they in a perpetual change, upon our producing any  motions in our bodies--suspending, exerting, or altering, our faculties  or organs of sense?    HYL.  Real things, it is plain, have a fixed and real nature, which  remains the same notwithstanding any change in our senses, or in the  posture and motion of our bodies; which indeed may affect the ideas in  our minds, but it were absurd to think they had the same effect on things  existing without the mind.    PHIL.  How then is it possible that things perpetually fleeting and  variable as our ideas should be copies or images of anything fixed and  constant? Or, in other words, since all sensible qualities, as  size, figure, colour, &c., that is, our ideas, are continually changing,  upon every alteration in the distance, medium, or instruments of  sensation; how can any determinate material objects be properly  represented or painted forth by several distinct things, each of which is  so different from and unlike the rest? Or, if you say it resembles some  one only of our ideas, how shall we be able to distinguish the true copy  from all the false ones?    HYL.  I profess, Philonous, I am at a loss. I know not what to say to  this.    PHIL.  But neither is this all. Which are material objects in  themselves--perceptible or imperceptible?    HYL.  Properly and immediately nothing can be perceived but ideas. All  material things, therefore, are in themselves insensible, and to be  perceived only by our ideas.    PHIL.  Ideas then are sensible, and their archetypes or originals  insensible?    HYL.  Right.    PHIL.  But how can that which is sensible be like that which is  insensible? Can a real thing, in itself INVISIBLE, be like a COLOUR;  or a real thing, which is not AUDIBLE, be like a SOUND? In a word,  can anything be like a sensation or idea, but another sensation or idea?    HYL.  I must own, I think not.    PHIL.  Is it possible there should be any doubt on the point? Do you  not perfectly know your own ideas?    HYL.  I know them perfectly; since what I do not perceive or know can be  no part of my idea.    PHIL.  Consider, therefore, and examine them, and then tell me if there  be anything in them which can exist without the mind: or if you can  conceive anything like them existing without the mind.    HYL.  Upon inquiry, I find it is impossible for me to conceive or  understand how anything but an idea can be like an idea. And it is most  evident that NO IDEA CAN EXIST WITHOUT THE MIND.    PHIL.  You are therefore, by your principles, forced to deny the  REALITY of sensible things; since you made it to consist in an absolute  existence exterior to the mind. That is to say, you are a downright  sceptic. So I have gained my point, which was to shew your principles led  to Scepticism.    HYL.  For the present I am, if not entirely convinced, at least  silenced.    PHIL.  I would fain know what more you would require in order to a  perfect conviction. Have you not had the liberty of explaining yourself  all manner of ways? Were any little slips in discourse laid hold and  insisted on? Or were you not allowed to retract or reinforce anything you  had offered, as best served your purpose? Hath not everything you could  say been heard and examined with all the fairness imaginable? In a word  have you not in every point been convinced out of your own mouth? And, if  you can at present discover any flaw in any of your former concessions,  or think of any remaining subterfuge, any new distinction, colour, or  comment whatsoever, why do you not produce it?    HYL.  A little patience, Philonous. I am at present so amazed to see  myself ensnared, and as it were imprisoned in the labyrinths you have  drawn me into, that on the sudden it cannot be expected I should find my  way out. You must give me time to look about me and recollect myself.    PHIL.  Hark; is not this the college bell?    HYL.  It rings for prayers.    PHIL.  We will go in then, if you please, and meet here again tomorrow  morning. In the meantime, you may employ your thoughts on this morning's  discourse, and try if you can find any fallacy in it, or invent any new  means to extricate yourself.    HYL.  Agreed.          THE SECOND DIALOGUE      HYL.  I beg your pardon, Philonous, for not meeting you sooner. All  this morning my head was so filled with our late conversation that I had  not leisure to think of the time of the day, or indeed of anything else.    PHILONOUS.  I am glad you were so intent upon it, in hopes if there were  any mistakes in your concessions, or fallacies in my reasonings from  them, you will now discover them to me.    HYL.  I assure you I have done nothing ever since I saw you but search  after mistakes and fallacies, and, with that view, have minutely examined  the whole series of yesterday's discourse: but all in vain, for the  notions it led me into, upon review, appear still more clear and evident;  and, the more I consider them, the more irresistibly do they force my  assent.    PHIL.  And is not this, think you, a sign that they are genuine, that  they proceed from nature, and are"]]]
