Do      not forget me, Little Billee. I shall see you often in the      future, but I doubt if you will see me. I am not going to return      to Twenty-Third Street again, but shall continue my work in the      Land of Yule, in the Palace of Good-Will, whose beautiful      windows look out upon the homes of all good children.        Good-by, Little Billee, and the happiest of happy Christmases to      you and all of yours.            Affectionately,              SANTA CLAUS.    When Little Billee's mama read this to him that Christmas morning, a  stray little tear ran down her cheek and fell upon Little Billee's  hand.    \"Why, what are you crying for, mama?\" he asked.    \"With happiness, my dear little son,\" his mother answered. \"I was afraid  yesterday that I might have lost my little boy forever, but now--\"    \"You have an extra one thrown in for Christmas, haven't you?\" said  Little Billee, taking his new playmate by the hand. The visitor smiled  back at him with a smile so sweet that anybody might have guessed that  he was the son of Santa Claus.    As for the latter, Little Billee has not seen him again; but down at his  father's bank there is a new messenger, named John, who has a voice so  like Santa Claus's voice that whenever Little Billee goes down there in  the motor to ride home at night with his papa, he runs into the bank  and has a long talk with him, just for the pleasure of pretending that  it is Santa Claus he is talking to. Indeed, the voice is so like that  once a sudden and strange idea flashed across Little Billee's mind.    \"Have you ever been on Twenty-Third Street, John?\" he asked.    \"Twenty-Third Street?\" replied the messenger, scratching his head as if  very much puzzled. \"What's that?\"    \"Why, it's a street,\" said Little Billee rather vaguely.    \"Well, to tell you the truth, Billee,\" said John, \"I've heard tell of  Twenty-Third Street, and they say it is a very beautiful and interesting  spot. But, you know, I don't get much chance to travel. I've been too  busy all my life to go abroad.\"    \"Abroad!\" roared Little Billee, grinning at John's utterly absurd  mistake. \"Why, Twenty-Third Street ain't abroad! It's up-town--near--oh,  near--Twenty-Second Street.\"    \"Really?\" returned John, evidently tremendously surprised. \"Well, well,  well! Who'd have thought that? Well, if that's the case, some time when  I get a week off I'll have to go and spend my vacation there!\"    From which Little Billee concluded that his suspicion that John might be  Santa Claus in disguise was entirely without foundation in fact.          CHRISTMAS EVE          Slyly twinkling in the skies,        Peeping from the Heaven's blue,      Are a million starry eyes        Smiling, Sweetheart, down on you;      Peeping through the misty gauze        From their little homes above      While we wait for Santa Claus        With his gifts of Cheer and Love.          Hush-a-by, my Baby O!            Santa Claus is on the way,          And his sledges overflow            With the sweets of Christmas Day.              Lull-a-by!              Hush-a-by, my Baby O.        Santa Claus is coming by        With his pack of pretty toys.      Fast his speedy rein-deer fly        With their load of Christmas joys.      Now they flit across the moon,        Now they flicker o'er the gold--      We shall hear their patter soon        On the roof-tops crisp and cold.          Hush-a-by, my Baby O!            Soon will sound the merry horn          That will usher in the glow            Of the golden Christmas morn.              Lull-a-by!              Hush-a-by, my Baby O.        Meet him half-way, Baby dear--        Join the jolly pranksome band      Of the Elf-men with their cheer        Waiting there in Slumberland.      Santa Claus must come along        Through the dreamy vales of Sleep.      There with all the Fairy throng        Let us too our vigil keep.          Hush-a-by, my Baby O.            Haste to Slumberland away,          Where the Fairy children go            On the Eve of Christmas Day.              Lull-a-by!              Hush-a-by, my Baby O.          THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN SANTAS      For once the weather bureau had scored a good, clean hit. The bull's-eye  was pierced squarely in the middle, and the promised blizzard falling  upon the city at noon held the metropolis completely in its grip.  Everything in the line of public transportation in and out of the town  was tied up so tightly that it did not seem possible that it would ever  be unraveled again. The snow was piling waist high upon the streets, and  the cutting winds played their fantastic pranks with a chill and cruel  persistence.    It was with great difficulty that Dobbleigh made his way into the Grand  Central Railway Station. Like other suburban commuters at Christmas  time, he was heavily laden with bundles of one kind and another. He  fairly oozed packages. They stuck out of the pockets of his heavy  ulster. A half dozen fastened together with a heavy cord he carried in  his right hand, and some were slung about his shoulders, and held there  by means of a leathern strap. The real truth was that Dobbleigh had been  either too busy, or had forgotten the wise resolutions of the autumn,  and had failed to do his Christmas shopping early, with the result that  now, on Christmas Eve, he was returning to the little Dobbleighs with a  veritable Santa Claus' pack, whose contents were designed to delight  their eyes in the early hours of the coming morning.    It was with a great sense of relief that he entered the vast waiting  room of the station, and shook the accumulated snow from his coat, and  removed the infant icicles from his eyes, but his joy was short-lived.  Making his way to the door, he paused to wish the venerable doorman a  Merry Christmas.    \"Fierce night, Hawkins,\" he said, as he readjusted his packages. \"I  shall be glad enough to get home.\"    The old man shook his head dubiously.    \"I'm afraid you won't enjoy that luxury to-night, Mr. Dobbleigh,\" he  said. \"We haven't been able to get a train out of here since one  o'clock, and the way things look now there won't be any business at this  stand for twenty-four hours, even if we have luck.\"    \"What's that?\" returned Dobbleigh. \"You don't mean to say--\"    \"No trains out to-night, sir,\" said the doorman. \"The line's out of  commission from here to Buffalo, anyhow, and nobody knows what's going  on west of there. The wires are down, and we're completely shut off from  the world.\"    Dobbleigh gave a long, low whistle.    \"By Jove, Hawkins,\" he muttered ruefully. \"That's tough.\"    \"Kind o' hard on the kiddies, eh?\" said the old doorman sympathetically.    \"Mighty hard,\" said Dobbleigh, with a catch in his voice. \"No chance of  anything--not even a freight?\" he went on anxiously.    \"Couldn't pull a feather through with thirty locomotives,\" was the  disheartening response. \"I guess it's the hotel for yours to-night,  sir.\"    Dobbleigh turned away, and pondered deeply for a few moments. Taking  care of himself for the night was not, under the circumstances, a very  difficult proposition, for his club was not far away, so that he was not  confronted with the uncomfortable prospect of sleeping on the benches  of the railway station, but the idea of the little Dobbleighs not  finding their treasures awaiting them on the morrow, to say nothing of  the anxiety of Mrs. Dobbleigh over his non-arrival, was, to say the  least, disconcerting.    \"Oh, well,\" he said philosophically, after going over the pros and cons  of the situation carefully, \"what's the use of worrying? What must be  must be, and I'll have to make the best of it.\"    He buttoned his heavy coat up snugly about his neck, and, seizing his  bundles with a firmer grip, wished the old doorman a good night, and  went out again into the storm. Fifteen minutes later, looking more like  a snowman than an ordinary human being, he entered the club, and, if it  be true that misery finds comfort in company, he was not doomed to go  without consolation. There were five other fellow-sufferers there trying  to make the best of it.    \"Hello, Dobby,\" cried his friend and neighbor, Grantham. \"What's  happened to you--an eighteen-karat family man spending his Christmas Eve  at a club? Shame on you!\"    \"I am duly repentant, Gran,\" replied Dobbleigh, \"but you see, as your  neighbor, I felt it my duty to keep an eye on you this night. There are  hobgoblins in the air. Why are you not at home in the bosom of your  family yourself?\"    \"The walking is too bad,\" said Grantham. \"And, besides, that confounded  valet of mine forgot to put my snowshoes in my suit-case.\"    \"They say the river is frozen solid all the way up,\" put in Billie  Ricketts, who is a good deal of a wag, as all old bachelors are apt to  be. \"Why don't you fellows skate home?\"    \"I tried it,\" smiled Grantham, \"but the wind is blowing down the river,  and I live up. I hadn't been going more than two hours when I landed on  Staten Island.\"    In this way the exiles strove to comfort each other, and on the surface  succeeded, but inwardly a very miserable lot they were. Clubs have their  attractions, but we have not yet succeeded in developing an institution  of that kind which is a fair substitute for the home fireside on a  Christmas Eve. Even the most confirmed old bachelor will confess to you  that, way down deep in his heart, the comforts of such organizations  seem cheerless and cold in contrast to the visions of smiling  hearthstones and merry gatherings of happy children, that come to them  in their dreams.    \"You've got some bundle there, Dobby,\" said Grantham, as Dobbleigh  relieved himself of his burden of packages. \"What are you going to do,  open a department store?\"    \"Huh!\" ejaculated Ricketts. \"You're a fine fellow to talk.

During this task,  his attention had been particularly directed to the interpretation of  the monuments and Etruscan inscriptions contained in the ducal gallery,  which, together with the ancient Tuscan, the Umbrian, and other obsolete  dialects, soon grew familiar to him, and led to the composition of his  celebrated _Essay upon the Tuscan Tongue_. For the purpose of more  complete research and illustration, he obtained permission from the duke  to visit Rome, in order to consult the museums, and prepare the way for  his essay, which he published there in 1789; a work of immense erudition  and research.    It was here Lanzi first appeared as the most profound antiquarian of  modern Italy, by his successful explanation of some ancient Etruscan  inscriptions and remains of art, which had baffled the skill of a number  of his most distinguished countrymen. Upon presenting it to the grand  duke, after his return from Rome, Lanzi was immediately appointed his  head antiquary and director of the Florentine gallery; while the city of  Gubbio raised him to the rank of their first patrician order, on account  of his successful elucidation of the famous Eugubine Tables. In one of  his _Dissertations upon a small Tuscan Urn_, he triumphantly refuted  some charges which had been invidiously advanced against him, and  defended his principles of antiquarian illustration by retorting the  charge of fallacy upon his adversaries.    In the year 1790, Lanzi, at the request of the Gonfaloniere and priors  of Monte dell'Olino, published an inquiry into the _Condition and Site  of Pausula, an ancient City of Piceno_; said to be written with  surprising ingenuity, yet with equal fairness; uninfluenced by any  prejudices arising from national partiality, or from the nature of the  commission with which he had been honoured. This was speedily followed  by a much more important undertaking, connected with the prosecution of  his great design, which it would appear he had already for some time  entertained.    During the period of his travels through Italy in pursuit of  antiquities, he had carefully collected materials for a general History  of Painting, which was meant to comprize, in a compendious form,  whatever should be found scattered throughout the numerous authors who  had written upon the art. These materials, as well as the work itself,  had gradually grown upon his hands, as might be expected from a man so  long accustomed to method, to criticism, to perspicuity; in short, to  every quality requisite in the philosophical treatment of a great  subject. The artists and literati of Italy, then, were not a little  surprised at the appearance of the first portion of the _Storia  Pittorica_, comprehending _Lower Italy; or the Florentine, Sienese,  Roman, and Neapolitan Schools, reduced to a compendious and methodical  form_, _adapted to facilitate a knowledge of Professors and of their  Styles, for the lovers of the art_. It was dedicated to the grand  duchess Louisa Maria of Bourbon, in a style, observes the Cav. Bossi,  \"which recalls to mind the letters of Pliny to Trajan, composed with  mingled dignity and respect; with genuine feeling, and with true, not  imaginary, commendations.\" _Elogio_, p. 127.    But the unfeigned pleasure and admiration expressed in the world of  literature and art, on being presented with the Pictorial History of  Lower Italy, was almost equalled by its disappointment at the delay  experienced with regard to the appearance of the second part; and which  it was feared would never see the light. Lanzi's state of health had,  some time subsequent to 1790, been very precarious; and he suffered  severely from a distressing complaint,[25] which frequently interrupted  his travels in which he was then engaged, collecting further materials  for his History of Painting in Upper Italy. While thus employed, on his  return from Genoa in December, 1793, he experienced a first attack of  apoplexy, as he was passing the mountains of Massa and Carrara. After  his recovery, and return to Florence, he was advised in the ensuing  spring to visit the baths of Albano, which being situated near Bassano,  afforded him an opportunity of superintending the publication of his  history, in the Remondini Press, and on a more extensive scale than he  had at first contemplated. He likewise obtained permission from the  grand duke Leopold to absent himself, during some time, from his charge  at Florence, in September, 1793. The first portion of his labours he  conceived to be too scanty in point of names and notices to satisfy  public taste, so that upon completing the latter part upon a more full  and extensive scale, he gave a new edition of that already published,  very considerably altered and augmented.    To these improvements he invariably contributed, both in notes and text,  at every subsequent edition, a number of which appeared in the course of  a few years, until the work attained a degree of completeness and  correctness seldom bestowed upon labours of such incredible difficulty  and extent. The last which received the correction and additions of the  author was published at Bassano, in the year 1809.    That a work upon such a scale was a great desideratum, no less to Italy  than to the general world of art, would appear evident from the  character of the various histories and accounts of painting which had  preceded it. They are rather valuable as records, than as real criticism  or history; as annals of particular characters and productions derived  from contemporary observation, than as sound and enlightened views, and  a dispassionate estimate of individual merits. Full of errors, idle  prejudices, and discussions foreign to the subject, a large portion of  their pages is taken up in vapid conceits, personal accusations, and  puerile reasoning, destitute of method.    The work of Lanzi, on the other hand, as it is well remarked by the Cav.  Boni, observes throughout the precept of the _serie et junctura_ of  Horace. It brings into full light the leading professors of the art,  exhibits at due distance those of the second class, and only glances at  mediocrity and inferiority of character, insomuch as to fill up the  great pictoric canvas with its just lights and shades. The true causes  of the decline and revival of the art at certain epochs are pointed out,  with those that contribute to preserve the fine arts in their happiest  lustre; in which, recourse to examples more than to precepts is strongly  recommended. The best rules are unfolded for facilitating the study of  different manners, some of which are known to bear a resemblance, though  by different hands, and others are opposed to each other, although  adopted by the same artist; a species of knowledge highly useful at a  period when the best productions are eagerly sought after at a high  rate. It is a history, in short, worthy of being placed at the side of  that on the Literature of Italy by Tiraboschi, who having touched upon  the fine arts at the outset of his labours, often urged his ancient  friend and colleague to dilate upon a subject in every way so flattering  to the genius of Italy; to Italy which, however rivalled by other  nations in science and in literature, stands triumphant and alone in its  creative mind of art.    It is, however, difficult to convey a just idea of a work composed upon  so enlarged and complete a scale; which embraces a period of about six  centuries, and fourteen Italian schools, but treated with such rapidity  and precision, as to form in itself a compendium of whatever we meet  with in so many volumes of guides, catalogues, descriptions of churches  and palaces, and in so many lives of artists throughout the whole of  Italy. (pp. 130-1.)    It is known that Richardson expressed a wish that some historian would  collect these scattered accounts relating to the art of painting, at the  same time noting down its progress and decline in every age, a  desideratum which Mengs in part supplied in one of his letters, briefly  marking down all the respective eras. Upon this plan, as far as regarded  Venetian painting, Zanetti had partially proceeded; but the general  survey, in its perfect form, of the whole of the other schools, was  destined to be completed by the genius of Lanzi. Here he first gives the  general character of each, distinguishing its particular epochs,  according to the alterations in taste which it underwent. A few artists  of distinguished reputation, whose influence gave a new impulse and new  laws to the art, stand at the head of each era, which they may be said  to have produced, with a full description of their style. To these great  masters, their respective pupils are annexed, with the progress of their  school, referring to such as may have more or less added to, or altered  the manner of their prototype. For the sake of greater perspicuity, the  painters of history are kept distinct from the artists in inferior  branches; among whom are classed portrait and landscape painters, those  of animals, of flowers, of fruits, &c. Nor are such as bear an affinity  to the art, like engraving, inlaying, mosaic work, and embroidery,  wholly excluded. Being doubtful whether he should make mention of those  artists who belong neither to the senatorial, the equestrian, nor the  popular order of the pictorial republic, and have no public  representation, such as the names of mediocrity; Lanzi finally decided  to introduce them among their superiors, like third-rate actors, whose  figures may just be seen, in order to preserve the entireness of the  story. To this he was farther induced by the general appearance of their  names in the various dictionaries, guides, and"]]]
