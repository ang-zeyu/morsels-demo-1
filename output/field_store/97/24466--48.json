Though we knew that the blacks  do get water from the mallee roots, and though we were in a spot where it  was clear they had done so perhaps a month before, yet our attempts at  water-finding were futile. This kopi is peculiar soil to walk over; on the  surface there is a hard crust--once through this, one sinks nearly to the  knee; the camels of course, from their weight, go much lower.    On the night of the 23rd, we gave Tommy two gallons of water--not much of  a drink, but enough to make him tackle the mulga, and spinifex-tops, the  only available feed; none but West Australian brumbies could live on such  fare, and they will eat anything, like donkeys or goats. On the 24th there  was no change, a few quondongs affording a meal for the camels.    The next day we crossed more old native tracks and followed them for some  time without any sign of water being near. More tracks the following day,  fresher this time; but though doubtless there was water at the end of  them, for several reasons we did not follow them far: first, they were  leading south-west and we wished to go north; second, the quantity of  mallee root heaps, suggested the possibility that the natives could obtain  from them sufficient moisture to live upon. I think now that this is most  unlikely, and that roots are only resorted to when travelling or in time  of great need. However, at that time we were inclined to think it  probable, and though we might have sucked roots in place of a drink of tea  or water, such a source of supply was absolutely valueless to the camels  and pony.    On the 27th we sighted a hill dead ahead, which I named Mount Luck, and on  the southern side a nice little plain of saltbush and grass--a pleasant  and welcome change. Mount Luck is sheer on its south and east sides and  slopes gradually to the north-west; it is of desert sandstone, and from  its summit, nearly due east, can be seen an imposing flat-topped hill,  which I named Mount Douglas, after my old friend and companion, to the  north of this hill two quaint little pinnacles stand up above the scrub to  a considerable height.    Poor Tommy was now getting very weak and had to be dragged by the last  camel. I had not ridden him since the second day from the Spring; he was  famished and worn to a skeleton. His allowance of two gallons a night had  continued, which made a considerable hole in our supply, further  diminished by the necessity of giving him damper to eat. Poor little pony!  It was a cruel sight to see him wandering from pack to pack in camp,  poking his nose into every possible opening, and even butting us with his  head as if to call attention to his dreadful state, which was only too  apparent. \"While there's life there's hope,\" and every day took us nearer  to water--that is if we were to get any at all! So long as we could do so,  we must take Tommy with us, who might yet be saved. This, however, was not  to be, for on the 28th we again encountered sand-ridges, running at right  angles to our course, and these proved too hard for the poor brave  brumby. About midday he at last gave in, and with glazed eyes and stiff  limbs he fell to the ground. Taking off the saddle he carried, I knelt by  his head for a few minutes and could see there was no hope. Poor, faithful  friend! I felt like a murderer in doing it, but I knew it was the kindest  thing--and finished his sufferings with a bullet. There on the ridge, his  bones will lie for many a long day. Brave Tommy, whose rough and unkempt  exterior covered a heart that any warhorse might have envied, had covered  135 miles, without feed worth mentioning, and with only eleven gallons of  water during that distance, a stage of nearly seven days' duration of very  hard travelling indeed, with the weather pretty sultry, though the nights  were cool. His death, however, was in favour of our water supply, which  was not too abundant. So much had been lost by the bags knocking about on  the saddle, by their own pressure against the side of the saddle, and by  evaporation, that we had to content ourselves with a quart-potful between  us morning and evening--by no means a handsome allowance.    On the 29th, after travelling eight hours through scrubs, we were just  about to camp when the shrill \"coo-oo\" of a black-fellow met our ears; and  on looking round we were startled to see some half-dozen natives gazing at  us. Jenny chose at that moment to give forth the howl that only cow-camels  can produce; this was too great a shock for the blacks, who stampeded  pell-mell, leaving their spears and throwing-sticks behind them. We gave  chase, and, after a spirited run, Luck managed to stop a man. A  stark-naked savage this, and devoid of all adornment excepting a  waist-belt of plaited grass and a \"sporran\" of similar material. He was in  great dread of the camels and not too sure of us. I gave him something to  eat, and, by eating some of it myself, put him more at ease. After various  futile attempts at conversation, in which Luck displayed great knowledge  of the black's tongue, as spoken a few hundred miles away near Eucla, but  which unfortunately was quite lost on this native, we at last succeeded in  making our wants understood. \"Ingup,\" \"Ingup,\" he kept repeating, pointing  with his chin to the North and again to the West. Evidently \"Ingup\" stood  for water; for he presently took us to a small granite rock and pointed  out a soak or rock-hole, we could not say which. Whilst we stooped to  examine the water-hole, our guide escaped into the scrub and was soon lost  to view. Near the rock we found his camp. A few branches leaning against a  bush formed his house. In front a fire was burning, and near it a plucked  bird lay ready for cooking. Darkness overtook us before we could get to  work on the rock-hole, so we turned into the blankets with a more  satisfied feeling than we had done for some days past. During the night  the blacks came round us. The camels, very tired, had lain down close by,  and, quietly creeping to Jenny, I slapped her nose, which awoke her with  the desired result, viz., a loud roar. The sound of rapidly retreating  feet was heard, and their owners troubled us no more.    So sure were we of the supply in the granite that we gave the camels the  few gallons that were left in our bags, and were much disgusted to find  the next day that, far from being a soakage, the water was merely  contained in a rock-hole, which had been filled in with sand and sticks.    April 30th and May 1st were occupied in digging out the sand and  collecting what water we could, a matter of five or six gallons. So bad  was this water that the camels would not touch it; however, it made  excellent bread, and passable tea. Man, recognising Necessity, is less  fastidious than animals who look to their masters to supply them with the  best, and cannot realise that in such cases \"Whatever is, is best.\"    From a broken granite rock North-West of the rock-hole, we sighted  numerous peaks to the North, and knew that Mount Shenton could not now be  far away. To the East of the rock-hole is a very prominent bluff some  fifteen miles distant; this I named Mount Fleming, after Colonel Fleming,  then Commandant of the West Australian forces.    May 2nd we reached the hills and rejoiced to find ourselves once more in  decent country. Numerous small, dry watercourses ran down from the hills,  fringed with grass and bushes. In the open mulga, kangaroos' tracks were  numerous, and in the hills we saw several small red kangaroos, dingoes,  and emus. At first we found great difficulty in identifying any of the  hills; but after much consultation and reference to the map we at last  picked out Mount Shenton, and on reaching the hill knew that we were  right, for we found Wells' cairn of stones and the marks of his camp and  camels. The next difficulty was in finding the soakage, as from a bad  reproduction of Wells' map it was impossible to determine whether the soak  was at the foot of Mount Shenton or near another hill three miles away.  It only remained to search both localities. Our trouble was rewarded by  the finding of an excellent little soakage, near the foot of a granite  rock, visible due East, from the top of Mount Shenton, some two miles  distant. Here we had an abundant supply, and not before it was wanted. The  camels had had no water with the exception of a mouthful apiece from the  night of April 21st until the night of May 3rd, a period of twelve days,  during which we had travelled nearly two hundred miles over very trying  ground. The cool nights were greatly in their favour, and yet it was a  good performance, more especially that at the end of it they were in  pretty fair fettle.    What a joy that water was to us! what a luxury a wash was! and clean  clothes! Really it's worth while being half famished and wholly filthy for  a few days, that one may so thoroughly enjoy such delights afterwards!  I know few feelings of satisfaction that approach those which one  experiences on such occasions. Our cup of joy was not yet full, for as we  sat mending our torn clothes, two over-inquisitive emus approached.  Luckily a Winchester was close to hand, and as they were starting to run I  managed to bowl one over. Wounded in the thigh he could yet go a great  pace, but before long we caught up with him and despatched him with a blow  on the head. What a feed we had! I suppose there is hardly a part of that  bird, barring bones, feathers, and beak that did not find its way into our  mouths during the next day or two! Tinned meat is good, sometimes  excellent; but when you find that a cunning storekeeper has palmed off all  his minced mutton on you, you are apt to fancy tinned fare monotonous!  Such was our case; and no matter what the label, the contents were always  the same--though we tried to differentiate in imagination, as we used to  call it venison, beef, veal, or salmon, for variety's sake!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4985"],[0,"Ruth Fielding of the Red Mill; Or, Jasper Parloe's Secret (#8)"],[1," week were  necessarily trying. On Saturday, however, came a clear day. The sun  shone, the drenched trees shook themselves, and the wind came and blew  softly and warmly through their branches to dry the tender foliage.  The birds popped out of their hiding-places and began to sing and  chirp as though they never could be glad enough for this change in the  weather.    There was so much to see from the kitchen door at the Red Mill that  Ruth did not mind her work that morning. She had learned now to help  Aunt Alvirah in many ways. Not often did the old lady have to go about  moaning her old refrain:    \"Oh, my back and oh, my bones! Oh, my back and oh, my bones!\"    The housework was all done and the kitchen swept and as neat as a new  pin when the gay tooting of the Cameron automobile horn called Ruth to  the porch. There was only Helen on the front seat of the car; but in  the tonneau was a bundled-up figure surmounted by what looked to be a  scarlet cap which Ruth knew instantly must be Tom's. Ruth did not know  many boys and, never having had a brother, was not a little bashful.  Besides, she was afraid Tom Cameron would make much of her connection  with his being found on the Wilkins Corners road that dark night,  after his accident.    And there was another thing that made Ruth feel diffident about  approaching the boy. She had borne it all the time in her mind, and  the instant she saw Tom in the automobile it bobbed up to the surface  of her thought again.    \"It was Jabe Potter--he did it.\"    So, for more reasons than one, Ruth approached the motor car with  hesitation.    \"Oh, Ruth!\" cried Helen, putting out a gauntleted hand to her. \"So  this horrid rain has not washed you away? You won't like the Red Mill  if the weather keeps this way. And how do you get on?\" she added,  lowering her voice. \"How about the Ogre?\"    \"He has not ground me into bread-flour yet,\" responded Ruth, smiling.    \"I see he hasn't. You're just as plump as ever, so he hasn't starved  you, either. Now, Ruth, I want you to know my brother Tom, whom you  have met before without his having been aware of it at the time,\" and  she laughed again.    Tom's left arm was in a sling, and the scarlet bandage around his head  made him look like a pirate; but he grinned broadly at Ruth and put  out his lean brown hand.    \"When I heard about you, Miss Fielding, I knew you were a spunky one,\"  he said. \"And anybody that Reno takes to, the way she did to you, is  all right. Besides, Nell is just spoons on you already, and Nell, like  Reno, doesn't take to every girl.\"    \"The doctor said an outing in the car wouldn't hurt Tom,\" went on  Helen, \"and we're going to run up the valley road a way. Now Ruth  Fielding, you get your hat and coat and come with us.\"    \"I don't know that I may,\" Ruth said, timidly.    \"I'll believe that he is an ogre then, and that you are kept a  prisoner in this awful castle,\" cried Helen.    \"I'd love to go,\" murmured Ruth.    \"Then run and ask,\" urged her friend, while Tom added, good-naturedly:    \"Yes, why not come along? Don't be afraid of Nell's driving. She  handles the car all right.\"    Ruth knew that Uncle Jabez had gone to town. She had a feeling that he  did not like the Camerons and might oppose her friendliness with them.  But he was not at hand now to interfere with her innocent pleasures.  She went in and asked Aunt Alvirah if she could take the ride.    \"Why not, child? You've been the very best helpmate ever an old woman  had--Oh, my back and oh, my bones! Run along and have your fun,  deary. You need not be back till supper time. You have earned your  little outing, that's sure and sartain.\"    Before Helen had picked her up on the road to the Red Mill that first  day, Ruth had never ridden in a motor car. On that occasion they had  traveled very slowly, while the girls talked. But now, when she was  seated beside her new friend, Helen ran the auto on its high gear, and  they shot away up the level river road at a pace that almost took  Ruth's breath away.    \"Up here among the foothills is the big Minturn Pond Dam,\" Tom said,  leaning forward to speak to their guest. \"It's twenty miles above your  uncle's dam and is a deal bigger. And some say it is not safe--Wait,  Nell! Slow down so that we can see the face of the dam from the  Overlook.\"    The speed of the car was immediately reduced under Helen's  manipulation, and then she swerved it into a short side road running  toward the river, and they came out upon a little graveled plaza in  the center of a tiny park, which gave a splendid view of the valley in  both directions.    But the young people in the motor car turned their eyes to the west.  There the face of the Minturn dam could be discerned; and even as they  looked at it they seemed to see it changing--dissolving, covered with  mist, and spouting geysers of what at first seemed like smoke. But it  was Tom who realized the truth.    \"She's burst!\" he cried. \"The old dam's burst! There she goes in a  dozen places!\"    Although they were several miles down the valley, the thunder of the  bursting masonry now echoed in their ears. And up from the bottom of  the wall, near its center, a great geyser spouted. In a moment the  wall crumbled and they saw tons upon tons of the masonry melt away.  The waters of the pond burst through in a solid flood and charged down  the valley, spreading wider and wider as it charged on, and bearing  upon its crest every light and unstable structure found in its path.    It was a startling--a terrifying sight. No wonder the two girls cried  out in alarm and clung together. The sight of the charging flood  fascinated them.    But then they were aroused--and that within the first half minute of  their terror--by Tom. He was trying, crippled as he was, to climb  over into their seat.    \"What are you doing, you foolish boy?\" cried Helen. \"Sit down.\"    \"We've got to get out of here!\" muttered the excited youth.    \"Why, we are safe here. The water will never rise to this height.\"    \"I know it! I know it!\" groaned Tom, falling back in his seat and  paling because of the pain from his arm, which he had twisted. \"But  don't you see? There are many down the valley who won't know of this  until too late. Why, they can't see it at the bridge--at Culm Falls--  until the flood is right upon them.\"    \"It's true!\" gasped Helen. \"What shall we do?\"    \"We must warn them--we can warn them, can't we?\" demanded Ruth. \"This  car runs so fast--you control it so well, Helen. Can't we warn them?\"    \"Try it, Sis!\" shouted Tom. \"You can do it!\"    And already his sister, setting her teeth hard upon her lower lip, was  backing and turning the motor car. In twenty seconds they were dashing  off upon the track over which they had so recently come--on the road  down the valley with the flood following fast behind them.      CHAPTER X     THE RACE    The two girls on the front seat of the flying automobile were not  prepared for racing. Of course, Ruth Fielding had no proper automobile  outfit, and Helen had not expected such an emergency when she had  started with her crippled brother for this afternoon run. She had no  goggles, nor any mask; but she had the presence of mind to raise the  wind-shield.    Already they could have heard the steady roaring of the advancing  flood had not the racing motor car drowned all other sounds. There  was, however, no need to look behind; they knew the wave was there and  that it was sweeping down the valley of the Lumano with frightful  velocity.    Indeed, they were not at all sure for those first few miles whether  they were traveling as fast as the flood, or not. Suppose the wave  should reach and sweep away the bridge before they could cross the  river? The thought was in the mind of both Helen and Ruth, whether  Tom, on the rear seat, considered it or not. When they finally shot  out of the woods and turned toward the toll-bridge, all glanced  around. From here the upper reaches of the Lumano were plainly  revealed. And extending clear across the valley was the foam-crested  wave charging down upon the lowlands, but a number of miles away.    Here was the first house, too. They saw a man and woman and several  children out front, staring at the automobile as it raced down the  road. Perhaps they had been called from the house by the vibration of  the bursting dam.    Tom sprang up in the car and pointed behind him, yelling:    \"The flood! The flood!\"    It is doubtful if they heard what he said; and they, too, were on a  knoll and likely out of the reach of the water. But the three in the  automobile saw the whole family turn and run for the higher ground  behind their house. They understood the peril which menaced the whole  valley.    In a flash the auto had turned the bend in the river road, and the  occupants saw the toll-bridge and the peaceful hamlet of Culm Falls.  There was no stir there. The toll-bridge keeper was not even out of  his cottage, and the light and flimsy gates were down across the  driveway at either end of the bridge. The bend in the river hid the  advancing wall of water. Perhaps, too, it deadened the sound of the  bursting dam and the roar of the waters.    There was another house at the bend. Helen tooted the automobile horn  as though it had gone crazy. The raucous notes must of a certainty  have awakened anybody but the Seven Sleepers. But the three in the car  saw no sign of life about the premises. Helen had started to slow  down; but Tom stopped her with a hand on her arm.    \"Not here! Not here!\" he yelled. \"Get across the river first, Nell!  That wave is coming!\"    Indeed it was. And the toll-bridge keeper did not appear, and the  gates were shut. But Helen Cameron was excited now and her racing  blood was up. She never hesitated at the frail barrier, but drove  straight through it, smashing the gate to kindling wood, and smashing  their own wind shield as well.    Out ran the toll-man then; but they"]]]
