The internal organs, however, are much  more complex and complete. The tracheae have made their appearance, and  the mouth is provided with a pair of mandibles. From this point the  metamorphoses of _Platygaster_ do not appear to differ materially from  those of other parasitic Hymenoptera.    An allied genus, _Polynema_, has also very curious larvae. The perfect  insect is aquatic in its habits, swimming by means of its wings; flying,  if we may say so, under water.[15] It lays its eggs inside those of  Dragon-flies; and the embryo, as shown in Fig. 28, has the form of a  bottle-shaped mass of undifferentiated embryonal cells, covered by a  thin cuticle, but without any trace of further organization. Protected  by the egg-shell of the Dragon-fly, and bathed in the nourishing fluid  of the Dragon-fly's egg, the young _Polynema_ imbibes nourishment through  its whole surface, and increases rapidly in size. The digestive canal  gradually makes its appearance; the cellular mass forms a new skin  beneath the original cuticle, distinctly divided into segments, and  provided with certain appendages. After a while the old cuticle is  thrown off, and the larva gradually assumes the form shown in Fig. 29.  The subsequent metamorphoses of _Polynema_ offer no special peculiarities.    [Illustration: FIG. 28, Embryo of _Polynema_ (after Ganin). 29, Larva of  _Polynema_--_asch_, rudiments of the antenna; _flsch_, rudiments of the  wings; _bsch_, rudiments of the legs; _vfg_. lateral projections;  _gsch_, rudiments of the ovipositor; _fk_, fatty tissue.]    From these facts--and, if necessary, many more of the same nature might  have been brought forward--it seems to me evident that while the form of  any given larva depends to a certain extent on the group of insects to  which it belongs, it is also greatly influenced by the external  conditions to which it is subjected; that it is a function of the life  which the larva leads and of the group to which it belongs.    The larvae of insects are generally regarded as being nothing more than  immature states--as stages in the development of the egg into the  imago; and this might more especially appear to be the case with those  insects in which the larvae offer a general resemblance in form and  structure (excepting of course so far as relates to the wings) to the  perfect insect. Nevertheless we see that this would be a very incomplete  view of the case. The larva and pupa undergo changes which have no  relation to the form which the insect will ultimately assume. With a  general tendency to this goal, as regards size and the development of  the wings, there are coincident other changes having reference only to  existing wants and condition. Nor is there in this, I think, anything  which need surprise us. External circumstances act on the insect in its  preparatory states, as well as in its perfect condition. Those who  believe that animals are susceptible of great, though gradual, change  through the influence of external conditions, whether acting, as Mr.  Darwin has suggested, through natural selection, or in any other manner,  will see no reason why these changes should be confined to the mature  animal. And it is evident that creatures which, like the majority of  insects, live during the successive periods of their existence in very  different circumstances, may undergo considerable changes in their  larval organization, in consequence of forces acting on them while in  that condition; not, indeed, without affecting, but certainly without  affecting to any corresponding extent, their ultimate form.    I conclude, therefore, that the form of the larva in insects, whenever  it departs from the hexapod _Campodea_ type, has been modified by the  conditions under which it lives. The external forces acting upon it are  different from those which affect the mature form; and thus changes are  produced in the young which have reference to its immediate wants,  rather than to its final form.    And, lastly, as a consequence, that metamorphoses may be divided into  two kinds, developmental and adaptional or adaptive.          CHAPTER III.    _ON THE NATURE OF METAMORPHOSES._      In the preceding chapters we have considered the life history of insects  after they have quitted the egg; but it is obvious that to treat the  subject in a satisfactory manner we must take the development as a  whole, from the commencement of the changes in the egg, up to the  maturity of the animal, and not suffer ourselves to be confused by the  fact that insects leave the egg in very different stages of embryonal  development. For though all young insects when they quit the egg are  termed \"larvae,\" whatever their form may be (the case of the so-called  Pupipara not constituting a true exception), still it must be remembered  that some of these larvae are much more advanced than others. It is  evident that the larva of a fly, as regards its stage of development,  corresponds in reality neither with that of a moth nor with that of a  grasshopper. The maggots of flies, in which the appendages of the head  are rudimentary, belong to a lower grade than the grubs of bees, &c.,  which have antennae, mandibles, maxillae, labrum, labium, and, in fact,  all the mouth parts of a perfect insect.    The caterpillars of Lepidoptera are generally classed with the vermiform  larva of Diptera and Hymenoptera, and contrasted with those of  Orthoptera, Hemiptera, &c.; but, in truth, the possession of thoracic  legs places them, together with the similar larvae of the Tenthredinidae,  on a decidedly higher level. Thus, then, the period of growth (that in  which the animal eats and increases in size) occupies sometimes one  stage in the development of an insect, sometimes another; sometimes, as  for instance in the case of _Chloeon_, it continues through more than  one; or, in other words, growth is accompanied by development. But, in  fact, the question is even more complicated than this. It is not only  that the larvae of insects at their birth offer the most various grades  of development, from the grub of a fly to the young of a grasshopper or  a cricket; but that, if we were to classify larvae according to their  development, we should have to deal, not with a simple case of  gradations only, but with a series of gradations, which would be  different according to the organ which we took as our test.    Apart, however, from the adaptive changes to which special reference was  made in the previous chapter, the differences which larvae present are  those of gradation, not of direction. The development of a grasshopper  does not pursue a different course from that of a butterfly, but the  embryo attains a higher state before quitting the egg in the former than  in the latter: while in most Hymenoptera, as for instance in Bees,  Wasps, Ants, &c., the young are hatched without thoracic appendages; in  the Orthoptera, on the contrary, the legs are fully developed before the  young animal quits the egg.    Prof. Owen,[16] indeed, goes so far as to say that the Orthoptera and  other Homomorphous insects are, \"at one stage of their development,  apodal and acephalous larvae, like the maggot of the fly; but instead of  quitting the egg in this stage, they are quickly transformed into  another, in which the head and rudimental thoracic feet are developed to  the degree which characterizes the hexapod larvae of the _Carabi_ and  _Petalocera_.\"    [Illustration: FIG. 30, Egg of _Phryganea_ (Mystacides)--_A_^1,  mandibular segment; _C_^1 to _C_^5, maxillary, labial, and three  thoracic segments; _D_, abdomen (after Zaddach). 31, Egg of _Phryganea_  somewhat more advanced--_b_, mandibles; _c_, maxillae; _cfs_, rudiments  of the three pairs of legs.]    I quite believe that this may have been true of such larvae at an early  geological period, but the fact now appears to be, so far at least as  can be judged from the observations yet recorded, that the legs of those  larvae which leave the egg with these appendages generally make their  appearance before the body-walls have closed, or the internal organs  have approached to completion. Indeed, when the legs first appear, they  are merely short projections, which it is not always easy to distinguish  from the segments themselves. It must, however, be admitted, that the  observations are neither so numerous, nor in most cases so full, as  could be wished.    Fig. 30 represents an egg of a May-fly (_Phryganea_), as represented by  Zaddach in his excellent memoir,[17] just before the appearance of the  appendages. It will be seen that a great part of the yolk is still  undifferentiated, that the side walls are incomplete, the back quite  open, and the segments merely indicated by undulations. This stage is  rapidly passed through, and Zaddach only once met with an egg in this  condition; in every other specimen which had indications of segments,  the rudiments of the legs had also made their appearance, as in Fig. 31,  which, however, as will be seen, does not in other respects show much  advance on Fig. 30.    Again in _Aphis_, the embryology of which has been so well worked out by  Huxley,[18] the case is very similar, although the legs are somewhat  later in making their appearance. When the young was 1/140th of an inch  in length, he found the cephalic portion of the embryo beginning, he  says, \"to extend upwards again over the anterior face of the germ, so as  to constitute its anterior and a small part of its superior"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38233"],[0,"Birds Every Child Should Know (#8)"],[1,"in  the orchard, the bushes in the roadside thicket, the willows and  alders beside the stream. He is shorter than the English sparrow by an  inch. Although you may not get close enough to see that his yellow  breast is finely streaked with reddish brown, you may know by these  marks that he is not what you at first suspected he was--somebody's  pet canary escaped from a cage. It is not he but the goldfinch--the  yellow bird with the black wings--who sings like a canary. Happily he  is so neighbourly that every child may easily become acquainted with  this most common member of the large warbler family.    {54}    I don't believe there is anybody living who could name at sight every  one of the seventy warblers that visit the United States. Some are  very gaily coloured and exquisitely marked, as birds coming to us from  the tropics have a right to be. Some are quietly clad; some, like the  redstart, are dressed quite differently from their mates and young;  others, like the yellow warbler, are so nearly alike that you could  see no difference between the male and female from the distance of a  few feet. Some live in the tops of evergreens and other tall trees;  others, like the Maryland yellow-throat, which seems to prefer low  trees and shrubbery, are rarely seen over twelve feet from the ground.  A few, like the oven-bird, haunt the undergrowth in the woods or live  most of the time on the earth. With three or four exceptions all the  warblers dwell in woodlands, and it is only during the spring and  autumn migrations that we have an opportunity to become acquainted  with them; when they come about the orchard and shrubbery for a few  days' rest and refreshment during their travels. Fortunately the  cheerful little yellow warbler stays around our homes all summer long.  Did you ever know a family so puzzling and contradictory as the  Warblers?    The great majority of these fascinating and exasperating relatives are  nervous, restless little sprites, constantly flitting from branch to  {55} branch and from twig to twig in a never-ending search for small  insects. As well try to catch a weasel asleep as a warbler at rest.  People who live in the tropics, even for a little while, soon become  lazy. Not so the warblers, whose energy, like a steam engine's, seems  to be increased by heat. Of course they do not undertake long journeys  merely for pleasure, as wealthy human tourists do. They must migrate  to find food; and as insects are most plentiful in warm weather, you  see why these atoms of animation keep in perpetual motion. They are  among the last migrants to come north in the spring and among the  first to leave in the autumn because insects don't hatch out in cool  weather, and the birds must always be sure of plenty to eat.  Travelling as they do, chiefly by night, they are killed in numbers  against the lighthouses and electric light towers which especially  fascinate these poor little victims.    Who first misled us by calling these birds warblers? The truth is  there is not one really fine singer, like a thrush, in the whole  family. The yellow-breasted chat has remarkable vocal ability, but he  is not a real musician like the mockingbird, who also likes to have  fun with his voice. The warblers, as a rule, have weak, squeaky, or  wiry songs and lisping _tseep_ call notes, neither of which ought to  be called a warble. The yellow warbler sings as acceptably {56} as  most of his kin. Seven times he rapidly repeats  _\"Sweet--sweet--sweet--sweet--sweet--sweeter--sweeter\"_ to his  sweetheart, but this happy little lovemaker's incessant song is apt to  become almost tiresome to everybody except his mate.    What a clever little creature she is! More than any other bird she  suffers from the persecutions of that dusky rascal, the cowbird. In  May, with much help from her mate, she builds an exquisite little  cradle of silvery plant fibre, usually shreds of milkweed stalk,  grass, leaves, and caterpillars' silk, neatly lined with hair,  feathers, and the downy felt of fern fronds. The cradle is sometimes  placed in the crotch of an elder bush, sometimes in a willow tree;  preferably near water where insects are abundant, but often in a  terminal branch of some orchard tree.    Scarcely is it finished before the skulking cowbird watches her chance  to lay an egg in it that she may not be bothered with the care of her  own baby. She knows that the yellow warbler is a gentle, amiable,  devoted mother, who will probably work herself to death, if necessary,  rather than let the big baby cowbird starve. But she sometimes makes a  great mistake in her individual. Not all yellow warblers will permit  the outrage. They prefer to weave a new bottom to their nest, over the  {57} cowbird's egg, although they may seal up their own speckled  treasures with it. Suppose the wicked cowbird comes back and lays  still another egg in the two-storied nest: what then? The little  Spartan yellow bird has been known to weave still another layer of  covering rather than hatch out an unwelcome, greedy interloper to  crowd and starve her own precious babies. Two and even three-storied  nests are to be found by bright-eyed boys and girls.      BLACK AND WHITE CREEPING WARBLER    You may possibly mistake this little warbler for a downy woodpecker  when first you see him creeping rapidly over the bark of trees, or  hanging from the under side of the branches. But when he flits  restlessly from twig to twig and from tree to tree without taking time  to examine spots thoroughly; especially when he calls a few thin wiry  notes--_zee-zee-zee-zee_--you may know he is no woodpecker, but a  warbler. Woodpeckers have thick set, high shouldered bodies which they  flatten against the tree trunks; the males wear red in their caps, and  all have larger, stouter bills than the warbler's. Moreover, no  woodpecker is so small as this streaked and speckled little creature  who is usually too intent {58} on feeding to utter a single _zee_. You  could not possibly confuse him with the diligent, placid brown creeper  or with the slate-blue nuthatch which also creeps along the branches  on the under or upper side. Some children I know call this black and  white warbler the little zebra bird. Would that all warblers were so  easily identified!      OVEN-BIRD    _Called also: The Teacher; Golden-crowned Thrush; The Accentor._    \"Teacher--_Teacher_--TEACHER--TEACHER--_TEACHER!_\" resounds a  penetrating, accented voice from the woods. Who calls? Not an  impatient scholar, as you might suppose, but a shy little thrush-like  warbler who has no use whatever for any human being, especially at the  nesting season in May and June, when he calls most loudly and  frequently. Beginning quite softly, he gradually increases the  intensity of each pair of notes in a crescendo that seems to come from  a point much nearer than it really does. Once heard it is never  forgotten, and you can always be sure of naming at least one bird by  his voice alone. However, his really exquisite love song--a clear,  ringing, vivacious melody, uttered while the singer is fluttering,  hovering, high among the tree-tops--is rarely heard, or if heard is  not recognised as the teacher's aerial serenade. He is a warbler, let  it be recorded, who really can sing, and beautifully, however rarely.      [Illustration]    The ovenbird who calls  \"Teacher, _Teacher_, TEACHER, TEACHER, _TEACHER!_\"    [Illustration]    Ovenbird in her cleverly hidden nest. Some of the leaves and sticks  have been pulled away from the front to secure her picture.      [Illustration]    Young ovenbirds on day of leaving nest.      {59}    Why is he called the oven-bird? A little girl I know was offered five  dollars by her father if she could find the bird's nest in the high  dry woods near her home. ''Teacher!'' was the commonest sound that  came from them. It rang in her ears all day, so of course she thought  it would be \"too easy\" to earn the money. Every afternoon, when school  was out, she tramped through the woods hour after hour, poking about  among the dead leaves, the snapping twigs, the velvety moss, the  fallen logs, the young spring growth of the little plants and  creepers, always keeping her eyes on the ground where she knew the  nest would be found. Day after day she continued the search. Every  time she saw a little hump of dead leaves or twigs and grasses her  heart bounded with hope, but on closer examination she found no nest  at all. Finally, one day when she was becoming discouraged, she spied  in the path a little brownish olive bird, about the size of an English  sparrow, but with a speckled, thrush-like breast and a dull orange  V-shaped patch, bordered by black lines, on the top of his head. He  was walking about on the ground, nodding his head as if {60} marking  time, not hopping, sparrow-fashion; and he took very dainty, pretty  steps that suggested a French dancing master. Occasionally he would  scratch the path for insects, like a tiny chicken. Although she had  never seen the teacher, and had expected that the loud voice came from  a much larger bird, she felt sure that this must be he, so she sat  down on a log and watched and waited. Presently she saw him tug at a  fine black hair-like root that lay across the path, and, snapping it  off, quickly fly away, away--oh, where did he go with it? She ran  stumbling after him through the undergrowth to a little clearing.  There another bird, just like him, whom she instantly guessed was his  mate, flew straight toward her, dropped to the ground, ran about  distractedly, dragging one wing as if it were broken, and uttering  sharp, piteous notes of alarm. The little girl didn't like to distress  the birds, of course, but how could she resist the temptation to find  their nest? So on she tramped around and around in an ever widening  circle, the excited birds still hovering near and sharply scolding  her. You may be sure she was quite as "]]]
