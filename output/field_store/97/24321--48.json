H. Parker of Harvard  University. Professor Parker noticed that during the warm spells in  winter the butterflies came out of their hiding places and after  alighting, always placed themselves with their heads away from the  direction of the sun and their bodies lying nearly at right angles to  the sun's rays. By experiment, he found that they adjusted themselves  to this position as soon as they were fully exposed to direct  sunshine, even if at the time of alighting they were in a shadow. He  found that this movement was a reflex action through the eyes, for  when the eyes were blinded no such adjustment took place. He called it  _negative heliotropism_.    Dr. Longstaff uses the term _orientation_ for this adjustment of the  butterfly to the sun's rays and he finds it is a very general habit,  especially with the Angle-wings, for the butterfly thus to orient  itself after alighting, in such a way that the hind end of the body  points toward the sun. This occurs not only with those species which  keep their wings spread open when they alight but also with those in  which the wings are closed together and held in a vertical position on  alighting.    Various explanations of this phenomenon have been offered but  apparently none of them are yet generally accepted. Were the habit  confined to butterflies like the Mourning Cloak, it would seem easy to  prove that a main advantage was found in the benefit derived from the  heat rays of the sun. Were it confined to those species which always  fold their wings on alighting, it would seem easy to believe that it  was a device for reducing the shadow cast by the insect to its lowest  terms. It has also been suggested that the habit is for the purpose of  revealing to the fullest extent the markings of the butterfly.  Evidently there is here an ample field for further investigation  before definite conclusions are reached.          LIST AND SHADOW OBSERVATIONS      Another field for most interesting studies upon the habits of living  butterflies has been opened up by the very interesting discussion of  _list and shadow_ in Colonel G. B. Longstaff's fascinating book,  \"Butterfly Hunting in Many Lands.\" He there summarizes his numerous  observations upon butterflies in various localities which he has seen  to lean over at a decided angle when they alight. He defines \"_List_\"  as \"an attitude resulting from the rotation of the insect about its  longitudinal axis, as heliotropism results from a rotation about an  imaginary vertical axis at right angles to this.\" The name is adapted  from the sailors' term applied to a vessel leaning to one side or  another in a storm.    Apparently this interesting habit was first called to the attention of  European entomologists by an observation of Colonel C. T. Bingham  made in 1878, but not published until long afterward. The observation  was this:    \"The _Melanitis_ was there among dead leaves, its wings folded and  looking for all the world a dead, dry leaf itself. With regard to  Melanitis, I have not seen it recorded anywhere that the species of  this genus when disturbed fly a little way, drop suddenly into the  undergrowth with closed wings, and invariably lie a little askew and  slanting, which still more increases their likeness to a dead leaf  casually fallen to the ground.\"    Long before this was printed, however, a similar habit had been  observed by Scudder in the case of our White Mountain butterfly  (_Oenis semidea_). But this species is so exceptional in its habitat  that the habit seems to have been considered a special adaptation to  the wind-swept mountain top. The possibility of its being at all  general among the butterflies in lowlands seems to have been  overlooked.    The observations recorded by Longstaff relate chiefly to various  members of the Satyrid group. For example, a common Grayling, _Satyrus  semele_, was watched many times as it settled on the ground. As a rule  three motions are gone through in regular sequence: the wings are  brought together over the back; the forewings are drawn between the  hind wings; the whole is thrown over to right or left to the extent of  thirty, forty, or even fifty degrees.    This habit, of course, is of advantage to the insect. It seems  possible that the advantage might be explained in either of two ways:  first, the leaning over on the ground among grasses and fallen leaves  might help to render the disguising coloration of the insect more  effective, the large ocelli serving to draw the eye away from the  outline of body and wing; second, the listing of the butterfly toward  the sun tends to reduce the shadow and to hide it beneath the wings.  There is no doubt that when a Grayling butterfly lights upon the  ground in strong sunshine the shadow it casts is more conspicuous than  the insect itself and the hiding of this might be of distinct  advantage in helping it to escape observation. It is significant that  in England the butterflies observed appear to lean over more  frequently in sunshine than in shade. An observation of Mr. E. G.  Waddilove, reported by Colonel Longstaff, is interesting in this  connection:    \"A Grayling settled on a patch of bare black peat earth, shut up its  wings vertically, and crawled at once some two yards to the edge of  the patch to where some fir-needles, a cone or two, and a few brittle  twigs were lying, and then becoming stationary threw itself over at an  angle of some forty-five degrees square to the sun. It thus became  quite indistinguishable from its surroundings.\"    Apparently, some of the Angle-wings may have the same habit, for in  Barrett's \"Lepidoptera of the British Islands,\" there is a note in  regard to _Grapta C-album_ to the effect that it is fond of sunning  itself in roads, on warm walls, or on the ground upon dead leaves in  sheltered valleys. \"Here, if the sun becomes overclouded, it will  sometimes close its wings and almost lie down, in such a manner that  to distinguish its brown and green marbled under side from the dead  leaves is almost impossible.\"    Here is a most fascinating opportunity for American observers to  determine definitely the facts in regard to our numerous species of  butterflies that may show this habit. An observer with a reflex type  of camera might easily be able to get pictures that would be of great  value in helping to determine the principal facts in regard to the  subject. Our common Graylings and numerous species of Angle-wings are  so abundant and easily observed that they offer splendid opportunities  to any one who will undertake a serious study of the subject.          PARASITIC ENEMIES      All three of the earlier stages of butterflies--egg, larva, and  chrysalis--are subject to attack by various parasitic insects which  develop at the expense of the host. Such parasites are probably the  most important check upon the increase of butterflies, and along with  birds, mammals, and bacterial diseases, they help to keep up that  balance of nature which in the long run maintains a surprising  uniformity in the numbers of each kind of butterfly.    For the most part these insect parasites are small four-winged flies,  although many of them are two-winged flies. In either case the life  stages show a series of changes much like those of the butterflies  themselves. Each parasite exists first as an egg, second as a larva,  third as a pupa, and fourth as an adult fly. The larval stage,  however, is simply that of a footless grub which lives within the body  of its victim absorbing its life blood and gradually killing it.    The parasites of butterfly eggs are legion. They are tiny flies whose  life-story in briefest summary is this: The butterfly lays an egg. The  parasite fly finds this egg soon after it is laid, and pierces the  shell with her tiny, sharply pointed ovipositor and deposits inside of  the shell her own microscopic egg. This egg within the egg soon  hatches into a curious little larva that develops at the expense of  the contents of the butterfly egg shell, and soon absorbs the whole  of them. The parasite larva now changes to a pupa which a little later  changes again to an adult fly like the one that laid the parasite egg  in the beginning. Of course the butterfly egg never hatches into a  caterpillar.    One of the most interesting questions in regard to these egg parasites  is this: How does the tiny parasitic fly find the newly laid egg? One  would think that the proverbial search for a needle in a haymow would  be an easy task compared with that of a fly about as large as the head  of a pin finding a butterfly egg of similar size upon some part of one  of the millions of leaves upon the trees and shrubs in field and  forest. Yet the search is successful, as every one who has tried to  get caterpillars from eggs found out of doors will testify. On a later  page in this book, in connection with the story of the life of the  Mourning Cloak butterfly, I have recorded some observations upon the  little parasite which seemed to have been riding around upon the body  of the butterfly waiting for her to lay her eggs.    For one parasite upon the eggs of butterflies, there probably are  dozens that attack the caterpillars. A large proportion of the  butterfly larvae brought in from outdoors, especially those which are  half-grown or more, will yield not butterflies but parasites. This is  the experience of practically every one who attempts to rear these  insects, and it emphasizes the value of the advice that in order to  get fine specimens, it is desirable to rear them from eggs laid by  butterflies beneath netting or in cages.    The life-histories of the parasites that attack caterpillars vary  greatly. The simplest are those of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#8)"],[1,"bonds,  one, is taken as the unit. Valence has always to be taken into  account in writing the symbol of a compound. It is often written  above and after the elements [i.e. written like an exponent], as  K^I, Mg^II.    An element having a valence of one is a monad; of two, a dyad;  three, a triad; four, tetrad; five, pentad; six, hexad, etc. It  is also said to be monovalent, di- or bivalent, etc. This theory  of bonds shows why an atom cannot exist alone. It would have free  or unused bonds, and hence must combine with its fellow to form a  molecule, in case of an element as well as in that of a compound.  This is illustrated by these graphic symbols in which there are  no free bonds: H-H, O=O, N[3-bond symbol]N, C[4-bond symbol]C. A  graphic symbol shows apparent molecular structure.    After all, how do we know that there are twice as many Cl atoms  in the chloride of magnesium as in that of sodium? The compounds  have been analyzed over and over again, and have been found to  correspond to the symbols MgCl2 and NaCl. This will be better  understood after studying the chapter on atomic weights. In  writing the symbol for the union of H with O, if we take an atom  of each, the bonds do not balance, H-=O, the former having one;  the latter, two. Evidently two atoms of H are needed, as H-O-H,  or    H    = O , or H2O. In the union of Zn and O, each has two bonds;  H    hence they unite atom with atom, Zn = O, or ZnO.    Write the grapbic and the common symbols for the union of H^I and  Cl^I; of K^I and Br^I; Ag^I and O^II; Na^I and S^II; H^I and  P^III. Study valences. It will be seen that some elements have a  variable quantivalence. Sn has either 2 or 4; P has 3 or 5. It  usually varies by two for a given element, as though a pair of  bonds sometimes saturated each other;. e.g. =Sn=, a quantivalence  of 4, and |Sn=, a quantivalence of 2. There are, therefore, two  oxides of tin, SnO and SnO2, or Sn=O and O=Sn=O. Write symbols  for the two chlorides of tin; two oxides of P; two oxides of  arsenic.    The chlorides of iron are FeCl2 and Fe2Cl6. In the latter, it  might be supposed that the quantivalence of Fe is 3, but the  graphic symbol shows it to be 4. It is called a pseudo-triad, or  false triad. Cr and Al are also pseudo-triads.    Cl  Cl |   | Cl--Fe--Fe--Cl |   | Cl  Cl    Write formulae for two oxides of iron; the oxide of Al.    57. A Radical is a Group of Elements which has no separate  existence, but enters into combination like a single atom; e.g.  (NO3) in the compounds HNO3 or KNO3; (SO4) in H2SO4. In HNO3 the  radical has a valence of 1, to balance that of H, H-NO3). In  H2SO4, what is the valence of (SO4)? Give it in each of these  radicals, noting first that of the first element: K(NO3),  Na2(SO4), Na2(CO3), K(ClO3), H3(PO4), Ca3(PO4)2, Na4(SiO4).    Suppose we wish to know the symbol for calcium phosphate. Ca and  PO4 are the two parts. In H3(PO4) the radical is a triad, to  balance H3. Ca is a dyad, Ca==(P04). The least common multiple of  the bonds (2 and 3) is 6, which, divided by 2 (no. Ca bonds),  gives 3 (no. Ca atoms to be taken). 6 / 3 (no. (PO4) bonds) gives  2 (no. PO4 radicals to be taken). Hence the symbol Ca3(P04)2.  Verify this by writing graphically.    Write symbols for the union of Mg and (SO4), Na and (PO4), Zn and  (NO3), K and (NO3), K and (SO4), Mg and (PO4), Fe and (SO4) (both  valences of Fe), Fe and (NO3), taking the valences of the  radicals from HNO3, H2SO4, H3PO4.    Chapter XII.    ELECTRO-CHEMICAL RELATION OF ELEMENTS.    58. Examine untarnished pieces of iron, silver, nickel, lead,  etc.; also quartz, resin, silk, wood, paper. Notice that from the  first four light is reflected in a different way from that of the  others. This property of reflecting light is known as luster.  Metals have a metallic luster which is peculiar to themselves;  and this, for the present, may be regarded as their chief  characteristic. Are they at the positive or negative end of the  list? See page 43. How is it with the non-metals? This  arrangement has a significance in chemistry which we must now  examine. The three appended experiments show how one metal can be  withdrawn from solution by a second, this second by a third, the  third by a fourth, and so on. For expedition, three pupils can  work together for the three following experiments, each doing  one, and examining the results of the others.    59. Deposition of Silver.    Experiment 35.--Put a ten-cent Ag coin into an evaporating-dish,  and pour over it a mixture of 5 cc. HNO3 and 10 cc. H2O. Warm  till all, or nearly all, the Ag dissolves. Remove the lamp. 3 Ag  + 4 HNO3 = 3 AgNO3 + 2 H2O + NO. Then add 10 cc. H2O, and at once  put in a short piece of Cu wire, or a cent. Leave till quite a  deposit appears, then pour off the liquid, wash the deposit  thoroughly, and remove it from the coin. See whether the metal  resembles Ag. 2 AgNO3 + Cu =?60. Deposition of Copper.    Experiment 36.--Dissolve a cent or some Cu turnings in dilute  HNO3, as in Experiment 35, and dilute the solution. 3 Cu + 8 HN09  - 3 Cu (NOA+4 H2O+2 NO.)    Then put in a clean strip of Pb, and set aside as before,  examining the deposit finally. Cu(NO3), + Pb - ?    61. Deposition of Lead.    Experiment 37.--Perform this experiment in the same manner as the  two previous ones, dissolving a small piece of Pb, and using a  strip of Zn to precipitate the Pb. 3 Pb + 8 HNO3 - 3 Pb (NO4)2 +  4 Ha0 + 2 NO. Pb (NO3) 2 + Zn = ? h.    62. Explanation. -These experiments show that Cu will replace Ag  in a solution of AgNO3, that Pb will replace and deposit Cu from  a similar compound, and that Zn will deposit Pb in the same way.  They show that the affinity of Zn for (NO3) is stronger than  either Ag, Cu, or Pb. We. express this affinity by saying that Zn  is the most positive of the four metals, while Ag is the most  nega- tive. Cu is positive to Ag, but negative to Pb and Zn.  Which of the four elements are positive to Pb, and which  negative? Mg would withdraw Zn from a similar solution, and be in  its turn withdrawn by Na. The table on page 43 is founded on this  relation. A given element is positive to every element above it  in the list, and negative to all below it.    Metals are usually classed as positive, non-metals as negative.  Each in union with O and 1=I gives rise to a very important class  of compounds,=--the negative to acids, the positive to bases.    In the following, note whether the positive or the negative  element is written first:--HCl, Na20,-As2S3, -MgBr2, Ag2S. Na2SO4  is made up of two parts, Na2 being positive, the radical SO4  negative. Like elements, radicals are either positive or  negative. In the following, separate the positive element from  the negative radical by a vertical line: Na2CO3, NaNO3, ZnSO4,  KClO3.    The most common positive radical is NH4, ammonium, as in NH4Cl.  It always deports itself as a metal. The commonest radical is the  negative OH, called hydroxyl, from hydrogen- oxygen. Take away H  from the symbol of water, H-O-H, and hydroxyl --(OH) with one  free bond is left. If an element takes the place of H, i.e.  unites with OH, the compound is called a hydrate. KOH is  potassium hydrate. Name NaOH, Ca(OH)2, NH4OH, Zn(OH)2, Al2(OH)6.  Is the first part of each symbol above positive or negative?    H has an intermediate place in the list. It is a constituent of  both acids and bases, and of the neutral substance, water.    ORDER.    --      Negative or Non-Metallic Elements.  Acid-forming with H(usually OH).

The following experiment is to be performed only by the teacher,  but pupils should make drawings and explain.    63. Decomposition of Water.    Experiment 38.--Arrange \"in series\" two or more cells of a Bunsen  battery (Physics, page 164), [References are made in this book to  Gage's Introduction to Physical Science.] and attach the terminal  wires to an electrolytic apparatus (Fig. 19) filled with water  made slightly acid with H2SO4. Construct a diagram of the  apparatus, marking the Zn in the liquid +, since it is positive,  and the C, or other element, -. Mark the electrode attached to  the Zn -, and that attached to the C +; positive electricity at  one end of a body commonly implies negative at the other.  Opposites attract, while like electricities repel each other.  These analogies will aid the memory. At the + electrode is the -  element of H2O, and at the - electrode the + element. Note, page  43, whether H or O is positive with reference to the other, and  write the symbol for each at the proper electrode. Compare the  diagram with the apparatus, to verify your conclusion. Why does  gas collect twice as fast at one electrode as at the other? What  does this prove of the composition of water? When filled, test  the gases in each tube, for O and H, with a burning stick.  Electrical analysis is called electrolysis.    If a solution of NaCl be electrolyzed, which element will go to  the + pole? Which, if the salt were K2SO4? Explain these  reactions in the electrolysis of that salt. K2SO4 = K2 + S03 + O.  SO4 is unstable, and breaks up into SO3 and O. Both K and SO3  have great affinity for water. K2 + 2 H2O = 2 KOH + H2. S03 + H2O  = H2SO4.    The base KOH would be found at the - electrode, and the acid  H2SO4 at the + electrode.    The positive portion, K, uniting with H2O forms a base; the  negative part, S03, with H2O forms an acid. Of what does this  show a salt to be composed?    64. Conclusions.--These experiments show (1) that at the +  electrode there always appears the negative element, or radical,  of the compound, and at the - electrode the positive element; (2)  that these "]]]
