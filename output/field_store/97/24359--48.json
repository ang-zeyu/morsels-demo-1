Most Moslems shave the head, but the Arabs let their hair grow  very long, and wear it in a number of long plaits, and these elf-locks  mixed up with the long coloured tassels of the _kiffiyeh_, and the  dark glittering eyes looking out from under the yellow silk, give them  an appearance of extreme wildness, aided by the long guns which they  carry and their long desert stride.    The Arab moves as if he were the ruler of the country, though the grip  of the Osmanli may be closing on him. His eyes are deeply set under  shaggy eyebrows, his nose is high and sharp, he is long and thin, his  profile suggests a bird of prey, and his demeanour a fierce  independence.    The Arab women go about the streets unveiled, and with the _abba_  covering their very poor clothing, but it is not clutched closely  enough to conceal the extraordinary tattooing which the Bedouin women  everywhere regard as ornamental. There are artists in Baghdad who make  their living by this mode of decorating the person, and vie with each  other in the elaboration of their patterns. I saw several women  tattooed with two wreaths of blue flowers on their bosoms linked by a  blue chain, palm fronds on the throat, stars on the brow and chin, and  bands round the wrists and ankles. These disfigurements, and large  gold or silver filigree buttons placed outside one nostril by means of  a wire passed through it, worn by married women, are much admired.  When these women sell country produce in the markets, they cover their  heads with the ordinary _chadar_.    The streets are narrow, and the walls, which are built of fire-burned  bricks, are high. Windows to the streets are common, and the oriel  windows, with their warm brown lattices projecting over the roadways  at irregular heights, are strikingly picturesque. Not less so are  latticework galleries, which are often thrown across the street to  connect the two houses of wealthy residents, and the sitting-rooms  with oriel windows, which likewise bridge the roadways. Solid doorways  with iron-clasped and iron-studded doors give an impression of  security, and suggest comfort and to some extent home life, and sprays  of orange trees, hanging over walls, and fronds of date palms give an  aspect of pleasantness to the courtyards.    The best parts of the city, where the great bazars, large  dwelling-houses, and most of the mosques are, is surrounded by a  labyrinth of alleys, fringing off into streets growing meaner till  they cease altogether among open spaces, given up to holes, heaps,  rubbish, the slaughter of animals, and in some favoured spots to the  production of vegetables. Then come the walls, which are of  kiln-burned bricks, and have towers intended for guns at intervals.  The wastes within the walls have every element of decay and meanness,  the wastes without, where the desert sands sweep up to the very foot  of the fortifications, have many elements of grandeur.    Baghdad is altogether built of chrome-yellow kiln-dried bricks. There  are about twenty-five kilns, chiefly in the hands of Jews and  Christians in the wastes outside the city, but the demand exceeds the  supply, not for building only, but for the perpetual patchings which  houses, paths, and walls are always requiring, owing to the absorption  of moisture in the winter.    Bricks at the kilns sell for 36s. per thousand twelve inches square,  and 18s. per thousand seven inches square. They are carried from the  kilns on donkeys, small beasts, each taking ten large or twenty-five  small bricks.    Unskilled labour is abundant. Men can be engaged at 9d. a day, and  boys for 5d.    This afternoon, in the glory of a sunset which reddened the yellow  waste up to the distant horizon, a caravan of mules, mostly in single  file, approached the city. Each carried two or four white bales slung  on his sides, or two or more long boxes, consisting of planks roped  rather than nailed together. This is the fashion in which thousands of  Persian Moslems (Shiahs or \"Sectaries\") have been conveyed for ages  for final burial at Kerbela, the holiest place of the Shiahs, an easy  journey from Baghdad, where rest the ashes of Ali, regarded as  scarcely second to Mohammed, and of Houssein and Hassan his sons,  whose \"martyrdom\" is annually commemorated by a Passion Play which is  acted in every town and village in Persia. To make a pilgrimage to  Kerbela, or to rest finally in its holy dust, or both, constitutes  the ambition of every Shiah. The Sunnis, or \"Orthodox,\" who hate the  Shiahs, are so far kept in check that these doleful caravans are not  exposed to any worse molestation than the shouts and ridicule of  street Arabs.    The mode of carrying the dead is not reverent. The _katirgis_, who  contract for the removal, hurry the bodies along as goods, and pile  them in the yards of the caravanserais at night, and the mournful  journey is performed, oftener than not, without the presence of  relations, each body being ticketed with the name once borne by its  owner. Some have been exhumed and are merely skeletons, others are in  various stages of decomposition, and some are of the newly dead.[6]    Outside the walls predatory Arabs render the roads unsafe for solitary  travellers, and at times for feeble caravans; but things in this  respect are better than they were.    Visits to the Armenian and Chaldaean Churches, to the Mosque of Abdel  Kader, with its courts thronged by Afghan pilgrims, and to the Jewish  quarter, have been very interesting. There are said to be 30,000 Jews  here, and while a large proportion of them are in poverty, on the  whole they are an influential nationality, and some of them are very  rich.    Through the liberality of Sir Albert Sassoon a Jewish High School has  been opened, where an admirable education is given. I was extremely  pleased with it, and with the director, who speaks French fluently,  and with the proficiency in French of the elder students. He describes  their earnestness and energetic application as being most remarkable.    The French Carmelite monks have a large, solid \"Mission Church\" or  Cathedral with a fine peal of bells, and a very prosperous school  attached, in which are boys belonging to all the many creeds professed  in Baghdad. The sisters of St. Joseph have a school for girls, which  Turkish children are not slow to avail themselves of. The sisters find  a remarkable unhandiness among the women. Few, if any, among them have  any idea of cutting out or repairing, and rich and poor are equally  incapable of employing their fingers usefully.    The people here are so used to the sight of Europeans that it is quite  easy for foreign ladies to walk in this quarter only attended by a  servant, and I have accompanied Mrs. Sutton on visits to several  Armenian houses. The Armenians are in many cases wealthy, as their  admirably-designed and well-built houses testify. The Christian  population is estimated at 5000, and its wealth and energy give it  greater importance than its numbers warrant. One of the houses which  we visited was truly beautiful and in very good taste, the solidity of  the stone and brickwork, the finish of the wood, and the beauty of the  designs and their execution in hammered iron being quite remarkable.  The lofty roofs and cornices are elaborately worked in plaster, and  this is completely concealed by hundreds or thousands of mirrors set  so as to resemble facets, so that roof and cornices flash like  diamonds. This is a Persian style of decoration, and is extremely  effective in large handsome rooms. Superb carpets and divans and tea  tables inlaid with mother-of-pearl furnish the reception and smoking  rooms, and the bedrooms and nurseries over which we were taken were  simply arranged with French bedsteads and curtains of Nottingham  mosquito net. As in other Eastern houses, there were no traces of  occupation, no morning room or den sacred to litter; neither was there  anything to look at--the opposite extreme from our overloaded  drawing-rooms--or any library. Cigarettes and black coffee in minute  porcelain cups, in gold filigree receptacles, were presented on each  occasion, and the kind and courteous intention was very pleasing.    The visits which I paid with Dr. Sutton were very different. He has  worked as a medical missionary here for some years, and his unaffected  benevolence and quiet attention to all suffering persons, without  distinction of race or creed, and his recent extraordinary labours by  night and day among the cholera-smitten people, have won for him  general esteem and confidence, and he is even allowed to enter Moslem  houses and prescribe for the women in some cases.    The dispensary, in which there is not half enough accommodation, is  very largely attended by people of all creeds, and even Moslem women,  though exclusively of the poorer classes, avail themselves of it.  Yesterday, when I was there, the comfortable seats of the cheerful  matted waiting-room were all occupied by Armenian and Chaldaean women,  unveiled and speaking quite freely to Dr. Sutton; while a few Moslem  women, masked rather than veiled, and enveloped in black sheets,  cowered on the floor and scarcely let their voices be heard even in a  tremulous whisper.    I am always sorry to see any encroachment made by Christian teachers  on national customs where they are not contrary to morality, and  willingly leave to Eastern women the _pardah_ and the veil, but still  there is a wholesomeness about the unveiled, rosy, comely, frank faces  of these Christian women. But--and it is a decided but--though the  women were comely, and though some of the Armenian girls are  beautiful, every one has one or more flattish depressions on her  face--scars in fact--the size of a large date stone. Nearly the whole  population is thus disfigured. So universal is it among the  fair-skinned Armenian girls, that so far from being regarded as a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38828"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 2 (of 2) (#8)"],[1,"gionists. \"Feringhis don't fear God,\" he said  to me; \"they never worship.\" I told him he was wrong, that many are  very devout. He said, \"Does ---- pray?\" mentioning a European. I said  \"Most certainly,\" and he walked away with the sneering laugh of a  fiend. He is a complete child of nature. He says what he thinks, and  acts chiefly as he pleases, but withal there is a gentlemanliness and  a considerable dignity about him. I think that his ruling religion is  loyalty to Isfandyar Khan, and consequent hatred of the Ilkhani and  all his other enemies. Going through a pantomimic firing of an English  rifle he said, \"I hope I may shoot the Shah with this one day!\" \"For  what reason?\" I asked. \"Because he murdered Isfandyar Khan's father,  and I hate him.\" I asked him if he liked shooting, and he replied, \"I  like shooting men!\"    He has done a good deal of fighting, and has been shot through the  lung, arm, and leg, besides getting sword cuts, and he takes some  pride in showing his wounds. I think he is faithful. Mirza says that  he has smoothed many difficulties, and has put many crooked things  straight, without taking any credit to himself. His most apparent  faults are greed and a sort of selfish cunning.    There are many camps about the Gal-i-Gav, and crowds, needing very  careful watching, are always about the tents, wanting to see Feringhi  things, most of the people never having seen a Feringhi. It is a novel  sight in the evenings when long lines of brown sheep in single file  cross the snow-fields, following the shepherds into camp.    This Gal-i-Gav on the Kuh-i-Rang marks a new departure on the journey,  as well as the establishment of certain geographical facts. It will be  impossible for the future to place the source of the Karun in the Zard  Kuh range, for we followed the stream up to the Kuh-i-Rang, or to  indulge in the supposition that the mountains which lie to the  north-west are \"covered with eternal snow,\" which in this latitude  would imply heights from 17,000 to 20,000 feet.    It is indeed a disappointment that, look where one may over the great  area filled up by huge rock barriers and vast mountains, from the  softer ridges bounding the fiery Persian plains to the last hills in  which the Inner range descends upon the great alluvial levels of  Khuzistan, not a peak presents itself in the glittering snowy mantle  which I have longed to see. Snow in forlorn patches or nearly hidden  in sunless rifts, and the snow-fields of the Zard Kuh will remain for  a time, but eternal snow is--nowhere, and it does not appear that the  highest of the peaks much exceeds 13,000 feet, either in Upper Elam or  the Bakhtiari country.    Great difficulties are ahead, not only from tracks which are said to  be impassable for laden animals, but from the disturbed state of the  country. From what I hear from Aziz Khan and from the guides who have  come up here, I gather that the power of the Ilkhani, shaky enough  even nearer Ardal, all but dwindles away here, and is limited to the  collection of the tribute, the petty Khans fighting among themselves,  and doing mainly what is right in their own eyes.    It is somewhat of a satisfaction to me that it is impossible now to go  back, and that a region absolutely unexplored lies ahead, doubtless  full, as the previously untraversed regions have been, of surprises  and interests.

I found it equally efficacious  afterwards in several cases of acute rheumatism with fever. I hope  that the general reader will excuse the medical and surgical notes  given in these letters. I am anxious to show the great desire for  European medical aid, and the wide sphere that is open to a medical  missionary, at least for physical healing.

[4] _Six Months in Persia._--Stack.          LETTER XVIII           CAMP GOKUN, _July 6_.    A descent of 5000 feet brought us into the grand and narrow gorge of  the Sahid stream, with willow, walnut, oak, maple, pear, and crab  along its banks, knotted together by sprays of pink roses, with oaks  higher up, and above them again overhanging mountains of naked rock,  scorched, and radiating heat.    Quite suddenly, after a steep ascent, there is a view of a steep slope  below, where a lateral ravine comes down on the Sahid, green with  crops of wheat and barley, poplars, willows, and a grove of fine  walnuts, and more wonderful still, with an _imamzada_ in good repair,  and a village, also named Sahid, in which people live all the year.  The glen is magnificent, and is the one spot that I have seen in  Persia which suggests Switzerland.    It is a steep and difficult descent through a walnut grove to the  village, and before I knew it I was on the roof of a house. The  village is built in ten steps up the steep hillside, the posts which  support one projecting roof resting on the back of the roof below.    The people were timid and suspicious, gave untrue replies to questions  at first, said we were \"doing talisman to take their country,\" and  consulted in Aziz's and Mirza's hearing how they might rob us. It was  even difficult to get them to bring fodder for the horses. They were  fanatical and called us _Kafirs_. Some of the women have never been  out of their romantic mountain-walled hole, in which they are shut up  by snow for four months every winter. Ten families live there, each  one possessing a step. They said they owned sixty-five goats and  sheep, five cows, and seven asses; that they sell their wheat, and  salt from a salt spring at the back of the hill, and that their food  is chiefly acorn flour made into bread, curds, and wild celery.    This bread is made from the fruit of the _Quercus ballota_, which is  often nearly three inches long. The acorns are not gathered, but  picked up when they fall. The women bruise them between stones to  expel the bitter juices. They are afterwards reduced to flour, which  is well washed to remove the remaining bitterness, and dried in the  sun. It is either made into thin cakes and baked, or is mixed into a  paste with buttermilk and water and eaten raw. The baked cakes are not  very unpalatable, but the paste is nauseous. Acorn flour is never used  from choice.    The grain is exchanged for blue cottons and tobacco. It is not  possible to imagine a more isolated life. Tihran and Isfahan are names  barely known to these people, and the Shah is little more to them than  the Czar.    Near the _imamzada_ of Sahid is a burial-ground, rendered holy by the  dust of a _pir_ or saint who lies there. It has many headstones, and  one very large gray stone lion, on whose sides are rude carvings of a  gun, a sword, a dagger, a powder-flask, and a spear. On a few low  headstones a peculiar comb is carved, denoting that the grave is that  of a woman.    To several stones long locks of hair are attached, some black and  shining, others dead-looking and discoloured. It is customary for the  Bakhtiari women to sacrifice their locks to the memory of their  husbands and other near male relatives.    I think that they have a great deal of conjugal and family affection,  though their ways are rough, and that they mourn for their dead for a  considerable time. On one grave a young woman was rocking herself to  and fro, wailing with a sound like the Highland coronach, but longer  and more despairing. She was also beating her uncovered bosom  rhythmically, and had cut her face till the blood came. So apparently  absorbed was she in her grief that she took no notice of a Feringhi  and an Indian. She had been bereaved of her husband for a year, his  life having been sacrificed in a tribal fight.    The next two days were occupied in what might well be called  \"mountaineering\" on goat tracks; skirting great mountain spurs on  shelving paths not always wide enough for a horse's two feet alongside  of each other, with precipitous declivities of 1000 or 2000 feet;  ascending on ledges of rock to over 9000 feet, then by frightful  tracks descending 2000 or 3000 but to climb again; and at every  descent always seeing in front dizzy zigzags surmounting the crest of  some ragged ridge, only, as one knows, to descend again. _Screw_  nearly fell over backwards with me once and again, and came down a  smooth face of rock as mules sometimes come down a snow slide in  Switzerland. I was told that I should \"break my neck\" many times, that  no Bakhtiari had ever ridden over these tracks, or ever would, but my  hurt knee left me no choice. These tracks are simply worn by the  annual passage of the nomads and their flocks. They are frightful  beyond all description. The worst paths in Ladak and Nubra are nothing  to them.    Occasionally we traversed deep ravines with noisy torrents where the  shade was dense, and willows, ash, walnut, cherry, elm, plum, and oak  were crowded together, with the _Juniperus excelsa_ in rifts above.  With a moist climate it would be a glorious land, but even where the  scenery is finest there is always something lacking. There is no  atmosphere. All is sharp, colourless, naked. Even many of the flowers  are queer, and some are positively ugly. Many have thorns, some are  leather-like, others woolly, a few sticky. Inconspicuous flowers and  large leathery leaves are very common. The seed-vessels of some are  far prettier than the flowers, and brighter in colour. In several the  calyx grows after the corolla has withered, and becomes bright pink or  orange, like a very gay but only partially-opened blossom.  _Umbelliferae_ predominate this month. _Compositae_ too are numerous.
