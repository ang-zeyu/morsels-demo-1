And in the glowing fire  the pigskin swelled itself into a strange shape.    But Brock was not left to work the bellows in peace. In to the forge  flew a gadfly. It lighted on Brock's hands and stung them. The Dwarf  screamed with pain, but his hands still held the bellows, working it to  keep the fire steady, for he knew that the gadfly was Loki, and that  Loki was striving to spoil Sindri's work. Again the gadfly stung his  hands, but Brock, although his hands felt as if they were pierced with  hot irons, still worked the bellows so that the fire did not blaze up or  die down for a single instant.    Sindri came and looked into the fire. Over the shape that was rising  there he said words of magic. The gadfly had flown away, and Sindri bade  his brother cease working. He took out the thing that had been shaped in  the fire, and he worked over it with his hammer. It was a wonder  indeed--a boar, all golden, that could fly through the air, and that  shed light from its bristles as it flew. Brock forgot the pain in his  hands and screamed with joy. \"This is the greatest of wonders,\" he said.  \"The Dwellers in Asgard will have to give the judgment against Loki. I  shall have Loki's head!\"    But Sindri said, \"The boar Golden Bristle may not be judged as great a  wonder as the spear Gungnir or the boat Skidbladnir. We must make  something more wonderful still. Work the bellows as before, brother, and  do not let the fire die down or blaze up for a single instant.\"    Then Sindri took up a piece of gold that was so bright it lightened up  the dark cavern that the Dwarfs worked in. He threw the piece of gold  into the fire. Then he went to make ready something else and left Brock  to work the bellows.    The gadfly flew in again. Brock did not know it was there until it  lighted on the back of his neck. It stung him till Brock felt the pain  was wrenching him apart. But still he kept his hands on the bellows,  working it so that the fire neither blazed up nor died down for a single  instant. When Sindri came to look into the fire, Brock was not able to  speak for pain.    Again Sindri said magic words over the gold that was being smelted in  the fire. He took it out of the glow and worked it over on the  main-anvil. Then in a while he showed Brock something that looked like  the circle of their sun. \"A splendid armring, my brother,\" he said. \"An  armring for a God's right arm. And this ring has hidden wonders. Every  ninth night eight rings like itself will drop from this armring, for  this is Draupnir, the Ring of Increase.\"    \"To Odin, the Father of the Gods, the ring shall be given,\" said Brock.  \"And Odin will have to declare that nothing so wonderful or so  profitable to the Gods was ever brought into Asgard. O Loki, cunning  Loki, I shall have thy head in spite of thy tricks.\"    \"Be not too hasty, brother,\" said Sindri. \"What we have done so far is  good. But better still must be the thing that will make the Dwellers in  Asgard give the judgment that delivers Loki's head to thee. Work as  before, brother, and do not let the fire blaze up or die down for a  single instant.\"    This time Sindri threw into the fire a bar of iron. Then he went away to  fetch the hammer that would shape it. Brock worked the bellows as  before, but only his hands were steady, for every other part of him was  trembling with expectation of the gadfly's sting.    He saw the gadfly dart into the forge. He screamed as it flew round and  round him, searching out a place where it might sting him most  fearfully. It lighted down on his forehead, just between his eyes. The  first sting it gave took the sight from his eyes. It stung again and  Brock felt the blood flowing down. Darkness filled the cave. Brock tried  to keep his hands steady on the bellows, but he did not know whether the  fire was blazing up or dying down. He shouted and Sindri hurried up.    Sindri said the magic words over the thing that was in the fire. Then he  drew it out. \"An instant more,\" he said, \"and the work would have been  perfect. But because you let the fire die down for an instant the work  is not as good as it might have been made.\" He took what was shaped in  the fire to the main-anvil and worked over it. Then when Brock's  eyesight came back to him he saw a great hammer, a hammer all of iron.  The handle did not seem to be long enough to balance the head. This was  because the fire had died down for an instant while it was being formed.    \"The hammer is Mioelnir,\" said Sindri, \"and it is the greatest of the  things that I am able to make. All in Asgard must rejoice to see this  hammer. Thor only will be able to wield it. Now I am not afraid of the  judgment that the Dwellers in Asgard will give.\"    \"The Dwellers in Asgard will have to give judgment for us,\" Brock cried  out. \"They will have to give judgment for us, and the head of Loki, my  tormentor, will be given me.\"    \"No more wonderful or more profitable gifts than these have ever been  brought into Asgard,\" Sindri said. \"Thy head is saved, and thou wilt be  able to take the head of Loki who was insolent to us. Bring it here, and  we will throw it into the fire in the forge.\"    The AEsir and the Vanir were seated in the Council House of Asgard when a  train of Dwarfs appeared before them. Brock came at the head of the  train, and he was followed by a band of Dwarfs carrying things of great  weight. Brock and his attendants stood round the throne of Odin, and  hearkened to the words of the Father of the Gods.    \"We know why you have come into Asgard from out of Svartheim,\" Odin  said. \"You have brought things wonderful and profitable to the Dwellers  in Asgard. Let what you have brought be seen, Brock. If they are more  wonderful and more useful than the things Loki has brought out of  Svartheim, the spear Gungnir and the boat Skidbladnir, we will give  judgment for you.\"    Then Brock commanded the Dwarfs who waited on him to show the Dwellers  in Asgard the first of the wonders that Sindri had made. They brought  out the boar, Golden Bristle. Round and round the Council House the boar  flew, leaving a track of brightness. The Dwellers in Asgard said one to  the other that this was a wonder indeed. But none would say that the  boar was a better thing to have in Asgard than the spear that would hit  the mark no matter how badly it was flung, or the boat Skidbladnir that  would sail on any sea, and that could be folded up so small that it  would fit in any one's pocket: none would say that Golden Bristle was  better than these wonders.    To Frey, who was Chief of the Vanir, Brock gave the wondrous boar.    Then the attending Dwarfs showed the armring that was as bright as the  circle of the Sun. All admired the noble ring. And when it was told how  every ninth night this ring dropped eight rings of gold that were like  itself, the Dwellers in Asgard spoke aloud, all saying that Draupnir,  the Ring of Increase, was a wonder indeed. Hearing their voices raised,  Brock looked triumphantly at Loki who was standing there with his lips  drawn closely together.    To Odin, the Father of the Gods, Brock gave the noble armring.    Then he commanded the attending Dwarfs to lay before Thor the hammer  Mioelnir. Thor took the hammer up and swung it around his head. As he did  so he uttered a great cry. And the eyes of the Dwellers in Asgard  lightened up when they saw Thor with the hammer Mioelnir in his hands;  their eyes lightened up and from their lips came the cry, \"This is a  wonder, a wonder indeed! With this hammer in his hand none can withstand  Thor, our Champion. No greater thing has ever come into Asgard than the  hammer Mioelnir.\"    Then Odin, the Father of the Gods, spoke from his throne, giving  judgment. \"The hammer Mioelnir that the Dwarf Brock has brought into  Asgard is a thing wonderful indeed and profitable to the Gods. In  Thor's hands it can crush mountains, and hurl the Giant race from the  ramparts of Asgard. Sindri the Dwarf has forged a greater thing than the  spear Gungnir and the boat Skidbladnir. There can be no other judgment.\"    Brock looked at Loki, showing his gnarled teeth. \"Now, Loki, yield your  head, yield your head,\" he cried.    \"Do not ask such a thing,\" said Odin. \"Put any other penalty on Loki for  mocking you and tormenting you. Make him yield to you the greatest thing  that it is in his power to give.\"    \"Not so, not so,\" screamed Brock. \"You Dwellers in Asgard would shield  one another. But what of me? Loki would have taken my head had I lost  the wager. Loki has lost his head to me. Let him kneel down now till I  cut it off.\"    Loki came forward, smiling with closed lips. \"I kneel before you,  Dwarf,\" he said. \"Take off my head. But be careful. Do not touch my  neck. I did not bargain that you should touch my neck. If you do, I  shall call upon the Dwellers in Asgard to punish you.\"    Brock drew back with a snarl. \"Is this the judgment of the Gods?\" he  asked.    \"The bargain you made, Brock,\" said Odin, \"was an evil one, and all its  evil consequences you must bear.\"    Brock, in a rage, looked upon Loki, and he saw that his lips were  smiling. He stamped his feet and raged. Then he went up to Loki and  said, \"I may not take your head, but I can do something with your lips  that mock me.\"    \"What would you do, Dwarf?\" asked Thor.    \"Sew Loki's lips together,\" said Brock, \"so that he can do no more  mischief with his talk. You Dwellers in Asgard cannot forbid me to do  this. Down, Loki, on your knees before me.\"    Loki looked round on the Dwellers in Asgard and he saw that their  judgment was that he must kneel before the Dwarf. He knelt down with a  frown upon his brow. \"Draw your lips together, Loki,\" said Brock. Loki  drew his lips together while his eyes flashed fire. With an awl that he  took from his belt Brock pierced Loki's lips. He took out a thong and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24750"],[0,"Mizora: A Prophecy (#6)"],[1,"upon it, another piece of  adamant was cemented over it.    Each day, as my acquaintance with the peculiar institutions and  character of the inhabitants of Mizora increased, my perplexity and a  certain air of mystery about them increased with it. It was impossible  for me not to feel for them a high degree of respect, admiration, and  affection. They were ever gentle, tender, and kind to solicitude. To  accuse them of mystery were a paradox; and yet they _were_ a mystery. In  conversation, manners and habits, they were frank to singularity. It was  just as common an occurrence for a poem to be read and commented on by  its author, as to hear it done by another. I have heard a poetess call  attention to the beauties of her own production, and receive praise or  adverse criticism with the same charming urbanity.    Ambition of the most intense earnestness was a natural characteristic,  but was guided by a stern and inflexible justice. Envy and malice were  unknown to them. It was, doubtless, owing to their elevated moral  character that courts and legal proceedings had become unnecessary. If a  discussion arose between parties involving a question of law, they  repaired to the Public Library, where the statute books were kept, and  looked up the matter themselves, and settled it as the law directed.  Should they fail to interpret the law alike, a third party was selected  as referee, but accepted no pay.    Indolence was as much a disgrace to them as is the lack of virtue to the  women of my country, hence every citizen, no matter how wealthy, had  some regular trade, business or profession. I found those occupations we  are accustomed to see accepted by the people of inferior birth and  breeding, were there filled by women of the highest social rank, refined  in manner and frequently of notable intellectual acquirements. It grew,  or was the result of the custom of selecting whatever vocation they felt  themselves competent to most worthily fill, and as no social favor or  ignominy rested on any kind of labor, the whole community of Mizora was  one immense family of sisters who knew no distinction of birth or  position among themselves.    There were no paupers and no charities, either public or private, to be  found in the country. The absence of poverty such as I knew existed in  all civilized nations upon the face of the earth, was largely owing to  the cheapness of food. But there was one other consideration that bore  vitally upon it. The dignity and necessity of labor was early and  diligently impressed upon the mind. The Preceptress said to me:    \"Mizora is a land of industry. Nature has taught us the duty of work.  Had some of us been born with minds fully matured, or did knowledge come  to some as old age comes to all, we might think that a portion was  intended to live without effort. But we are all born equal, and labor is  assigned to all; and the one who seeks labor is wiser than the one who  lets labor seek her.\"    Citizens, I learned, were not restrained from accumulating vast wealth  had they the desire and ability to do so, but custom imposed upon them  the most honorable processes. If a citizen should be found guilty of  questionable business transactions, she suffered banishment to a lonely  island and the confiscation of her entire estate, both hereditary and  acquired. The property confiscated went to the public schools in the  town or city where she resided; but never was permitted to augment  salaries. I discovered this in the statute books, but not in the memory  of any one living had it been found necessary to inflict such a  punishment.    \"Our laws,\" said Wauna, \"are simply established legal advice. No law can  be so constructed as to fit every case so exactly that a criminal mind  could not warp it into a dishonest use. But in a country like ours,  where civilization has reached that state of enlightenment that needs no  laws, we are simply guided by custom.\"    The love of splendor and ornament was a pronounced characteristic of  these strange people. But where gorgeous colors were used, they were  always of rich quality. The humblest homes were exquisitely ornamented,  and often displayed a luxury that, with us, would have been considered  an evidence of wealth.    They took the greatest delight in their beauty, and were exceedingly  careful of it. A lovely face and delicate complexion, they averred,  added to one's refinement. The art of applying an artificial bloom and  fairness to the skin, which I had often seen practiced in my own  country, appeared to be unknown to them. But everything savoring of  deception was universally condemned. They made no concealment of the  practice they resorted to for preserving their complexions, and so  universal and effectual were they, that women who, I was informed, had  passed the age allotted to the grandmothers in my country, had the  smooth brow and pink bloom of cheek that belongs to a more youthful  period of life. There was, however, a distinction between youth and old  age. The hair was permitted to whiten, but the delicate complexion of  old age, with its exquisite coloring, excited in my mind as much  admiration as astonishment.    I cannot explain why I hesitated to press my first inquiry as to where  the men were. I had put the question to Wauna one day, but she professed  never to have heard of such beings. It silenced me--for a time.    \"Perhaps it is some extinct animal,\" she added, naively. \"We have so  many new things to study and investigate, that we pay but little  attention to ancient history.\"    I bided my time and put the query in another form.    \"Where is your other parent?\"    She regarded me with innocent surprise. \"You talk strangely. I have but  one parent. How could I have any more?\"    \"You ought to have two.\"    She laughed merrily. \"You have a queer way of jesting. I have but one  mother, one adorable mother. How could I have two?\" and she laughed  again.    I saw that there was some mystery I could not unravel at present, and  fearing to involve myself in some trouble, refrained from further  questioning on the subject. I nevertheless kept a close observance of  all that passed, and seized every opportunity to investigate a mystery  that began to harass me with its strangeness.    Soon after my conversation with Wauna, I attended an entertainment at  which a great number of guests were present. It was a literary festival  and, after the intellectual delicacies were disposed of, a banquet  followed of more than royal munificence. Toasts were drank, succeeded by  music and dancing and all the gayeties of a festive occasion, yet none  but the fairest of fair women graced the scene. Is it strange,  therefore, that I should have regarded with increasing astonishment and  uneasiness a country in all respects alluring to the desires of man--yet  found him not there in lordly possession?    Beauty and intellect, wealth and industry, splendor and careful economy,  natures lofty and generous, gentle and loving--why has not Man claimed  this for himself?          CHAPTER V.      The Preceptress of the National College appointed her daughter Wanna as  a guide and instructor to me. I formed a deep and strong attachment for  her, which, it pains me to remember, was the cause of her unhappy fate.  In stature she was above the medium height, with a form of the fairest  earthly loveliness and exquisite grace. Her eyes were so deep a blue,  that at first I mistook them for brown. Her hair was the color of a ripe  chestnut frosted with gold, and in length and abundance would cover her  like a garment. She was vivacious and fond of athletic sports. Her  strength amazed me. Those beautiful hands, with their tapering fingers,  had a grip like a vise. They had discovered, in this wonderful land,  that a body possessing perfectly developed muscles must, by the laws of  nature, be symmetrical and graceful. They rode a great deal on small,  two-wheeled vehicles, which they propelled themselves. They gave me one  on which I accompanied Wauna to all of the places of interest in the  Capital city and vicinity.    I must mention that Wauna's voice was exceedingly musical, even in that  land of sweet voices, but she did not excel as a singer.    The infant schools interested me more than all the magnificence and  grandeur of the college buildings. The quaint courtesy, gentle manners  and affectionate demeanor of the little ones toward one another, was a  surprise to me. I had visited infant schools of my own and other  countries, where I had witnessed the display of human nature,  unrestrained by mature discretion and policy. Fights, quarrels, kicks,  screams, the unlawful seizure of toys and trinkets, and other  misdemeanors, were generally the principal exhibits. But here it was all  different. I thought, as I looked at them, that should a philanthropist  from the outside world have chanced unknowingly upon the playground of a  Mizora infant school, he would have believed himself in a company of  little angels.    At first, a kindness so universal impressed me as studied; a species of  refined courtesy in which the children were drilled. But time and  observation proved to me that it was the natural impulse of the heart,  an inherited trait of moral culture. In _my_ world, kindness and  affection were family possessions, extended occasionally to  acquaintances. Beyond this was courtesy only for the great busy bustling  mass of humanity called--\"the world.\"    It must not be understood that there was no variety of character in  Mizora. Just as marked a difference was to be found there as elsewhere;  but it was elevated and ennobled. Its evil tendencies had been  eliminated. There were many causes that had made this possible. The  first, and probably the most influential, was the extreme cheapness of  living. Food and fuel were items of so small consequence, that poverty  had become unknown. Added to this, and to me by far the"]]]
