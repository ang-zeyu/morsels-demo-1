However, thanks to my thoughtfulness, no troublesome thoughts  interfered to break my rest on the night preceding a day so important  to me, and I slept as tranquilly as though upon waking I had no other  occupation for my time than a walk on the boulevards, or a drive to the  Bois de Boulogne.    Comte Jean, however, had passed a very different night; for once, the  whisperings of ambition had overcome even his natural indifference and  carelessness, and tired of tossing upon a sleepless pillow, he arose  at the first break of day, reproached me for slumbering so long, and  allowed me neither peace nor rest till I joined him dressed for our  journey. At length, we set out according to our agreement with Lebel; I  was closely muffled up in my large _caleche_--the carriage rolled along  till we reached Versailles, where we had for the last month engaged a  lodging, which might be useful to us in all events; we alighted, and  after vainly seeking a few moments' repose, proceeded on foot to Lebel,  in whose apartments we were to attire ourselves in a suitable manner.    \"You are welcome,\" said the comte, \"pray consider yourself as at home.\"    \"I accept your augury,\" replied I, \"it would be amusing enough to find  that my young prophet had predicted rightly.\"    \"Well then,\" said my conductor, laughing, \"I recommend you to manage a  slip on the staircase, it would be taking possession after the manner of  the ancients.\"    \"No, no, I thank you,\" answered I; \"no falls if you please, they are not  propitious in France.\"    Whilst we were thus speaking, we were crossing a long suite of chambers,  and reached the one at which we were expected. We knocked cautiously  at a door, which was opened to us with equal caution. Scarcely had we  entered, than Lebel came eagerly forward to receive us.    \"Ah, madame!\" cried he, \"I began to fear you might not come, you have  been looked for with an impatience--\"    \"Which can hardly equal mine,\" interrupted I; \"for you were prepared  for your visitor, whilst I have yet to learn who is the friend that so  kindly desires to see me.\"    \"It is better it should be so,\" added Lebel; \"do not seek either to  guess or discover more, than that you will here meet with some cheerful  society, friends of mine, who will sup at my house, but with whom  circumstances prevent my sitting down at table.\"    \"How!\" said I, with affected surprise, \"not sup with us?\"    \"Even so,\" replied Lebel; and then added with a laugh, \"_He_ and I sit  down to supper together! What an idea! No! you will find that just as  the guests are about to sit down at table, I shall suddenly be called  out of the room, and shall only return at the close of the repast.\"    All this was but of small import to me. Nevertheless, I affected to  regret the unavoidable absence of Lebel. In fact, I believe that the  first breath inspired at court is fraught with falsehood and deceit,  entirely destructive to every feeling of natural candor.    Lebel, with the most ceremonious gallantry, conducted me to a private  dressing-room, where I found several females waiting to assist me at  my toilet; I abandoned myself to their cares, which were, indeed, most  skilfully exercised in my behalf. They wrought wonders in my appearance,  bathing me after the Eastern fashion, adorning my hair and person, till  I issued from their hands blooming and beauteous as an houri.    When I returned to the room in which Lebel was expecting me, his  surprise was almost overpowering.    \"You are, indeed,\" exclaimed he, \"the new sun which is to rise upon  Versailles.\"    \"Excellent!\" cried I, laughing extravagantly, \"but like the planet you  are pleased to compare me with, I must reserve my splendid rising till I  have obtained fresh powers from the aid of night.\"*         * _Mais avant de me lever il faut que je me couche_, is the       witty reply in the original, but which it is impossible to       render fully and piquantly through the dilution of a       translation.---tr.    The comte entered, and joined his congratulations upon the beauty of my  appearance; all at once the hasty, sound of a bell, violently pulled,  was heard.    \"The object of your attack approaches,\" said Lebel to me, \"it would be  as well to reconnoitre a little. Remember, not a word of his rank, no  cast down, timid looks at his sovereign power; no bending of knees, or  faltering of voice.\"    The advice thus given was useless. Comte Jean, who bore the reputation  of, at least, a man of much cool impudence, was, I am certain, more  deficient than myself in courage upon the occasion, and I verily  believe, asked himself several times whether he dared appear before his  prince with one whom he was falsely asserting to be his sister-in-law.  However these thoughts might or might not have disturbed him, we  proceeded onwards till we reached the apartment where our invited  friends were expecting us; and here I will, with the reader's  permission, digress awhile, in order to say a few introductory words  respecting the four personages with whom I had the honor of supping.    And first, Louis XVth, king of France (or as he was upon the present  occasion styled the baron de Gonesse), was one of those sentimental  egotists who believed he loved the whole world, his subjects, and his  family; while in reality, the sole engrossing object was _self_.  Gifted with many personal and intellectual endowments, which might have  disputed the palm with the most lively and engaging personages of the  court, he was yet devoured by ennui, and of this he was well aware,  but his mind was made up to meet this ennui, as one of the necessary  accompaniments of royalty. Devoid of taste in literary matters, he  despised all connected with the _belles-lettres_, and esteemed men only  in proportion to the number and richness of their armorial bearings. M.  de Voltaire ranked him beneath the lowest country-squire; and the very  mention of a man of letters was terrifying to his imagination from its  disturbing the current of his own ideas; he revelled in the plenitude  of power, yet felt dissatisfied with the mere title of king. He ardently  desired to signalize himself as the first general of the age, and  prevented from obtaining this (in his opinion) highest of honors,  entertained the utmost jealousy of Frederick II, and spoke with  undisguised spleen and ill-humor of the exploits of his brother of  Prussia.    The habit of commanding, and the prompt obedience he had ever met  with, had palled upon his mind, and impressed him with feelings of  indifference for all things which thus appeared so easily obtained;  and this satiety and consequent listlessness was by many construed into  melancholy of disposition. He disliked any appearance of opposition to  his will; not that he particularly resented the opposition itself, but  he knew his own weakness, and feared lest he should be compelled to make  a show of a firmness he was conscious of not possessing. For the clergy  he entertained the most superstitious veneration; and he feared God  because he had a still greater awe and dread of the devil. In the hands  of his confessor he confidently believed was lodged the absolute power  to confer on him unlimited license to commit any or every sin. He  greatly dreaded pamphlets, satires, epigrams, and the opinion of  posterity and yet his conduct was that of a man who scoffs at the  world's judgment. This hasty sketch may with safety be taken as the  portrait of Louis XV, although much might be added; yet for the present  I will confine myself to the outline of my picture, which I shall have  frequent occasion to retouch in the course of my journal; it is my  intention to present him in all possible lights before the reader, and  I flatter myself I shall produce a perfect resemblance of the man I seek  to depict. Let us now proceed to consider the duc de Richelieu.    This nobleman, when in his seventy-second year, had preserved, even in  so advanced an age, all his former pretensions to notice; his success in  so many love affairs, a success which he never could have merited, had  rendered him celebrated; he was now a superannuated coxcomb, a wearisome  and clumsy butterfly; when however, he could be brought to exercise his  sense by remembering that he was no longer young, he became fascinating  beyond idea, from the finished ease and grace of his manner, and the  polished and piquant style of his discourse; still I speak of him as  a mere man of outward show, for the duke's attainments were certainly  superficial, and he possessed more of the jargon of a man of letters  than the sound reality. Among other proofs of consummate ignorance he  was deficient even in orthography, and was fool enough to boast of  so disgraceful a fact, as though it conferred honor on him; perhaps,  indeed, he found that the easiest way of getting over the business.    He possessed a most ignoble turn of mind; all feelings of an elevated  nature were wanting within him. A bad son, an unkind husband, and a  worse father, he could scarcely be expected to become a steady friend.  All whom he feared, he hesitated not to trample under foot; and his  favorite maxim, which he has a hundred times repeated to me, was, that  \"we should never hesitate to set our foot upon the necks of all those  who might in any way interfere with our projects--dead men [he would  further add] tell no tales!\" There was one person, nevertheless, whom he  detested and flattered at the same time, and this was Voltaire, who well  repaid him in like coin. He called the duc de Richelieu, the tyrant of  the tennis-court* (_tripot_), and the duke returned the compliment  by invariably designating him \"Scoundrel\" and \"Poetaster\"; the only  difference was that the duc de Richelieu only treated the poet thus in  _sotto voce_, whilst M. de Voltaire sought not to conceal, either in his  writings or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25646"],[0,"Child's Health Primer For Primary Classes (#6)"],[1," bag and lay it away on a shelf for a few hours, and then show you  that the beef had disappeared, so had the apples, so had the potatoes,  the bread and milk, sugar, and salt, and the bag was filled only with a  thin, grayish fluid? Would you not call it a magical bag?    Now, your stomach and mine are just such magical bags.    We put in our breakfasts, dinners, and suppers; and, after a few hours,  they are changed. The gastric juice has been mixed with them. The strong  muscles that form the outside of the stomach have been squeezing the  food, rolling it about, and mixing it together, until it has all been  changed to a thin, grayish fluid.      HOW DOES ANYBODY KNOW THIS?    A soldier was once shot in the side in such a way that when the wound  healed, it left an opening with a piece of loose skin over it, like a  little door leading into his stomach.    A doctor who wished to learn about the stomach, hired him for a servant  and used to study him every day.    He would push aside the little flap of skin and put into the stomach any  kind of food that he pleased, and then watch to see what happened to it.    In this way, he learned a great deal and wrote it down, so that other  people might know, too. In other ways, also, which it would take too  long to tell you here, doctors have learned how these magical food-bags  take care of our food.      WHY DOES THE FOOD NEED TO BE CHANGED?    Your mamma tells you sometimes at breakfast that you must eat oat-meal  and milk to make you grow into a big man or woman.    Did you ever wonder what part of you is made of oat-meal, or what part  of milk?    That stout little arm does not look like oat-meal; those rosy cheeks do  not look like milk.    If our food is to make stout arms and rosy cheeks, strong bodies and  busy brains, it must first be changed into a form in which it can get to  each part and feed it.    When the food in the stomach is mixed and prepared, it is ready to be  sent through the body; some is carried to the bones, some to the  muscles, some to the nerves and brain, some to the skin, and some even  to the finger nails, the hair, and the eyes. Each part needs to be fed  in order to grow.      WHY DO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GROWING NEED FOOD?    Children need each day to make larger and larger bones, larger muscles,  and a larger skin to cover the larger body.    Every day, each part is also wearing out a little, and needing to be  mended by some new food. People who have grown up, need their food for  this work of mending.      CARE OF THE STOMACH.    One way to take care of the stomach is to give it only its own work to  do. The teeth must first do their work faithfully.    The stomach must have rest, too. I have seen some children who want to  make their poor stomachs work all the time. They are always eating  apples, or candy, or something, so that their stomachs have no chance to  rest. If the stomach does not rest, it will wear out the same as a  machine would.    The stomach can not work well, unless it is quite warm. If a person  pours ice-water into his stomach as he eats, just as the food is  beginning to change into the gray fluid of which you have learned, the  work stops until the stomach gets warm again.      ALCOHOL AND THE STOMACH.    You remember about the man who had the little door to his stomach.  Sometimes, the doctor put in wine, cider, brandy, or some drink that  contained alcohol, to see what it would do. It was carried away very  quickly; but during the little time it stayed, it did nothing but harm.    It injured the gastric juice, so that it could not mix with the food.    If the doctor had put in more alcohol, day after day, as one does who  drinks liquor, sores would perhaps have come on the delicate lining of  the stomach. Sometimes the stomach is so hurt by alcohol, that the  drinker dies. If the stomach can not do its work well, the whole body  must suffer from want of the good food it needs.[C]      TOBACCO AND THE MOUTH.    The saliva in the mouth helps to prepare the food, before it goes into  the stomach. Tobacco makes the mouth very dry, and more saliva has to  flow out to moisten it.    But tobacco juice is mixed with the saliva, and that must not be  swallowed. It must be spit out, and with it is sent the saliva that was  needed to help prepare the food.    Tobacco discolors the teeth, makes bad sores in the mouth, and often  causes a disease of the throat.    You can tell where some people have been, by the neatness and comfort  they leave after them.    You can tell where the tobacco-user has been, by the dirty floor, and  street, and the air made unfit to breathe, because of the smoke and  strong, bad smell of old tobacco from his pipe and cigar and from his  breath and clothes.

FOOTNOTE:    [Footnote C: The food is partly prepared by the liver and some other  organs.]          CHAPTER XI.    WHAT DOES THE BODY NEED FOR FOOD?      [Illustration: N]OW that you know how the body is fed, you must next  learn what to feed it with; and what each part needs to make it grow and  to keep it strong and well.      WATER.    A large part of your body is made of water. So you need, of course, to  drink water, and to have it used in preparing your food.    Water comes from the clouds, and is stored up in cisterns or in springs  in the ground. From these pipes are laid to lead the water to our  houses.    Sometimes, men dig down until they reach a spring, and so make a well  from which they can pump the water, or dip it out with a bucket.    Water that has been standing in lead pipes, may have some of the lead  mixed with it. Such water would be very likely to poison you, if you  drank it.    Impurities are almost sure to soak into a well if it is near a drain or  a stable.    If you drink the water from such a well, you may be made very sick by  it. It is better to go thirsty, until you can get good water.    A sufficient quantity of pure water to drink is just as important for  us, as good food to eat.    We could not drink all the water that our bodies need. We take a large  part of it in our food, in fruits and vegetables, and even in beefsteak  and bread.      LIME.    Bones need lime. You remember the bone that was nothing but crumbling  lime after it had been in the fire.    Where shall we get lime for our bones?    We can not eat lime; but the grass and the grains take it out of the  earth. Then the cows eat the grass and turn it into milk, and in the  milk we drink, we get some of the lime to feed our bones.    [Illustration: _Lime being prepared for our use._]    In the same way, the grain growing in the field takes up lime and other  things that we need, but could not eat for ourselves. The lime that thus  becomes a part of the grain, we get in our bread, oat-meal porridge, and  other foods.      SALT.    Animals need salt, as children who live in the country know very well.  They have seen how eagerly the cows and the sheep lick up the salt that  the farmer gives them.    Even wild cattle and buffaloes seek out places where there are salt  springs, and go in great herds to get the salt.    We, too, need some salt mixed with our food. If we did not put it in,  either when cooking, or afterward, we should still get a little in the  food itself.      FLESH-MAKING FOODS.    Muscles are lean meat, that is flesh; so muscles need flesh-making  foods. These are milk, and grains like wheat, corn and oats; also, meat  and eggs. Most of these foods really come to us out of the ground. Meat  and eggs are made from the grain, grass, and other vegetables that the  cattle and hens eat.      FAT-MAKING FOODS.    We need cushions and wrappings of fat, here and there in our bodies, to  keep us warm and make us comfortable. So we must have certain kinds of  food that will make fat.    [Illustration: _Esquimaux catching walrus._]    There are right places and wrong places for fat, as well as for other  things in this world. When alcohol puts fat into the muscles, that is  fat badly made, and in the wrong place.    The good fat made for the parts of the body which need it, comes from  fat-making foods.    In cold weather, we need more fatty food than we do in summer, just as  in cold countries people need such food all the time.    The Esquimaux, who live in the lands of snow and ice, catch a great many  walrus and seal, and eat a great deal of fat meat. You would not be well  unless you ate some fat or butter or oil.      WHAT WILL MAKE FAT?    Sugar will make fat, and so will starch, cream, rice, butter, and fat  meat. As milk will make muscle and fat and bones, it is the best kind of"]]]
