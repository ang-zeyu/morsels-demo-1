[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27995"],[0,"The History of London (#6)"],[1," when King Siebehrt died, they relapsed and drove  their Bishop into exile.    Then--Bede says that they were punished for this sin--the East Saxons  fell into trouble. They went to war with the men of Wessex and were  defeated by them. After this, we find London in the hands of the  Northumbrians and the Mercians--that is to say--these nations one after  the other obtained the supremacy. It was in the year 616 or thereabouts,  that Bishop Mellitus had to leave his diocese. Forty years later another  conversion of London took place under Bishop Cedd, consecrated at  Lindisfarne. The new faith was not strong enough to stand against a  plague, and the East Saxons of London went back once more to their old  gods. After another thirty years, before the close of the seventh  century, London was again converted: and this time for good.    In the eighth century London passed again out of the hands of the East  Saxon kings into those of the Mercians. The earliest extant document  concerning London is one dated 734, in which King Ethelbald grants to  the Bishop of Rochester leave to send one ship without tax in or out of  London Port.    A witan--i.e. a national council--was held in London in 811. It is then  spoken of as an illustrious place and royal city. The supremacy of  Mercia passed to that of Wessex--London went with the supremacy. In 833  Egbert, King of Wessex, held a witan in London.    [Illustration: MARTYRDOM OF ST. EDMUND BY THE DANES.    (_From a drawing belonging to the Society of Antiquaries._)]    When Egbert died the supremacy of Wessex fell with him. Then the Danish  troubles fell thick and disastrous upon the country. When Alfred  succeeded to the Crown the Danes held the Isle of Thanet, which  commanded the river; they had conquered the north country from the Tweed  to the Humber; they had overrun all the eastern counties twice--viz., in  839 and in 852: they had pillaged London, which they presently occupied,  making it their headquarters. With this Danish occupation ends the first  Saxon settlement of the City.          9. THE SECOND SAXON SETTLEMENT.      The Danes held the City for twelve years at least. One cannot believe  that these fierce warriors, who were exactly what the Saxons and Jutes  had been four hundred years before--as fierce, as rude, as  pagan--suffered any of the inhabitants, except the slaves, to remain.  Massacre and pillage--or the fear of both--drove away all the residents.  But the City was the headquarters of the Danes. Alfred recovered it in  the year 884.    He found it as the East Saxons had found it three hundred years before,  a city of ruins; the wall a ruin; the churches destroyed.    King Alfred has left many imperishable monuments of his reign. One of  the greatest is the City of London, which he rebuilt. A recent historian  (Loftie, _Historic Towns_, 'London') says that it would hardly be wrong  to write, 'London was founded, rather more than a thousand years ago, by  King Alfred--who chose for the site of his city a place formerly  fortified by the Romans but desolated successively by the Saxons and the  Danes.'    The first thing he did was to rebuild the wall. This work re-established  confidence in the minds of the citizens. Alfred placed his son-in-law  Ethelred, afterwards Alderman (i.e. Chief man--Governor) of the  Mercians, in command of the City, which seems to have been immediately  filled with people. The London citizens went out with Ethelred to defeat  the Danes at Benfleet, and with Alfred to defeat the Danes at the mouth  of the river Lea; they went out with Athelstan to fight at Brunanburgh.  London was never again taken by the Danes. Twice Sweyn endeavoured to  take the City but was repulsed. Nor did London open her gates to him  until the King had left the City. And when the Danes again entered the  City there was no more pillage or massacre; London was too strong to be  pillaged or massacred, and too rich to be abandoned to the army.    King Ethelred came back and died, and was buried in St. Paul's; the old  St. Paul's--that of King Ethelbert or that of Bishop Cedd--was burned  down and the Londoners were building a new cathedral.    Edmund Ironside was elected and crowned within the City walls. Then  followed a siege of London by Canute. He dug a canal through the swamps,  and dragged his ships by its means from Redriff to Lambeth. But he could  not take the City. But the Treaty of Partition between Edmund and  himself was agreed upon and the Dane once more obtained the City. He has  left one or two names behind him. The church of St. Olave's in Hart  Street, and that in 'Tooley,' or St. Olave's Street, Southwark, and the  Church of St. Magnus, attest to the sovereignty of the Dane.    [Illustration: SAXON HORSEMEN.    (_Harl. MS. 603._)]    At this time the two principal officers of the City were the Bishop and  the Portreeve: there was also the 'Staller' or Marshal. The principal  governing body was the 'Knighten Guild,' which was largely composed of  the City aldermen. But these aldermen were not like those of the present  day, an elected body: they were hereditary: they were aldermen in right  of their estates within the City. What powers the Knighten Guild  possessed is not easy to define. Besides this, the aristocracy of the  City, there were already trade guilds for religious purposes and for  feasting--but, as yet, with no powers. The people had their folk mote,  or general gathering: their ward mote: and their weekly hustings. We  must not seek to define the powers of all these bodies and corporations.  They overlapped each other: the aristocratic party was continually  innovating while the popular party as continually resisted. In many ways  what we call the government of the City had not begun to be understood.  That there was order of a kind is shown by the strict regulations, as  strictly enforced, of the dues and tolls for ships that came up the  river to the Port of London.          10. THE ANGLO-SAXON CITIZEN.      The Londoner of Athelstan and Ethelred was an Anglo-Saxon of a type far  in advance of his fierce ancestor who swept the narrow seas and harried  the eastern coasts. He had learned many arts: he had become a Christian:  he wanted many luxuries. But the solid things which he inherited from  his rude forefathers he passed on to his children. And they remain an  inheritance for us to this day. For instance, our form of monarchy,  limited in power, comes straight down to us from Alfred and Athelstan.  Our nobility is a survival and a development of the Saxon earls and  thanes; our forms of justice, trial by jury, magistrates--all come from  the Saxons; the divisions of our country are Saxon, our municipal  institutions are Saxon, our parliaments and councils are Saxon in  origin. We owe our language to the Anglo-Saxon, small additions from  Latin, French, and other sources have been made, but the bulk of our  language is Saxon. Three-fourths of us are Anglo-Saxon by descent.  Whatever there is in the English character of persistence, obstinacy,  patience, industry, sobriety, love of freedom, we are accustomed to  attribute to our Anglo-Saxon descent. In religion, arts, learning,  literature, culture, we owe little or nothing to the Anglo-Saxon. In all  these things we are indebted to the South.    Let us see how the Anglo-Saxon Londoner lived.    He was a trader or a craftsman. As a trader he received from the country  inland whatever it had to produce. Slaves, who were bred like cattle on  the farms, formed a large part of the exports; hides, wool, iron, tin,  the English merchant had these things, and nothing more, to offer the  foreigner who brought in exchange wine, spices, silk, incense, vestments  and pictures for the churches and monasteries, books, and other  luxuries. The ships at first belonged to the foreign merchants: they  traded not only at London, but also at Bristol, Canterbury, Dover,  Arundel, and other towns. Before the Conquest, however, English-built  ships and English-manned fleets had already entered upon the trade.    The trader, already wealthy, lived in great comfort. He was absolute  master in his own house, but the household was directed or ruled by his  wife. Everything was made in the house: the flour was ground, the bread  was baked, the meat and fish were salted; the linen was woven, the  garments were made by the wife, the daughters, and the women servants.  The Anglo-Saxon ladies were remarkable for their skill in embroidery;  they excelled all other women in this beautiful art.    The Anglo-Saxon house developed out of the common hall. Those who know  the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge can trace the growth of the house  in any of them. First there is the Common Hall. In this room, formerly,  the whole family, with the serving men and women, lived and slept. There  still exists at Higham Ferrars, in Northampton, such a hall, built as an  almshouse. It is a long room: at the east end, raised a foot, is a  little chapel; on the south side is a long open stove; the almsmen slept  on the floor on reeds, each man wrapped in his blanket.    [Illustration: SAXON CHURCH AT BRADFORD-ON-AVON, WILTS.]    Everybody lived and slept in the Common Hall. All day long the women  worked at the spinning and weaving and sewing and embroidery. Women were  defined by this kind of work--we still speak of spinsters. Formerly  relationship through the mother was called 'on the spindle side,' while,  long after the men had to fight every day against marauding tribes,  relationship through the father was called 'on the spear side.' All day  long the men worked outside in the fields, or in the warehouse, and on  the quays or at their craft. In the evening they sat about the fire and  listened to stories, or to songs with the accompaniment of the harp.    The first improvement was the separation of the kitchen from the hall:  in the Cambridge College you see the hall on one side and the kitchen  the other,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2800"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#6)"],[1,"the state of Arabia previous to the time of  Muhammad was one of preparedness for a new religion that the scattered  elements were there, and wanted only the mind of a master to harmonise and  enforce them and that Islam was, so to speak, a necessity of the time.15  Still Muhammad's career is a wonderful instance of the force and life that  resides in him who possesses an intense Faith in God and in the unseen world;  and whatever deductions may be made-and they are many and serious-from the  noble and truthful in his character, he will always be regarded as one of  those who have had that influence over the faith, morals, and whole earthly  life of their fellow-men, which none but a really great man ever did, or can,  exercise; and as one of those, whose efforts to propagate some great verity  will prosper, in spite of manifold personal errors and defects, both of  principle and character.    The more insight we obtain, from undoubted historical sources, into the  actual character of Muhammad, the less reason do we find to justify the  strong vituperative language poured out upon his head by Maracci, Prideaux,  and others, in recent days, one of whom has found, in the Byzantine  \"Maometis,\" the number of the Beast (Rev. xii)! It is nearer to the truth to  say that he was a great though imperfect character, an earnest though  mistaken teacher, and that many of his mistakes and imperfections were the  result of circumstances, of temperament, and constitution; and that there  must be elements both of truth and goodness in the system of which he was the  main author, to account for the world-wide phenomenon, that whatever may be  the intellectual inferiority (if such is, indeed, the fact) of the Muslim  races, the influence of his teaching, aided, it is true, by the vast impulse  given to it by the victorious arms of his followers, has now lasted for  nearly thirteen centuries, and embraces more than one hundred millions of our  race-more than one-tenth part of the inhabitants of the globe.    It must be acknowledged, too, that the Koran deserves the highest praise for  its conceptions of the Divine nature, in reference to the attributes of  Power, Knowledge, and universal Providence and Unity-that its belief and  trust in the One God of Heaven and Earth is deep and fervent-and that, though  it contains fantastic visions and legends, teaches a childish ceremonial, and  justifies bloodshedding, persecution, slavery, and polygamy, yet that at the  same time it embodies much of a noble and deep moral earnestness, and  sententious oracular wisdom, and has proved that there are elements in it on  which mighty nations, and conquering though not, perhaps, durable-empires can  be built up. It is due to the Koran, that the occupants in the sixth century  of an arid peninsula, whose poverty was only equalled by their ignorance,  become not only the fervent and sincere votaries of a new creed, but, like  Amru and many more, its warlike propagators. Impelled possibly by drought and  famine, actuated partly by desire of conquest, partly by religious  convictions, they had conquered Persia in the seventh century, the northern  coasts of Africa, and a large portion of Spain in the eighth, the Punjaub and  nearly the whole of India in the ninth. The simple shepherds and wandering  Bedouins of Arabia, are transformed, as if by a magician's wand, into the  founders of empires, the builders of cities, the collectors of more libraries  than they at first destroyed, while cities like Fostât, Baghdad, Cordova, and  Delhi, attest the power at which Christian Europe trembled. And thus, while  the Koran, which underlays this vast energy and contains the principles which  are its springs of action, reflects to a great extent the mixed character of  its author, its merits as a code of laws, and as a system of religious  teaching, must always be estimated by the changes which it introduced into  the customs and beliefs of those who willingly or by compulsion embraced it.  In the suppression of their idolatries, in the substitution of the worship of  Allah for that of the powers of nature and genii with Him, in the abolition  of child murder, in the extinction of manifold superstitious usages, in the  reduction of the number of wives to a fixed standard, it was to the Arabians  an unquestionable blessing, and an accession, though not in the Christian  sense a Revelation, of Truth; and while every Christian must deplore the  overthrow of so many flourishing Eastern churches by the arms of the  victorious Muslims, it must not be forgotten that Europe, in the middle ages,  owed much of her knowledge of dialectic philosophy, of medicine, and  architecture, to Arabian writers, and that Muslims formed the connecting link  between the West and the East for the importation of numerous articles of  luxury and use. That an immense mass of fable and silly legend has been built  up upon the basis of the Koran is beyond a doubt, but for this Muhammad is  not answerable, any more than he is for the wild and bloodthirsty excesses of  his followers in after ages. I agree with Sale in thinking that, \"how  criminal soever Muhammad may have been in imposing a false religion on  mankind, the praises due to his real virtues ought not to be denied him\"  (Preface), and venture to think that no one can rise from the perusal of his  Koran without argeeing with that motto from St. Augustin, which Sale has  prefixed to his title page, \"Nulla falsa doctrina est, quæ non aliquid veri  permisceat.\" Qust. Evang. ii. 40.    The Arabic text from which this translation has been made is that of Fluegel.  Leips. 1841. The translations of Sale, Ullmann, Wahl, Hammer von Purgstall in  the Fundgruben des Orients, and M. Kasimirski, have been collated throughout;  and above all, the great work of Father Maracci, to whose accuracy and  research search Sale's work mainly owes its merits. Sale has, however,  followed Maracci too closely, especially by introducing his paraphrastic  comments into the body of the text, as well as by his constant use of  Latinised instead of Saxon words. But to Sale's \"Preliminary Discourse\" the  reader is referred, as to a storehouse of valuable information; as well as to  the works of Geiger, Gerock, and Freytag, and to the lives of Muhammad by Dr.  Weil, Mr. Muir, and that of Dr. Sprenger now issuing from the press, in  German. The more brief and poetical verses of the earlier Suras are  translated with a freedom from which I have altogether abstained in the  historical and prosaic portions; but I have endeavoured nowhere to use a  greater amount of paraphrase than is necessary to convey the sense of the  original. \"Vel verbum e verbo,\" says S. Jerome (Præf. in Jobum) of versions,  \"vel sensum e sensu, vel ex utroque commixtum, et medie temperatum genus  translationis.\" The proper names are usually given as in our Scriptures: the  English reader would not easily recognise Noah as Nûh, Lot as Lût, Moses as  Musa, Abraham as Ibrahym, Pharaoh as Firaun, Aaron as Harun, Jesus as Isa,  John as Yahia, etc.; and it has been thought best to give different  renderings of the same constantly recurring words and phrases, in order more  fully to convey their meaning. For instance, the Arabic words which mean  Companions of the fire, are also rendered inmates of, etc., given up to,  etc.; the People of the Book, i.e. Jews, Christians and Sabeites, is  sometimes retained, sometimes paraphrased. This remark applies to such words  as tanzyl, lit. downsending or Revelation; zikr, the remembrance or constant  repetition or mention of God's name as an act of devotion; saha, the Hour of  present or final judgment; and various epithets of Allah.    I have nowhere attempted to represent the rhymes of the original. The  \"Proben\" of H. v. Purgstall, in the Fundgruben des Orients, excellent as they  are in many respects, shew that this can only be done with a sacrifice of  literal translation. I subjoin as a specimen Lieut. Burton's version of the  Fatthah, or opening chapter of previous editions. See Sura [viii.] p. 28.     1  In the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate!   2  Praise be to Allah, who the three worlds made.   3  The Merciful, the Compassionate,   4  The King of the day of Fate.   5  Thee alone do we worship, and of thee alone do we ask aid.   6  Guide us to the path that is straight-   7   The path of those to whom thy love is great,    Not those on whom is hate,    Nor they that deviate.  Amen.    \"I have endeavoured,\" he adds, \"in this translation to imitate the imperfect  rhyme of the original Arabic. Such an attempt, however, is full of  difficulties. The Arabic is a language in which, like Italian, it is almost  impossible not to rhyme.\" Pilgr. ii. 78.      1  Mishcât, vol. i. p. 524.  E. Trans. B. viii. 3, 3.    2  Mishcât, as above.
