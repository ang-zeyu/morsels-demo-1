This cover should work freely, and when  dropped down in place, should fill the opening neatly, leaving no cracks  for the captured animal to gnaw at.    [Illustration: Box Trap for Catching Animals Alive.]    Now nail two strips (CC) on opposite sides of the box and about three  inches from the mouth of the trap. These strips should extend about ten  inches above the top of the box, and should have the tops notched to  hold stick (D). Stick (E) is tied at one end to a nail driven in the end  of cover, and at the other end, is attached the trigger (F). One end of  this trigger fits into a notch cut into the end of the box, and the  other end fits into a similar notch cut in the bait-stick (G). The  bait-stick, as will be noticed in the drawing, is slipped through a hole  in the end of the box, just below the trigger notch, and is kept in  place by means of a nail driven through on the inside of the box. A  small trip board (H), rests under the bait-stick on the inside of the  trap. This trip board doubles the value of the trap, as by its use many  an animal which merely enters the trap to smell at the bait, will be  caught; which would not occur if the board were not used.    To complete the trap, a snap catch (I) is fastened to one side of the  trap in front of upright strip (C) and its purpose is to catch and hold  the cover when the trap is sprung. This snap is made of springy wood,  beveled on the top, and the falling cover presses it outward; but as  soon as the trap is fully closed, it springs back to the original  position holding the cover securely. In making this trap it is  advisable, always, to use old, weather-beaten lumber.    As a result of my investigation, I made a number of these traps and was  successful with them, from the start. In that part of the country there  had been many saw-mills and logging camps, at one time or another and at  such places I could always find old boards from which to construct the  traps. The only tools required being a saw, a hatchet, and a half-inch  auger, I would go to these places during the summer, whenever I had a  day to spare, and make a few traps, hiding them near the places where I  wished to set them.    The trap described above is of the size used for mink, skunk and  opossum, but I made most of mine on a larger scale, and by baiting with  fish, I caught many coons. On one occasion I caught three coons in one  night, with only three traps set, and in another trap, set by the side  of a small stream, in a gap of the mountains, I caught three mink and  two coons in one fall season. At another time I caught a large bob-cat  in such a trap.    As I said before I baited with fish when I could get them; but those  trappers who used them for mink alone, never used bait, but attracted  the mink into the trap by means of mink musk rubbed on the trip board.    I caught quite a lot of skunks in box traps, and it is a nice way to  catch these animals, for the trap may be carried to the nearest water  and the catch drowned by holding the trap beneath the surface. It is  advisable always, to place a weight--a few stones or wet chunks--on the  cover, as this will make it more certain in its action.    These traps are specially suitable for catching animals alive and  uninjured, for breeding purposes, and now, that so many people are  interested in raising fur-bearing animals, there is a ready sale for  live animals, and this matter should be given attention.    [Illustration: Box Trap with Swing Gate.]    I have used another style of box-trap for muskrats, but is not intended  for catching the animals alive, and the muskrats are always drowned. It  is a simple box or square tube of boards, 6 x 6 x 24 or 26 inches, open  at both ends. A wire screen is fastened over one end, and a loosely  hinged gate of pointed wires is hung in the other end. I used for the  gate, pieces of umbrella ribs, cut about eight inches long and the ends  filed sharp. With the wires cut this length the gate will hang at an  angle of forty-five degrees, or more, and will push in easily, allowing  the animal to enter the trap without effort; but once inside, escape is  impossible, as the gate cannot be pushed out, and even if the captured  animal should raise the gate and attempt to creep under it, the pointed  wires will catch in its back and prevent escape.    They are set in the dens, under water, and if the mouth of the den is  too large, the space around the trap should be closed with sods. Set in  this way, it will catch any muskrat that attempts to leave the den, and  I have caught three at one time in such a trap.    While muskrats caught in this way are always drowned, other animals,  such as: mink, skunk and opossum, may be taken alive by setting the trap  in the mouth of the den, blocking up all side openings. The width of the  trap as shown in the cut, is considerably out of proportion, when  compared with its length--it being drawn this way to show more clearly  the working of the swing gate.    A very effective skunk trap may be made from an old barrel. The barrel  is pivoted to a pair of stakes, driven firmly into the ground along a  bank or hillside, where skunks are found, and the bait is fastened on  the bottom of the inside of the barrel. This trap is shown plainly in  the illustration. It will be apparent to all that when the skunk, in  approaching the bait, passes the center, where it is hinged to the  stakes, the barrel tips over, and it will be impossible for the animal  to escape.    Muskrats are sometimes taken with a wire net. To hunt them successfully  in this way, two persons are required. While one holds the net over the  mouth of the den, the other hunter drives the inmates from the burrow by  prodding the ground with a pointed pole. A wire cage with a cover must  be used to carry the captured animals, and each individual must be  shaken into the cage as soon as captured, and the cage closed  immediately to prevent their escape.    [Illustration: Barrel Trap for Catching Animals Alive.]    When box traps are used, no difficulty whatever will be encountered in  transporting the animals, as trap and catch may be carried into the  enclosure before the animal is liberated. Even the skunk may be carried  along in this way without any danger of scenting. The trap should be  handled carefully--not thrown about.    Muskrats may be handled with perfect safety if grasped by the end of the  tail and held at arm's length.    Trappers, as a rule, know just what time of year the young of each  species of animal are born and I would advise, when trapping animals for  breeding purposes, to catch them before this time, or at such a length  of time after the birth of the young, that there will be no danger of  their starving in case they are not captured along with the mother. Even  if the very young animals are taken from the den, there is danger of  them suffering from careless handling, or from not receiving proper  care. It is better to catch the female animals before the young are  born.           *       *       *       *       *    Another box trap that is a good one, is described by an Illinois trapper  as follows:    \"I here enclose a sketch for making a trap for catching mink which I  have used for years, and think it can't be beat. Make a box 22 inches  long, 5 inches wide, and 6 inches high out of inch lumber; bore a hole  at the back for the string (D) to pass through, which is tied to a bait  at (E) and fastened at the other end to a heavy wire (C), on top of the  box, which holds the sliding door (A), when set. A couple of strips (B)  are nailed on each side to hold the door in place. This is a good trap  for mink that are afraid of steel traps. For bait use a rabbit's head  tied securely to the string, also a few drops of good scent put on the  bait, and set near the mouth of some tiles or wherever mink abound.\"    [Illustration: Another Box Trap.]    This trap, as well as all the box-traps in this chapter, are recommended  for catching such animals as skunk, coon, mink, and opossum, alive and  uninjured, for stocking \"fur-farms.\"    Muskrat can be caught in these traps by baiting and setting where they  feed, or on runways from one pond to another.    Animals caught in these traps can be carried with safety to both catcher  and animal, to the enclosure, before taking out of the trap.          CHAPTER V.    FOX RAISING.      The foxes of North America are divided by naturalists into only three  distinct groups or species, namely, the red, the gray and the Arctic  foxes. Of these, the red species is divided into a number of varieties,  among which are the Nova Scotia Red Fox, the Newfoundland Red Fox and  the Western Kit or Swift Fox, etc.    The black, cross and silver foxes are commonly supposed to be only color  varieties of the red, there being no difference whatever, except in the  fur. While naturalists all agree on this subject there is considerable  difference of opinion among others who give as proof that they are of a  different species, the fact that the black, cross and silver are only  found in the northern districts while the red variety is found well down  into the south. There are, however, certain facts which go to prove that  they are all of the same variety or if different that they interbreed,  the most convincing of these being the fact that the various colors are  sometimes found in the same litter. But, be this as it may, the matter  is of little importance to the prospective fox breeder as it has become  a well known fact that the red color can be entirely eliminated by  careful breeding.    The red fox is found throughout the greater part of Canada and the  United States except in the far south where it is replaced by the gray  species "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33852"],[0,"British Butterflies: Figures and Descriptions of Every Native Species (#6)"],[1,"I have seen  some exhibit symptoms of the greatest terror at the proximity of a large  Hawk-moth, and some of the thick-bodied common moths--\"Match-owlets,\" the  country folk call them.    Once, also, I listened to the grave recital--by a classical scholar too--of  a murderous onslaught made by a Privet Hawk-moth on the neck of a lady, and  how it \"_bit a piece clean out_.\" Of course I attempted to prove, by what  seemed to me very fair logic, that the {33} moth, having neither teeth nor  even any mouth capable of opening, but only a weak hollow tongue to suck  honey through, was utterly incapable of biting or inflicting any wound  whatever. But, as is usual in such cases, my entomological theory went for  nothing in face of the gentleman's knock-down battery of _facts_--_ocular_  facts; he had _seen_ the _moth_, and he had _seen_ the _wound_: surely,  there was proof enough for me, or any one else. So, I suppose, he  steadfastly believes to this day, that the moth was a truculent,  bloodthirsty monster; whilst I still presume to believe, that if any wound  was caused at the moment in question, it was by the nails of the lady  attacked, or her friends, in clutching frantically at the terrific  intruder; who, poor fellow, might have been pardoned for mistaking the fair  neck for one of his favourite flowers (a _lily_, perhaps), while the utmost  harm he contemplated was to pilfer a sip of nectar from the lips he  doubtless took for rosebuds.    Utilitarians may, perhaps, inquire the _uses_ of butterflies--what they do,  make, or can be sold for; and I must confess that my little favourites  neither make anything to wear, like the silkworm, nor anything to eat, like  the honey-bee, nor are their bodies saleable by the ton, like the cochineal  insects, and that, commercially speaking, they are just worth nothing at  all, excepting the few paltry pence or shillings that the dealer gets for  their little dried bodies occasionally; so they are of no more use than  poetry, painting, and music--than flowers, rainbows, and all such {34}  unbusinesslike things. In fact, I have nothing to say in the butterfly's  favour, except that it is a joy to the deep-minded and to the  simple-hearted, to the sage, and, still better, to the child--that it gives  an earnest of a better world, not vaguely and generally, as does every  \"thing of beauty,\" but with clearest aim and purpose, through one of the  most strikingly perfect and beautiful analogies that we can find throughout  that vast Creation, where--     \"All animals are living hieroglyphs.\"[5]    The butterfly, then, in its own progressive stages of caterpillar,  chrysalis, and perfect insect, is an emblem of the human soul's progress  through earthly life and death, to heavenly life.    Even the ancient Greeks, with their imperfect lights, recognised this  truth, when they gave the same name, Psyche ([Greek: Psuche]), to the soul,  or spirit of life, and to the butterfly, and sculptured over the effigy of  one dead the figure of a butterfly, floating away, as it were, in his  breath; while poets of all nations have since followed up the simile.    And this analogy is not only a mere general resemblance, but holds good  through its minute details to a marvellous extent; to trace which fully  would require volumes, while in this place the slightest sketch only can be  given.    First, there is the grovelling caterpillar-state, {35} emblematical of our  present imperfection, but yet the state of preparation and increase towards  perfection, and that, too, which largely influences the future existence.    Many troubles and changes are the lot of the caterpillar. Repeated  skin-shiftings and ceaseless industry in his vocation are necessary, that  within his set time he may attain full growth and vigour.    Then comes a mighty change: the caterpillar is to exchange his worm-like  form and nature for an existence unspeakably higher and better. But, as we  have seen, to arrive at this glory there is only one condition, which is,  that the creature must pass through another, and, as it might seem, a  gloomy state--one anything but cheerful to contemplate; for it must cease  to eat, to move, and--_to the eye_--_to live_. Yet, is it really dead now,  or do we, who have watched the creature thus far, despair and call it lost?  Do we not rather rejoice that it rests from its labours, and that the  period of its glorification is at hand?    In the silent chrysalis state then our _Psyche_ sleeps away awhile,  unaffected by the vicissitudes around it; and, at last, when its appointed  day arrives, bursts from its cerements, and rises in the air a winged and  joyous being, to meet the sun which warmed it into new life. Now it is a  _butterfly_,--bright emblem of pleasure unalloyed.    This happy consummation, however, is only for the chrysalis which has not  within it the devouring worm, the fruit of the ichneumon's egg, harboured  during the {36} caterpillar state--and emblem, in the human soul, of some  deadly sin yielded to during life, and which afterwards becomes the gnawing  \"worm that dieth not.\" For in this case, instead of the bright butterfly,  there issues forth from the chrysalis-shell only a swarm of black,  ill-favoured flies, like a troop of evil spirits coming from their feast on  a fallen soul.    If a caterpillar were gifted with a foreknowledge of his butterfly future,  so far transcending his inglorious present, we could imagine that he would  be only impatient to get through his caterpillar duties, and rejoice to  enter the chrysalis state as soon as he was fitted for it. How  short-sighted then would a caterpillar appear who should endeavour, while  in that shape, to emulate the splendour of the butterfly by some wretched  temporary substitute, adding a few more, or brighter stripes than nature  had given it; or, again, if one whose great change was drawing near, should  attempt to conceal its visible approach by painting over the fading hues of  health, and plastering up the wrinkles of its outward covering, so soon to  be thrown off altogether; instead of striving for inward strength and  beauty, which would never decline, but be infinitely expanded in the  butterfly--and regarding the earthly beauty's wane as the dawn of the  celestial.    [Illustration: VI.]    {37} With these and similar reflections before us (which might be  multiplied _ad infinitum_), we shall no longer look upon the caterpillar as  a mere unsightly and troublesome reptile, the chrysalis as an  unintelligible curiosity, and the butterfly as a pretty painted thing and  nothing more; but regard them as _together_ forming one of those beautiful  and striking illustrations with which the book of Nature has been so  profusely enriched by its GREAT AUTHOR; not to be taken as _substitutes_  for His revealed Word, but as harmonious adjuncts, bringing its great  truths more home to our understandings, just as the engravings in a book  are not designed as substitutes for the text, but to elucidate and  strengthen the ideas in the reader's mind.    While the poet draws from the butterfly many a pleasant similitude, and the  moralist many a solemn teaching, the artist (who should be poet and  moralist too) dwells upon these beings with fondest delight, finding in  them images of joy and life when seen at large in the landscape, and rich  stores of colour-lessons when studied at home in the cabinet.    The owners of many a name great in the arts have been enthusiastic  collectors of butterflies. Our distinguished countryman, Thomas Stothard,  was one of their devotees, and the following anecdote, extracted from his  published life, shows how he was led to make them his special study:--    \"He was beginning to paint the figure of a reclining sylph, when a  difficulty arose in his own mind how best to represent such a being of  fancy. A friend who was present said, 'Give the sylph a butterfly's wing,  and then you have it.' 'That I will,' exclaimed Stothard; 'and to be  correct I will paint the wing {38} from the butterfly itself.' He sallied  forth, extended his walk to the fields, some miles distant, and caught one  of those beautiful insects; it was of the species called the Peacock. Our  artist brought it carefully home, and commenced sketching it, but not in  the painting room; and leaving it on the table, a servant swept the pretty  little creature away, before its portrait was finished. On learning his  loss, away went Stothard once more to the fields to seek another butterfly.  But at this time one of the tortoise-shell tribe crossed his path, and was  secured. He was astonished at the combination of colour that presented  itself to him in this small but exquisite work of the Creator, and from  that moment determined to enter on a new and difficult field--the study of  the insect department of Natural History. He became a hunter of  butterflies. The more he caught, the greater beauty did he trace in their  infinite variety, and he would often say that no one knew what he owed to  these insects--they had taught him the finest combinations in that  difficult branch of art--colouring.\"    The above doubtless has its parallel in the experience of many artistic  minds, whose very nature it is to appreciate to the full the perfections  set forth in a butterfly, admiring--     \"The velvet nap which on his wings doth lie,    The silken down with which his back is dight,    His broad outstretched horns, his airy thigh,    His glorious colours and his glistening eye.\"                                  SPENSER.           *       *       *       *       *      {39}    CHAPTER IV.
