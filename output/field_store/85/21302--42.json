A striking figure was Beowulf as he  stood there in his gleaming ring-mail, with the mighty sword by his  side. It was, however, but a minute that Hrothgar looked in silence,  for with respectful greeting Beowulf spoke:        \"Hail to thee, Hrothgar King!    Beowulf am I,      Hygelac's kinsman    and loyal companion.      Great deeds of valour    wrought I in my youth.      To me in my native land    Grendel's ill-doing      Came as an oft-heard tale    told by our sailors.      They say that this bright hall,    noblest of buildings,      Standeth to every man    idle and useless      After the evening-light    fails in the heavens.      Thus, Hrothgar, ancient king,    all my friends urged me,      Warriors and prudent thanes,    that I should seek thee,      Since they themselves had known    my might in battle.      Now I will beg of thee,    lord of the glorious Danes,      Prince of the Scylding race,    Folk-lord most friendly,      Warden of warriors,    only one boon.      Do not deny it me,    since I have come from far;      I with my men alone,    this troop of heroes good,      Would without help from thee    cleanse thy great hall!      Oft have I also heard    that the fierce monster      Through his mad recklessness    scorns to use weapons;      Therefore will I forego    (so may King Hygelac,      My friendly lord and king,    find in me pleasure)      That I should bear my sword    and my broad yellow shield      Into the conflict:    with my hand-grip alone      I 'gainst the foe will strive,    and struggle for my life--      He shall endure God's doom    whom death shall bear away.      I know that he thinketh    in this hall of conflict      Fearless to eat me,    if he can compass it,      As he has oft devoured    heroes of Denmark.      Then thou wilt not need    my head to hide away,      Grendel will have me    all mangled and gory;      Away will he carry,    if death then shall take me,      My body with gore stained    will he think to feast on,      On his lone track will bear it    and joyously eat it,      And mark with my life-blood    his lair in the moorland;      Nor more for my welfare    wilt thou need to care then.      Send thou to Hygelac,    if strife shall take me,      That best of byrnies    which my breast guardeth,      Brightest of war-weeds,    the work of Smith Weland,      Left me by Hrethel.    Ever Wyrd has her way.\"    The aged King Hrothgar, who had listened attentively while the hero  spoke of his plans and of his possible fate, now greeted him saying:  \"Thou hast sought my court for honour and for friendship's sake, O  Beowulf: thou hast remembered the ancient alliance between Ecgtheow,  thy father, and myself, when I shielded him, a fugitive, from the  wrath of the Wilfings, paid them the due wergild for his crime, and  took his oath of loyalty to myself. Long ago that time is; Ecgtheow is  dead, and I am old and in misery. It were too long now to tell of all  the woe that Grendel has wrought, but this I may say, that many a  hero has boasted of the great valour he would display in strife with  the monster, and has awaited his coming in this hall; in the morning  there has been no trace of each hero but the dark blood-stains on  benches and tables. How many times has that happened! But sit down now  to the banquet and tell thy plans, if such be thy will.\"    Thereupon room was made for the Geat warriors on the long benches, and  Beowulf sat in the place of honour opposite to the king: great respect  was shown to him, and all men looked with wonder on this mighty hero,  whose courage led him to hazard this terrible combat. Great carved  horns of ale were borne to Beowulf and his men, savoury meat was  placed before them, and while they ate and drank the minstrels played  and sang to the harp the deeds of men of old. The mirth of the feast  was redoubled now men hoped that a deliverer had come indeed.      The Quarrel    Among all the Danes who were rejoicing over Beowulf's coming there was  one whose heart was sad and his brow gloomy--one thane whom jealousy  urged to hate any man more distinguished than himself. Hunferth, King  Hrothgar's orator and speech-maker, from his official post at  Hrothgar's feet watched Beowulf with scornful and jealous eyes. He  waited until a pause came in the clamour of the feast, and suddenly  spoke, coldly and contemptuously: \"Art thou that Beowulf who strove  against Breca, the son of Beanstan, when ye two held a swimming  contest in the ocean and risked your lives in the deep waters? In vain  all your friends urged you to forbear--ye would go on the hazardous  journey; ye plunged in, buffeting the wintry waves through the  rising storm. Seven days and nights ye toiled, but Breca overcame  thee: he had greater strength and courage. Him the ocean bore to  shore, and thence he sought his native land, and the fair city where  he ruled as lord and chieftain. Fully he performed his boast against  thee. So I now look for a worse issue for thee, for thou wilt find  Grendel fiercer in battle than was Breca, if thou darest await him  this night.\"    Beowulf's brow flushed with anger as he replied haughtily: \"Much hast  thou spoken, friend Hunferth, concerning Breca and our swimming  contest; but belike thou art drunken, for wrongly hast thou told the  tale. A youthful folly of ours it was, when we two boasted and  challenged each other to risk our lives in the ocean; that indeed we  did. Naked swords we bore in our hands as we swam, to defend ourselves  against the sea-monsters, and we floated together, neither  outdistancing the other, for five days, when a storm drove us apart.  Cold were the surging waves, bitter the north wind, rough was the  swelling flood, under the darkening shades of night. Yet this was not  the worst: the sea-monsters, excited by the raging tempest, rushed at  me with their deadly tusks and bore me to the abyss. Well was it then  for me that I wore my well-woven ring-mail, and had my keen sword in  hand; with point and edge I fought the deadly beasts, and killed them.  Many a time the hosts of monsters bore me to the ocean-bottom, but I  slew numbers among them, and thus we battled all the night, until in  the morning came light from the east, and I could see the windy cliffs  along the shore, and the bodies of the slain sea-beasts floating on  the surge. Nine there were of them, for Wyrd is gracious to the man  who is valiant and unafraid. Never have I heard of a sterner  conflict, nor a more unhappy warrior lost in the waters; yet I saved  my life, and landed on the shores of Finland. Breca wrought not so  mightily as I, nor have I heard of such warlike deeds on thy part,  even though thou, O Hunferth, didst murder thy brothers and nearest  kinsmen.        \"Truly I say to thee,    O son of Ecglaf bold,      Grendel the grisly fiend    ne'er dared have wrought      So many miseries,    such shame and anguish dire,      To thy lord, Hrothgar old,    in his bright Heorot,      Hadst thou shown valiant mood,    sturdy and battle-fierce,      As thou now boastest.\"    [Illustration: Beowulf replies haughtily to Hunferth]    Very wroth was Hunferth over the reminder of his former wrongdoing and  the implied accusation of cowardice, but he had brought it on himself  by his unwise belittling of Beowulf's feat, and the applause of both  Danes and Geats showed him that he dared no further attack the  champion; he had to endure in silence Beowulf's boast that he and his  Geats would that night await Grendel in the hall, and surprise him  terribly, since the fiend had ceased to expect any resistance from the  warlike Danes. The feast continued, with laughter and melody, with  song and boast, until the door from the women's bower, in the upper  end of the hall, opened suddenly, and Hrothgar's wife, the fair and  gracious Queen Wealhtheow, entered. The tumult lulled for a short  space, and the queen, pouring mead into a goblet, presented it to her  husband; joyfully he received and drank it. Then she poured mead or  ale for each man, and in due course came to Beowulf, as to the guest  of honour. Gratefully Wealhtheow greeted the lordly hero, and thanked  him for the friendship which brought him to Denmark to risk his life  against Grendel. Beowulf, rising respectfully and taking the cup from  the queen's hand, said with dignity:        \"This I considered well    when I the ocean sought,      Sailed in the sea-vessel    with my brave warriors,      That I alone would win    thy folk's deliverance,      Or in the fight would fall    fast in the demon's grip.      Needs must I now perform    knightly deeds in this hall,      Or here must meet my doom    in darksome night.\"    Well pleased, Queen Wealhtheow went to sit beside her lord, where her  gracious smile cheered the assembly. Then the clamour of the feast was  renewed, until Hrothgar at length gave the signal for retiring.  Indeed, it was necessary to leave Heorot when darkness fell, for the  fiend came each night when sunlight faded. So the whole assembly  arose, each man bade his comrades \"Good night,\" and the Danes  dispersed; but Hrothgar addressed Beowulf half joyfully, half sadly,  saying:        \"Never before have I    since I held spear and shield      Given o'er to any man    this mighty Danish hall,      Save now to thee alone.    Keep thou and well defend      This best of banquet-halls.    Show forth thy hero-strength,      Call up thy bravery,    watch for the enemy!      Thou shalt not lack gifts of worth    if thou alive remain      Winner in this dire strife.\"    Thus Hrothgar departed, to seek slumber in a less dangerous abode,  where, greatly troubled in mind, he awaited the dawn with almost  hopeless expectation, and Beowulf and his men prepared themselves for  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25529"],[0,"The Adventures of Danny Meadow Mouse (#6)"],[1,"around each of the young peach trees.  Peter grew so curious that he forgot all about his troubles and  how far away from home he was. He could hardly wait for night to  come so that he might see what they had been doing.    Just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun started to go to bed behind the  Purple Hills, Farmer Brown and his boy started back to the  house. Farmer Brown was smiling now.    \"I guess that will fix him!\" he said.    \"Now what does he mean by that?\" thought Peter. \"Whom will it  fix? Can it be me? I don't need any fixing.\"    [Illustration: _All around the trunk of the tree was wrapped wire  netting_]    He waited just as long as he could. When all was still, and the  moonlight had begun to make shadows of the trees on the snow,  Peter very cautiously crept out of his hiding place. Bowser the  Hound was nowhere in sight, and everything was as quiet and  peaceful as it had been when he first came into the orchard the  night before. Peter had fully made up his mind to go straight  home as fast as his long legs would take him, but his dreadful  curiosity insisted that first he must find out what Farmer Brown  and his boy had been doing to the young peach trees.    So Peter hurried over to the nearest tree. All around the trunk  of the tree, from the ground clear up higher than Peter could  reach, was wrapped wire netting. Peter couldn't get so much as a  nibble of the delicious bark. He hadn't intended to take any, for  he had meant to go right straight home, but now that he couldn't  get any, he wanted some more than ever--just a bite. Peter looked  around. Everything was quiet. He would try the next tree, and  then he would go home.    But the next tree was wrapped with wire. Peter hesitated, looked  around, turned to go home, thought of how good that bark had  tasted the night before, hesitated again, and then hurried over  to the third tree. It was protected just like the others. Then  Peter forgot all about going home. He wanted some of that  delicious bark, and he ran from one tree to another as fast as he  could go.    At last, way down at the end of the orchard, Peter found a tree  that had no wire around it. \"They must have forgotten this one!\"  he thought, and his eyes sparkled. All around on the snow were a  lot of shiny little wires, but Peter didn't notice them. All he  saw was that delicious bark on the young peach tree. He hopped  right into the middle of the wires, and then, just as he reached  up to take the first bite of bark, he felt something tugging at  one of his hind legs.                                       XV                  Peter Rabbit Is Caught in a Snare      When Peter Rabbit, reaching up to nibble the bark of one of  Farmer Brown's young trees, felt something tugging at one of his  hind legs, he was so startled that he jumped to get away. Instead  of doing this, he fell flat on his face. The thing on his hind  leg had tightened and held him fast. A great fear came to Peter  Rabbit, and lying there in the snow, he kicked and struggled  with all his might. But the more he kicked, the tighter grew that  hateful thing on his leg! Finally he grew too tired to kick any  more and lay still. The dreadful thing that held him hurt his  leg, but it didn't pull when he lay still.    When he had grown a little calmer, Peter sat up to examine the  thing which held him so fast. It was something like one of the  blackberry vines he had sometimes tripped over, only it was  bright and shiny, and had no branches or tiny prickers, and one  end was fastened to a stake. Peter tried to bite off the shiny  thing, but even his great, sharp front teeth couldn't cut it.  Then Peter knew what it was. It was wire! It was a snare which  Farmer Brown had set to catch him, and which he had walked right  into because he had been so greedy for the bark of the young  peach tree that he had not used his eyes to look out for danger.    Oh, how Peter Rabbit did wish that he had not been so curious to  know what Farmer Brown had been doing that day, and that he had  gone straight home as he had meant to do, instead of trying to  get one more meal of young peach bark! Big tears rolled down  Peter's cheeks. What should he do? What could he do? For a long  time Peter sat in the moonlight, trying to think of something to  do. At last he thought of the stake to which that hateful wire  was fastened. The stake was of wood, and Peter's teeth would cut  wood. Peter's heart gave a great leap of hope, and he began at  once to dig away the snow from around the stake, and then settled  himself to gnaw the stake in two.    Peter had been hard at work on the stake a long time and had it a  little more than half cut through, when he heard a loud sniff  down at the other end of the orchard. He looked up to see--whom  do you think? Why, Bowser the Hound! He hadn't seen Peter yet,  but he had already found Peter's tracks, and it would be but a  few minutes before he found Peter himself.    Poor Peter Rabbit! There wasn't time to finish cutting off the  stake. What could he do? He made a frightened jump just as he had  when he first felt the wire tugging at his leg. Just as before,  he was thrown flat on his face. He scrambled to his feet and  jumped again, only to be thrown just as before. Just then Bowser  the Hound saw him and opening his mouth sent forth a great roar.  Peter made one more frantic jump. Snap! The stake had broken!  Peter pitched forward on his head, turned a somersault, and  scrambled to his feet. He was free at last! That is, he could  run, but after him dragged a piece of the stake.    How Peter did run! It was hard work, for you know he had to drag  that piece of stake after him. But he did it, and just in time he  crawled into the old stone wall on one side of the orchard, while  Bowser the Hound barked his disappointment to the moon.                                       XVI                     Peter Rabbit's Hard Journey      Peter Rabbit sat in the old stone wall along one side of Farmer  Brown's orchard, waiting for Mrs. Moon to put out her light and  leave the world in darkness until jolly, round, red Mr. Sun  should kick off his rosy bed-clothes and begin his daily climb up  in the blue, blue sky. In the winter, Mr. Sun is a late sleeper,  and Peter knew that there would be two or three hours after Mrs.  Moon put out her light when it would be quite dark. And Peter  also knew that by this time Hooty the Owl would probably have  caught his dinner. So would old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox. Bowser  the Hound would be too sleepy to be on the watch. It would be the  very safest time for Peter to try to get to his home in the dear  Old Briar-patch.    So Peter waited and waited. Twice Bowser the Hound, who had  chased him into the old wall, came over and barked at him and  tried to get at him. But the old wall kept Peter safe, and  Bowser gave it up. And all the time Peter sat waiting he was in  great pain. You see, that shiny wire was drawn so tight that it  cut into his flesh and hurt dreadfully, and to the other end of  the wire was fastened a piece of wood, part of the stake to which  the snare had been made fast and which Peter had managed to gnaw  and break off.    It was on account of this that Peter was waiting for Mrs. Moon to  put out her light. He knew that with that stake dragging after  him he would have to go very slowly, and he could not run any  more risk of danger than he actually had to. So he waited and  waited, and by and by, sure enough, Mrs. Moon put out her light.  Peter waited a little longer, listening with all his might.  Everything was still. Then Peter crept out of the old stone wall.    Right away trouble began. The stake dragging at the end of the  wire fast to his leg caught among the stones and pulled Peter up  short. My, how it did hurt! It made the tears come. But Peter  shut his teeth hard, and turning back, he worked until he got the  stake free. Then he started on once more, dragging the stake  after him.    Very slowly across the orchard and under the fence on the other  side crept Peter Rabbit, his leg so stiff and sore that he could  hardly touch it to the snow, and all the time dragging that piece  of stake, which seemed to grow heavier and harder to drag every  minute. Peter did not dare to go out across the open fields, for  fear some danger might happen along, and he would have no place  to hide. So he crept along close to the fences where bushes grow,  and this made it very, very hard, for the dragging stake was  forever catching in the bushes with a yank at the sore leg which  brought Peter up short with a squeal of pain.    This was bad enough, but all the time Peter was filled with a  dreadful fear that Hooty the Owl or Granny Fox might just happen  along. He had to stop to rest very, very often, and then he would  listen and listen. Over and over again he said to himself:    \"Oh dear, whatever did I go up to the young peach orchard for  when I knew I had no business there? Why couldn't I have been  content with all the good things that were mine in the Green  Forest and on the Green Meadows? Oh dear! Oh dear!\"    Just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun began to light up the Green  Meadows, Peter Rabbit reached the dear Old Briar-patch. Danny  Meadow Mouse was sitting on the edge of it anxiously watching for  him. Peter crawled up and started to creep in along one of his  little private paths. He got in himself, but the dragging stake  caught among the brambles, and Peter just fell down in the snow  right where he was, too tired and worn out to move.    [Illustration]                                      XVII                 Danny Meadow Mouse Becomes Worried      Danny Meadow Mouse limped around through the dear Old  Briar-patch, where he had lived with Peter Rabbit ever since he  had squirmed out of the claws of Hooty the Owl and dropped there,  right at the feet of Peter Rabbit. Danny limped because he was  still lame and sore from Hooty's terrible"]]]
