Lastly,        fold in the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in a quick oven        for thirty minutes.    {Footer: The high price of butter has no terror for users of Swift's  Premium Oleomargarine.}      Beefsteak Pie    Use the Flank Steak (7) or Round (5)      2 pounds uncooked meat cut in inch cubes    1 cupful flour    1 tablespoonful parsley chopped fine    1/4 pound suet freed of membrane and chopped fine    1 onion chopped fine    1 cupful Swift's beef extract or stock boiling hot    1 teaspoonful salt    1/4 teaspoonful pepper      Put meat in deep pudding-dish and sprinkle over it parsley, onion,        salt and pepper.      To the suet add the flour, a pinch of salt, and sufficient ice water        to moisten, but not to make wet. Knead a little until it can be        rolled out in a crust large enough to cover the top of the        pudding-dish.      Pour the boiling stock over the meat. Spread the crust over it and cut        a slit in the top. Brush over with milk and bake in a moderate        oven one and a quarter hours.      Serve in same dish with a napkin folded around it.      Braised Beef    Use inch thick slice from Under Round (5)      1/2 cupful onion chopped    1/2 cupful carrot cut in dice    1/2 cupful turnip cut in dice    1/2 cupful celery cut in 1/2-inch lengths    1 stem parsley    6 peppercorns    3 cloves    1 bay-leaf    1 teaspoonful salt    4 cupfuls Swift's beef extract      Rub the slice of meat with flour. Have ready bacon or pork fat very        hot in frying-pan. Lay in the meat and brown quickly on both        sides.      Spread the seasonings and vegetables over the bottom of a baking-pan.        Lay the browned meat upon them; add the Swift's beef extract;        cover, and bake three hours in very slow oven, basting every        fifteen minutes.      To serve, lay meat in center of the platter. Place vegetables around        it. Make a brown sauce with the liquor left in pan and pour over        the vegetables.    {Footer: Use Swift's Premium Oleomargarine on your table and for  cooking.}      Brown Beef Stew with Dumplings    Use Bony End Shoulder (10) or Veiny Piece (lower 3)      2 pounds uncooked beef cut in inch cubes    2 tablespoonfuls flour    1 teaspoonful kitchen bouquet    1 small carrot cut in dice    1/4 teaspoonful pepper    1 teaspoonful salt    2 ounces of suet    2 cupfuls Swift's Beef Extract or of stock    1 onion    1 bay-leaf      Roll the meat cubes in one tablespoonful of the flour. Put suet in        frying-pan and shake over fire until melted. Remove the        crackling, put in the meat cubes and turn till they are slightly        browned on all sides. Remove the meat.      Into the fat in the pan stir the second tablespoonful of flour; mix        and add gradually the stock, stirring all the while so there will        be no lumps. When smooth, return the meat to the pan, add the        vegetables and seasonings. Cover the pan, draw to the back of the        coal range, or reduce the flame of the gas so that the stew will        not boil, and let it simmer for one and one-half hours.      Ten minutes before serving make the    Dumplings      2 cupfuls flour    1 rounding teaspoonful baking-powder    1/2 level teaspoonful salt    2/3 cupful milk      Sift flour, baking-powder, and salt together. Add the milk. Take to        fire and drop the mixture by spoonfuls all over the stew. Cover        and cook slowly for ten minutes without once removing the cover.      To serve, lift the dumplings carefully and lay around the edge of the        platter; place stew in the center, and over it pour the sauce.    {Footer: Wherever butter is specified in a recipe use a slightly smaller  quantity of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine, it costs less and is just as  good.}      Timetable for Baking      Beans (if prepared by soaking and boiling), 3 to 4 hrs.

The chemical  bonds of this phosphorus in the molecules of nucleic substances were  determined in later work. (_Photo courtesy National Library of Medicine,  Washington, D.C._)]    From these findings, together with what Oswald Schmiedeberg (1838-1921)  had established concerning the presence of four phosphate groups in the  molecule (1899), Robert Feulgen (1884-1955) constructed the following  scheme of a nucleic acid. Feulgen's formula of 1918 is:        Phosphoric acid--Carbohydrate--Guanine      Phosphoric acid--Carbohydrate--Cytosine      Phosphoric acid--Carbohydrate--Thymine      Phosphoric acid--Carbohydrate--Adenine    Of the four basic components on the right, thymine occurs in the nucleic  acid from the thymus gland. Yeast contains uracil instead. The  difference between these two bases is one methyl group: thymine is a  5-methyluracil. In all of these basic substances, the structure of urea          NH_{2}       /      C=O       \\        NH_{2}    is involved, and they form pairs of oxidized and reduced states:             PURINE              PYRIMIDINE         (reduced) Adenine + (oxidized) Thymine      (oxidized) Guanine + (reduced)  Cytosine           3N = CH4          |   |      2H--C   CH5          ||  ||          1N--CH6        Pyrimidine           1N==CH6          |  |    H          |  |  7/          N==C--NH_{2}      2H--C  C--N           |  |          || ||5 \\       H--C  C--NH          || ||   \\         || ||  \\          || ||    CH8      || ||   CH          || ||   //        || ||  //          3N--C--N          N--C--N              4  9                           Adenine           Purine               HN--C=O              |  |      NH_{2}--C  C--NH       N==C--NH_{2}  H--N--C=O              || ||  \\       |  |             |  |              || ||   CH   O=C  C--H        O=C  CH              || ||  //      |  ||            |  ||              N--C--N     H--N--CH           HN--CH             Guanine         Cytosine         Uracil      The carbohydrate is ribose or deoxyribose.

From 100 grams of such muscle,  0.35-0.40 grams of this compound were isolated. If the muscle is at  rest, the compound contains three molecules of phosphoric acid, linked  through oxygen atoms. It was named adenosine triphosphate or  adenyltriphosphoric acid,[34] usually abbreviated by the symbol ATP. It  releases one phosphoric acid group very easily and goes over in the  diphosphate, ADP, but it can also lose 2 P-groups as pyrophosphoric acid  and leave the monophosphate, AMP.

Thus, the study of organic phosphates progressed from the comparatively  simple esters connected with fatty substances of organisms to the  proteins and the nuclear substances of the cell. The proportional amount  of phosphorus in the former was larger than in the latter; the actual  importance and function in the life of organisms, however, is not  measured by the quantity but determined by the special nature of the  compounds.

He found coenzyme A which is a nucleotide containing  phosphoric acid.]    [Illustration: Figure 18.--GEORGE DE HEVESY (b. 1885) received the Nobel  Prize in Chemistry in 1943 for his research with isotopic tracer  elements, particularly radiophosphorus of weight 32 (ordinary phosphorus  is 31).]    [Illustration: Figure 19.--CARL F. CORI (b. 1896) AND HIS WIFE, GERTY T.  CORI (1896-1957) received part of the Nobel Prize in Medicine and  Physiology in 1947 for their study on glycogen conversion. In the course  of this study, they identified glucose 1-phosphate, now usually referred  to as \"Cori ester,\" and its function in the glycogen cycle. (_Photo  courtesy National Library of Medicine, Washington, D.C._)]    The study of this function is the newest phase in the history of  phosphorus and represents the culmination of the previous efforts. This  newest phase developed out of an accidental discovery concerning one of  the oldest organic-chemical industries, the production of alcohol by the  fermentative action of yeast on sugar. A transition of carbohydrates  through phosphate compounds to the end products of the fermentation  process was found, and it gradually proved to be a kind of model for a  host of biological processes.    Specific phosphates were thus found to be indispensable for life. In  reverse, the wrong kind of phosphates can destroy life. As a result, an  important part of the new phase in phosphorus history consisted in the  study--and use--of antibiotic phosphorus compounds.          Phosphates in Biological Processes      The first indication that phosphorus is important for life came from the  experience that plants take it up from the substances in the soil. They  incorporate it in their body substance. What makes phosphorus so  important that they cannot grow without it? The next insight was that  animals acquire it from their plant food. It is then found in bones, in  fat and nerve tissue, in all cells and particularly in the cell nuclei.  What are its functions there?    The answers to such questions were developed from the study of a  long-known process, the conversion of carbohydrates into carbon dioxide  and alcohol by yeast. It started with Eduard Buchner's discovery of  1890, that fermentation is produced by a preparation from yeast in which  all living cells have been removed. When yeast is dead-ground and  pressed out, the juice still has the ability to produce fermentation.    It is strange, but in many ways characteristic for the process of  science, that the \"riddle\" of phosphorus in life was solved by first  eliminating life. In such \"lifeless\" fermentations, Arthur Harden found  that the conversion of sugar begins with the formation of a hexose  phosphate (1904). The \"ferment\" of yeast, called zymase, proved to be a  composite of several enzymes. Hans von Euler-Chelpin isolated one part  of zymase, which remains active even after heating its solution to the  boiling point. From 1 kilogram of yeast, he obtained 20 milligrams of  this heat-stable enzyme, which he called cozymase and identified as a  nucleotide composed of a purine, a sugar, and phosphoric acid.[36] In  the years between the two World Wars, zymase was further resolved into  more enzymes, one of them the coenzyme I, which was shown to be ADP  connected with another molecule of ribose attached to the amide of  nicotinic acid, or diphosphopyridine nucleotide:           ^                           NH_{2}        / \\\\                         |       /   \\\\                    N   ^       ||   |-CONH_{2}          //\\ / \\\\       ||   |                   |  ||  N       \\   //                   |  ||  |         N_{+}                  N--+   |         |                      |   \\//         |                      |    N      H--C------+            H--C------+         |      |               |      |      H--C--OH  |            H--C--OH  |         |      O               |      O      H--C--OH  |            H--C--OH  |         |      |               |      |      H--C------+   O     O  H--C------+         |          ||    ||    |         CH_{2}--O--P--O--P--O--CH_{2}                    |     |                    O-    OH                     Coenzyme I    [Illustration: Figure 20.--FRITZ A.
