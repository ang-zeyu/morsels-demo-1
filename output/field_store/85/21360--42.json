Kangaroo bounded away,       His back-legs working like pistons--       Bounded from morning till dark,       Twenty-five feet to a bound.       Yellow-Dog Dingo lay       Like a yellow cloud in the distance--       Much too busy to bark.       My! but they covered the ground!         Nobody knows where they went,       Or followed the track that they flew in,       For that Continent       Hadn't been given a name.       They ran thirty degrees,       From Torres Straits to the Leeuwin       (Look at the Atlas, please),       And they ran back as they came.         S'posing you could trot       From Adelaide to the Pacific,       For an afternoon's run       Half what these gentlemen did       You would feel rather hot,       But your legs would develop terrific--       Yes, my importunate son,       You'd be a Marvellous Kid!          THE BEGINNING OF THE ARMADILLOS    THIS, O Best Beloved, is another story of the High and Far-Off Times.  In the very middle of those times was a Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog, and  he lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon, eating shelly snails and  things. And he had a friend, a Slow-Solid Tortoise, who lived on the  banks of the turbid Amazon, eating green lettuces and things. And so  that was all right, Best Beloved. Do you see?    But also, and at the same time, in those High and Far-Off Times, there  was a Painted Jaguar, and he lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon  too; and he ate everything that he could catch. When he could not catch  deer or monkeys he would eat frogs and beetles; and when he could not  catch frogs and beetles he went to his Mother Jaguar, and she told him  how to eat hedgehogs and tortoises.    She said to him ever so many times, graciously waving her tail, 'My son,  when you find a Hedgehog you must drop him into the water and then he  will uncoil, and when you catch a Tortoise you must scoop him out of his  shell with your paw.' And so that was all right, Best Beloved.    One beautiful night on the banks of the turbid Amazon, Painted Jaguar  found Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog and Slow-Solid Tortoise sitting under the  trunk of a fallen tree. They could not run away, and so Stickly-Prickly  curled himself up into a ball, because he was a Hedgehog, and Slow-Solid  Tortoise drew in his head and feet into his shell as far as they would  go, because he was a Tortoise; and so that was all right, Best Beloved.  Do you see?    'Now attend to me,' said Painted Jaguar, 'because this is very  important. My mother said that when I meet a Hedgehog I am to drop him  into the water and then he will uncoil, and when I meet a Tortoise I am  to scoop him out of his shell with my paw. Now which of you is Hedgehog  and which is Tortoise? because, to save my spots, I can't tell.'    'Are you sure of what your Mummy told you?' said Stickly-Prickly  Hedgehog. 'Are you quite sure? Perhaps she said that when you uncoil a  Tortoise you must shell him out the water with a scoop, and when you paw  a Hedgehog you must drop him on the shell.'    'Are you sure of what your Mummy told you?' said Slow-and-Solid  Tortoise. 'Are you quite sure? Perhaps she said that when you water a  Hedgehog you must drop him into your paw, and when you meet a Tortoise  you must shell him till he uncoils.'    'I don't think it was at all like that,' said Painted Jaguar, but he  felt a little puzzled; 'but, please, say it again more distinctly.'    'When you scoop water with your paw you uncoil it with a Hedgehog,' said  Stickly-Prickly. 'Remember that, because it's important.'    'But,' said the Tortoise, 'when you paw your meat you drop it into a  Tortoise with a scoop. Why can't you understand?'    'You are making my spots ache,' said Painted Jaguar; 'and besides, I  didn't want your advice at all. I only wanted to know which of you is  Hedgehog and which is Tortoise.'    'I shan't tell you,' said Stickly-Prickly, 'but you can scoop me out of  my shell if you like.'    'Aha!' said Painted Jaguar. 'Now I know you're Tortoise. You thought I  wouldn't! Now I will.' Painted Jaguar darted out his paddy-paw just as  Stickly-Prickly curled himself up, and of course Jaguar's paddy-paw was  just filled with prickles. Worse than that, he knocked Stickly-Prickly  away and away into the woods and the bushes, where it was too dark to  find him. Then he put his paddy-paw into his mouth, and of course the  prickles hurt him worse than ever. As soon as he could speak he said,  'Now I know he isn't Tortoise at all. But'--and then he scratched  his head with his un-prickly paw--'how do I know that this other is  Tortoise?'    'But I am Tortoise,' said Slow-and-Solid. Your mother was quite right.  She said that you were to scoop me out of my shell with your paw.  Begin.'    'You didn't say she said that a minute ago, said Painted Jaguar, sucking  the prickles out of his paddy-paw. 'You said she said something quite  different.'    'Well, suppose you say that I said that she said something quite  different, I don't see that it makes any difference; because if she said  what you said I said she said, it's just the same as if I said what she  said she said. On the other hand, if you think she said that you were to  uncoil me with a scoop, instead of pawing me into drops with a shell, I  can't help that, can I?'    'But you said you wanted to be scooped out of your shell with my paw,'  said Painted Jaguar.    'If you'll think again you'll find that I didn't say anything of the  kind. I said that your mother said that you were to scoop me out of my  shell,' said Slow-and-Solid.    'What will happen if I do?' said the Jaguar most sniffily and most  cautious.    'I don't know, because I've never been scooped out of my shell before;  but I tell you truly, if you want to see me swim away you've only got to  drop me into the water.    'I don't believe it,' said Painted Jaguar. 'You've mixed up all the  things my mother told me to do with the things that you asked me whether  I was sure that she didn't say, till I don't know whether I'm on my  head or my painted tail; and now you come and tell me something I can  understand, and it makes me more mixy than before. My mother told me  that I was to drop one of you two into the water, and as you seem so  anxious to be dropped I think you don't want to be dropped. So jump into  the turbid Amazon and be quick about it.'    'I warn you that your Mummy won't be pleased. Don't tell her I didn't  tell you,' said Slow-Solid.    'If you say another word about what my mother said--' the Jaguar  answered, but he had not finished the sentence before Slow-and-Solid  quietly dived into the turbid Amazon, swam under water for a long way,  and came out on the bank where Stickly-Prickly was waiting for him.    'That was a very narrow escape,' said Stickly-Prickly. 'I don't rib  Painted Jaguar. What did you tell him that you were?'    'I told him truthfully that I was a truthful Tortoise, but he wouldn't  believe it, and he made me jump into the river to see if I was, and I  was, and he is surprised. Now he's gone to tell his Mummy. Listen to  him!'    They could hear Painted Jaguar roaring up and down among the trees and  the bushes by the side of the turbid Amazon, till his Mummy came.    'Son, son!' said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving her  tail, 'what have you been doing that you shouldn't have done?'    'I tried to scoop something that said it wanted to be scooped out of  its shell with my paw, and my paw is full of per-ickles,' said Painted  Jaguar.    'Son, son!' said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving her  tail, 'by the prickles in your paddy-paw I see that that must have been  a Hedgehog. You should have dropped him into the water.    'I did that to the other thing; and he said he was a Tortoise, and I  didn't believe him, and it was quite true, and he has dived under the  turbid Amazon, and he won't come up again, and I haven't anything at all  to eat, and I think we had better find lodgings somewhere else. They are  too clever on the turbid Amazon for poor me!'    'Son, son!' said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving  her tail, 'now attend to me and remember what I say. A Hedgehog curls  himself up into a ball and his prickles stick out every which way at  once. By this you may know the Hedgehog.'    'I don't like this old lady one little bit,' said Stickly-Prickly, under  the shadow of a large leaf. 'I wonder what else she knows?'    'A Tortoise can't curl himself up,' Mother Jaguar went on, ever so many  times, graciously waving her tail. 'He only draws his head and legs into  his shell. By this you may know the tortoise.'    'I don't like this old lady at all--at all,' said Slow-and-Solid  Tortoise. 'Even Painted Jaguar can't forget those directions. It's a  great pity that you can't swim, Stickly-Prickly.'    'Don't talk to me,' said Stickly-Prickly. 'Just think how much better  it would be if you could curl up. This is a mess! Listen to Painted  Jaguar.'    Painted Jaguar was sitting on the banks of the turbid Amazon sucking  prickles out of his Paws and saying to himself--      'Can't curl, but can swim--    Slow-Solid, that's him!    Curls up, but can't swim--    Stickly-Prickly, that's him!'    'He'll never forget that this month of Sundays,' said Stickly-Prickly.  'Hold up my chin, Slow-and-Solid. I'm going to try to learn to swim. It  may be useful.'    'Excellent!' said Slow-and-Solid; and he held up Stickly-Prickly's chin,  while Stickly-Prickly kicked in the waters of the turbid Amazon.    'You'll make a fine swimmer yet,' said Slow-and-Solid. 'Now, if you can  unlace my back-plates a little, I'll see what I can do towards curling  up. It may be useful.'    Stickly-Prickly helped to unlace Tortoise's back-plates, so that by  twisting and straining Slow-and-Solid actually managed to curl up a  tiddy wee bit.    'Excellent!' said Stickly-Prickly; 'b"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27827"],[0,"The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana (#6)"],[1,"be peculiar to particular parts of  it. These and similar other amusements should always be carried on by  citizens.    The above amusements should be followed by a person who diverts himself  alone in company with a courtesan, as well as by a courtesan who can do  the same in company with her maid servants or with citizens.    A Pithamarda[26] is a man without wealth, alone in the world, whose only  property consists of his Mallika,[27] some lathering, substance and a  red cloth, who comes from a good country, and who is skilled in all the  arts; and by teaching these arts is received in the company of citizens,  and in the abode of public women.    A Vita[28] is a man who has enjoyed the pleasures of fortune, who is a  compatriot of the citizens with whom he associates, who is possessed of  the qualities of a householder, who has his wife with him, and who is  honoured in the assembly of citizens, and in the abodes of public women,  and lives on their means and on them.    A Vidushaka[29] (also called a Vaihasaka, _i.e._, one who provokes  laughter) is a person only acquainted with some of the arts who is a  jester, and who is trusted by all.    These persons are employed in matters of quarrels and reconciliations  between citizens and public women.    This remark applies also to female beggars, to women with their heads  shaved, to adulterous women, and to old public women skilled in all the  various arts.    Thus a citizen living in his town or village, respected by all, should  call on the persons of his own caste who may be worth knowing. He should  converse in company and gratify his friends by his society, and obliging  others by his assistance in various matters, he should cause them to  assist one another in the same way.    There are some verses on this subject as follows:--    A citizen discoursing, not entirely in the Sanscrit language,[30] nor  wholly in the dialects of the country, on various topics in society,  obtains great respect. The wise should not resort to a society disliked  by the public, governed by no rules, and intent on the destruction of  others. But a learned man living in a society which acts according to  the wishes of the people, and which has pleasure for its only object is  highly respected in this world.

The  subject is dealt with at some length in H. H. Wilson's 'Select Specimens  of the Theatre of the Hindoos,' in two volumes, Trubner & Co., 1871. It  may be fairly considered that the courtesan was one of the elements, and  an important element too, of early Hindoo society, and that her  education and intellect were both superior to that of the women of the  household. Wilson says, \"By the Vesya or courtesan, however, we are not  to understand a female who has disregarded the obligation of law or the  precepts of virtue, but a character reared by a state of manners  unfriendly to the admission of wedded females into society, and opening  it only at the expense of reputation to women who were trained for  association with men by personal and mental acquirements to which the  matron was a stranger.\"]    [Footnote 26: According to this description a Pithamarda would be a sort  of professor of all the arts, and as such received as the friend and  confidant of the citizens.]    [Footnote 27: A seat in the form of the letter T.]    [Footnote 28: The Vita is supposed to represent somewhat the character  of the Parasite of the Greek comedy.

Wilson says  of him that he is the humble companion, not the servant, of a prince or  man of rank, and it is a curious peculiarity that he is always a  Brahman. He bears more affinity to Sancho Panza, perhaps, than any other  character in western fiction, imitating him in his combination of  shrewdness and simplicity, his fondness of good living and his love of  ease. In the dramas of intrigue he exhibits some of the talents of  Mercury, but with less activity and ingenuity, and occasionally suffers  by his interference. According to the technical definition of his  attributes he is to excite mirth by being ridiculous in person, age, and  attire.]    [Footnote 30: This means, it is presumed, that the citizen should be  acquainted with several languages. The middle part of this paragraph  might apply to the Nihilists and Fenians of the day, or to secret  societies. It was perhaps a reference to the Thugs.]          CHAPTER V.    ABOUT THE KINDS OF WOMEN RESORTED TO BY THE CITIZENS, AND OF FRIENDS AND  MESSENGERS.      When Kama is practised by men of the four castes according to the rules  of the Holy Writ (_i.e._, by lawful marriage) with virgins of their own  caste, it then becomes a means of acquiring lawful progeny and good  fame, and it is not also opposed to the customs of the world. On the  contrary the practice of Kama with women of the higher castes, and with  those previously enjoyed by others, even though they be of the same  caste, is prohibited. But the practice of Kama with women of the lower  castes, with women excommunicated from their own caste, with public  women, and with women twice married,[31] is neither enjoined nor  prohibited. The object of practising Kama with such women is pleasure  only.    Nayikas,[32] therefore, are of three kinds, viz., maids, women twice  married, and public women. Gonikaputra has expressed an opinion that  there is a fourth kind of Nayika, viz., a woman who is resorted to on  some special occasion even though she be previously married to another.  These special occasions are when a man thinks thus:--         (_a_). This woman is self-willed, and has been previously enjoyed                by many others besides myself. I may, therefore, safely                resort to her as to a public woman though she belongs to a                higher caste than mine, and in so doing I shall not be                violating the ordinances of                Dharma.    Or thus:--         (_b_). This is a twice-married woman and has been enjoyed by others                before me, there is, therefore, no objection to my                resorting to her.    Or thus:--         (_c_). This woman has gained the heart of her great and powerful                husband, and exercises a mastery over him, who is a friend                of my enemy; if, therefore, she becomes united with me,                she will cause her husband to abandon my enemy.    Or thus:--         (_d_). This woman will turn the mind of her husband, who is very                powerful, in my favour, he being at present disaffected                towards me, and intent on doing me some harm.    Or thus:--         (_e_). By making this woman my friend I shall gain the object of                some friend of mine, or shall be able to effect the ruin                of some enemy, or shall accomplish some other difficult                purpose.    Or thus:--         (_f_). By being united with this woman, I shall kill her husband,                and so obtain his vast riches which I covet.    Or thus:--         (_g_). The union of this woman with me is not attended with any                danger, and will bring me wealth, of which, on account of                my poverty and inability to support myself, I am very much                in need. I shall, therefore, obtain her vast riches in                this way without any difficulty.    Or thus:--         (_h_). This woman loves me ardently, and knows all my weak points,                if therefore, I am unwilling to be united with her, she                will make my faults public, and thus tarnish my character                and reputation. Or she will bring some gross accusation                against me, of which it may be hard to clear myself, and I                shall be ruined. Or perhaps she will detach from me her                husband, who is powerful, and yet under her control, and                will unite him to my enemy, or will herself join the latter.    Or thus:--         (_i_). The husband of this woman has violated the chastity of my                wives, I shall therefore return that injury by seducing            "]]]
