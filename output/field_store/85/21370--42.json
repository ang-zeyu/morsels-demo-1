Among them each succeeding element acquires the quality of the  preceding; and in as many degrees as each of them is advanced, with so  many properties is it said to be endued. He, too, first assigned to all  creatures distinct names, distinct acts, and distinct occupations, as they  had been revealed in the pre-existing Veda. He, the supreme ruler, created  an assemblage of inferior _Deities_, with divine attributes and pure  souls, and a number of Genii exquisitely delicate; and he prescribed the  sacrifice from the beginning. From fire, from air, and from the sun he  milked out, as it were, three primordial Vedas, named Rich, Yajush and  Saman, for the due performance of the sacrifice.    \"He gave being to time and the divisions of time, to the stars also, and  to the planets, to rivers, oceans and mountains, to level plains and  uneven valleys, to devotion, speech, complacency, desire and wrath, and to  the creation, which shall presently be mentioned; for he willed the  existence of all those created things. For the sake of distinguishing  actions, he made a total difference between right and wrong, and enured  these sentient creatures to pleasure and pain, cold and heat, and other  opposite pairs. With very minute transformable portions called matras, of  the five elements, all this perceptible world was composed in fit order;  and in whatever occupation the Supreme Lord first employed any vital soul,  to that occupation the same soul attaches itself spontaneously when it  receives a new body again and again. Whatever quality, noxious or  innocent, harsh or mild, unjust or just, false or true, he conferred on  any being at its creation, the same quality enters it, of course, on its  future births; as the six seasons of the year attain respectively their  peculiar marks in due time and of their own accord, even so the several  acts of each embodied spirit attend it naturally.    \"That the human race might be multiplied, he caused the Brahmen, the  Cshatriya, the Vaisya and the Sudra to proceed from his mouth, his arm,  his thigh and his foot.    \"Having divided his own substance, the mighty power became half male, half  female, or nature active and passive, and from that female he produced  Viraz. Know me, O most excellent of Brahmens, to be that person whom the  male power, Viraz, having performed austere devotion, produced by myself;  me, the secondary framer of all this visible world. It was I who, desirous  of giving birth to a race of men, performed very difficult religious  duties, and first produced ten Lords of created beings, animated in  holiness, Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Cratu, Prachetas, or  Dacsha, Vasishtha, Bhrigu and Narada; they, abundant in glory, produced  seven other Menu, together with deities and the mansions of deities, and  Maharshis, or great sages, unlimited in power; benevolent genii, and  fierce giants, blood-thirsty savages, heavenly quiristers, nymphs and  demons, huge serpents and snakes of smaller size, birds of mighty wing,  and separate companies of Pitirs, or progenitors of mankind; lightnings  and thunder-bolts, clouds and colored bows of Indra, falling meteors,  earth-rending vapors, comets and luminaries of various degrees;  horse-faced sylvans, apes, fish, and a variety of birds, tame cattle,  deer, men, and ravenous beasts with two rows of teeth; small and large  reptiles, moths, lice, fleas, and common flies, with every biting knat and  immovable substances of distinct sorts.\"    Reader, I have given you this chapter of ancient cosmogonies under the  conviction that a bare statement of them must convince any one of either  the ignorance or dishonesty of infidels who claim that Moses learned all  that he gave in his cosmogony from the ancient cosmogonies. How was it  that Moses avoided all their errors and extravagance? How was it that he  gave such a severely simple description of creation, which no rhetoric can  improve, and no scientist _successfully_ refute?            Can you believe that energy, or force, lies behind all things, operating  them, without believing there is something lying behind it, to which it  belongs?    Can you believe that a concourse of dead atoms held a solemn convention,  went into harmonious action and produced life?            SOME OF THE BEAUTIES (?) OF HARMONY AMONG UNBELIEVERS.      The author of \"The System of Nature\" says of the English Jesuit's creation  of eels by spontaneous generation from rye meal: \"After moistening meal  with water, and shutting up the mixture, it is found after a little time,  with the aid of the microscope, that it has produced organized beings, of  whose production the water and meal were believed to be incapable. Thus  inanimate nature can pass into life, which is itself but an assemblage of  motions.\"--_Part 1, p. 23. For Needham's Eels, see the Volume of Physics_.    Voltaire says: \"Were this unparalleled blunder true, yet, in rigorous  reasoning I do not see how it would prove there is no God.\"    He says, it is really strange that men, while denying a creator should  have attributed to themselves the power of creating eels. But it is yet  more deplorable that natural philosophers, of better information, adopted  the Jesuit Needham's ridiculous system, and joined it to that of Maillet,  who asserted that the ocean had formed the Alps and the Pyrenees, and that  men were originally porpoises, whose forked tails changed in the course of  time into thighs and legs. Such fancies are worthy to be placed with the  eels formed by meal.    Voltaire says the ridiculous story of the spontaneous production of eels  by rye meal is the foundation of D'Holbach's \"System of Nature.\" He says:  \"We were assured, not long ago, that at Brussels a hen had brought forth  half a dozen rabbits.\" He then adds, \"Needham's eels soon followed the  Brussels hen.\" D'Holbach says: \"Experience proves to us that the matter  which we regard as inert and dead, assumes action, intelligence, and life,  when it is combined in a certain way.\" Voltaire responds: \"This is  precisely the difficulty. How does a germ come to life?\"    The author of the \"System of Nature\" says: \"Matter is eternal and  necessary; but its forms and its combinations are transitory and  contingent.\" Upon the supposition that _all is __ matter_, Voltaire  answers, it is hard to comprehend, matter being, according to our author,  _necessary_, and without freedom, how there can be anything contingent.    Again, the atheistic author of the \"System of Nature\" asserts that order  and disorder do not exist. This is strongly refuted by Voltaire, who says  the author is to be distrusted very often, both in physics and in morals.    Spinosa was a pantheist. He, like many modern sciolists, repudiated design  in nature. Voltaire, treating upon Spinosism, says: \"I am aware that  various philosophers, and especially Lucretius, have denied final causes.  I am also aware that Lucretius, though not very chaste, is a very great  poet in his descriptions and in his morals; but in philosophy I own he  appears to me to be very far behind a college porter or a parish beadle.  To affirm that the eye is not made to see, nor the ear to hear, nor the  stomach to digest, is not this the most revolting folly that ever entered  the human mind? Doubter as I am, this _insanity_ seems to me _evident_,  and _I say so_. For my part, I see in nature, as in the arts, only final  causes; and I believe that an apple tree is made to bear apples, as I  believe that a watch is made to tell the hour.\" Voltaire charges Warburton  with calumniating Cicero, by saying that Cicero said, \"It is unworthy of  the majesty of the empire to adore one only God.\" Voltaire's words are  these: \"Warburton, like his contemporaries, has calumniated Cicero and  ancient Rome.\" He then gives the above quotation, along with a short  comment in Cicero's defense, and closes with the following words: \"It is  then quite false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did  not become the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their  Jupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks, the Jehovah of the Phoenicians, was always  considered as the master of the secondary gods. This great truth can not  be too forcibly inculcated.\" Voltaire was a Deist.    Lucretius, according to Voltaire, denied design in nature. Voltaire said,  in philosophy, he was very far behind a college porter or a parish beadle.    Spinosa was a Pantheist. Voltaire says, \"He frequently contradicted  himself; that he had not always clear ideas; that he sometimes clung to  one plank, sometimes to another.\"    Voltaire says: \"A natural philosopher of some reputation had no doubt that  this 'Needham,' who made the eels, 'was a profound Atheist,' who concluded  that since eels could be made of rye meal, men might be made of wheat  flour; that nature and chemistry produce all; and that it was demonstrated  we may very well dispense with an all forming God.\" Voltaire calls this  _an unparalleled blunder_. D'Holbach, the author of the \"System de la  Nature,\" was an Atheist, so were his assistants in the production of that  work.    Voltaire addresses the author of that work in the following words: \"In the  state of doubt in which we both are, I do not say to you, with Pascal,  'choose the safest.' There is no safety in uncertainty. We are here not to  talk, but to examine; we must judge, and our judgment is not determined by  our will. I do not propose to you to believe extravagant things in order  to escape embarassment. I do not say to you, 'Go to Mecca, and instruct  yourself by kissing the black stone, take hold of a cow's tail, muffle  yourself in a scapulary, or be imbecile and fanatical to acquire the favor  of the Being of beings.' I say to you, 'Continue to cultivate virtue, to  be beneficent, to regard all superstition with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28075"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, March, 1880 (#6)"],[1,"ist's study--in fine, from all  the schools of science and arts should human law be _declared_, instead of  being 'enacted' in legislative halls by those who in every respect besides  political trickery, fraud and 'smartness,' are perfect ignoramuses.\" How  is all this to be reconciled with the ideas of self-government set forth  by this author and copied in this article? Who are to be the doctors, and  who are to be the patients? When _popular_ discussion is confined to art  and science, only as it may be used in order to keep it out of religious  and state affairs, who are to be the _popular_ free disputants? When  legislative halls are done away, along with their _progenitors_, elective  franchise and representation, and law emanates from all the schools of  science and art by \"declaration,\" will men be more ready to obey?    Give the sore-headed, politically gangrened, conscienceless, virtueless,  Godless applauders of Tom Paine what they ask, and it will simply amount  to abandoning our posterity to the lowest, vilest sensualism known in  Pagan geography along the line or borderland of a foul lust-gratifying,  brutalizing _hell_. May all Christian people, and every lover of our  humanity, wake up to the importance of giving these wide-mouthed, blatant  infidels, who are traveling over our country howling about \"liberty of  man, woman and child,\" a wide berth. They would like to be the \"doctors,\"  and treat the \"orthodox\" people so as to purge \"_popular_ free discussion\"  out of them, and at the same time have their own stomachs crammed full of  that grace, and so \"steal heaven's livery to serve the devil.\" The above  _infidelism_ is copied _verbatim_ from the \"concluding application\" of the  life of Thomas Paine by Calvin Blanchard, published in 1879, and being now  peddled over our country. What do our infidel friends mean by so much ado  about liberty as opposed to the present state of society in our country?  Free thought belongs to all. You can't chain the mind. What is it that  they want? Will they be so kind as to inform us? Is Calvin Blanchard a  representative of the liberty sought for? Then may we long live to keep  our heels upon it.            DID THE RACE ASCEND FROM A LOW STATE OF BARBARISM?      The fact that the human mind abhors a contradiction is an evidence of the  Godlike nature of man, and an objection to the old tenet of total  depravity; it is also the secret of the effort, upon the part of  errorists, to systematize. One assumption creates a demand for another,  and thus men who start wrong, in science or religion, labor under great  disadvantages. When an idea is once consecrated to science or religion in  the human heart it is hard to eradicate. When you find that you have made  a wrong start remember that it is the part of true manhood to make a frank  surrender, and start anew.    The assumption of the \"evolution of species\" lays all its advocates under  the necessity of assuming that a low state of barbarism lies behind the  civilization known in the history of the race as the primitive or first  condition of intellect. Now, as this is a question of fact, an examination  of the evidence pertaining to this second assumption is a matter of  primary importance. What are the facts bearing upon the question? With  Darwinians the \"primeval savage\" is a stereotyped idea, finding expression  in every-day language; and an idea that some scientists (rather sciolists)  never get tired of promulgating. With them primitive man was little  removed from the brute beasts, devoid of knowledge, art, and language--a  creature in a small degree above; and in a great degree below, the  anthropoid apes, from whom it is claimed he has descended by evolution. Is  there any proof of this primitive inferiority, or savagery, as opposed to  civilization? How does the voice of history speak? It doubtless shows many  instances of improvement, of an advance from a low condition to a higher  one; but what does the earliest history say as respects the _primitive  condition of mankind_? Waiving an examination of the Bible history, we  will at once proceed to other sources. In Egypt there are no indications  of an early period of barbarism. All authorities agree that we find no  rude or heathenish time in the far off history of Egypt out of which  civilization was evolved. The first king known in Egyptian history, Menes,  changes the channel of the river Nile, makes a great reservoir, and erects  the Temple of Phthah at Memphis. His son Athothis is known as the builder  of the Memphite Palace, and as a physician, who wrote books on anatomy.  The pyramid times are early in Egyptian history; the portrayed scenes in  the tombs of this early period reveal the same habits which existed in  after times. That writing had been long in use is demonstrated by the  hieroglyphics in the Great Pyramid. Go as far back as you may in Egyptian  history, you will find no primitive barbarous mode of life. Sir Charles  Lyell admitted, in \"Antiquity of Man,\" p. 90, that \"we have no distinct  _geological evidence_ that the appearance of what are called the inferior  races of mankind has always preceded in chronological order that of the  higher races.\"    George Rawlinson says Mr. Pengelly made a similar confession at the  meeting of the British Association at Bristol, in August, 1875. So far as  this question of evolution is concerned, it is just as easy to establish  involution of civilization into barbarism as evolution of civilization out  of barbarism. Herodotus gives an account of the Geloni, a Greek people,  who were driven from the cities on the northern coast of the Euxine, and  retiring into the interior, lived in wooden huts, and used a language half  Scythian and half Greek. We follow this people down to the times of Mala  and find them fully barbarous, using the skins of those slain in battle as  coverings both for themselves and their horses. The Copts, of our times,  are degraded descendants of the ancient Egyptians. In North and South  America the descendants of the Spanish conquerers are poor representatives  of those Castilians who, under Pizarro and Cortez mastered the Peruvian  and Mexican kingdoms, and planted the civilization of the old world in the  new. Civilization is liable to decay, to wane, to deteriorate, to sink so  low that it may be a question whether it is any longer civilization. In  the cases we have alluded to we have a low degradation retaining evidences  of something higher. In comparative philology we have cases where it is  presumed by the best of critics that a higher state of civilization sank  to the lowest conceivable state of heathenism. The race existing in  Ceylon, known as the \"Weddas,\" is of this type. The language of the Weddas  is regarded as a base descendant of the most complete and first known form  of Aryan speech, the Sanskrit; and the Weddas are set down as descendants  of the Sanskritic Aryans, who conquered India. There are no savages of a  more debased type. They do not count beyond two or three; they have no  idea of letters; of all the animals the dog alone is domesticated; their  art consists in making bows and arrows and constructing rude huts; they  are dwindling and threaten to become extinct. See \"Report of the British  Association for the advancement of science, for the Year 1875,\" part 3, p.  175.    Civilization and barbarism are states between which men oscillate, passing  from one to the other with equal ease, according to the influences brought  to bear upon them.    The mythical traditions of almost all peoples place at the beginning of  the history of the race, a \"golden age,\" which is the opposite of savagery  and barbarism. The Chinese speak of a \"first heaven,\" an age of innocence  and a state of happiness, when \"all was beautiful and good, and all beings  were perfect.\" Mexican tradition speaks of the golden age of Tezcuco; and  Peruvian history commences with two \"Children of the Sun,\" who established  civilization on the borders of Lake Titicaca. The Greeks described their  golden age as follows:          \"The immortal gods, that tread the courts of heaven,      First made a golden race of mortal men.      Like gods they lived, with happy, careless souls,      From toil and pain exempt; nor on them crept      Wretched old age, but all their life was passed      In feasting, and their limbs no changes knew.      Nought evil came them nigh; and, when they died,      'Twas but as if they were o'ercome by sleep.      All good things were their portion; the fat soil      Bare them its fruit spontaneous, fruit ungrudged      And plentiful; they, at their own sweet will,      Pursued in peace the tasks that seemed them good,      Laden with blessings, rich in flocks, and dear      To the great gods.\"--_Hesiod._      Such is the light that shines from the region where myth and history meet  and wed. Can we go beyond this? There is no people, east or west,  characterized by an uninterrupted _progress_ from barbarism to  civilization. So the theory of time based upon such an idea is altogether  without foundation.            THE FLOOD VIEWED FROM A SCIENTIFIC AND BIBLICAL STANDPOINT.      Unbelievers usually pass over the events of the flood with mockery. There  is something about them that is only reconcilable with the mental  condition of the man who says in his heart, \"There is no God.\" The old  methods of their interpretation of the Scriptures have been abandoned in  many particulars. This is the result of two things: first, progression in  scientific knowledge; and, second, the Bible was always ahead of science  in its scientific allusions. Now, it is known to scientists that there is,  at the lowest calculation, forty-eight times more water in our seas and  oceans than Keill was willing to allow when he made the objection that it  would require the waters of twenty-eight oceans to give us Noah's flood.  The objection was, \"there is not water enough.\" Men"]]]
