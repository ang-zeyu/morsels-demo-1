What do you say to the idea?\"    At the reverent thankfulness in the pale eyes of the broken old man who  had so recently been a perfect specimen of vigorous youth, Alton  Forsythe blew his nose noisily. The little judge smiled benevolently and  shook his head as if to say, \"I told you so.\" Tom and Old Crompton  gripped hands--mightily.           *       *       *       *       *      _COMING, NEXT MONTH_    BRIGANDS OF THE MOON    By RAY CUMMINGS           *       *       *       *       *          Spawn of the Stars    _By Charles Willard Diffin_          The Earth lay powerless beneath those loathsome, yellowish      monsters that, sheathed in cometlike globes, sprang from the      skies to annihilate man and reduce his cities to ashes.    [Illustration: _The sky was alive with winged shapes, and high in the  air shone the glittering menace, trailing five plumes of gas._]      When Cyrus R. Thurston bought himself a single-motored Stoughton job he  was looking for new thrills. Flying around the east coast had lost its  zest: he wanted to join that jaunty group who spoke so easily of hopping  off for Los Angeles.    And what Cyrus Thurston wanted he usually obtained. But if that young  millionaire-sportsman had been told that on his first flight this  blocky, bulletlike ship was to pitch him headlong into the exact center  of the wildest, strangest war this earth had ever seen--well, it is  still probable that the Stoughton company would not have lost the sale.    They were roaring through the starlit, calm night, three thousand feet  above a sage sprinkled desert, when the trip ended. Slim Riley had the  stick when the first blast of hot oil ripped slashingly across the  pilot's window. \"There goes your old trip!\" he yelled. \"Why don't they  try putting engines in these ships?\"    [Illustration]    He jammed over the throttle and, with motor idling, swept down toward  the endless miles of moonlit waste. Wind? They had been boring into it.  Through the opened window he spotted a likely stretch of ground. Setting  down the ship on a nice piece of Arizona desert was a mere detail for  Slim.    \"Let off a flare,\" he ordered, \"when I give the word.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The white glare of it faded the stars as he sideslipped, then  straightened out on his hand-picked field. The plane rolled down a clear  space and stopped. The bright glare persisted while he stared curiously  from the quiet cabin. Cutting the motor he opened both windows, then  grabbed Thurston by the shoulder.    \"'Tis a curious thing, that,\" he said unsteadily. His hand pointed  straight ahead. The flare died, but the bright stars of the desert  country still shone on a glistening, shining bulb.    It was some two hundred feet away. The lower part was lost in shadow,  but its upper surfaces shone rounded and silvery like a giant bubble. It  towered in the air, scores of feet above the chaparral beside it. There  was a round spot of black on its side, which looked absurdly like a  door....    \"I saw something moving,\" said Thurston slowly. \"On the ground I saw....  Oh, good Lord, Slim, it isn't real!\"    Slim Riley made no reply. His eyes were riveted to an undulating,  ghastly something that oozed and crawled in the pale light not far from  the bulb. His hand was reaching, reaching.... It found what he sought;  he leaned toward the window. In his hand was the Very pistol for  discharging the flares. He aimed forward and up.    The second flare hung close before it settled on the sandy floor. Its  blinding whiteness made the more loathsome the sickening yellow of the  flabby flowing thing that writhed frantically in the glare. It was  formless, shapeless, a heaving mound of nauseous matter. Yet even in its  agonized writhing distortions they sensed the beating pulsations that  marked it a living thing.    There were unending ripplings crossing and recrossing through the  convolutions. To Thurston there was suddenly a sickening likeness: the  thing was a brain from a gigantic skull--it was naked--was  suffering....           *       *       *       *       *    The thing poured itself across the sand. Before the staring gaze of the  speechless men an excrescence appeared--a thick bulb on the mass--that  protruded itself into a tentacle. At the end there grew instantly a  hooked hand. It reached for the black opening in the great shell, found  it, and the whole loathsome shapelessness poured itself up and through  the hole.    Only at the last was it still. In the dark opening the last slippery  mass held quiet for endless seconds. It formed, as they watched, to a  head--frightful--menacing. Eyes appeared in the head; eyes flat and  round and black save for a cross slit in each; eyes that stared horribly  and unchangingly into theirs. Below them a gaping mouth opened and  closed.... The head melted--was gone....    And with its going came a rushing roar of sound.    From under the metallic mass shrieked a vaporous cloud. It drove at  them, a swirling blast of snow and sand. Some buried memory of gas  attacks woke Riley from his stupor. He slammed shut the windows  an instant before the cloud struck, but not before they had seen,  in the moonlight, a gleaming, gigantic, elongated bulb rise  swiftly--screamingly--into the upper air.    The blast tore at their plane. And the cold in their tight compartment  was like the cold of outer space. The men stared, speechless, panting.  Their breath froze in that frigid room into steam clouds.    \"It--it....\" Thurston gasped--and slumped helpless upon the floor.           *       *       *       *       *    It was an hour before they dared open the door of their cabin. An hour  of biting, numbing cold. Zero--on a warm summer night on the desert!  Snow in the hurricane that had struck them!    \"'Twas the blast from the thing,\" guessed the pilot; \"though never did  I see an engine with an exhaust like that.\" He was pounding himself with  his arms to force up the chilled circulation.    \"But the beast--the--the _thing_!\" exclaimed Thurston. \"It's monstrous;  indecent! It thought--no question of that--but no body! Horrible! Just a  raw, naked, thinking protoplasm!\"    It was here that he flung open the door. They sniffed cautiously of the  air. It was warm again--clean--save for a hint of some nauseous odor.  They walked forward; Riley carried a flash.    The odor grew to a stench as they came where the great mass had lain. On  the ground was a fleshy mound. There were bones showing, and horns on a  skull. Riley held the light close to show the body of a steer. A body of  raw bleeding meat. Half of it had been absorbed....    \"The damned thing,\" said Riley, and paused vainly for adequate words.  \"The damned thing was eating.... Like a jelly-fish, it was!\"    \"Exactly,\" Thurston agreed. He pointed about. There were other heaps  scattered among the low sage.    \"Smothered,\" guessed Thurston, \"with that frozen exhaust. Then the  filthy thing landed and came out to eat.\"    \"Hold the light for me,\" the pilot commanded. \"I'm goin' to fix that  busted oil line. And I'm goin' to do it right now. Maybe the creature's  still hungry.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They sat in their room. About them was the luxury of a modern hotel.  Cyrus Thurston stared vacantly at the breakfast he was forgetting to  eat. He wiped his hands mechanically on a snowy napkin. He looked from  the window. There were palm trees in the park, and autos in a ceaseless  stream. And people! Sane, sober people, living in a sane world. Newsboys  were shouting; the life of the city was flowing.    \"Riley!\" Thurston turned to the man across the table. His voice was  curiously toneless, and his face haggard. \"Riley, I haven't slept for  three nights. Neither have you. We've got to get this thing straight. We  didn't both become absolute maniacs at the same instant, but--it was  _not_ there, it was _never_ there--not _that_....\" He was lost in  unpleasant recollections. \"There are other records of hallucinations.\"    \"Hallucinations--hell!\" said Slim Riley. He was looking at a Los Angeles  newspaper. He passed one hand wearily across his eyes, but his face was  happier than it had been in days.    \"We didn't imagine it, we aren't crazy--it's real! Would you read that  now!\" He passed the paper across to Thurston. The headlines were  startling.    \"Pilot Killed by Mysterious Airship. Silvery Bubble Hangs Over New York.  Downs Army Plane in Burst of Flame. Vanishes at Terrific Speed.\"    \"It's our little friend,\" said Thurston. And on his face, too, the lines  were vanishing; to find this horror a reality was positive relief.  \"Here's the same cloud of vapor--drifted slowly across the city,  the accounts says, blowing this stuff like steam from underneath.  Airplanes investigated--an army plane drove into the vapor--terrific  explosion--plane down in flames--others wrecked. The machine ascended  with meteor speed, trailing blue flame. Come on, boy, where's that old  bus? Thought I never wanted to fly a plane again. Now I don't want to do  anything but.\"    \"Where to?\" Slim inquired.    \"Headquarters,\" Thurston told him. \"Washington--let's go!\"           *       *       *       *       *    From Los Angeles to Washington is not far, as the plane flies. There was  a stop or two for gasoline, but it was only a day later that they were  seated in the War Office. Thurston's card had gained immediate  admittance. \"Got the low-down,\" he had written on the back of his card,  \"on the mystery airship.\"    \"What you have told me is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2865"],[0,"Otto of the Silver Hand (#6)"],[1,"arch of the great gateway and in the gray gloaming of  the paved court-yard within.    Otto looked around upon the many faces gathered there to catch the  first sight of the little baron; hard, rugged faces, seamed and  weather-beaten; very different from those of the gentle brethren among  whom he had lived, and it seemed strange to him that there was none  there whom he should know.    As he climbed the steep, stony steps to the door of the Baron's house,  old Ursela came running down to meet him. She flung her withered arms  around him and hugged him close to her. \"My little child,\" she cried,  and then fell to sobbing as though her heart would break.    \"Here is someone knoweth me,\" thought the little boy.    His new home was all very strange and wonderful to Otto; the armors, the  trophies, the flags, the long galleries with their ranges of rooms,  the great hall below with its vaulted roof and its great fireplace of  grotesquely carved stone, and all the strange people with their lives  and thoughts so different from what he had been used to know.    And it was a wonderful thing to explore all the strange places in the  dark old castle; places where it seemed to Otto no one could have ever  been before.    Once he wandered down a long, dark passageway below the hall, pushed  open a narrow, iron-bound oaken door, and found himself all at once in  a strange new land; the gray light, coming in through a range of tall,  narrow windows, fell upon a row of silent, motionless figures carven in  stone, knights and ladies in strange armor and dress; each lying upon  his or her stony couch with clasped hands, and gazing with fixed,  motionless, stony eyeballs up into the gloomy, vaulted arch above them.  There lay, in a cold, silent row, all of the Vuelphs who had died since  the ancient castle had been built.    It was the chapel into which Otto had made his way, now long since  fallen out of use excepting as a burial place of the race.    At another time he clambered up into the loft under the high peaked  roof, where lay numberless forgotten things covered with the dim dust  of years. There a flock of pigeons had made their roost, and flapped  noisily out into the sunlight when he pushed open the door from below.  Here he hunted among the mouldering things of the past until, oh, joy  of joys! in an ancient oaken chest he found a great lot of worm-eaten  books, that had belonged to some old chaplain of the castle in days gone  by. They were not precious and beautiful volumes, such as the Father  Abbot had showed him, but all the same they had their quaint painted  pictures of the blessed saints and angels.    Again, at another time, going into the court-yard, Otto had found  the door of Melchior's tower standing invitingly open, for old Hilda,  Schwartz Carl's wife, had come down below upon some business or other.    Then upon the shaky wooden steps Otto ran without waiting for a second  thought, for he had often gazed at those curious buildings hanging so  far up in the air, and had wondered what they were like. Round and round  and up and up Otto climbed, until his head spun. At last he reached  a landing-stage, and gazing over the edge and down, beheld the stone  pavement far, far below, lit by a faint glimmer of light that entered  through the arched doorway. Otto clutched tight hold of the wooden rail,  he had no thought that he had climbed so far.    Upon the other side of the landing was a window that pierced the thick  stone walls of the tower; out of the window he looked, and then drew  suddenly back again with a gasp, for it was through the outer wall he  peered, and down, down below in the dizzy depths he saw the hard  gray rocks, where the black swine, looking no larger than ants in the  distance, fed upon the refuse thrown out over the walls of the castle.  There lay the moving tree-tops like a billowy green sea, and the coarse  thatched roofs of the peasant cottages, round which crawled the little  children like tiny human specks.    Then Otto turned and crept down the stairs, frightened at the height to  which he had climbed.    At the doorway he met Mother Hilda. \"Bless us,\" she cried, starting back  and crossing herself, and then, seeing who it was, ducked him a courtesy  with as pleasant a smile as her forbidding face, with its little  deep-set eyes, was able to put upon itself.    Old Ursela seemed nearer to the boy than anyone else about the castle,  excepting it was his father, and it was a newfound delight to Otto to  sit beside her and listen to her quaint stories, so different from the  monkish tales that he had heard and read at the monastery.    But one day it was a tale of a different sort that she told him, and one  that opened his eyes to what he had never dreamed of before.    The mellow sunlight fell through the window upon old Ursela, as she sat  in the warmth with her distaff in her hands while Otto lay close to her  feet upon a bear skin, silently thinking over the strange story of a  brave knight and a fiery dragon that she had just told him. Suddenly  Ursela broke the silence.    \"Little one,\" said she, \"thou art wondrously like thy own dear mother;  didst ever hear how she died?\"    \"Nay,\" said Otto, \"but tell me, Ursela, how it was.\"    \"Tis strange,\" said the old woman, \"that no one should have told thee  in all this time.\" And then, in her own fashion she related to him the  story of how his father had set forth upon that expedition in spite of  all that Otto's mother had said, beseeching him to abide at home; how he  had been foully wounded, and how the poor lady had died from her fright  and grief.    Otto listened with eyes that grew wider and wider, though not all with  wonder; he no longer lay upon the bear skin, but sat up with his hands  clasped. For a moment or two after the old woman had ended her story, he  sat staring silently at her. Then he cried out, in a sharp voice, \"And  is this truth that you tell me, Ursela? and did my father seek to rob  the towns people of their goods?\"    Old Ursela laughed. \"Aye,\" said she, \"that he did and many times. Ah!  me, those day's are all gone now.\" And she fetched a deep sigh. \"Then we  lived in plenty and had both silks and linens and velvets besides in the  store closets and were able to buy good wines and live in plenty upon  the best. Now we dress in frieze and live upon what we can get and  sometimes that is little enough, with nothing better than sour beer to  drink. But there is one comfort in it all, and that is that our good  Baron paid back the score he owed the Trutz-Drachen people not only for  that, but for all that they had done from the very first.\"    Thereupon she went on to tell Otto how Baron Conrad had fulfilled the  pledge of revenge that he had made Abbot Otto, how he had watched day  after day until one time he had caught the Trutz-Drachen folk,  with Baron Frederick at their head, in a narrow defile back of the  Kaiserburg; of the fierce fight that was there fought; of how the  Roderburgs at last fled, leaving Baron Frederick behind them wounded; of  how he had kneeled before the Baron Conrad, asking for mercy, and of  how Baron Conrad had answered, \"Aye, thou shalt have such mercy as thou  deservest,\" and had therewith raised his great two-handed sword and laid  his kneeling enemy dead at one blow.    Poor little Otto had never dreamed that such cruelty and wickedness  could be. He listened to the old woman's story with gaping horror, and  when the last came and she told him, with a smack of her lips, how his  father had killed his enemy with his own hand, he gave a gasping cry and  sprang to his feet. Just then the door at the other end of the chamber  was noisily opened, and Baron Conrad himself strode into the room.  Otto turned his head, and seeing who it was, gave another cry, loud and  quavering, and ran to his father and caught him by the hand.    \"Oh, father!\" he cried, \"oh, father! Is it true that thou hast killed a  man with thy own hand?\"    \"Aye,\" said the Baron, grimly, \"it is true enough, and I think me I have  killed many more than one. But what of that, Otto? Thou must get out of  those foolish notions that the old monks have taught thee. Here in the  world it is different from what it is at St. Michaelsburg; here a man  must either slay or be slain.\"    But poor little Otto, with his face hidden in his father's robe, cried  as though his heart would break. \"Oh, father!\" he said, again and again,  \"it cannot be--it cannot be that thou who art so kind to me should have  killed a man with thine own hands.\" Then: \"I wish that I were back  in the monastery again; I am afraid out here in the great wide world;  perhaps somebody may kill me, for I am only a weak little boy and could  not save my own life if they chose to take it from me.\"    Baron Conrad looked down upon Otto all this while, drawing his bushy  eyebrows together. Once he reached out his hand as though to stroke the  boy's hair, but drew it back again.    Turning angrily upon the old woman, \"Ursela,\" said he, \"thou must tell  the child no more such stories as these; he knowest not at all of such  things as yet. Keep thy tongue busy with the old woman's tales that he  loves to hear thee tell, and leave it with me to teach him what becometh  a true knight and a Vuelph.\"    That night the father and son sat together beside the roaring fire in  the great ball. \"Tell me, Otto,\" said the Baron, \"dost thou hate me for  having done what Ursela told thee today that I did?\"    Otto looked for a while into his father's face. \"I know not,\" said he at  last, in his quaint, quiet voice, \"but methinks that I do not hate thee  for it.\"    The Baron drew his bushy brows together until his eyes twinkled out of  the depths beneath them, then of a sudden he broke into a great loud  laugh, smiting his horny palm with a smack upon his thigh.
