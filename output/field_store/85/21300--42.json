Logic, mathematics, physics  disappear in this philosophy, because they are too \"static\"; what is  real is no impulse and movement towards a goal which, like the  rainbow, recedes as we advance, and makes every place different when  it reaches it from what it appeared to be at a distance.    I do not propose to enter upon a technical examination of this  philosophy. I wish only to maintain that the motives and interests  which inspire it are so exclusively practical, and the problems with  which it deals are so special, that it can hardly be regarded as  touching any of the questions that, to my mind, constitute genuine  philosophy.    The predominant interest of evolutionism is in the question of human  destiny, or at least of the destiny of Life. It is more interested in  morality and happiness than in knowledge for its own sake. It must be  admitted that the same may be said of many other philosophies, and  that a desire for the kind of knowledge which philosophy can give is  very rare. But if philosophy is to attain truth, it is necessary first  and foremost that philosophers should acquire the disinterested  intellectual curiosity which characterises the genuine man of science.  Knowledge concerning the future--which is the kind of knowledge that  must be sought if we are to know about human destiny--is possible  within certain narrow limits. It is impossible to say how much the  limits may be enlarged with the progress of science. But what is  evident is that any proposition about the future belongs by its  subject-matter to some particular science, and is to be ascertained,  if at all, by the methods of that science. Philosophy is not a short  cut to the same kind of results as those of the other sciences: if it  is to be a genuine study, it must have a province of its own, and aim  at results which the other sciences can neither prove nor disprove.    Evolutionism, in basing itself upon the notion of _progress_, which is  change from the worse to the better, allows the notion of time, as it  seems to me, to become its tyrant rather than its servant, and thereby  loses that impartiality of contemplation which is the source of all  that is best in philosophic thought and feeling. Metaphysicians, as we  saw, have frequently denied altogether the reality of time. I do not  wish to do this; I wish only to preserve the mental outlook which  inspired the denial, the attitude which, in thought, regards the past  as having the same reality as the present and the same importance as  the future. \"In so far,\" says Spinoza,[6] \"as the mind conceives a  thing according to the dictate of reason, it will be equally affected  whether the idea is that of a future, past, or present thing.\" It is  this \"conceiving according to the dictate of reason\" that I find  lacking in the philosophy which is based on evolution.      IV. GOOD AND EVIL    Mysticism maintains that all evil is illusory, and sometimes maintains  the same view as regards good, but more often holds that all Reality  is good. Both views are to be found in Heraclitus: \"Good and ill are  one,\" he says, but again, \"To God all things are fair and good and  right, but men hold some things wrong and some right.\" A similar  twofold position is to be found in Spinoza, but he uses the word  \"perfection\" when he means to speak of the good that is not merely  human. \"By reality and perfection I mean the same thing,\" he says;[7]  but elsewhere we find the definition: \"By _good_ I shall mean that  which we certainly know to be useful to us.\"[8] Thus perfection  belongs to Reality in its own nature, but goodness is relative to  ourselves and our needs, and disappears in an impartial survey. Some  such distinction, I think, is necessary in order to understand the  ethical outlook of mysticism: there is a lower mundane kind of good  and evil, which divides the world of appearance into what seem to be  conflicting parts; but there is also a higher, mystical kind of good,  which belongs to Reality and is not opposed by any correlative kind of  evil.    It is difficult to give a logically tenable account of this position  without recognising that good and evil are subjective, that what is  good is merely that towards which we have one kind of feeling, and  what is evil is merely that towards which we have another kind of  feeling. In our active life, where we have to exercise choice, and to  prefer this to that of two possible acts, it is necessary to have a  distinction of good and evil, or at least of better and worse. But  this distinction, like everything pertaining to action, belongs to  what mysticism regards as the world of illusion, if only because it is  essentially concerned with time. In our contemplative life, where  action is not called for, it is possible to be impartial, and to  overcome the ethical dualism which action requires. So long as we  remain _merely_ impartial, we may be content to say that both the good  and the evil of action are illusions. But if, as we must do if we have  the mystic vision, we find the whole world worthy of love and worship,  if we see        \"The earth, and every common sight....      Apparell'd in celestial light,\"    we shall say that there is a higher good than that of action, and that  this higher good belongs to the whole world as it is in reality. In  this way the twofold attitude and the apparent vacillation of  mysticism are explained and justified.    The possibility of this universal love and joy in all that exists is  of supreme importance for the conduct and happiness of life, and gives  inestimable value to the mystic emotion, apart from any creeds which  may be built upon it. But if we are not to be led into false beliefs,  it is necessary to realise exactly _what_ the mystic emotion reveals.  It reveals a possibility of human nature--a possibility of a nobler,  happier, freer life than any that can be otherwise achieved. But it  does not reveal anything about the non-human, or about the nature of  the universe in general. Good and bad, and even the higher good that  mysticism finds everywhere, are the reflections of our own emotions on  other things, not part of the substance of things as they are in  themselves. And therefore an impartial contemplation, freed from all  pre-occupation with Self, will not judge things good or bad, although  it is very easily combined with that feeling of universal love which  leads the mystic to say that the whole world is good.    The philosophy of evolution, through the notion of progress, is bound  up with the ethical dualism of the worse and the better, and is thus  shut out, not only from the kind of survey which discards good and  evil altogether from its view, but also from the mystical belief in  the goodness of everything. In this way the distinction of good and  evil, like time, becomes a tyrant in this philosophy, and introduces  into thought the restless selectiveness of action. Good and evil, like  time, are, it would seem, not general or fundamental in the world of  thought, but late and highly specialised members of the intellectual  hierarchy.    Although, as we saw, mysticism can be interpreted so as to agree with  the view that good and evil are not intellectually fundamental, it  must be admitted that here we are no longer in verbal agreement with  most of the great philosophers and religious teachers of the past. I  believe, however, that the elimination of ethical considerations from  philosophy is both scientifically necessary and--though this may seem  a paradox--an ethical advance. Both these contentions must be briefly  defended.    The hope of satisfaction to our more human desires--the hope of  demonstrating that the world has this or that desirable ethical  characteristic--is not one which, so far as I can see, a scientific  philosophy can do anything whatever to satisfy. The difference between  a good world and a bad one is a difference in the particular  characteristics of the particular things that exist in these worlds:  it is not a sufficiently abstract difference to come within the  province of philosophy. Love and hate, for example, are ethical  opposites, but to philosophy they are closely analogous attitudes  towards objects. The general form and structure of those attitudes  towards objects which constitute mental phenomena is a problem for  philosophy, but the difference between love and hate is not a  difference of form or structure, and therefore belongs rather to the  special science of psychology than to philosophy. Thus the ethical  interests which have often inspired philosophers must remain in the  background: some kind of ethical interest may inspire the whole study,  but none must obtrude in the detail or be expected in the special  results which are sought.    If this view seems at first sight disappointing, we may remind  ourselves that a similar change has been found necessary in all the  other sciences. The physicist or chemist is not now required to prove  the ethical importance of his ions or atoms; the biologist is not  expected to prove the utility of the plants or animals which he  dissects. In pre-scientific ages this was not the case. Astronomy, for  example, was studied because men believed in astrology: it was thought  that the movements of the planets had the most direct and important  bearing upon the lives of human beings. Presumably, when this belief  decayed and the disinterested study of astronomy began, many who had  found astrology absorbingly interesting decided that astronomy had too  little human interest to be worthy of study. Physics, as it appears in  Plato's Tim√¶us for example, is full of ethical notions: it is an  essential part of its purpose to show that the earth is worthy of  admiration. The modern physicist, on the contrary,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],[0,"The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#6)"],[1,"guns had begun.    But not there down to that sleepy, retired part of Devon.  There was the  castle built for defence, and existing now as Sir Granby Royland's happy  country home, surrounded by its great estate with many tenants, while  its heir was stretched out there in the sunshine upon his chest, kicking  up his heels, and thinking at that moment that it would not be a bad  amusement to bring up a very long line with a plummet at the end, to  bait it, and then swing it to and fro till he could drop it right out  where the great pike lay, ten or a dozen feet from the drawbridge.    \"I will some day,\" said the boy, half aloud; \"but it's too much trouble  now.\"    He swung himself round and lay there, looking back over the top of the  spacious building, on whose roof he was, right across the now floral old  court-yard, and between the two angle towers, to the wide-spreading  acres of the farms and woodlands which formed his father's estate.    The jackdaws flew about, and began to settle at the corners as he lay so  still and languidly said to himself--    \"Need to lie still; it wouldn't do to slip over backward.  I shouldn't  even go into the moat, for I should come down on those stones.\"    \"Stupid to be in dangerous places,\" he said to himself directly after,  and, rolling over, he let himself down upon the broad seat-like place,  where he could lie and watch the prospect just as well.    \"Rather stupid of me not to come up here oftener,\" he thought.  \"It's a  capital place.  I will ask father to let me have all this old empty  tower to myself.  What's that?  A fight?\"    For there was a sudden rush upward of jackdaws from where they had  blackened the farthest corner tower to the left, and, looking in that  direction as he lay, he saw the reason of the sudden whirr of wings and  outburst of sharp, harsh cries, for there upon the leads, and holding on  by the little turret which covered the door-way of the spiral staircase,  stood Master Pawson.    \"Feels like I do, I suppose,\" thought Roy, as the secretary cast his  eyes round the old building, particularly watchful of the pleasaunce,  but keeping right back by the outer crenelles as if not wishing to be  seen.    At first Roy felt that the secretary saw him, and as his eyes roved on  and he made no sign, the boy's hand went to his pocket in search of his  handkerchief to wave to him.  He did not withdraw it, but lay lazily  watching while the secretary now turned his back and stood gazing right  away.    \"Never saw him do anything of that kind before,\" thought Roy.  \"What's  he looking after?  I shouldn't have thought he had ever been up there in  his life.\"    Roy lay quite still, with his eyes half closed, and all at once the  secretary drew out his white laced handkerchief, wiped his forehead  three times with a good deal of flourish, and returned it, after which  he slowly stepped into the turret opening and backed out of sight.    \"Mind you don't slip,\" said Roy, tauntingly, but quite conscious of the  fact that his words could not be heard.  \"Why, he has gone down like a  bear--backward.  I could run down those stairs as fast as I came up.\"    Perhaps it was the warm sunshine, perhaps it was from laziness, but,  whatever the cause, Roy Royland went off fast asleep, and remained so  for quite a couple of hours, when, starting up wonderingly, and not  quite conscious of the reason why he was there, he looked about him, and  finally over the great parapet, to see the secretary beyond the farther  end of the drawbridge, talking in a very benign way to the old porter,  who stood with bent head listening to his words.    \"Why, it seems only a few moments ago that I saw him on the leads over  his chamber staring out across country, and he must have been down  since, and had a walk.--How time does go when you're snoozing,\" thought  Roy, \"and how stupid it is to go to sleep in the daytime!  I won't do it  again.\"        CHAPTER FOUR.    THE USE OF A SWORD.    Several days passed away, but Lady Royland always put off sending in  search of news, and seemed to be more cheerful, so that Roy soon forgot  his anxiety in the many things he had to think about,--amusements,  studies, and the like.  But he had a few words with his father's old  follower on the subject of the absence of news, one day, when Ben was  busy, as usual, in the armoury.    \"Not heard lately from the master, sir?  Pish, that's nothing; soldiers  have got their swords and pistols to think about, not their pens.  Best  soldiers I ever knew couldn't write at all.  Enough for them to do to  fight.  You'll hear from him some day, and when you do, you'll know as  he has been pretty busy putting the people straight,--more straight than  some on 'em'll like to be, I know.  Sarve 'em right; nobody's a right to  fight agen the king.--Looks right, don't it?\"    He held up an old sword which he had rubbed and polished till it flashed  in the light.    \"Splendid!\" said Roy.  \"Is it sharp?\"    \"Sharp enough to take your head off at one sweep.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said the boy, laughing.    \"Oh, it's true enough, Master Roy.  Here, you stand all quite stiff and  straight, and I'll show you.\"    \"No, thank you, Ben.  Suppose I try it on you.\"    \"There you are, then,\" said the man; \"but I must have one, too, for a  guard.\"    He handed the boy the sword, and took up another waiting to be cleaned  from galling rust, and, throwing himself on guard, he cried--    \"Now then, cut!\"    \"No; too dangerous,\" said Roy.    \"Not a bit, my lad, because you couldn't touch me.\"    \"I could,\" said Roy, \"where I liked.\"    \"Try, then.\"    \"Not with this sharp sword.\"    \"Very well, then, take one of those; they've no more edge than a wooden  one.  It's time you did know how to use a sword, sir.\"    Ben exchanged his glittering blade, too, and once more stood on guard.    \"I won't bother you now about how you ought to stand, sir,\" he said;  \"that'll come when I begin to give you some lessons.  You go just as you  like, and hit where you can.\"    \"No, no,\" said the boy.  \"I don't want to hurt you, Ben.\"    \"Won't hurt me, sir; more likely to hurt yourself.  But do you know  you're standing just as badly as you possibly could? and if I was your  enemy, I could take off your head, either of your ears, or your legs, as  easily as look at you.\"    Roy laughed, but he did not seem to believe the old soldier's assertion,  and, giving his blunt sword a whirl through the air, he cried--    \"Now, then, Ben; which leg shall I cut off?\"    \"Which you like, sir.\"    Roy made a feint at the right leg, and, quickly changing the direction  of his weapon, struck with it softly at the old soldier's left.    \"Tchah!\" cried the old man, as blade met blade, his sword, in the most  effortless way, being edge outward exactly where Roy struck.  \"Why, do  you know, sir, if I'd been in arnest with you, that you would have been  spitted like a cockchafer on a pin before you got your blade round to  cut?\"    \"Not I,\" said the boy, contemptuously.    \"Very well, sir; you'll see.  Now, try again, and cut hard.  Don't let  your blade stop to get a bit of hay and a drop of water on the way, but  give it me quick.\"    \"But I don't want to hurt you, Ben.\"    \"Well, I don't, either; and, what's more, I don't mean to let you.\"    \"But I shall, I'm sure, if I strike hard.\"    \"You think so, my lad; but do you know what a good sword is?\"    \"A sword.\"    \"Yes, and a lot more.  When a man can use it properly, it's a shield,  and a breastplate, helmet, brasses, and everything else.  Now, I'll just  show you.  Helmet, say.  Now, you cut straight down at my head, just as  if you were going to cut me in two pieces.\"    \"Put on one of the old helmets, then.\"    \"Tchah!  I don't want any helmets.  You cut.\"    \"And suppose I hurt you?\"    \"S'pose you can't.\"    \"Well, I don't want to,\" said Roy; \"so look out.\"    \"Right, sir; chop away.\"    Roy raised his sword slowly, and the old soldier dropped the point of  his and began to laugh.    \"That won't do, my lad; lift your blade as if you were going to bring it  down again, not as if you meant to hang it up for an ornament on a peg.\"    \"Oh, very well,\" said Roy.  \"Now, then, I'm going to cut at you sharp.\"    \"Oh, are you, sir?\" said Ben.  \"Now, if ever you're a soldier, and meet  a man who means to kill you, shall you tell him you're going to cut at  him sharply? because, if you do, you'll have his blade through you  before you've half said it.\"    \"You are precious fond of your banter,\" cried Roy, who was a little put  out now.  \"Serve you right if I do hurt you.  But this blade won't cut,  will it?\"    \"Cut through the air if you move it sharp; that's about all, my lad.\"    \"Then take that,\" cried the boy.    _Clang_--_cling_--_clatter_!    Roy stared, for his sword had come in contact with that of the old  soldier, and then was twisted out of his grasp and went rattling along  the floor, Ben going after it to fetch it back.    \"Try again, sir.\"    Roy was on his mettle now, and, grasping the hilt more firmly, he  essayed to deliver a few blows at his opponent's legs, sides, and arms.  But Ben's sword was always there first, and held at such an angle that  his weapon glided off violently, as if from his own strength in  delivering the blow; and, try hard as he could, he could not get near  enough to make one touch.    \"Arms and head, my lad; sharp.\"    Better satisfied now that he would not hurt his adversary, Roy struck  down at the near shoulder, but his sword glanced away.  Then at the  head, the legs, everywhere that seemed to offer for a blow, but always  for his blade to glance off with a harsh grating sound.    \"There, it's of no use; you can't get near me, my lad,\" said Ben, at  last.    \"Oh, yes, I can.  I was afraid of hurting you.  I shall hit hard as  hard,\" cried Roy, who felt nettled.  \"But I don't want to hurt you.  Let's have sticks.\"    \"I'll get sticks directly, sir.  You hit me first with the sword.\""]]]
