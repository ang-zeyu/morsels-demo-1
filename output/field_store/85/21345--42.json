As we see, for the Protestants, thanks to these numerous decrees,  persecution began at the cradle and followed them to the grave.    As a boy, a Huguenot could--enter no public school; as a youth, no  career was open to him; he could become neither mercer nor concierge,  neither apothecary nor physician, neither lawyer nor consul. As a man,  he had no sacred house, of prayer; no registrar would inscribe his  marriage or the birth of his children; hourly his liberty and his  conscience were ignored. If he ventured to worship God by the singing of  psalms, he had to be silent as the Host was carried past outside. When a  Catholic festival occurred, he was forced not only to swallow his rage  but to let his house be hung with decorations in sign of joy; if he had  inherited a fortune from his fathers, having neither social standing nor  civil rights, it slipped gradually out of his hands, and went to support  the schools and hospitals of his foes. Having reached the end of his  life, his deathbed was made miserable; for dying in the faith of his  fathers, he could not be laid to rest beside them, and like a pariah he  would be carried to his grave at night, no more than ten of those near  and dear to him being allowed to follow his coffin.    Lastly, if at any age whatever he should attempt to quit the cruel soil  on which he had no right to be born, to live, or to die, he would be  declared a rebel, his goads would be confiscated, and the lightest  penalty that he had to expect, if he ever fell into the hands of his  enemies, was to row for the rest of his life in the galleys of the king,  chained between a murderer and a forger.    Such a state of things was intolerable: the cries of one man are lost in  space, but the groans of a whole population are like a storm; and this  time, as always, the tempest gathered in the mountains, and the  rumblings of the thunder began to be heard.    First there were texts written by invisible hands on city walls, on the  signposts and cross-roads, on the crosses in the cemeteries: these  warnings, like the 'Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin' of Belshazzar, even  pursued the persecutors into the midst of their feasts and orgies.    Now it was the threat, \"Jesus came not to send peace, but a sword.\" Then  this consolation, \"For where two or three are gathered together in My  name, there am I in the midst of them.\" Or perhaps it was this appeal  for united action which was soon to become a summons to revolt, \"That  which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have  fellowship with us.\"    And before these promises, taken from the New Testament, the persecuted  paused, and then went home inspired by faith in the prophets, who spake,  as St. Paul says in his First Epistle to the Thessalonians, \"not the  word of men but the word of God.\"    Very soon these words became incarnate, and what the prophet Joel  foretold came to pass: \"Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,  your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions,...  and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and  fire,... and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name  of the Lord shall be delivered.\"    In 1696 reports began to circulate that men had had visions; being able  to see what was going on in the most distant parts, and that the heavens  themselves opened to their eyes. While in this ecstatic state they were  insensible to pain when pricked with either pin or blade; and when, on  recovering consciousness, they were questioned they could remember  nothing.    The first of these was a woman from Vivarais, whose origin was unknown.  She went about from town to town, shedding tears of blood. M. de  Baville, intendant of Languedoc, had her arrested and brought to  Montpellier. There she was condemned to death and burnt at the stake,  her tears of blood being dried by fire.    After her came a second fanatic, for so these popular prophets were  called. He was born at Mazillon, his name was Laquoite, and he was  twenty years of age. The gift of prophecy had come to him in a strange  manner. This is the story told about him:--\"One day, returning from  Languedoc, where he had been engaged in the cultivation of silkworms, on  reaching the bottom of the hill of St. Jean he found a man lying on the  ground trembling in every limb. Moved by pity, he stopped and asked what  ailed him. The man replied, 'Throw yourself on your knees, my son, and  trouble not yourself about me, but learn how to attain salvation and  save your brethren. This can only be done by the communion of the Holy  Ghost, who is in me, and whom by the grace of God I can bestow on you.  Approach and receive this gift in a kiss.' At these words the unknown  kissed the young man on the mouth, pressed his hand and disappeared,  leaving the other trembling in his turn; for the spirit of God was in  him, and being inspired he spread the word abroad.\"    A third fanatic, a prophetess, raved about the parishes of St. Andeol de  Clerguemont and St. Frazal de Vantalon, but she addressed herself  principally to recent converts, to whom she preached concerning the  Eucharist that in swallowing the consecrated wafer they had swallowed a  poison as venomous as the head of the basilisk, that they had bent the  knee to Baal, and that no penitence on their part could be great enough  to save them. These doctrines inspired such profound terror that the  Rev. Father Louvreloeil himself tells us that Satan by his efforts  succeeded in nearly emptying the churches, and that at the following  Easter celebrations there were only half as many communicants as the  preceding year.    Such a state of licence, which threatened to spread farther and farther,  awoke the religious solicitude of Messire Francois Langlade de Duchayla,  Prior of Laval, Inspector of Missions of Gevaudan, and Arch-priest of  the Cevennes. He therefore resolved to leave his residence at Mende and  to visit the parishes in which heresy had taken the strongest hold, in  order to oppose it by every mean's which God and the king had put in his  power.    The Abbe Duchayla was a younger son of the noble house of Langlade, and  by the circumstances of his birth, in spite of his soldierly instincts,  had been obliged to leave epaulet and sword to his elder brother, and  himself assume cassock and stole. On leaving the seminary, he espoused  the cause of the Church militant with all the ardour of his temperament.  Perils to encounter; foes to fight, a religion to force on others, were  necessities to this fiery character, and as everything at the moment was  quiet in France, he had embarked for India with the fervent resolution  of a martyr.    On reaching his destination, the young missionary had found himself  surrounded by circumstances which were wonderfully in harmony with his  celestial longings: some of his predecessors had been carried so far by  religious zeal that the King of Siam had put several to death by torture  and had forbidden any more missionaries to enter his dominions; but  this, as we can easily imagine, only excited still more the abbe's  missionary fervour; evading the watchfulness of the military, and  regardless of the terrible penalties imposed by the king, he crossed the  frontier, and began to preach the Catholic religion to the heathen, many  of whom were converted.    One day he was surprised by a party of soldiers in a little village in  which he had been living for three months, and in which nearly all the  inhabitants had abjured their false faith, and was brought before the  governor of Bankan, where instead of denying his faith, he nobly  defended Christianity and magnified the name of God. He was handed over  to the executioners to be subjected to torture, and suffered at their  hands with resignation everything that a human body can endure while yet  retaining life, till at length his patience exhausted their rage; and  seeing him become unconscious, they thought he was dead, and with  mutilated hands, his breast furrowed with wounds, his limbs half warn  through by heavy fetters, he was suspended by the wrists to a branch of  a tree and abandoned. A pariah passing by cut him down and succoured  him, and reports of his martyrdom having spread, the French ambassador  demanded justice with no uncertain voice, so that the King of Siam,  rejoicing that the executioners "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2744"],[0,"Mary Stuart (#6)"],[1,"Edinburgh; which in other  words was as much as to say that Murray should remain exiled in England  for life, since Dumfries was one of the principal frontier towns.    Meanwhile the conspiracy proceeded, and Douglas and Ruthven, having  collected their accomplices and taken their measures, came to Darnley to  finish the compact. As the price of the bloody service they rendered the  king, they exacted from him a promise to obtain the pardon of Murray and  the nobles compromised with him in the affair of the \"run in every  sense\". Darnley granted all they asked of him, and a messenger was sent  to Murray to inform him of the expedition in preparation, and to invite  him to hold himself in readiness to reenter Scotland at the first notice  he should receive. Then, this point settled, they made Darnley sign a  paper in which he acknowledged himself the author and chief of the  enterprise. The other assassins were the Earl of Morton, the Earl of  Ruthven, George Douglas the bastard of Angus, Lindley, and Andrew Carew.  The remainder were soldiers, simple murderers' tools, who did not even  know what was afoot. Darnley reserved it for himself to appoint the  time.    Two days after these conditions were agreed upon, Darnley having been  notified that the queen was alone with Rizzio, wished to make himself  sure of the degree of her favour enjoyed by the minister. He accordingly  went to her apartment by a little door of which he always kept the key  upon him; but though the key turned in the lock, the door did not open.  Then Darnley knocked, announcing himself; but such was the contempt into  which he had fallen with the queen, that Mary left him outside,  although, supposing she had been alone with Rizzio, she would have had  time to send him away. Darnley, driven to extremities by this, summoned  Morton, Ruthven, Lennox, Lindley, and Douglas's bastard, and fixed the  assassination of Rizzio for two days later.    They had just completed all the details, and had, distributed the parts  that each must play in this bloody tragedy, when suddenly, and at the  moment when they least expected it, the door opened and, Mary Stuart  appeared on the threshold.    \"My lords,\" said she, \"your holding these secret counsels is useless. I  am informed of your plots, and with God's help I shall soon apply a  remedy\".    With these words, and before the conspirators had time to collect  themselves, she shut the door again, and vanished like a passing but  threatening vision. All remained thunderstruck. Morton was the first to  find his tongue.    \"My lords,\" said he, \"this is a game of life and death, and the winner  will not be the cleverest or the strongest, but the readiest. If we do  not destroy this man, we are lost. We must strike him down, this very  evening, not the day after to-morrow.\"    Everyone applauded, even Ruthven, who, still pale and feverish from  riotous living, promised not to be behindhand. The only point changed,  on Morton's suggestion, was that the murder should take place next day;  for, in the opinion of all, not less than a day's interval was needed to  collect the minor conspirators, who numbered not less than five hundred.    The next day, which was Saturday, March 9th, 1566, Mary Stuart, who had  inherited from her father, James V, a dislike of ceremony and the need  of liberty, had invited to supper with her six persons, Rizzio among the  number. Darnley, informed of this in the morning, immediately gave  notice of it to the conspirators, telling them that he himself would let  them into the palace between six and seven o'clock in the evening. The  conspirators replied that they would be in readiness.    The morning had been dark and stormy, as nearly all the first days of  spring are in Scotland, and towards evening the snow and wind redoubled  in depth and violence. So Mary had remained shut up with Rizzio, and  Darnley, who had gone to the secret door several times, could hear the  sound of instruments and the voice of the favourite, who was singing  those sweet melodies which have come down to our time, and which  Edinburgh people still attribute to him. These songs were for Mary a  reminder of her stay in France, where the artists in the train of the  Medicis had already brought echoes from Italy; but for Darnley they were  an insult, and each time he had withdrawn strengthened in his design.    At the appointed time, the conspirators, who had been given the password  during the day, knocked at the palace gate, and were received there so  much the more easily that Darnley himself, wrapped in a great cloak,  awaited them at the postern by which they were admitted. The five  hundred soldiers immediately stole into an inner courtyard, where they  placed themselves under some sheds, as much to keep themselves from the  cold as that they might not be seen on the snow-covered ground. A  brightly lighted window looked into this courtyard; it was that of the  queen's study: at the first signal given them from this window, the  soldiers were to break in the door and go to the help of the chief  conspirators.    These instructions given, Darnley led Morton, Ruthven, Lennox, Lindley,  Andrew Carew, and Douglas's bastard into the room adjoining the study,  and only separated from it by a tapestry hanging before the door. From  there one could overhear all that was being said, and at a single bound  fall upon the guests.    Darnley left them in this room, enjoining silence; then, giving them as  a signal to enter the moment when they should hear him cry, \"To me,  Douglas!\" he went round by the secret passage, so that seeing him come  in by his usual door the queen's suspicions might not be roused by his  unlooked-for visit.    Mary was at supper with six persons, having, say de Thou and Melville,  Rizzio seated on her right; while, on the contrary, Carapden assures us  that he was eating standing at a sideboard. The talk was gay and  intimate; for all were giving themselves up to the ease one feels at  being safe and warm, at a hospitable board, while the snow is beating  against the windows and the wind roaring in the chimneys. Suddenly Mary,  surprised that the most profound silence had succeeded to the lively and  animated flow of words among her guests since the beginning of supper,  and suspecting, from their glances, that the cause of their uneasiness  was behind her, turned round and saw Darnley leaning on the back of her  chair. The queen shuddered; for although her husband was smiling when  looking at Rizzio, this smile had assumed such a strange expression that  it was clear that something terrible was about to happen. At the same  moment, Mary heard in the next room a heavy, dragging step draw near the  cabinet, then the tapestry was raised, and Lord Ruthven, in armour of  which he could barely support the weight, pale as a ghost, appeared on  the threshold, and, drawing his sword in silence, leaned upon it.    The queen thought he was delirious.    \"What do you want, my lord?\" she said to him; \"and why do you come to  the palace like this?\"    \"Ask the king, madam,\" replied Ruthven in an indistinct voice. \"It is  for him to answer.\"    \"Explain, my lord,\" Mary demanded, turning again towards Darnley; \"what  does such a neglect of ordinary propriety mean?\"    \"It means, madam,\" returned Darnley, pointing to Rizzio, \"that that man  must leave here this very minute.\"    \"That man is mine, my lord,\" Mary said, rising proudly, \"and  consequently takes orders only from me.\"    \"To me, Douglas!\" cried Darnley.    At these words, the conspirators, who for some moments had drawn nearer  Ruthven, fearing, so changeable was Darnley's character, lest he had  brought them in vain and would not dare to utter the signal--at these  words, the conspirators rushed into the room with such haste that they  overturned the table. Then David Rizzio, seeing that it was he alone  they wanted, threw himself on his knees behind the queen, seizing the  hem of her robe and crying in Italian, \"Giustizia! giustizia!\" Indeed,  the queen, true to her character, not allowing herself to be intimidated  by this terrible irruption, placed herself in front of Rizzio and  sheltered him behind her Majesty. But she counted too much on the  respect of a nobility accustomed to struggle hand to hand with its kings  for five centuries. Andrew Carew held a dagger to her breast and  threatened to kill her if she insisted on defending any longer him whose  death was resolved upon. Then Darnley, without consideration for the  queen's pregnancy, seized her round the waist and bore her away from  Rizzio, who remained on his knees pale and trembling, while Douglas's  bastard, confirming the prediction of the astrologer who had warned  Rizzio to beware of a certain bastard, drawing the king's own dagger,  plunged it into the breast of the minister, who fell wounded, but not  dead. Morton immediately took him by the feet and dragged him from the  cabinet into the larger room, leaving on the floor that long track of  blood which is still shown there; then, arrived there, each rushed upon  him as upon a quarry, and set upon the corpse, which they stabbed in  fifty-six places. Meanwhile Darnley held the queen, who, thinking that  all was not over, did not cease crying for mercy. But Ruthven came back,  paler than at first, and at Darnley's inquiry if Rizzio were dead, he  nodded in the affirmative; then, as he could not bear further fatigue in  his convalescent state, he sat down, although the queen, whom Darnley  had at last released, remained standing on the same spot. At this Mary  could not contain herself.    \"My lord,\" cried she, \"who has given you permission to sit down in my  presence, and whence comes such insolence?\"    \"Madam,\" Ruthven answered, \"I act thus not from insolence, but from  weakness; for, to serve your husband, I have just taken more exercise  than my doctors allow\". Then turning round to a servant, \"Give me a  glass of"]]]
