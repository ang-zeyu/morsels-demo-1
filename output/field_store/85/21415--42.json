He replied, \"What between snuff-box on one side, and  chatterbox on the other, we get on pretty well!\"    Sir Richard Bethel, Lord Westbury, and Lord Campbell were on very  friendly terms. An amusing story is told of a meeting of the two in  Westminster Hall, when the first rumour of Lord Campbell's appointment  as Lord Chancellor was current. The day being cold for the time of the  year, Lord Campbell had gone down to the House of Lords in a fur coat,  and Bethel, observing this, pretended not to recognise him. Thereupon  Campbell came up to him and said: \"Mr. Attorney, don't you know me?\"--\"I  beg your pardon, my lord,\" was the reply. \"I mistook you for the _Great  Seal_.\"    [Illustration: RICHARD BETHEL, BARON WESTBURY, LORD CHANCELLOR.]    Lord Cranworth, Vice-Chancellor, after hearing Sir Richard Bethel's  argument in an appeal, said he \"would turn the matter over in his mind.\"  Sir Richard turning to his junior with his usual bland calm utterance  said: \"Take a note of that; his honour says he will turn it over in what  he is pleased to call his mind.\"    Sir James Scarlett, Lord Abinger, had to examine a witness whose  evidence would be somewhat dangerous unless he was thrown off his guard  and \"rattled.\" The witness in question--an influential man, whose  vulnerable point was said to be his self-esteem--was ushered into the  box, a portly overdressed person, beaming with self-assurance. Looking  him over for a few minutes without saying a word Sir James opened fire:  \"Mr. Tompkins, I believe?\"--\"Yes.\"--\"You are a stockbroker, I believe,  are you not?\"--\"I ham.\" Pausing for a few seconds and making an  attentive survey of him, Sir James remarked sententiously, \"And a very  fine and well-dressed ham you are, sir.\"    In a breach of promise case Scarlett appeared for the defendant, who was  supposed to have been cajoled into the engagement by the plaintiff's  mother, a titled lady. The mother, as a witness, completely baffled the  defendant's clever counsel when under his cross-examination; but by one  of his happiest strokes of advocacy, Scarlett turned his failure into  success. \"You saw, gentlemen of the jury, that I was but a child in her  hands. _What must my client have been?_\"    Sir James was a noted cross-examiner and verdict-getter, but on one  occasion he was beaten. Tom Cooke, a well-known actor and musician in  his day, was a witness in a case in which Sir James had him under  cross-examination.    Scarlett: \"Sir, you say that the two melodies are the same, but  different; now what do you mean by that, sir?\"    Cooke: \"I said that the notes in the two copies are alike, but with a  different accent.\"    Scarlett: \"What is a musical accent?\"    Cooke: \"My terms are nine guineas a quarter, sir.\"    Scarlett (ruffled): \"Never mind your terms here. I ask you what is a  musical accent? Can you see it?\"    Cooke: \"No.\"    Scarlett: \"Can you feel it?\"    Cooke: \"A musician can.\"    Scarlett (angrily): \"Now, sir, don't beat about the bush, but explain to  his lordship and the jury, who are expected to know nothing about music,  the meaning of what you call accent.\"    Cooke: \"Accent in music is a certain stress laid upon a particular note,  in the same manner as you would lay stress upon a given word, for the  purpose of being better understood. For instance, if I were to say, 'You  are an _ass_,' it rests on ass, but if I were to say, '_You_ are an  ass,' it rests on you, Sir James.\" The judge, with as much gravity as he  could assume, then asked the crestfallen counsel, \"Are you satisfied,  Sir James.\"--\"The witness may go down,\" was the counsel's reply.           *       *       *       *       *    Lord Justice Holt, when a young man, was very dissipated, and belonged  to a club, most of whose members took an infamous course of life. When  his lordship was engaged at the Old Baily a man was convicted of highway  robbery, whom the judge remembered to have been one of his early  companions. Moved by curiosity, Holt, thinking the man did not recognise  him, asked what had become of his old associates. The culprit making a  low bow, and giving a deep sigh, replied, \"Oh, my lord, they are all  hanged but your lordship and I.\"    We have already given examples of personalities in the retorts of  counsel upon members of the Bench, and if the same derogatory reflection  can be traced in the two following anecdotes of judges' retorts on  counsel, it is at least veiled in finer sarcasm. A nervous young  barrister was conducting a first case before Vice-Chancellor Bacon, and  on rising to make his opening remarks began in a faint voice: \"My lord,  I must apologise--er--I must apologise, my lord\"--\"Go on, sir,\" said his  lordship blandly; \"so far the Court is with you.\" The other comes from  an Australian Court. Counsel was addressing Chief Justice Holroyd when a  portion of the plaster of the Court ceiling fell, and he stopping his  speech for the moment, incautiously advanced the suggestion, \"Dry rot  has probably been the cause of that, my lord.\"--\"I am quite of your  opinion, Mr. ----,\" observed his lordship.    On the other hand, judges can be severely personal at times, and Lord  Justice Chitty was almost brutal in a case where counsel had been  arguing to distraction on a bill of sale. \"I will now proceed to address  myself to the furniture--an item covered by the bill,\" counsel  continued. \"You have been doing nothing else for the last hour,\"  lamented the weary judge.    And Mr. Justice Wills once made a rather cutting remark to a barrister.  The barrister was, in the judge's private opinion, simply wasting the  time of the Court, and, in the course of a long-winded speech, he dwelt  at quite unnecessary length on the appearance of certain bags connected  with the case. \"They might,\" he went on pompously, \"they might have been  full bags, or they might have been half-filled bags, or they might even  have been empty bags, or--.\"--\"Or perhaps,\" dryly interpolated the  judge, \"they might have been wind-bags!\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: HENRY BROUGHAM, BARON BROUGHAM AND VAUX, LORD  CHANCELLOR.]    When Lord Brougham attained the position of Lord Chancellor he was  greatly addicted to the habit of writing during the course of counsel's  argument of the case being heard before him. On one occasion this  practice so annoyed Sir Edward Sugden, whenever he noticed it, that he  paused in the course of his argument, expecting his lordship to stop  writing; but the Chancellor, without even looking up, remarked, \"Go on,  Sir Edward; I am listening to you.\"--\"I observe that your lordship is  engaged in writing, and not favouring me with your attention,\" replied  Sir Edward. \"I am signing papers of mere form,\" warmly retorted the  Chancellor. \"You may as well say that I am not to blow my nose or take  snuff while you speak.\"    When counsel at the Bar, a witness named John Labron was thus  cross-examined by Brougham at York Assizes:    \"What are you?\"    \"I am a farmer, and malt a little.\"    \"Do you know Dick Strother?\"    \"No.\"    \"Upon your oath, sir, are you not generally known by the name of Dick  Strother?\"    \"That has nothing to do with this business.\"    \"I insist upon hearing an answer. Have you not obtained that name?\"    \"I am sometimes called so.\"    \"Now, Dick, as you admit you are so called, do you know the story of the  hare and the ball of wax?\"    \"I have heard it.\"    \"Then pray have the goodness to relate it to the judge and the jury.\"    \"I do not exactly remember it.\"    \"Then I will refresh your memory by relating it myself. Dick Strother  was a cobbler, and being in want of a hare for a friend, he put in his  pocket a ball of wax and took a walk into the fields, where he soon  espied one. Dick then very dexterously threw the ball of wax at her  head, where it stuck, which so alarmed poor puss that in the violence of  her haste she ran in contact with the head of another; both stuck fast  together, and Dick, lucky Dick! caught both. Dick obtained great  celebrity by telling this wondrous feat, which he always affirmed as a  truth, and from that every notorious liar in Thorner bears the title  of Dick Strother. Now, Dick--I mean John--is not that the reason why you  are called Dick Strother?\"    \"It may be so.\"    \"Then you may go.\"    The same turbulent spirit (Lord Brougham) fell foul of many other law  lords. It is well known that in a speech made at the Temple he accused  Lord Campbell, who had just published his _Lives of the Chancellors_, of  adding a new terror to death. Lord Campbell tells an amusing story which  shows that he could retort with effect upon his noble and learned  friend. He says that he called one morning upon Brougham at his house in  Grafton Street, who \"soon rushed in very eagerly, but suddenly stopped  short, exclaiming, 'Lord bless me, is it you? They told me it was  Stanley'; and notwithstanding his accustomed frank and courteous manner,  I had some difficulty in fixing his attention. In the evening I stepped  across the House to the Opposition Bench, where Brougham and Stanley  were sitting next each other, and, addressing the latter in the hearing  of the former, I said, 'Has our noble and learned friend told you the  disappointment he suffered this morning? He thought he had a visit from  the Leader of the Protectionists to offer him the Great Seal, and it  turned out to be only Campbell come to bore him about a point of Scotch  law.' _Brougham_: 'Don't mind what Jack Campbell says; he has a  prescriptive privilege to tell lies of all Chancellors, dead and  living.'\"    According to the same authority, Brougham was at one time very anxious  to be made an earl, but his desire was entirely quenched when Lord John  Russell gave an earldom to Lord Chancellor Cottenham. He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3003"],[0,"Wild Flowers (#6)"],[1,"furs as if to protect its stems and nodding buds  from cold. After the plebeian skunk cabbage, that ought scarcely  to be reckoned among true flowers - and William Hamilton Gibson  claimed even before it - it is the first blossom to appear.  Winter sunshine, warming the hillsides and edges of woods, opens  its eyes,           \"Blue as the heaven it gates at,      Startling the loiterer in the naked groves      With unexpected beauty; for the time      Of blossoms and green leaves is yet afar.\"    \"There are many things left for May,\" says John Burroughs, \"but  nothing fairer, if as fair, as the first flower, the hepatica. I  find I have never admired this little firstling half enough. When  at the maturity of its charms, it is certainly the gem of the  woods. What an individuality it has! No two clusters alike; all  shades and sizes.... A solitary blue-purple one, fully expanded  and rising over the brown leaves or the green moss, its cluster  of minute anthers showing like a group of pale stars on its  little firmament, is enough to arrest and hold the dullest eye.  Then,...there are individual hepaticas, or individual families  among them, that are sweet scented. The gift seems as capricious  as the gift of genius in families. You cannot tell which the  fragrant ones are till you try them. Sometimes it is the large  white ones, sometimes the large purple ones, sometimes the small  pink ones. The odor is faint and recalls that of the sweet  violets. A correspondent, who seems to have carefully observed  these fragrant hepaticas, writes me that this gift of odor is  constant in the same plant; that the plant which bears  sweet-scented flowers this year will bear them next.\"    It is not evident that insect aid is necessary to transfer the  tiny, hairy spiral ejected from each cell of the antherid, after  it has burst from ripeness, to the canal of the flask-shaped  organ at whose base the germ-cell is located. Perfect flowers can  fertilize themselves. But pollen-feeding flies, and female hive  bees which collect it, and the earliest butterflies trifle about  the blossoms when the first warm days come. Whether they are  rewarded by finding nectar or not is still a mooted question.  Possibly the papillae which cover the receptacle secrete nectar,  for almost without exception the insect visitors thrust their  proboscides down between the spreading filaments as if certain of  a sip. None merely feed on the pollen except the flies and the  hive bee.    The SHARP-LOBED LIVER-LEAF (Hepatica acuta) differs chiefly from  the preceding in having the ends of the lobes of its leaves and  the tips of the three leaflets that form its involucre quite  sharply pointed. Its range, while perhaps not actually more  westerly, appears so, since it is rare in the East, where its  cousin is so abundant; and common in the West, where the  round-lobed liver-leaf is scarce. It blooms in March and April.  Professor Halsted has noted that this species bears staminate  flowers on one plant and pistillate flowers on another; whereas  the Hepatica Hepatica usually bears flowers of both sexes above  the same root. The blossoms, which close at night to keep warm,  and open in the morning, remain on the beautiful plant for a long  time to accommodate the bees and flies that, in this case, are  essential to the perpetuation of the species.      PURPLE VIRGIN'S BOWER    (Atragene Americana)  Crowfoot family    Flowers - Showy, purplish blue, about 3 in. across; 4 sepals,  broadly expanded, thin, translucent, strongly veined, very large,  simulating petals; petals small, spoon-shaped; stamens very  numerous ; styles long, persistent, plumed throughout. Stem:  Trailing or partly climbing with the help of leafstalks and  leaflets. Leaves: Opposite, compounded of 3 egg-shaped, pointed  leaflets on slender petioles.  Preferred Habitat -  - Rocky woodlands.  Flowering Season - May-June.  Distribution - Hudson Bay westward, south to Minnesota and  Virginia.    The day on which one finds this rare and beautiful flower in some  rocky ravine high among the hills or mountains becomes memorable  to the budding botanist. At an elevation of three thousand feet  in the Catskills it trails its way over the rocks, fallen trees,  and undergrowth of the forest, suggesting some of the handsome  Japanese species introduced by Sieboldt and Fortune to Occidental  gardens. No one who sees this broadly expanded blossom could  confuse it either with the thick and bell-shaped purple  LEATHER-FLOWER (C. Viorna), so exquisitely feathery in fruit,  that grows in rich, moist soil from Pennsylvania southward and  westward; or with the far more graceful and deliciously fragrant  purple MARSH CLEMATIS (C. crispa) of our Southern States. The  latter, though bell-shaped also, has thin, recurved sepals, and  its persistent styles are silky, not feathery at seed-time.      ORPINE; LIVE-FOREVER; MIDSUMMER-MEN; LIVE-LONG; PUDDING-BAG  PLANT; GARDEN STONECROP; WITCHES' MONEY    (Sedum Telephium)  Orpine family    Flowers - Dull purplish, very pale or bright reddish purple in  close, round, terminal clusters, each flower 1/3 in. or less  across, 5-parted, the petals twice as long as the sepals; 10  stamens, alternate ones attached to petals; pistils 4 or 5. Stem:  2 ft. high or less, erect, simple, in tufts, very smooth, pale  green, juicy, leafy. Leaves: Alternate, oval, slightly scalloped,  thick, fleshy, smooth, juicy, pale gray green, with stout midrib,  seated on stalk.  Preferred Habitat - Fields, waysides, rocky soil, originally  escaped from gardens.  Flowering Season - June- September.  Distribution - Quebec westward, south to Michigan and Maryland.    Children know the live-forever, not so well by the variable  flower - for it is a niggardly bloomer - as by the thick leaf  that they delight to hold in the mouth until, having loosened the  membrane, they are able to inflate it like a paper bag. Sometimes  dull, sometimes bright, the flower clusters never fail to attract  many insects to their feast, which is accessible even to those of  short tongues. Each blossom is perfect in itself, i.e., it  contains both stamens and pistils; but to guard against  self-fertilization it ripens its anthers and sheds its pollen on  the insects that carry it away to older flowers before its own  stigmas mature and become susceptible to imported pollen. After  the seed-cases take on color, they might be mistaken for  blossoms.    As if the plant did not already possess enough popular names, it  needs must share with the European goldenrod and our common  mullein the title of Aaron's rod. Sedere, to sit, the root of the  generic name, applies with rare appropriateness to this entire  group that we usually find seated on garden walls, rocks, or, in  Europe, even on the roofs of old buildings. Rooting freely from  the joints, our plant forms thrifty tufts where there is little  apparent nourishment; yet its endurance through prolonged drought  is remarkable. Long after the farmer's scythe, sweeping over the  roadside, has laid it low, it thrives on the juices stored up in  fleshy leaves and stem until it proves its title to the most  lusty of all folk names.      PURPLE or WATER AVENS    (Geum rivale)  Rose family    Flowers - Purple, with some orange chrome, 1 in. broad or less,  terminal, solitary, nodding; calyx 5-lobed, purplish, spreading;  5 petals, abruptly narrowed into claws, forming a cup-shaped  corolla; stamens and pistils of indefinite number; the styles,  jointed and bent in middle, persistent, feathery below. Stem: 1  to 2 ft. high, erect, simple or nearly so, hairy, from thickish  rootstock. Leaves: Chiefly from root, on footstems; lower leaves  irregularly parted; the side segments usually few and small; the  1 to 3 terminal segments sharply, irregularly lobed; the few  distant stem leaves 3-foliate or simple, mostly seated on stem.  Fruit: A dry, hairy head stalked in calyx.  Preferred Habitat - Swamps and low, wet ground.  Flowering Season - May-July.  Distribution - Newfoundland far westward, south to Colorado,  eastward to Missouri and Pennsylvania, also northern parts of Old  World.    Mischievous bumblebees, thrusting their long tongues between the  sepals and petals of these unopened flowers, steal nectar without  conferring any favor in return. Later, when they behave properly  and put their heads inside to feast at the disk on which the  stamens are inserted, they dutifully carry pollen from old  flowers to the early maturing stigmas of younger ones.  Self-fertilization must occur, however, if the bees have not  removed all the pollen when a blossom closes. When the purple  avens opens in Europe, the bees desert even the primrose to feast  upon its abundant nectar. Since water is the prime necessity in  the manufacture of this sweet, and since insects that feed upon  it have so much to do with the multiplication of flowers, it is  not surprising that the swamp, which has been called \"nature's  sanctuary,\" should have its altars so exquisitely decked. This  blossom hangs its head, partly to protect its precious nectar  from rain, and partly to make pilfering well nigh impossible to  the unwelcome crawling insect that may have braved the forbidding  hairy stems.      WILD LUPINE; OLD MAID'S BONNETS; WILD PEA; SUN DIAL    (Lupinus perennis)  Pea family    Flowers - Vivid blue, very rarely pink or white, butterfly-shaped  corolla consisting of standard, wings, and keel; about 1/2 in.  long, borne in a long raceme at end of stern; calyx 2-lipped,  deeply toothed. Stem: Erect, branching, leafy, to 2 ft. high.  Leaves: Palmnate, compounded of from 7 to 11 (usually 8)  leaflets. Fruit: A broad, flat, very hairy pod, 1 1/2 in. long,  and containing 4 or 5 seeds.  Preferred Habitat - Dry, sandy places, banks, and hillsides.  Flowering Season - May-June.  Distribution - United States east of Mississippi, and eastern  Canada.    Farmers once thought that this plant preyed upon"]]]
