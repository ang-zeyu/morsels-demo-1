Upon the whole,  a man that will peruse this history, may principally learn from it, that  all events succeed well, even to an incredible degree, and the reward of  felicity is proposed by God; but then it is to those that follow his  will, and do not venture to break his excellent laws: and that so far as  men any way apostatize from the accurate observation of them, what was  practical before becomes impracticable 5 and whatsoever they set about  as a good thing, is converted into an incurable calamity. And now I  exhort all those that peruse these books, to apply their minds to God;  and to examine the mind of our legislator, whether he hath not  understood his nature in a manner worthy of him; and hath not ever  ascribed to him such operations as become his power, and hath not  preserved his writings from those indecent fables which others have  framed, although, by the great distance of time when he lived, he might  have securely forged such lies; for he lived two thousand years ago; at  which vast distance of ages the poets themselves have not been so hardy  as to fix even the generations of their gods, much less the actions of  their men, or their own laws. As I proceed, therefore, I shall  accurately describe what is contained in our records, in the order of  time that belongs to them; for I have already promised so to do  throughout this undertaking; and this without adding any thing to what  is therein contained, or taking away any thing therefrom.    4. But because almost all our constitution depends on the wisdom of  Moses, our legislator, I cannot avoid saying somewhat concerning him  beforehand, though I shall do it briefly; I mean, because otherwise  those that read my book may wonder how it comes to pass, that my  discourse, which promises an account of laws and historical facts,  contains so much of philosophy. The reader is therefore to know, that  Moses deemed it exceeding necessary, that he who would conduct his own  life well, and give laws to others, in the first place should consider  the Divine nature; and, upon the contemplation of God's operations,  should thereby imitate the best of all patterns, so far as it is  possible for human nature to do, and to endeavor to follow after it:  neither could the legislator himself have a right mind without such a  contemplation; nor would any thing he should write tend to the promotion  of virtue in his readers; I mean, unless they be taught first of all,  that God is the Father and Lord of all things, and sees all things, and  that thence he bestows a happy life upon those that follow him; but  plunges such as do not walk in the paths of virtue into inevitable  miseries. Now when Moses was desirous to teach this lesson to his  countrymen, he did not begin the establishment of his laws after the  same manner that other legislators did; I mean, upon contracts and other  rights between one man and another, but by raising their minds upwards  to regard God, and his creation of the world; and by persuading them,  that we men are the most excellent of the creatures of God upon earth.  Now when once he had brought them to submit to religion, he easily  persuaded them to submit in all other things: for as to other  legislators, they followed fables, and by their discourses transferred  the most reproachful of human vices unto the gods, and afforded wicked  men the most plausible excuses for their crimes; but as for our  legislator, when he had once demonstrated that God was possessed of  perfect virtue, he supposed that men also ought to strive after the  participation of it; and on those who did not so think, and so believe,  he inflicted the severest punishments. I exhort, therefore, my readers  to examine this whole undertaking in that view; for thereby it will  appear to them, that there is nothing therein disagreeable either to the  majesty of God, or to his love to mankind; for all things have here a  reference to the nature of the universe; while our legislator speaks  some things wisely, but enigmatically, and others under a decent  allegory, but still explains such things as required a direct  explication plainly and expressly. However, those that have a mind to  know the reasons of every thing, may find here a very curious  philosophical theory, which I now indeed shall wave the explication of;  but if God afford me time for it, I will set about writing it 6 after I  have finished the present work. I shall now betake myself to the history  before me, after I have first mentioned what Moses says of the creation  of the world, which I find described in the sacred books after the  manner following.

Containing The Interval Of Three Thousand Eight Hundred And  Thirty-Three Years. Â— From The Creation To The Death Of Isaac.              CHAPTER 1. The Constitution Of The World And The Disposition Of The  Elements.    1. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. But when the  earth did not come into sight, but was covered with thick darkness, and  a wind moved upon its surface, God commanded that there should be light:  and when that was made, he considered the whole mass, and separated the  light and the darkness; and the name he gave to one was Night, and the  other he called Day: and he named the beginning of light, and the time  of rest, The Evening and The Morning, and this was indeed the first day.  But Moses said it was one day; the cause of which I am able to give even  now; but because I have promised to give such reasons for all things in  a treatise by itself, I shall put off its exposition till that time.  After this, on the second day, he placed the heaven over the whole  world, and separated it from the other parts, and he determined it  should stand by itself. He also placed a crystalline [firmament] round  it, and put it together in a manner agreeable to the earth, and fitted  it for giving moisture and rain, and for affording the advantage of  dews. On the third day he appointed the dry land to appear, with the sea  itself round about it; and on the very same day he made the plants and  the seeds to spring out of the earth. On the fourth day he adorned the  heaven with the sun, the moon, and the other stars, and appointed them  their motions and courses, that the vicissitudes of the seasons might be  clearly signified. And on the fifth day he produced the living  creatures, both those that swim, and those that fly; the former in the  sea, the latter in the air: he also sorted them as to society and  mixture, for procreation, and that their kinds might increase and  multiply. On the sixth day he created the four-footed beasts, and made  them male and female: on the same day he also formed man. Accordingly  Moses says, That in just six days the world, and all that is therein,  was made. And that the seventh day was a rest, and a release from the  labor of such operations; whence it is that we Celebrate a rest from our  labors on that day, and call it the Sabbath, which word denotes rest in  the Hebrew tongue.    2. Moreover, Moses, after the seventh day was over1 begins to talk  philosophically; and concerning the formation of man, says thus: That  God took dust from the ground, and formed man, and inserted in him a  spirit and a soul.2 This man was called Adam, which in the Hebrew tongue  signifies one that is red, because he was formed out of red earth,  compounded together; for of that kind is virgin and true earth. God also  presented the living creatures, when he had made them, according to  their kinds, both male and female, to Adam, who gave them those names by  which they are still called. But when he saw that Adam had no female  companion, no society, for there was no such created, and that he  wondered at the other animals which were male and female, he laid him  asleep, and took away one of his ribs, and out of it formed the woman;  whereupon Adam knew her when she was brought to him, and acknowledged  that she was made out of himself. Now a woman is called in the Hebrew  tongue"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#6)"],[1,"the eighteenth year of  his reign, laid our temple desolate, and so it lay in that state of  obscurity for fifty years; but that in the second year of the reign of  Cyrus its foundations were laid, and it was finished again in the second  year of Darius. I will now add the records of the Phoenicians; for it  will not be superfluous to give the reader demonstrations more than  enough on this occasion. In them we have this enumeration of the times  of their several kings: \"Nabuchodonosor besieged Tyre for thirteen years  in the days of Ithobal, their king; after him reigned Baal, ten years;  after him were judges appointed, who judged the people: Ecnibalus, the  son of Baslacus, two months; Chelbes, the son of Abdeus, ten months;  Abbar, the high priest, three months; Mitgonus and Gerastratus, the sons  of Abdelemus, were judges six years; after whom Balatorus reigned one  year; after his death they sent and fetched Merbalus from Babylon, who  reigned four years; after his death they sent for his brother Hirom, who  reigned twenty years. Under his reign Cyrus became king of Persia.\" So  that the whole interval is fifty-four years besides three months; for  in the seventh year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar he began to besiege  Tyre, and Cyrus the Persian took the kingdom in the fourteenth year of  Hirom. So that the records of the Chaldeans and Tyrians agree with our  writings about this temple; and the testimonies here produced are an  indisputable and undeniable attestation to the antiquity of our nation.  And I suppose that what I have already said may be sufficient to such as  are not very contentious.    22. But now it is proper to satisfy the inquiry of those that disbelieve  the records of barbarians, and think none but Greeks to be worthy of  credit, and to produce many of these very Greeks who were acquainted  with our nation, and to set before them such as upon occasion have made  mention of us in their own writings. Pythagoras, therefore, of Samos,  lived in very ancient times, and was esteemed a person superior to all  philosophers in wisdom and piety towards God. Now it is plain that  he did not only know our doctrines, but was in very great measure a  follower and admirer of them. There is not indeed extant any writing  that is owned for his [15] but many there are who have written his  history, of whom Hermippus is the most celebrated, who was a person very  inquisitive into all sorts of history. Now this Hermippus, in his first  book concerning Pythagoras, speaks thus: \"That Pythagoras, upon the  death of one of his associates, whose name was Calliphon, a Crotonlate  by birth, affirmed that this man's soul conversed with him both night  and day, and enjoined him not to pass over a place where an ass had  fallen down; as also not to drink of such waters as caused thirst again;  and to abstain from all sorts of reproaches.\" After which he adds thus:  \"This he did and said in imitation of the doctrines of the Jews and  Thracians, which he transferred into his own philosophy.\" For it is very  truly affirmed of this Pythagoras, that he took a great many of the laws  of the Jews into his own philosophy. Nor was our nation unknown of  old to several of the Grecian cities, and indeed was thought worthy  of imitation by some of them. This is declared by Theophrastus, in his  writings concerning laws; for he says that \"the laws of the Tyrians  forbid men to swear foreign oaths.\" Among which he enumerates some  others, and particularly that called Corban: which oath can only be  found among the Jews, and declares what a man may call \"A thing devoted  to God.\" Nor indeed was Herodotus of Halicarnassus unacquainted with our  nation, but mentions it after a way of his own, when he saith thus, in  the second book concerning the Colchians. His words are these: \"The only  people who were circumcised in their privy members originally, were the  Colchians, the Egyptians, and the Ethiopians; but the Phoenicians and  those Syrians that are in Palestine confess that they learned it from  the Egyptians. And for those Syrians who live about the rivers Thermodon  and Parthenius, and their neighbors the Macrones, they say they have  lately learned it from the Colchians; for these are the only people that  are circumcised among mankind, and appear to have done the very same  thing with the Egyptians. But as for the Egyptians and Ethiopians  themselves, I am not able to say which of them received it from the  other.\" This therefore is what Herodotus says, that \"the Syrians that  are in Palestine are circumcised.\" But there are no inhabitants of  Palestine that are circumcised excepting the Jews; and therefore it must  be his knowledge of them that enabled him to speak so much concerning  them. Cherilus also, a still ancienter writer, and a poet, [16] makes  mention of our nation, and informs us that it came to the assistance of  king Xerxes, in his expedition against Greece. For in his enumeration of  all those nations, he last of all inserts ours among the rest, when he  says, \"At the last there passed over a people, wonderful to be beheld;  for they spake the Phoenician tongue with their mouths; they dwelt in  the Solymean mountains, near a broad lake: their heads were sooty;  they had round rasures on them; their heads and faces were like nasty  horse-heads also, that had been hardened in the smoke.\" I think,  therefore, that it is evident to every body that Cherilus means us,  because the Solymean mountains are in our country, wherein we inhabit,  as is also the lake called Asphaltitis; for this is a broader and  larger lake than any other that is in Syria: and thus does Cherilus make  mention of us. But now that not only the lowest sort of the Grecians,  but those that are had in the greatest admiration for their philosophic  improvements among them, did not only know the Jews, but when they  lighted upon any of them, admired them also, it is easy for any one to  know. For Clearchus, who was the scholar of Aristotle, and inferior  to no one of the Peripatetics whomsoever, in his first book concerning  sleep, says that \"Aristotle his master related what follows of a Jew,\"  and sets down Aristotle's own discourse with him. The account is this,  as written down by him: \"Now, for a great part of what this Jew said, it  would be too long to recite it; but what includes in it both wonder and  philosophy it may not be amiss to discourse of. Now, that I may be plain  with thee, Hyperochides, I shall herein seem to thee to relate wonders,  and what will resemble dreams themselves. Hereupon Hyperochides answered  modestly, and said, For that very reason it is that all of us are very  desirous of hearing what thou art going to say. Then replied Aristotle,  For this cause it will be the best way to imitate that rule of the  Rhetoricians, which requires us first to give an account of the man,  and of what nation he was, that so we may not contradict our master's  directions. Then said Hyperochides, Go on, if it so pleases thee.  This man then, [answered Aristotle,] was by birth a Jew, and came from  Celesyria; these Jews are derived from the Indian philosophers; they are  named by the Indians Calami, and by the Syrians Judaei, and took their  name from the country they inhabit, which is called Judea; but for  the name of their city, it is a very awkward one, for they call it  Jerusalem. Now this man, when he was hospitably treated by a great many,  came down from the upper country to the places near the sea, and became  a Grecian, not only in his language, but in his soul also; insomuch that  when we ourselves happened to be in Asia about the same places whither  he came, he conversed with us, and with other philosophical persons, and  made a trial of our skill in philosophy; and as he had lived with many  learned men, he communicated to us more information than he received  from us.\" This is Aristotle's account of the matter, as given us by  Clearchus; which Aristotle discoursed also particularly of the great  and wonderful fortitude of this Jew in his diet, and continent way of  living, as those that please may learn more about him from Clearchus's  book itself; for I avoid setting down any more than is sufficient for  my purpose. Now Clearchus said this by way of digression, for his main  design was of another nature. But for Hecateus of Abdera, who was both a  philosopher, and one very useful ill an active life, he was contemporary  with king Alexander in his youth, and afterward was with Ptolemy, the  son of Lagus; he did not write about the Jewish affairs by the by only,  but composed an entire book concerning the Jews themselves; out of  which book I am willing to run over a few things, of which I have been  treating by way of epitome. And, in the first place, I will demonstrate  the time when this Hecateus lived; for he mentions the fight that  was between Ptolemy and Demetrius about Gaza, which was fought in the  eleventh year after the death of Alexander, and in the hundred and  seventeenth olympiad, as Castor says in his history. For when he had set  down this olympiad, he says further, that \"in this olympiad Ptolemy, the  son of Lagus, beat in battle Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, who was  named Poliorcetes, at Gaza.\" Now, it is agreed by all, that Alexander  died in the hundred and fourteenth olympiad; it is therefore evident  that our nation flourished in his time, and in the time of Alexander.  Again, Hecateus says to the same purpose, as follows: \"Ptolemy got  possession of the places in Syria after that battle at Gaza; and many,  when they heard of Ptolemy's moderation and humanity, went along with  him to Egypt, and were willing to assist him in his affairs; one of whom  [Hecateus says] was Hezekiah [17] the high priest of the Jews; a man of  about sixty-six years of age, and in great dignity among his own people.  He was a very sensible man, and could speak very movingly, and was very  skillful in the"]]]
