He is out sight-seeing _all_ day, and enchanted with  everything. I hope that you will persuade the King to come all  the same in September. Our _motives_ and politics are _not_ to be  exclusive, but to be on good terms with _all_, and why should we not?  We make no secret of it.    Now I must end this very long letter. Ever your devoted Niece,    VICTORIA R.    You will kindly not _speak_ of these details, but only in _allgemein_  say the visit went off very satisfactorily on _both sides_, and that  it was _highly pacific_.        [Footnote 15: In honour of the Emperor a Review was held in      Windsor Great Park.]        [Footnote 16: At Ascot.]        [Footnote 17: Given by the Duke of Devonshire.]        [Footnote 18: See _ante_, p. 12.]          [Pageheading: A PARLIAMENTARY CRISIS]    [Pageheading: THE KING OF SAXONY]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    BUCKINGHAM PALACE, _18th June 1844._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had the happiness of receiving your dear and kind  letter of the 13th on Sunday; your _parties_ at Ardenne must have been  truly delightful; perhaps some day _we_ may enjoy them too: that would  be delightful! I can write to you with a light heart, thank goodness,  to-day, for the Government obtained a majority, which _up_ to the  _last_ moment last night we feared they would not have, and we have  been in sad trouble for the last four or five days about it.[19] It  is the more marvellous, as, if the Government asked for a _Vote_  of Confidence, they would have a _Majority_ of 100; but this very  strength makes the supporters of the Government act in a _most_  unjustifiable manner by continually acting and voting against them,  _not_ listening to the debates, but coming down and voting against the  Government. So that we were really in the greatest _possible_ danger  of having a resignation of the Government _without knowing to whom to  turn_, and this from the recklessness of a handful of foolish _half_  \"Puseyite\" half \"Young England\"[20] people! I am sure you will agree  with me that Peel's resignation would not only be for us (for _we  cannot_ have a better and a _safer_ Minister), but for the whole  country, and for the peace of Europe--a _great calamity_. Our present  people are all _safe_, and not led away by impulses and reckless  passions. We must, however, take care and not get into another crisis;  for I assure you we have been quite miserable and _quite_ alarmed ever  since Saturday.    Since I last wrote to you, I spoke to Aberdeen (whom I should be  equally sorry to lose, as he is so _very fair_, and has served _us  personally_, so kindly and truly), and he told me that the Emperor has  _positively pledged_ himself to send a Minister to Brussels the moment  those Poles are no longer employed;[21] that he is quite aware of  the importance of the measure, and would be disposed to make the  arrangement easy, and that he spoke very kindly of _you_ personally.  Aberdeen says it is not necessary to disgrace them in any way, but  only for the present _de les eloigner_. The Emperor has evidently some  time ago made some strong declaration on the subject which he feels  he cannot get over, and, as I said before, he will not give up what he  has once pledged his word to. _Then, no one_ on earth _can_ move him.  _Au fond_, it is a fine _trait_, but he carries it too far. He wrote  me a _very_ kind and affectionate letter from the Hague. The Emperor  has given Bertie the Grand Cross of St Andrew, which the boy was quite  proud of.    Our kind and good King of Saxony leaves us to-morrow, after having  seen more than anybody has done almost, and having enjoyed it of all  things. He is quite at home with us and the children, whom he plays  with much. Alice walks quite alone, and looks too funny, as she is so  _very_ fat. Now, ever your devoted Niece,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 19: The Ministry had been defeated on Mr P. Miles's      motion in favour of giving an increased preference to colonial      sugar, but on the 17th this vote was rescinded by a majority      of twenty-two, Mr Disraeli taunting the Premier with expecting      that \"upon every division and at every crisis, his gang should      appear, and the whip should sound.\"]        [Footnote 20: The name given to the group comprising Disraeli,      George Smythe, Lord John Manners, etc. See _Coningsby_, which      was published about this time.]        [Footnote 21: See _ante_, p. 15.]          _Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._    SOUTH STREET, _19th June 1844._    Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and thanks  your Majesty much for the letter of the 14th inst. Lord Melbourne was  very glad to have the opportunity of seeing the Emperor of Russia at  Chiswick. Lord Melbourne humbly believes that the opinion, which your  Majesty has formed and expresses of the Emperor's character is just,  and he considers it extremely fortunate that a sovereign of such  weight and influence in Europe, and with whom it is probable that  Great Britain will have such near and intimate relations, should also  be a man upon whose honour and veracity strong reliance may be safely  and securely placed.    Lord Melbourne is very glad to believe that the late political  movements, with which the public mind has been agitated, have  subsided, and are entirely terminated by the last vote of the House  of Commons, and by the determination evinced to support the  Administration.[22]    This finishes for the present a business which at one moment seemed  likely to be troublesome, and out of which there did not appear to  present itself any hope or practicable escape.    Lord Melbourne will not make any observation upon what is known and  understood to have passed, further than to say that, as far as he is  acquainted with the history of public affairs in this country, it is  an entire novelty, quite new and unprecedented.[23] Many a Minister  has said to the Crown, \"My advice must be taken, and my measures  must be adopted,\" but no Minister has ever yet held this language or  advanced this pretension to either House of Parliament. However, it  seems to be successful at present, and success will justify much.  Whether it will tend to permanent strength or a steady conduct of  public affairs, remains to be seen.    Lord Melbourne begs to be respectfully remembered to His Royal  Highness.

By Lord  Ellenborough's advice, letters were immediately despatched by express  to every important native Court to assure the native Princes that this  change in the person at the head of the Government would effect no  change in its policy, and Lord Ellenborough himself wrote in similar  terms to the British Representatives at the several Courts.... Lord  Ellenborough has written a letter to the Earl of Ripon with reference  to the reasons alleged by the Court of Directors for his removal  from office, to which letter he most humbly solicits your Majesty's  favourable and attentive consideration. It treats of matters deeply  affecting the good government of India.    Amidst all the difficulties with which he has had to contend in India,  aggravated as they have been by the constant hostility of the Court of  Directors, Lord Ellenborough has ever been sustained by the knowledge  that he was serving a most gracious Mistress, who would place the most  favourable construction upon his conduct, and he now humbly tenders to  your Majesty the expression of his gratitude, not only for those marks  of Royal favour with which it has been intimated to him that it is  your Majesty's intention to reward his services, but yet more for that  constant support which has animated all his exertions, and has mainly  enabled him to place India in the hands of his successor in a state  of universal peace, the result of two years of victories, and in a  condition of prosperity heretofore unknown.          [Pageheading: ENGLAND, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA]      _The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._    LAEKEN, _28th June 1844._    MY BELOVED VICTORIA,--I have again to offer my warmest and best thanks  for a very long and kind letter. I am truly and sincerely happy that  a Ministerial crisis has been spared you; it is in all constitutional  concerns an _awful_ business; but in such a colossal machinery as the  British Empire, it shakes the whole globe. For your sake, for the  good of England, and for the quiet of the whole earth, we must most  devoutly pray that _Sir Robert may remain for many, many years your  trusty and faithful Minister._ Parliaments and Chambers are  extremely fond of governing, particularly as long as it does not bore  themselves. We have had an instance of it recently. I was anxious  to keep the Chamber longer, as there are still many important things  which it ought to have finished; but they were hot, they got tired,  voted twelve _projets de loi_ in one day, and disappeared afterwards,  leaving one the trouble of managing the affairs of the State as best  one may....    As a general political event, the Emperor's visit in England can only  be useful; it is probable that he would _not_ have made the visit if  another had not been talked of. His policy is naturally to _separate_  as much as possible the two great Western Powers; he is too weak to  resist single-handed their dictates in the Oriental question; _but if  they act not in concert_, it is evident that _he is the master_; in  all this he acts"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24790"],[0,"Early English Meals and Manners (#6)"],[1,"Society:--      ORIGINAL SERIES.    _The Earliest English Prose Psalter_, ed.
