She is dressed in the  latest fashion and with killing effect--muslin, silk, embroidery,  chains, bracelets, laces, ribbons, the newest thing in bonnets, and the  last in parasols--and has quite the air of a fine lady. He is a burly  rough, bearded to the eyes, the shapeless remnant of a coarse  wide-awake covering a head of hair that has seemingly been long unknown  to the barber; his blue flannel shirt, ragged jacket, breeches, and long  riding-boots, are all crusted deep with mud, while a stock-whip is  coiled round his shoulders. They walk amicably along together,  conversing, though there is something of an air of constraint between  them. Our colonial friend nods to the man as they pass; and we ask him  who the strangely assorted couple may be.    \"Oh! he's a well-to-do stock-farmer,\" is the reply, \"and has just come  in with a herd of fat beasts.\"    \"And the lady?\" we ask.    \"The lady! Ha! That's a new dairy-maid and house-servant my friend's  just engaged. Guess she'll have to leave her fine feathers in Auckland!  Precious little good they'd be to her at his place in the bush!\"    And now for a sample of the native race, but very sparingly represented  in the city at any time. A dignified and portly gentleman is rolling  along, with an air as though the place belonged to him. He is a Maori,  as we plainly see; moreover, he is a chief, and is at present a member  of the House of Representatives. There is no trace of the savage about  him, as he struts along in his patent leather boots, shining broadcloth,  snowy shirt-front, massive watch-guard, and glossy silk hat, unless it  be in the richly decorative tattoo that adorns his brown face, and over  which a gold double-eyeglass has a somewhat incongruous effect    There is another Maori on the curbstone, looking a horrible  tatterdemalion as he stands there in the scantiest and wretchedest of  European rags, offering peaches and water-melons for sale. Him and his  proffered wares the chief waves off with aristocratic hauteur, until he  suddenly recollects that his humble countryman has a vote at the  elections; then he stops, enters into a brief conversation, examines the  kitful of fruit through his glasses with supercilious disdain, but  eventually purchases a chunk of melon, and goes on his way munching it.    In the shops the same sense of equality is noticeable. Shopkeepers and  their assistants are not the cringing, obsequious slaves that we know so  well in England. There is none of that bowing and smirking, superfluous  \"sir\"-ing and \"ma'am\"-ing, and elaborate deference to customers that  prevails at home. Here we are all freemen and equals; and the Auckland  shopman meets his customer with a shake of the hand, and a pleasant  hail-fellow-well-met style of manner. Not but what all the tricks of  trade are fully understood at the Antipodes, and the Aucklander can  chaffer and haggle, and drive as hard a bargain as his fellow across  the seas; only his way of doing it is different, that is all.    Auckland possesses a class whose members are akin to the street-arabs of  London and elsewhere, but differ from them in many respects. The  Auckland \"larrikin\" is a growing nuisance, but he is neither so numerous  nor so objectionable as yet as his fellow in Melbourne and Sydney.  Unlike the street-arab, he is either a school-boy, or earns his living  somehow, or he is a truant from work of either kind. He probably belongs  to some working family, whom he favours with his company only at such  times as pleases himself, for he is utterly unmanageable by his parents.  He has exuberant spirits and an inordinate love of mischief, which shows  itself in manifold ways. He has a sort of organization of his own, and  seems to revel in uncurbed liberty of action. Occasionally some wrathful  citizen executes summary justice upon him, in spite of the fear that  such an act may bring down the vengeance of the whole boyish gang; and  sometimes the youth finds himself in the police-court, charged with  \"larrikinism,\" an offence that is sure to be severely punished. The  \"larrikin\" easily gets a job, and works by fits and starts when it suits  him, or when he wants money. He lives in the open air, sleeping  anywhere, and getting his food no one knows how. He is not altogether  bad--not so frequently thieving and breaking the law, as intent on  simple mischief and practical jokes of the coarsest and roughest  sort--still, he is a pest that Aucklanders inveigh heartily against, and  would gladly see extirpated by the strong arm of the law.    We turn out of Queen Street into Shortland Crescent. At the corner is a  large and handsome block of buildings constructed of brick, and having  an imposing frontage on the Crescent. This contains the General  Post-office and the Custom House. Not far distant, on the opposite side  of Queen Street, is the New Zealand Insurance Company's establishment,  more generally known as \"The Exchange.\" It is the finest building in the  city, excepting the Supreme Court, perhaps, and has a tower, and a clock  which is the Big Ben of Auckland.    At the corner of Shortland Crescent and Queen Street, and just under the  front of the Post-office, is a kind of rendezvous that serves as a  _Petite Bourse_, or Cornhill, to those who go \"on 'Change\" in Auckland.  Here congregate little knots of eager-eyed men--stock-jobbers most of  them--waiting for news from the Thames gold field, perhaps, or for  telegrams from elsewhere. Ever and anon some report spreads among them,  there is an excited flutter, mysterious consultations and references to  note books, and scrip of the \"Union Beach,\" the \"Caledonian,\" or the  \"Golden Crown,\" changes hands, and goes \"up\" or \"down,\" as the case may  be, while fortunes--in a small way--are made or marred.    Toiling on up the steep ascent of the Crescent, we come out on a broad  road that runs along the summit of the range, and close to an ugly  church, St. Matthew's, that crowns the bluff looking over the harbour.  From various points here there are good views of the city obtainable;  and our guide is able to expatiate on most of its beauties and  characteristics. Down below us is the splendid and extensive harbour,  land-locked, and capable of containing the whole British navy. Right  opposite is the North Head, or North Shore, as it is usually termed, on  whose twin volcanic peaks is an Armstrong battery, to defend the harbour  entrance in case of need. There is also the signal station on Mount  Victoria, whence incoming vessels may be sighted outside of Tiri-tiri  and the Barrier Islands. There are the villages of Stokes' Point, West  Devonport, and East Devonport beyond, facing the open Pacific, and  renowned for its salubrious sea-breezes.    Just beneath us is the railway station, whence the line runs across the  isthmus, connecting Auckland with Onehunga on the Manukau Harbour,  where the West Coast traffic is carried on, and thus placing Auckland,  like Corinth, upon two seas. The railway also extends southwards to the  Waikato.[1] Onehunga is only some half-dozen miles from the outskirts of  the city, and the road to it lies between fields and meadows, bordered  with hedgerows, by villa and cottage and homestead, quite in English  rural style. The road also leads by Ellerslie race-course, and the  Ellerslie Gardens, the Auckland Rosherville.    The coastal traffic that is carried on in the Manukau is nearly equal in  extent to the similar trade done in the Waitemata, hence the commercial  importance of Auckland can hardly be rivalled by that of any other city  of New Zealand. Dunedin, in the far south, holds a similar status to  Auckland in the north, but the cities are too far distant (some eight  hundred nautical miles) to become rivals to the detriment of each other.    Beyond the railway, we look across the inland sweep of Mechanic's Bay to  the rising ground on its further side, crowned by the popular and  picturesque suburb of Parnell. On the river side the streets descend to  the shore; the houses, most of them pretty wooden villas, standing each  in its terraced garden grounds, embowered in rich foliage. On the land  side a gully divides Parnell from the Domain. This serves as a public  park and recreation ground for citizens of Auckland. It is a tract of  original forest or bush, through whose bosky glades winding walks have  been cut, leading up and down range and gully, furnished with seats and  arbours and artificial accessories. Conjoined to the Domain are the  gardens of the Acclimatization Society, which are beautiful and  interesting on account of their botanical and zoological contents.    Rising at some distance behind the Domain, we catch a glimpse of Mount  Hobson, upon whose sides nestles the suburb of the same name. To the  right of it lies the Great South Road, whereon is the village of  Newmarket, and beyond it again the scattered suburb of Epsom, and that  gem of lovely hamlets, Remuera.    Our eyes, slowly travelling round to take in all these points, are now  turned directly away from the harbour. Before us stretches a long road  named Symonds Street, leading past the Supreme Court--a brick and stone  building of considerable architectural pretension--past the wide  cemetery, and allowing beyond a sight of the hospital in the valley  below, on till the large suburb of Newton--hardly disconnected at all  from the city proper--is reached.    In this direction is situated Government House, a large mansion of wood,  standing in park-like grounds, where the English oak, the American  maple, the Australian blue-gum, the semi-tropical palm, and the New  Zealand kauri mingle their foliage together. Some distance further, and  to the left of the road, rises Mount Eden. On one side of it is the  gaol, a group of buildings surrounded by a wall and palisades, and  situated in a scoria quarry. Among the spurs and declivities of the  mount are many villas of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29084"],[0,"The Cook and Housekeeper's Complete and Universal Dictionary; Including a System (#6)"],[1,"is very infectious;  and parish churches, in which many corpses are interred, become tainted  with an atmosphere so corrupt, especially in the spring, when the ground  begins to grow warm, that it is one of the principal sources of putrid  fevers, which so often prevail at that season of the year. Such places  ought to be kept perfectly clean, and frequently ventilated, by opening  opposite doors and windows; and no human dwelling should be allowed in  the immediate vicinity of a burying ground.--The air of large towns and  cities is greatly contaminated, by being repeatedly respired; by the  vapours arising from dirty streets, the smoke of chimneys, and the  innumerable putrid substances occasioned by the crowd of inhabitants.  Persons of a delicate habit should avoid cities as they would the  plague; or if this be impracticable, they should go abroad as much as  possible, frequently admit fresh air into their rooms, and be careful to  keep them very clean. If they can sleep in the country, so much the  better, as breathing free air in the night will in some degree make up  for the want of it in the day time. Air which stagnates in mines, wells,  and cellars, is extremely noxious; it kills nearly as quick as  lightning, and ought therefore to be carefully avoided. Accidents  occasioned by foul air might often be prevented, by only letting down  into such places a lighted candle, and forbearing to enter when it is  perceived to go out. The foul air may be expelled by leaving the place  open a sufficient time, or pouring into it a quantity of boiling water.  Introducing fresh air into confined rooms and places, by means of  ventilators, is one of the most important of modern improvements.--Dyers,  gilders, plumbers, refiners of metals, and artisans employed over or  near a charcoal fire, are exposed to great danger from the vitiated  state of the air. To avert the injury to which their lungs are thus  exposed, it would be proper to place near them a flat open vessel filled  with lime water, and to renew it as often as a variegated film appears  on the surface. This powerfully attracts and absorbs the noxious  effluvia emitted by the burning charcoal.--But if fresh air be necessary  for those in health, much more so for the sick, who often lose their  lives for want of it. The notion that sick people require to be kept hot  is very common, but no less dangerous, for no medicine is so beneficial  to them as fresh air, in ordinary cases, especially if administered with  prudence. Doors and windows are not to be opened at random; but the air  should be admitted gradually, and chiefly by opening the windows of some  other apartment which communicates with the sick room. The air may  likewise be purified by wetting a cloth in water impregnated with quick  lime, then hanging it in the room till it becomes dry, and removing it  as often as it appears necessary. In chronic diseases, especially those  of the lungs, where there is no inflammation, a change of air is much to  be recommended. Independently of any other circumstance, it has often  proved highly beneficial; and such patients have breathed more freely,  even though removed to a damp and confined situation. In short, fresh  air contains the vitals of health, and must be sought for in every  situation, as the only medium of human existence.      ALABASTER. The proper way of cleaning elegant chimney pieces, or other  articles made of alabaster, is to reduce some pumice stone to a very  fine powder, and mix it up with verjuice. Let it stand two hours, then  dip into it a sponge, and rub the alabaster with it: wash it with fresh  water and a linen cloth, and dry it with clean linen rags.      ALAMODE BEEF. Choose a piece of thick flank of a fine heifer or ox. Cut  some fat bacon into long slices nearly an inch thick, but quite free  from yellow. Dip them into vinegar, and then into a seasoning ready  prepared, of salt, black pepper, allspice, and a clove, all in fine  powder, with parsley, chives, thyme, savoury, and knotted marjoram,  shred as small as possible, and well mixed. With a sharp knife make  holes deep enough to let in the larding; then rub the beef over with the  seasoning, and bind it up tight with a tape. Set it in a well tinned pot  over a fire, or rather a stove: three or four onions must be fried brown  and put to the beef, with two or three carrots, one turnip, a head or  two of celery, and a small quantity of water. Let it simmer gently ten  or twelve hours, or till extremely tender, turning the meat twice. Put  the gravy into a pan, remove the fat, keep the beef covered, then put  them together, and add a glass of port wine. Take off the tape, and  serve with vegetables; or strain them off, and cut them into dice for  garnish. Onions roasted, and then stewed with the gravy, are a great  improvement. A tea-cupful of vinegar should be stewed with the  beef.--Another way is to take about eleven pounds of the mouse-buttock,  or clod of beef, or a blade bone, or the sticking piece, and cut it into  pieces of three or four ounces each. Put two or three ounces of beef  drippings, and two large onions, into a large deep stewpan; as soon as  it is quite hot, flour the meat, put it into the stewpan, and keep  stirring it with a wooden spoon. When it has been on about ten minutes,  dredge it with flour, and keep doing so till you have stirred in as much  as will thicken it. Then cover it with about a gallon of boiling water,  adding it by degrees, and stirring it together. Skim it when it boils,  and then put in a dram of ground black pepper, and two drams of  allspice. Set the pan by the side of the fire, or at a distance over it,  and let it stew very slowly for about three hours. When the meat is  sufficiently tender, put it into a tureen, and send it to table with a  nice sallad.      ALE, allowing eight bushels of malt to the hogshead, should be brewed in  the beginning of March. Pour on at once the whole quantity of hot water,  not boiling, and let it infuse three hours close covered. Mash it in the  first half hour, and let it stand the remainder of the time. Run it on  the hops, half a pound to the bushel, previously infused in water, and  boil them with the wort two hours. Cool a pailful after it has boiled,  add to it two quarts of yeast, which will prepare it for putting to the  rest when ready, the same night or the next day. When tunned, and the  beer has done working, cover the bung-hole with paper. If the working  requires to be stopped, dry a pound and a half of hops before the fire,  put them into the bung-hole, and fasten it up. Ale should stand twelve  months in casks, and twelve in bottles, before it be drank; and if well  brewed, it will keep and be very fine for eight or ten years. It will  however be ready for use in three or four months; and if the vent-peg be  never removed, it will have strength and spirit to the very last. But if  bottled, great care must be taken to have the bottles perfectly sweet  and clean, and the corks of the best quality. If the ale requires to be  refined, put two ounces of isinglass shavings to soak in a quart of the  liquor, and beat it with a whisk every day till dissolved. Draw off a  third part of the cask, and mix the above with it: likewise a quarter of  an ounce of pearl ashes, one ounce of salt of tartar calcined, and one  ounce of burnt alum powdered. Stir it well, then return the liquor into  the cask, and stir it with a clean stick. Stop it up, and in a few days  it will be fine. See BEER, BREWING.      ALE POSSET. Beat up the yolks of ten eggs, and the whites of four; then  put them into a quart of cream, mixed with a pint of ale. Grate some  nutmeg into it, sweeten it with sugar, set it on the fire, and keep it  stirring. When it is thick, and before it boils, take it off, and pour  it into a china bason. This is called King William's Posset. A very good  one may however be made by warming a pint of milk, with a bit of white  bread in it, and then warming a pint of ale with a little sugar and  nutmeg. When the milk boils, pour it upon the ale; let it stand a few  minutes to clear, and it will make a fine cordial.      ALEGAR. Take some good sweet wort before it is hopped, put it into a  jar, and a little yeast when it becomes lukewarm, and cover it over. In  three or four days it will have done fermenting; set it in the sun, and  it will be fit for use in three or four months, or much sooner, if  fermented with sour yeast, and mixed with an equal quantity of sour ale.      ALLSPICE, used as an essence, is made of a dram of the oil of pimento,  apothecaries' measure, mixed by degrees with two ounces of strong  spirits of wine. The tincture, which has a finer flavour than the  essence, is made of three ounces of bruised allspice, steeped in a quart  of brandy. Shake it occasionally for a fortnight, and then pour off the  clear liquor. A few drops of either will be a grateful addition to a  pint of gravy, or mulled wine, or in any case where allspice is used.      ALMOND BISCUITS. Blanch a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds, and pound  them fine in a mortar, sprinkling them from time to time with a little  fine sugar. Then beat them a quarter of an hour with an ounce of flour,  the yolks of three eggs, and four ounces of fine sugar, adding  afterward the whites of four eggs whipped to a froth. Prepare some paper  moulds like boxes, about the length of two fingers square; butter them  within, and put in the biscuits, throwing over them equal quantities of  flour and powdered sugar. Bake them in a cool oven; and when of a good  colour, take them out of the papers. Bitter almond biscuits are made in  the same manner, except with this difference; that to every two ounces  of bitter almonds must be added an ounce of sweet almonds.      ALMOND CHEESECAKES. Blanch and pound four ounces of almonds, and a few  bitter ones, with a spoonful of water. Add four ounces of pounded sugar,  a spoonful"]]]
