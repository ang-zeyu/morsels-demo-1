Mostly people with  space-ships have disintegrator guns. They point them at you and you get  disintegratored.\"    \"They didn't point it at us till now,\" pointed out Red with his heart  not quite in it.    \"I don't care. I'm not hanging around here and getting disintegratored.  I'm getting my father.\"    \"Cowardy-cat. Yellow cowardy-cat.\"    \"I don't care. You can call all the names you want, but if you bother  them now you'll get disintegratored. You wait and see, and it'll be all  your fault.\"    He made for the narrow spiral stairs that led to the main floor of the  barn, stopped at its head, then backed away.    Red's mother was moving up, panting a little with the exertion and  smiling a tight smile for the benefit of Slim in his capacity as guest.    \"Red! You, Red! Are you up there? Now don't try to hide. I know this is  where you're keeping them. Cook saw where you ran with the meat.\"    Red quavered, \"Hello, ma!\"    \"Now show me those nasty animals? I'm going to see to it that you get  rid of them right away.\"    It was over! And despite the imminent corporal punishment, Red felt  something like a load fall from him. At least the decision was out of  his hands.    \"Right there, ma. I didn't do anything to them, ma. I didn't know. They  just looked like little animals and I thought you'd let me keep them,  ma. I wouldn't have taken the meat only they wouldn't eat grass or  leaves and we couldn't find good nuts or berries and cook never lets me  have anything or I would have asked her and I didn't know it was for  lunch and--\"    He was speaking on the sheer momentum of terror and did not realize that  his mother did not hear him but, with eyes frozen and popping at the  cage, was screaming in thin, piercing tones.      X    The Astronomer was saying, \"A quiet burial is all we can do. There is no  point in any publicity now,\" when they heard the screams.    She had not entirely recovered by the time she reached them, running and  running. It was minutes before her husband could extract sense from her.    She was saying, finally, \"I tell you they're in the barn. I don't know  what they are. No, no--\"    She barred the Industrialist's quick movement in that direction. She  said, \"Don't _you_ go. Send one of the hands with a shotgun. I tell you  I never saw anything like it. Little horrible beasts with--with--I can't  describe it. To think that Red was touching them and trying to feed  them. He was _holding_ them, and feeding them meat.\"    Red began, \"I only--\"    And Slim said, \"It was not--\"    The Industrialist said, quickly, \"Now you boys have done enough harm  today. March! Into the house! And not a word; not one word! I'm not  interested in anything you have to say. After this is all over, I'll  hear you out and as for you, Red, I'll see that you're properly  punished.\"    He turned to his wife. \"Now whatever the animals are, we'll have them  killed.\" He added quietly once the youngsters were out of hearing,  \"Come, come. The children aren't hurt and, after all, they haven't done  anything really terrible. They've just found a new pet.\"    The Astronomer spoke with difficulty. \"Pardon me, ma'am, but can you  describe these animals?\"    She shook her head. She was quite beyond words.    \"Can you just tell me if they--\"    \"I'm sorry,\" said the Industrialist, apologetically, \"but I think I had  better take care of her. Will you excuse me?\"    \"A moment. Please. One moment. She said she had never seen such animals  before. Surely it is not usual to find animals that are completely  unique on an estate such as this.\"    \"I'm sorry. Let's not discuss that now.\"    \"Except that unique animals might have landed during the night.\"    The Industrialist stepped away from his wife. \"What are you implying?\"    \"I think we had better go to the barn, sir!\"    The Industrialist stared a moment, turned and suddenly and quite  uncharacteristically began running. The Astronomer followed and the  woman's wail rose unheeded behind them.      XI    The Industrialist stared, looked at the Astronomer, turned to stare  again.    \"Those?\"    \"Those,\" said the Astronomer. \"I have no doubt we appear strange and  repulsive to them.\"    \"What do they say?\"    \"Why, that they are uncomfortable and tired and even a little sick, but  that they are not seriously damaged, and that the youngsters treated  them well.\"    \"Treated them well! Scooping them up, keeping them in a cage, giving  them grass and raw meat to eat? Tell me how to speak to them.\"    \"It may take a little time. Think _at_ them. Try to listen. It will come  to you, but perhaps not right away.\"    The Industrialist tried. He grimaced with the effort of it, thinking  over and over again, \"The youngsters were ignorant of your identity.\"    And the thought was suddenly in his mind: \"We were quite aware of it and  because we knew they meant well by us according to their own view of the  matter, we did not attempt to attack them.\"    \"Attack them?\" thought the Industrialist, and said it aloud in his  concentration.    \"Why, yes,\" came the answering thought. \"We are armed.\"    One of the revolting little creatures in the cage lifted a metal object  and there was a sudden hole in the top of the cage and another in the  roof of the barn, each hole rimmed with charred wood.    \"We hope,\" the creatures thought, \"it will not be too difficult to make  repairs.\"    The Industrialist found it impossible to organize himself to the point  of directed thought. He turned to the Astronomer. \"And with that weapon  in their possession they let themselves be handled and caged? I don't  understand it.\"    But the calm thought came, \"We would not harm the young of an  intelligent species.\"      XII    It was twilight. The Industrialist had entirely missed the evening meal  and remained unaware of the fact.    He said, \"Do you really think the ship will fly?\"    \"If they say so,\" said the Astronomer, \"I'm sure it will. They'll be  back, I hope, before too long.\"    \"And when they do,\" said the Industrialist, energetically, \"I will keep  my part of the agreement. What is more I will move sky and earth to have  the world accept them. I was entirely wrong, Doctor. Creatures that  would refuse to harm children, under such provocation as they received,  are admirable. But you know--I almost hate to say this--\"    \"Say what?\"    \"The kids. Yours and mine. I'm almost proud of them. Imagine seizing  these creatures, feeding them or trying to, and keeping them hidden. The  amazing gall of it. Red told me it was his idea to get a job in a circus  on the strength of them. Imagine!\"    The Astronomer said, \"Youth!\"      XIII    The Merchant said, \"Will we be taking off soon?\"    \"Half an hour,\" said the Explorer.    It was going to be a lonely trip back. All the remaining seventeen of  the crew were dead and their ashes were to be left on a strange planet.  Back they would go with a limping ship and the burden of the controls  entirely on himself.    The Merchant said, \"It was a good business stroke, not harming the young  ones. We will get very good terms; _very_ good terms.\"    The Explorer thought: Business!    The Merchant then said, \"They've lined up to see us off. All of them.  You don't think they're too close, do you? It would be bad to burn any  of them with the rocket blast at this stage of the game.\"    \"They're safe.\"    \"Horrible-looking things, aren't they?\"    \"Pleasant enough, inside. Their thoughts are perfectly friendly.\"    \"You wouldn't believe it of them. That immature one, the one that first  picked us up--\"    \"They call him Red,\" provided the Explorer.    \"That's a queer name for a monster. Makes me laugh. He actually feels  _bad_ that we're leaving. Only I can't make out exactly why. The nearest  I can come to it is something about a lost opportunity with some  organization or other that I can't quite interpret.\"    \"A circus,\" said the Explorer, briefly.    \"What? Why, the impertinent monstrosity.\"    \"Why not? What would you have done if you had found _him_ wandering on  _your_ native world; found him sleeping on a field on Earth, red  tentacles, six legs, pseudopods and all?\"      XIV    Red watched the ship leave. His red tentacles, which gave him his  nickname, quivered their regret at lost opportunity to the very last,  and the eyes at their tips filled with drifting yellowish crystals that  were the equivalent of Earthly tears.

I want you to have him. He can be your baby.\"    \"Thank you, Phyl,\" Maggie said softly. \"That's very ... blue of you.\"    \"Although I think that's a jim-dandy idea,\" the biologist said, \"and I  sure wouldn't want to do anything to discourage it, being real  interested in the results of an experiment like that my own self, I  don't think you ought to feel so mean about it, Miz Phyllis. If all she  wanted--begging your pardon, Miss Magnolia, ma'am--was a baby, why  didn't she take an interest in the holly until she found out it was a  male? Why wouldn't a little old girl holly have done as well?\"    \"Why--why, you scheming vegetable!\" Phyllis exploded at Magnolia,  clutching the holly plant to her protective bosom. \"He's much too young  for you, and I'm going to plant him far away, where he can't possibly  fall into your clutches.\"    \"Now, Miss Phyllis, we-all mustn't look at things out of their proper  perspective.\"    \"Then why did you take your hat off when you were introduced to Miss  Magnolia, Cutler?\" Dr. Lakin asked interestedly.    \"Sir, where I come from, we respect femininity, whether it be animal,  vegetable or mineral. Nonetheless, we-all got to remember, though Miss  Magnolia is unquestionably a lady, she is not a woman.\"    Phyllis began to laugh hysterically. \"You're right!\" she gasped. \"I had  almost forgotten _she_ was only a tree. And that _it_ is only a little  Christmas holly plant that's probably going to die, anyway--they almost  always do.\"    \"That's cruel, Phyllis,\" James said, \"and you know it is.\"    \"Do you really think I'm cruel? Are you going to tell the Society for  the Prevention of Cruelty to Vegetables on me? But why am I cruel? I'm  giving her the holly. That's what she wants, isn't it? Do you hear that,  Miss Magnolia, ma'am? _He_'s all yours. We'll plant _him_ next to  you--right away. And I hope _he_ doesn't die. I hope _he_ grows up to  make you a good husband.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"She's really quite remarkable,\" Dr. Lakin said to James later that same  evening, after the planting ceremonies were over and the rest of the  party had gone into the cottage for fresh coffee and more sandwiches and  cookies and penuche. \"Quite remarkable. You're a lucky man, Haut.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" James replied abstractedly. \"I'm sure Phyllis will be  pleased to--\"    \"_Phyllis!_ Oh, Mrs. Haut is a very remarkable woman, of course. A  handsome, strong girl; she'll make a splendid mother, I'm sure. But I  was referring to Miss Magnolia. She's a credit to you, my boy. If for no  other reason, your name will go down in the history of our colony as  that of the guide and mentor of Miss Magnolia. That's quite a tree you  have there.\"    James looked at the dark form of the tree--for the lights had been  turned out--silhouetted against the three pale moons and the violet  night. \"Yes, she is,\" he said.    \"You're fortunate to be her neighbor ... and her friend.\"    \"Yes, I am.\"    \"Well, I expect I'd better join the rest. Are you coming on in, Jim?\"    \"In a little while, sir. I thought I'd--I wanted to have a word with  Magnolia. I won't be long.\"    \"Of course, of course. I'm delighted to see that there is such an  excellent relationship between you.... Good night, Miss Magnolia!\" he  called.    \"Good night, Dr. Lakin,\" the tree replied, politely enough, but it was  obvious that she was preoccupied with her new charge, who stood as close  to her as it was possible to plant him and yet allow room for him to  grow.           *       *       *       *       *    The door closed. James walked across the lawn until he was quite near  Magnolia. \"Maggie,\" he whispered, reaching out to touch her  trunk--smooth it was, and hard, but he could feel the vibrant life  pulsing inside it. Certainly she was not a plant, not _just_ a plant,  even though she was a tree. She was a native of Elysium, neither animal  nor vegetable, unique unto the planet, unique unto herself. \"Maggie.\"    \"Yes, Jim. Don't you think his silhouette is so graceful there in the  moonlight? He isn't really puny--just frail.\"    \"Maggie, you're not serious about this holly?\"    \"What do you mean?\" And still he didn't have her full attention. Would  he ever have it again?    \"Serious about raising him to be your--your--\"    \"Why not, Jim?\"    \"It's impossible.\"    \"Is it? It certainly is far more possible with him, isn't it? That much  I understood from your zoology books.\"    \"I suppose so.\"    \"Besides, I have nothing to lose, have I?\"    \"But even if it were possible, wouldn't it be humiliating for you? The  creature's mindless!\"    Magnolia's leaves rustled in the darkness. She was laughing--a little  bitterly. \"Your Phyllis isn't your intellectual equal, Jim, and yet you  say you love her and I suppose you do. Am I not entitled to my follies  also?\"    But she couldn't compare Phyllis to a holly plant! It was unreasonable.    \"He may die, of course,\" Magnolia said. \"I've got to be prepared for  that. The soil is different, the air is different, the sun is different.  But the chances are, if he survives, he'll turn blue. And if he turns  blue, who knows what other changes might be brought about? Maybe the  plants on your Earth aren't inherently mindless, Jim. Maybe they just  didn't have a chance. 'Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle  are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime...?' That land isn't  Earth, Jim, so it might just possibly be Elysium.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Again he didn't say anything. What he wanted to say, he had no right to  say, so he kept silent.    \"It'll be a chance for me, too, Jim. At least we're both plants, he and  I. That gives us a headstart.\"    \"Yes, I suppose it does.\"    \"Intellect doesn't count for much in the propagation of the species.  Life goes on without regard for reason, and that's mainly what we're  here for, to make sure that life goes on--if we're here for anything at  all. Thanks to your kind, Jim, life will continue on this planet; it  will certainly be your kind of life--and I hope it can be ours as well.\"    \"Yes,\" he said. \"I hope so, too.\"    And he did, but he wished it didn't have to continue in quite that way.  Perhaps it was a trick of the three moons, but the holly plant's leaves  seemed to have changed color.. They were no longer green, but almost  blue--powder blue.    \"You'd best be getting on to your party, Jim,\" Magnolia said. \"You  wouldn't want to be remiss in your duties as host. And please close the  door gently when you go inside. The little holly plant's asleep.\"    As he closed the door carefully behind him, he heard a burst of laughter  coming from the kitchen, where the guests apparently had  assembled--raucous animal laughter--and, rising shrill and noisy above  it, Phyllis's company laugh.      --EVELYN E."]]]
