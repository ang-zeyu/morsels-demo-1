If they just went straight they might go far;            They are strong and brave and true;          But they're always tired of the things that are,            And they want the strange and new.          They say: \"Could I find my proper groove,            What a deep mark I would make!\"          So they chop and change, and each fresh move            Is only a fresh mistake.        And each forgets, as he strips and runs,        With a brilliant, fitful pace,      It's the steady, quiet, plodding ones        Who win in the lifelong race.      And each forgets that his youth has fled,        Forgets that his prime is past,      Till he stands one day with a hope that's dead        In the glare of the truth at last.            He has failed, he has failed; he has missed his chance;            He has just done things by half.          Life's been a jolly good joke on him,            And now is the time to laugh.          Ha, ha! He is one of the Legion Lost;            He was never meant to win;          He's a rolling stone, and it's bred in the bone;            He's a man who won't fit in.          MUSIC IN THE BUSH          O'er the dark pines she sees the silver moon,        And in the west, all tremulous, a star;      And soothing sweet she hears the mellow tune        Of cow-bells jangled in the fields afar.        Quite listless, for her daily stent is done,        She stands, sad exile, at her rose-wreathed door,      And sends her love eternal with the sun        That goes to gild the land she'll see no more.        The grave, gaunt pines imprison her sad gaze,        All still the sky and darkling drearily;      She feels the chilly breath of dear, dead days        Come sifting through the alders eerily.        Oh, how the roses riot in their bloom!        The curtains stir as with an ancient pain;      Her old piano gleams from out the gloom,        And waits and waits her tender touch in vain.        But now her hands like moonlight brush the keys        With velvet grace, melodious delight;      And now a sad refrain from overseas        Goes sobbing on the bosom of the night.        And now she sings. (O singer in the gloom,        Voicing a sorrow we can ne'er express,      Here in the Farness where we few have room        Unshamed to show our love and tenderness,        Our hearts will echo, till they beat no more,        That song of sadness and of motherland;      And stretched in deathless love to England's shore,        Some day she'll hearken and she'll understand.)        A prima-donna in the shining past,        But now a mother growing old and grey,      She thinks of how she held a people fast        In thrall, and gleaned the triumphs of a day.        She sees a sea of faces like a dream;        She sees herself a queen of song once more;      She sees lips part in rapture, eyes agleam;        She sings as never once she sang before.        She sings a wild, sweet song that throbs with pain,        The added pain of life that transcends art,      A song of home, a deep, celestial strain,        The glorious swan-song of a dying heart.        A lame tramp comes along the railway track,        A grizzled dog whose day is nearly done:      He passes, pauses, then comes slowly back        And listens there--an audience of one.        She sings--her golden voice is passion-fraught        As when she charmed a thousand eager ears;      He listens trembling, and she knows it not,        And down his hollow cheeks roll bitter tears.        She ceases and is still, as if to pray;        There is no sound, the stars are all alight--      Only a wretch who stumbles on his way,        Only a vagrant sobbing in the night.          THE RHYME OF THE REMITTANCE MAN          There's a four-pronged buck a-swinging in the shadow of my cabin,        And it roamed the velvet valley till to-day;      But I tracked it by the river, and I trailed it in the cover,        And I killed it on the mountain miles away.      Now I've had my lazy supper, and the level sun is gleaming        On the water where the silver salmon play;      And I light my little corn-cob, and I linger softly dreaming,        In the twilight, of a land that's far away.        Far away, so faint and far, is flaming London, fevered Paris,        That I fancy I have gained another star;      Far away the din and hurry, far away the sin and worry,        Far away--God knows they cannot be too far.      Gilded galley-slaves of Mammon--how my purse-proud brothers taunt me!        I might have been as well-to-do as they      Had I clutched like them my chances, learned their wisdom, crushed            my fancies,        Starved my soul and gone to business every day.        Well, the cherry bends with blossom, and the vivid grass is springing,        And the star-like lily nestles in the green;      And the frogs their joys are singing, and my heart in tune is ringing,        And it doesn't matter what I might have been,      While above the scented pine-gloom, piling heights of golden glory,        The sun-god paints his canvas in the west;      I can couch me deep in clover, I can listen to the story        Of the lazy, lapping water--it is best.      While the trout leaps in the river, and the blue grouse thrills the            cover,        And the frozen snow betrays the panther's track,      And the robin greets the dayspring with the rapture of a lover,        I am happy, and I'll nevermore go back.      For I know I'd just be longing for the little old log cabin,        With the morning-glory clinging to the door,      Till I loathed the city places, cursed the care on all the faces,        Turned my back on lazar London evermore.        So send me far from Lombard Street, and write me down a failure;        Put a little in my purse and leave me free.      Say: \"He turned from Fortune's offering to follow up a pale lure,        He is one of us no longer--let him be.\"      I am one of you no longer: by the trails my feet have broken,        The dizzy peaks I've scaled, the camp-fire's glow,      By the lonely seas I've sailed in--yea, the final word is spoken,        I am signed and sealed to nature. Be it so.          THE LOW-DOWN WHITE          This is the pay-day up at the mines, when the bearded brutes come down;      There's money to burn in the streets to-night, so I've sent my            klooch to town,      With a haggard face and a ribband of red entwined in her hair of brown.        And I know at the dawn she'll come reeling home with the bottles,            one, two, three;      One for herself to drown her shame, and two big bottles for me,      To make me forget the thing I am and the man I used to be.        To make me forget the brand of the dog, as I crouch in this hideous            place;      To make me forget once I kindled the light of love in a lady's face,      Where even the squalid Siwash now holds me a black disgrace.        Oh, I have guarded my secret well! And who would dream as I speak      In a tribal tongue like a rogue unhung, 'mid the ranch-house filth            and reek,      I could roll to bed with a Latin phrase, and rise with a verse of            Greek?        Yet I was a senior prizeman once, and the pride of a college eight;      Called to the bar--my friends were true! but they could not keep me            straight;      Then came the divorce, and I went abroad and \"died\" on the River Plate.        But I'm not dead yet; though with half a lung there isn't time to            spare,      And I hope that the year will see me out, and, thank God, no one            will care--      Save maybe the little slim Siwash girl with the rose of shame in her            hair.        She will come with the dawn, and the dawn is near; I can see its            evil glow,      Like a corpse-light seen through a frosty pane in a night of want            and woe;      And yonder she comes, by the bleak bull-pines, swift staggering            through the snow.          THE LITTLE OLD LOG CABIN          When a man gits on his uppers in a hard-pan sort of town,        An' he ain't got nothin' comin', an' he can't afford ter eat,      An' he's in a fix fer lodgin', an' he wanders up an' down,        An' you'd fancy he'd been boozin', he's so locoed 'bout the feet;      When he's feelin' sneakin' sorry, an' his belt is hangin' slack,        An' his face is peaked an' grey-like, an' his heart gits down an'            whines,      Then he's apt ter git a-thinkin' an' a-wishin' he was back        In the little ol' log cabin in the shadder of the pines.        When he's on the blazin' desert, an' his canteen's sprung a leak,        An' he's all alone an' crazy, an' he's crawlin' like a snail,      An' his tongue's so black an' swollen that it hurts him fer to speak,        An' he gouges down fer water, an' the raven's on his trail;      When he's done with care and cursin', an' he feels more like to cry,        An' he sees ol' Death a-grinnin', an' he thinks upon his crimes,      Then he's like ter hev' a vision, as he settles down ter die,        Of the little ol' log cabin an' the roses an' the vines.        Oh, the little ol' log cabin, it's a solemn shinin' mark        When a feller gits ter sinnin', an' a-goin' ter the wall,      An' folks don't understand him, an' he's gropin' in the dark,        An' he's sick of bein' cursed at, an' he's longin' fer his call:      When the sun of life's a-sinkin' you can see it 'way above,        On the hill from out the shadder in a glory 'gin the sky,      An' your mother's voice is callin', an' her arms are stretched in love,        An' somehow you're glad you're goin', an' you ain't a-scared to die;      When you'll be like a kid again, an' nestle to her breast,        An' never leave its shelter, an' forget, an' love, an' rest.          THE YOUNGER SON          If you leave the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25550"],[0,"The Defiant Agents (#6)"],[1,"at a slant--aimed now at  Travis. He had been right in his guess at their deadliness, but he had  only a fleeting chance to recognize that fact as the thing bore down,  its whole attitude expressing the firm intention of goring him.    He hurled his stone and then flung his body to one side, stumbling and  rolling into the brush where he fought madly to regain his feet,  expecting at any moment to feel trampling hoofs and thrusting horns.  There was a crash to his right, and the bushes and grass were wildly  shaken.    On his hands and knees the Apache retreated, his head turned to watch  behind him. He saw the flirt of a triangular flap-tail in the mouth of  the cleft. The calf had escaped. And now the threshing in the bushes  stilled.    Was the thing stalking him? He got to his feet, for the first time  hearing clearly the continued yapping, as if a battle was in progress.  Then the second of the adult beasts came into view, backing and turning,  trying to keep lowered head with menacing double horn always pointed to  the coyotes dancing a teasing, worrying circle about it.    One of the coyotes flung up its head, looked upslope, and barked. Then,  as one, both rushed the fighting beast, but for the first time from the  same side, leaving it a clear path to retreat. It made a rush before  which they fled easily, and then it whirled with a speed and grace,  which did not fit its ungainly, ill-proportioned body, and jumped  toward the cleft, the coyotes making no effort to hinder its escape.    Travis came out of cover, approaching the brush which had concealed the  crash of the other animal. The actions of the coyotes had convinced him  that there was no danger now; they would never have allowed the escape  of their prey had the first beast not been in difficulties.    His shot with the stone, the Apache decided as he stood moments later  surveying the twitching crumpled body, must have hit the thing in the  head, stunning it. Then the momentum of its charge had carried it full  force against the rock to kill it. Blind luck--or the power of the  _ga-n_? He pulled back as the coyotes came padding up shoulder to  shoulder to inspect the kill. It was truly more theirs than his.    Their prey yielded not only food but a weapon for Travis. Instead of the  belt knife he had remembered having, he was now equipped with two. The  double horn had been easy to free from the shattered skull, and some  careful work with stones had broken off one prong at just the angle he  wanted. So now he had a short and a longer tool, defense. At least they  were better than the stone with which he had entered the hunt.    Nalik'ideyu pushed past him to lap daintily at the water. Then she sat  up on her haunches, watching Travis as he smoothed the horn with a  stone.    \"A knife,\" he said to her, \"this will be a knife. And--\" he glanced up,  measuring the value of the wood represented by trees and bushes--\"then a  bow. With a bow we shall hunt better.\"    The coyote yawned, her yellow eyes half closed, her whole pose one of  satisfaction and contentment.    \"A knife,\" Travis repeated, \"and a bow.\" He needed weapons; he had to  have them!    Why? His hand stopped scraping. Why? The toad-faced double horn had been  quick to attack, but Travis could have avoided it, and it had not hunted  him first. Why was he ridden by this fear that he must not be unarmed?    He dipped his hand into the pool of the spring and lifted the water to  cool his sweating face. The coyote moved, turned around in the grass,  crushing down the growth into a nest in which she curled up, head on  paws. But Travis sat back on his heels, his now idle hands hanging down  between his knees, and forced himself to the task of sorting out jumbled  memories.    This landscape was wrong--totally unlike what it should be--but it was  real. He had helped kill this alien creature. He had eaten its meat,  raw. Its horn lay within touch now. All that was real and unchangeable.  Which meant that the rest of it, that other desert world in which he had  wandered with his kind, ridden horses, raided invading men of another  race, that was not real--or else far, far removed from where he now sat.    Yet there had been no dividing line between those two worlds. One moment  he had been in the desert place, returning from a successful foray  against the Mexicans. Mexicans! Travis caught at that identification,  tried to use it as a thread to draw closer to the beginning of his  mystery.    Mexicans.... And he was an Apache, one of the Eagle people, one who rode  with Cochise. No!    Sweat again beaded his face where the water had cooled it. He was not of  that past. He was Travis Fox, of the very late twentieth century, not a  nomad of the middle nineteenth! He was of Team A of the project!    The Arizona desert and then this! From one to the other in an instant.  He looked about him in rising fear. Wait! He had been in the dark when  he got out of the desert, lying in a box. Getting out, he had crawled  down a passage to reach moonlight, strange moonlight.    A box in which he had lain, a passage with smooth metallic walls, and an  alien world at the end of it.    The coyote's ears twitched, her head came up, she was staring at the  man's drawn face, at his eyes with their core of fear. She whined.    Travis caught up the two pieces of horn, thrust them into his sash belt,  and got to his feet. Nalik'ideyu sat up, her head cocked a little to one  side. As the man turned to seek his own back trail she padded along in  his wake and whined for Naginlta. But Travis was more intent now on what  he must prove to himself than he was on the actions of the two animals.    It was a wandering trail, and now he did not question his skill in being  able to follow it so unerringly. The sun was hot. Winged things buzzed  from the bushes, small scuttling things fled from him through the tall  grass. Once Naginlta growled a warning which led them all to a detour,  and Travis might not have picked up the proper trace again had not the  coyote scout led him to it.    \"Who are you?\" he asked once, and then guessed it would have better been  said, \"What are you?\" These were not animals, or rather they were more  than the animals he had always known. And one part of him, the part  which remembered the desert rancherias where Cochise had ruled, said  they were spirits. Yet that other part of him.... Travis shook his  head, accepting them now for what they were--welcome company in an alien  place.    The day wore on close to sunset, and still Travis followed that  wandering trail. The need which drove him kept him going through the  rough country of hills and ravines. Now the mist lifted above towering  walls of mountains very near him, yet not the mountains of his memory.  These were dull brown, with a forbidding look, like sun-dried skulls  baring teeth in warning against all comers.    With great difficulty, Travis topped a rise. Ahead against the skyline  stood both coyotes. And, as the man joined them, first one and then the  other flung back its head and sounded the sobbing, shattering cry which  had been a part of that other life.    The Apache looked down. His puzzle was answered in part. The wreckage  crumpled on the mountain side was identifiable--a spaceship! Cold fear  gripped him and his own head went back; from between his tight lips came  a cry as desolate and despairing as the one the animals had voiced.          4      Fire, mankind's oldest ally, weapon, tool, leaped high before the naked  stone of the mountain side. Men sat cross-legged about it, fifteen of  them. And behind, guarded by the flames and that somber circle, were the  women. There was a uniformity in this gathering. The members were  plainly all of the same racial stock, of medium height, stocky yet fined  down to the peak of stamina and endurance, their skin brown, their  shoulder-length hair black. And they were all young--none over thirty,  some still in their late teens. Alike, too, was a certain drawn look in  their faces, a tenseness of the eyes and mouth as they listened to  Travis.    \"So we must be on Topaz. Do any of you remember boarding the ship?\"    \"No. Only that we awoke within it.\" Across the fire one chin lifted; the  eyes which caught Travis' held a deep, smoldering anger. \"This is more  trickery of the Pinda-lick-o-yi, the White Eyes. Between us there has  never been fair dealing. They have broken their promise as a man breaks  a rotten stick, for their words are as rotten. And it was you, Fox, who  brought us to listen to them.\"    A stir about the circle, a murmur from the women.    \"And do I not also sit here with you in this strange wilderness?\" he  countered.    \"I do not understand,\" another of the men held out his hand, palm up, in  a gesture of asking--\"what has happened to us. We were in the old Apache  world.... I, Jil-Lee, was riding with Cuchillo Negro as we went down to  the taking of Ramos. And then I was here, in a broken ship and beside me  a dead man who was once my brother. How did I come out of the past of  our people into another world across the stars?\"    \"Pinda-lick-o-yi tricks!\" The first speaker spat into the fire.    \"It was the Redax, I think,\" Travis replied. \"I heard Dr. Ashe discuss  this. A new machine which could make a man remember not his own past,  but the past of his ancestors. While we were on that ship we must have  been under its influence, so we lived as our people lived a hundred  years or more ago--\"    \"And the purpose of such a thing?\" Jil-Lee asked.    \"To make us more like our ancestors perhaps. It is part of what they  told us at the project. To venture into these new worlds requires a  different type of man than lives on Terra today. Traits we have  forgotten are needed to face the dangers of wild places.\"    \"You, Fox, have been beyond the stars before, and you found there were  such dangers to face?\"    \"It is true. You have heard of the three worlds I"]]]
