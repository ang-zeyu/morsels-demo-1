Nevertheless, as supernumerary digits in the  higher animals, from their power of regrowth and from the number thus  acquired exceeding five, partake of the nature of the digits in the lower  vertebrate animals;--as they occur by no means rarely, and are transmitted  with remarkable strength, though perhaps not more strongly than some other  anomalies;--and as with animals which have fewer than five digits, when an  additional one appears it is generally due to the development of a visible  rudiment;--we are led in all cases to suspect, that, although no actual  rudiment can be detected, yet that a latent tendency to the formation of an  additional digit exists in all mammals, including man. On this view, as we  shall more plainly see in the {17} next chapter when discussing latent  tendencies, we should have to look at the whole case as one of reversion to  an enormously remote, lowly-organised, and multidigitate progenitor.           *       *       *       *       *    I may here allude to a class of facts closely allied to, but somewhat  different from, ordinary cases of inheritance. Sir H. Holland[40] states  that brothers and sisters of the same family are frequently affected, often  at about the same age, by the same peculiar disease, not known to have  previously occurred in the family. He specifies the occurrence of diabetes  in three brothers under ten years old; he also remarks that children of the  same family often exhibit in common infantile diseases the same peculiar  symptoms. My father mentioned to me the case of four brothers who died  between the ages of sixty and seventy, in the same highly peculiar comatose  state. An instance has been already given of supernumerary digits appearing  in four children out of six in a previously unaffected family. Dr. Devay  states[41] that two brothers married two sisters, their first-cousins, none  of the four nor any relation being an albino; but the seven children  produced from this double marriage were all perfect albinoes. Some of these  cases, as Mr. Sedgwick[42] has shown, are probably the result of reversion  to a remote ancestor, of whom no record had been preserved; and all these  cases are so far directly connected with inheritance that no doubt the  children inherited a similar constitution from their parents, and, from  being exposed to nearly similar conditions of life, it is not surprising  that they should be affected in the same manner and at the same period of  life.           *       *       *       *       *    Most of the facts hitherto given have served to illustrate the force of  inheritance, but we must now consider cases, grouped as well as the subject  allows into classes, showing how feeble, capricious, or deficient the power  of inheritance sometimes is. When a new peculiarity first appears, we can  never predict whether it will be inherited. If both parents from their  birth present {18} the same peculiarity, the probability is strong that it  will be transmitted to at least some of their offspring. We have seen that  variegation is transmitted much more feebly by seed from a branch which had  become variegated through bud-variation, than from plants which were  variegated as seedlings. With most plants the power of transmission  notoriously depends on some innate capacity in the individual: thus  Vilmorin[43] raised from a peculiarly coloured balsam some seedlings, which  all resembled their parent; but of these seedlings some failed to transmit  the new character, whilst others transmitted it to all their descendants  during several successive generations. So again with a variety of the rose,  two plants alone out of six were found by Vilmorin to be capable of  transmitting the desired character.        The weeping or pendulous growth of trees is strongly inherited in some      cases, and, without any assignable reason, feebly in other cases. I      have selected this character as an instance of capricious inheritance,      because it is certainly not proper to the parent-species, and because,      both sexes being borne on the same tree, both tend to transmit the same      character. Even supposing that there may have been in some instances      crossing with adjoining trees of the same species, it is not probable      that all the seedlings would have been thus affected. At Moccas Court      there is a famous weeping oak; many of its branches \"are 30 feet long,      and no thicker in any part of this length than a common rope:\" this      tree transmits its weeping character, in a greater or less degree, to      all its seedlings; some of the young oaks being so flexible that they      have to be supported by props; others not showing the weeping tendency      till about twenty years old.[44] Mr. Rivers fertilized, as he informs      me, the flowers of a new Belgian weeping thorn (_Crataegus oxyacantha_)      with pollen from a crimson not-weeping variety, and three young trees,      \"now six or seven years old, show a decided tendency to be pendulous,      but as yet are not so much so as the mother-plant.\" According to Mr.      MacNab,[45] seedlings from a magnificent weeping birch (_Betula alba_),      in the Botanic Garden at Edinburgh, grew for the first ten or fifteen      years upright, but then all became weepers like their parent. A peach      with pendulous branches, like those of the weeping willow, has been      found capable of propagation by seed.[46] Lastly, a weeping and almost      prostrate yew (_Taxus baccata_) was found in a hedge in Shropshire; it      was a male, but one branch bore female flowers, and produced berries;      these, {19} being sown, produced seventeen trees, all of which had      exactly the same peculiar habit with the parent-tree.[47]        These facts, it might have been thought, would have been sufficient to      render it probable that a pendulous habit would in all cases be      strictly inherited. But let us look to the other side. Mr. MacNab[48]      sowed seeds of the weeping beech (_Fagus sylvanica_), but succeeded in      raising only common beeches. Mr. Rivers, at my request, raised a number      of seedlings from three distinct varieties of weeping elm; and at least      one of the parent-trees was so situated that it could not have been      crossed by any other elm; but none of the young trees, now about a foot      or two in height, show the least signs of weeping. Mr. Rivers formerly      sowed above twenty thousand seeds of the weeping ash (_Fraxinus      excelsior_), and not a single seedling was in the least degree      pendulous: in Germany, M. Borchmeyer raised a thousand seedlings, with      the same result. Nevertheless, Mr. Anderson, of the Chelsea Botanic      Garden, by sowing seed from a weeping ash, which was found before the      year 1780, in Cambridgeshire, raised several pendulous trees.[49]      Professor Henslow also informs me that some seedlings from a female      weeping ash in the Botanic Garden at Cambridge were at first a little      pendulous, but afterwards became quite upright: it is probable that      this latter tree, which transmits to a certain extent its pendulous      habit, was derived by a bud from the same original Cambridgeshire      stock; whilst other weeping ashes may have had a distinct origin. But      the crowning case, communicated to me by Mr. Rivers, which shows how      capricious is the inheritance of a pendulous habit, is that a variety      of another species of ash (_F. lentiscifolia_) which was formerly      pendulous, \"now about twenty years old has long lost this habit, every      shoot being remarkably erect; but seedlings formerly raised from it      were perfectly prostrate, the stems not rising more than two inches      above the ground.\" Thus the weeping variety of the common ash, which      has been extensively propagated by buds during a long period, did not,      with Mr. Rivers, transmit its character to one seedling out of above      twenty thousand; whereas the weeping variety of a second species of      ash, which could not, whilst grown in the same garden, retain its own      weeping character, transmitted to its seedlings the pendulous habit in      excess!        Many analogous facts could be given, showing how apparently capricious      is the principle of inheritance. All the seedlings from a variety of      the Barberry (_B. vulgaris_) with red leaves inherited the same      character; only about one-third of the seedlings of the copper Beech      (_Fagus sylvatica_) had purple leaves. Not one out of a hundred      seedlings of a variety of the _Cerasus padus_, with yellow fruit, bore      yellow fruit: one-twelfth of the seedlings of the variety of _Cornus      mascula_, with yellow fruit, came true:[50] and lastly, all the trees      raised by my father from a yellow-berried holly (_Ilex aquifolium_),      {20} found wild, produced yellow berries. Vilmorin[51] observed in a      bed of _Saponaria calabrica_ an extremely dwarf variety, and raised      from it a large number of seedlings; some of these partially resembled      their parent, and he selected their seed; but the grandchildren were      not in the least dwarfed: on the other hand, he observed a stunted and      bushy variety of _Tagetes signata_ growing in the midst of the common      varieties by which it was probably crossed; for most of the seedlings      raised from this plant were intermediate in character, only two      perfectly resembling their parent; but seed saved from these two plants      reproduced the new variety so truly, that hardly any selection has      since been necessary."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2892"],[0,"Irish Fairy Tales (#6)"],[1,"a band of travelling poets were passing, and the  women handed Fionn over to them. This time they could not prevent him  overhearing.    \"The sons of Morna!\" they said.    And Fionn's heart might have swelled with rage, but that it was already  swollen with adventure. And also the expected was happening. Behind  every hour of their day and every moment of their lives lay the sons of  Morna. Fionn had run after them as deer: he jumped after them as hares:  he dived after them as fish. They lived in the house with him: they  sat at the table and ate his meat. One dreamed of them, and they were  expected in the morning as the sun is. They knew only too well that the  son of Uail was living, and they knew that their own sons would know  no ease while that son lived; for they believed in those days that like  breeds like, and that the son of Uail would be Uail with additions.    His guardians knew that their hiding-place must at last be discovered,  and that, when it was found, the sons of Morna would come. They had  no doubt of that, and every action of their lives was based on that  certainty. For no secret can remain secret. Some broken soldier tramping  home to his people will find it out; a herd seeking his strayed cattle  or a band of travelling musicians will get the wind of it. How many  people will move through even the remotest wood in a year! The crows  will tell a secret if no one else does; and under a bush, behind a clump  of bracken, what eyes may there not be! But if your secret is legged  like a young goat! If it is tongued like a wolf! One can hide a baby,  but you cannot hide a boy. He will rove unless you tie him to a post,  and he will whistle then.    The sons of Morna came, but there were only two grim women living in a  lonely hut to greet them. We may be sure they were well greeted. One can  imagine Goll's merry stare taking in all that could be seen; Cona'n's  grim eye raking the women's faces while his tongue raked them again; the  Rough mac Morna shouldering here and there in the house and about it,  with maybe a hatchet in his hand, and Art Og coursing further afield and  vowing that if the cub was there he would find him.        CHAPTER VI    But Fionn was gone. He was away, bound with his band of poets for the  Galtees.    It is likely they were junior poets come to the end of a year's  training, and returning to their own province to see again the people at  home, and to be wondered at and exclaimed at as they exhibited bits of  the knowledge which they had brought from the great schools. They would  know tags of rhyme and tricks about learning which Fionn would hear of;  and now and again, as they rested in a glade or by the brink of a river,  they might try their lessons over. They might even refer to the ogham  wands on which the first words of their tasks and the opening lines of  poems were cut; and it is likely that, being new to these things, they  would talk of them to a youngster, and, thinking that his wits could be  no better than their own, they might have explained to him how ogham was  written. But it is far more likely that his women guardians had already  started him at those lessons.    Still this band of young bards would have been of infinite interest to  Fionn, not on account of what they had learned, but because of what they  knew. All the things that he should have known as by nature: the look,  the movement, the feeling of crowds; the shouldering and intercourse of  man with man; the clustering of houses and how people bore themselves  in and about them; the movement of armed men, and the homecoming look  of wounds; tales of births, and marriages and deaths; the chase with its  multitudes of men and dogs; all the noise, the dust, the excitement of  mere living. These, to Fionn, new come from leaves and shadows and the  dipple and dapple of a wood, would have seemed wonderful; and the tales  they would have told of their masters, their looks, fads, severities,  sillinesses, would have been wonderful also.    That band should have chattered like a rookery.    They must have been young, for one time a Leinsterman came on them, a  great robber named Fiacuil mac Cona, and he killed the poets. He chopped  them up and chopped them down. He did not leave one poeteen of them  all. He put them out of the world and out of life, so that they stopped  being, and no one could tell where they went or what had really happened  to them; and it is a wonder indeed that one can do that to anything let  alone a band. If they were not youngsters, the bold Fiacuil could not  have managed them all. Or, perhaps, he too had a band, although the  record does not say so; but kill them he did, and they died that way.    Fionn saw that deed, and his blood may have been cold enough as he  watched the great robber coursing the poets as a wild dog rages in a  flock. And when his turn came, when they were all dead, and the grim,  red-handed man trod at him, Fionn may have shivered, but he would have  shown his teeth and laid roundly on the monster with his hands. Perhaps  he did that, and perhaps for that he was spared.    \"Who are you?\" roared the staring black-mouth with the red tongue  squirming in it like a frisky fish.    \"The son of Uail, son of Baiscne,\" quoth hardy Fionn. And at that the  robber ceased to be a robber, the murderer disappeared, the black-rimmed  chasm packed with red fish and precipices changed to something else, and  the round eyes that had been popping out of their sockets and trying  to bite, changed also. There remained a laughing and crying and loving  servant who wanted to tie himself into knots if that would please the  son of his great captain. Fionn went home on the robber's shoulder, and  the robber gave great snorts and made great jumps and behaved like a  first-rate horse. For this same Fiacuil was the husband of Bovmall,  Fionn's aunt. He had taken to the wilds when clann-Baiscne was broken,  and he was at war with a world that had dared to kill his Chief.        CHAPTER VII    A new life for Fionn in the robber's den that was hidden in a vast cold  marsh.    A tricky place that would be, with sudden exits and even suddener  entrances, and with damp, winding, spidery places to hoard treasure in,  or to hide oneself in.    If the robber was a solitary he would, for lack of someone else,  have talked greatly to Fionn. He would have shown his weapons and  demonstrated how he used them, and with what slash he chipped his  victim, and with what slice he chopped him. He would have told why a  slash was enough for this man and why that man should be sliced. All men  are masters when one is young, and Fionn would have found knowledge here  also. He would have seen Fiacuil's great spear that had thirty rivets  of Arabian gold in its socket, and that had to be kept wrapped up and  tied down so that it would not kill people out of mere spitefulness. It  had come from Faery, out of the Shi' of Aillen mac Midna, and it would  be brought back again later on between the same man's shoulder-blades.    What tales that man could tell a boy, and what questions a boy could ask  him. He would have known a thousand tricks, and because our instinct is  to teach, and because no man can keep a trick from a boy, he would show  them to Fionn.    There was the marsh too; a whole new life to be learned; a complicated,  mysterious, dank, slippery, reedy, treacherous life, but with its own  beauty and an allurement that could grow on one, so that you could  forget the solid world and love only that which quaked and gurgled.    In this place you may swim. By this sign and this you will know if it is  safe to do so, said Fiacuil mac Cona; but in this place, with this sign  on it and that, you must not venture a toe.    But where Fionn would venture his toes his ears would follow.    There are coiling weeds down there, the robber counselled him; there are  thin, tough, snaky binders that will trip you and grip you, that will  pull you and will not let you go again until you are drowned; until  you are swaying and swinging away below, with outstretched arms, with  outstretched legs, with a face all stares and smiles and jockeyings,  gripped in those leathery arms, until there is no more to be gripped of  you even by them.    \"Watch these and this and that,\" Fionn would have been told, \"and always  swim with a knife in your teeth.\"    He lived there until his guardians found out where he was and came after  him. Fiacuil gave him up to them, and he was brought home again to  the woods of Slieve Bloom, but he had gathered great knowledge and new  supplenesses.    The sons of Morna left him alone for a long time. Having made their  essay they grew careless.    \"Let him be,\" they said. \"He will come to us when the time comes.\"    But it is likely too that they had had their own means of getting  information about him. How he shaped? what muscles he had? and did  he spring clean from the mark or had he to get off with a push? Fionn  stayed with his guardians and hunted for them. He could run a deer down  and haul it home by the reluctant skull. \"Come on, Goll,\" he would say  to his stag, or, lifting it over a tussock with a tough grip on the  snout, \"Are you coming, bald Cona'n, or shall I kick you in the neck?\"    The time must have been nigh when he would think of taking the world  itself by the nose, to haul it over tussocks and drag it into his  pen; for he was of the breed in whom mastery is born, and who are good  masters.    But reports of his prowess were getting abroad. Clann-Morna began to  stretch itself uneasily, and, one day, his guardians sent him on his  travels.    \"It is best for you to leave us now,\" they said to the tall stripling,  \"for the sons of Morna are watching again to kill you.\"    The woods at that may have seemed haunted. A stone might sling at one  from a tree-top; but from which tree of a thousand trees did it come? An  arrow buzzing by one's ear would slide "]]]
